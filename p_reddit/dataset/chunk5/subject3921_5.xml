"Jay, it's getting out of hand over here!"

I lifted my welding visor, turned off my cutting flare, and got out my radio. This high up, only the red mountain and golden beams were my neighbors, and the guys battling the blue shit down on the ground were ants. "What area?"

"Left corner of the leg, and over a bit."

I saw. I switched frequencies. "You guys got the living flames yet?"

My buddy's response came quickly. "Yes, the higher-ups managed to contact them. They're just coming in now."

"Send them over near the left corner of the leg. The icefire's gotten too big," I told him, studying the situation from my perch.

"Will do."

The icefire was dangerous as hell, but it was our only option for holding back the GLORWOC while we worked. It needed heat and oxygen, they said, and we'd seen the perfect tool back home: the cold green flames that spread ice everywhere. It ate the oxygen and chilled the ground, and the sick glowing blue infection dimmed and slowed underneath. GLORWOC wasn't gone, not in the least, but we had time to work - assuming the icefire didn't get us first.

The one saving grace of the work was the lack of sun. Around me, a couple hundred men used hastily imported tools to cut away at the Mictlan's leg. We were miles high, on account of starting somewhere the infection wouldn't reach before we were done, and the only thing above us was pure black nothing. In one direction, the wide metal landscape dropped sharper and sharper down to the rocky earth, and, in the other, a huge dome with a strange steel palace on top marked the Mictlan's head or central parts or whatever was over there. We didn't dare go near.

Our work was starting to show. An inch-thick line of melted metal ran from one edge of the leg to the other, and we were just packing up the harnesses and hanging structures that had let us slice through the bottom and sides. It was a several-month project, and outside my skillset, but we'd had to get it done in less than a day. We'd lost more than a few to falls.

I watched the ground far below just long enough to see a troop of orange living flames start containing the green icefire, and then I lowered my welding visor and turned back to my work. I tried not to think about the infected worlds we'd thrown icefire into and then sealed off. Nothing conventional seemed to stop the flames. Would those worlds have freezer burn for the rest of time? We'd cauterized and bandaged whole realities, and that was just going to be the start of our pains.

I was thinking of my daughters, too, and their mom - and that distraction cost me. The thick metal plate beneath me gave way, and I fell; not miles down to the ground, but probably worse. I fell into the inner workings of the Mictlan.

The guys were above me in a flash, shouting and hollering for ropes and help, but I was stuck hanging by my harness and staring. We'd all thought the thing was a giant machine, but there was nothing mechanical inside. Instead, I hung between two gigantic muscle fibers that ran along the metal shell overhead. Giant nerve tubes pulsed, and I saw violet liquid spurting up and drying in mounds to form scabs around where we were cutting - it was shoring up its insides for the amputation.

And it was probably feeling pain. It wasn't a machine at all.

Roger was the first to check me out when the guys pulled me back up, but I didn't tell them what I'd seen. I didn't want them to know we were hurting somebody in doing this. That thing, the Mictlan, was alive and had a soul - probably a soul bigger than any of ours, what with the ages it must have seen and the dead it herded. It would probably blow a fuse in that damn evil book they had back at headquarters if someone tried to read the Mictlan's soul directly

"Come on," Roger told me, slapping my cheek lightly. "You're gettin' tired. Makin' mistakes. Time for you to get down and get some rest."

"We can rest when the job's done," I told him, but the rest of the guys wouldn't have it. We'd all seen far too many men fall for far too long before they'd hit that horrible blood ocean straight beneath us. It was crusting over now, becoming scabby and hard, but it still stank enough to reach us up there. I climbed into our rigged pulley system and tried not to breathe that sick stench as they rolled me down for twenty or thirty minutes.

Roger'd been right. I actually fell asleep halfway down, and only woke up when my boots hit crusted scab. Groggy, I unhooked myself, and waved a green flag somebody had left nearby for signaling. Then, I started walking.

A good number of the invisible dead weren't invisible anymore. Pulsing gross blue ran up their bodies, eating away at them. They stayed far back, though, in the quarantine areas. More living people than I liked were also stuck with them, holding each other and talking quietly about their lives and the things they'd seen and wanted to do. We couldn't use the icefire on them without killing them, so there was nothing to be done. They, at least, were whole. Those who had only slight bits of infection had gotten the first amputations.

Me? They took my ear, of all things. My right ear. Just a bit had to be sliced off, but it still hurt like hell, and the bandage kept itching. Others had not been so lucky. I saw them lying in triage tents or trying to help out. Not a lot of good a guy with one arm or a woman with one leg could do for us - they kept getting refused, and sent back to the main work coordination area. They couldn't get sent home, though. Nobody could.

We couldn't risk a single bit of the infection getting out. That meant waiting days to see if creeping blue started gnawing at you - and we didn't have days left to work with. Another spout burst open as I walked across the rocks on my way to the sleeping tents. While dodging the blasting grey liquid, I reported it on my radio, and the guys in the mountain sealed the crack a minute later. We had *some* control, but the cracks were getting more frequent. Only a full seal would protect us, they'd said, but that would mean we could never leave. I just wanted to see Madison and Chloe again, and a lot of others had families, too, so that wasn't acceptable just yet.

But I knew that soon we'd - 

Something burst to my right, and a wall of dry water knocked me to the hard ground. My head rang with a painful impact, and I climbed out of the flood with a desperate push of willpower. I watched as the head guys sealed that crack - and another shot out to my left. I understood, then. Did they?

My radio was gone. Where was my radio? Still dizzy, and feeling like I was looking out my own eyes down a long tunnel, I caught sight of my walkie tumbling over the rocks. The waters had taken it.

They kept trying to seal the cracks, but more just kept rupturing nearby. I stumbled away as the entire area exploded.

I couldn't focus, but I knew what they were going to do. They were going to start sealing us in here for real. Everyone back at the coordination area would begin panicking and running, so they would close those rifts first and then all of the obvious exits after that. I had an idea, but it terrified me.

One look at the towering Mictlan gave me determination: thousands of men were swarming down from its mountainous metal leg. They were panicked, yes, but we'd all agreed to stay until the job was done - no matter what. That meant they'd just finished. The Mictlan would be snapping its leg off and rising up to escape while the rest of us -

Another surprise torrent hit me from the side, and I barely powered through it. The ground had begun rumbling from every direction, but all I could hear was the roar of racing waterfalls. I tried not to think about how bad this was. It felt like the end, but I kept pushing forward over rocks and through rushing dry water. If I somehow got out of this - if I somehow made it safe - what would happen when we lost the main generator? I couldn't think about that while the ground was shaking so hard; too much panic, too much adrenaline.

There was nothing to hold onto outside the Mictlan. It couldn't take us with it, and that was why the guys were abandoning it. I slowed my run, breathing hard, and not sure where to go. There was only one other possible idea - but no, that was crazy -

My hair whipped around my face as a crack exploded to my left. I hit the rocks hard once again, but got up and ran without a moment's delay. I'd have to try it.

Swarms of people were running about in the distance, but I was closer to the second worksite than most. The guys here were climbing and jumping down, too, but I had the opposite idea.

This close, the mass of shadow flesh was a gigantic wall of writhing limbs, eyes, mouths, and unidentifiable horrors. A good part of it glowed blue, but we'd isolated those areas. I grabbed black hands that managed to be shadow cold and skin warm at the same time, and began climbing. The shadow hands gripped mine and helped me ascend - was it because of our new alliance, or because something horrific waited beyond the sky, eager to eat me? They caught me, too, when a tremendous quake hit below and shook me free.

The waters were pouring in from every direction, now, and I'd only made it a hundred or so feet up as grey surged across the ground below. A couple hundred other people had seen me and gotten my crazy idea, and they climbed frantically after me. Rising winds and spraying mists pushed at me, and I clamped onto thrashing black limbs to let the gusts pass.

There was no going back now. Hanging there, I tried to shake off my concussion and exhaustion, but it was all too much. From here, I could see all the people that I'd worked alongside running for their lives. The crushing grey overtook them like a tidal wave, washing away corpse-things, people, and the blood sea alike in one tremendous surge. Some of my friends had been close enough, maybe, to get inside the mountain and close those big doors. I prayed they'd thought to do that.

I still wasn't safe. Space cracked in the air, and slicing grey splashed against me with enough force that I almost lost my grip. Strong hands pulled me higher, and I started climbing again. The other men had caught up, and we now pulled our way up together, heading for that bleeding slice we'd made high above - the amputation, stalled mid-job.

That was it! That was why the shadow creatures were helping us. They couldn't pull out and leave until the miles-wide surgery was done.

The black blood pouring down from above made the going slick and tricky, but we hit a mile up with the help of leering animal faces and grasping claws. At the end of my strength, I pushed up onto flat bleeding gore and rolled away from the edge. Others followed, and worried hands pulled me to my feet.

We stood in a big cleft, like an axe gap somebody had made in a nearly-felled tree. High above us and right beneath our feet, bleeding veins a foot wide leaked endless streams of black goop. There were no faces and limbs here - this was solid muscle, veins, and nerves. Through my despair and fear, I did still realize: *these things were alive, too, just like the Mictlan.*

And they were afraid. These godlike creatures, as blasphemous as that description was - they were afraid of what was happening. They were going to die with us, here, if they couldn't escape. This high up, I looked out to the Mictlan, in time to see it using two raised limbs to puncture the distant empty sky. As the world shook, it squeezed its way into that small gap and through, like a spider compressing itself into a hidey-hole. It didn't look like it could fit, but, somehow, it did. The crack it left sealed behind it, probably thanks to the efforts of those men in the mountain.

We'd done it: we'd amputated one of its legs and freed it. Would it honor the alliance? I couldn't possibly know about such things. I watched the grey floods surge over the miles-long metal chunk of itself the Mictlan had left behind. Small figures atop that piece ran for their lives, but they were swiftly overtaken.

The men around me had run, too, heading deeper into the cleft in the shadow flesh. They looked like they were planning to reach the place where the gap narrowed so that they could start climbing again, and that was just fine - but I'd promised not to leave until the job was done. A whole lot more than just my life was riding on this. That much, I knew. Feeling sick, I slogged after them, but angled toward the place where flesh met flesh, and the site where the workmen had left their blasting tools and explosives.

By the light of distant golden beams, I began setting up the last of the bombs in crucial goopy crevices. I tried to secure them against the constant earthquakes traveling up our pillar of living insanities, but they kept bouncing around - whatever, it was the best I could do. I normally had more pride for a job, but I couldn't see through my own tears.

A splash of dry water hit me from behind, but I kept working. Black muscle fibers squeezed up and held space shut behind me.

I thought I might actually finish in time - until I felt the shift.

I wasn't just getting tired. Things were actually getting heavier.

The tools weighed more. My clothes dragged at me. I could feel my heart hammering in my chest, just trying to keep my blood pumping. A half-mile to my right, I saw a figure fall away past the cleft - someone had lost hold and been pulled down much faster than normal.

"I should never have come here with you," I said to nobody in particular, but thinking of Noah, wherever he'd ended up in the chaos. "I shouldn't be doing this, either."

But I was, because somebody had to. The detonation fuses had all been washed away by grey waters surging over black goop, and the only thing I had left was a direct line to the bombs. The miles of black flesh above and beneath me quivered and tensed, anticipating the pain. I didn't tense up. I doubted I would feel a thing.

I hoped they would use that book on me. I hoped that Madison and Chloe would find out, and understand. I hoped they would never forget this moment.

Screaming against what I was about to do, I pressed the detonation button.

Nothing happened.

Oh, shit, that was way worse. The shadow pillar couldn't leave! If we couldn't honor the alliance -

I tinkered with the bombs, and even hit a few with my fist while I screwed up my face against a possible explosion. No - they wouldn't go off like that. We'd failed.

What else was there to do? I sat on my knees in that sludge, at a loss. Every breath was a hard task, now, as the gravity grew more intense.

I only saw them out of the corner of my eye. They were floating up all around, but I was deep in the pillar. One floated forward, studying me - and the bombs.

I didn't know if I should move. I stared at the orange ball of flame as it grew closer. Could it see me? Did it have eyes? Did it think?

It motioned a little flickering tendril to its right - my left. I followed that angle with my eyes and saw the edge where everyone else had climbed up. Was it?

*Go,* it said, making speech-like noises with little gusts of heated air. *One bubble, safe, orthogonal. Very special. Find.*

I didn't understand what it was trying to tell me, but I did understand the word *go*. I tried to run, but I weighed too much. I stumbled, fell, and began crawling toward an edge that looked out onto blasting water-filled skies among tremendous golden beams. Behind me, I saw the floating flame approach the bombs. I screamed at it, but it didn't wait.

A leering shadow-face bent down in front of mine, and a dozen hands grabbed me all over.

The bombs went off in a successive line, deafening me, and severing the last of the pillar. The concussive wave ripped parts of my clothes away, but the hands on me lifted me higher. Freed from its own weight, the pillar above shot up into the empty sky. Clamped to its bottom, I watched as the pocket world fell away. That churning mess of icefire, GLORWOC, and compressed space spilled into the bases of the beams of light, and I knew that the main generator would not last much longer even as darkness overtook my sight.

One chilly-warm shadow hand clamped over my eyes. Two more squished my ears. Whatever was out there, they did not want me to see it. Was it for their protection, or mine? Incredible freezing winds whipped at what was left of my clothes and burnt my skin, but I was not dying - instead, those hands released me, and I fell into a sea of high wheat.

A large crowd of men slowly stood around me, laughing and shaking hands as they realized where we were.

We'd finished the job, and we'd survived. The shadows had honored our new alliance and delivered us unharmed.

But how long would our safety last?

Our smiles faded as an explosion rang out on the horizon. We turned to see a grey tidal wave erupting into the clear blue sky. Many of us fell out of sheer despair, but I began running. The shadows had not delivered us to safety, because safety no longer existed. The end was *now*, *today*, and nothing short of a miracle would save us. The living flame had said something to me about a very special bubble of safety, but I had no idea what it had meant. I had to hope someone else would find it for all of us; find it for Madison, Chloe, and their mother.

I was tired and dizzy, but I kept running. I had three very important people that I wanted to see before the end. Not even the high wave dimming the sun could stop me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought some of you might enjoy this short story. It's been out for quite awhile in the [book version of Psychosis that also contains 12 other stories.](http://www.amazon.com/Psychosis-Tales-Horror-Matt-Dymerski-ebook/dp/B005DSU784/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1439346108 sr=8-1 keywords=matt+dymerski+psychosis) This was written somewhere between 2010 and 2012, but has a connection to the Moon Aflame (which is done and processing on Amazon now). Rather than include it in that book, I thought I'd put it here.

Subject: What do you make of this?

Dr. Batten,

I found this during the cataloguing project -

 
[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]

[red scribbles]

Dav [fading red pen]

Da [fading blue pen]

David [heavy black pen from here on]

David David David david

David Messer

Use as journal, order thoughts [written sideways]

Room 36

[crude drawn map of a building, Room 36 at the maps center]

Where is everyone?? [written at an angle in the corner]

Finally found some food, and have retreated to room for the night. Sun setting soon. I cant find the words to express how good it feels to write again. The sleek pen in my fingers, the rough matte of the paper against my hand, and the sheer physicality of the act itself brings me untold joy, reminding me in every little way that I am once again experiencing the real world. Ah, its snowing outside! Its not snowing, that is part of my delusions. It still laps at the edges of my consciousness like a puddle held at bay by the wind. Another, stranger force pushes against it in my mind, a waking nightmare

[black scribbles]

cannot be described without the sliding sliding back into the dream where I have been trapped for so long. Not the same dream, a different one, someone elses I can feel the two fighting over my mind like hungry wolves, viruses spiraling in combat, leaving me mostly free from both for the first time in eternities. I would like to find the date, to know how long I have been here. And also, to find out what happened to the staff. Its been so long since it snowed! [last phrase struck through by a line] Will look for a newspaper in the morning.

12/17/2014

Very satisfactory lunch. Its my second time consciously tasting food in 9 years, if I remember my last waking memories correctly. We fortified the buildings front door and sealed all other entrances. The other patients are all exhibiting cessation of neuroses as well, and we collectively decided to protect the building until we can determine the fate of the staff and others.

The streets outside, viewed via window, are empty. We should go play in the snow! Cars litter the streets, in some cases still running. No sign of struggle. Expedition has been proposed to gather resources. Not sure if I should mention the nightmare-presence I feel in my mind. Cannot determine if the other patients are feeling it. How are former mental patients supposed to act?

12/18/2014

Frank Ditmer has been acting as leader, doing a good job. They went out and came back with a large amount of supplies. No other people encountered as of yet, and no evidence as to their fate. All the cars left running are now empty of gas; Ditmer and crew turned off as many as they could in case we need to use them. Do you mind if I go play in the snow, daddy? [last sentence aggressively struck through, but still legible]

Heard a distinct phrase in the nightmare waters washing around the outsides of my mind; another patient, Kelly Jackson, said it out loud. At this point we have all realized that we are feeling the same external influence. Atmosphere is tense, though surprisingly stable. It seems each of us are clear of thought while the dark waves stalemate our various dementias.

Same force responsible for disappearance of everyone else?

12/19/2014

We put on music and had a good old-fashioned dance today. No idea how long this clarity will last. Danced with Kelly, nearly cried at the touch of another person again. Fortunately I held it in; I still have my dignity. Still no sign of any other people. Talking with people and forming friendships is exhilarating. Sure, you can go play in the snow, Ill be right out. I was not aware of the passage of time, but it seems my body was. I crave interaction like a drug.
 
Frank is right. We are going to have to go out and search for the others eventually, as much as this place feels like rebirth and home. ngyah treth. We might not even be safe. We have to find out where they went. I plan to volunteer. I want to see the world again, for however long I have. Shed want that of me, to live again, to be happy again, for as long as I can manage.

12/20/2014

Bitter cold. Sun is setting, and the three of us have stopped for the night in an abandoned house. Heat still works, but we are only keeping on a tiny light in the basement for fear of being seen by threats as yet unknown. Maps found at a bus station indicate that we are now two miles from the northern edge of Columbus, Ohio. How I got here from Florida, where my family lives (lived?) Ill never know. Its so cold outside, I wish I was still there.

Franks a good guy. Smart too. I think he was once a professor, like me. He wont talk about his dementia, though. Each of us keeps that to ourselves, for fear of the problem returning, or of being judged, its impossible to say. I know what they would say if they heard my delusion, that it wasnt my fault, that accidents happen, but those words meant nothing to me nine years ago, and they will mean nothing now. Eyah sakagra. [last phrase struck out]  ?  ? Kelly sleeping next to me, will write more later.

12/[unknown symbol]/2014

The balance of the waters in my mind, dark and sinister on one side, and the blinding white of winter on the other, shifts the closer we get to the center of the city. Walked very slowly and [symbol] for most of the short daylight, once we heard the sound on the wind. The day was unnaturally short, even for winter. We are resting now in an unlocked restaurant in a pseudo-suburban area looks like a large college campus. I am grateful to have almost no troubling thoughts from my personal demons, but fearful of those demons that are not mine, who continue to whisper strange words and pictures.

[symbol] terrified. Reached the city center, now hiding in the underground parking garages. Entire population of others seems all still alive, but under mental influence.
 
We can hear them now, tens of thousands, chanting above. It was only luck that they didnt see us. [symbol]. Frank believes the foreign influence on us is the cause, I agree. Why we remain unaffected  perhaps our inherent insanity helps us resist the foreign one. [symbol] in the morning.

From creeping about, we briefly got up the internal stairs into the 34th floor of the [symbol] building, saw some sort of gigantic [symbol] to randomly shifting places and times appearing to slowly grow in front of the capitol building, as tens of thousands [symbol] and worshipped it. Frank is grim, Kelly terrified. I want to encourage her, make her feel better, but I am relearning all of my emotions again, and dont know what to say. All I know is, it would be foolish to assume that the [symbol] will stay random forever. All of this has the signs of a horrific attack on the human race.

[symbol] / [symbol] / [symbol]

Running out of food. Frank caught and got killed [symbol] nights ago, stings my heart bitterly. Fanatics now aware of the existence of non-controlled, and are searching the high rises for us. Kelly is now speaking half in the other language, half in English. She refuses to physically let go of me at any time. I am making a distinct conscious effort to write correctly. I have only one plan. We are trapped.

I saw, out a window into a window, in another building, seven fanatics walk into a certain room and suddenly become confused. They looked around in terror, until they left the room, and resumed their mind-controlled behavior. [symbol] means there is something that resists the effects of the [symbol]. This behavior happened on the 32nd floor of the building south of the [symbol] building, two rooms from the east end.

That portal is my only idea. I can see the light of awareness leaving Kellys eyes, and I can hear the fanatics racing up the stairs. Im [symbol] either way, so I might as well try. Im going to try to make it to the roof and throw this book into the [symbol]. Wish me [symbol]. And if this lands in some time or place before 2005 I beg you to find a David Messer in Miami, Florida, and tell him not to let his daughter play in the snow. I have

I already checked, and there is in fact a David Messer in a psychiatric hospital near Columbus, Ohio in the United States. I have to be honest, this is rather disturbing.

Subject: Re: What do you make of this?

Mark,

Weve uncovered over thirty different documents purported to be from wildly different times and places, all describing these events in 2014, all supposedly written by different cured psychiatric patients in different cities all over the world. Its a widespread and enduring hoax that, frankly, has this institution on its last nerve. Please have the item destroyed. Also, try exercising some scholarly skepticism in the future. Thanks.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> At the time, I did think it was weird, but I had no idea what had found me. It was the opposite of a noise, really. The nocturnal sounds of the forest faded away without warning. Leafy silhouettes still moved across the stars overhead, but I heard no breeze. My friends were talking around the campfire, but I watched their moving mouths as if from behind soundproof glass. Just as I realized the depth of my involuntarily tune out, that un-noise began.

Have you ever imagined what it would be like to fly unhindered through the depths of space? I'd once dreamt that I'd had the powers of a superhuman, and that I'd held my arms forward as I'd soared through endless speckled darkness. In my uncontrolled imagination, the universe out there had not been silent. The drawn out, expansive, and deep cosmic note I'd heard in that dream was now present in my waking senses. It rolled and changed over the subtle moments, bringing me a sensation of incredible emptiness and cold. That noise was an impossible echo from walls of the universe that should have been too far away to reach, let alone return from.

The sensation passed, and campfire conversations began reaching my ears again. I shivered, then, and whenever I think about it now. The experience left me unsettled, but I chalked it up to those random moments of sensory weirdness that most people seemed to get from time to time. I couldn't possibly have known that I was no longer alone. Nobody noticed it in the pictures from that night, but I went back and looked once things starting getting weird. It was there, standing in the moonlight-dappled forest behind us: a darker shadow against the night that was only visible with the pictures' contrasts turned up.

Everybody looked so happy. We stood around the fire, smiling, beers in hand. Nobody had any idea that we were being watched or followed.

I was grumpy on the drive back. There was no other way to describe it. The morning light was irritating, the car was cramped, and my fast-food burrito was tasteless. My friends teased me, saying that I must have been hung over, but I was in no mood for it. I'd only had three beers. No, this felt like a leech on my very brain.

Many of us went our separate ways back in the city, but my two roommates continued taking pictures and talking while on the way to our apartment. We were just walking in and dropping our things when one of the girls snapped a photo of 'the grumpus' - me - and then dropped her phone with a shriek.

Even as she explained what had frightened her, the living room began feeling enormous, lonely, and chilly, like I was standing on a distant and lifeless planet circling a dying star in a long-dead galaxy. The experience at the campfire that weekend shot back to me in an instant; I *knew.*

My two roommates had already picked the phone back up and begun staring at the picture.

It was me, standing in the living room, my bags on the floor, my gaze distant, low, and sad. She'd somehow managed to catch a moment that looked a classic painting of the concept of despair itself; that, and the demon that might have delivered that despair. Our living room had a high ceiling, and the fuzzy silhouette of a very gaunt figure reached nearly to the top. Starvation thin and startlingly tall, it stood in the back corner of the room, facing away from the phone that had taken the picture. Only one thing kept us from screaming our heads off and running out of the apartment: it was too hazy to really be sure it was a person.

One of us suggested that it was just a smudge on the lens or a random corruption in the picture file. That calmed us down for a moment - until we had the bright idea to take another shot.

The screams didn't stop for nearly two minutes; not until we reached the far end of the street.

That same figure was not only present in the second shot, it was one step closer, and angled slightly to the left - as if it was beginning to turn and face us. It was still hazy, and anyone else would have thought it just a weird blur, but I'd felt its timeless, lonely, and icy presence. I knew it was real.

I'd read stories like this, too. This was an entire class of haunting or demon or something; the stalking shadow, the tall humanoid figure, the step-by-step progression toward something terrible I had them take another picture, this time of the street. They screamed again, and I grabbed the phone.

It stood now on the sidewalk half a block away, facing directly to the side. Pitch black slashes in the haze hinted at the beginnings of facial features turning our way.

I shouted for help at a random man on a bike, and he came over. At first, he thought one of us had been injured or something, but he took the phone in confusion as I explained our situation. He took one look at the picture and handed it back, eyes wide. He thought he was on a prank show, of course, and took off, but that was confirmation the hazy entity was really in the picture.

The first solution was simple enough. I told my roommates that we could never take pictures ever again.

They didn't like that at all. One of them brought up a legitimate concern: what if other people took pictures of us? Weren't Google satellites or whatever taking pics from the sky all the time? Would the shadow show up in those? Could we look it up on Google Earth? Google Street View?

They both had their phones out halfway through that line of reasoning, but I knew they would never find anything. Those aerial images were only taken every so often, and we'd never find a random dark smudge in them. They were right, though, that other people could take pictures of us and potentially advance the haunting. We couldn't control every photographer in the world

We went to the church down the street and snapped another picture, hoping that it was a religious type of demon that abhorred sanctity.

It didn't care at all. It stood tall among the pews, a shadow with black slices for features, nearly facing us now. Panicking and crying, one of my roommates ran out onto the street and took another picture. Whatever she saw made her go into hysterics, and we had to run her down. Grabbing her phone, I looked, heart pounding.

The picture of the street was entirely covered in hazy shade, with two darker lines framed perfectly. I stared at it for a moment, trying to understand - until, *in the static picture*, the pitch black slices opened to reveal two very human eyes. Those eyes rotated, looking about - first at me, and then at my roommates.

Those startlingly human eyes gazed at us from inside a picture. It actually *saw us.* Somehow, it was *looking out from the screen!*

Absolute terror froze every muscle in my body, at least until the shadow moved back from directly in front of the image. A thin hand began rising out from the screen itself. All I could do was drop the phone - and watch as it hit the pavement and shattered.

A hazy hand and wrist made of shadow plopped to the cement, and we three screamed together as it writhed around in the sunlight.

Men rushed over to see what was wrong, and one fainted as he saw the demonic hand still twitching and moving at random. Two guys pulled out their phones to take a video of it, but, thinking fast and from a place of utter terror, I smacked their hands hard enough to knock the devices away.

The transparent flesh began to sizzle on the sidewalk. In a few seconds, the sun burned away what remained, and a good six or seven of us stood in dumbfounded awe. They'd all seen it - but what could any of us do about it?

Still shaking, I was the first to act. I pulled out my phone and smashed it. My roommates' other phone joined that one, and we stomped the first even more. Those who had come and seen the creature did the same, just in case.

We all exchanged contact information and went our separate ways. As we'd agreed, we each took photos with new devices around our houses, cars, and the like. None showed the entity. I theorized that the haunting was tied to devices, and possibly time- or subject-related pictures.

But, see, I've already told you why I'm writing this general warning to all of you people out there. I was able to go back and see the entity in our campfire photos, lurking in the moonlight-dappled forest - because those pictures had already been uploaded to Facebook. We destroyed the devices it was on, but not the images in which it had originated. By the time I realized our mistake, the pictures had already been shared and liked by all of our friends.

Pictures taken with phones synced to those computers began showing the starving shadow. Webcams used for Skype sessions showed that hungry presence standing somewhere behind the victim. Each new image and video brought it closer to the photographer, and closer to climbing into our world. We got the word out to our friends, but some didn't believe us until the first unexplained disappearance.

And that tidbit in the news prompted the horror sharing sites. They got wind of our images and videos and started posting them everywhere. *Real Scary Ghost Video - You Will Be Shocked!* or *What Is This Shadow Behind OP?* or *Unbelievable entity footage will make you believe!* I saw it spread all across the Internet, and I knew there was nothing we could do to stop it. Calling attention to it and trying to get it removed would only make things worse.

That lonely and hungry entity that had first come to me in the woods on that cloudless night, surrounded by and filled with the emptiness and lifelessness of the universe - it's out there now, alive in pictures and videos. It's not going to end the human race, or even *get* most of us, but there are more cell phones in the world now than people, and more and more photos being taken every single day, and we can't possibly get the word out to everyone:

Be careful what you look at online - it might just look back at you. </TEXT>

"Conn, do you think this is really going to work?"

Taking one more scan of the forested ridge and shattered multi-colored sky, I lowered my rifle. I turned to the version of Noah that had spoken. He'd scrawled *1408* on his emerald breastplate with a black marker. Behind me, two long columns of Noahs continually flowed past each other on their way into and out of a very strange canyon, duplicating themselves and many of the weapons and tools we'd retrieved from one of Cristina's long-secured stashes. "Depends on how long we can stay here," I told Noah-1408. "I don't like the lack of threats and people. It's eerie."

Noah-1138 overheard us. "Yes, the first time we were here, some spider-like predator was feasting on the duplicates that came out later than the originals."

"I thought neither are truly the original? That they're both the same?"

"Well, feasting on the ones that came out later than the first ones, then."

In truth, the whole business of quantum duplication made me uncomfortable. Which ones were real? Which ones were fake? If they were *all* real, with no discernible difference, well - who got to live the original life? Stepping a bit further down the ridge to get away from the growing crowds of Noahs, I returned my eyes to the oddly quiet trees.

Overhead, numerous patches of color drifted across the sky. Some were unsafe simply of their own accord; a certain dark purple slice still had me tense. The Noahs, who had all been immune somehow, had had to tie me and Cristina down to keep us from clawing our own eyes out. She'd known ahead of time and told them what to do. For that, and for a great many other reasons, I considered her the greatest woman in the world.

But none of the other threats she'd warned us about had materialized. This crazily lit and empty world sat very near the edge of the Shield, but none of the expected threats were present. The silent waiting was worse than actually fighting horrible monsters.

I saw her coming up the ridge before she saw me. Excited, but well-trained, I remained at my post until she arrived. Her brown hair had grown longer since our exile - her first, and my second - and it whipped idly in the apathetic but constant breeze.

My smile lifted some of her lately constant grimness. She turned her face away and laughed. "Stop looking at me like that."

"Like what?" I asked, my grin growing wider. "Oh wow, it's Cristina Thompson, destroyer and savior of worlds! I wonder if I can get an autograph."

She put on a mock deadly serious expression and lowered her voice. "My autographs might blow up your planet."

"Wow, what would a date do, then, if just autographs already rock my world?"

Her fake seriousness cracked.

I wiggled my eyebrows.

"Stop!" she said with another laugh, pushing me.

I was about to say something further, but I felt thousands of eyes on us. The Noahs could all sense emotion, and the two of us were a weird bundle of the most extreme opposites. I coughed and straightened my military pose. "How was the scouting run?"

"There's nothing out there," she replied, focused once more. "A few people still running power plants, dams, that sort of thing. They have no information about the bigger picture. Valiant fools." She glanced past me. "How's the army building coming?"

"Up to two-thousand and forty-eight supremely equipped Noahs," I reported. "In a few hours, we'll be up to four-thousand and ninety-six. By tomorrow, twice that again."

She turned her head, as if listening to a distant voice.

All of the Noahs around us fixated on her.

I knew it was bad. "What's up?"

Her high cheeks went pale. "We'll have to go with the two thousand we have."

"Why?"

She met my gaze, a rare vulnerability clear in her eyes. "It's happening."

So Ward Shaw had telepathically updated her on the situation, and the final collapse was imminent. Studying the environment around us, with its calm forests and broken sky, I frowned. "Why is this place fine?"

"I don't know," she said, her tone soft and distant. "The shattered walls may be diverting pressure elsewhere, but we can't be sure. Keep it in your head as a puzzle piece." There was no need for her to inform the Noahs; they could feel her intent. "Let's head out. Everyone has their missions."

Sticking close to her, I followed her back down the ridge to a pulsating crack in reality between two trees. Noahs Two through Two-Hundred followed us, the first squad of ten. The other nine had their own destinations, but we would all have to work together once we reached them.

I had no doubt the teams would accomplish their journeys; they were naturally immune to mental attacks by virtue of being Noahs, and equipped with gemstone weapons that would deal horrific death to any physical threats. Cristina had only had the one set of stolen armor and a single weapon, but that peculiar canyon had doubled our Noahs and gear each subsequent few hours.

I could tell that the sheer *time* it had cost us had weighed hard on her. Ward Shaw had continually sent her updates about the slaughter of millions at the main Shield generator, but our geometric growth here had required us to stay back and wait. By the time we'd had enough strength to matter, GLORWOC had already infected the battlefield, and the tragedy had expanded exponentially.

Now our plan to help without the Council's approval had become a backup Hail Mary. If we could reach every backup generator in each Amber World, we could coordinate them to sustain the Shield by themselves. Each Amber World, too, had cracked open under the final stages of the Crushing Fist. Thanks to that mixed blessing, we could get inside them. That meant there was still a chance.

I kept my head down as we stumbled through the raving inbetweens. The ground, to me, looked like white hospital floor tiles. I supposed part of me would always be sitting there in that hallway, on that bench, waiting. I wondered what Cristina saw, but I respected the pain on her face.

The Noahs were very verbal about the horrible slog they were supposedly wading through. They all saw the same thing, and reported it as glimmering dust that pulled at them like tar. That was the same thing Noah Two had seen on his way to this world with us, and I had to feel bad for them. The walk was almost easy for me - other than the sadness, of course.

We emerged into a shaking forest underneath a gloomy blue sky that ran dark with weird splotches of light shadow. It was as if water had gotten behind the sky somehow, and was sliding up against it.

Keeping her footing while the ground shook, Cristina studied those splotches, concerned. As we all watched, the first of them burst - and a spraying torrent of dim water arced across the dome of the sky. To our left, another spout burst from the very air, and some rained down on us.

At first, we lunged away, but it didn't seem to be harmful. By the time it reached us, the spray was just a drizzle, and Cristina held out her hands to let some pool between her closed fingers. In wonder, she tipped it back and forth. "It's *heavy.*"

"Heavy?" I asked, looking over her shoulder alongside a dozen Noahs. "Heavier water?"

"It's not water," she realized aloud. "It's *compressed space.*" She opened her hands and let it fall to the ground, where it pooled on the leaf-covered dirt. "So this is how it happens"

"Compressed space?" Noah-57 asked. "I thought white holes would get us."

She shook her head. "The First World's shield focused all the pressure into a single point. This is more general, and all around us. The higher-dimensional pressure is literally compressing space into a liquid form. Those of us down in gravity wells are going to be the first to go."

I shuddered. "What do we do?"

She shook her head. "Run. Avoid drowning, or being crushed by the sheer weight of the compressed space. Enact our plan as fast as we can."

We began jogging as a unit, at a pace that might soon exhaust us - but there was no choice. We ran along high trails and down forested slopes, angling through cracks in space between realities. At each one, Cristina checked her hastily drawn map, comparing notes about the environs to confirm we were on course.

In each new world, we jogged under high visible cracks in dim blue. In each new world, grey ethereal liquid shot across the sky in colossal spouts, sometimes raining down on us in heavy little droplets. It didn't soak our clothes. Just the opposite: it pelted us and rolled off, pooling underneath our feet and splashing out of the way as we slammed our shoes down onto dry earth. It was an arid flood.

We were still eleven winding reality transitions distant from our target Amber World, judging by our map, when the worst possible turn of events happened. We'd climbed higher up onto barren mountain rocks to proceed, but the words echoed in our minds, not from stone.

**Arrogant supplicants before God, how dare ye strive to make His will reality?**

I bent over in pain and screamed as the words burned against the inside of my skull, and Cristina hunched over, too - but she had her gun out, and aimed at the Noahs behind us. They each looked wary and normal. None had converted. Just like we'd counted on, they were immune.

**Only those of the Anti-Faith will lift from the pains of this world. Join in unbelief, and unmake the imposter God on high! Free your eternal souls from His tyranny!**

Beside me, Cristina began to shake off the pain with a violent trembling anger. Her face flushed beet red, and a line of spittle descended from her lips.

As she balled her fists, I threw off the powerful headache and grabbed her. "No!"

"*I have to!*" she screamed, fighting me off. "*This might be our only chance!*"

**Even ye, heretic, who has decried the Word. Even ye may join us in eternal choir.**

On guard, our two hundred Noahs scanned the gloomy drizzle-shadowed mountainside, but none could locate the Preacher itself. "It's like a cloud of people," one commented, confused. "They're all around us - screaming. That multitude of screams forms that voice you're hearing."

"*I know*," Cristina grunted, furious. 

I fought to keep her from running off. "Cristina, I understand, I do, but it's literally raining compressed space on us. It's the end of the world!"

"*This is our chance!*" she screamed at the top of her lungs. "The Noahs are immune, and we've got the weapons. We can do it, Conn. We've got that godforsaken thing dead to rights!"

Tears rolled down my face. I knew. I also knew there was no choice. "There's no time," I cried. "You don't know what you're going to face ahead. You have to take these men, these weapons, and you have to save everyone. You might kill the Preacher, but then we'll all die soon after because of the time we waste chasing it."

She bit my arm hard, drawing blood, but she failed to get away. "I don't care. Dying happens to everyone eventually. But that thing has our daughter's *soul*, Conn. It crept into that graveyard and it stole their bodies and took their *souls*. And I can't forgive myself for failing to save her for all these years."

The Preacher continued broadcasting its Unholy Word into my mind, but I was at peace. I knew what I had to do, and what it would cost. "Crissy."

She slowed her flailing assault and stared at me. "Don't."

"Let me take care of it," I said, utterly calm. "I'll take care of the Preacher, and you go on and save the Shield. Trust me to do this."

"No." This time, her refusal was different. She wasn't saying it out of rage, but love.

"It's the only way," I told her. "It's gotta be why I'm here. If either of us have faith in the bigger picture at all, I gotta believe I survived all this time to stick by your side and reach this moment. Of all the people in the multiverse, I'm the only one as angry at the Preacher as you, and I'm the only one who might pull this off, and I just so happen to be here when you get one last shot at that evil bastard. I'm no good with the tech stuff, but I can fight, and I can love you. I'm *here* so that *you* can keep your heart focused. I'll protect your heart so that you can save the human race. Let me do this for you. I don't wanna die watching you guys mess with some consoles in a bunker somewhere. Let this be the way I go out."

She stepped back, her face red with every emotion other than anger.

Noah Two, with a solemn nod, handed me his wickedly smooth sapphire weapon. I hefted it, comparing its handling to the assault rifle on my back. It would do.

There was no final kiss, and no final emotional words. We'd already said our goodbyes in private, and we'd both known this was probably a one-way trip. She placed her hand flat on my chest for a few seconds, feeling my heartbeat, and then led her duplicate troops on into the strange storm ahead. 

Noah Two hung back for a moment, just long enough to hand me a small amethyst pyramid about an inch high. "Don't let the Preacher get you, buddy. If you think it's gonna happen" I understood, and slid the tiny suicide device into my pocket. The Preacher couldn't claim a corpse - or a soul - if there was nothing left to absorb, and I might just take it down with me in the process.

Noah Two ran off to join the others, and I darted a different direction.

**The messenger sees one has chosen to remain. Have ye forsaken the heretic?**

"I have," I lied aloud, shouting up to the high rocks. "I wish to join your eternal choir."

**Speak louder, insect. Praise the Word of Unbelief!**

"Come closer," I yelled, circling among the crags, my eyes searching every hiding place. Clattering sounds echoed somewhere to my left, and I aimed my sapphire rifle and pulled the trigger. A carved deep blue dodecahedron projectile sliced out from the gun, and the mountainside exploded. As rubble dispersed out into the air, something tremendous skittered away behind me. I whipped around.

That was it: a white, pink, and red amalgamation of semi-alive corpses in the shape of a gigantic spider that bore a human face. It was about half as tall as the trees around it, and moved with agile grace between them.

The hatred Cristina and I shared fueled me, and I fired again; the thing had planned well, though, and the mile between us gave it time to escape the second explosion. It had eluded Cristina all these years, so I knew it to be an expert at running and hiding. I needed to avoid giving it the chance to use those skills.

Running at top speed down the rocky mountainside, I barreled after it. I came into a wide clearing among the trees just in time to see it duck into a trembling crack in space. Sapphire rifle hefted, I followed across white hospital tiles and into a new world where the gloomy ethereal rain was pelting down at a much harder pace.

Splashing through the dry liquid, highly aware of the low visibility in the torrential downpour, I ducked behind a tree and scanned the rainy forest.

Nothing moved but swaying leaves and plopping heavy droplets. It hadn't run; not yet. It was lying in wait to -

I spun around and fired behind me.

The Preacher would have been hit dead on, had it not reflexively opened a hole through itself. The sapphire projectile sailed through and exploded harmlessly in the trees beyond, and the hole in the mass of corpse-flesh closed again.

My gun whined in response to another click, as it was still recharging, but the Preacher didn't know that. It leapt past me and ran, trampling bushes and small trees in panic.

**Heretic! Liar! The Anti-God will find and punish ye!**

Running after the beast, and ignoring the surging dry rain, I trampled the same bushes to keep up. I should have been tired, but I wasn't; I should have contemplated deeper strategies, but I didn't. That creature had my daughter's body and soul, and perhaps part of her mind, and I was closer than anyone had ever been to cornering it. Fire surged from somewhere deep inside me, fueling my heart and energizing my limbs.

I ran - no, I charged. I charged through the woods, right down the mountainside, and into firing range once more. My fourth sapphire projectile exploded next to it, rupturing one of its eight limbs. "Face me, scavenger!"

**Unworthy!**

It turned and threw one of its other limbs at me. A thick shard of corpses shattered the tree I was running past, and large wooden splinters shot into my side. I scrunched my face up hard and kept running, feeling warm blood leaking down underneath the weird dry rain that continued to roll off of me.

We both came to an open stretch of grassy dirt, and I tried for another shot.

Nothing happened.

Staring down at sapphire, I noticed a large wooden splinter jammed through one of the intricate mechanisms. "Oh, shit."

The Preacher stopped running, and turned to face me with slow glee.

I stood in place, judging my options. I was wounded by splinters, and they continually stabbed sharp little pains into my side. I would get weaker from blood loss, but I still had tremendous energy born of righteous rage. If I -

The ground vibrated beneath my shoes, but it was far different than the usual quakes. The Preacher ducked, and I dove into a gloomy grey pool. I'd caught a glimpse out of the corner of my eye, and I did not understand at all.

Both the Preacher and I hunkered down, hiding among sloshing compressed space, as more than twenty gigantic ruby cubes roared past overhead. The trembling beneath us intensified as one of them came down closer to hover right above us.

**Make no sound, no verbal praise,** the Preacher warned, an actual note of fear in its legion voice.

I didn't have to be told twice. Praying to anything and everything, I kept my face down in the dry liquid, my breath held unto severe pain.  Come on, come on haze began to descend over my thoughts, and I felt my awareness shrink.

At the very last, I shot up, gasped in blessed air, and took off running. The ruby cubes were still on the horizon, but the one that had come to investigate us had somehow taken the sapphire weapon I'd thrown down in my diving haste. If the rifle hadn't jammed if I hadn't discarded it I shuddered to think what might have happened.

The Preacher rose as I hit the trees - and, as I'd both hoped and dreaded, it began pursuing me.

**Threaten the messenger of the Word? Ye shall suffer.** The fear was gone from its mental voice, and whatever momentary bond of danger we'd had was gone. I had no doubt it was going to try to kill me.

I had to think, I had to think I had to think but I couldn't focus. What world was I in? I wasn't sure. My run took me down steep slopes, right into an abandoned suburb. What tools did I have? I had my regular assault rifle, but it would do little against a creature like that. I had the amethyst suicide device, but I wasn't about to resort to that just yet.

Running through the flooded streets, I stretched my hand painfully. The burns from the First World's white hole were still healing, but I needed delicate precision. It took me a precious two minutes, but I managed to hotwire a car. I lucked out, in that it still had some gas, and I drove off as the Preacher burst between the houses and sighted me.

It could sense my mental presence. That much I knew. I would never be able to hide from it. I couldn't simply drive away, either, or it would tire of chasing me and escape forever. No, I had to find some way to fight it then and there.

There wasn't much time to think, because a large garbage truck appeared behind me in the gloomy rain. The Preacher had contorted itself in and around the driver's cabin; some mockery of the human form sat within, connected to the twisted blob of flesh all around - and it was actually driving after me.

"Bullshit!" I shouted - but I had no squadmates to hear me. Not this time. A soldier wasn't supposed to go on missions alone, and a sudden chill beset my heart. Nobody was going to bail me out of this one, so I drove faster and harder than I should have through the storm. Random abandoned cars appeared before me, and I swerved around each at the last moment.

The Preacher smashed through them with its enormous truck. It had no words for me now. It now knew I would not be swayed, and it now knew I would hunt it forever. In return, it could never let me escape. In a way, a true duel had commenced, and it would continue until one of us died.

I needed a new tactic.

Holding the wheel with one hand while I raced down an open patch of road, I brought my conventional rifle out and tried to aim it with one hand. A spray was all I needed, really, so I fired, even knowing the inevitable kickback would tear it from my grip. The gun fell away, its job done: one of the garbage truck's tires popped.

The truck swerved, hit another car, and toppled over, flattening a good third of the Preacher's mass.

Watching in the rearview mirror as I sped away, I saw it limp out and reform itself - smaller this time. Now, it was about twice the height of a car. Would it be slower as well?

I had to use that time to slowly swerve my way through a graveyard of abandoned cars on the highway. It wasn't ideal, but it was still faster than moving on foot.

Driving a new vehicle, it found me again half an hour later.

On the open road now, we simply drove. If it sped up, I sped up. If I slowed down, it slowed down. The gas in our respective vehicles would eventually decide our fates. Throughout the long drive, the sloshing flood outside deepened to nearly a foot, slowing us both equally. The only thing I could think to do was to keep broadcasting random requests for help on my hand-held radio. For hours, I sent out signals explaining my situation, and explaining the pursuing creature that could bring a fate worse than death, but no response came.

I was the one to run out of gas first. As my car sputtered and began to slow of its own accord, I gripped the amethyst pyramid in my pocket.

We'd come to the outskirts of a new city, with another abandoned suburb. I ditched the car and ran; the Preacher slid from its vehicle and skittered after me. By then, my wounds had mostly sealed up, but the running re-opened them, and I began tiring from bleeding again.

I fell against the hood of a green sedan, dark compressed space roiling all around my legs. Well, this was it. I watched the Preacher approach like a hungry spider about to leap onto its prey - actually, that was exactly what it was.

My radio crackled to life, bringing the fuzzy sound of laughter.

I pulled it up to my mouth. "*Hello?!*"

"I did it, I did it!" a male voice laughed, his tone manic and crazy. "Fate worse than death, fate worse than death, I let it go, because I was supposed to, and I can broadcast out now!"

"What? Who is this?" I demanded, staring at the approaching Preacher. It reared up higher as it galloped toward me. I could see individual corpses silently screaming at me in warning. Was my daughter among them? I couldn't be sure.

A familiar - and very welcome - voice cut in. Heath spoke over my radio. "Conn? Where the hell are you communicating from? This should be an extremely secure channel."

I didn't understand, but I knew I didn't need to. The gloomy rain fell away as a dozen new Suns appeared on every horizon around us. "Oh, shit, Heath, it is good to hear your voice," I said, laughing with the third voice on our channel. 

The Preacher slowed to a halt, looking around with its myriad eyes at the sky-searing walls of flame sliding in from every direction.

Someone had just nuked the entire planet.

Somewhere, someone had finally lost it - someone in control of nuclear weapons. The bombs went off all around, not even fired at anything; simply exploding where they were.

I had time for one last radio message. "Heath, tell Cristina it's done. She'll understand." Following that, I laughed loudly and happily for as long as I could. The radio cut out from interference soon after.

The Preacher reared up as that blazing brightness intensified. **Do not laugh! The distance is too great for instant death. Ye shall die with the messenger, in the greatest pain!**

"Nah," I told it, squeezing that amethyst pyramid as the ground began shaking to an incredible degree. Laura was safe now, and I had no desire to waste away from radiation burns. I'd already had enough of that with just my boiled hand. I shrugged, wiped away a tear, and smiled. "Have fun!"

With a simple press, I left the Preacher alone in a world on fire. It would not suffer a fate worse than death, as it deserved but close enough.

	<TEXT> It takes a particular kind of person to do maintenance well. There's no love for those who invisibly keep things from going wrong. The work is boring, but you can't let your mind wander. Your tasks are repetitive, but you have to do them right every single time. A maintenance man who loses track of himself is a maintenance man putting everyone he works with in danger. Lives do depend on us, and the greatest workplace tragedies often come from the smallest missed detail.

More than all that, the best maintenance men actually take a good look at machines that *aren't* broken on a regular basis. That was how I noticed the problem before anyone else.

I was on my morning evaluation when I found the first anomaly. The factory was just starting to wake; sleepy or hungover workers were still wandering in to begin prepping the machines. The boss, of course, wouldn't show up for another hour or two. We should have been resentful, but it was actually the most fun part of the day.

Like most mornings, Boyd had his volleyball out, and I gave a pleasant grimace as it went sailing over my head. I'd recommended a lighter ball, perhaps the inflatable beach kind, but they hadn't listened. Hunt spiked it back, and I tried not to tense up. The machines were sturdy, but there was a small but non-zero chance that the ball could take a freak trajectory and damage something.

I hated small but non-zero chances. They were the bane of my work. Anything that could go wrong eventually would

When I got to the industrial air conditioning unit on the roof, I was already a little on edge knowing that those guys were still playing with that volleyball downstairs - but I didn't miss the very small detail that was out of place.

The massive air conditioning unit had a small gouge near one of its edges. Standing on my toes to examine it closely, I tried to figure out what might have caused it. The metal showed no signs of stress. There were no nearby scratches. There was just a roughly hemispherical piece missing from the chrome frame. It didn't match any problem I could think of.

It was very small, and anyone else might have dismissed it, but I didn't like unexplained happenings. The little hole had exposed some of the wiring, and there was an extremely small chance that a spark might pop out at some point. It would only land on concrete, but I didn't like to take chances.

Looking around, I studied the roof's hot, wide, and dull concrete landscape. There were a variety of climate control mechanisms up there, but none of them could normally cause any damage like that. At first, I guessed that some kid had shot a beebee gun or something, even though the lack of scratches and metal stress made that unlikely. Taking a sweaty little walk across the concrete under the burning morning sun, I searched the surroundings below.

The factory parking lot and shipping areas were locked and sealed at night. It was unlikely that anything had come from that direction. The other side of the building faced thick Virginia forest. There hadn't been a need to clear it, so they'd left the ancient pines standing. It was that tangled canopy that I studied at length. Could kids have snuck up through the woods?

Despite the growing summer heat at that phase of the morning, I shivered. No matter how bright and stinking hot it was up here, the treetops right in front of me would always cover the land beneath in shadow. Worse, there *was* a vector from within the trees to the ding in the air unit had something? I shook my head, shrugged off the odd fear, and returned inside to log the damage in my reports.

I spent much of the rest of that day keeping my hands busy while I thought about the unexplained damage and the quiet and unhappy forest right out back of our industrial stone palace. On the way out, I heard a slight rumble in the engine of Hunt's truck, but I was too absorbed to mention it to him - and it wasn't strictly company business, anyway.

Television and beer kept me occupied that night. Two beers, one episode of *Gilligan's Island*, and nothing from work could bother me.

But the next day, as the sun rose over the treetops and lit that concrete landscape again, I found two more little holes in the air conditioning unit. A slight bit had also been sliced out of a nearby duct, as if by some sharp phantom fingernail.

I headed down into the factory to log the strange damages - just in time to see Boyd's volleyball bounce at an unexpected angle. The ricochet took it into an access opening barely bigger than the ball itself, and I heard something creak and bend.

The guys all shouted with worry and concern while I opened a side hatch and found that they'd damaged the alignment of certain delicate parts. They all begged me not to log the damage, but I had to; they pleaded with me not to report how it had happened, and I had to relent. There would be nothing to gain in telling the boss about their morning volleyball ritual. Quietly stressed by the lie I was engaging in on my report, I replaced the damage parts with spares I'd convinced the boss to order for exactly this potential problem.

Well, not damage by volleyball, but the parts were crucial to the factory's operation. The expense had apparently been worth it.

As I was cataloguing the removed parts, I stopped and stared down at one of them. The smooth metal had a small hemispherical ding missing from its upper curve.

Alright. That officially meant something was very wrong.

Logging an official shift in my daily duties, I began going over everything metal in the enormous building inch by inch. Two or three hours in, I'd found no further dings, and I was about ready to head to lunch - until I saw a similar little hole in the back brick wall.

It wasn't just happening to metal.

What could do something like this to random brick and metal without any common vectors?

Before I could think further, the boss came around. I first felt his presence as he stood tall and disapproving behind me. "What's goin on'? Expensive part this morning, and now you're staring at the wall?"

I tried to show him the bits of damage I'd found, but he shrugged the evidence off.

"I understand you're havin' a tough time," he said, suppressing his own annoyance for a moment. "But please get back to work." He began to step away, but hesitated. "Or take time off, forgodsake. One or the other. Friggin' unnatural that you're here, considering."

If that was the way he wanted it, I resolved to let the issue go and grow. I stopped pursuing the unknown cause, but I logged every single ding as they began to show up in more and more places. Eventually, the guys started noticing. Hunt's engine crapped out after work one day, and he opened up the hood to find missing little bits from most of the plastic and metal parts.

Whatever could go wrong eventually would. I'd told them.

On an otherwise typical Friday, there was a commotion around lunch time. Boyd's coffee cup - nothing fancy like Starbucks, just the local place - had sprung a leak mid-drink. A little circle was missing from the foam, exactly in the shape of the dings we'd been finding.

"Nobody was around," I heard him tell the others. "I was just standing there, talking to Weaver, and then *fft* and coffee was splurtin' everywhere."

The boss came out of his high office to talk to the men, and I took a surly walk around the premises while he was distracted. I was pissed off enough to head out into that shadowed forest, and I moved along the edge of the building until it turned against the tall trees. There was a thick blanket of leaves back there, and the trees were far enough apart to walk between without much trouble.

It was *right there.* If anybody had bothered to go out back, they'd have seen it immediately. They might have thought it was something bugs had done to the leaves, but I knew better now.

[It was exactly what had been done to brick, metal, plastic, and cardboard](http://i.imgur.com/b5YbSZm.jpg), only much more widespread. The leaves had all been dinged through and through, leaving the trees in tatters.

That meant it could happen to living stuff. Anxious as hell, I ran back around to the front, wondering if the thick walls of the factory had been protecting us from whatever this was. Could it hurt us? Would a chunk suddenly go missing from *me* if I played around back there too long?

In a scared frenzy, I went to the boss, and even dared to show him the back. I could see it on his face. I *knew* he believed me - but he said otherwise.

"This is natural. Little critters do this every summer. We can't shut the factory down. That'd cost the company millions, and me my job to boot. I think you should take some time off. Seriously. You got thirteen days' leave, why don't you take it?"

Just like that, he put me out instead of shutting the place down.

That first night, my usual two beers became four, and then six. I didn't exactly joke around with the guys, but I liked Boyd and Hunt well enough. What if a ding went missing from their heart while they were working the lines? Or their brain? Would they just be fine one moment, and dead the next? They both had kids

That first night, I wallowed in anger and fear, but I did nothing.

The weekend came, and I was less agitated knowing that nobody was in immediate danger, but Monday rolled around and brought it all right back. Nobody called or contacted me to ask if I was alright, but my thoughts were still with them.

That second night off work, my usual two beers became six again. This time, I did something.

The boss had forgotten to take my keys. I wasn't really fired, in any case, but I might be if they caught me on the premises at night.

It had to be done.

I spent a few hours going over every inch of the place by flashlight. The little holes in stuff had grown in number - I found them in many of the machines, in the walls, and even in food that had been left in the break room fridge. I also found a pile of damaged parts. I knew what the boss had ordered. It was less expensive to just keep getting parts - he'd simply been replacing the dinged pieces and ignoring the problem!

Balling up my courage, I crept out back.

This time, by flashlight, [I found something.](http://i.imgur.com/syTwfWb.jpg) Spiky, menacing, and alive, they were like burrs I'd seen before in forested areas, but they vibrated ever so slightly as my flashlight fell on them. As I watched, one shivered more deeply - and let off a spike with a silent shot.

The little dagger of organic matter flicked by me, and I ran to the wall, both to get away from the spiked things and to see if they'd been the cause of the damage. There was no sign of the spike, and no damage to the wall outside. On a hunch, I ran around to the front and headed through the darkened factory. Shining my flashlight on the painted brick, I found a spot exactly in line with the shot spike I'd seen. Nothing there I traced the vector further up.

There was a ding missing from the window to the upper office. My boss usually looked down on us from there, and he might have been hit if he'd been standing in his typical spot. I was glad nobody was around - but terrified that I'd been right.

The little shaking spiky things outside were ripping up the factory with their spikes - spikes that could somehow go right through walls. What determined what they hit? Why had some dinged the brick, and others metal, and this one glass? How was this possible?

And something else occurred to me. Running out back for one last experiment, I shined my flashlight very close to one.

It vanished.

I hadn't seen them during the day - bright light made them invisible somehow!

Too scared to stick around any longer, I ran for home and got out my wife's old laptop. Going through all of Google and Wikipedia and all the science fiction books I could look up, I tried to figure out what was going on. Morning was coming on outside by the time I met a nerdy type in a chat-room sort of thing.

"I assume you're pranking me," he wrote. "But if it *was* real, I'd think these things were out of phase. Life from another dimension or something, only half here. That would explain why their projectiles go through walls and only randomly interact with matter. From the sound of things, they're getting closer to being fully part of our world. "

"Is that bad?" I wrote back.

"I guess? Their spikes should stop going through walls then, making them less dangerous, but then we'll have a hostile invading plant species messing up the ecosystem. Oh, also, just before they fully phase in, they'll be super dangerous. Their spikes will probably start hitting people. You know, while they can still go through matter, but not fully anymore. Spikes lodging in your heart, lungs, whatever."

Ugh. That sounded disgusting, and it was exactly what I'd feared. The plan, as my anonymous friend and I worked out, was to wait for them to fully come into our world - and then burn them all.

In the meantime, I had to protect my community. I went to a payphone a few miles distant and called in a bomb threat with a smile on my face. Immediately after, I went home and raised a beer in cheers to my boss, who had lost any choice in the matter of shutting down the factory.

There was a small but non-zero chance that they would figure out who had called in the bomb threat, but I ignored my usual concerns and spent the next few days drinking and watching television in a depressed stupor. The only thing I did each day was call in a new bomb threat if I heard they were re-opening.

I didn't really have a way of knowing when the spiked snipers were going to be fully in our world, so I kept sneaking by at night. Every time, my whole body ran with electricity at the possibility that those little demon growths could fire off and I could die without warning. Still, I came around, and the night they stopped disappearing under my flashlight, I knew it was time.

I had access to industrial amounts of flammable liquids, so I methodically poured the foul-smelling stuff over about three square miles of infected forest. 

It was near two in the morning when a night security guard found me, match in hand. He smelled the flammables and approached, a concerned look on his wrinkled face. "Buddy, I've covered for you more times than I care to count, but I have to ask: what the hell are you doing?"

I'd never met him before. I asked him to clarify about covering for me.

"Well, you've been coming by at night all the time to get caught up on maintenance work. That you'd get fired if you didn't keep up. At least, that's what you said. Um, seems to me you're about to burn the place down."

Yeah, it was about that time I started questioning my own mental state. There was a forest full of weird spiky growths towering before me in the warm night air, and I'd just dumped flammable liquids all over miles of it. I wasn't sure whether to light my match - not like the old security guard could have stopped me - but you guys came, then, as you know. Traced me down for the bomb threats. Small but non-zero chances.

Which is why I'm giving you this statement. I think I've been terribly off since it happened. I know how it looks to you: man loses his wife, man has troubles at work, man goes back and sets the place on fire except I didn't. I'm sure I wasn't going to. I truly believe, still, that there are weird spike shooting growths out there, and that they need to be burned, but I think somebody else should look into and handle it. I can't trust myself.

What? What do you mean the place burned down the next day with *everyone inside?* Why did they still go into work!? Our boss must have - this can't be real. No, I didn't have any sort of delayed ignition device, why the hell would I -

Oh God I never fixed the exposed wires in the air unit on the roof a spark could have -



I think I'd like my lawyer now.

"It doesn't look good. We're heading back now -" I heard the sounds of the radio being roughly grabbed. Noah's voice cut in, his words deadly calm. "Danny, you have to stop sending people in. The fight is over."

The conversation had been public, and the techs, commanders, and concerned citizens cramping the war room burst out into a massive round of cheering. Heath had communicated his and Jonathan's success in reaching the Capital Temple, but we'd all been listening to reports of the Hunger shadows and the Mictlan facing off. It was a relief to know that our people had somehow survived.

I fell into my chair and rolled back a few inches. I'd been at the end of my rope trying to stay awake and on top of things for weeks, and the world had been turning to shit outside, and the neighborhood kids I'd been watching over still hadn't managed to find any trace of their parents. Worse, everyone I trusted had been disappearing one by one. Cristina, Conn, Alek, Larry the Yngtak, and Noah Two had all gone their own ways, and Noah One had headed off into the fight with a team of people from his home reality on a mission they'd assumed was one-way.

I'd been surrounded by familiar and determined faces, but I'd felt like the only one left. None of the techs or commanders knew me personally. They'd continued to respect my command position without truly understanding where I'd come from and why people might listen to me; and, to be honest, I'd been starting to doubt myself and wonder if we really had any chance at all.

I hadn't been able to admit it. I'd lost hope. But to hear that we'd won the day -

On the other end of the radio, Noah didn't join in our cheers. "Is Thomas there? You guys have to close the portal immediately."

The celebration continued, but I felt a little sick. "What? Why?"

"This pocket reality is contaminated with GLORWOC, and a number of other worlds must be as well."

A few times, Cristina and Heath had both mentioned that mysterious threat. I gripped the arms of my chair. "What? *How?*"

"A skinless, bleeding, and delirious person stumbled their way here and collapsed." He paused, silently feeling something out. "They just couldn't handle being alone and cold anymore, and their despair and confusion took them to us. Everything they stepped on or touched along the way has been contaminated."

Heath was listening, too. He and I had the same thought, but he was the one who spoke as the cheers began dying down. "Oh no - we forgot! I was so worried about Jonathan Cortin, I forgot some of the others out there on the border of the Shield!"

We'd had so many fires to put out every single day - we'd dropped the ball. Back when he'd still been around, Alek had warned us that this would happen. We'd been stretched too thin, compressed too close, and stressed to the point of breaking. Those pressures had finally come back to bite us in the ass. "How big is the problem?" I asked Noah. He'd seen it before. He would know.

"Nobody in this pocket reality can be allowed to leave. Even a single speck of GLORWOC will eventually destroy an entire world. You have to close the portal, and I'll have Jonathan use the main generator to seal us off. I think we're going to have to seal and eject a cone of realities along the Contaminator's trajectory, too."

Our crowded headquarters went deathly silent. All eyes turned to me. I hadn't realized that the main Shield generator could eject realities from our sphere, but I couldn't risk looking weak or scared. Convincing these people I had what it took to lead had been a tough job already. "Do it."

Many in the room began shouting at me all at once. Some wanted to know which realities were to be ejected, some were demanding their friends or loved ones be allowed to return from the fight, and some were just screaming and crying. Most of the techs sat at their computers, their faces grey.

I turned away. The next job was my personal task to handle.

The stairs up seemed to go on far longer than usual. Every step was an exhausted effort. I couldn't settle on what I was going to tell him.

Feeling floaty, I moved down the third floor hallway, hearing our neighborhood kids playing video games with Thomas. A number of them knew what was up outside, but none were talking about it. We'd all been protecting our own from the truth of the savagery out there.

I stopped at the doorway.

Still standing in the corner, Ward Shaw assessed and then ignored my entrance. 

The boys, girls, and teenagers all noticed my expression and paused the game.

Thomas' smile faded. "What's up, Danny?"

I couldn't lie anymore. That wasn't going to fly - not for this. "You need to close the portal."

"Okay," he replied, before focusing hard for a moment behind his glasses. "There, it's done." Some of the kids patted him on the back in thanks. "That was quick. Is everyone back now?"

"No," I told him, letting the word hang there.

He realized something was wrong. "Then why did I close it early?"

I moved into the room, finally, and sat on the arm of the couch alongside my friends and - hell, my family. We were forever bonded. There was no way I was letting any of these kids out of my sight ever again, and that meant sharing the truth with them. I knew they could handle it, too. We'd all been through nightmare after nightmare, and I had a feeling the worst was yet to come. "They're contaminated with something. They can't ever come back."

One of the girls spoke up. "Are they gonna die?"

"I don't know. I just know that they can't come back here."

Thomas stood and drifted toward the draped windows with suspicion. Moving the heavy curtains apart, he revealed the black clouds, crazy green lightning, and scattered bubbles of glowing lava outside. "*When did it get this bad?*"

I fought back a lump in my throat. "We'll talk about it later, once this all gets sorted out."

He turned around and stared at me. "Aren't my people there? Aren't they in the Capital Temple with the bad guys?"

I hadn't thought about that - but I still couldn't lie to him. "Yes. But the Black-eyed Army has been defeated, more or less. Maybe your people will help save everyone there."

That brought nervous smiles and agreement from the group.

Before they could ask me anything further, I made a polite excuse and turned away. I got halfway down the hallway before a new thought brought me up short.

Looking back in the door briefly, I gave a little head jerk. Ward Shaw took the hint and followed me out. It always made me feel weird and small to be near him, but I had questions. "Cristina, I know you've been watching over us. We need your help."

"What is it?" Ward asked, his deep voice speaking for both himself and the woman who held control over him. "What are they contaminated with?"

I looked up at his concerned eyes. "GLORWOC."

His expression darkened even before he had a chance to convey the message. He, too, knew how much trouble had found us. "Cristina can't get back right now, but she says you have to be strong for this. It's good that you've closed the portal, but you also need to isolate anyone who came back recently. Use incandescent lights to expose any trace of glowing blue. You have to be *thorough.* Shoes, underwear, socks, in their hair, under their nails - check everywhere. Any person who has traces on them has to be sent through a portal to somewhere you can seal off permanently. If you find traces on the ground, you have to shovel the surrounding dirt carefully through a portal, and then throw the shovel in for good measure. Absolutely nothing can remain. What's the plan for the contamination out there?"

I listened, my heart pounding. "Heath and Jonathan are going to eject a bunch of realities from the Shield's protection."

Ward looked away, calculating. "With the full force of the Fist out there, those realities will be destroyed almost instantly." He closed his eyes in brief memorial. "Ideal destinations for those contaminated by GLORWOC."

Had that been Ward's comment, or Cristina's? I still hadn't been able to truly process the fact that our protector, teacher, and guardian was some unknown mix of angel and demon. I'd once asked Conn to kill the huge man before me because I'd thought the Sword was distantly responsible for the Crushing Fist and the related disappearance of our parents - but Ward Shaw had never been the Sword. It had always been Cristina.

I knew she wasn't responsible for the Crushing Fist, but that hatred hadn't just gone away. There was still something very wrong with her people and the way we'd all been living. The First World had lorded over us in lightly kept secret, creating a culture of elected robber barons and economic warlords among those wealthy people in the know. Each fringe reality had become like a little kingdom under provincial nobles.

*Our* world, *our* neighborhood, and *our* parents had suffered incredibly from that economic depression and inequality, and those billionaires responsible had been products of First World culture, either directly or indirectly. They'd had farm realities here capable of feeding *everyone* the entire time, and the technology to heal, regenerate, and extend life, and yet our parents had all been living in extreme debt and working multiple jobs to survive. I didn't know if they'd kept it all to themselves out of selfishness or apathy, and I wasn't even sure which was worse.

Cristina wasn't the one who'd done all that - and she'd told me before she'd been exiled from here that she'd never approved of that culture, and purposely left it - but I couldn't help feeling latent anger tainting my bond with her whenever I thought about it. She'd just shown up on the porch of an empty house in our neighborhood one day, and all of our lives had changed forever.

It was what she did. It was who she was. Just like the First Worlders, she made decisions - and everyone else had to live with the consequences.

I faced her down through Ward Shaw's eyes. "Cristina, what are you doing right now? You're doing something huge all on your own again, aren't you?"

"No," he said for her, but his expression betrayed the opposite.

A pained little sob escaped my chest. I hadn't even realized I'd been about to crack.

He sighed, and his bearded face softened. "She says she can't tell you because you need to be able to plausibly deny knowing about it if anything goes wrong." One giant hand reached out and clasped my shoulder. "From me and from her, you can do this."

Not knowing what to say, I just froze in surprise. I hadn't realized he could independently feel things.

"Your job is not to stop the Crushing Fist," he said, his tone calm and quiet. "You're surrounded by an army of talented people who will make that happen, if it's at all possible. No, your job is to protect the people here for as long as you can. There are no kings, politicians, or generals left, and nobody would trust them even if there were. That's why the people here listen to you: you're just some smart and brave young man. You don't care about money or power, and they can see that. That's why it has to be you." His heavy eyes grew distant. "You remind me of my brother, when he was young."

"You had a brother?" I asked, realizing he had an entire life I wasn't aware of at all.

"Yes. He could have done anything with his life. You can, too. Go down to the war room. Get with Heath. Figure something out to make the GLORWOC situation less of a tragedy. A single small hope can outweigh the largest loss."

Filled with his gift of calm, I nodded a few times, took a deep breath, and turned to head back down to the first floor.

"But be prepared," he called after me. "You cannot truce with GLORWOC. You cannot reason with it. It has no mind or morality. It blindly consumes, and nothing more. If you have to kill or lock away the contaminated to keep the human race safe, do it without hesitation."

His words hurt, but I knew he was right.

The shouting and chaos in the war room had stopped in my absence. All eyes were on me as I returned to the first floor. Above those worried expressions, the large monitor on the back wall quietly blinked with a storm of warnings. It had been a smooth sphere of green and amber realities, but it was now a misshapen blob of red errors, alarms, and danger.

I needed to take stock. "Heath, can you still communicate with Jonathan at the Capital Temple?"

"Yes. Now that I've gotten into the system there, I've set up communications back - and, right now, there are enough cracks in the pocket reality's walls to reach it if the primary connection fails."

"Will that change when you two seal it off?"

"Yes. We'll have to rely on the primary connection in that case. If it goes, that's it."

I moved a little further into the room, still highly aware of all the eyes tracking me and the ears listening. "What's the situation there right now?"

"Not good. The Mictlan has a contaminated leg, and is thrashing about and causing earthquakes. The shadow creatures sent some sort of physical portion of themselves into the fight, and that's contaminated now, too. They can't seem to withdraw without taking the problem back with them. We've also got millions of contaminated semi-invisible corpse-things wandering about, and a similar number of terrified, injured, and angry people. GLORWOC is spreading."

"Where's Noah?"

"I've lost contact."

I tried not to look nervous. "Is there any way to save the Capital Temple? The main Shield generator?"

He paused before giving the bad news. "No."

A palpable unhappy despair sank over the room.

I tried to stand a little taller. "How long until GLORWOC compromises the generator?"

"Unknown - but it *will* happen."

Had we just lost the war? I struggled not to let the realization show on my face. Ward had told me to assume someone else would save the day, and Cristina *was* out there somewhere my job, now, was to minimize the tragedy.

What had Cristina always told us? To pit one apocalypse against another?

"Heath - is there any fighting still going on?"

"No. There's no point now."

Now that was a strange thing to think about: the biggest powers in our little corner of the multiverse were all at a loss as to what to do.

For the first time in weeks, I was not.

"I have to go there," I said, looking around the room at my audience. Clamoring replies immediately erupted, but I held my hands up and spoke again. "This is an opportunity like none we could have ever imagined. This is our only chance to change what's about to happen."

I walked confidently toward the stairs, my heart pounding. Just out of sight, I began running. This was a terribly stupid idea, but I was the only one left, and doing nothing would only be letting us sink into darkness. "Thomas!"

He came into the hallway, the kids swarming up behind him. Many of them still had tear streaks on their faces, no doubt from talking about what was going on.

"Re-open the portal," I told him. "I'm not gonna let this happen."

That brought out the smiles. Among the relieved children, Thomas focused, and then nodded to indicate that it was done.

"Good!" I shouted, turning and running back the other way. I halted halfway to the stairs - and spun again, ran to them, hugged each young one and shook the hand of each old one. Nobody said goodbye, and I didn't hint that I might not be coming back.

By the time I returned to the war room, a thick knot of men and women had assembled to go with me. I didn't know any of them by name, but I'd seen each of their faces over the last few weeks. I didn't have any words for them, so I just gave a nod, grabbed a radio and some gear from the corner, and headed out into the stormy and heated day.

They followed; behind, beside, and around me. The rumbling ground and green lightning hurried us on, warning that time was short. As we dashed across the crumbling landscape, I noticed something new: there were dark patches in the sky. They were not clouds at all. They were more like splotches of dim roiling shadows, like somebody had pressed upon metaphorical ice and the water underneath was making darker spreading contact.

That was the first time I could see it directly. The Earth's internal pressure had risen, and lava had started bubbling out; the weather had gone insane, and the Sun had gotten dimmer; but those were all secondary effects. It was obvious that this was the pressure itself. Those spreading dark splotches were areas of space itself under immense pressure.

A little voice in my head screamed that we were all going to die soon, but I silenced it. I had a job to do.

The oval blue portal sat open among a huge crowd of people who had been told not to go in. Those on the other side couldn't get back, either - in closing and reopening the portal, the implicit chance for re-entry had been lost. Somehow, Thomas' portals remembered those who went through and allowed them to return, but that memory had been erased. I hadn't expected it, but I was happy for it. Anyone who did come through would have risked bringing us GLORWOC. But if we did find a way to save those people, it meant Thomas would have to go there in person and open a portal coming back the other direction.

I was never going to send the equivalent of my little brother on a mission like that. Not to a place where the slightest speck of contamination could kill you.

I kept those thoughts to myself as my knot of followers and I pushed into the portal and through the crowd on the other side. They separated hopefully, letting us pass - and avoiding contaminating us - but I had few words for them.

I'd seen and heard signals from the fight, but this was different. The starless sky, the giant golden beams, the ocean of blood at the base of the mountain, the titanic chrome spider large enough to form a sort of celestial dome overhead, and a pillar of chaotic black flesh on the horizon - I took it all in as best I could as we headed toward the Capital Temple at a rapid jog. Thankful for the training Cristina had taught us, and that I had continued in her absence, I set the pace. Every moment mattered.

Spectral blue glimmered like algae on the blood sea ahead, and we waded through the untainted areas with too much haste to choke on the vile smell. It was too much to really process, this waist-high blood oozing past my legs, and I was thankful for that. I might have passed out or screamed if I'd spared a moment to understand where it had all come from and what it truly was.

Once out of it, we did our best to wring the blood out of our clothes, but they remained crimson stained.

Nobody said a word for most of the run, as each of us had our own thoughts and fears to bear, but I was the first to finally speak once we neared the artificial caldera that held the Capital Temple doors. I raised my radio. "I need to speak to the leader of the Black-eyed Army."

It took several tries for them to finally respond. A woman's voice answered, one filled with shadows and animal anger. "*What?*"

"The situation has changed. I understand your pack mentality and your view of us, but your people and ours are allies now against a greater threat. Let us pass, and come with us into the Temple. Let's solve this."

I could see the last two hundred black-eyed soldiers in their trenches and foxholes outside the huge ornate doors. How had Jonathan ever gotten past these people?

No response came, but we couldn't wait. Thankful that I knew they were out of bullets, I led my knot of hard-eyed supporters across the no-man's-land between us and the former enemy.

They made no move to attack.

Coming close enough to lock eyes directly with the black-eyed soldier who had spoken, I nodded at her, and then proceeded straight toward the doors. From what I'd read in the book, they would respect a show of strength.

A tense moment almost had us all at odds, but I kept walking.

The two hundred surviving members of the Black-eyed Army began to follow.

The crazily ornate metal doors were bigger than I'd imagined. I tried not to feel dwarfed as I approached them, or as one of them swung open under mechanical power by Jonathan's or Heath's order.

A swath of surprised brown-clothed people sat just inside.

I gave them the same treatment. "The Black-eyed Army is with us now, and so are you. Come with us." Not giving them a chance to refuse, I led my growing line of followers straight down the tremendous hallway beyond. The brownshirts looked to one another, and then stood. I'd counted on them trusting me; after all, we'd rescued them from Teskoy and hosted them until they'd been abducted.

And, like the rest of us, they had nowhere else to go.

A bit down the hallway, I had our hundreds pause. There was somebody else who needed to be invited. "Shine a light back down the way we came."

The beams lit upon open darkness - revealing a knot of shambling corpse-things.

The others started to panic, but I shushed them. "You, Mictlan. You're with us, too. Come on."

The corpse-things shuffled forward, coming closer with their half-seen bloody hands and vacant eyes but they did not attack.

Secretly relieved, I turned and kept moving.

The tunnel beyond the doors was smooth sloping grey in an arc above us, and nothing more. It was perfectly straight, as if a tremendous laser had carved it long ago, and we followed it deeper into the mountain.

"I'd never thought I'd return here," a brownshirt male with long grey locks said aloud, his wonder apparent. "I never thought you humans would last this long, honestly."

The female black-eyed leader grunted. "They're stronger than they seem. And quite insane."

Next to me, a half-seen corpse-thing turned its head on its broken neck and gave a throaty noise of agreement.

I walked among them, still feigning confidence despite rushing anxiety and adrenaline that threatened to explode my heart at any moment. Would Cristina be proud of me? I'd seen the opportunity she'd trained me to see, and I'd walked right in at the perfect moment to get all these very different entities working together - at least for the moment. There was one wildcard still left to encounter, and I had absolutely no idea what motivations might be in play.

The tunnel terminated at a gigantic dome. Seeing the natural phosphorescent gold and white within, we turned our flashlights off.

The design was startlingly simple. Chrome carvings and patterns lined the walls, creating a strange church-like feel, but the only machine lay at the exact center. A number of miles-wide wide gold rings rotated in the floor, and a walkway allowed access above. There in the center, the direct focus of the dome, sat a holographic visual I recognized.

It was the Shield, and our realities - drawn in various wire-mesh reds.

Heath. He'd known. It had been inside him, somewhere deep. The images he'd designed had mirrored the controls to the main Shield generator itself.

A single figure stood at the consoles beneath that vast holographic blob.

"Jonathan!" I shouted, leading the way toward him.

Our hundreds travelled across the walkway, exchanging murmurs of awe.

There was enough space on the central platform to hold us all. Letting the rest mill about as they saw fit, I approached Jonathan alone. A camera mounted on his shoulder adjusted its angle of its own accord, and I nodded at it, knowing Heath was on the other end.

I stopped short as I looked up. One of Jonathan's eyes was black.

He lowered his head in slight apology for not having mentioned it. "You must be Danny. It's good to meet the man behind the voice."

Was he compromised by the wildcard? Or was this a fantastic opportunity? I stared at his pitch-black eye. "Jonathan, do you know what motivates the shadow creatures?"

His white eye and his black eye both scanned the mixed crowd with surprise before he responded. "Yes - Hunger, for all living experiences both pleasurable and painful. They take people apart and put them back together again; they activate all your memories, and then eat them; they consume every single aspect of your existence just to experience it themselves. Sometimes they kill you just to feel it, and sometimes they let you live just to feel that, too. They delight in pleasuring and torturing, and they have absolutely no remorse or compassion."

I blinked as I thought about it. It made sense inside our Shield, we were like a ripe apple begging to be bitten. There were a trillion living beings inside, all with lifetimes of memories and experiences to consume -

"That's not entirely true," Heath interrupted, speaking from my radio. "One of them once showed me compassion because I was - because I am - *vwaal.* It said it was experiencing pity for my situation."

That was better than I could have hoped for. "So they're not mindless? They *can* be reasoned with?"

"Deals can be made with them," Heath responded, and I thought I heard a note of sadness in his words - but I didn't have time to ask about it.

"Good," I said, my hope rising. "Do either of you know how to contact them? We need one of them here."

Jonathan clenched his fists, and a black vein in his neck bulged with anger. "*Those fucking things -*"

Heath cut him off. "One's here with me. It's already heard your request. It's coming - now."

Confused and surprised, I turned to the hundreds behind me. "Brownshirts - guys - can you make sure our guest doesn't eat any of us?"

Several of the brownshirts let their eyes go unfocused for a moment. After feeling the approach of our final guest, they nodded. The white-haired male that had spoken earlier narrowed his eyes. "I'd be wary of those ones. As we are unlike you, they are unlike us. They're not individuals the way you and I understand. They simply operate as independent representations of Hunger itself. Servants, utterly."

I took his warning to heart, and added another layer of concern to the tension growing in my chest.

The whisper came from every direction at once - and none at all.

*You've made your point. Deactivate your contamination,* **fivhen.**

Our gathered folk quieted. Eyes turned on the open white and gold dome above, but there was nothing to be seen.

"Our contamination?" I said loudly. I had no doubt it could hear me, but everyone present had to hear as well. "We don't control it. None of us do. Alone, we're all doomed."

*Fear ever experienced by proxy fear not desired firsthand. What is your intention here?*

This was my shot, if there really was one. "Alliance!"

*Alliance? With such vermin?*

Jonathan raised a pointed finger. "Vermin that can hold you off for -"

I silenced him with a brutal cutting motion. "Look around," I countered. "The Mictlan, the brownshirts, human beings, and a fusion of you and us - these are not vermin. These are your companions in existence here. This is your community. Welcome to the neighborhood."

Dark chilly tendrils poked around my mind, and I shuddered - but the brownshirts moved closer.

*I am not consuming you. I am examining you.*

That didn't help me relax. I waited for several heartbeats as it probed my sincerity.

Satisfied that this wasn't a trick, it continued. *What is the plan, then, little one? Impress us.*

The words came to me as if from some inner inspiration. "GLORWOC consumes like you do, but it is opposite you. It has no hunger, and it enjoys nothing. It is blind, and mindless, and will spread forever if we let it. Are you blind and mindless?"

A hiss followed. *Insults?*

"No!" I shouted. "What's your plan if you truly get through the Shield? To consume all of us? Think about what happens when that amazing feast is over - these worlds will be lifeless and empty. You know what comes after that?"

No response came. The shadow creature simply waited.

I gave it what I guessed was its ultimate fear. "Boredom."

*NO!*

"Yes!" I screamed, whirling around to face a chillier portion of the cave air behind me. "Boredom for all eternity, with nothing to experience, nobody to consume, and nobody to play with!"

Jonathan grunted.

"Or," I continued. "*Or,* you could let us live and we could feed you new experiences on an ongoing basis for as long as we exist as a species."

A pause followed, but the subsequent sibilant whisper actually sounded interested. *How?*

"We" I looked at those gathered around, desperate for an idea. I had one, but it sounded insane "We could allow you to have our minds as we die. From what I know of you, you eat experiences, right? But the Black-eyed Army still has their souls, since I read one's story"

*Souls,* it hissed with humor. *Pitiful, tiny, solid things. Inedible.*

"Yes!" I shot back immediately. "You can have our experiences and memories when we die. We don't even need them anymore! And there will be a trillion of us being born and dying all the time, so you'll have fresh experiences every single hour of every single day for as long as we are allies."

A rather intact corpse-thing shambled forward, and a moan escaped its lips. "I have no use for mind or soul. I cast both out of the shells." It turned its empty eyes on me. "I want the bodies."

I stepped back, stunned. "Or?"

"Or hostilities continue," the Mictlan stated, without malice. "Alliance requires give and take."

I looked to those with me, and they looked disgusted - but amenable. "Alright. We don't need our bodies when we die, either. The Mictlan gets our bodies, the logistics of which we'll figure out later. The Hunger gets our minds? Yes?"

*Fine,* it sighed, sounding remarkably even-toned. *Anything to avoid the Great Reaver...* **boredom.**

"What about us?" the leader of the black-eyed soldiers asked.

That one was easy. "You can come home, or you can go where you wish. Run our borders and fight threats from beyond, or live within. You are us, and we are you."

She gave an animalistic bow and retreated.

The white-haired brownshirt raised a hand. "That leaves us."

"Will you stay?" I asked. "I know you're on the run, and looking for a home. I offer you the chance to build it here, with us. Protect us from threats like the Hunger shadows -"

A hiss followed.

"I said *like* the Hunger shadows - protect us from threats *like* them, and we'll protect you in the physical plane. No more running. We already love one of you, and I think we could grow to love the rest."

He raised one corner of his lip to form an impressed smile. "We believe you, because of your care for Thomas, and I think I speak for all of us when I say: yes."

The Mictlan eyeing me spoke up. "Then the alliance is sealed, which I assume precludes transgressions between members." It looked to the dim shadow hanging in the air. "We have already seen such conflicts are damaging to both sides."

*Agreed. Now what about GLORWOC?*

"That's where we come in," I said, just trying not to pass out from hope and fear and anxiety and triumph. The worst was about to come. "We're going to perform history's biggest amputations on one another - those realities inside the Shield that are contaminated, all of us human beings here that are tainted, the infected shadow flesh, and the Mictlan's leg."

A moment of silent understanding followed. There were none here that had not, or would not, lose a great deal. The Black-eyed Army had lost thousands, the brownshirts were the last of their race, the worlds of humanity were going to lose a tremendous amount of space and people, the Mictlan was going to have to have one of its colossal legs melted away, and the Hunger was going to have to have part of itself get cut off the way it had sliced up others.

But moving forward was possible. The future was possible.

"Alright then," I said, wondering if we'd just saved the day. "Shadow creature, or Hunger, or whatever you want to be called - does this deal also include a stop to the pressure outside? Will you stop crushing us?"

*No,* it replied, sounding confused. *That's not us.*

"You're not causing the Crushing Fist?" I screamed, all my tension from the negotiations erupting at once. I'd just assumed that the monsters at the door had had something to do with the unknown siege.

*No it is very rare for us to engage in physical presence. It is too risky, as you can see through our current situation.*

"**You're not the Crushing Fist?**" I shouted even louder. "**Then what is it!?**"

*We don't know none of the organisms we have consumed in or around the Great Barrier have known anything about it.*

That brought confused murmurs and fear among the would-be diplomats.

Heath interrupted, his tone alarmed. "Danny!"

His call came hand-in-hand with a sudden tremor in the rotating golden rings beneath our platform. Dust sifted down from the white and gold dome overhead.

"What's going on, Heath?" I clutched my chest, wondering how this was about to get even worse.

A picture appeared on one of the consoles - a live feed from a camera somewhere near headquarters. Another picture appeared on a nearby console, showing another world. Three more streams showed up.

As I watched, the roiling dark patches I'd seen in the sky began erupting one by one. Ethereal gloom spurted from them like cracks in an underwater dome; as each burst, more cracks appeared, and I had the sudden recollection of a movie I'd seen as a child - a crew had been trapped on a submarine that had been damaged by a torpedo, and the ocean had started blasting in through a thousand tiny little cracks. Despite my best efforts, I felt tears roll down my cheeks. "Heath, what is that?"

"It's the final collapse," he replied, sounding tearful himself as the mountain began shaking harder all around us. "It's happening - now!"

	<TEXT>  Is it cool to use characters from your stories? I'm really only asking about Heath. It'd be cool to see what else Heath is helping with aside from the main folks. I'm sure he has the... Multi-tasking power to do more than we've seen.

I believe Heath is ideal for this use, and I purposely characterized his interactions for this potential purpose. The other characters don't have any 'free time,' so to speak - they've all been doing very specific things . So I'd say generally no for the others, but absolutely yes for Heath.

There are a few interesting exceptions as long as the characters aren't used on a first-person basis. The Black-eyed Army was up to no good for five years, and I can see them being mysterious antagonists to normal people who have absolutely no idea what's going on. Noah Two also has a purposely obfuscated and foggy timeline because of the Black-eyed Army's abuse. They used his emotion-sensing abilities for specific objectives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can see a little discussion about this [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/3djx9r/new_rm59gar_subreddit_rules_check_out_this_post/ct6vraf)

If you want to submit a story or stories, I think people here would enjoy that.

You would still own all the rights (I have no claim to it just because it's in my subreddit or anything like that).

The guidelines (written some time ago) are:

 So, this is definitely experimental, but I think we could do something great here. What I've got in mind is a group of different stories, written by different authors, that all fall under a common theme.

 Theme: something bad is happening in the realities in which human beings live, and the individual storytellers are largely on their own.

 Factors:

 - There is no shadow organization or functioning military aware of the situation (too cliche :) ). There's no 'help coming' and nobody to tell. Governments won't believe the individuals in our stories, or won't want to believe for their own reasons.

 - There are dozens of human realities that contain a total 947 billion people. We all exist in a sphere of realities that were protected before, but are no longer. This protection faded over the last few years, and now all sorts of terrible things from the multiverse are seeping in. Of course, none of our characters will really know this. 

 - The events of a story can involve almost anything, including much higher stakes than normal NoSleep stories. The world can be at stake if done right, because we're all not necessarily in the same realities - one guy's Earth could be destroyed, while the rest are fine. I think this is the main selling point of this project. We can write NoSleep stories that are above and beyond the normal limits because of the concepts they're couched in. **[7/20/15]: this didn't end up working out ;p**

 - The threat in a story can be almost anything as well. Whatever you can think of probably exists somewhere, so it can come here and cause problems. I've got an extensive regional map I work from, but there are plenty of purposeful unknowns. **[7/20/15]: spoilers!** I can tell you, most importantly, there are a few nearby political allies and enemies, and a few regions of lifeforms that are so different from us that we can't even establish communication. Notable ones being the Gemstone Hegemony - a vast region of Earths populated by varying crystalline lifeforms - and a spectrum of Earths conquered by a very egotistical planet-sized plant that has bred all sorts of biological plant-based nightmares as toys, weapons, and servants.

 - The style can be uniquely your own as well, since we are different people telling different stories.

 - These events were set up by my Portal in the Forest series http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2m4i88/the_portal_in_the_forest/  and my Desolate Guardians series up to part 5  http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2qej4k/judging_by_the_message_i_found_someone_somewhere/ , but you don't actually have to do anything with those elements if you don't want to. I do have a network manager character who is trapped in an office building, with access to the Internets of every human reality, who has seeded ideas everywhere to start people noticing what's happening. He is more than happy to use radio / email / video to contact characters, coordinate efforts, arrange help, and so on if you want. There is something more to his situation I can't get into yet without spoilers.

 For the title - whatever title you choose for a story, add [Humanity Under Siege] if it falls under this framework. That's a meta tag to let readers know what we're doing and what stories to look for. **[7/20/15]: these tags didn't ended up being approved**

I think it's perfectly fine if you write in different eras of the series. For example, a story about an encounter with a backwoods creature might take place around Portal in the Forest or The Desolate Guardians. It'd be weird if some guy was messing around in the woods of some normal reality during the events of Our Final Acts, when everything's going to hell.

If we get enough contributed stories, I have no problems putting out a free ebook (or even a physical copy) that credits everyone involved.

Have fun! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was hot enough to burn, and the air wasn't moving at all, but a thundercloud was keeping the patio shaded winter dark. On account of the strange feeling in the world, the customers out there weren't talking much. It was the kind of weather that my mom used to call ominous. She'd put up spare crosses to keep away bad spirits, and it made me and my brother feel better. We didn't have any relics at Cooper's, though, because Cooper always said bar-goers wouldn't like it. They didn't want to be reminded of religion while they were getting trashed and trying to get some.

Made sense, sure. I still wished I had some sort of comfort as I took my day's first roundabout through the building. Cooper's had been active in the twenties as a speakeasy, and had been expanded many times, 'til now it was a gigantic mess of a building. The trip to the bathrooms alone had newcomers confused. They'd go back from the bar area and find a little dining room. Back some more, and find a half-exposed patio. Back past that, and there's narrow steps down to a crappy basement drinking area. If they take a left past those stairs, they hit one of the building's exits - if they turn around, the bathroom doors are in the wall behind 'em, same color as the surrounding wood. They usually don't even know the doors are there unless someone else comes out.

And that was just half the first floor. The place had two basement levels, four floors, and a small fenced area on the roof. It was a mansion of a bar, and Cooper treated it that way. He was there getting drunk and giving away free drinks every single night. It was his own personal party every day of the week.

Us? We were just buzz kills at his party. Nobody wants to think about paying the help while the party's still on, but his party never ended, so he was always pissy and annoyed that he had to give money to these people in his mansion. There were random screaming fits, and lots of excuses to dock pay, but that stuff was still better than my last job. No, the thing that got me was his need to test us.

He'd leave some random mess somewhere in the mazy bar at the start of the day, and later he'd ask us if we did our roundabouts right. We'd say *yes, of course*, and he'd say *well then, let's check upstairs*, and we'd know we were boned right from the start. He'd make a big speech on the way up the steps about trusting us, and appreciating our help, and then *oh, what's this? I left this mess here to test you and it's not cleaned up I thought you said you did your roundabout right?*

And then it was half an hour of red-faced screaming while we stood in place with a dead expression. One frown, one tear, or one word would get you fired. We'd all seen it.

So I was hot-faced when I found it. I didn't say anything, because the quiet outside had snuck in somehow and kept everything in the building whispery and weird. I felt that Cooper would hear even the slightest mutter, so I just cleaned it up without a word.

 He didn't say anything that day, though. He didn't ask about my roundabout.

The weather was exactly the same the next day - a little hotter and quieter, if anything. Just really damn nervous weather. We took orders in hushed tones, and the customers spoke like they were in church during a sermon.

I found it again, in the same place. The fourth floor was smaller than the others; one big room, really, which topped the mansion, and it was usually only available for reserved events. A few too-small windows showed out onto dark grey skies, making me feel uncomfortably visible to the unhappy air out there, but the big room was otherwise usually pretty nice. There was nothing up there but brick walls, hardwood floors, a small bar in one corner, and a whole lot of tables and chairs.

The chairs were all upside down on the tables, like they were supposed to be, but somebody had built little houses out of the sugar packets in the middle of all that. I didn't know how the hell he'd done it the first time, and I sure didn't have any idea the second. To even get to the sugar packets, I had to carefully pull down a bunch of the chairs at each table, and putting the chairs back on would surely have knocked down the little structures. It was as impressive as it was strange, and the whole silent time I was fixing it, I felt like he was looking over my shoulder from somewhere.

But there was only a narrow grey-skied window behind me.

Just as I was done, something creaked somewhere, and I hurried out of there.

Weird thing was, Cooper didn't say anything about my roundabout that day, either. My next shift, it was still quiet and dark out, and painfully hot. That time, he finally questioned my rounds, and I told him I'd found his little trick a third time and decided not to fix it - not in so many words, of course.

He said he didn't know what I was talking about, so I took him up to the fourth floor. I'd seen the little sugar packet buildings not two hours before, but now the big room was totally different. Chairs had been stacked into big regular pillars in the middle of the room, and the tables were all on their sides in hexagon shapes.

Cooper was *pissed*, and he told me to clean it up or I wouldn't get paid for that day. I didn't know if that was legal, but I had no choice, really. Confused and angry, I spent an hour setting tables back and up-ending chairs right. Who had even been up here? I'd just been in there two or three hours before, and I hadn't seen anyone have enough time to do all that

Just as I put the last chair up on one of the tables and wiped sweat away from my forehead, I felt like somebody was watching me again. This time, I stared at the dark skies out one of the narrow windows, with the feeling that I would see somebody out there in the shifting clouds - somebody who was watching me from really far away. The longer I stared, the more creeping little needles climbed up my spine, and I eventually had to break and run downstairs.

When the fourth floor tables and chairs were rearranged again the next day, Cooper called me at home to bitch me out. All I could do was remind him that he'd seen me fix them and leave, and I hadn't been back since. That shifted his anger toward someone else, a *prankster* that he swore he was going to catch.

He only got angrier as it continued to happen every day for the next week. The patterns became more complex, and even the bottles from the corner bar up there started to get mixed in. At some point, we went up there in the morning to find a single stack of beer bottles from the floor to the ceiling - one bottle on top of another, perfectly cap to bottom from hardwood to paint. I touched it, and they all fell and smashed everywhere.

Cooper docked my pay double for each one.

For once, I shouted back at him, and he got really red-faced and talked low. He said that sure, he'd give me that money, if I sat outside that room with him the entire night to catch the prankster. Whatever - I agreed. I was invested, too. I couldn't figure out how the hell they were doing it.

It was the hottest night that month. It hadn't rained once in weeks, giving the air the consistency of sandpaper. I was mad, though, and I had a mission.

I set two chairs in a tiny room near the base of the stairs to the fourth floor. The idea was that we'd wait for creaking on the steps and then rush outside to catch the guy. It made sense. The steps were the only way up.

So, after finishing up all my closing tasks at around four in the morning, I turned off all the lights like usual and headed out the back - but then slipped around through the dark and let myself and Cooper in through one of the many side doors. We crept up to the second floor, down a couple hallways, took a right, and then used the old service ladder to get up to the third. Finally, we snuck into our little room near the base of the steps to the fourth and holed up.

Cooper had brought a six-pack of bottles, but he didn't share. He simply sat in the dark, drinking and fuming. Even though I couldn't see him, I knew how red-faced he must have been. It was how he always got, and I imagined he might beat this poor trickster kid to death if we actually caught him.

He was into his second beer when the night sounds of the mazy mansion bar began settling in.

A creak echoed from somewhere far away, and we both stiffened in our seats a little. But no, it was nothing.

A fan kicked on somewhere for a minute - what fan? What did it do? I'd never heard it before. It cycled off before I could really pinpoint it with my ears.

Like we'd been hearing all month, thunder rumbled outside. The shift in pressure that came with it creaked and swayed the building in a way that I would never have felt during the day. It was only now that I could feel it, with no other sense or noise or sight to get in the way.

The rolling thunder faded and a floorboard squeaked.

Cooper sat up tall in the dark, and I heard the slight clink of his beer being put down. Taking the hint, I stood with him, going slow to avoid making noise.

We both waited through another deep roll of trembling thunder, ears straining for any hint that someone was outside in the third floor hallway. I focused my hearing out there, going deeper and deeper into the silence. Every moment, the feeling that I was about to hear something horrible grew stronger, until -

An incredible ruckus erupted above us, and we heard wood slamming wood and tables sliding. It sounded like an explosion, or like a trained troop of soldiers had suddenly all taken action at once. Together, Cooper and I burst out of our hiding spot and ran up. He furiously kicked open the door.

All of the tables, chairs, and beer and liquor bottles had been arranged in scattered geometric patterns. There was no motion in the room; it had all been done almost instantly. That wasn't the part that shocked us, though: it was the fact that we could see it.

The narrow windows still showed out onto stormy grey skies. It was five in the morning, and still pitch black out but the windows were showing the same grey day-storms I'd been seeing all month long. That, and a light blue glow - the kind moss might give off in a cave - was just finishing fading as we scanned the room.

As the blue glow faded, so did the light from the windows, and darkness fell over us.

Cooper swore, more fearful than angry now, and we both hustled downstairs and out of the building. Once we were out in the parking lot, he swore a dozen more times, and held a hand to his forehead while he tried to think of what to do.

Haunted, he said. Shoulda known, he said. Shit, he said. He walked around, breathing hard and cussing and throwing out ideas. He could sell the place, but then he'd get sued if they found out he'd known about the haunting. He could try to get a priest or something, but he didn't want news to get out and scare customers away.

Finally, he turned to me, and he said he had it. Instead of coming into work, I would go to the library and research the place's past or something, do like an investigation, like in the movies.

I was not having it.

He said he'd dock my pay again.

I threatened to quit rather than deal with a goddamn ghost.

He stood a little taller, and then said he'd sue me for stealing things if I didn't do it.

I hadn't stolen anything!

But he and I both knew that didn't matter.

So, pissed as hell, I went to the library the next day instead of the bar. I had no idea what I was doing, but I knew in movies they always went and looked at old newspaper articles. So, I did that.

The place had a terrible history, but wasn't that going to be the case for a building over a hundred years old? Someone had gotten shot there during Prohibition. A guy had died there of a heart attack in the thirties. Someone else had fallen off the little roof area in the forties, before they'd had the fences up there. And there were a *lot* of cases of workers going missing after complaining about working conditions and managerial theft.

That last one concerned me. I'd always put up with Cooper's crap, but others hadn't. His family had owned the place since the beginning, and I'd heard stories of his grandfather's rather harsh take on his servants. His dad, too, had been a hardass I guess Cooper was just part of a family line of assholes who thought they owned you because you worked for them.

And what was I doing? Running around like his personal assistant for jack all. He didn't even pay me - the more I made in tips, the less the establishment had to pay me in wages by law. For the last two years, while we had a complete turnover in staff every three months, I'd stuck around. For that, I'd gotten a consistent paycheck of $0.00 twice a month.

And if the orders got messed up - if customers changed their minds, or if I got something wrong - it came out of my pay. I was basically paying this bastard to work at his bar! Meanwhile, he partied it up every night, acting like the world's biggest hero.

The more I thought about it, the angrier I got, and not just for me. A century of people like me had made the Cooper family rich it was no wonder his damn place was haunted. Somebody up there was clamoring for attention.

Even better, Cooper kept me on secret figuring-out-the-ghost-duty for the next few weeks. As the heat and quiet deepened into the flapjack's face-down side to Hell itself, everyone else sweated and cooked in their seats, but I kept inside and studied the fourth floor.

The pattern began to make sense. There was a timing to it, and a strong connection to the weather. The effect, too, was getting more elaborate. It was as if the murmur that had begun with sugar packets had now turned into shouting with splintered wood.

That last day, the tables themselves had been disassembled and carved into something new - shapes that vaguely resembled bones, with intricate random patterns carved upon them. I picked up one of the five-foot long carvings and stared at it for a good hour, trying to figure out what these tormented spirits were asking for. The walls were wet, and I realized that liquid from *inside* the still-sealed liquor bottles had been splattered into spirals, circles, and lines. Annoyed at what would end up being yet another dock in my pay, I moved the remaining tables, chairs, and bottles out of the room, and then spent two hours scrubbing the walls dry.

That last day, the weather had become oppressive to the point of torture. The air was thick and hard to breathe, and the sky was pitch black at noon. The thick thunderclouds that had been gathering for the entire summer sat overhead, glaring down angrily. People were scared, but in a muted kind of way they couldn't share. Attendance was up, but only so customers could drink themselves into oblivion.

And then the dishwashing machine broke.

Cooper came in and announced the staff would all be staying late to wash dishes by hand.

Unpaid, of course.

I heard this, and I pulled him aside. See, I didn't really think anything bad would happen, but I did want to scare some human decency into him. I knew the high upper room would be doing its thing in about two minutes, so I told him I'd solved the problem. In fact - and this bit of genius I made up on the spot - something else weird had started happening. The wooden tables and chairs, instead of being rearranged, had started turning into gold.

His eyes lit up something devilish, but he slapped me on the back and told me he'd give me a ten cent raise if it were true. For my hard work that summer, he said. And because, goddamnit, he just liked me as a person as long as I wasn't kidding him about this gold thing, of course.

Thanking him profusely, I walked him on up, smiled at him at the top of the fourth floor stairs, and then let him go first.

I closed the door behind him and hurried down to the kitchen to wait among my coworkers.

It didn't take long. Cooper's blood-curdling scream echoed out through his mazy mansion bar loud enough to be heard by customers and staff alike.

None of us moved.

At that moment, the two-months long build-up finally broke. A tremendous blast of thunder shook the building, and rain started blasting down with torrential force outside.

A long-time regular customer stood up, his eyes concerned and one of our bartenders finally started moving.

We followed our impromptu leader up the first flight of stairs, still hearing Cooper's screams sporadically through the rain and thunder. Silence fell halfway up the second flight, and we crept along the dim third floor with a sense of dread. I was worried, too, because I'd only meant to scare him - and those screams had been far deeper than just fear.

We stepped up the last set of stairs one creaking board at a time, and all hesitated outside the door. No sound came from inside, at least none that we could hear over the gusting rain. Thunder shook the building again, scaring us forward.

Our bartender leader took the handle, turned it, and swung it open as we all stared into a room lit by grey skies that floated gloomily past narrow windows. There was no sign of the storm through that glass, and the usual eerie blue glow was already fading - but we got a good look.

I should have expected it, really. I'd taken out all the carved wood and remaining chairs and tables. I'd even removed the bottles and liquor from the bar. The pattern was quite beautiful, in a way. It was the most complex yet, and it spanned the room in a dazzling display of hanging, dripping, and stacked geometry. The carven shapes had become extremely intricate, and the splatters on the walls had taken on a new level of artistry.

The materials were the only reason anyone started screaming; since I'd removed everything else, the only thing left in the room to be rearranged by the phenomenon had been Cooper himself.

	<TEXT> Whoops, I've given direct out of story references! I don't usually do that. But I guess since it's come up.

Yes, that's the entity in question, but it's a bit more than a cordyceps-type threat. Considers itself a god, as it said. There have been quite a few encounters with the 'edges' and castoffs of that region without direct confrontations with the plant god itself, for reasons and motivations none of us will likely get to see in these tales. Kind of like how the movie Independence Day was all about the Americans, even though there were a litany of other regions also facing danger. All depends on the people telling the stories :p </TEXT>

A great blaring horn shook the earth; the clarion call of apocalypse. We clutched our ears and screamed, hearing nothing but the single note of dirge that was somehow simultaneously mournful and empowering.

Despite the power of the Ink, something searingly cyan cut through the sky, like a searchlight from on high. All that we could see of it was a tremendous bright chrome surface, and colossal joints falling toward us.

I had a sense of what it was, and what would happen when it hit the ground. I had no words through that incredible blaring horn - instead, I pulled everyone along, and they kept their hands held as we ran out onto open bloody rock by the scant light of Jay's flashlight.

Weird twisty things with animal faces awaited us, but there was no will for a fight, not under the roving glare of that blinding cyan beam, nor under the intense vibration of that deafening call to arms. The servants of shadow were as dumbfounded and meek as we, and the lot of us fell and clutched the ground.

That move proved wise as eight godlike impacts crushed layers of mountain beneath unseen spiderlike chrome legs. Each gargantuan thud came as a kick to my entire body, and I felt similar pain ring out in the millions the shadows had only begun to torture.

The eighth and final impact faded, and the clarion call died. The celestial cyan beam shut off, and we were left in the meager bubble of a single fading flashlight. The weird animal shadows had no mind for us, instead looking around in visible fear.

And fear was appropriate, given just how powerful the Ink would make their enemies. In blocking out all light, the Ink had only sealed their fate.

I didn't know how or why, but I could sense it hovering above, like a Moon in the heavens of my mind: one mammoth mind, immeasurable in scope, and godlike in its refraction through millions of waking hollow minds. We'd provided it with an army of the dead. All over the field, those millions of bodies lying in blood or hanging from spires began to move.

The Mictlan had come to join the fight.

We pitiful humans - and one dream-stealer - clutched each other as invisible hands gripped the servants of shadow from every angle, ripping them to shreds without mercy. Black blood sprayed across us, but we made no move. There was no move for mortals to make in a fight between gods

A few shapes showed briefly in the direct beam of Jay's flashlight, but the invisible corpse-things moved on, pursuing the enemy.

With a whipping sensation, the Ink was gone from around us, and we watched it recede quickly back into its seed Spheres. The shadow creatures had realized their mistake, but their retraction was too late for this battle.

Chris laughed loudly at the void sky and golden beams above. "Are we actually gonna *live?*"

More than that, we watched as a new light joined the others: a very narrow bright beam began in the center of the aperture the Black-eyed Army had shut down. It was the beam being turned back on, which meant Jonathan had managed to deliver Heath and the Key program to the inner workings of the Capital Temple.

The other beams began spitting and churning less, and focusing more coherently.

A great cheer rose up across the mountain, both in spirit and physically. I let it wash through me, feeling at one with humanity in a new way. In risking myself, I'd joined them. Was that our power? Self-sacrifice? I -

Without warning, the cracked void above the newly regenerating beam exploded inward.

Turning as one to see this new threat, we stared in dismay as a miles-wide pillar of writhing and tangled black flesh broke through the wall of reality itself. It landed like the fist of a titan, crushing the end of one of the Mictlan's legs. A cyan beam shot out, slicing away a colossal portion of the black, but that planetary flesh responded by scattering into a horde of tortured notions.

A fight between gods the shadow creatures had sent in the heart of their existence, and we had no more left to give in defense. Only the Mictlan stood between us and them, and what then? If it won, would it simply leave us be?

Jay understood. "It's time for us to run. There's nothing more we can do here."

We stood as a group, intent on running for Thomas' portal while the heavens clashed above but we came up short.

It was frail, really. Hardly a person at all. The shadow and the spectre of Death. It stumbled forward, shivering. It had no idea what it was doing.

"I'm so cold" it whispered, but the Mictlan heard it. "Lundvik, is that you?" it whispered, but the shadows heard it.

We stared as the reviving golden light from above fell on spectral blue.

A trail of it had been left across the mountainous landscape, tracing back to the crack in space through which the gaunt, cold, delirious, and lonely figure had wandered.

Spectral blue glimmered on the bottom of the Mictlan's leg, and along the edges of that titanic fist of shadow existence and pain. Spectral blue glimmered in growing blooms all across the battlefield, spread by shifting pools of blood.

I'd seen it before. I knew what it was.

It was that third option that had been unforeseen. It was that fate worse than any of us - god, shadow, or mortal - had anticipated.

GLORWOC had come to us all.

Noah, you don't intend to do this alone, do you?

I stopped gathering equipment from the various crates in the cramped supply room. Heath's voice had come from the small radio device in my ear, and he would hear my reply from the small camera and mic attached to my shoulder gear. My default state was *alone and apart,* something which his unprompted advice had hit home in more ways than one. To be honest, I hadn't thought about it.

It was easier that way - being alone and apart. Remaining distant felt like isolating a variable in the madness of life, or gaining a more objective perspective. That was no longer possible, now, because the end of the world was nigh, and because I had a Human Intelligence watching from my shoulder. I would not be alone or apart until the crisis was over. Whether that would be through death or victory, I had no inkling, but it did strike me as subtly disappointing that I would have no more moments to myself until the end. There would be no time to process death. It would simply be upon me without warning, like a predator out of the dark

Speaking of moments with myself - another me was less intrusive than bringing anybody else. Heath, where's the other me?

Noah Two? he asked. Unknown. Nobody knows where he's been since his return to headquarters alongside the Sword.

That was odd - but I didn't have time to deal with it. I had to assume that Danny and the others were on top of it. Next up for recruitment had to be the most capable survivor in the multiverse. Cristina Thompson?

Heath gave a dismayed pause before replying. She's gone, too.

What? How? I asked, clicking my pack's single belt into place across my chest. She'd pissed off the Regret Demon something fierce, and been unable to go near any portals since she'd brought that strange entity out of the woodwork by devastating its home environs a second time - on purpose. Did she leave on foot, through cracks?

Must have.

I hadn't had a chance to meet her once she'd escaped the First World, but I'd certainly been privy to her tale. From what I'd heard of the woman, there would be no finding her. Alright who else? There was no time to waste. I began moving as we discussed alternatives.

My first stop was the third floor of our headquarters, where Danny was protecting our main advantage - Thomas, the boy whose presence made my brain feel weird and expansive. Danny sat playing videogames with him, doing his best to shield the young not-really-a-boy from the truth of what was happening outside. Ward Shaw, left behind to guard Thomas, stood at attention in the corner. I looked in briefly, but thought better of interrupting.

I'd been hoping to find Conn Thompson, for whom I held a curious trust - or even our other partner in crime, Larry, but I'd seen neither. If Cristina was gone, Conn would be with her. That much I knew for certain, but I could only guess that Larry must have gone with the rest of his scattered people on the Great Mourning. I doubted I would ever see another Yngtak.

Alek had stood apart, an outsider like myself and the H.I. watching from my shoulder, but Heath had reported him likely dead.

It occurred to me, on the way back down from the third floor, that a habit of trusting very few people led to there being very few people around to rely on. Of those hidden connections inside me, only a handful remained unaccounted for. Heath, can you find out where Jay and his crew are? I hesitated, but chose to also ask about certain friends from long ago on the off chance that they might have survived the past year.

I stopped on the stairs, momentarily clutching my forehead. I'd had the feeling before, but it was still uncomfortable. Somewhere, my duplicate, Noah Two, was under extreme stress. From experience, I knew I would wake up the next morning with vague new dream-like memories.

My remembered past was a confusing jumble because of our connection, but, in this case, if the morning additions happened, it would at least mean I'd survived the night. Today, surviving the night meant a great deal more than usual.

I stepped out into dark and scorching winds.

Angry black clouds roiled overhead, often sending streaks of sickly chartreuse lightning down to strike rising columns of ash. The campgrounds had morphed in recent days, becoming a littered plain empty of regular life. Instead of the sea of humanity I'd often lurked among, the flat terrain veritably brimmed with the simmering orange glows of molten effusions that had been pushed to the surface by the rising pressure on the planet. In other places and farm realities, people were being forced to constantly move away from the dangerous areas, packing themselves ever tighter; here, they'd emptied out voluntarily.

As I picked my way across the wounded and glowing earth, I studied the massive streams of people heading into Thomas' portal to join the horrific fight. They knew full well that the situation had long since grown beyond any opportunity for strategy, direction, or decisive victory. This was a march to slaughter, but a necessary sacrifice that few could refuse.

Heath had once told me that *the only defense we have against nightmare is the power of self-sacrifice.* I hadn't truly understood risking oneself for others until my personal purgatory alongside Jay and his men, but these people - these *normal human beings* - had somehow had it in them all along. There was a certain nobility in that hopelessness. They could each have run and hid until the last moment, dying like pathetic and frightened animals in a hole somewhere, but each man, woman, and child in those columns had chosen to leap forward and die early on the slim hope that others might survive because of it.

I saw their faces and manners as I grew closer. Their eyes were hard, but their heads were held high; they marched alongside the old, the young, the beautiful, and the ugly, but they moved as one; their expressions told of their resignation to death, but their feet took them ever forward unto strife. From what I'd heard read aloud above the remains of that member of the Black-eyed Army, the sheer desperate violence these people shared had become the most terrifying force in the multiverse. As I climbed between lava flows and watched those human beings stream willingly into battle under a boiling black sky, I believed it.

And it had drawn me in as well. I was human, too, and I was going to head into that portal with them. I could have asked them to send somebody else, but I knew that I was the only one who could navigate the chaotic storm of unknowable threats ahead. With any luck, I could sense them and avoid them. With any fortune, I would survive my run to the Mountain; to the Capital Temple.

After that well, death didn't seem to hold as much gravitas in the face of such limited alternative options. The forests, canyons, rivers, and houses of my youth were all gone now, or overrun, or crushed; there was nothing to go back to, and nothing to hope for. There was no great love in the future of someone set apart like myself, no eventual community that might do more than tolerate my orbit, and no city in which I would feel at home. I felt sometimes that I had always been meant for the role of witness, and nothing more.

But I could *care*. For some reason, that lesson and fact remained. I didn't understand how, but I treasured the ability nonetheless. My thread, so long displaced, might weave back into the tapestry. My thread might contribute to the countless others that were trying to keep our existence from unraveling.

The ground trembled. I leaned my hand against a displaced boulder with an odd line cut up through its middle. The touch strengthened something hanging about the area, and I studied the long, stained gulch that had been carved nearby, sensing the residue of terror. A great fear had erupted in this spot, only to be dispelled by a small but insistent beacon of resistance

A strained and familiar male voice interrupted my thoughts. I didn't believe him when he said it was you.

I turned to face the person I'd grown up with. He was now a man that bore only passing resemblance to the boy I'd known. Has it really been that long?

Chris gave a bitter frown as he noticed me sizing up his aging. Good to see you, too.

We both paused and swayed for a moment as the ground shifted beneath us.

It struck me sideways and subtle - this person meant something to me. For the first time in my life, I truly looked at him. His brown hair was not naturally curly, but had become rather messy thanks to campground living and the day's dark winds. His brown eyes watched me with hidden hurt from above hard cheeks. His face no longer held the softness of youth that I remembered. Had I changed in similar ways?

He turned his head away from my scrutiny. "Do you think the old neighborhood's still standing?"

I thought of that quiet suburb, many realities distant, under a shattered technicolor sky and many years distant, back into the past, when the world had been structured and sensible. "It could be," I told him, not altogether lying. "How's how'd your life end up going?"

He made as if to say something bitter, but then shook his head. "Have you heard anything from Caitlin? Is she alive?"

Another name that meant something to me. "I don't know. I'm sorry."

I faced the harsh gale to watch a few men approach. Their leader had shoulder-length hair that whipped rapidly in the wind, a sight which reminded me of the first time I'd met him.

Jay handed me a well-balanced section of lead pipe. "Best we can do. There are no more bullets to be had 'round here."

"Thank you," I said sincerely, taking the weapon. I recognized some of the dozen men behind him, and they nodded at me while holding their makeshift armaments at the ready. "Stick with me, and I'll keep us as safe as we can be up to the mountain. I have to be honest, though -" I raised my voice over a sudden gust. "I won't be calculating a path to get us there *and* back. Just getting there at all will be hard enough. We could easily make it to the facility and have no way out."

"We understand," a man on the right side of the group replied, and the rest nodded in fiery-eyed agreement. I looked to the speaker, recognizing him. It was Roger, and I had nothing specific to say to him, but I was glad to see him here. It was strange how people bonded through danger.

A rather forceful little quake nearly sent us to our knees. Holding the sliced boulder for balance, I agreed with Jay's pronouncement: "Probably time to go."

There were no more words. In shared grim and determined silence, we joined the thick flow of martyrs heading toward Thomas' portal. None acknowledged us. We said nothing of our mission. It was important that we didn't stand out.

Chris stayed close, and I stayed close to him, as we walked through shifting ethereal blue.

The blazing black winds pushed at us from behind, but the vast landscape opening up beyond greeted us with an entirely different environment. I'd seen amazing things, but nothing compared to that yawning gulf and its disparate elements.

First, I saw the thick lines of people flowing in, like arteries to a deadly heart. They were not just entering from our portal now, but also from cracks between realities that had opened elsewhere. From every direction, humanity streamed.

Ahead, that gigantic Mountain dominated the horizon, on a scale I'd imagined only on other planets. I knew that Mars held Olympus Mons, almost three times higher than Mount Everest, and this surely must have compared. Glowing a subtle red under bright gold and the flickering light of battle, the iron-rich formation radiated an odd sense of optical distortion from its sheer size.

I'd wondered what lit the place, and it was not an individual golden Shield like I'd assumed. No, it was much more than that: erupting steadily and continuously from miles-wide holes in the barren earth, tremendous beams of glorious golden light shot like angled pillars into the void sky. There were four nearby that I could see, spaced regularly, and I could sense the glow of others in the distance. I had the sudden idea that this entire barren pocket-dimension-Earth was covered in regular outlets for these sky-rending beams - that this reality, and all our realities, were being protected by the heavenly fire erupting from tremendous machines deep within the world.

And I imagined that, at most times, they were smooth and coherent. Now, though, on the Eve of the Closing of the Fist, those golden energies raged at the heavens. Their intensity was enough to nearly blind, and holy fire arced and spat and roiled up into black. The ancient machines below were clearly far over their intended operating strengths, and we could actually see where the empty sky above had begun bearing down on those furious energies like a hand held flat against the stream of a water hose set to full blast.

This was it: this was the most clear indication of how dire the situation had become. It was no wonder that the thick flood of people around us had become charged with righteous zeal at the sight.

We ran with them, keeping our little unit together, and trying not to draw attention to ourselves. I held my section of pipe at the ready and turned my gaze down from the black and gold above to the crimson and red below.

For the red Mountain's vast base now held a dark ocean; there had been no burials, and the rock here had not absorbed the remains. The millions upon millions that had died here had been left scattered upon the stones, and a sea of blood lay between us and our destination. It was into this knee-high unholy horror that the tide of righteous anger carried us.

I could sense the anguish, disgust, and determination in those with me, and more. The air itself seemed to hum with supercharged emotions. The hearts of humanity sang high, the notes weaving into a shifting aurora with a strength I'd never felt before. Anger, desperation, hunger, sacrifice, love, hate and fear.

They were telling me, with the fire of their searing hearts, the safe paths ahead.

Trying not to choke on the stench, I stomped through the thick knee-high and warm liquid with a singular focus. Chris followed closely, crying noiselessly, and Jay and his men formed a knot just behind. Together, we clambered up an escarpment to the left of the main flow of novice soldiers. The beleaguered and frantic enemy had their exotic weapons and threats trained on the largest masses of people, and we needed to avoid those killing zones.

"Aren't you afraid at all?" Chris demanded, climbing up onto the small plateau with a wild expression. Purple flashed somewhere, briefly lighting his terror in violet.

Breathing hard, and fighting down the urge to vomit after wiping as much blood away as I could, I stared at him. "*Of course.* That fear is going to keep us alive."

Jay reached the top of the climb next, his eyes brimming, but his manner focused.

"Why our Earth?" Chris demanded, even as a terrible explosion somewhere made the rock under us shudder.

I stood. "What do you mean?"

He stood to match me. "I heard Jonathan Cortin's story. I heard about the sea of darkness out there, trying to wash in. How did it just so happen that we were so close to Jonathan's shattered world? We were so close, his damage leaked into ours!"

He wasn't wrong, but I didn't think I would like where he was going with the idea. "What of it? Bad luck."

"They evacuated our *whole world*," he choked out, tears streaming down his hard cheeks. "Do you have any idea what it was like to hear that news? To have to just *start walking one day,* to have to leave your home? Do you even have a place you call home?"

Jay watched our conflict, wary, as the rest of the men began reaching us.

Chris let his real concern finally drop. "Did you ever figure out if you just find these things? Or if you *cause them?*"

"Cause them?" I shot back, feeling truly horrified for the first time in years. I said, "You think I could cause *all this?*" And I waved my hand at the gold-lit crimson-bloodied exploding and rumbling insanity but the thought that I was a lightning rod for Very Bad Things held a certain terror. It was not the first time the thought had occurred to me, especially as the worlds of man had begun to collapse.

Jay stepped between us. "You two will have to have this discussion another time."

He faced me. "How arrogant would you have to be to think you had anything to do with all this? There are nearly a trillion people suffering right now, my daughters included. Your story is just one star in the night sky."

I shut up, my fears happily brought short. "Thank you."

He clapped me on the shoulder, and then turned away to face Chris. "I owe Noah my life. So do these men. He also owes us his. Or his duplicate does, I never quite -"

The momentary calm in Chris dropped away. "His duplicate? From that canyon, all those years ago? But I thought -"

"Don't think about it," I told him, sincerely warning him away from the mental topic.

Something tremendous and winged flew by our sheltered little outcropping, and our group collectively ducked.

There was no more time for discussion. I led the way forward through jumbled boulders. Blood had been spattered here in many places, for the fight had shifted often, but it was not nearly as putrid as the sea of blood and corpses below. We picked our way over the dead and the injured, unable to stop to help them.

I paused at a gap between two large slabs of rock. An open and flat expanse of rock lay between us and the next bout of cover.

"What is it?" Jay asked, coming up close behind my left shoulder.

Focusing hard on the feeling, I played my senses over a very sharp and brutal spike of abruptly silenced fear. "Death." I couldn't see much of the battlefield from here, but I did sense a valley of motion, action, and surging hope but I didn't like its location. "We have to jump back into the blood."

Chris closed his eyes hard for a moment, steeling himself, but nobody questioned my order.

We crept up, over, and down the other side of one of the large rock slabs, finding a straight slope back down into the sea of charging men and blood. Jay went first, guarding me as I skittered my way down. I grimaced as thick sludge pooled up around my waist. Shouts, distant explosions, and the screams of the dying surrounded us, and we were forced to direct the others down with hand motions. The sharp metal smell of blood hit my awareness with a cutting force. I forced down rising panic from the animal parts of my brain.

We moved. High spires of rock clutched speared corpses, and their empty eyes followed us as we slipped among the sloshing crowd. I could feel the trauma bubbling beneath the brains of those around me; they knew what they were wading through, but they chose to delay caring until death or victory. Those who screamed for help would not receive it; those who became injured would die here, of exposure or infection. There was simply no stopping the hateful tide, and this Hell, though lorded over by beams of surging heavenly light, had no mercy.

Glaucous light erupted in a strange bloom to our left, quietly destroying the area we would have been in had we not diverted at my order. I saw Roger tremble, but continue on beside me, his expression full of overwhelmed resignation.

Every single person around me was convinced that death was imminent, but none were letting it stop them. I felt an odd pride at that.

It was tough not to slip on the mushy bodies hidden underneath the waist-high rippling crimson, but we moved forward by helping one another. The crowd, too, pushed on ahead and behind us, wading straight into unknowable flashing, slicing, and sighing deaths near where the tattered remnants of the Black-eyed Army were making their final stand - the sealed entrance to the Capital Temple. On our way toward that deathly place, I diverted the group on six more occasions - each time avoiding some terrible threat that would rear up soon after, swoop in from above, or explode. Every threat was obvious in the tapestry of human determination and terror singing all around.

Or, so I thought, until we came upon a cloud of sensations I'd never experienced before.

Here, the rock was higher, and the blood only an inch thick around our shoes. A thick swarm of human beings ran at a single tremendous black-eyed soldier, who stood a foot taller than the rest, and muscled with wicked black veins. A strange and spiked emerald shoulder-mounted device glittered evilly with each swift motion as the dark-haired and dark-eyed soldier sliced men and women apart with impunity. His motion seemed to never cease; he blurred from spot to spot, murdering with incredible skill.

Worst of all, to me, he existed in a fog.

I had only one command, one thought here, as I pushed Chris away and shouted to the others: "Run!"

In a split second, countless overlapping emotions hit me at once. A tremendous wave of pains, dreads, and alarms shot up from within, and I swung my pipe around at the empty air directly behind me.

Somehow, impossibly, the animal strike landed.

The black-eyed soldier stumbled back, clutching his face as pitch dripped from a freshly opened wound.

I turned away, overcome by the deeply layered confusion of what had just happened - and clutching a half-inch wound in my arm. His blade had come from behind somehow, and had been aimed at my heart.

He stared at me, his breathing ragged, his void eyes furious. His voice cut through the screams and shouts all around us like the sibilant whispers of a shadow I'd once encountered. "*Why can't I hit you?*"

Unable to focus, I stumbled back, and three men from the crowd caught me and helped me stay up.

The black-eyed soldier took a deep breath and readied for another attack. "No matter. You won't land a third hit."

A third hit? The fog the cloud of overlapping emotions! The spiked emerald on his shoulder looked like some kind of ornate ancient piece of armor, but I could see retrograde jade electricity moving in directed patterns within. The blur he made when he moved - that device was doing something impossible. As I processed the different patterns of layered emotions I'd felt, I began to -

I didn't have a choice. I grabbed one of the men who had helped me remain standing, and I threw him forward. He fell against the black-eyed soldier, who had appeared before me without warning, and took a stab to the chest.

On pure instinct, I ducked down, narrowly avoiding a wicked slice just above.

Full of adrenaline, I leapt to the side, avoiding an attack from behind.

Each move came with a sudden knot of dozens of emotional reactions, all from within. I could see now why the swarm of men around us had been unable to touch this soldier. I reacted, he reacted to that reaction, and - the part that everyone else was missing - I reacted to his reaction, barely avoiding his strikes.

And none of it was happening in the right order.

I decided to phone a friend. "Heath, any info on that device?"

The response came quickly. "The device on his shoulder allows him to move a few feet in space and about a second back in time!"

I took this in as paradoxical emotions hammered me into action without thought; every interaction between us ended only when one of us made a mistake or ran out of breath. Trying to achieve clarity through the fog of past and future emotions, I let furious energies within rise.

He chopped down with his wicked blade - I dodged to the side. He went back to that moment, and sliced sideways instead - I leapt back. He went back to that moment, and appeared behind me and stabbed forward - I whirled away and swung my pipe at his face. He went back to that moment on instinct, avoiding the hit, and briefly lost his footing in the inch-deep blood.

The only thing anyone else saw was me swinging at empty air, and him nearly losing his balance for no reason - because none of the other clashes had actually ended up happening.

Pulse racing, I faced him, and he stared me down with his void eyes. I could sense past and future emotion - my own emotions, in particular - to anticipate his attacks in a way that nobody else could, but I couldn't teleport or rewind. We stood in fist-clenched stalemate for several heartbeats.

I remained solid in thought and stance. If I so much as intended to speak or move, he could rewind and appear back to that exact moment of mental shift, and I would be lost. He knew that, and he waited for his opportunity with predatory intensity.

We stared at one another.

The legion around us had formed an astonished circle, and it now finally broke as men rushed in to attack him.

Those men fell even as they made their decision to charge, each stabbed from surprise angles. I saw something drop into the blood, and I knew I had my chance.

He could react to my reactions to his actions, but that meant our fight was a dance; a cloud of possibilities through which both led. I stepped forward, purposely leaving myself open from behind, and he took that offered opportunity, appearing behind me for a vicious stab.

I stepped away with a curving motion; he moved ahead instead of appearing behind me; I leapt to my right instead of stepping away with a curving motion; he appeared ahead and to my right; I jumped to the blood-thick ground to avoid his swing; he appeared above me instead of any of those other actions, slicing down.

I raised the pipe with my left hand, but used the right to pull - up from the blood - the fallen knife I'd seen. With his eyes on my other weapon, he never saw the knife until it was too late. He rewound on instinct again.

All anyone saw was me standing in place - and a knife suddenly appearing in his gut as he stood on the opposite end of the encircled crowd.

A great shouting rang up all around, and the soldier doubled over, clutching the blade in his intestines. It wouldn't have been enough to kill him - but the crowd was on him in an instant, and no amount of teleportation or rewinding was enough to save him from every angle while so wounded. I knew it was over when I saw a wild-eyed woman finally tear the emerald shoulder device off of him.

He fell, screaming in agony, as a dozen blades and mallets and pipes and spears ravaged his flesh. At the end, I felt something dark lift within him, and a great flood of remorse and longing followed.

At the end, he'd regained some small part of himself.

They tore him to pieces, enough that he'd never regenerate, and his black blood mixed with the red underneath my drenched shoes. I walked closer, looking for what pieces of his uniform remained.

Rothman.

He'd been a person. I hadn't killed him, but I'd watched him get torn apart, and felt his last moments. I'd been there with him through his last moments of terror and realization. He might have been a monster, but there had been a person inside that monster - a victim.

Four hands clapped my arms. Jay and Chris pulled me away. "We have to keep moving." 

Deadened now to the tremendous horrors all around, and caught in a focused daze of strange pain, I led our dozen men up a high trail of rock. The fight raged below in a wide artificial caldera set perfectly at the base of the mountain, where the last two hundred members of the Black-eyed Army employed all their tools of destruction to keep the raging sea of humanity away from the doors to the Capital Temple.

Those tremendous and intricately carved chrome doors were open, and I could feel the expansive and airy sensations of Thomas' people within, but those dark soldiers were not retreating. Trying to get a better look, I crept up to edge, prone.

Jay lay next to me and peered over the edge, taking in the scene. Strobing light of all colors, most especially violet, flashed across his features as he took in the beams, explosions, and erupting death. "If they retreat inside, they'll be truly cornered. They're trying to hold out for something."

It was Roger who said what we were all thinking. "Their weapon of last resort"

Reaching out with my feelings, trying to ignore the sopping wetness of blood in all of my clothes, I took in the billowing tapestry undulating over the tremendous battlefield. My eyes pulled toward one of the furious miles-wide beams of golden light in the distance. "There." My heart seized. "*Now.*"

As one, we watched. 

An infinitesimal dot soared down into that light, as if someone on the edge had thrown something within. The dot dropped and then flew back up, propelled by golden light. Its presence cast a shadow upward; at first a filament, and then a column. With startling speed, the darkness expanded and burst straight up, cracking that metaphorical flat palm above.

As we watched, that golden beam flared wildly, curled against black and went out with a titanic sputter.

"What just happened?" Chris asked next to me, staring.

Heath's concerned voice sounded in my ear. "We've just suffered a catastrophic failure of part of the Shield"

Everything in me froze.

The change in the air crept up on me with less speed than I might have expected - it was true and absolute terror on a scale I'd never imagined, and purer than I thought possible. I understood. "Their weapon of last resort a device, and a tactic. The prodigal sons, disgraced, are returning home. They're hoping their parents will handle us."

Chris trembled. "Their parents?"

Jay hit the rock beneath us with a balled fist. He wasn't afraid; rather, I sensed remorse. He was thinking about his daughters.

I had no words for him. There was no escape. Not from this.

As we watched, the starless sky cracked in, somehow bulging with an even deeper darkness. In that gloom-cast terrain that now lacked a golden beam, an answering black dot dropped from beyond. It floated down under its own power, impacting rather gleefully below without a sound.

Another black circle followed and then dozens more.

All prone, we clutched the rock beneath our hands in animal fear as countless black spheres floated to scattered locations all around us.

I knew what they were, but there was no need to explain to anyone else. They were Death, and worse.

With an almost leering delight, the Shadow Spheres began pumping out roiling darkness. It was the Ink, as Ward Shaw had described to us, and a new black ocean swirled out to cover the crimson one in the same manner that Rothman's blood had mixed beneath my feet.

This was it. This was the Black-eyed Army's last resort: they'd let in the monsters knocking at the door.

I could already feel the soul-rending terror and pain coming to each and every human being besieging the mountain. They were running from the Ink now, but it would blanket this entire battlefield. There was nowhere to go. In a few scant minutes, the millions here would suffer a fate worse than any imaginable.

How had I not felt this coming? The strength of emotion here, the unity of fear, was overwhelming. "I'm sorry"

Jay turned his head. "What? That's it? Don't you have some idea or something you've sensed?"

A choir of shrieks and screams echoed up from everywhere only to be silenced piecemeal by oncoming Ink. What possible useful elements could remain? The tapestry began to dissipate in the ungodly wind light vanishing, dark growing

But one piece remained that was neither, and both.

There was no time to explain. The sensation was on the move, and I knew what it was. More than that, it felt meant to be, in an odd way I'd never felt before - *because I would never have sensed him without the dream-stealer still at his side.*

I'd let them go on a whim, because they were like me - and now their presence might prove that last little thread to make it through the needle.

Without time to explain, I leapt up and began sliding down the steep and blood-splattered slope to the artificial caldera below. Chris, Jay, and the others followed, their dread momentarily held back by hope that I'd found something.

He was among the crowd surging against the remnants of the Black-eyed Army, and I pulled at his human arm with a shout of urgency.

He turned to face me in surprise, and I knew we had what we needed.

One of Jonathan Cortin's eyes had turned black.

I shouted, but he couldn't hear me over the tremendous sounds of fighting. He and his dream-stealer ally followed me back to the group, and I told him what we needed.

He stood in place, taking in the mission. He was covered in blood - both black and red - and I could sense that he hadn't expected to survive this long, let alone be given the most important task of the siege.

"Look," I told him, as we hid among boulders. "You're part shadow, but you're still in control. They won't know, as long as you keep contact brief. I can feel you, and you feel very much like them" I paused to look up at the high walls of inky void washing toward us.

"I can see in that blackness," he added, somber. He glanced toward his female dream-stealer companion.

I took in a relieved breath. "I was hoping you'd say that." I pulled my mic and shoulder camera off. I handed them both to him, along with a very special cellphone. "When the Ink comes, you have to make a run for the doors to the Capital Temple. With any luck, you can get right by the Black-eyed soldiers, and the Ink won't harm you."

Chris added a reference I never would have thought of. "Carry the football into the end zone for us."

Jonathan looked between each of us with his disparate eyes. "And what about you guys?"

I looked to them.

Roger shook his head.

Jay looked down.

Chris screwed up his face sadly, but said nothing.

The other men watched with grim resignation.

I summed up their silent responses. "We've gone as far as we can."

Jonathan's companion grabbed his arm but then lowered her gaze, realizing she couldn't stop him.

Heath had primarily just been watching until then, but I heard Jonathan say back over his new mic, "Good to see you alive, too."

We huddled in our hidden alcove between the rocks as Jonathan stood, pocketed the Key program in my cellphone somewhere safe, and prepared for a dash through Inky hell.

The darkness came like a silent tidal wave, and he took off, running with it like a surfer on a curling wall of water.

Then, sight left us.

Jay pulled a flashlight from his belt and shined it at the main entry to our little space. Only blackness showed beyond, about ten feet out. Only silence echoed inward. I could *feel* screaming out there, *feel* torture beyond endurance, but I *heard* nothing at all.

I sat with a dozen men, my childhood friend, and a female dream-stealer, wondering if this was how it was going to end for us. I'd been the only one capable of getting us this far, and now we'd handed off the mission to the only one who could take it from here and, after Jonathan, it was all on Heath.

A sharp sense of triumph reached me from the proper direction. "*He made it!*"

We laughed, clapped each other on the back, and - froze, as mocking laughter echoed from the darkness outside our alcove. The shadows had found us.

Chris clutched my forearm. "I'll always hate you for getting us into these situations, buddy."

"I know," I replied, trying hard to feel sad or worried. I just couldn't, though, because the shadows were too late. Destroying us wouldn't accomplish a thing, and they'd, in fact, empowered their own defeat here by infecting Jonathan.

Who would have thought that *I*, of all people, would have ended up in such a situation? I could have kept to myself, stayed safe, or gotten someone else to do it

But I hadn't. That meant something.

Our knot of humanity gripped hands as the mocking noises outside our small bubble of light began to grow louder. I'd suspected the shadow creatures had some sort of corporeal minions - the things that had ripped apart so many soldiers - and it seemed we were about to finally meet them.

Except I could still sense that I was going to write this and share this with somebody. It wasn't my time to die

I could sense that there was another part to this story. Metaphorically speaking, I scrolled down to a comment below. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can a psychopath love? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-21 23:44:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I read this aloud at an event at the Iowa Summer Writing Festival two weeks ago. I wrote it specifically for that event, because each reading had to be under three minutes. Enjoy!

---

Can a psychopath love? The man I've been studying had eight hundred and seventy-six self-crafted books in his basement. He's a teacher at the local elementary school, so no one thought his collection odd.

I did.

I snuck in one night, and found that each book contained a first-person story about the capture, torture, and maiming of a child or teenager. I gave the police an anonymous tip, but the books were gone by the time anyone came around to check. He was too smart for that simple measure. I tried to get my son transferred, but there were no other good schools nearby. It was clear that I had to take matters into my own hands, despite the risk. In planning this man's death, I had to ask myself: can a psychopath love? Can a psychopath achieve redemption, or at least a net positive effect on society, enough that his continued existence is justified? Killing a man is not a task to be taken lightly.

I asked *him* these long-held questions as he lay bound in the open grave I'd dug for him. We were far out in the woods, now, so I let him answer openly in the chill night air.

He knew that I knew what he was, so he didn't bother with feigned emotional theatrics. His face was stone cold. He said: "Love? I haven't hurt a single person yet in all my years. Every time I feel the urge toward violence, I write down what I want to do, and the urge passes. I do this out of self-preservation, because I love myself."

I held my shovel low, pausing as his words stirred some strange notion in me. "You love *yourself?*"

"Yes," he affirmed, gazing up at me. "That is what it is to be a complete psychopath. Egocentricity to the utmost. No other morality. But love *is* still possible - for oneself."

That was it - the disruptive kernel I'd been looking for. I began to understand what had been bothering me about my plan to bury one of my child's teachers alive. I asked him one more question: "Would you consider a son an extension of oneself - and therefore included in that strictly egocentric love?"

"Actually, yes," he replied, as surprised as I was.

The idea was logically shocking. Psychopathic minds *could* love - perhaps not for the same reasons as other people, or with the same textures, but it *was* love. Positive social value was achievable. Continued existence was justifiable. Families were possible.

I lowered my shovel to the ground.

"Then we both now understand why I'm doing this." I began to shovel dirt on top of my son's potentially dangerous teacher. It didn't matter that he might control himself. Any risk to my son was unacceptable - because my son was an extension of me, and I loved myself.

My latest victim made no last ditch effort to escape. He understood, and even shared catharsis at the revelation we had found together. His existence had not lived been in vain, and mine would not be, either. As the dirt piled up, he nodded with cold, unfeeling, and purely intellectual empathy - the only kind we had.

	<TEXT> You know, I actually tried to start this. I gathered a few people and made a google group, and two other stories were contributed. A lack of approved meta tags and greater participation sort of left it dead in the water, though.

Those two stories are:

(I have the author's contact info but his username appears to have been deleted)

and

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sohn9/it_watched_us_play_update_part_3/

by a RL friend of mine who writes maybe once every couple years, often at my insistence and with my editing :p

I would love to get something like this going again for another try.

---

The framework was this:

 So, this is definitely experimental, but I think we could do something great here. What I've got in mind is a group of different stories, written by different authors, that all fall under a common theme.

 Theme: something bad is happening in the realities in which human beings live, and the individual storytellers are largely on their own.

 Factors:

 - There is no shadow organization or functioning military aware of the situation (too cliche :) ). There's no 'help coming' and nobody to tell. Governments won't believe the individuals in our stories, or won't want to believe for their own reasons.

 - There are dozens of human realities that contain a total 947 billion people. We all exist in a sphere of realities that were protected before, but are no longer. This protection faded over the last few years, and now all sorts of terrible things from the multiverse are seeping in. Of course, none of our characters will really know this. 

 - The events of a story can involve almost anything, including much higher stakes than normal NoSleep stories. The world can be at stake if done right, because we're all not necessarily in the same realities - one guy's Earth could be destroyed, while the rest are fine. I think this is the main selling point of this project. We can write NoSleep stories that are above and beyond the normal limits because of the concepts they're couched in. **[7/20/15]: this didn't end up working out ;p**

 - The threat in a story can be almost anything as well. Whatever you can think of probably exists somewhere, so it can come here and cause problems. I've got an extensive regional map I work from, but there are plenty of purposeful unknowns. **[7/20/15]: spoilers!** I can tell you, most importantly, there are a few nearby political allies and enemies, and a few regions of lifeforms that are so different from us that we can't even establish communication. Notable ones being the Gemstone Hegemony - a vast region of Earths populated by varying crystalline lifeforms - and a spectrum of Earths conquered by a very egotistical planet-sized plant that has bred all sorts of biological plant-based nightmares as toys, weapons, and servants.

 - The style can be uniquely your own as well, since we are different people telling different stories.

 - These events were set up by my Portal in the Forest series http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2m4i88/the_portal_in_the_forest/  and my Desolate Guardians series up to part 5  http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2qej4k/judging_by_the_message_i_found_someone_somewhere/ , but you don't actually have to do anything with those elements if you don't want to. I do have a network manager character who is trapped in an office building, with access to the Internets of every human reality, who has seeded ideas everywhere to start people noticing what's happening. He is more than happy to use radio / email / video to contact characters, coordinate efforts, arrange help, and so on if you want. There is something more to his situation I can't get into yet without spoilers.

 For the title - whatever title you choose for a story, add [Humanity Under Siege] if it falls under this framework. That's a meta tag to let readers know what we're doing and what stories to look for. **[7/20/15]: these tags didn't ended up being approved** </TEXT>

	<TITLE> As a student studying abroad in Prague, I stayed at a house that held a terrible secret </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-19 00:12:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As I stood at the base of the long lane beneath, staring up at my distant destination, I supposed my perceptions of that house were being colored by my recent breakup. The plan had been to attend to our studies in Prague together. Instead, I stood alone against the parching summer winds, studying a lengthy alley that carved its way up the precipitous hill with an ancient laziness.

Lost in brooding need for motion, I ignored my initial unease and slipped into the cramped canyon where that serpentine alley began. The walk was quiet, taxing, and lonely, but passed by without note in a blur of regretful and nostalgic thoughts. I was in another country, but I'd not yet left the old one behind.

As I emerged from the narrow shade, sweaty and bitter, the hill's crowning residence greeted me with a resurgence of disquiet. The high house had once been noble, and sat apart, towering over its environs like an aging patriarch with a tired back. The fourth and highest floor carried a visibly dangerous tilt toward the terminal precipice of that final lot, an illusion I attributed to the hill's steep angle and the stone's weathered patterns. Shadows streamed from sharp carvings, casting incomprehensible patterns across the wasteland of cracked medieval pavement that otherwise ran bright under dry winds.

I was not the only student staying at the Moravec house, and this was hardly the first year that its surviving matriarch had hosted academics, but I still had to force myself to approach. An inexplicable revulsion held me back, trying to warn me away, but there was no specific reason I could gather to truly give up and return to my home country.

And she was there, in my home country. Disquiet or no, I couldn't go back.

I gave a gentle knock on the wide wooden door.

An arid breeze brought a sigh past my ears. I looked back at the cobblestone lane, but the mid-day sun and patterned shade held nothing but emptiness, and the odd tiny weed dancing in the wind.

The door swung open, and I turned forward in sudden embarrassed surprise.

A white-haired woman stood waiting, a pleasant smile on her face. She carried a slight hunch to match that of the tired house itself, but her clear blue eyes still shined with particular energy. Her calm and positive tone carried only a hint of accent. "Our last student! You've arrived!"

"Lady Moravec," I responded, following the cultural advice my advisor had given me. It felt odd to address someone with a noble title like that, given that she stood before me in jeans and a faded orange shirt that seemed reminiscent of earlier decades. This was not an old woman - this was a woman who happened to have aged.

Her deeply wrinkled face curled up in genuine humor. "Dear, really. Call me Aneta." She pulled a cellphone and typed in my name and details. "So that I'll remember," she explained, before returning it to her pocket.

I stepped inside after her, and immediately shuddered from the chill within.

As she led me into the house, I saw almost immediately why she needed to record my details. Eleven other students sat in a long dining room. Lunch had finished at least an hour before, but the plates remained on the table while cultures clashed and friendships were forged.

I was in no mood to meet people, and Aneta seemed to notice. Instead of introducing me immediately, she showed me the way up a surprisingly narrow set of stone steps that I figured must have been for the servants - back when the house had employed them.

The chill deepened as we climbed.

"Is it just you here these days?" I asked, adjusting my backpack and holding myself closer against the drop in temperature.

She kept moving, but threw a smile back. "If the cold is bothering you, I can get you a sweater."

"No, I'm fine," I lied.

At first, I assumed the house's ancient construction kept it cold, but we passed a vent - and the icy air brought me a shiver. I'd seen signs of modern renovations in the front hallway, and that was true here as well.

We came to the top of the stairs, and I blinked against the sudden change.

White was the dominant color here. The long and close hallway was incredibly clean, and populated only by a decorative little table or two with plastic flowers in small vases. I immediately found myself thinking of the place as *icy*, given the painfully chill airflow rolling toward us and the harsh lack of color.

Suppressing an oncoming chattering of my teeth, I forced a smile and followed her to my room. She had assigned me the one at the end of the long hallway because I'd arrived last. That was fair enough, but I was already considering the walk back to the stairs a *trek* that I would have to endure with each departure and return.

The room itself was plain, spartan, and serviceable. There was no air vent within, so the temperature was higher, and the patterns were all brown. Glad to escape chill white, I ducked within and dropped my backpack to the floor.

A moment later, I thought to thank my new host, so I popped my head out.

She had already left me to my own devices, but she had not departed entirely. I watched her open a nearly invisible white closet door, pull out a vacuum, and begin cleaning up the very scant dirt my shoes had left behind.

I supposed it was necessary to keep the smooth alabaster wood floor clean, but something about her movement and manner came off as a bit intent, or even manic.

Taking care to avoid any noise, I closed my door, and then went about assessing my new living quarters.

The single window was made of thick double-paned glass. Beyond, I could see a great deal of Prague, and nothing of the winding lane I'd traveled earlier. This window faced the hill's precipice, then, and I peered down at a dizzyingly steep series of rooftops that dropped haphazardly into a sea of buildings far below.

Hoping for a better view down, I tried to open the window, but found that it was set wholly into the wall. Not only could it not be opened, it had been constructed to purposely lack the ability.

I supposed that was necessary to keep guests from falling out.

There was no air flow in my room, however, so I wondered if it wouldn't begin to feel a little claustrophobic over the course of the semester.

I supposed that I wasn't really intended to spend much time there. The house *did* have a sprawling layout that probably allowed for privacy through sheer size. 

Shrugging off my continuing unease, I headed back into the icy halls.

I did see the narrow stairs back down to the front, but I also looked the other direction.

The hallway terminated at a junction, where a fancy portrait hung on the wall. I approached it, studying the image of an older and respectable man. His heavy eyes gazed eternally at something in the distance, and I knew instinctively who this was: Rosta Moravec, the man of the house, and Aneta's late husband.

I'd been told not to bring him up.

Standing there in front of his picture, I pulled out my phone and looked into him.

His respectable portrait seemed a sham as I read paragraph after paragraph about the scandals of his life. There had been rumors about gambling, about successful shady dealings to recover family wealth, and about womanizing.

The article also included an image of a woman I recognized. It was Aneta, lacking a number of decades, and quite beautiful for the change. She stood with her husband, smiling with that same particular brightness.

I stared - at first, because she caught the eye so strongly, and then because a strange shock ran through me.  It was brighter and much less worn, but I knew the pattern.

She was wearing that same orange shirt.

It was a picture of the two of them, from before all the scandals. I supposed that shirt meant something to her.

A subtle sigh reached my hearing. I looked up, confused. Had that been the same sound from outside?

The revving of a vacuum startled me, and I hurriedly put my phone away as Aneta's swift cleaning motions brought her closer. She kept her eyes on the traces of dirt I'd left on the sheer white floor. "Please join the others downstairs."

I did as she asked, wondering if I hadn't heard a slight anger in her tone.

The other students pulled me in from the first moment, demanding my story and friendship, and I gave them what I could. They were nice enough, but my mind was still on a girl I knew I would never speak to again.

That, and on the oddness of the house and its sole caretaker.

School started, and I had less time to think about it, but nobody else seemed to find it odd that she wore that same orange shirt every single day. She kept it immaculate, just like the house, so the others chalked it up to her being set in her ways.

I heard that same odd sigh twice more over the next three months, but I imagined it had to have come from the air system.

Because my room was unsuitable for waking pursuits, I often wandered the house, and eventually found a library. In addition to a huge range of first-print classics, there was also an entire section filled with medical texts. Each had been leafed through in great detail, and written upon with intent. Notes marred almost every margin. They were a bit old, but close enough to modern.

I'd intended to ask Aneta about them until the nature of the notes changed.

*you bastard*

It was probably my tenth time perusing the dusty and unused library, and my third time examining those medical books, so I had to stare for a moment to comprehend what I was seeing. Someone had jotted questions above, and then answered them; someone had noted important sections below. Between

*you don't get to leave me*

*i'll found out who she is*

*i'll find out who all of them are*

I swallowed down a return of that unease I'd felt my first day, and then carefully placed the books back the way I had found them.

I kept my thoughts to myself for a time, and only pursued my concerns in a roundabout manner.

The twelve of us had finished dinner, and a few glasses of wine had been had, courtesy of our absent host. I knew who would speak most freely. Wright was an American, and the drink went straight to his mouth every time.

At an opportune time, I leaned close to him. "Say, do you know anything about how Rosta died?"

His dumb grin told me I'd struck gold. He gave me a conspiratorial whisper that I was sure everyone in the room could hear; my only saving grace was that their drunken conversations had them riveted to other topics. "Rosta Moravec!" Wright let out a little burst of air and gave a great nod. "Disappeared."

"*Disappeared?*" I asked, a terrible suspicion coming over me.

"Not gonna find that on Wikipedia, are ya? Heard it from a local chick I hooked up with my first week here. Only the locals know about it. Whisper it, you know."

I tried to sound only casually interested. "When did he disappear?"

"Ten years, I think," he responded, before leaping up. "Bathroom time!"

He was gone in an instant, but a dark heaviness remained in his absence.

I took my leave, and headed to my room, cramped though it was. I sat between close brown walls, staring at my sealed window. What had Aneta done? I absently bit through each of my nails one by one before I decided I had to investigate further.

The main complication was clear: Lady Moravec never left the house. She loved the house, and kept it chill, austere, and maddeningly clean.

That gave me the idea.

During another night of drinking, I gave Wright an anonymous gift - a potted plant, something which he found uniquely hilarious for reasons beyond my ken - and he proceeded to almost immediately trip and smash it, exactly as I'd hoped.

Aneta raced out from rooms unknown and proceeded to clean in a panic.

I slipped away.

Her room lay at the very back of the house, and I hurried toward it without my shoes. In socks alone, I left no trace of my passage on the stark floors.

The door to her room creaked open with a blast of icy air. I braced myself for the coldest room yet and crept inside.

Everything within was white.

The bed and all its sheets were white.

The desk was white.

There was no window at all.

I'd seen many of the signs, but I knew now that Lady Moravec contained some measure of hidden madness. This simply wasn't normal.

The desk drawers slipped open without resistance, and I leafed through several white journals I found within.

*he loves me*

*i'm so happy to have my Rosta with me*

I checked the corporate text at the very front of the journal - it was only two years old.

Either Aneta was completely mad or

When that sigh broached my senses for the fifth time since I'd come, I finally heard it for what it was: a distant, weak, and hopeless moan.

The truth struck me with an almost physical thump to the chest.

Rosta Moravec was still in the house.

Electrified by my new understanding, I began looking around the room with sharper eyes. Like the closets in the hallways, nearly invisible white doors had been set in the walls here. They were set high, near arm level, and too small to be accesses to another room, but I was still deadly curious. I approached one and slid the clean white wood panels apart.

An empty cube of space sat beyond, also bright white except for a single crimson little splatter. A drop of blood sat in that cupboard - and it had not yet congealed.

It was fresh.

A creak sounded in the distance, and I hurriedly closed the cupboard, checked the desk, and slipped back out.

The house's maze-like setup lent me a dozen paths to escape. I made it to my room, put my shoes back on, and then casually rejoined the dinner party in the dining room. Nobody had been the wiser. If anyone had thought about it, I would have told them I'd just gone to the washroom. 

I laughed along with their jokes and listened to their tales, but my mind was solely on the undeniable fact that something terrible had been going on in that house for ten years. Was Rosta locked up somewhere? Was Aneta torturing him?

Burdened with my horrible suspicions, I couldnt help but feel completely alone. The girl I loved should have been there to help. She would have known what to do. She had been bright, strong, and smart. I didn't understand why we'd ended, and I was far from over it even months later.

And winter was coming on, so my time spent in the house only increased. I used every moment of free time manipulating dirtiness in the house so that I would have a chance to explore each and every room one by one. If Rosta *was* in the house, there had to be a way to find him. I couldn't simply call the police - that had all been done ten years ago, apparently, and they'd found nothing. Without any evidence, I'd look insane.

My search took me deep into the inner workings of the house, most especially in my own room. After several days' work, I'd managed to remove a panel in the wall without damage. Beyond ran a great many wires, tubes, and so on. Those things I expected. There was one deviation from those expectations: several little glass tubes that ran from somewhere deep in the wall to somewhere else deep in the wall. Extremely small fibers sat within each. I stared at them for days, and even purchased a magnifying glass, but all I saw was dirty yellow with traces of red.

What thin fibers would be yellow with traces of red? I looked up wires, manufacturing, house hardwares I couldn't find a match.

But these tubes were a clue. I focused my explorations on the numerous hidden panels in the house, tracing the glass. Many spread out in branching patterns through the walls, often terminating into hundreds of very small glass tubes. What was I seeing? I still had no idea. I traced them the other direction, finding that they got fewer in number and thicker as I headed toward the heart of House Moravec.

By then, I'd grown used to the eternal bone-chill, and felt one with it. This house, and this environment, carried a bleak madness that I knew had infected me. Aneta had been obsessed with keeping her womanizing husband, and I had become obsessed with freeing him from her anything to keep from thinking about what was missing in my life.

A major break occurred in late December of that year. I hadn't gone to class in the last month; I'd needed that time to continue my search. I was glad for it, too, because it was during one of those hours that I was supposed to have been absent from the house that I finally found something important.

It was a closet within a closet, containing a hidden apparatus that pumped in and out like some sort of lung. The thickening tubes connected to it directly, and I managed to determine that this air system was separate from the icy air vents.

My immediate thought was that she was keeping Rosta somewhere isolated, with its own environment. That would have avoided a number of problems that would otherwise have exposed his presence in the house.

She was smart. I'd guessed it, based on her study of the medical texts, but now I knew. Those manic and sharp blue eyes hid piercing calculation. I knew that now, too, because I had the sense that she was on to me. I hadn't given myself away, and I'd made no mistake, but she seemed to see it in me somehow. Did madness recognize madness?

She made no immediate move against me.

I hesitated for a few days out of fear, but then resumed my search when I felt I had no other choice. I'd mapped out the entire house, and found no missing space. The entirety of House Moravec was drawn out in my hidden notes, and there were no extra rooms. I'd even rented a sounder and gone over every inch of the basement

It was that drawing that struck home the horrifying truth of what I'd been mapping. I stared at it, highly aware of everything around me. My brown room hummed quietly with the systems around it, snow fell outside the window, and I was holding a picture of something I recognized.

There was no more need for the game. In a shaking fury, I stormed through the freezing white hallways, heading straight for Aneta's room.

She sat within, writing in her white journal. She looked up with icy determination. "I see from the look in your eyes that you understand."

I shook with the strain of repressed violence. "Show me."

Her hunch disappeared as she stood straight with ease and grace. An affectation; another lie. She moved to the cabinets in her bedroom walls, and opened the one I'd found the drop of blood in. "Are you sure?"

I kept my response quiet, but fierce. "Show me!" 

She pressed a hidden square, and the cubical space lifted - it had always been a sort of secret dumb-waiter. I'd never thought to look deeper into it, because the space was simply too small for a person. It was the perfect size, however, for the head of an aging, womanizing patriarch.

The glass tubes moved with the mechanical case that came up. I understood, now, what had been done.

Aneta turned around and smiled. "He can never leave me."

It was what I'd suspected. The tubes I'd been mapping had been splayed out like a circulatory system, and I'd found the lungs. Rosta had never been in any room of the house. He'd been *in the house itself,* splayed out through every wall and floor. The tubes held his arteries and veins and this box held his head. I hadn't expected, however, that the system had actually *worked.*

Rosta Moravec was still alive.

He stared at me, trying his best to whisper for help.

Lady Moravec studied me with a bright gaze. "Are you going to the police?"

I shuddered. "I have to this is monstrous. Insane. Aneta, do you see what you've done?"

She gave a slow nod. "He can never leave me, or this house. I have everything I want." She took a step closer. "Before you inform anyone, I should tell you I've invited your ex-girlfriend, the one you always talk about. She'll be coming here next for the next semester. You could simply keep this to yourself and stay. This house will need someone to take care of it after I'm gone. Before that, I could help you *learn.*"

I froze, trying to comprehend what she was offering. She, too, had had a partner who had disappointed her and tried to leave... but she'd taken away that disappointment through science and madness.

When I didn't respond, Aneta moved to her desk, pulled out a medical textbook, and held it out.

I'd like to say I turned it down.

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/3bszih/our_final_acts_part_2/)

"Heath, can you hear me?"

I didn't respond. My gaze remained on harsh white plaster. The firm corner against my back and side reassured me in some primal way, but it wasn't enough. A twisted ball of unhappiness churned somewhere within me. Was it my stomach?

Did I even have a stomach?

I'd suspected from the start this time around, but I'd purposely remained in delusion as long as I could. Was that our only defense against nightmare? Not the power of self-sacrifice, as the bright and cheery posters in the break room insisted, but the power of self-delusion. An off-hours network manager tells himself he's a person. A trillion refugees tell themselves they'll survive the Crushing Fist. A nineteen-year-old boy plays at being a leader.

Danny's shout came in through my headset again. "Heath! Goddamnit, where are you?"

A green switch and a red switch sat untouched on the wall above me.

The sheer weight of my despairing resignation pushed a tired response out of me. "What is it, Danny"

A massive rumble preceded a burst of static. "We've got [] here. Farm realities four, six, and eleven. Lava bursting up through the ground in places. Sky's getting dim. Having to move [] people from problem areas."

I stared at the ellipses and brackets marking the missing bits of his voice. My lip curled down. How could I see formatting marks in spoken words? The surreal white server room's silence mocked me.

"What? Heath, we [] -"

My vision blurred for a moment, and I swallowed back bitterness. "What do you want me to do about it, Danny? Come help carry things?"

"What the hell, man -"

Another voice cut in on a different frequency. It was Alek.  "Heath, are you there?"

He was like me. He was different; not one of them. His grim and resigned tone suited my mood, so I responded. "Hello."

I could almost hear him shake his head as he spoke. "I've gotten inside Amber Five. There's a rather large crack in its individual Shield, coming from Earth Forty-Four. It's I don't know what to say. A host of nightmares are looking for safety, just like us, and this was an ideal hole to crawl into."

Of course. Everything was coming apart. What did it matter?

He gave me the specific information on his mind. "The Mictlan got here before us."

The shock tingled my illusory limbs. I sat upright. I was in a bad place, to be sure, but my dreams had been particularly haunted first by that monstrous threat's existence, and then more so by its sudden disappearance. "Show me."

A moment later, a rigged-up camera phone began sending me images. There was no need for a computer station now, and no need for self-serving pretense. The scene simply appeared in my awareness.

Alek and his men appeared to be crouched behind an aged wall carved from tan rock. Under distant whipping clouds and a yellow Sun, a jumbled panorama formed a comprehensive landscape; ancient tan and grey buildings with modern updates. This was a functional city, or had been, before the tremendous chrome spider had ducked into its reality looking for a place to hide. That was what I imagined the Mictlan to be, in any case - a spider. We'd never managed to film more than a single leg, but something about its angled curve, and something about the way it moved, made me shudder with that particular revulsion reserved for creeping eight-legged things.

That one visible leg dominated the horizon now, acting as a break among the surging trails of smoke and vapor. The city was on fire, and the sounds of desperate fighting were faintly audible on the video stream. From what we'd seen of other worlds, the residents of this unsuspecting Earth had no hope of victory.

Every new death added to the ranks of the invisible corpse-things that served the Mictlan itself. They *were* the Mictlan, and it was them. Someone had used a soul-reading device on one of the invisible dead and found only one word within: *Mictlantecuhtli*. If human beings had souls, no trace remained within those corpse-puppet slaves.

That was the fact that had tormented my dreams. The device had read the souls of those recently dead, those long dead, and even those who were still alive. If there was nothing but the Mictlan within those corpse-things, then where had their lingering humanity gone? Had it consumed their essences somehow? The thought of total non-existence had made me shudder, even as my confined and simulated life had begun to grow ever more claustrophobic.

There was only one way to escape the clutches of the Mictlan, and that method hearkened back to those stupidly cheery posters in the break room: self-sacrifice. Suicide. A bullet to the brain would be better than losing your soul, right? I imagined a scant population of survivors finding scattered refuge, slowly realizing that their only choice was to take care of their loved ones - and then themselves. That was the only way to continue on as something that soul-reading device might interact with, rather than a hollow echo of a lord of death.

It deeply disturbed me that such a choice made sense when the options were all worse. I'd definitely become aware that suicide was my organization's highly recommended last resort to avoid fates worse than death. That red switch on the wall hovered at the edge of my awareness, always.

Clenching my chest to hold in quavering chills and angry heat, I finally spoke. "Just run, Alek. There's nothing you can do."

He turned the camera toward himself, and the long-denied sight of someone else's face brought me a momentary relief. "I don't think running is an option anymore." He looked to his men for confirmation. "We're going to try something. I don't even know what."

I considered the sheer size of the godlike chrome beast, and my thoughts automatically pulled up general information from somewhere. "Weapons will never work."

"Maybe the Mictlan and I can talk out our differences. Have a chat over an episode of Gilligan's Island."

The files came up short. "Well, nobody' s ever tried talking to it."

"Really?" He paused. "Unknown doom's better than known doom, I suppose. Will you do me a favor?"

"Yeah."

"Just, uh, make sure Ashley knows not to wait for me. And -" His face ran dark and strained for a moment. "Ask her to let my sister go, if it seems like - well, I just don't want her to wake up from her illness and experience the end if she doesn't have to, you know?"

I gulped once to keep my voice from cracking. "Sure."

"Thank you. Seriously, Heath. Stay well. I think this is goodbye."

The stream ended, and I was left to staring at the wall again. The white wall was a better sight than the green and red switches above me.

A sibilant whisper floated past my ears. *How long?*

"Not long," I told my constant shadowed companion.

*You aren't going to renege on our deal, are you?*

"No."

I felt a hungry smile curl up somewhere nearby. No further whispers followed.

Someone around here, I'd found a file with my name in it. Seventeen other names had also been included, along with text profiles. There'd been no pictures, no dates, and no explanation, but I'd known what it was. Each person had had a terminal illness. I wondered, still, how many of them had chosen the red switch once they'd reached their limit.

Or, worse, how many had chosen to be consumed by the shadow creatures lurking somewhere out in the dark? I'd made a deal to save a friend, a few lives, and an important tool, and my agreed-upon time was running short.

Simply thinking about it brought me in contact with our makeshift Command.

A tech immediately handed me to the voice I'd had in mind.

The sounds of a headset being donned preceded Noah's concerned words. "Heath, where've you been? Danny -"

"I'm sorry," I replied. "I'm just trying to hold on here."

He seemed to empathize, in his own curiously distant way. "Just a little longer, one way or another."

At that, my attention turned to the data available through our network connection, and I took in the sorry state of things. We hadn't lost very many more worlds - a very few red locations on the inner edges of the Shield, and one brutal void at the very center - but the great sphere that represented our shared homelands was no longer, itself, filled with spheres. They were out of alignment, squished into odd shapes, and compressed, made that way by the algorithms I myself had written to create a visual representation of connection times, signal strengths and triangulations, and relative locations.

I'd been so busy helping people and wallowing in my own despair that I hadn't taken a look at the bigger picture in quite some time. It made me sick to think about what was happening, now, at long last - and I also understood why travel times through cracks were getting shorter. I'd helped guide reinforcements to Jonathan Cortin, the young man whose eye I'd burned out, and they'd reached the outer edge of the Shield in only a few hours thanks to the tremendous and growing number of cracks. For many refugees at the start of the crisis, that same journey had taken weeks - or even months.

"Where's Jonathan?" I asked, hoping to speak to him and apologize for his eye.

Noah gave his answer only after a languid moment of calculation. "He's gone. Off into the fight. He had a dream stealer with him, and she went along."

I actually stood up, finally, at hearing that strange news. They'd come for me a few times, but had given up after being unable to penetrate what they'd called the Great Barrier. That, and they'd realized I didn't have a body. "A dream stealer? Did you report it to anyone?"

"I didn't see the need. We're strange fellows, all of us. Even those horrible threats out there that have destroyed entire populations - they were just running for their lives, like us. There's something dark out there, a rising tide surging against the Shield from the gulf where hundreds of realities used to be, and it doesn't distinguish between human, gemstone, or plant." He said something briefly to a nearby tech, and then returned to his thought. "And besides, the dream stealer accidentally took a body that was fiercely in love with him. It's on our team, now, regardless of what it wanted before."

I'd known the dream stealers blended with traits of their victims to camouflage themselves better, but the notion that it was an involuntary mechanism struck me as ironic and hilarious somehow. "That's kinda funny."

A light laugh followed. "I suppose so." That small moment faded back into grimness. "They're probably dead now, though, somewhere in the fight."

Agitated into more than simply standing, I began walking. My feet took me out of the white server room, and away from those horrifying switches. "The fight! How is it going?"

"Not well. Millions dead, and all we can do is bum rush the pocket dimension with an endless flood of volunteers. There are some bitter tensions, too, because the First Worlders don't want to go. Might break out in fighting here. I don't know how long we can keep morale up."

I wondered what my first friend - well, the first friend that I could remember - was doing at that moment. I hadn't heard from or about Cristina since Alek had given his final vote. I was absolutely certain that she would have had a plan if they had allowed her to stay. *She* would have gone into the fight. Were her people - the same military that had taken me on as a dying volunteer for this pained existence - unlike her? "Why won't they go? Didn't we just save them all and take them in?"

A dismayed sigh followed that question. "They're quite far ahead of us technologically. Most of them, if they can afford the process, don't age. They've become incredibly risk averse, to the point of emotional imprisonment. Apathy, depression, despair I hear they actually started a global party once it became clear their world was going to be destroyed - they're *that* twisted up inside. They said it felt like being released from prison."

Even though I'd walked away from the red switch, I could still feel it nearby. That switch would free *me*, in the same fashion. Would I one day end up like those apathetic and broken people? I was closer than I wanted to be.

But wait - how old was Cristina? How old was I? *How long had I been stuck like this?* If the green switch wiped my personal memories, and if my brain didn't age

No. I couldn't think about that. That road - a realization of possible endless torment - could only lead to a mental implosion, and insanity. That was what the green switch was *for.* They'd thought of everything...

A new and much deeper voice joined our conversation. It seemed filled with calm assurance and deep compassion. "What he says is true. There are some still among the Capital Citizens that I remember meeting."

I sat down at my virtual desk and computer. "Hello - who was that? And what is a Capital Citizen?"

Noah answered first. "I know you don't remember, but *you* found the old facility in your files, and I went off into the mountains to look for what those files said might still be found there. He's the Key program."

Astounded, I stared down at my keyboard. "A brownshirt?"

That deep and compassionate voice came again. "Not the name I'd have chosen, but our people have always lacked a certain style. To answer your second question, the sentient primates we allied with an eon ago had different names for their hierarchies of power. To answer your first, I chose to permanently modify my form in order to perform a function. I need no name now, except Key program. That is what I do, and who I am."

I had not at all expected that. "It's nice to finally meet you"

"We've met before. Always, you were, Helpful Human Heath. I'm glad you've chosen to remain."

"You are?" I lifted my head.

"Yes. Eighteen young humans, and eighteen of our people. We chose this path together. Together, you and I - the last of those brave thirty-six - will help finish it. These people are dying en masse to pave a way to the main Capital Temple. There, I will do what I do and you must help them after that. There's not enough time for them to figure out the rituals, but the workings of the Great Barrier are implicit in you. Anything you touch will glow, and then proceed as it must."

"Me?" I knew he was telling the truth, because I'd accidentally activated First World machines before. The dark twisted knot in my stomach untangled into something far more active and anxious. Still - "Why me?"

"Simple enough. You're the last of the eighteen. Also, I think you want to help. It's just who you are."

All of my pain and anguish seemed to fall away as the critical task ahead sank in.

Did we actually have a chance?

Was I part of a *we*, and therefore not alone?

For the first time in far too long, that red switch seemed distant. Maybe I was trapped, or maybe I'd chosen this. I couldn't be there with them, but that didn't mean I couldn't help. Free of my pit of despair, I clambered into the light. There was one last struggle to undertake, and no terrible decisions needed to be considered until it was done. I wasn't being released from prison - but I was certainly out on parole.

My hands found my keyboard, and I adjusted my chair. I even felt myself smile. "Alright. What do we do?"

It was Danny's voice that answered. I heard him enter in a tired huff, and then loudly throw something on the big central table that had often hosted our team planning sessions. He seemed at once exhausted and triumphant. "I'll tell ya what we're gonna do, Heath. We're gonna read this guy's soul and get the drop on those bastards once and for all."

At Danny's instruction, a tech flicked on a webcam, and I began seeing the room firsthand.

A nearly-severed head, a barely-attached torso, and a flopping muscular arm lay on the War Table. Blood pooled out from the tattered remnants of a male corpse, but that wasn't what caught my attention. Within that battered head, black eyes stared up in unseeing horror at the ceiling.

Danny and another man were covered in black blood from lugging the remains across the grounds and into the building, but neither seemed to care.

Standing over the dead member of the Black-eyed Army, our leader lifted that strange device that they all, for some reason, kept calling a book.

---

The Sword's grim order astounded us all. "Head into the Ink. We must escape through the Sphere."

Through that fucking thing? We didn't like that at all. Not one bit.

But the rebels - and our former squadmates - were not in a talking mood. The rebels had been crapped on for years out here, and our former buddies had been tortured beyond reasonable response. I'd stayed out of loyalty to my country, even as I began to suspect we weren't really serving national interests, but it was too late to explain any of that.

Rothman met up with me while we ran. He shouted as we joined the desperately flowing tide of soldiers heading for the Ink. "Whaddya think, Sorkis?"

I told him what I thought. He spit his tobacco and fired off a few rounds at the rebels chasing us.

The brigadier general's voice came over the radio. "Our civilian specialists have confirmed that the Sphere is safe."

Yeah, right. We didn't buy it for two seconds, not to mention the techies gave me a bad vibe. I'd seen the hate in that one lady's eyes, one time, when somebody'd mentioned the Preacher. We hated it, yeah, but not like she did. Gave me the chills.

But if the Sword said something's safe, and if he was going with us, well it must have been safe.

Biggest mistake of my life - even bigger than getting that girl pregnant just before shipping overseas.

The Ink was dead by then. We'd shot it all to hell, mortared anything that moved, and cleaned it out. The Sphere was a straight shot for us, all downhill, even though the distances didn't make sense. Close to it, we began to be able to see again, in that creepy unlight that surrounded it man, if only we'd blown it to shreds when we'd had the chance

It wasn't showing all sorts of nightmare at the time. It had gone perfectly black, like it was waiting for us.

The Sword was ahead, and went first. He was just gone in an instant. Went into the black, which rippled like water, and nothing more.

Other guys ran in after, but I hung back in time to see the rebels on our heels, and I almost got shot for it.

So, sure, I jumped in.

It was like one pin prick, right? Let's say, on your pointing finger. You've got one skin cell that a really tiny pin is poking, and it hurts a little, but only in that one tiny little skin cell. Now imagine, you're completely *made* of cells, because you are, but *each one of those cells* has a tiny ice-cold pin poking it. Each one of those cells gets taken apart, toyed with, consumed, and crapped out by violent ice.

Then you get put back together one cell at a time, with an eternity in between each building block for you to feel what's being done to you and call out for your goddamn momma.

Rothman was right over there, but I couldn't reach him. His face was straight pain, eyes wide, mouth open - but no scream.

Someone was laughing. A swarm of angry and hateful children were crowded around us, in the metaphorical sense, and we were being dissected and played with in every possible way.

It felt good, for a time. Better than sex. Better than love. They turned on all the lights in my head in every single combination just to see what would happen. They ate that shit up. Then, they began eating my memories, relishing them, digesting them, and then putting them back in all sour and stained.

We didn't give up and let go, though. I could see my mates, all of them, and they could see me.

We got *angry.*

They tried to slice something dear off of us, but they started with the Sword himself, and *that* was a mistake. A purple glow in his spine knocked us loose from some sort of shadowy, fleshy, organic stickiness, and we fell into the waters of the mind.

That's the best I can describe it. There's an ocean out there, and they're the apex predators. They love the hunt, and the gutting, and the cleaning.

But we'd hopped the boat.

We staggered out of the shifting shadow-fog onto a beach made of bone. Not bones, plural, but one single smooth bone. I think it took us somewhere like our thoughts, because there was an ocean there - an ocean of deep red, like blood, but warm. The sky was grainy ivory white, too, and it was no place like I'd seen before. Bones like our beach shot up from the red in the distance, and living things moved about in that sea, under the waves

Living things that we captured and ate with our bare hands.

We were hungry. I can't even describe it to you. We were still us, but hungry like a violent pack of wolves. Talking was not our strong suit, and we would go days without speaking as we walked, ran, and swam our way around our new world. At some point, we started thinking again, bit by bit.

The Sphere showed up that night.

We weren't afraid of it anymore. We were strong, and we were dark. We were animals, in a sense, as if something vital had been taken from us.

The Sphere had followed us, because we had thought about it. This time, it took us to a place of our choosing, rather than that black hell. We used it again and again, and each new environment stimulated more of our minds into operation.

The Sword led us, first and foremost, through all these pains. He whipped us back into shape, made us soldiers again, and led us back to our first familiar places and our first familiar tools.

We had a base again, soon, and squads. We were alive but with new minds, new hunger, and new vision.

We could take what we wanted. There were squishy beings that were like us, but empty and weak. I vaguely remembered being one of them, but that seemed another life.

The shadows that had tortured us so deeply still lingered around us, but there was nothing left in us for them to touch. We grinned and waved at them with wicked hunger, mirroring their natures. I think we disturbed them in a rather unique way, but they were tricksters and predators, and rarely let on any sign of weakness.

Our alpha, the Sword, kept us focused on one task: revenge. Those that had tortured us were nipping at the heels of our former species, and we found great pleasure in the goal of denying them their feast. We stole weapons, technology, and exotic creatures that no longer posed a threat to what we had become. If the weak ones would not defend themselves, then *we* would do it for them.

It was easy, really. They never knew we even existed. We kidnapped those with useful abilities, and used our new tools to control them. We chased. We hunted. We tracked down certain beings who could be expended to restore the Shield.

But we lost our alpha. Our leader, gone. How could that have happened? Worse, we heard insipid signals that he had been a slave the entire time. *We* had been slaves, through him.

Without focus, and endangered, we thought to secure ourselves a home. We'd already protected the Shield for years. Why not take it for our own?

It was easy enough to secure the beings we needed. The vast campgrounds of the weak had lain completely open and undefended. We considered it a mercy to end a great number of their children, and spare them lives of mortality and weakness.

Suffering was strength. We suffered, each and every moment, in each and every cell, and it empowered us.

But then we came to the Mountain, and the weak ones met us, and the business of death grew more serious.

I diverged.

I was me.

I was Sorkis, my first name lost.

And the strength that we had reveled in had become a nightmare. Thousands upon thousands of weak ones stormed at us in endless procession, like mad beasts soaring over the edge of a cliff. We murdered five thousand with bullets and mines alone.

They didn't stop coming.

We wiped out ten thousand with choking gas creatures.

They didn't stop coming.

We employed the purple beam weapon that had been stolen from the Gemstone Hegemony eight hundred years before, and twenty thousand died.

They didn't stop coming.

We sprayed memetic acid, and a hundred thousand died in agony.

They began coming in greater numbers.

We detonated the mind-silencer, and five hundred thousand fell.

They just kept coming.

The tide never slowed. The surge of wild-eyed men and women - because that was what they were, not simply weak ones - never ebbed. The old and frail came at us with canes. Children nipped at our heels with daggers. I had no more bullets. I had no more wish to simply slaughter. I fought now out of desperation, running through the barren and corpse-littered boulders simply to remain alive.

I had been granted three tiger-eye sawblades, and I used them to protect three of my sides. They sprayed gore and death in every direction - but still, the tide of humanity came, ever more desperate. They threw themselves on the blades, clogging them with bone and flesh. They crawled under. They climbed over. They charged between.

Pregnant women. I understood that concept, now. I remembered. I'd had a child once. Pregnant women and children and old men and the infirm and the sick - wild eyes, bared teeth, screams for blood. They ran over the corpses of their fellows without a care, pushed at us like animals cornered by crushing desperation, for this was their *home*, and we had become threats - and, we'd made a crucial mistake. They were not weaker than us! Not in the least! A *trillion* bloodthirsty human beings were going to spill across this mountain and -

I screamed as a child landed a bite on my ankle.

It would heal. I sliced his neck clean with my heavy blade and -

Another bite landed on my other ankle.

I lifted my blade, but teeth clamped into my wrist.

The swarm - the swarm! I understood, in that moment, that I could never have survived -

A hook sliced into my back. Two bites on my thigh, three more on my side, screaming fire-eyed monsters swarming atop me, pulling at me, slicing me, biting me, God!

God.

I remembered religion. I

I wished I had somebody to scream to. These were the true monsters, more horrifying than anything I'd seen out in the deathly lands. The pain deepened in every muscle as teeth tore tendon from bone beyond any capability for my inner blackness to heal.

Bone exposed bone neck torn asunder by hateful clawing fingers

My spine broke, and they pulled half of me away

The monsters

The monsters we'd made by forcing them into a corner

Even my shadow sight failed me as my last memory floated back. Her name had been Abby. I had a child somewhere, hopefully still but I'd tried to take away her home. The rest of my pack would keep fighting out of furious rage, and try to wipe the human race from existence for the terrifying inner fire we'd seen here. I wish that I could change things they're going to use our weapon of last resort

I'm sorry, Abby, more than you'll ever know.

---

I expected everyone in the room to remain stunned, but Danny didn't hesitate.

"Weapon of last resort? What could that be?" He began directing people and shouting orders.

Staring in horror, I prompted my friend. "Noah, what should I do?"

He seemed extremely alarmed. "I honestly don't know, but I think I have to make a run for the main Shield generator complex before it's too late" He picked up the device that held the Key program, and a headset with a camera. "There's no time to wait. Are you ready?"

Shaking in my seat, I nodded. I would not be pushing that red switch, not until every single person I knew was safe. "I'm ready."

 Maybe five feet above the ground, it floated and glimmered quietly, a jagged little glowing purple line - a rip in nothing. As we watched, it began to grow thicker. The purple glow intensified, as if welling out from something deep inside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why thank you :)

I take a very careful approach to comments. I will never confirm or deny anything, but I **love** hearing reader theories. I spend a tremendous amount of time planning and forecasting elements I think you guys will enjoy. It's a surprisingly symbiotic process in a genre of writing that didn't exist until the last few years - interactive real-time fiction. The world and the characters had a direction and general destination from the start, but the angles or perspectives I use to look into the ongoing situation are definitely prompted by the readers in many cases.

I find something like /u/Red_Wolf_2's wiki amazing, and definitely enjoy looking through readers' takes on all the little elements that may have only shown up in a single sentence, but which took hours to craft. The wiki is also purely updated by readers, so I like that there are inaccuracies and guesses. Keeps people on their toes :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After much searching, I fear the picture may be long gone. However, the version of this story in the *Aberrations* compilation on Amazon does not have the picture, either. Instead, the ending is worded a bit differently:

---

Its a slow night for my typical excursions, but I do happen to overhear a disturbing exchange between a man and his friend seated nearby at the bar:

Tell me about it, women can be so confusing. I got one that tops it all, though. Way back, when Heather and I had just ended things. You remember her, right?

The friend says: Hah, yeah

Nothing bad, just didnt work. I think Ill never hear from her again til she calls me, says she hears noises outside her house at night. I wasnt sure what to feel, but I stayed over. She spent the whole night lying there awake, keeps waking me up saying Do you hear that? Do you hear that? and I heard some rustling or something, maybe a raccoon, but saw nothing out the window went back to sleep, right?

Anyway, maybe three days later she called asking for me to stay over again. This time she says she heard noises inside the house. This girl lived with her sister and that ones four-year old daughter, but says they didnt leave their room that night. Im a bit frustrated at this, you know, since she broke up with me but keeps calling me but Im still a man, so I take my tire iron over there and sleep with it nearby.

The man telling this story takes out a napkin and draws something on it.

But see here this is her room and her backyard, its fenced. Its got this gate. I had this idea then that she might have a stalker from the coffee shop she worked at down the street. The gate was creaky as hell, and if anyone was creeping about, wed listen for the sound of the gate. Instead, about 2 AM, we hear this creaking in the hallway.

The friend says: Damn, whatd you do?

I look over and notice a little movement. Immediately, I realize, Jesus Christ, theres a small crack in the wall  *and an eye is peering in, watching us.* I get up ready to beat someone to hell, when I hear a little girl giggling  kid you not, its just the daughter, learned to escape at night and wander around the house.

The friend says: So she was freaked out over nothing?

No, get this, she keeps calling me asking me to stay over, but I tell her I cant do it anymore. Its too hard on me.

The friend says: Wow, thats messed up. Was she just messing with you the whole time? Was there ever a stalker or anything?

Well you know better than I do, right?

The friend says: Whatcha mean?

Well I ran into her about six years later and she says she called you to stay over in the living room after that. Back then I actually suggested she call you, cause youd met once or twice at the coffee shop. I figured you were my friend, but the breakup wasnt bad, so chivalry and all that

The friend says: Seriously? When was this?

Like 02, round August.

The friend says: Now I know youre just messing with me, man.

What? Why?

The friend says: That was my 24th birthday or round, I remember it because my cellphone got stolen and I was too poor to get another one for a while.

Well that doesnt make any sense

The friend says: Oh my god -

What? What is it?

The friend says: Last time I saw my cellphone. Seriously. I remember this because I was so pissed off and went back there asking around  last time I saw my cellphone was at her coffee shop.

And youre sure you didnt have it then? But she says you came over and slept in her house every night for like a month...

The two men begin talking too quietly to be heard at this point, though I do hear several expletives. They soon hurry out, and I realize that they left the napkin with the drawing of her house on it.

Upon inspection, it looks vaguely correct, though its a bit inaccurate.

I smile fondly as I sit at the bar, reminiscing. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The police arrested a man that was covered in blood. I was sent to interview him, and his tale chilled me to the core. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-04 00:01:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I work for the blog section of a local newspaper, and, being new and young, I often get sent out on crappy assignments. My top pieces involve interviews with poodle groomers, sewage plant managers, and our local clown.

Yeah.

Quitting's not really an option in this job market, so I've stuck it out. My manager has noticed my dedication, I suppose, so he threw me a bone today: I was sent to interview a man who residents had seen being taken into the police station in handcuffs. The only thing the concerned citizens knew for sure was that he was a stranger - and he was splattered in blood. The police weren't talking.

On my way over there, I thought I'd finally gotten my foot in the door. This was a wildcard. It could be nothing or, I could end up famous overnight. I was genuinely excited.

Now I just feel shaken and distressed.

"Hey, aren't you Rob's kid?" a vaguely familiar policeman asked as I entered the lobby of their decently-sized station.

I shook off the torrential rains still dripping from my hair, and nodded. Constant recognition was one of the weird benefits of returning to my small town after college. "Yep. I'm here on behalf of the Dispatch, to interview the man that was just brought in."

His chubby jolliness faded into grim distaste. He paused a full five seconds before finally replying. "I don't think a good kid like you needs to be talking to *that* guy."

I politely began the spiel my manager had given me, even as I got my writing materials out of my pack. It was important to look as if I was proceeding despite the refusal. I didn't actually know if I was legally allowed in, but I acted like I was. "Well it's my job and he has the right to visitors, so -"

"Yeah, yeah," he said flatly, cutting me off with an understanding sigh. "Just don't let him get to you." He led me back through a couple dingy hallways. The back held the temporary cells, and he unlocked the first gate. "Grayson's in the last cell. I'll wait here."

"Okay" I entered by myself, moving past a series of gated cells. The last contained the only person in lockup.

His once-decent business wear was splattered in blood, yes, but he was not at all the image of violence I'd imagined. Tall, lanky, and topped by thinning blonde hair, he looked every bit an average businessman. If he'd had glasses, he might have been an exact match for one of my professors back at the university. For a moment, I felt let down. It didn't seem likely that there would be any sort of incredible story here just some sort of mix-up.

That feeling lasted only until he began speaking. He saw my media badge, and my pen and paper, and sighed with resignation.

---

I suppose you want my story? Yeah. I thought so.

After much consideration, I do think that I should tell somebody what happened. I'm aware of how it sounds, so I've mostly shut up until now, but I'll tell *you* what I haven't told the police. That'll satisfy my ethical obligation. It's the least required, and the most I'm willing to do, because of the social risk. You'll believe me - you're young, and look sharp - but most won't. I have no intention of ending up in an institution.

Don't smile. I'm serious.

Thank you.

Now, I do have to say that this all began quite some time ago. I was young, then - younger than you. The memories came back to me with the fog of very early youth, likely pre-teen. They were nightmares, you see. They haunted me for nearly a year. It was a *thing,* and my mother and father tried their best to find treatment for me.

The nightmares went away only after I briefly joined the Church, but I still chalk that up to coincidence. The religion thing is a whole other debate I've no energy to get into

It's thirty years later, give or take. I'm driving cross-country on business with my partner -

What business am I in? It's not relevant to what happened.

Smith and I were driving cross-country when we stopped at a dilapidated motel right outside a small town. We'd seen absolutely nothing but Midwestern farm fields for hours, so we took a walk into town to get some beer. Glenworth Heights could have been any other town. Looked like a million others, and looked like yours.

But as I walked into this town - you see, this is why I mentioned my childhood nightmares - I had the oddest sensation of dj vu.  Standing on that short main street, I felt like I recognized that particular pattern of storefronts.

Forty-five people. That's what the sign said: Glenworth Heights, population forty-five. It was a stopover on the way from somewhere to somewhere else, and nothing more.

But *I'd seen those buildings before,* cast in another light and another context. I'd seen them in nightmare. I'd seen the sky *bleeding.* I'd seen these buildings, rotting. Their inhabitants had dwelled within, maimed, misshapen mutated.

Smith had a good sense for when I was spooked. I remained tense, but tried to shrug off the strange feeling and allay his concerns.

Whatever mask of calm I managed to put on, it certainly fell away as we entered the liquor store. I'd called to mind the clerk's face *before* I'd gone inside. I'd told myself that he couldn't *possibly* be in there. I'd had a nightmare *over thirty years ago* about a twenty-something hippie-type whose facial skin had been carefully excised in front of me by steaming hooks.

In that dream world, his bleeding cheek and jaw muscles had been exposed to the air, but he'd continued working the front under threat of even worse torture at the hands of the store's owner who had become some sort of hissing acidic monstrosity that lurked in the back room. His hooked limbs dripped acid, and Lord... I can't even describe...

Forgive me. I just need a moment.

Alright. Where was I?

The clerk.

I'd called his face to mind, keeping it firmly in my mental view and I was greeted with that exact face as I entered the store.

I couldn't help but stare. Perhaps I'd been to this town as a child on some sort of family road trip, and perhaps I might have had nightmares about it later but how could I have dreamed, thirty years ago, about a clerk that was here *now?*

The store owner lurked in the back room - a thuggish man in a yellowed white shirt who lounged near a fan.

I left the store immediately, and Smith knew something was up. He began to get belligerent.

I assured him everything was fine. He knew I needed the money from our business trip to pay off my shrew ex-wife's onerous child support lien. I wasn't going to welch.

But there was another concern on my mind. I'd stumbled into a waking link to my childhood nightmares, and those nightmares had held a distinct threat. The town in my dreams hadn't simply been horrible for surreal reasons - no, a gaping fissure in the earth had opened somewhere nearby. Through that vast searing crevice, as a child, I'd witnessed people clawing at burning air from rivers of torturous bile blinding crimson and azure flames that kept thousands perpetually cooking alive and the screams

Don't frown with disbelief. It was just a nightmare. It was a metaphor, right? For fear, for pain for change. The townspeople had all changed, and then marched to the gap to worship it, widen it, and bring through demons untold. It was just a dream

Except that I'd *dreamed the location of the fissure.* Smith was suspicious of me, so I couldn't ditch him, but I made up a story about checking for money I'd left behind on a previous business trip.

We walked out into the sparse woods behind the town, and Smith kept his hand near his gun, but I was far more worried about encountering that hellish rift.

I was enormously relieved to find an empty forest glen and then subtly chilled to realize that I remembered the lay of the jumbled rocks, swaying grasses, and towering trees. I'd *seen this place.*

In a veritable trance, I wandered out into the high grasses. Once I was out in the center, I began to notice that the assembled rocks were strewn about in a pattern that was anything but random. It was a vast circle, and I was within bending down, I even found the specific rocks I remember seeing split apart before they'd begun belching flames.

Runes.

There were runes in the rocks - ancient runes, in a style that looked Native American or something even older.

Smith grinned near me, then, as I touched the rocks. He'd figured that I'd found the spot where I'd stashed my supposed cash. He'd also figured, since I was far superior to his usual class of partners, that I must have had quite the sum hidden there.

He *didn't* figure that I was also smarter than his usual Spic partners. I lifted one of the runed rocks and well, his skull caved in. He was dead instantly.

No, this blood on my shirt isn't from hitting him with a rock. And that's not why they brought me in. That act was self-defense, and I'll prove that in a court of law or I'll at least get the jury to understand. A dead thug, and a living well-mannered white man like myself? I'm not worried about it.

Don't make that face. I'm just being honest.

But no, this isn't that blood on my shirt - because the blood from that impact shot to the earth like it'd been pulled down by strange gravities. In fact, the red liquid spurted out of his head wound like a fountain, arcing right down to those runed rocks before me and disappearing between. It wasn't nearly all of the blood in his body, but it was enough to be surprising. The rest soaked his clothes and the surrounding ground.

Was it simply a nearby death that had reawakened latent energies? Or perhaps I'd accidentally re-enacted some ancient ritual

In either case, I found myself standing in exactly the spot I'd dreamed thirty years before, watching that exact nightmare unfold the ground splitting, flames erupting, and fiery heat radiating against my face as the screams of countless damned souls erupted into the real world.

Yes, I'm serious.

No, I'm not crazy.

I'm completely sane - and that's why I ran. What sane person would have stayed in such a place? Hell itself had partially erupted into a half-mile wide glen in the forest some ancient ritual site

I ran back to town, intent on getting our car. I'd had the remaining sense, despite my panic, to grab the keys from Smith's pocket.

But I did need something to calm my nerves. My hands shook violently. I knew I wasn't going to be able to drive so I entered the town drugstore.

I already knew the little old lady within. Her warm smile rang true against my surreal childhood memories. Her doddering husband worked the cash register while she picked out what I'd asked for, and I shuddered.

In my dream, the old woman's skull had split open, and her brain had grown teeth forming a fleshy maw big enough to crush and eat her terrified husband's face. He'd died gurgling and betrayed by his lifelong love and then his corpse had begun turning itself inside out, growing a thousand little spider-like limbs from the inner edges of his skin and muscles. The resulting corpse-thing had chased my terrified child self down the main street relentlessly and my only escape had been waking in a screaming sweat.

I remember him saying this yesterday, syllable for syllable: "What 're ye' lookin' at?"

He was asking out of kindness and confusion. He wasn't angry that I'd been staring at him while lost in memory. He was just worried about me - right up until the teeth slammed down and his face crumpled between brain-matter jaws.

Leaping back and knocking over product-filled shelves, I screamed in absolute terror. Who wouldn't? The old woman had become exactly what I'd - God! It was sickening!

Not waiting for his corpse to animate, I ran, surrounded by blurry panic.

The sky was beginning to bubble right over the town even approaching a boil. It looked like a rapidly building normal storm - not yet blood like I'd dreamed - but I was no fool.

There were screams echoing out up and down the street. Not the screams of the damned, but the screams of the living... those unfortunate souls who hadn't yet turned, being slaughtered by their friends and loved ones.

I wasn't changing. Why wasn't I changing? Had my presence at the ritual site protected me? Or was it the fact that these people had lived nearby the site their entire lives? Were they more susceptible somehow?

On my desperate run back to the motel - and to my car - I almost bowled over a startled old man who had been heading into town.

His skin was mottled, and he was very frail. He gripped my arm with surprising strength, though, and screamed at me to be heard over the raging winds. He said: "What have you done, boy? I saw you! What did you do out in the woods? *Did you disturb the stone ring?*"

My horrified stare was all the confirmation he needed.

He said: "The ring is a barely-cracked seal, and the Plagued townsfolk are going to try to widen the crack perhaps destroy the seal completely. I'm too old to do what must be done. *You* must either move whatever sacrifice you made and burn the corpse, or you must return to town and kill every single one of the monsters those people have become."

---

I stared at Grayson, my mouth dropping a half-inch. Holy shit, had this guy gone on a killing spree? I mean, I would have too, if that had all really happened to me "So the blood on your shirt you killed all those people?"

He looked at me as if I was a moron. "Do I look like some Spic enforcer? I've never fought a man in my life. Kill forty-odd horrible mutated monsters all by myself no, that would never have worked."

"I see" So, he'd gone back and moved Smith's body. That explained the blood on his shirt. Did that mean that there was still a small town populated by mutated horrors out there? Or had closing the rift destroyed or dispelled them somehow?

"Alright, I've told you what happened," he said plainly. "Any ethical obligation I had is now satisfied. It's on you."

Shivering with confusion, I gave some polite goodbye and walked out in a daze.

The cop who had let me in nodded as he saw my face. "Guy's a real prick, huh?"

"What do you mean?" I asked, knowing that he hadn't been told Grayson's story.

"He was going over a hundred down the highway, in a car filled with drugs, and hit some housewife's van," he said quietly, leading me back toward the front. "Killed three kids."

"Ah." I had thought, at first, other than shock. How shitty could one person *be?* He had children he'd walked out on, he was involved in crime, he was vaguely racist at least he'd gone back and - "Wait, so he got blood on his shirt from the car accident?"

"Yeah," the cop replied. "What'd ya think it was?"

I froze right at the front door to the station. Outside, torrential rains beat down on the glass.

Among all his other faults, Grayson was also a coward.

He hadn't gone back! *He'd just walked away!* He'd been warned by decades-old dreams, he'd been led to the place and time of a tremendous disaster, with knowledge of what was to come... and instead of becoming a hero, he'd screwed it all up *and walked away!* Was that the true nature of human beings, then? How many scary stories had I heard in my lifetime, expecting with each tale that I would rise to the occasion if they ever happened to me?

Here I was, also doing nothing about it.

What *was* there to do except stare out the window? I had no proof. If I did, I might have been able to call for aid, or go there myself and try to, as Grayson had put it, *kill forty-odd mutated monsters all by myself.* The thought made me quaver, and I kept finding reasons not to go and check it out for myself. Was I a coward, too? I didn't want to believe him, but there was such an odd feeling in the air

So much for rising to the occasion. 

I had no proof. The story of the century - my first big break, and possibly my last - would likely be believed by no one.

There's nothing left to do now but post it online and hope hope that someone does something, or hope that Grayson was lying.

After that, I'll watch the uncommonly intense rain and pray to God that it doesn't turn red.

I followed him about a mile south to a crack in space. The next world, too, had multicolored fractured skies, as did a few more after that. We darted through underbrush and down hidden crevices, staying out of sight. Our guide told me how surprised they'd been to find very few dangers on the way.

I didn't have the heart to tell him it was because they were all dead, or vanished.

The three of us walked for hours, often going in physical loops to circle back into the next fractures. Along the way, I stared around with my new shadow-sight. Nobody had mentioned noticing anything wrong with my eye did it look the same as always?

As I came out under calm blue skies for the first time in years, I stopped in my tracks.

Beautiful.

Home.

These things, I felt instinctively but something was off. It was like walking into somebody else's life.

The next few transitions were a blur of bright yellow suns and calm blue skies. I floated along, numb until the last rift brought me to a sea of tents and refugees.

I stared around, subtly chilled.

I'd already seen this.

Our guide brought me to a tent that had been reserved for me, and then left Beth and I alone.

I sat on my cot, staring blankly at the trampled brown dirt beneath my feet.

It wasn't grey.

It was such a mundane detail

The sounds of the crowded grounds were numerous and vague.

I stood and approached the tent's exit, remaining just within. A few rows over, an endless stream of concerned faces passed the gaps between the tents. It was a main path, and alive with soldier intent.

"Don't," Beth said behind me, guessing my desire. "You've been through too much. Seriously. Let other people continue on in your stead."

She wasn't wrong. I returned to my bed, lay upon it, and stared straight up.

In the distance, the sounds of marching never faded.

My eyes wandered, but I could not rest. Was I even capable of *resting* anymore?

Agitated. I was agitated. Scattered. What was I doing?

A man appeared at the entrance to our tent. He looked to be in his late twenties, and very serious. "Jonathan Cortin?"

"Yes?" I sat up, hoping for a call to action.

The man froze, and looked back and forth at the two of us, in turn, for nearly ten seconds.

I frowned. "What's up?"

He took one step backward and donned a guarded expression. "Alek couldn't be here, but he said to tell you he hopes you're doing well."

"Okay," I replied. "What's what's going on out there?"

He knew I was referring to the ongoing stream of volunteer soldiers. "There's a pitched battle going on around the main Shield generator complex. Over a half million dead, and climbing."

How? How had the shadow entities taunted me with exactly this situation? Was I *was I still there?* How would they have known what was going on inside the Shield? Unless they'd used real information to make the illusion more palatable. "It's the Black-eyed Army, isn't it?"

"Yes," the man replied, his features growing subtly suspicious. He glanced down at my gloved hand and sleeved arm, then back at me.

If they'd used real information "What about the sneak attack around the mountain?"

"How do you know about that?"

I stepped forward in shock. "Because *they* do. They already know about it!"

He reacted with grim energy. "I'll go warn headquarters." He paused for only a moment. "And I suggest you keep that one away from well, there are a few people and entities around here that'll know she's not human if she strays nearby. And good luck to you both."

*He knew!* How did he know? He'd known something was off about Beth and I the moment he'd looked at us! Why wasn't he saying anything? Why wasn't he calling someone to lock us up? Instead of delaying him any further, I just nodded.

He departed, and I grabbed my weapon.

"Don't," Beth begged.

I shook my head, and began running to join the reinforcement lines. I couldn't stay. I couldn't stop. I couldn't rest. I knew this might be my final act, but I had no other choice.

She had a choice, and she chose to follow.

I didn't think I was being deceived by the shadow entities, not in the least, but I'd realized that I would never be free. The years of unending stress and torture had permanently changed me. I couldn't sit here and try to pretend that I was a normal human being anymore. Something dark was festering inside me, my only true friend was a mind-stealing entity from another plane of existence, and my whole former world was gone.

Nobody in the line questioned our presence. We moved along with at a surprisingly quick and organized pace toward a ten-foot-wide ethereal blue portal a mile down the path. I crossed it without fear, understanding now that nightmare and death had *become* my home.

The sky opened up black overhead, but not the black of the void - it was nothingness.

A tremendous red mountain dominated the horizon, towering over most of the wide disk of land that I could see before the craggy landscape closed around us.

The mountain that must have housed the structure the man had talked about. I knew it had to be important, because an incredible array of flak, explosions, purple beams of light, clouds of strange gas, and odd swooping and flying creatures surrounded it, all engaged in some monstrous chaotic battle. But who was fighting who, with what I had no idea.

I had no idea what I was heading into, or what horrible dangers awaited, but it didnt matter.

I was home.

"Jonathan, I" She looked away from me, blinked wearily, swayed in place and fell backwards onto the ground, eyes empty.

That was it.

A thousand leagues deep beyond the mortal limits of exhaustion, she'd fallen asleep standing up for the barest split second and that had been it.

The dream-stealers had gotten her. Their threat was only dominant for twenty-six minutes a day, but they'd claimed far more than their worthy share.

I was alone again. The last of my volunteer reinforcements had fallen. I took her handgun.

Staring down at her mindless body, I felt a vortex of surreal stress grow around me. The only thing I'd treasured - not being alone in this place - had been taken from me. The social connections and alliances I'd made had slowly dwindled down to a desperate few, then a terrified two, then a single remaining friend, and then none.

The wasteland of blasted gravel and grey dirt seemed to instantly transform. Previously a battlefield full of plans and survival tactics, it was now simply an empty pile of dirt and rock in space. The Russian had died long ago, and the Yngtak lady out west had disappeared the week before. The radio had collected no transmissions from any other survivors in longer than I could recall.

That was it. The planet I'd called home - and the vast eternal battlefield whose monstrous sieges I'd endured for countless days - it was all nothing, now. All of the dreams and rivalries that had made it a *world* were gone. I'd thought I'd understood true loneliness. I'd dreamed about a universe empty of life, in which planets spun, stars burned, and nebulae drifted with nothing and no one to appreciate them but, that was nothing compared to the loneliness of a universe with one single conscious mind remaining. I could move around, I could build things, and I could knock things down and it would never matter to anyone at all but me. It was like being trapped in my own mind, or being left behind in a playground from which everyone else had already gone home.

My limbs remained motionless as she slowly blinked, clambered awkwardly to her feet, and began testing her new muscles. She looked around at the various horribly disfigured bodies littering the trench. "What a waste."

I gave a weak smile. "We used to take them out and bury them. At some point, you just don't have the willpower anymore. And you get used to the smell."

"Aren't you going to shoot me?" the dream-stealer asked, watching me with curiosity through her eyes. "You've picked me out of the crowd so many times, I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever make it past you."

"I haven't decided yet," I replied bitterly, my nerves burning with the short-acting stimulant that would keep me awake - and therefore keep me myself - through this part of my day. Encased in fiery physical heat and despairing mental ice, I began entertaining ideas and questions I'd never considered before. The siege was hopeless, and I was alone. Were the dream-stealers still my enemies? I looked in its eyes. "What's your name?"

It returned my gaze while it considered whether I was being sincere. It frowned, and then remembered to blink after a few confused moments of slight blindness. "I don't have a name."

"Fine, then. Where do you come from?"

It turned her head around and up, taking in the environment. "It's strange how *concrete* everything is. I've seen physical realities mostly through your kind's dreams, which always seem to constantly change in terrifying ways. I always thought you people were insane."

I couldn't help but laugh angrily. "Maybe we are."

It lifted the left corner of her lip in a sickening facsimile of a shaky human smile.

Swallowing disgust at the uncanny sight, I threw it her handgun.

Its frown was almost realistic. "Why would you give me this? After how many have killed each other between our two *grat-alenesh?*"

I didn't know what that word meant, but the context made it fairly obvious. "Are *you* going to try to kill *me?*"

It gazed down at the handgun. "Not today. I am the last. The black has the rest of my *grat-alene.* They are gone now. To answer your question, I come from a form of existence very much unlike this gritty and jumbled place that seems to be filled with endless bits of matter tumbling against themselves. Where I am from, your brains? No" It stopped to think for a second. "your minds the logical and emotional constructs that operate your biological machines your minds are like the plants that grow in this body's memories. It is a forest, and you are the trees. Or it is an ocean, and we all float along the currents inside it. And, just like your oceans, you are far from the only life. You are plankton, and we are the fish that live off of you in various ways."

"Great." My bitterness deepened as I listened.

It seemed to search her mind to confirm its words. "Yes, that is a good analogy for this purpose. You are the plankton, we are one *species* of fish and the beings within the black are *you*, as you are here. They are the voracious men who sail above our shared ocean, poaching, culling, and gutting with no care for harmony, stability, or sustainment. They will empty our oceans, and leave nothing, much as you have done to your own subservient natural order."

Now that caught my attention. "So that's what I've been seeing out there when the black comes all this time"

"Yes," it replied, in her voice.

"What *is* the black?" I asked, feeling a surge of motivation at this new hope brought by an unlikely potential ally.

"Does a fish know what a man on a boat is?" it asked. "Does a fish see anything but an impossible silhouette cast from a form of existence to which it can never travel? We did all we could do - we fled." It hesitated, realizing that it was no longer part of a *we*. "I fled"

I knew then that it wasn't lying. The crushing despair it had exhibited exactly mirrored what I'd been feeling. There was no faking that. "Here." I threw it a small black rectangle.

"What's this?"

"Ammo," I laughed. "Your gun's got no bullets."

It looked at me in momentary admiration, and, despite knowing that I was only seeing a puppet, my body instinctively responded with nervous stress to the attentive eyes of a girl who had remained passingly attractive despite her dirtiness and exhaustion. Forcing down that reaction, I turned away, fighting the urge to puke. I didn't want any part of me reacting to that *thing* as if it was a human.

By the time I turned back, it had figured out how to load the ammo. "What now?" it asked. "I suggest alliance. We two remain. There are no other minds in this pocket."

"This pocket?" I asked, blinking. "What you mean the universe?"

It nodded her head in a way that was anything but smooth and natural. It looked like someone had jerked on a string connected to her neck.

I raised an arm to the sky. I'd felt like the only mind left in the universe, but my heart began racing at the thought that my notion had been far truer than I could possibly have known. "Out there? The stars? Other galaxies?"

It followed the path of my arm up to the sky. "I know nothing of those places. But there are no other minds in this collection of matter, light cones, and quantum decision trees. We would have felt those minds, and attempted to flee into them as well."

All of my emotions fell away as my brain took in the fact that they just didn't matter anymore. Hope, fear, bravery, courage, love, and hate were all meaningless without other human beings and other emotions to match them against. No one would ever know what happened here, or any of the things that I'd felt.

At the very least, that meant I wasn't afraid anymore. I didn't care if the dream-stealer betrayed me and shot me like many of its fellows had tried to do. It just didn't matter.

I recited my practiced phrases out loud for its benefit. "Gravity, flood, silver nooses, flood, crazy, flood, silver nooses, crazy, dream-stealers, the black"

"The black is next?" it replied, trembling in an eerily girl-like manner. "We have to leave, ally."

"There's nowhere to go," I shot back. "And we can't leave, anyway. Us plankton aren't very good swimmers."

It stared at me.

"We also have a duty," I told it. "Look in her memories, you'll know."

"Direct memories are difficult. I have no context with which to activate them." It paused. "Didn't you have a much longer list of daily challenges when I last spoke with you through one of your fellows?"

"The shapeshifters joined the Yngtak lady, and then died one by one," I said flatly, remembering the deceptive conversation well. I'd shot my new ally in the head while he'd been in a friend's body - but he'd abandoned that brain in time, and survived perhaps to my fortune now. "The flames have moved on elsewhere, the invisible slicers fell dead for no reason we could figure out, the brain-eaters all eventually starved, the tree ghosts reincarnated into a forest down south, and the Preacher hasn't been around in months. Oh, and whatever made the death music screamed as something ate it. Loud enough to break glass from miles away."

"Understood," it said softly. "Not much life left in this *expanta* of the pockets."

It hit me that I was commiserating with the last of a former otherworldly threat about the deaths and disappearances of a legion of other nightmares. I think my soul understood, at that moment, that I was near the end of the story - my story, my people's story, and possibly the story of all life in our *expanta.*

An upbeat but sad song from my youth reached my inner senses, matching the pained and darkly chilled beat of my heart.

Something beeped at my wrist - the watch the now-deceased girl had given me. She'd meant something to me, but I didn't want *it* to know that. I sealed that away in my heart. The sky began dimming. "Time to do our duty. The reason we're here."

It remained in place. "We should run."

"No," I said flatly, walking away. "You can run, but you'll die alone if you do. I was alone in this entire universe for a moment, right after you killed that body you're wearing. It's the most hopeless feeling I can imagine, no matter what form of existence you're from."

It said nothing, but it did start walking after me as the distance between us grew.

That tumultuous and heartbreaking song grew in my awareness as I began the walk that capped the end of each of my days. As the colored sky dimmed rapidly to black and the stars came into view, the notes seemed to expand and fill the vast spaces above. I was the last living being in the universe, save one interloper who trailed behind, and I could almost *feel* my thoughts echo out into the endless reaches. There were no walls to reflect them, and no ears to hear them.

The grey dirt trench flowed past me as I walked on pure autopilot. I'd done this so many times before that I hardly had to think about it. As I moved, it seemed I could sense the weight of the past racing by me, like the lifetime that flashes before a person's eyes as their death nears.

Fourteen billion years. The universe had exploded into being, alone and empty, an infinitely hot and cramped little box and then expanded into a colder and limitless sandbox filled with *so much wonder.* Little cells had appeared out of that limitless chaos, and then grown and changed. Fish had darted around in primordial oceans on a heap of rock falling constantly toward a burning ball of gas it would never reach and then life had emerged onto land, and raced and changed through time and bitter battle to become something like me.

And then I'd been born, learned to stand, learned to speak, grown, sharpened, joined the military and all that life had fallen away around me, leaving me with this last walk along dead earth.

It had taken fourteen billion years to come into existence. How long would it take to end? Who would note its passing?

The stars faded, too, leaving a dome of infinite blackness overhead. It shot down and enveloped us in an anti-flash.

A scared hand found mine, and I moved along the trench by memorized rote, leading the dream-stealer forward. I'd grown used to the beginning stages of this waking nightmare, and knew my way forward.

But nobody could grow used to what happened in the depths of that unending void each night.

We soon reached the small concrete control station that marked the access to the tremendous underground equipment that fifty thousand men had installed long ago. Every single night, upon my return, I felt a brief dread that it might have been destroyed but it always remained, protected by absolute loneliness. My flashlight illuminated a small circle as I headed within.

"What's about to happen?" my new ally asked, stepping inside the small concrete box with me.

I closed the heavy metal door, locked it, and stacked crates against it, carefully placing them to block any gaps along the doorframe. "I don't have the words," I responded honestly, shining my flashlight around the small space to make sure everything was in order. "Just don't go outside, and don't open this door, no matter what you hear. There are no windows here, thank God, but don't believe anything you see, either."

The control desk itself was exceedingly simple. The computer terminals had all broken long ago, but the four-foot high metal activation stand remained. Someone had once told me it'd been designed to withstand nuclear assaults without losing function all it needed was a push of the large green button on the left. The large red button on the right presumably cancelled the activation, but I'd never used it.

One button push - and an underground particle accelerator and portal hub machine would hum to life and reinvigorate the walls of reality for one more day. I'd been told that the underground technology ringed the entire nearby broken city, and I believed it. The Russian and the Yngtak lady had each had their own camps and their own accesses along the ring of above-ground trenches, but I was the only one left pushing the button

The simple metal stand also had a charge indicator, which glowed softly in the gloom hovering outside the direct influence of my flashlight. The white bar sat at ninety-eight percent - just less than half an hour until the twenty-four-hour recharge cycle was complete. "We just have to push this button when the machines are ready."

My new ally saw the bar. "Almost time, then?"

I continued staring down at the charge indicator, wishing it would simply fill and spare me the coming experience for one single night but it never had before, and it wouldn't this this time. "A half an hour can be a very long time"

My ally remained close to me, clearly apprehensive.

I gazed around warily, trying not to think about the feminine body pressing lightly against mine. I still had a chance to shoot the dream-stealer, too something I seriously considered in a moment of sudden anger but that rage faded quickly as the concrete walls disappeared.

We stood on a circle of grey earth perhaps twenty feet in diameter. My flashlight shined out, vanishing without effect into the void. The ground itself ceased to be illuminated by my beam exactly ten feet away in every direction. For all I knew, we were standing on a dirt disk that was floating in nothing.

Small white flakes began drifting down from somewhere above.

"Snow" my ally whispered, finding the word in the neurons it had stolen.

That was something new and *new* worried me. I grabbed her - *its* - arm. "We're not really outside." I threw out a foot to kick an invisible broken office chair whose location hadn't changed in months.

At that sound, my ally stared down at the seemingly empty earth. "Are we safe? Like... in this building, even though we can't see it?"

*Like?* Its speech patterns were growing more like those of the body it had stolen. Shuddering, I could only give an honest answer. "I have no idea. I just know that anybody that runs out into the black never returns, except in pieces the next night."

"I've screwed up in coming here," she said, trembling and pressing closer. "I'm not any safer than where I was."

I shook my head. "I don't think there's safety *anywhere.*" As the first strange squeals reached us, I clenched my gloved fist hard around my flashlight, fighting the throbbing pain in my wrist and forearm. I would have pulled my sleeve back to check on my days-old creeping injury, but I didn't want my ally to know about my weakness or the fact that the black veins creeping up my arm always responded strongly to the void surrounding us.

A derisive laugh echoed from somewhere to our left. We stared at the darkness but nothing came of it.

The snow began falling more heavily, and sticking to the circle of grey earth around us.

Whispers came on a chill breeze from our right.

We turned our heads and stared, but, again, saw nothing.

*We should take his other eye.*

*We should take his face!*

*No, I have a better idea*

The taste of hickory barbecue potato chips oozed into my mouth.

A sibilant whisper rose above the others. *How long has it been since you've eaten real food?*

A thick and satisfying fullness followed the chips.

*How about steak?*

"What's happening?" she asked, clutching my arm. "What is this sensation? Is this taste?"

I nodded, my attention captivated by the amazing flavors of real food. For far too long, it'd only been military rations and sometimes, when I ran out, the cooked meat of fallen friends

Despite my best efforts, tears began running down my cheeks - even from my blind eye.

I couldn't think about that.

I could *never* think about that.

But the mocking voices out in the black wouldn't let me forget.

The stringy and desperately satisfying flavor and consistency reached my tongue and the insides of my cheeks, and I gagged.

Laughter erupted all around, in great waves that threatened to deafen me. *We've already* **got** *you, Jonathan. None of this matters. Why do you persist? It's only a matter of time. You could enjoy your last days in the throes of utmost ecstasy - not starving and tortured in an empty universe.*

My wrist and forearm pulsed with poisonous intensity. I thought I could feel the shadows creeping a little further up through my flesh.

*Everyone inside the Shield is already dead. Your world is gone. Why do you persist? Allow us to consume you.*

Fighting through the pain, I looked up at my ally, who gazed back at me with wide and terror-filled eyes. "That's not true. I sensed lots of minds behind the Great Barrier."

She clenched over in agony as the dark entities out there responded to her words with punishment.

I laughed. "You're liars! I'll never believe anything you say."

*Just don't press the button, Jonathan,* a hauntingly familiar woman said, stepping out into the beam of my flashlight. Her feet crunched in the deepening snow.

My jaw trembled. "Mom?"

*This darkness is what comes after life, and we're all out here. Never you mind these tricksters. We're all actually very friendly.*

Kind eyes moved closer, preceded by a loving smile and outstretched arms.

"Not real," I forced out, gripping my pained forearm and turning my gaze down at the snow around my feet. "Just go away."

The image of my mother lashed out with a vicious roar, but her form vanished before the flinch-inducing impact.

The girl clutching my arm seemed to come down slightly from absolute panic. "It's not real"

"In the sense that something real could simply stab us and kill us, no," I panted, trying to block the pain out from my head. "But whatever's out there, it or they actually *enjoy* this. They're just warming up, trust me. Savoring our growing pain."

*Like this?* a shadowy voice asked, mocking me.

The flesh surrounding my left hand began to peel back like a ripe banana being opened. I slammed my jaw shut and clenched my teeth, overwhelmed by the excruciating sensations of having my bones bared to the chill air. My watery sight, between pain-narrowed lids, saw my skin, muscle, and veins floating inches away from bloody ivory fingers and knuckles.

More laughter erupted as the flesh cinched back into place.

My hand was whole, and uninjured, but it had all been exactingly real.

It was *always* exactingly real, every single night.

Fighting back tears of agony, I pressed against my ally. That was the reason I hadn't shot her immediately, I knew now - I couldn't fathom going back to enduring this alone. She and I descended to the ground, trembling and staring around at laughs, shrieks, and inhuman squeals from the dark.

*Oh, I understand now,* one of the voices said plainly and curiously. *That one's not human anymore.* A gasp of excitement followed. *So that's where you've gone, plaything*

My ally clutched her face and began screaming, then, but the shadows were not showing me what they were doing to her. "How how do I turn off pain?" she asked in agonized terror.

I sobbed once before clearing my throat to reply. "*You can't*"

Her cheeks turned bright red, and tears began -

She stopped, suddenly breathing normally and rapidly. She looked relieved.

Silence fell.

That had never happened before and new was always bad, I reminded myself anxiously.

A great rumbling shook the grey disk beneath us, and the illusionary snow vanished.

Suddenly, I saw concrete and equipment - and not by flashlight, but by an infusing golden hue.

Without warning, a blast wave tore away the ceiling and most of the walls, and I clutched her close as a massive and insane torrent of golden chaos surged past us. Through barely opened eyes, I saw the trench and all the lands around ablaze with flames the color of the Sun. Shrieks echoed through the roar as the black vanished into dispelled vapor.

*This doesn't mean you're free,* said an angry whisper in my ear. *As long as we've got your hand, we-*

The voice cut off as the golden flames left us and rose higher, filling out the sky.

I understood. I knew implicitly what it was. "They did it!"

Slumping over, I clutched my arm as black ice forced its way up into my shoulder. The Shield had been restored by some distant action, and the shadows were trying to keep a foothold in me.

The sound of many booted feet sloshing down the muddy trench reached my ears.

I smiled, truly, for the first time since I'd been given reinforcements. First among the approaching men was Alek, the one who had led his people from somewhere beyond the Shield, through my world, and deeper into the core. I recognized his awkward and half-assured commands immediately.

He leaned over me. "Jonathan?"

I lay on what remained of the concrete floor, sobbing. "I didn't think you'd ever come back"

"We found a backup generator for the Shield and restored it to full strength temporarily." He ordered some men to pick me up. "Your duties are over now, friend. Time to come home and rest."

Rest? The concept was as alien to me as safety

"Beth is a dream-stealer now," I forced out, warning them. "But she helped me it's the last of its kind"

"Beth?" Alek asked. "Beth Daschel, one of the volunteers I left with you?" He frowned. "We passed her in the trench. She's lying there with her eyes open, a fresh bullet wound in her forehead. We thought you did that perhaps something got to her, and you had to?"

I pressed my head against the dirty concrete floor. It made a sick sort of sense. "I guess I didn't wanna be alone"

He didn't understand me, but I probably wasn't making sense anyway. I let the men lift me and carry me along under the suddenly golden evening sky.

Lost in disbelief that my duty was finally over, I stared at nothing, and responded to no one, until they left me in a small tent among a sea of other tents.

Alek was the last to remain. He stood above me, watching me carefully. "Are you going to be alright, Jon?"

I looked away, unable to answer.

"I have to go," he said, concerned. "There's a tremendous battle going on outside the main Shield generator complex. The Black-eyed Army has weapons and threats that go beyond vicious. There's a half million dead already but we can't stop. We're going to try a surprise attack from around the entire mountain."

A half million dead? The numbers boggled my mind, even more than the near trillion they'd told me had fled to the center of the Shield.

And Command was gone, along with something called the First World, where our superiors had secretly come from

I understood. We hadn't won a victory at all. In surviving out there and holding back the black from flooding in, we'd just delayed the inevitable.

"What's the Black-eyed Army?" I finally asked, thinking about the shadows creeping past the nerves and veins in my shoulder.

"Don't worry about that," Alek said. "You're safe now, and we're going to put an end to this. You've done enough."

With that, he was gone.

I stood, after a time, and sighed.

My watch wasn't beeping, because it had surely been silenced, but the timing had become ingrained in me.

The position had *also* become ingrained in me.

Taking two paces left and then three to my right, I reached out and felt nothing. The sensations on my fingers were surely being suppressed.

Alright one inch, two right there.

I felt nothing, but I knew I was hitting the green button.

I waited.

"Come on," I finally said aloud. "You think I'm stupid? Give it up."

A few more heartbeats passed. The underground machines would be revving up, and about to fire at any time. Why were the shadows still trying to trick me? I would *never* believe anything I saw or heard. How about that timing, right? Guys showed up right at the last second?

And still, I waited.

A horrible thought occurred to me.

Feeling my neck, I found icy veins arcing up behind my ear.

Could the entities out in the black control my senses now?

Was I still standing in that concrete control room? Had the machines activated and banished the black for another day? Was I oblivious to it all? Would the nightmare never end, now, for me?

Or *had I missed the green button?* Had they sufficiently disoriented me?

I couldn't just reach around randomly what if I ended up hitting the red button instead?!

"No!" I shouted. "God, no! Not after all this!"

Come on - give me one laugh, or one derisive remark - show me that I was still in the void! I couldn't *actually* have been saved, could I?

The dream-stealer had I imagined the dream-stealer out of some desperate fantasy?

And the iciness creeping up the side of my head was penetrating deeper

Grasping my blind eye, I fell to my knees, overcome by a sudden blast of sensations.

Blinking and looking around erratically, I realized what was happening: my blind eye was starting to see again.

But it was like no sight I'd ever had before. Where one eye saw the inside of a tent, and warmth, and light, and safety the other saw an ocean of darkness. Colossal entities, coiled up among their own endless snake-shadow bodies, hovered around a small circle of grey light. Their wicked maws and mountainous faces watched from an unknowable distance - and from ten feet away.

"You idiots" I croaked out, laughing after. "The black eye you've given me *I see you!*"

*Say nothing. He's lying.*

*Is he lying? The deception should have been perfect. Why would he be saying these things?*

*He's said quite a few things to taunt us in the past. This one little* **fivhen** *refuses to die. Such is the hardy nature of plague vermin.*

It was my turn to engage in mockery. I laughed even louder. "I can hear you, too."

They went silent.

A heartbeat passed.

The retaliatory pain was unlike anything they'd yet inflicted. Each night, they'd tortured me in different ways pathways physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual but they'd been trying to distract, confuse, and break me. They'd been confident of their eventual victory, and had taken to indulging in new horrors to inflict on their favorite pet.

This was different.

This was everything at once.

God didn't exist. The very concept had been ripped from my brain, leaving me with a blank where his name should have been. Nothing and no one had ever loved me. I would die alone, and there was no afterlife. I had no soul that would last, and I would simply cease to exist. Every single cell in my body burned with absolute agony, and my mind could not dull or avoid the pain. I saw my mother being tortured in eternal shadow and fire. I saw my own future - the same fate.

They ripped each and every patch of flesh from my body and scattered them to the grey earth, one at a time.

I climbed up, only bones, bitterly battling through a universe of indescribable agony of every imaginable kind.

I just had to reach that button... but the pain...

They allowed me to keep my sight so that I would understand what was happening.

They hadn't done a thing - oh my ___, they hadn't done a thing! This wasn't an illusion - they'd simply brought a portion of their existence in touch with mine. The black - *the black!* I understood, now, what was out there, and I I would beg to be consumed, rather than continue existing in that manner!

And I wasn't the only one.

I wasn't the first human to have found their mode of existence.

I could hear them distant in constant agony

It wasn't Hell. At least Hell had a purpose, and a will behind it *this was Hunger! And nothing more! An all-consuming need for all that life had to offer, from the deepest pleasures to the most exquisite pains*

A physical wave hit me from every direction, and I fell flat to the concrete floor, whole once again.

The dream-stealer in Beth stood at the controls, her finger on the green button. She shivered violently, still wracked with fading pain and the shock of absolute torture and then fell.

Crying uncontrollably from both eyes - and still seeing by flashlight and by shadow itself - I crawled over to her. She seized forcefully, and I held her arms down with the weight of my body and shoved part of my sleeve in her mouth to keep her from biting off her stolen tongue.

She'd done it. She'd managed to press forward where I had failed working together had been successful, where killing each other would not have been

Hardly able to move, I remained on top of her until she stilled.

Finally, after a long minute, she seemed to come around and she gripped me hard with both arms, sobbing with all her stolen heart.

"I'm sorry," I whispered. "I'm so sorry."

"Is that what you go through *every single night?*" she asked, audibly regretting coming to my form of reality.

I didn't answer.

Instead, I fought my way forward, crawling along concrete. There was still one more thing to do.

Pulling myself up the metal control stand, I reached out a hand and hit the green button a second time.

Or, really, a first time, since the push I'd witnessed had been an illusion.

I heard distant and angry hissing and I knew I'd succeeded this night. I'd never thought about their little tell, and had always kept it purely instinctive. They still didn't know that I could tell when I'd pissed them off.

My new darkness-eye showed me vast incomprehensible forms retreating into the dark.

One more day.

Every single night one more day, hard won.

My ally lay on the floor in a different position, but still sobbing from the unholy torture. She'd never gotten up to push the button.

I slumped. The threats would not return again until morning once the daily pulse had begun to fade.

Sleep time to sleep, finally

I fell.

Not even an instant seemed to pass before loud knocking woke me.

A male voice shouted from outside the door. "Jonathan Cortin? Are you here?"

I tried to speak, but failed on the first try. I coughed, and then called out, "Who is it?"

"You haven't been forgotten. Alek and the Council sent us to take over for you. It's time for you to head home."

Haunted and confused, I clambered up to the control station again and hit the green button. I wasn't going to fall for this.

Nothing happened.

I hit it again and a third time.

"No!" I shouted at it. "What the hell's going on?"

"Jon, open the door!" the voice yelled.

Through misty eyes, I banged my fist down on the green button over and over. "No, goddamnit, no!"

A heavy pounding began on the metal door to the control station as the men outside - if they existed at all - tried to bust their way in.

Wait what if what if I'd come up to the stand on the wrong side? What if the entities had switched the button colors?!

What if I'd been pressing the *red* button this whole time?

They didn't look any different in my two very disparate eyesights. Could the shadow entities fool my darkness-eye?

I put my finger over the red button.

What if I was wrong?

What did the red button do? Would it shut down the pulse? Would it doom us all?

Why had they even put a red button *in* without putting directions nearby?! Bastards!

I screamed in terror and moved to press the red button.

Beth's hand gripped my arm, stopping me. I hadn't even seen her get up. "Jonathan. There are minds outside. I can feel them. This is real."

Sinking to the floor one final time, drenched in sweat and covered in puke and - yeah, I'd soiled myself somewhere in the nightmare, too - I finally gave up. I'd pressed the green button as much as I could. If the shadow entities had pulled one over on me, well, then, that was that.

I walked over to the door and opened it.

An incredible line of men and women - volunteer soldiers, it seemed - stood in the trenches outside.

It might have been an illusion. I stood at the door, shocked.

One by one, in a long wave in both directions, each soldier held his or her hand high, saluting me.

The dream-stealer came up alongside me, looking on in wonder. I held her hand, and I think she knew that I did not intend to tell them what she was. She'd earned a second chance.

This this reinforcement had this been why the shadow entities had been so desperate to finally break me? Or were greater events in motion, finally, after all this time?

"It's time for you to go home, sir," the lead man stated, still holding his salute.

"Sir?" I asked.

"Yes. You've been promoted while in the field."

I looked around in disbelief. "To what?"

"To whatever rank you goddamn choose, sir," he responded, and the arrayed soldiers laughed and cheered. "You've earned it."

I closed my eyes for a long moment. It was all too good to be true. It had to be a trick.

Hope? What was hope?

Turning around smartly, I began to walk toward the control stand.

"Wait," Beth said, alarmed. She was the only one who truly understood why I could never give in. When she saw me continue to move, she leapt forward and grabbed my arm. "Stop him!"

A dozen men rushed forward and gripped my every limb, pulling with overwhelming strength. I fought with all my might, my finger inches away from the red button. "*I'll never believe you! I'll never fall for it! You can all burn in Hell!*"

Despite my best efforts, they pulled me away, and out of the control station. Grey earth grey dawn grey despair I sat down roughly. A dozen men and women surrounded me. They were no longer laughing, cheering, or saluting.

"It's really over," someone insisted, shaking me. "You're safe now."

I trembled. "Do you know how many times I've heard that? How many times you people have come to save me? Every single night"

Beth pulled me up. "Then save *yourself*, Jonathan. Pick a random direction and walk, and just keep going until you know for certain you're not in that hellhole concrete box anymore."

"Fine." As dozens watched, I turned around and walked.

I climbed up the edge of the trench.

My feet took me across the blasted wasteland, Beth close behind.

Shivering at the cool morning wind on my face, feeling every tired nerve in my limbs and every pebble underfoot, I had to wonder: was I truly free? Would I ever truly be free?

I remained in place, simply feeling the constant flow of existence, until I began to feel a little heavier. "Gravity"

It was time for the day's first threat.

"Have you made a choice?" Beth asked.

It wasn't really a choice. It was the same pain every single morning. At some point, you just had to soldier on. "Yeah. Let's go back."

The reinforcements in the trench were ditching their heavier gear, and making preparations to lie on their backs. They'd already been trained with the knowledge I'd given Alek and his people months ago.

The lead man, who had first faced me at the door, saw me and smiled lightly. "This way, sir. It's time to get you home."

	<TEXT> I stood outside a concrete bunker-like structure. Ancient oaks towered above on every side, shading me from the sun. I was Christopher, and nobody was supposed to know I was here but Kristoff knew, and he watched me from afar, like a confused young boy staring through a long drainage pipe at a strange animal on the other side.

While he stayed utterly still among dancing cyan and magenta lights, watching me from his distant aperture, I began walking under the shaded sun. Haunting echoes of the strange bestial sounds surrounding Kristoff left me as I crept around the backside of the fenced bunker.

The chain links were torn by time - no, expertly cut to look naturally worn away. I slipped between.

Crumbling concrete steps took me down into a shallow stairwell. A rust-blasted door had been left a few millimeters ajar. I wondered how she'd managed to get inside without disturbing the leaves beneath my feet and I grinned as I saw how they'd been carefully piled to scrunch up and slide naturally back into place as the door closed behind me.

Absolutely nobody would ever know about our meeting place - or our meeting. That was how it had to be.

There was no way to ever get used to the next step. There was something instinctually dangerous about a gun. When it was pointed at you, you *felt it.* You could put on a calm face, even make a joke, but you would always feel that dark little circle pointed at you like it was brushing right across your spinal nerves. Under that baleful sensation, I stripped down to nudity, verified that I had no listening devices of any kind, and then redressed.

"Good," she said flatly, sparing me any humiliating or awkward remark. "We've got less than an hour before the imaging satellites pass back over this area."

I nodded, remembering the path back to the stolen car I'd used to get here. "What'd you find out?"

Despite all our precautions, she still glanced around nervously and spoke quietly. "The program goes into mass production in four weeks."

At that, I stared. "*Four weeks?* I thought we had *years!*"

She shook her head. "It's a total coup. They surrounded it with so many layers of deception that they even had our high-level moles fooled. In four weeks, they're going to begin *editing* anyone who comes into major hospitals."

That chilled my soul to the core. The secret technology had been in its infancy only a year ago. How, then, could they successfully edit an entire functional mind twelve months later? It was as our long-ago professor had said, in private, to the twelve of us: technology advances exponentially, and exponential progression is something humans are not capable of innately understanding on an emotional level. The last few jumps were guaranteed to shock, scare, and catch us unaware.

"What can we do?" I finally asked.

She shoved a small pink box into my hands - one that looked like it might hold a cake. It was far heavier than a cake, however, and sealed shut. "Editing isn't the only technology that's advanced exponentially. Just get this bomb within the city limits. We don't need to know where their true headquarters are, specifically. It doesn't matter - not with the power of this explosion."

I held it carefully and stared down at it, feeling that same nerve-wracking sensation the gun had caused except throughout my entire body. "But all the people that live there?"

"Would you choose death or total mental enslavement?" she asked bluntly.

I gulped, trembled, and then nodded. "Alright."

Suddenly, time sped forward, and I darted back through the forest, into my stolen car, and back toward the city. Day circled down into night, and then I slunk out into the darkness, crept down an alley, and carefully placed the cake box in a dumpster. For a moment, I considered moving it out of the dumpster, fearing that the metal container might dampen the explosion but no. I stood in place for a moment, heart pounding. With an explosion that size, the metal might as well have been paper.

But I did need it to remain hidden for three or four weeks.

I moved the cake box into a defunct drainage sluice, and covered it with refuse.

It was time to go I looked up at the street sign as I exited.

The sight stuck with me as my soul seemed to pull back through that endless aperture.

Horrible sounds and dancing lights erupted all around me, briefly and then shut off. I realized that I'd been talking aloud about my memories the entire time. I, Kristoff, had been communicating what I'd seen down that long shadowed tunnel into my subconscious.

"Ah, thank you, 42," Doctor Hillan said calmly. "I've already sent a team to pick up and disarm your bomb. That act was mighty cold of you. Millions of lives"

I could still vaguely remember Christopher. "Wait but I I never went to a hospital!"

Doctor Hillan gave a deep Southern belly laugh. "We've since expanded the program, 42. Emergency rooms, triage centers the Minute Clinic at your local drugstore."

"No!" I shouted at him. "You can't do this! People deserve free will!"

"Oh, I would agree with you," he responded, slowly ramping the lights and sounds back up. "But you remember one of the patients I mentioned - 32? Holand?"

My blood turned to ice as I heard the similarities between *Holand* and *Hillan.*

"That's right," he continued, turning the torturous bestial sounds and cyan and magenta lights to full. "There's really nobody left untainted to turn this ship around. At least you'll feel better after I erase the last traces of Christopher from you. The doctor who did your first editing was mighty crude fortunately for us, I suppose. That bomb would have caused an immense tragedy, by denying so many such internal peace and harmony."

The burning smell came last among the torturous sensations, and I knew now why I found it familiar: I'd already been through this once.

But I wouldn't remember this time, just like I hadn't remembered the first.

Fighting the harness I was in, I made one last-ditch effort to remind myself.

On the way out, I shook Doctor Hillan's hand. "My head feels great! I really think my headaches are gone."

He smiled at me. "That's good, 42 Kristoff. It was nice meeting you."

"You too!" I waved at him as I departed, my heart soaring with hope. As I lowered my arm back down, I noticed some odd scratches. Where had I acquired them? I wasn't sure.

Oh well. It didn't really matter. My headaches were gone, and it was such a beautiful day out! There was no greater feeling than knowing that all was right with my head, my people, and my nation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Alek, you have to make a decision."

Wearily, I shook my head. The whole thing was too much to process, what with everything else going on. "I'm still thinking."

Her blonde hair tied back tightly, her face dirty, and her manner exhausted, Ashley still somehow managed to look pretty while frowning. "Don't take too long." Putting down her carried wooden struts for a moment, she wiped sweat from her brow and covertly scanned the endless sea of people around us. "The decision structure around here is shaky as it is"

I didn't need to be reminded of that. I still wasn't sure how the hell our motley collection of lead refugees had become an official Council, let alone one headed by a determined teenager and a swarm of kids. I knew part of it was simply timing - the members of our Council had been those first in the know, and those first to act - and part of it was simply fear of and disgust with politicians and police from our former homes.

But the third and final part, unique to my situation, still astounded and embarrassed me.

As I proceeded out of the resource stockpile area with my bucket of newly smithed nails, Ashley and her wooden struts alongside, I began catching surprised and happy gazes.

"It's him!"

"The Savior!"

"Alek!"

I tried to keep a polite expression as a crowd of desperate, tired, and hungry fellow refugees accrued around me as I walked. Some reached out to touch my arms - a new development, born of a sudden rumor that I could somehow heal people.

In one sense, that was ridiculous, but, in another we'd seen so much insanity. What rules remained? These people needed something to believe in, and, for what I'd done, they'd chosen me. 

I'd simply done what was needed. It didn't make me magical, or a hero. The flight from our home reality had been excessively dangerous, and reaching the outer Shield and proceeding inside through cracks had been a welcome relief. We'd lost so many on the way but then warned many more on our trek inward to the semi-safe center.

To these people, though, that early warning and pilgrimage had taken on a mythical status. They wondered how I'd known, they marveled at how I'd led my people in from unknown lands, and they were constantly grateful as I helped plan the endless camp grounds and distribute the food these farm worlds already had to offer.

And, try as I might, I couldn't shake the adulation.

So, as Ashley and my sister had suggested, I put on a polite expression and tried to endure. It was a tough act for an introvert, and it never seemed to get any easier.

The first crowd dispersed as we moved into an area of people that didn't recognize me. We dropped our materials at the makeshift structures being built by teams of volunteers. It would become a hospital, and it might help stem the rampant diseases and sicknesses spreading through our tightly clustered population.

It was strange to be saluted by men far burlier and cooler than I. I saluted back uncomfortably and turned around to make another trip.

The foreman approached and stopped me. "Sir, I understand you want to help, but your time would be much more valuable elsewhere. Any asshole can bring nails over from the drop."

He was sweating profusely, and a single drop hung from his hawkish nose. I tried not to stare.

"He's right," Ashley told me quietly.

"Alright," I finally responded, searching for one of the phrases I'd rehearsed in my tent late at night. "You're doing good work here. Thank you."

He took the phrase genuinely and smiled. "Anything to help."

He shook my hand, and I moved on.

The ocean of tents seemed the same in every direction. If it wasn't for Ashley, I would probably have regularly gotten lost. She picked the correct turn from the main dirt path, and found our tent directly.

Inside, I replaced the cloth on Laura's forehead with a fresh one. She was still unconscious, and her reddened face burned with fever.

Ashley shooed me away. "Taking care of her is my job. You have bigger decisions to make."

I sighed. "I know. I keep trying to avoid them, but nobody will let me."

She turned her head and smiled at me an exhausted, subtly fearful, and genuinely caring smile. "I know. And it might not matter, in the end, but I'd rather it be you than someone who *wants* to be in power."

That was a good - and chilling - point. I sat at my shoddily-built desk and examined the piles of handwritten notes, requisitions, and tasks. Oh, Lord, how much easier this all would have been with electricity and computers and the Internet only the key farming system structures had those, and we were a half-mile away from the main tech building.

I hadn't touched the first paper in days. It was the list I'd made of those killed in the Black-eyed Army's attack the same list I'd turned in, and that someone had transmitted to Noah Two. I didn't think anybody realized what I'd had to do to make it. I'd had to go there, after the attack, and ask people if their friends, family, and neighbors had died

while they'd still been crying, and trying to understand.

And I'd had to walk through a field full of dead children, teenagers, and their parents, confirming the casualties one by one because very few people could be told about what had happened because Thomas had to be protected.

I finally moved that list aside, trying to clear the images from my head.

Underneath sat an urgent request for food. A huge part of the efforts of our entire labor structure were devoted to distributing the farming system's food, so these requests were common, but this one was a bit old. I pulled my radio from my hip. "Hey, Jay, can you check on something for me?"

"Sure, what's up?"

"I have an urgent food request from 8-C-132-A. Looks like this one took its sweet time getting up the chain."

"Ok. Hold on."

I waited as Jay radioed the guy under him, and that guy messaged who? I brought out a stack of papers and checked our hierarchy. Some woman I hadn't met, who would be contacting the guy under her and someone would be walking out to check in person.

It took a few minutes for the radio to crackle back on. "Alek?"

"Yeah?"

"They're, ah... 8-C-132-A they're all dead. Starved in their tents."

I stared in horror down at the piece of paper that represented a quiet plea for help. "*What?*"

Jay's voice was bitter, but calm. "We knew this would happen eventually. Every process has an error rate."

I turned the radio off and clutched the paper in my hand. An error rate? We screwed up *moving pieces of paper around,* and a couple hundred people had *died*. It was made even worse, too, knowing that they'd believed in us 'til it was too late. They hadn't rioted. They hadn't stolen from their neighbors. They'd calmly waited until they were too weak to get help.

I tried to feel that pain. I did. But would this fate befall the rest of us shortly? A month, maybe two and there'd be no more food left to distribute. This entire effort would be for nothing.

No I couldn't think that way. We had to do everything we could right up until the last loaf of bread.

"Hello?" a young man asked from outside the tent.

"Yes," I said, letting him in.

He came over with wide eyes, still star-struck by my presence, and handed me an inch-thick stack of papers. "More from headquarters."

"Thanks."

He darted out, and I regarded the flood of new decisions to be made.

It was all too much. Every time we sorted something out, two more crises took their place. How long could we juggle disasters? Seven hundred billion people clustered together in less than twenty farm realities, and more refugees streaming in every day as the walls inexorably closed in.

"You alright?" Ashley asked, seeing my face.

I wanted to tell her that it couldn't be done that we were going to drop the ball but I put on another calm expression. "Oh, sure, just thinking." I thought to say something more, but a sudden tremor vibrated the ground beneath us. It wasn't like the earthquakes that had apparently stopped after the destruction of the First World

Screams rang out from somewhere nearby.

Realizing that something was happening *here* at the same time, she and I leapt up and ducked outside.

"What the freaking hell?" I said impulsively, sighting the threat.

A thirty-foot high serrated saw blade spun rapidly among the tents, sending earth, materials, and crimson flying up into the air as it cut its way through the campgrounds. It looked nearly the same as any common circular metal saw blade - except thirty feet in diameter, and spinning under the power of some strange, glowing, and gigantic tiger-eye gemstone in its center.

This device's appearance also meant that the threats out there had finally worked their way to us.

The saw froze abruptly, apparently caught on something, but the screaming and terrified flight of those nearby continued.

"What do we do?" Ashley asked, looking to me.

My radio was already alive with chatter but I was the closest. Remembering the rapid-response and knowledge-acquisition techniques Danny had taught us, I fought my instincts down and ran toward the giant blade.

Pushing against the fleeing crowd, Ashley and I rounded the last tents and came to the huge gulf the blade had carved in the earth. Debris and gore lay scattered around, and I covered my mouth against the stench. This close, the blade seemed absolutely enormous, and far beyond anything tiny humans might do against it.

It was, however, stuck in a boulder that had chucked up from deep in the ground. A heavy whine echoed out from the tiger-eye engine above as it strained and the blade eked forward through the boulder ever so slightly.

It was going to get through!

Were we under attack? Was something intelligent directing this thing? Or was it some random construct that had no knowledge of us? There was no way to know.

But I did pick up a two-foot wide rock and approach the blade directly, holding stone against metal.

"What are you doing?!" Ashley screamed.

I didn't know, honestly, but there was no way I was letting anyone else die - not after the day I'd had. "If it's caught on a boulder, then other rocks can help pin it, right?"

Wide-eyed, and clearly terrified, she grabbed as large a rock as she could handle from the upturned earth and held it against the stopped blade.

Not everyone had fled from the surrounding area. Those remaining men and women saw what we were doing and ran to help.

"Get the other side!" I shouted. "We have to clamp both sides!"

I heard a dozen or more men and women on the other side clang into us. Eight or nine moved up alongside me even as the saw blade jerked up, finally free of the boulder, and began accelerating its spin.

Immediately, a sideways force threatened to throw us all off, and we were forced to push against one another to remain standing. As for the blade itself "Push harder!" I shouted at the top of my lungs.

A forceful torrent of sparks erupted from every gripped stone, and I had to turn my head away and scream against the fiery pain.

More helpers rushed in. I saw teenagers, parents, old men because we had nothing else, and because simply running away and hoping someone else would handle things was no longer an option for the human race.

The blasting wave of sparks began dimming ever so slightly, and the blade slowed bit by bit as dozens of rocks pressed against metal.

"Keep it up!" I shouted again.

And the blade came to a halt at long last, the whine of the engine above growing to a screech.

There were no cheers. There was only terrified silence.

"What now?" Ashley asked, straining against the effort.

I turned my head and looked around at possible options. Above, I saw several purposeful gaps in the blade, maybe ten or twenty feet up. They were part of its design, and had been invisible while the blade had been moving. A materials dump sat maybe fifty feet away

"You!" I shouted at a scared young woman that stood at the edge of the gulch watching us. "Get that metal pole! Wrap that chain over there around the end!"

Getting my idea, she and several others darted about, building all sorts of chained objects.

The first throw missed, but the second landed a sturdy metal pole right through one of the blade's holes. Shaking hands shoved nails through the ends of the chains and into the ground.

Dozens more obstructions followed, and I ordered heavy rocks placed on each nail.

When the giant saw blade had been practically stuffed with protruding metal and wood, and once countless chains had been attached and weighted down, I finally released those exhausted souls holding stone to metal one by one.

Still wary, we all jumped out of the gulch and regarded the giant blade. It whined still, like a trapped animal now, and we stared in apprehension but it seemed wholly unable to begin spinning again.

"Watch it and make sure it doesn't get out," I ordered those who had first helped, and then I ran toward our headquarters, Ashley in tow.

The building housing our entire headquarters seemed in similar scale to the saw blade, and I was reminded how little we really had here.

 Bursting in, I announced what those within already knew: "The threats have reached us."

Techs were already communicating frantically with several other locations. The banks of computers, and the monitors on the wall, all showed the same thing: danger.

Danny stood watching the blinking red locations with grim eyes. "We're going to have to start forming defense teams. Up until now, we haven't had to fight but that time is over."

"What can I do to help?" I asked.

The hard young man faced me. "As sad as it is, these threats can't take up any of our time. Even if they kill a billion people over the next few weeks, we've got six hundred and ninety-nine billion more to worry about. The people will have to fend for themselves, more or less."

Ashley gripped my hand, encouraging me to say the words on both our minds. "Sounds a lot like how the First World abandoned the rest of you guys."

"That's not fair," Danny responded - but our point had been taken. "I guess we can spare communication resources and information to help everyone band together" He issued a few orders, then turned back to me. "Have you made a decision for the, uh, other matter?"

I set my jaw. "I'm still thinking."

He nodded unhappily. "Okay"

A few minutes later, it was back to the open afternoon air. The sky was blue, the sea of tents was rather beautiful in its own way, and a stilled giant saw blade sat menacingly in the distance. It was the situation in a nutshell, really: I had to get back to work and try to ignore the threats seeping in from other realities. Other people had to handle those.

Returning to my tent, I checked on my sister again, then left her to Ashley's care.

I sat at my desk, facing the growing pile of papers.

"Hello?" A young woman stood outside my tent.

"Yes?" I asked, getting up.

She handed me another inch-thick stack of papers. "Aren't you *him?*"

"Yeah," I replied quietly. "Where's the other guy who used to bring me these?"

"He was in his tent when the Rotator" She looked over at the giant saw blade.

"Oh." I turned back to my desk, numb.

It didn't matter whether I was out there helping with monstrous threats or in here writing on papers. People were going to die either way.

Reminded of the request I'd missed, I got to work, churning through the decisions as fast as possible - anything to delay the bigger question at hand.

Once evening came on, I found myself staring at an empty inbox. Had I actually reached the end of the papers?

No. The girl had returned with more.

Leafing through them to make sure none were critical, I dropped them on the desk and went over to my sister's cot.

"Her fever's broken," Ashley said, looking up at me hopefully.

"Good" I took a moment to wish for her recovery, and then looked toward the exit of my tent. "I need to take a walk, incognito. You wanna go?"

"Sure."

We put on hoodies, drew them low, and headed out into the endless currents of people.

Night was different here. Daytime was full of the work of life; washing clothes, building shelters, moving materials, handing out food, cooking, disposing of waste, managing disputes, watching children but night night was the time where those dispossessed humans coped with the enormous pressures that weighed upon both their minds and their realities.

We found one of the carefully constructed circles of tents that acted as a place for those outlets. Vast as it was, the kinetic crowd made it feel cramped. Hundreds danced to primitive beats emanating from arrays of salvaged instruments. Hundreds more sat around the bonfires, drinking, smoking, and tripping. We found a fire near the edge and sat alongside several conversing men and women.

"You ever danced with a guy from Earth Thirty-Two?" one asked his companion.

The woman laughed. "You're from the garbage world?"

"Wait," he said, confused. "Which one is the one where Beanie Babies are worth millions?"

"Forty-Two."

"Oh, Jesus. No wonder I've been striking out all night."

The woman smiled at him. "It's alright. I don't even *know* my number. Too similar to the other Earths for people to guess. And nobody in this whole damn campground knew there were other realities until it was too late to care, anyway."

He nodded soberly. "Yeah"

I turned my head to listen to another conversation.

"*She's* a fucking monster, if anything is," a new man was saying to his friend.

"Hey, I'm going out with a First World chick now," his drinking buddy replied. "She saved *all of them.* My girl wouldn't be alive now if not for her."

I listened more intently.

"Not all of them!" came the retort. "You know how she did it? Wrecking the whole damn place with portals? Imagine the millions that probably died under crushed buildings, or got knocked around too bad. Imagine the ones that woke up slightly too late, and saw the portals close. There's got to be like a half-billion still left over there, watching their planet get eaten up by that white hole."

The other man took a long moment to finally speak. "Christ. Never thought of it like that."

"You know they're calling her the Double-Edged Sword now, right? 'Cause yeah, she saved some people, but how long do you think it'll be 'til she does that shit to *us?*"

"I I don't know she's done amazing things. I don't think you should talk about her like that."

"It's the End of Days, buddy. Time to take a good long look at those around us. She's killed *millions of people* at least, so she's slated for Hell, if anybody is. You want that around you when the sky caves in?"

At a suspicious glance from the speaker, I got up and moved on - just as a fight broke out between the two former friends.

"I've heard conversations like that all over," Ashley whispered in my ear. "And fights. It's not good."

The next fire hosted an actual portable television set being manually powered by men taking turns on a small crank.

A young guy with bloodshot eyes and a stupid grin turned to us as we looked on in askance. "The signals come in from all over the place now that the walls of reality are like cracking puzzle pieces." He giggled. "It's *Gilligan's Island*, man. He's got friggin' *Gilligan's Island!*"

We nodded, but the show looked archaic, and the main character came off as decidedly foolish. It was not often that I was so starkly reminded that these refugees, while quite similar to us, were not our people. We looked like them, but our history had been wildly different from all the eerily similar Earths inside the Shield. It was as if they'd all been offshoots of one primary world because their denizens could easily define each world by one major difference they all immediately understood. What the hell was a Beanie Baby, and why was it worth millions in one world, and not in the others?

We moved on, hearing many similar conversations. Distractions, pleasures and hatred and awe.

Hatred and awe for humanity's most maligned and feared individual - one Cristina Thompson.

I'd never met her, but I had to put my vote in to decide her fate. I'd been putting it off as much as I could, but time was up. I didn't know her at all. How could I make this choice? All I knew was what everyone had seen or heard about from the Trial broadcast, and then what Thomas, Danny, and Conn had publicly stated in her defense.

They were biased, of course. It was hard to take their statements as fact.

Still, she *had* just saved nearly an entire planet's worth of people.

But that had just added about fourteen billion to the already incredibly stressed refugee population and First Worlders had not been exactly well-liked to begin with.

And she'd made the unilateral decision to wreck the First World's infrastructure and cause the deaths of hundreds of millions of people. That was the scariest part, for me. She'd simply come up with an idea and executed it without consulting anyone else.

There'd been no time for deliberation, sure - but only because her previous idea, also executed without consultation, had apparently destroyed the First World's moon and begun collapsing the inner Shield sooner rather than later.

This was a person who knew more than any of us. This was a person whose knowledge, willpower, and skills had turned her into a veritable weapon of mass destruction. How could *one person* go around saving and destroying worlds? And she'd demonstrated remarkable coldness in the past. Some regarded her as a savior, like they did me - and that scared me, because others regarded her as a demon.

I wanted to understand. I wanted to believe in her, like Conn, Thomas, and Danny did.

Our walk took us back to headquarters, where a new shift had taken over coordinating responses to threats in other places and other realities.

Danny sat in an office chair in a back corner, passed out from exhaustion.

Ashley gently woke him.

He sat up and tried to look immediately official. "Wha, ah - yes?"

"I've got my vote," I told him.

He stood, probably guessing that he wasn't going to like my decision.

I looked to Ashley for support, and she nodded. She already knew my answer.

"I'm sorry, Danny. I have to vote against," I said quietly. "She's a tremendous unknown quantity, and capable of terrifying things. The human race will riot at the best, and split into a civil war at the worst, if Cristina Thompson is allowed to stay."

He seemed intensely defeated. "Alright that's it, then Thomas and Conn are *not* going to like this"

My vote had been the last one given, and the split. I couldn't help but feel that the entire decision had rested solely on me. I was not a leader, nor a decision-maker yet the decisions kept finding me.

An outcry from one of the techs pulled us over, interrupting any conversation we might have had. "Sir, some of our scouts have reported back about the Black-eyed Army. They've got the brownshirts, and they're heading somewhere."

"They've found it," Danny realized aloud. "The access to the main Shield generators"

On *this* topic, we were unified. I immediately got my radio and gave the rallying call. We'd had no idea how to access the main Shield generators, but it was clear that the shadow cell was also looking. Instead of wasting time guessing, we'd simply watched and waited and they'd found it for us.

But it was critical to beat them there, and with enough force to overcome their unknowable litany of exotic weapons and threats. "Take care of Laura," I told Ashley, even as I turned to get my gear.

"Of course," she responded, leaving me with a single worried kiss.

"Sir," another tech interrupted our frenzy of activity. "I'm receiving a broadcast."

Danny froze. "You are? What is it?"

"It's Gilligan's Island."

"What? Who cares?"

"Sir" the tech responded. "Nobody should be broadcasting random television shows. I traced it back to an amber world - a Branch world. It looks like a crack has formed in their little Shield."

"We can contact them," Danny realized aloud. "Maybe use their backup Shield generators" He turned to me. "We gotta do both. Race the Black-eyed Army to the main generators, and reach the amber world's backups."

And there it was - yet another massive and unknowable decision had found me. Something in me had simply given up resenting it. There was no use in worrying about unknown possibilities. "I'll take a crew to the amber world. You guys deal with the shadow cell."

He nodded. "Good luck."

Just like that, we were racing off. Both crews moved together, heading for Thomas' tent, where the still-weak boy hopefully still had the strength to send us off into battle. Whatever happened, I knew the next few days possibly held the final acts of the human race. For whatever it was worth, I intended to make those acts count.

	<TEXT>  I wonder if he couldn't post standalone stories that link back to the rest of his work, or portions of the main story which meet nosleep's restrictions, there. That way he could draw in new readers, while still exploring different directions.

I've definitely thought about this, and I'll probably do something like that. If a series gets too heavy, move it off-subreddit. </TEXT>

Also I would suggest that we somehow link these stories on that sub so people who like the next series can find the other stories in the series.

Probably not these ones, but I will also be writing stories for NoSleep's format.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I would love to know where you get your inspiration

I typically start with a specific feeling, with all sorts of little emotions thrown inside to make a unique mix. For a series like this one, it can be something like abject despair, with bits of guarded humiliation, solitude among a crowd, lost love, and old unhealed pains.  From there, I imagine who might be feeling that emotion, and then why.

That mix I just described was pretty much [spoiler](/spoiler "Conn at the start, so you can imagine how excited and hopeful he felt when he saw Higgins, and the unwanted emotional context of his life up-ended.")

And the monsters definitely come from dreams and nightmares. I've seen most of these in weird ways before I ever think to write them. That, and for these ongoing series that are connected, I've had to create a wide system of behind-the-scenes places and events, so some have naturally resulted from that. This series of series has had strong themes of [spoiler](/s "crystalline/gemstone threats and plant-based threats (for just two examples) for a reason") </TEXT>

But I wasn't going to leave her.

"Cristina?" It was Danny's voice, and oddly defensive. "What's up?"

"I need to speak to Thomas," she said carefully, eyeing the bubbling sky.

A pause followed before the young man spoke again. "He doesn't wanna talk to you."

"Please." She lowered her head, radio in hand.

"We watched that broadcast. We saw what you did. Who you really are."

"I never lied to you," she responded quietly.

He drew in a sniffle. "Yeah, but you didn't tell us the truth, either. There was so much you never told us. That's lying."

"I'm sorry. I don't deserve your forgiveness, but I hope you believe me when I say I have never tried to do anything but protect you since I met you all."

Another voice cut in - I recognized it as the boy I'd taught to skip stones by the water. Thomas had been an introspective and solitary young man when I'd known him, however briefly our meeting had been. Now, his voice was filled with pain. "You were gonna *kill me?* That's why you even came to where I was? I thought it was just random, I thought I was finally - I just thought -"

"I didn't know you then," Cristina replied sadly. I gripped her hand while she spoke. "I was damaged. I wasn't a good person. But I want to make up for that now."

"I read the book," Thomas continued, sobbing. "It didnt say anything about any of that. It just told me what you were thinking at your daughter's funeral."

"You didn't read far enough," she answered. "The book shows you what you want to see. But it did show you what mattered. If I was your enemy, if I wanted *anything* other than to protect you, it would have shown you that."

Danny's voice cut in again. "How can we trust *anything you say?*"

Cristina let her hand drop. She had no answer.

But I did. I took the radio from her. "Guys, Conn here. *I* care about you two, and I know that she feels ten times what I do. She isn't *just* doing what needs to be done. Moments ago, she was ready to die to live up the notion of a *good person.* This woman has been through pain and danger you couldn't imagine here, trying to be the guardian you deserve."

There was a distressed pause. Finally, Thomas spoke. "She has?"

"Yeah," I told them, shouting over rising winds. "You see, the sky is coming apart - the inner Shield collapsing, I think - and half the moon is bearing down on us. We're kinda running out of time here."

"What did you *do?*" Danny asked. "How did you break the moon in half?"

Thomas grabbed the radio back. "What do you need me to do?"

I handed the radio to her, and she wiped her face dry. "I need you to save every single person on this planet."

"What?" he asked, despondent. "How can I do that?"

"The inner Shield won't stop you from getting here. Not anymore. Do you remember how we met?"

A few seconds passed. "Keep your radio broadcasting," he finally said. "I can feel you."

She clicked the button and held it.

Almost immediately, a sharp blue light appeared, and an oval in space widened near us. Beyond, I saw the headquarters building, including Danny and several others. Thomas faced us - and stepped through.

The portal closed behind him.

He ran to Cristina, who hugged him tight for a long moment.

"Are you ready to save everyone?" she asked.

He nodded, and detached. "Will it be just like back then?"

"Yeah."

We all moved quickly down from the roof and out onto the open grounds of the base. I watched as Thomas opened a new portal before us. This one went to an open field somewhere, in what looked like the farm worlds. I eyed the sky nervously, noting the *very* large chunk of moon filling the sky amid rabid white chaos.

"Can I use that?" Cristina asked me.

I looked down, surprised - and then handed her the book that I'd somehow been carrying this whole time.

"Alright," she said, taking a deep breath. She smiled warmly at me, and then at Thomas. "Isn't this what I always say? Use one apocalypse against another?"

Thomas laughed, and she ran toward the portal.

Upon reaching the other side, she darted back to us.

She got to our trembling ground, turned on a dime, and ran back.

The portal suddenly expanded dramatically to a multiple of its previous size.

She didn't stop. Running to us, then back, and then to us again, she brought about another expansion event. I stared. Was the book being taken through the portal repeatedly causing this?

The next few trips caused another expansion, and I started to comprehend what she was trying to do. Small and chaotic portals began appearing all over the place - and, still, she did not stop.

The main portal expanded again and again, collapsing buildings on either side of the base. It began pushing out through trees, and the environs began filling with random portals big enough for a person, all leading to that same farm reality.

And, still, she ran.

"Do it!" Thomas shouted in support, his fists clenched.

Each new expansion made the portal larger and larger, until the top of the main aperture touched the seething sky. It seemed the very fabric of reality itself was coming apart like a melting cloth. I saw city buildings on the horizon collapsing as portals blew through them like paper.

And, still, she ran, back and forth like a deadly pendulum, her eyes grim and her expression determined.

I watched as all sight of the rest of the world was lost. There was only a storm of portals in every direction.

Finally, she slowed, breathing hard. "Heath, what's it look like?"

"Portals have covered the entire planet, and basically destroyed everything," he responded. "It's not pretty. A lot of people dying."

She nodded sadly. "No better way. It had to be done."

"I think you're right. They're going they're all going."

Rising hope surrounded me. I could see it - a safe and lush farm world through every single portal. With the sky boiling and the moon about to crash down upon us, this escape route, however inexplicable it might have been, was obvious. Through the portals around me, I saw the exits of other portals, and people streaming through them on the distant blue horizon.

The portal exits there would destroy the farming machines and systems but that was just one farm world, and a worthy sacrifice, besides.

Fifteen billion people lived on the First World. Cristina's insane plan - built on a strange book, a not-quite-human young man, and the determined will to make a hard decision - was going to save almost all of the First Worlders, whether or not they deserved to be saved.

She fell to her knees, laughing, crying, and shouting for joy all at once. "We just - we just wait 'til the last moment, and then get the hell out of here. Anyone who hasn't gone through that's on them"

Thomas smiled with her, immensely excited.

I was the only one looking as the main portal suddenly went white.

A strange and bland room appeared beyond. A woman sat at an all-white desk at the far end. I noticed first that she wore glasses and second, that she appeared extremely angry.

Confused, I opened my mouth to ask about what I was seeing - but there was no time. An odd fleshy tentacle made of what looked like brain matter moved to the portal and tried to come through.

It failed.

But it didn't give up. A weird long metallic device erupted at the end of that tentacle, and began glowing intently. It occurred to me instinctively that I was able to see it, so light must be able to penetrate back through the portal.

A laser?

It was pointed at Cristina's back.

Something was angry, and it was pointing a laser-like device at the woman who had just devastated a planet with millions of portals. It intended to kill her. I knew this.

Being a soldier, this threat assessment came to me in a split second.

That - and I didn't really give a damn *what* it was. Nothing was going to harm the woman I loved.

I lifted the semi-automatic rifle the last young soldier had given me - and blew away that device with a few furious pinpoint shots. That was what being a soldier was about, I'd always said: years of training and preparation for a few moments of sudden violence. A split second hesitation could cost lives, and I wasn't about to hesitate with my heart on the line.

Startled by the incredibly loud noise of gunfire, Thomas ducked, and Cristina grabbed him and sheltered him while turning around.

She saw what was on the other side of the portal and shouted a fearful warning.

More brain-matter tentacles appeared, producing more laser-like devices - and I shot them, too.

Cristina pulled Thomas up and ran for a different portal. Taking the hint, I leapt into one of my own, meeting the two of them on the other side.

"It's been long enough!" Cristina shouted over the roaring winds. "Shut it down!"

Thomas nodded, squeezed his eyes shut and the spectral blue hurricane shrank in a million places all at once, disappearing with a sudden silence.

Cristina hugged Thomas again, tighter this time, and I joined them. There were no words.

We were alive.

And the horizons teemed with countless displaced, confused, and overjoyed survivors.

We hadn't saved everyone but we'd saved most of them. The First World's knowledge and culture - Cristina's culture, and the culture I had married into - would survive. The Crushing Fist might have still had us in its grip, but humanity would face it together, as one.

Overcome by a fit of amazed laughter at the sudden relief of explosive stress, the three of us fell among the wheat, staring up in disbelief at the calm and clear blue sky. A great many people had lost a great many things, but we'd actually *found* something in enduring hell.

Each of us was part of a family again.

Cristina moved out of the way, eyes wide. "You don't have to do this."

Vasiliev turned in his chair and smirked. "Consider this your forgiveness, though Lord knows if you deserve it. Seems humanity's tale is coming to a close, and I'm finding it hard to hold grudges."

She gulped, processed his words, and then nodded slowly. "Thank you, Vasiliev."

"Ah," he replied, suddenly embarrassed again. He turned away to press preparatory buttons on the pilot's console. "It's nothing. And besides, I don't plan on dying out there, so it's not some brave sacrifice anyway."

"It is though," I said, overcome by his act. "It is brave."

"Get out of my plane!" he shouted, waving his free hand at us.

Obliging, we stepped out, not sure what to feel except hope that he would succeed.

One of the soldiers remained on board. "Sir," he said to Cristina. "He's going to need someone to push the bomb out the back."

She nodded.

He saluted, and the ramp slowly lifted, until it went flush with the back of the helijet.

The engines powered up to full strength, and the radio crackled. "This is going to suck," Vasiliev said. "I take it all back. Nobody's forgiven, and I hate you all."

"Good luck," Cristina replied sincerely.

He sighed. "Thanks."

Cristina, our one remaining soldier, and I watched him take off. The helijet ascended quickly, picking up speed as it headed off toward the glowering white eye on the horizon. The buildings and trees nearby made it hard to see him, and the three of us ran up to the top of a building to watch him soar over the city.

"Oh, shit," Cristina said, seeing it before we did. She grabbed her radio. "Heath! *Heath!*"

"What's up? Everything alright?"

"You have to tell people not to look at the ruby cube!"

"I did!"

"*Tell them again!*"

"I don't have full communications, I'll have to -"

"*Do whatever you have to!*" she screamed.

For the ruby cube had begun to ascend higher, not in response to Vasiliev's helijet, which it dwarfed completely, but in response to thousands of people fleeing the city beneath it. Thousands of people looked up in terror as that cube took up position above them and began to unfold.

I wasn't sure what I'd expected. I'd had some vague notion of it shooting lasers, or teleporting people inside itself to suffocate them, or maybe crashing down on the crowds to wipe them out. I *hadn't* expected that it was going to begin moving and changing. Each of its sides began unfolding in a complex pattern.

It was *opening.*

I stared. It had previously been semi-transparent, or at least had had that appearance. What could possibly be inside it? What was going to emerge from a carved crimson box a mile and a half long on each side?

"*Heath!*" Cristina screamed at the top of her lungs, true abject terror in her voice for the first time I'd ever heard. "*Do anything! Do anything at all! For God's sake, stop people lo-*"

A ringing sound emanated from somewhere next to us. Looking over, we saw our surprised soldier reach down and pull something out of his pocket.

He lifted the cellphone to his ear. "Hello?"

He nodded, and then looked at us. "It's that guy. Heath. He says not to look at the ruby cube and he knows me by name."

Cristina looked forward, watching the geometric crimson pattern refold back into a cube. "Heath got their names from the databases and called every single person every single cellphone at the same time"

His voice came back on the radio. "I don't feel very good."

"Are you alright, Heath? What's wrong?"

"How was I able to do that?" he asked, fatally sad. "Where am I, Cristina? Where am I, really?"

She looked at her radio, subtly mortified. "I'm sorry - I am sorry, more than you know, for not telling you."

"Not telling me what?" he asked, audibly dreading the answer.

I asked for our soldier's radio, and lifted it. "Heath, this is Conn Thompson."

"Hey"

"You just saved all our lives, I think. Thanks."

"Sure" His tone picked up a tiny bit. "That's good"

Cristina watched me as I spoke.

"Keep it together, friend. We're not out of the woods yet, here. Can you focus for a little bit longer?"

"Yeah yes. Yes, I can."

"Alright, thank you. How far is Vas from the white hole?"

There was a momentary pause. "Not far now. He's begun evasive maneuvers to avoid huge radar contacts. They look like huge boulders, or something."

Cristina nodded silently.

We waited, tense, as Heath gave the play-by-play of Vasiliev Blaku's final flight. Apparently, he must have had extensive training, or he was simply desperate enough to fly the big gambles.

"It'll seem like an endless mountain to him," Cristina said quietly. "He can never reach the center, as space is pulling away infinitely there, but he only has to get close. I imagine there are insane ongoing winds, all sorts of dangerous debris being thrown at him, and probably electrical disturbances." She stepped toward the edge of the roof, watching the distant blazing hole in the sky. "There was a pair of sunglasses on the dash. I hope he found them. It's going to get bright, even through the shielded glass."

"He's off the radar," Heath said grimly.

Several heartbeats pounded in my chest before anything happened. We stood, frozen, unable to think or speak for fear of jinxing it. The burned and scarred city dominated the horizon; above that, a searing white blotch; and high above, a golden crescent moon, ever so slightly visible. They often said, here, that crescent moons were lucky. I hoped that they were right.

The tiniest little glimmer of color appeared near the blindingly white blotch.

Cristina looked away instinctively, and the soldier and I followed suit.

We probably should have found shelter - but how could we have thought to hide with so much on the line?

Even at our distance, the blast knocked us off our feet. A brief accidental glimpse showed me one of the charred skyscrapers downtown falling, and the sky in turmoil overhead. The initial glare died down after a moment, and we looked over at the horizon.

More white blotches appeared all over the sky, and several of them raced up, and up, and up, expanding like crazy fault lines through the heavens. Even as we watched, one of them seemed to slice right into that golden crescent -

The moon lit up, suddenly presenting itself through the obscuring glow of the daytime sky.

It lit up - and ruptured in half, slowly and tremendously.

"No!" I shouted.

"Shit! Oh shit!" the soldier next to me roared.

Cristina, too, yelled at the top of her lungs. "Christ!"

"The moon!" I screamed, turning to her. "The - the - the moon!"

"Half of it's getting bigger!" the soldier shouted. "Is it coming this way?!"

The whole sky was falling apart, gold pierced through in countless places by white.

And Vasiliev Blaku was undoubtedly dead.

"It didn't work," Cristina shouted to herself, face alive with panic and turning mental gears. "Holy shit, it didn't work!" She turned to me. "There was too much pressure on the inner Shield - it couldn't rupture outward it's just rupturing inward!"

A great screaming reached us on the wind.

"What do we do now?" I asked, mortified. "There's a portal facility underneath this base we could just go"

"That piece of the moon is *definitely* coming this way," the soldier reported, beginning to hyperventilate despite his calm during the rest of our mission. "Ma'am - er, sir - I'd really like to get out of here."

Cristina nodded at him. "Go for it. Your help has been tremendous. There's nothing else you can do here."

He nodded, and I saw his youthfulness suddenly become very apparent. It hadn't occurred to me that our courageous allies might have been as young as eighteen.

"Here," he said, lifting his semi-automatic rifle and handing it to me. I nodded, put the strap around my shoulders - and he raced off, heading for the entrance to the underground complex that housed the portal machines.

Staring up at the sky as it began bubbling and frothing like a soup made of pure light, she lifted the radio once more. "Heath, are you still there?"

His reply was filled with static at first, but he was.

"Heath, I need to speak to Danny. Can you relay me through?"

"Yes. Hold on."

A few moments passed, and I felt the panic that had gripped our last ally beginning to overtake me as well. Not only was the sky in turmoil - a piece of the freaking moon was falling toward us!

[Part 6](http://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/39vdxw/repost_i_was_told_that_everyone_id_served_with_in/)

We moved against all instinct. We pressed ahead, as a group, *toward* limitless danger. Every nerve in my body - save the ones in my scorched hand - screamed *against* our heading. A righteous holy eye glared down at us from above the horizon, radiating searing white judgment. Every few minutes, successive waves of force pulsed out, threatening to physically knock us to our feet.

It was space itself ripping a bit more.

Ever so slowly, the whining in my ears calmed, and my hearing returned. As we climbed over the debris of shattered buildings, pushed between blackened cars, and eyed the dangers ahead, we were surrounded by the sounds of disaster.

Injured men and women screamed for help from inside collapsed buildings. Scattered people with bright red burns and charcoal-black patches of skin wandered by, begging for assistance. A baby cried somewhere but there was nobody to attend to him.

It was too much for my heart to endure, and I thought of stopping and helping each wounded man, woman, or child we passed but Cristina kept on, her hopeless gaze locked forward, her despair shutting out the cries. I'd never seen her like that before - but I was kept by her side by the knowledge that she needed my support now more than ever.

And over all those sounds, all those pains, and all those despairing emotions, there was one singular unifying roar. The wind, which had been rapid and searing for so many days, had become a constant and slowly rising fiery gale. It was livable out of direct line with the righteous eye in the sky, but the tempestuous winds in some streets painted my exposed skin with the feeling of standing too close to a bonfire. On those streets, it was all I could do to keep my eyes open as we held our arms over our faces and pushed on.

We were a strange sight to behold, I was sure. Me, her, Vasiliev, Ethan, the brigadier general, and Not-exactly Noah were all in nice clothes that had been dust-blasted and torn by debris, and six heavily-armed soldiers surrounded us in a trailing half-circle. Most of the survivors we passed thought that we were heading somewhere safe, and they began following us, ignoring our explanations that we were heading *into* danger, not away from it. They either couldn't hear us, or didn't believe us.

That was the hardest part for me to bear. These people, while in shock, were going to follow us right into the jaws of hell.

As we covered the next few city blocks, we could see the ungodly inhabitants of Teskoy spilling out from the torn space surrounding the distant white hole. Some of those creatures would surely die from the fall, but I imagined the rest would only be made furious and hostile. How many miles away was it? Our military contact had said it was two or three miles northeast of the city, and we were nearing the city's core

The numerous skyscrapers ahead had survived the initial eruption, and now stood like gigantic blackened and smoldering monoliths. Once they towered over us, we would be near the military base - and its vast underground machines that might let us portal to safety.

Cristina's radio crackled as we stopped to endure another wave of force, and she immediately pulled it up and shouted back.

For a moment, I heard Heath's voice but it faded into the same forceful static that had dominated our radios since the white hole had erupted.

"Damnit," she breathed, before turning around the corner of a tall, shattered building - and pulling back abruptly to hide against the wall. She turned her head to us, and spoke quietly. "This is it. Past here, there'll be all sorts of terrors. If anyone wants to run the other way, now's the time."

One of the soldiers with us shook her head, and then adjusted her helmet slightly before speaking. "No, ma'am."

The others wordlessly echoed that sentiment.

The crowd of injured and scared people that had followed us stood silently, waiting for us to lead the way.

I wasn't sure whether it was bravery or desperation, but I was glad for the group solidarity. It felt like being back in the military again, and I'd never felt right after I'd lost that bond. We strange twelve were a squad, and we'd found ourselves on a battlefield, and we had a very clear mission.

"We have to make it seven city blocks," Cristina said, after peering around the corner again. "There's a world of shit between us and that base. I don't know where that ruby cube has gone, either, but I can't see much from here." She looked at me. "Conn, how's your leg?"

I looked down at my black cast. My broken leg had been starting to hurt something fierce from all the use. "I'm alright."

I think she knew that I was lying, but she accepted my answer with a slight smile. "Well, then." She looked around, not just at us, but also at the dozens of followers behind us. "Everyone stick together. Shout out what you observe. Knowledge - and gaining knowledge quickly - is the only thing that will keep you alive through the next seven blocks. These things aren't designed to eat you, or kill you. They didn't evolve with you, and have no idea what you are. So just figure out how to stay out of their way. Got it?"

A sea of heads bobbed with scared nods.

She addressed our armed soldiers. "Guns are an absolute last resort. Not only will they probably not work, they'll attract a ton of attention."

With that, she slipped around the corner. I followed immediately, submerging into a heated horizontal river of blasting air.

Instinctively, I felt my fellows behind and alongside me. All eyes scanned every detail of the rubble and building-lined canyon ahead. Thinking few would look at the same spot, I peered past a series of random debris fires that were starting to die down.

I saw them first, and pointed.

A cloud of them danced among the dying flames - not touching them, but merely floating in their wavy emanations. They looked like orbs at first like bloated seed pods, almost. They were clearly some sort of plant life

As we tried creeping past, they began floating away from the fading flames, and toward us. One of the soldiers batted at one with a fist, and it bounced away briefly, unharmed. They didn't seem obviously dangerous, but Cristina motioned us quickly ahead, her eyes suspicious.

Her concern was proven right when the first pod opened widely near a soldier's face. It had no seeds within. Instead, it expanded and swiftly latched right around his head.

Overcome with alarm, we immediately began hitting them away as best we could, but the swarm continued to grow. Pulling a knife from the belt of one of our soldiers, I gripped the corrugated orb of plant-matter and cut as deeply as I dared.

It came away, and the freed man gasped for air, unharmed.

As we tried to fight the swarms off, a plant pod slipped around Ethan's head from behind, and I leapt to him, cutting it away as quick as I could. "Christ, thanks," he breathed, terrified.

More pods swarmed toward the crowd.

"The fires" Cristina shouted. "These pods aren't big enough to have complex nervous systems. They're either attracted to heat, or to carbon dioxide." She looked back at our following crowd. "The embers of those flames would still be hotter than us hold your breath and run! Every single one of us has to do it or they'll find us - break the carbon dioxide trail!"

I took a deep breath, filled my lungs to capacity, and hurried forward as quickly as I dared on a leg that was beginning to feel like grinding shards of broken glass. Others followed, dragging a few living bodies with spherical green covering their heads. We clambered over a pile of debris and then watched the plant pods swarm about aimlessly, but none of us dared breathe until Cristina gave the order.

Her hand, held high for the run, now dropped, and we all breathed out as one. Our followers cut the plant matter away from their beleaguered friends, and it seemed most of us had made it past the first block.

Four bodies lay in the devastation behind us, green spheres pulsing weakly above their shoulders. I turned away, the heaviness on my heart causing me physical pain.

Blue crystal mounds dominated the debris ahead.

I stared back and forth wildly, looking for the spectral forms I'd seen moving among them from the distance of Teskoy's mountain hideaway. This close, I could see something inside each crystalline mound. High as a man, and wide as a car, the mounds seemed to contain some sort of spinning light and when two lights from two different mounds aligned, the ghostly image of a creature in horrific pain flashed between them at flinch-inducing speeds.

Some of the creatures so illuminated were human and screaming *at us* as they raced by.

"They're still alive," I realized aloud, horrified. "Somewhere"

Cristina's jaw hung low as she breathed hard to recover from her run from the plant pods. Her hard eyes regarded the uneven and blasted landscape ahead. There was no going around - the high buildings and incredible debris had made sure of that. "We'll have to go through," she said after a moment, audibly hating the idea. "Don't get caught between two aligned crystals. You'll end up like those poor souls trapped in there."

"What *is* it?" Not-exactly Noah asked, staring. "What's happened to them?"

"Nobody's ever dared to figure it out," she responded, analyzing possible routes between the blue mounds. "But they do say the human images never fade away. Wherever they are, whatever's causing them such pain they never age, and never die. They'll be trapped in there forever, as far as anyone can tell."

"I've got some C-4," one of our soldiers offered, rather angry at the described fate of fellow humans.

Cristina shook her head. "I don't know what that would do. These crystals behave very specifically right now. We have to get through on their rules, not ours."

She leapt across the invisible line between two of the crystals, and quickly looked around to make sure she hadn't missed one hidden in the debris. A moment later, a spectral man in pain whizzed past, the terror in his eyes clear.

I followed, leaping to Cristina, and then we turned around to offer help to Ethan.

One by one, we leapt from safe spot to safe spot, sometimes narrowly avoiding those aligned lights and flickering images by only a hair's breadth. People tripped, or didn't listen properly, or were simply slow due to shock - and nearly paid the ultimate price for it.

Halfway through the makeshift valley of ghastly blue crystals, a shouting arose from the trailing crowds.

The floating plant pods had picked up the trail of our breathing again.

Cristina didn't even waste a moment with an expletive. "Hold your breath and move as fast as you can!" She leapt forward, and I half-ran, half-hobbled after her.

Forced to hold their breaths, the panic in the crowd behind us was eerily silent. Dozens of people leapt and dove and bolted between the crystalline mounds - and I saw the first man get caught. The passing spectral image of some weird creature brushed his arm, and he was pulled back, immediately turning translucent as his body flicked into the nearest crystal.

In front of me, his image flickered by, his face full of terror at the realization of what had happened to him. He had time enough only to look to me in terrified askance before he disappeared once more. I couldn't even shout that I was sorry without letting go of my breath.

And the green pods were now encroaching on our valley, drawn in by our carbon dioxide trail, but then randomly scattered by its sudden cessation.

My head pounding, my lungs burning, I felt my awareness starting to shrink. I almost leapt forward at the wrong time - and one of our soldiers pulled me back, getting caught in the beam himself. On pure instinct, as the vicious tide pulled him roughly past me, I gripped his still-physical hand and used the backward momentum I already had to pull as hard as I could.

He seemed to splash out of the ethereal blue, his colors and solidness returning. Eyes wide, hand over his mouth to keep from breathing, he nodded to me in horrified thanks - and we kept moving.

Many of us had just made it past the final invisible danger line when a concussive wave from the burning wound in the sky finally hit once more. I fell to the ground, already on the verge of passing out but a nearby soldier was not so lucky. She was the one who had spoken for the group, and I was too weak from suffocation to reach out and save her. The spectral blue took her, and she was gone in an instant.

And, still, we stumbled forward, only daring to breathe once cover had been achieved. Huddling behind a building that had collapsed into the street, we urged everyone else on, partly to encourage them, and partly to remind them not to breathe until they made it to us.

Three more were pulled into the blue crystalline mounds, and four fell from lack of breath, and were soon beset by trailing plant pods.

Staring back, I realized what was about to happen to us. Cristina's masked despair was hidden from the others, but clear to me: she didn't actually expect us to survive this. We would lose a few people each block, with every loss bleeding away our manpower and herd size, until only a handful of the quickest and smartest survivors remained and, then, none at all.

I touched her hand, and she squeezed mine hard in response, her eyes moving to the next challenge ahead.

Several of our core eleven climbed the rubble to get a good vantage point on the intense oddity we faced. It was possibly the most harrowing threat I'd personally seen.

Before us, the street stood empty and clean.

The faces of the buildings flanking the city road were not charred or scorched or even so much as damaged. Shining under the faux sun, cars lined each sidewalk, parked exactly where one might expect. The street itself was free and clear of debris, and the few sidewalk-planted trees did not sway in the heated winds.

"What the hell?" Cristina asked rhetorically, mirroring our thoughts. She looked up to the Sword, who gazed forward without expression. "What do you think?"

"Could be an illusion," he replied evenly. "Or a slow-time bubble." He paused. "Or, perhaps, the extreme convergence of probability. Statistically, at least *some* parts of the city should remain undamaged."

Not-exactly Noah spoke up determinedly. "It could be a small piece of another reality. I've seen patchwork damage you wouldn't believe."

Cristina clenched her fists. "Damnit. We just can't risk it." Her gaze traveled to a nearby alley. "We climb."

Following her lead, we found the fire escape she'd seen, and a long trail of human beings began creeping up it. At each turn, Cristina's hand found mine, and she helped me climb despite the unbearable pain in my broken leg. The vast metal scaffolding groaned under the weight of so many people.

Just before we reached the roof, her radio crackled to life again.

"Hello, can anyone hear me?" Heath asked.

Continuing to climb, she clicked the radio on while it was still attached to her belt. "Heath! What's your situation?"

"I've finally managed to compensate for the unusual interference," he replied. "What the hell is going on over there?"

She helped lift me up to the second-to-last metal grating. "A white hole."

"A *white* hole?"

We clambered up the last bit, pushed through a random wave of force, pulled ourselves onto the roof, and -

"Heath," she asked, breathless and frozen in place. "How many people can you communicate with right now?"

"Anyone with a television or radio, thanks to the systems in place there."

I hunkered down behind a jutting duct, heart pounding. She stood in place, judging the sudden threat in the sky. "Heath I need you to tell everyone you can. Tell them to spread the word."

I'd seen it only briefly, and my glance had been met with that same strange returned awareness. It had just come out from behind the skyscrapers downtown like a curious crimson and angular moon. Not at all concerned with the white hole blazing a few miles distant, it floated past those enormous buildings, dwarfing them with ease. I knew that the tallest building downtown was around five thousand feet tall and the cube seemed to be four or five times bigger.

"Don't look at the ruby cube," she said into the radio, bringing it up to her mouth. "*No matter what happens, don't look at it.* If too many people look at it for too long, we're all dead."

Heath's voice trembled with confusion. "Alright I'll spread the word"

People began streaming up onto the roof behind us, and we both shouted for them to avoid looking at the ruby cube. Doing as they were told, they hid with me, and waited for everyone to gather. As the last few people tried to climb onto the roof, a tremor hit, and the strained fire escape gave way with a sudden shocking squeal. Everyone froze as the sound of crashing metal reached us.

One of our soldiers looked over the edge for a long moment, and then turned to us with a sad shake of his head.

The next building was across only a five foot gap. Judging it manageable, we worked together to pull up as many of the rooftop mechanisms as we could, forming a shoddy but serviceable eight-foot bridge. A dozen men slid it out over to the next roof and held it down while the women and children with us climbed across.

Cristina followed after, and I went next, trying not to look down at the dizzying drop on either side. The odd cleanliness existed in the alley below as well. For a brief moment, looking down when I should not have, I saw the image flicker.

"Illusion!" I shouted. "It's an illusion!"

"What did you see?" Cristina shouted over the roaring winds.

I grimaced, and saved my answer until I reached the other side safely. Only then did I quietly respond. "Mouths"

She winced. That one word had been enough explanation for her.

We held the bridge down as the last few men crossed over. One of our soldiers was last and a massive passing wave of force hit us just as he began crossing. Despite our best efforts, the bridge snapped, and we were forced to watch as he fell straight down into a dumpster filled with soft trash bags. Climbing out quickly, he checked himself for injuries before waving up at us to indicate that he was alright.

"How do we get him?" one of the men asked.

Cristina pulled us away. "He's not fine. It's an illusion."

The men seemed confused and mutely horrified, but they accepted her answer, and we quickly moved on. I tried my best to shake my unwilling visualization of what was really happening to our ally at that moment I'd briefly seen the alley floor and walls coated with eerie yellow flesh that had been filled completely with gnashing spiked mouths

The next buildings had not survived as well as those two had, but we were past the zone of illusion as far as we could tell. Heading down into the building, we traversed dust-blasted hallways, making our way through burnt-out offices and openings that had been punched in the walls.

There were no people no bodies a fact which was not lost on any of us but there was nothing to do about it but remain wary.

We soon found the source of those punched holes in the walls. The street outside contained a vast sea of four-inch thick vines, complete with wide verdant leaves. Even as we watched, one of the vines snapped up and picked a floating plant pod out of the air, pulling it rapidly to a waiting acidic digestion pool. Those oozing purple pools dotted the vine-covered street, and I thought I saw a human skeleton or two spread out along their edges, as if the people that had been dragged in had managed to climb halfway out.

"What now?" someone asked.

"Everyone's exhausted," Vasiliev breathed, leaning against a wall.

Ethan winced and held his sides. "I should have played squash more often. Maybe I'd be in better shape."

Noah's odd twin said nothing as he sat down for a breather.

The brigadier general remained standing, apparently unwinded.

Our four remaining soldiers quietly ditched some of their gear, trying to lighten their loads.

The crowds behind us remained sprawled through the dust-blasted hallways, breathing hard, and waiting to see what we would do. In particular, I watched a mother tiredly bouncing her baby, trying to keep it quiet. Had she and the child really made it all this way? My heart went out to them. "There has to be another way."

Cristina ran her hands through her sweat-matted hair, her desperation finally showing through. "There's no other way. There are no options. Life doesn't always provide a way to survive." She trembled with anger. "Even if we do make it out of here, these people will be the only remnants of my entire world. I might never have felt at home here, but -" She kicked a burnt office chair forcefully, and it crumpled. "Goddamnit! And even then, everything else is just going to be destroyed anyway soon after!"

I hobbled over to her and wrapped both arms around her tightly - even my burnt and bandaged hand. "It's alright." She clutched me back, and I turned her so that I could look past her at all the dirty, exhausted, and fearful faces. "We're halfway there, right?" I asked. She took in a breath, shuddered with a stress-induced half sob, and nodded against me. I drove the point home. "So what do we got? You always told me to logic it out."

She laughed weakly. "I did, didn't I? I should have stayed a teacher."

"Nah, the pay's not good enough," I countered softly.

Her laugh grew deeper.

"Okay, so," I said, fighting my lack of breath to keep my voice steady. "A white hole, burning in the sky, and growing. Crazy hot winds. Intermittent weird force pushing us back. Tremors that are getting worse. Everything from Teskoy spilling out all over. The Crushing Fist focusing here, on the First World. What else? What's good? What can we use, or what have we brought with us here?"

Her breathing slowed as she settled into serious thought. "We've got ten of us, and a couple dozen civilians. Heath on the radio." She glanced over at Ethan's hands, and he looked down, startled. "A book that refuses to be left behind, and" She slowed, her head rising from my shoulder. I let her go, hoping she'd thought of something. "an unusual bomb."

The rest of us exchanged confused glances.

She grabbed her radio. "Heath, you there?"

"Yes. How can I help?"

"Who are you in communication with? Anyone with high-level clearance, or scientific credentials?"

"Quite a few people like that have taken shelter in the nuclear defense system bunkers."

Her eyes lit up. "Heath, I need you to find out if any of them know about the bomb I brought with me to the First World. The military took it away, but I have no doubt they kept it somewhere."

A few minutes passed in silence. It was a strange tradeoff - everyone needed to recover their strength, but the situation outside grew worse with every passing second. We could hear all sorts of strange growls and cries in the streets, and our lookouts reported numerous eerie creatures being grabbed and eaten by the vine infestation. In a way, the illusion-masked mouths and the sprawling vines were temporarily protecting us from the rising tide of horrible threats. We could see the acid pools filling, though, and the vines growing lethargic as their hunger became increasingly sated.

Heath's voice finally came over the radio once more. "I've got a Doctor Evans that says the bomb didn't end up working the way they'd intended. It was supposed to strengthen the Shield, but it only wrecked the world they'd tested it on and, worse, that damage propagated down to a few nearby realities as well as the pressure on the Shield grew."

"Tell him I know that," Cristina replied, visibly hopeful. "The white hole is only happening because of the pinpoint focus of all of the pressure translating down through the Shield system. I *want* to blow a hole in the walls of reality. It might just save us all. Ask him where the bomb is."

Many of us stood, myself included. The idea immediately made sense on a visceral level, and our hearts filled with a new kind of energy.

"He says that might actually work, at least for now. He says the bomb is at a military base outside the city. They'd intended to ship it somewhere distant, but the paperwork hadn't come through yet."

I'd been there. The military had exiled me through that base - and it was in the opposite direction of the way we'd been travelling. Part of me leapt at the thought of heading *away* from the white hole but that base was much farther away. We were three and a half blocks from escape and miles from fighting back against the fate of the world.

"Get these people the last few blocks, and get them safe," Cristina told the brigadier general, her eyes distant.

The massive man nodded, and turned to the crowds. "Everyone, follow me. The vines have eaten their fill, and stopped moving. We're going to get you out of here."

Worried faces donned hopeful smiles.

As the crowds moved out through the shattered wall, Cristina pulled away, and I followed. She ordered two of the remaining soldiers to go with the civilians, and two remained by our side.

Ethan ran after us and gripped my arm. "I don't know when I'll see you again, friend, but I think this is yours."

I took the book from him. "Be safe, Ethan." I sighed. "Buddy."

He laughed. "I knew I'd get ya eventually."

A moment later, he was gone, moving ahead with the crowd. Noah's odd twin, realizing that ours was a job for soldiers alone, went with him.

Cristina, Vasiliev, and I made our way through the building the other way, tailed by our two soldiers. Going out a back entrance, we managed to avoid our earlier encounters. With small numbers and practiced discipline, we slipped through tight spaces and broken buildings, evading all manner of horror in the streets. For a time, I couldn't even feel the pain in my leg. The *mission* was too important, and the hope of actually accomplishing something too strong.

Eventually, we came out ahead of the growing territories claimed by otherworldly entities, and found ourselves treading through streets filled with dazed survivors once more. I thought to warn them, but Cristina shook her head - we couldn't afford to build up a following of confused civilians again, and they would certainly latch onto us if we expressed any authority.

I sighted them first: bikes.

One by one, we each found a working bike among the racks just outside a gym, and the going became vastly easier. It was a bit comical, seeing burly and hard-eyed soldiers riding pink bikes, but our choices had been few.

And I had a chance to ease my leg, using it at a specific angle on the pedals to avoid hurting myself. My burnt and bandaged hand had awoken from numbness with a biting agony, but it functioned well enough to ride.

Heading in our new direction, the searing winds pushed us onward, and the waves of force propelled us. It was almost as if existence was helping us get to where we were going and no threats had reached out that far. Calming considerably, I let myself process the idea that we might actually succeed. The white hole was growing, and would destroy the planet eventually but not in the next hour or two, and that was all the time we needed.

Cristina tilted her head, as if listening to a distant sound. "They made it they actually made it! They just completed the portal journey." She paused. "With twenty-three casualties along the way."

"Huh?" Vasiliev asked. "Oh - Ward? Talking in your head?"

She nodded, noticing how our squad mate had called the brigadier general by his first name. That implied that he had forgiven the Sword, now that the blame for past injustice was hers, and hers alone.

"Ethan? And Noah's twin?" Vas asked.

"They're alright."

I gulped. That was good to know. One other concerned me. "Can you ask him if a woman with a baby made it?"

She looked ahead for a moment. "He doesn't see anyone like that among the survivors."

I swallowed bitterly. How many innocents had to die? How many children would -

"Oh, wait," she said after a moment. "Yes, she's there."

Laughing as we rode, I blinked away the start of angry tears. "Good, good."

"Why?" she asked, riding alongside me.

I glanced over, confused. "Why's it good?"

"I mean like was she someone you knew?"

"Ohhh, I get it. You're jealous!"

"No I'm not," she responded lamely, focusing on steering past some debris to hide her sheepish smile. "Just wondering"

Vas watched us from his bike, just behind. I glanced at him once or twice, wondering what he thought of the woman who had once tortured him now riding ahead of him and acting like a normal person. His jaw was set, but his face was unreadable.

"Nobody I knew," I finally told her. "Was just hoping that she and her baby made it."

She nodded quietly, the momentary lightness between us overcast by the gloomy reality of the situation.

We came to the high residences marking the outskirts of the city, and we passed beyond that wall without much fanfare. Streams of refugees were walking out in endless lines, mirroring the lines I'd seen heading toward the First World on foot during my exile. It was as the Sword had said - as Ward had said - that our walls were pointless. Those inside *and* out would both die the same way.

Out here, as we broached the fresh verdant landscape, it was oddly quiet and peaceful. The high buildings had shielded the immediate countryside from much of the initial blast, and the lands beyond had had enough miles between them and the white hole to survive relatively intact. The waves of force still came at irregular intervals, but were weaker, and the searing winds were merely a warm breeze.

It occurred to me that much of the First World probably had no idea their planet was in direct danger. Had people on other continents even felt anything? Were those in Asia still sleeping, totally unaware that reality itself had begun to rupture?

The military base soon revealed itself among the hills. What had once been scarcely populated was now completely deserted. The layabouts and apathetic soldiers had clearly hightailed it to parts they imagined were safer.

"Vasiliev," Cristina said respectfully, pulling her bike to a halt at the entrance.

He stopped alongside her, his expression carefully neutral. "Yes?"

"Will you take Conn to the medical area and see what you can do for his hand?"

"Yes, I can do that."

She threw a nod at our two soldiers. "You two with me. We'll find the bomb and re-arm it. Everyone stay in contact with your radios."

We rode off in separate directions.

The medical building was small, but clearly marked.

Vas found some supplies, began unwrapping my hand, and grimaced. "You got torched pretty bad."

I clenched my teeth against the pain of the bandages pulling at my frail skin. "Yeah."

"Thanks, though," he said. "We might have been cooked alive if those flames had gotten down to us."

I nodded, wincing as he applied antibacterial cream. The room was painfully silent, and I felt I had to address the issue. "I want you to forgive Cristina."

He didn't stop treating and re-bandaging my hand with fresh gauze. "I can't."

"You should," I told him. "You don't understand what happened."

"I can guess." He found sticky tape and used it to seal the gauze on. "Lots of people lose a daughter, Conn. Lots of people *don't* pursue some sort of misguided vengeance against a giant spider made of corpses, torturing innocent and unwitting soldiers along the way. Do you know what it's like to sit in a hotbox that *you* made? To wither away hour by hour, dying, surrounded by your best friends and squad mates? Knowing that they can't do anything to help you, because it's that very brotherhood that is doing it to you? At *her* order" He shuddered. "She shot a guy, Conn. When Daniels was reading from that book, when she was stitching herself up she fuckin' shot a guy. Didn't give it a single thought. She's sharp, and brutal. She's a weapon - a human weapon."

I frowned unhappily.

Vas let out a deep breath. "Ward Shaw is not the Double-Edged Sword. *She is.*"

"That's not fair."

"Oh yeah?" he asked. "I wonder if there's an ounce of humanity left in her. She's lying to you as we speak."

I stood abruptly.

The orders had been so smooth, and my training to receive orders so ingrained, that I hadn't even questioned her decision.

Ignoring the crunching in my leg, I ran out of the medical building and across the grounds, Vas alongside. A helijet was already loudly primed and ready to launch, and Cristina and the two soldiers were loading a black-and-metal dodecahedron into the open ramp at the back. That object was unmistakably a bomb, and there was no doubt in my mind that my ex-wife had intended to launch without us.

Hobbling up to the ramp, I faced her with blazing ire.

She didn't look at the other three men with us when she gave the order. Standing halfway up the helijet ramp, she looked only at me. "Give us a moment, guys."

Vas and the two soldiers moved off to a respectable distance, which wasn't far, given the latent whine of the helijet engines.

"You were going to launch all on your own, weren't you?" I asked.

She kept watching me for a moment. "There's no sense in all of us dying."

"Dying?"

"We've gotta detonate the bomb as close to the white hole as possible," she said. "Someone's gotta fly out there and drop this thing from above. All sorts of random pieces of the planet are being pulled in from damaged realities, so it's going to be spitting out chunks of mountain, ocean waters, magma who knows."

I took a step closer, putting my foot on the bottom of the ramp. "I don't care."

"There's a sea of horrible threats between us and there," she continued. "All the airborne ungodly monsters from Teskoy, and the ruby cube, to top it off. People were told not to look, but that's not gonna last. They'll get afraid, they'll get distracted, or it'll fly too close to the survivors leaving the city"

I stepped another foot up the ramp. "It doesn't matter."

"And when the bomb itself goes off, I have no idea what will happen. I don't know if flying high will even do anything. If the bomb works, and the inner Shield fractures, the white hole will go wild before it dissipates if it even does. Anything out there is in for a world of chaos."

My last step brought me right beneath her, looking up at her face. "I'm staying with you until the end."

She grabbed me then, her unrelenting hardness finally giving way. Against my cheek, I felt tears running down her face, marking a pain deeper than what she'd felt earlier that morning when humanity had betrayed itself with celebration and revelry instead of a surging will to fight. "Conn don't you get it? This *is* the end. The story's coming to a close. Humanity's tale is over. Even if we stop the white hole here, even if we somehow saved everyone on this world, the Crushing Fist has us dead to rights. We're almost out of time and we don't even know who's doing it - we don't even know *who* is attacking us!"

I sobbed, too, at her words. The hourglass of humanity was a physical, tangible thing now, as the sands ran low. The last moments would go quickly, as last moments tended to do. "It still doesn't matter. It's not in me to leave your side."

She gripped my arms, her face contorted with pain, tears, and regret. "I hate you for being you," she sobbed. "I wish that you'd screw up or do something mean or dumb, so I could justify trying not to think about you for the last five years. It was only ever you, and I couldn't feel anything else alone. Nothing else ever mattered, nobody else ever mattered. It was only ever me, you, and Laura. Existence is harsh and uncaring, but *we* were *ours.* Our family was our reality, and nobody could take that from us. And they still can't." She pushed me back forcefully, her face red and streaming. "I'm still in love with you, asshole, and that's why you can't come with me. I need you to live, so that any of this matters. I don't want to go back to being the monster I was when nothing mattered."

I stood in place, dumbfounded. There was only one thought on my mind. "I still love you, too. Which is why I can't stay here while you go off alone."

"Oh come off it," Vasiliev shouted, sounding rude on purpose out of embarrassment. "I can fly a helijet, you jerks. Get out of my goddamn way." He shoved past, heading for the pilot's seat. "And I'm far better at it than a civilian contractor, I bet."

Coughing with awkwardness, the two soldiers came over and helped carry the bomb the rest of the way into the craft.

---

Our makeshift fort had been burnt and melted into permanence. It didn't fall over even after people let go. I slowly unclenched my hand, at first hopeful that it was working at all and then I looked at it, and felt a dark pit grow in my stomach.

Eyes full of concern, Cristina tore some of the nice shirt Ethan had given her and wrapped up my hand.

I could only stare in shock. It reminded me of hot dogs my father had once left on the grill too long at a Fourth of July cookout when I'd been young

*Come on*, she mouthed, and I followed after her, mentally numb.

The room we'd taken shelter in had been charred blacker than my hand.

The housing project had gone from ten stories to one - the first floor, where we'd hidden, was the only one left.

Jumbled devastation ran in every direction - piles of shattered lumber, broken bricks, and burning refuse. A few unlucky people lay in the streets, seared into the pavement and still smoking. Nearby, the doors to the heavy building we'd initially tried to seek refuge in had been sealed shut by piles of debris. Cristina directed some of our soldiers to hurry over and unbury them.

I just stared around at the destruction, before coming nearly full circle and looking up.

A second sun burned in the sky, brighter than the first.

It hovered in place, exuding eerie waves of distortion, sending the sky running away from it in every direction. All this I saw in a split-second, because I dared not look directly for fear of being blinded.

What I *did* see woke me from my state of shock as my soldier training kicked in.

Shapes moved on the horizon, and among distant rubble.

Many of the well-designed skyscrapers at the core of the city had survived mostly intact, if charred and ugly beyond recognition, but the sight just beyond them chilled my soul right where the explosion had previously burned it.

A gigantic ruby cube, perhaps two miles across on each side, floated up into sight.

I grabbed Cristina, and she turned to me.

*Teskoy,* I tried to pronounce without being able to hear myself. She narrowed her eyes, and I spun her around and pointed.

If we were going to make a run for the military base back in the center of the city, it was going to be a hell of a mission - the white hole's eruption, and the inner Shield's failure, had just dumped a thousand years of agitated threats right into a city filled with devastated and defenseless people. We'd have to cross all of that if we just wanted to save ourselves, and the thought of saving any more than that an insurmountable task, in the face of the nightmare that had descended upon the city.

*What do we do?* I asked her as she turned to me with pained eyes.

She just shook her head.

I gripped her arm tighter with my working hand. *What do we do?*

For the first time in all the years that I'd known her, she truly had no answer.

Our gazes followed hers to the sky. The gold was still there, but the white was harsh, bright, and searing. The sirens kicked into full gear, their eerie call drifting loudly over the city. The partiers filling the street slowed stopped and looked up.

We all understood at the same time.

There was no time to prepare. There were no plans, no last-minute heroics, and no options.

The end of the world was *now.*

Vas was the first to ask the obvious question. "What do we do?"

His answer came in the form of a great tide of terrified screaming. The party was over. Men, women, and children swarmed in various directions in mindless terror, desperately seeking boltholes in which to hide from some great unknown but approaching destruction.

Heart pounding, I waited, and looked to Cristina - as did the rest of our makeshift squad.

She grabbed the radio and raised it close. "What's your name, soldier?"

"Parker, sir," he replied, nervous. "Ryan Parker."

"Ryan, I'm going to need you to focus, and make every single second of the next hour count. You hear me?"

His voice quavered. "Yes"

"Now, you've got everything you need at your station. There are country-wide systems in place to prepare against a nuclear attack - hardened communications, bunkers, warning systems, and the like. Now all you have to do is turn them on, okay? And pester anyone you can reach to do the same. Yell at them. Lie to them. Promise them beers. It doesn't matter. Wake them up and get them active."

"Okay," he replied, reassured by her calm tone. "Sir."

"One more thing - do you have a location for those EM bursts?"

"Um, yes, one second." We waited, breathless. "About two or three miles northeast of the city."

Cristina looked up at the sky, judging. "Alright. Send out that location data through all the emergency channels. Tell people to get as far away from there as they can." She looked around at the streaming panicked crowds. "And ask them to do it in an orderly fashion, if that'll make a difference."

Even as we looked around in fear, a giant television screen on the side of one of the nearby buildings went black, pre-empted by the emergency channels - and then basic green text appeared, recounting what she'd just said.

"Alright. Let's go."

Ethan moved closer. "Where to? I do have a safehouse, but it's on the other side of the city."

"What about using the vortex machine to portal back out?" Sort-of Noah asked. "Let's get the hell out of here."

She shook her head. "We'd never make it there in time. We have to find somewhere and hole up. It may blast out exotic radiation initially, so we have to avoid exposure."

Adrenaline pushing at my senses, I grabbed her hand and started moving, trusting the others to follow. "I know this city. Follow me."

Navigating the rushing torrents of panicked people was the hardest part. Huge groups swarmed this way and that, desperately running after any suspected inkling of safety. Many of them saw our six accompanying soldiers and figured we had a good destination, so they started following us.

I felt on the edge of panic myself. It was hard not to broach that line, and I danced with the idea of losing it and freaking out every step of the way. My brain kept wanting to guess at potential explosion scenarios - but I had to keep telling myself that I had no idea what it would actually look like. I had to lead everyone to the safest spot I knew.

As the tall buildings of the downtown area began receding on the skyline, I knew we were nearing our destination. My panic lessened even as the sirens echoed louder in the open air. 

The thick foundations of several very large but cancelled skyscraper projects had survived many earthquakes without damage, and we turned the last corner as Cristina's radio crackled to life with a familiar voice.

"What's going on in there?" a friendly but worried male voice asked.

"Heath?" Cristina shouted, using one arm to speak into the radio and the other to push screaming people out of the way. "How're you reaching us?"

"Noah Two set up a connection, and I've been working on getting into systems over there ever since," Heath responded. "Everything just went crazy!"

"The First World's about to be destroyed," she replied loudly - and several of our accompanying soldiers looked surprised. She looked to them for a moment. "We might survive the initial blast, but after that, the white hole won't just go away. We'll try to live through the eruption, and then make a run for the base and portal out of here."

"*What about all these people?*" a soldier shouted, looking around in horror.

Mothers and fathers ran past carrying their children. Cars honked loudly at one another, but none moved. Larger men pushed their way through the crowd in a state of panic. A seemingly-abandoned young girl stood on the corner and cried, but I had no way of knowing if her parents were around. Over it all, a blanket of eerie unhearing descended - the sirens, seeming to deepen their mortified whine as the last grains of sand in our hourglass drained away.

Cristina took all this in, like I did, and forced herself to look away. "There's nothing we can do"

"Can your Black-eyed Army help?" Vasiliev yelled, his face temporarily conflicted with the instinctual resentment and anger he held toward her for all her long-ago tortures.

She shook her head, and then spoke at the top of her lungs just to be heard. "Their possessed halves were always difficult to control, but the Sword hasn't been with them for quite some time. They're running on their own agenda now."

Slowing our dogged advance through the crowds, I caught sight of the heavy metal doors to the bunker-like building foundations.

People were spilling out as quickly as they were entering - the building was full to the brim.

*No good,* I motioned to my squad.

Cristina put her radio right up to her mouth. "Heath, do you have maps of the area we're in?"

"Already on it," he responded. "You're a half-block away from -" His words cut off as crackling interference rose to a crescendo.

*Shit!* Cristina mouthed, before pointing at the nearest building - a dilapidated housing project.

We ran.

I broke the door in with a charging shoulder impact, and we forced our way inside even as I felt an incredibly strange sensation surging *through me* like an ocean tide on its way out - it was as if space itself was stretching.

And it was. I misjudged a step and almost fell. The walls pulled away from us in a surreal semi-optical-illusion, and the ground shook with a vast kick. Wordlessly, using military hand gestures, we directed each other - and our swarm of terrified following citizens - to pull up mattresses and anything else they could find to form a makeshift fort near the building's core wall.

I crouched down behind, crushed in with dozens of other people. Cristina held my hand with a fierce white-knuckle grip, and we squeezed down as hard as we could. The makeshift wall of debris wasn't much, but I'd seen documentaries, and even just a single layer could protect from the initial lethal radiation.

The tide inside me shifted the other way suddenly, and I felt thrown against the wall by the sheer change in the elasticity of space itself.

She and I looked each other in the eyes for a moment. Was that it? Were we going to -

The ceiling and walls above suddenly grew alive with eddies of fire, and I instinctively pulled the top edge of the mattress down hard to make a seal with the wall.

A swift punch to the lungs followed, in the form of torrential winds blasting through our huddled mass. The roar was preceded only by the sound of countless windows shattering, and then a screeching note blanked out my hearing. I could see huddled families screaming, but by what light I was seeing our shadowed enclosure, I had no clear idea. I couldn't tell if the earth was shaking or whether it was the insane winds against the building, but it didn't matter - there was nothing to do but pray.

Pray - and hold on to the mattress above me. The heat in my slightly exposed hand became unbearable, and I thought I could feel my skin melting but to let go would have been unthinkable. With my free arm, I only gripped Cristina's hand harder. She seemed to instinctively understand what was happening to me, and she tried to take whatever part of my pain she could.

A slow ebb in the maelstrom crept up on us, until a moment of true calm and silence fell.

Cristina yelled something, but I could only hear that screeching ring in my ears.

Fortunately, the huddled soldiers and families were too deep in shock to get up. The devastation was not over - it was merely changing direction.

The hurricane winds picked back up, surging back the other way to fill in the air pressure void left behind by the initial eruption. The air was still searing, but my exposed hand had gone quietly numb. I didn't dare do anything but hold on until the ghastly winds finally slowed for a second time.

This time, people knew the explosion was over, and they began peeking out. Talking didn't work at all, as everyone had been temporarily deafened, and we began using hand signals to direct those at our edges to slowly exit.

Bailiffs moved to intervene - our cue to leap up and get rough. Despite our lawyers' protests, Vasiliev, the Sword, and I leapt up and began grappling with them.

"With the whole world watching, and more, let me tell you. The pressure outside is *crushing whole realities* despite the outer Shield still being maintained by a skeleton crew of lonely guardians who have been abandoned by the heartless First World military. All that pressure is translating down *right to us, here.* That heat you feel?"

The camera crews surrounded her, looking up with reverence and awe.

"That heat you feel is the strain of ancient machines trying to keep our reality from imploding. They're going to fail, and they're going to fail hard. Do you know what a black hole is? It's when space is pulled down to an infinite degree, and nothing can escape. Everything is pulled in and destroyed."

The courtroom went silent. All motion stopped as humanity waited for her zealous words.

"Well that's not gonna happen here," she yelled, eyes afire. "Quite the opposite. When that built-up force finally penetrates the golden Shield - through a small hole, the tiniest of breaches - it's not going to pull space *down.* It's going to push it *up*, and in. It's going to lance through with tremendous force, and a white hole is going to erupt right into our front yard."

She looked around, as if gazing through the walls. "And probably near here, considering the number of military bases that have drilled through the Shield for so long."

"A white hole?" a reporter asked quietly, eyes trembling. She held up her microphone.

Cristina glared down. "Where a black hole pulls everything in, a white hole pushes everything away. A black hole's singularity center can't be escaped - a white hole's can't ever be reached, and space will stretch right under us, pushing everything away with forces even light can't overcome. Once it forms, it's too late. Game over."

The courtroom remained silent.

Daniels looked at each of us, his expression haunted. After a moment, he opened the book. "Tell me what she was really thinking just now." His eyes scanned the page.

The camera crews turned and focused on him.

"Oh my God," he breathed. "She's not lying."

As if punctuating his words, the ground gave a little tremble - a minor earthquake, brought on by the very crisis that 'scientists' seemed to be conflicted over.

He walked over absently, handed us the book, and paused a few more steps down the path between the onlookers behind us. They waited, stunned, for his words.

He looked at everyone in the room in a sweeping arc, an obvious question in his eyes. After a full circle, he let it free. "Well who fucking cares about *this*, then?"

Everyone in the courtroom looked in askance at the people around them.

Daniels ran for the door, tearing off his tie as he went.

The camera crews raced after him.

A great commotion erupted in the room, and a crashing wave of confused and angry shouting rolled in from the crowds gathered outside the justice building.

The judge stood and hurried out a back door.

The bailiffs, confused, went after him.

The watchers behind us began getting up and talking loudly over one another. Ethan's hand gripped my shoulder. "A fine show, friend. I suggest we all leave while we can."

Realizing that I was free on account of the justice system dissolving before us, I jumped up and ran over to my ex-wife.

She sat in the witness chair once more, her gaze distant, and her expression sorrowful. "Do you think Thomas will forgive me?"

I put the pieces together. "You met him because you were looking for him!"

She nodded, her eyes slightly misty. It was the most I'd ever personally seen her tear up. "That's the thing the legends do say how the brownshirts helped build the Shield. They're energy beings, really, and quite benevolent. They gave of themselves to imbue the Shield with permanence."

"What do you mean?" I asked, helping her stand.

"They gave their lives," she said quietly, barely audible over the growing commotion. "That's why I had my men searching for them. We had to do whatever it took. Great, if the brownshirts were willing, but if they weren't"

I stopped halfway to Vas and the Sword. "You were gonna kill them."

"And *they* still plan to," she said, choking on her words. "They were gonna take Thomas, and I put all that in motion. I was behind that *I* was going to kill him if necessary, until I met him." She turned her pained brown eyes to me. "I was so angry when Laura died. I I was brutal, and violent, and filled with rage. You heard me, heard my thoughts, back then. You know what I did."

I looked over at the friends urging us forward. "Come on, let's get out of here."

"You don't think less of me?" she asked, truly vulnerable for the third time I'd ever seen in my life. The first had been at our daughter's birth the second had been at her funeral.

I actually laughed. "I don't care what you did. You and I could become Queen and King of Evil, and I don't give a shit. My place is by your side."

She gripped my arm. "You're the best man I've ever met."

"Nah," I teased as we ran forward. "I'm not smart or rich. Loyalty's the only thing I got goin' for me."

Ethan, Sort-of Noah, Vasiliev, the Sword, Cristina, and I pushed through the confused crowd as a group. We weren't dressed as convicts thanks to Ethan's fine clothes, and even our lawyers lost us in the milling riot. We slipped between those vast wooden doors and across the chaotic cathedral-like space beyond, finally reaching freedom proper.

A monstrous ocean of people waited outside - a stormy sea, worse than the one in the courtroom. Some people recognized us as we pushed through, but there was no directing the chaos. Once surrounded, we realized what was happening.

The people were partying.

Music had erupted in multiple locations, and beers and drugs were being passed around. I saw Important People from the courthouse among them, drinking and smoking with the poor.

"What's happening?" Vas demanded of one suited socialite. 

The richie looked at him with surprise. "It's the end of the world, kid."

Cristina leapt forward, furious. "We have to *fight!* Not get drunk and high!"

A poorly dressed homeless man nearby laughed. "For what?"

"For the world!" she exclaimed. "To save everyone!"

"Why?" a poor woman asked. "What's the point?"

I jumped into the argument. "To live? To have families?"

"I'm divorced," the homeless man shot back. "Like everybody is."

The poor woman nodded. "Single mom here. I don't know anybody whose family lasts anymore. And besides, raising kids in poverty is pointless. They'll just suffer."

The richie laughed. "And even if they had money my life is pointless, too. I hate every minute of it. Let it end, I say. It's like being released from prison."

Watching that same mentality throughout the huge crowd, we all stood in abject horror.

Cristina gripped my arm tighter, her cheeks screwing up as actual tears ran down her face at such a monstrous and apathetic betrayal. "The government's fallen apart. The military gave up. The people themselves are celebrating oncoming death. Has the human race gone insane?"

I held her close for a moment, shaking my head. Until I'd found Higgins and trailed my way back to the woman I'd always loved, I'd been in that exact same mindset. I'd hated *the system itself*, which had become far too large for any individual life to matter, and I'd wanted it all to fall apart. I would have been drinking and smoking with everyone else here they weren't insane. They were just existentially exhausted.

Our mission here had been doomed from the start. Humanity had fragmented, in this latest era, into a million little shards of ideology that all hated each other and they'd been kept together only by an exploitative system that ensured none of those shards could ever matter or change things. They hadn't even been able to agree that the world was warming *while the sky was turning whiter.* The concept of humanity *banding together* was now as impossible and alien as the things I'd seen in Teskoy.

But I couldn't tell her that. I just sighed.

We had no choice but to keep moving. We thought we were home free until six men in military uniforms found us right beyond the other side of the ocean of people.

The six men approached, stopped short and saluted. "Sir, what are your orders?"

We looked among ourselves, confused.

"Ma'am," the lead soldier said. "Excuse my frank talk. You seem to be the only one 'round here that gives a shit. And knows what's goin' down besides. Far as we're concerned, you're in charge now."

Surprised back from the depths of despair, Cristina stepped slightly forward. "How many men do we have who feel the same?"

He looked to his comrades. "Um, us six, and a couple more scattered around the city."

It wasn't much. That made twelve of us. We began moving deeper into the city, passing by rivers of mad party-goers.

"That'll do," she said, recharged by finding out that not *all* of humanity had lost hope. "Get on the radio. Tell someone to get to the nuclear warning systems. We're going to treat the initial white hole eruption like a potential nuclear attack - and we've got systems to prepare for that, right? Have them turn on the sirens once they detect anomalous EM bursts in the Shield's upper band. That'll be our only warning it's about to fail. Maybe half an hour."

He nodded, and then barked some orders into his radio. He looked up a moment later. "Parker's at one right now. He said he'll -"

The rising whine of sirens cut through the noise of the parties all around, echoing from high buildings and filling my heart with dread.

"Not already," Cristina told our new allies. "Tell him to wait until -"

"I'm detecting EM bursts *now*," the radio responded. "Have been for three or four minutes."

"No" Cristina breathed, looking up at the sky. "*No!*"

"So the rich girl says to her friend, *nobody will know who broke it,* and she *means it.*" I shook my head. "I'm the friggin' bodyguard. I'm standing *right there.*"

Her back against grey brick, her legs stretched forward, her arm hanging idly through the bars, Cristina gave a small but genuine laugh. "What're you, invisible?"

Lounging on the floor and leaning against the bars opposite her, I threw up one hand. "That's what I kept asking myself! But they just get so used to you being around and quiet, they forget you're even there."

For a moment, the humored look she gave me reminded me of the woman I'd known so many lifetimes ago. Her cheek tilted up slightly, as if she was about to speak from the heart for the first time since I'd found her again but a sudden tremor broke both our good mood and our boredom.

Over in his cell, Vasiliev stepped up to his bars. "I'm all for the plan, but it feels like we're running out of time. I thought you said he was going on the stand this week?" He looked across the hall with enmity.

The brigadier general simply remained sitting in his cell. He hadn't spoken all week.

"There's been a few developments," a new voice added.

I looked over. At first, I just saw the suit, and then the lanky frame beneath. As I stood, I found a familiar but grim face approaching. He stopped outside my cell.

"Noah?" I asked, wondering how he'd gotten back into the First World.

"Not exactly," he replied. "But it was easy enough to come here, since the soldiers at the drop already recognized me. While you were busy at the prison, I was setting up a connection out." He held out a stack of bound papers. "They're hoping you have some advice or insight."

"On what?" I asked.

"Almost immediately after you sent the brownshirts back to the refugee headquarters, they were attacked."

Cristina stood abruptly.

I gripped the bars, my thoughts leaping to all of the people I'd met there. "By who? The First World military?"

"No. They had no uniforms, but they were highly trained. They seemed to have had an op planned and ready to go, as if they'd been watching and studying us for some time." He paused to turn around and give my ex-wife a distant and haunted look. After a moment, he seemed to pull himself away from some dark thought, and he turned back to me. "They disrupted our infrastructure there, took down security, and knocked out many of the brownshirts with an unknown gas-based weapon. Then, by witness accounts, they escaped with numerous captives through some sort of black spherical portal."

Cristina joined me in gripping her bars. "Thomas?!"

My thoughts went to that quiet young man as well, and my heart, too, but my attention seized upon the possible meaning of the black spherical portal.

"They don't have him," Not-exactly Noah said grimly. "But a rather large number of children were hurt or killed in the attack. The gas knocks out brownshirts, but it *kills* normal people. It looks like they were specifically after him and he was in a children's area, of sorts, at the time."

Taking the stack of papers I'd been offered, I leafed rapidly through the reports until I found the casualty lists. My eyes stopped dead on the name *Caleb.* Was it the same young boy that I'd met? There were duplicate names in this list, and many were missing last names "Who would do such a thing?"

"They were hoping you'd know."

Fighting an unhappy moisture in my eyes, I shook my head. Why? *Why?* I'd lost Caleb and his mother in the crowd, because I'd turned away for just a moment. Just like a single lapse in attention had cost me so much so many years ago, a single tipped fulcrum - a simple moment in time gone one way instead of another - had sent a dagger through my heart once more.

I had nothing to offer. I had no idea who they were. In the cell adjacent to mine, but out of sight, I heard no move or sound from the brigadier general. Vasiliev, however, narrowed his eyes. "Out there, somewhere, there's an entity we called the Preacher. It had the ability to convert nine percent of any group, rounded down, into fanatical followers. That might be who they are. I have no idea where to find them, though. If that black spherical portal is what I think it is, they could be operating from anywhere."

He was right. I'd read it in the book.

"That's disappointing," our visitor said, subtly angry. "I think the people that attacked us, whoever they might be, are extremely dangerous. There's been mentions of someone or something following the brownshirts for quite some time, and a group of us were entranced, interrogated, and left to starve recently by some unknown force that wanted to know where humanity had gone. I think they are one and the same. Evidently, though none of us cracked, they still found us." He lowered his gaze. "And I have a strong suspicion they're the same people who brainwashed me and made me do terrible things for years."

I stared at his face, noting his despairingly honest expression. He'd had no reason to tell me about such personal pains, except to connect the dots on the evils these unknown men were capable of and he likely expected no response on his individual suffering but I still reached out and gripped his forearm. "You're okay now, though, right? You're free."

He gulped, unable to verbally confirm my reassurance.

"Then you're your own man now," I told him. "I lost everything once, and it was probably all my fault."

Cristina looked away as I spoke.

"But," I continued. "I'm still here, and I can *do something.* It might be small, and it might not help at all in the long run, but I am not nothing - and neither are you."

"Yeah," he replied quietly. "I can try to make up for what I've done."

"No. Forget making up for anything. Just move forward."

The five of us stood in silence for a long moment, with nothing but the howl of the heated winds outside to punctuate our thoughts.

I pulled back into my cell and began reading through the papers, trying to completely understand the attack that had been perpetrated upon us. Who else knew about the nightmarish Sphere that Higgins, Vasiliev, and the brigadier general had encountered in the desert years ago? I glanced across the hall at Cristina, who was asking detailed questions of our visitor.

What had the Sword been doing all this time? He still sat in his cell, gazing at the wall. Higgins and Vasiliev had both run for their lives, been found and helped by 'rebels,' and then slowly made their way to the First World with nothing. I'd sort of implicitly assumed the survivors of that operation had all done the same, in one way or another but the brigadier general did not seem the type to wander homeless.

And Cristina how had she survived? Where had she been all this time? She'd deftly avoided any talk of her past, something I'd assumed was related to the enormous loss we'd shared, but now I wasn't sure.

I'd been pursuing this mysterious trail until my disastrous attempt to fight the Sword had left me wounded and broken. I'd come so close to an answer I could feel it out there, somewhere in the world, waiting for the pieces that I already had to find some new and electric way to fit together.

If the book had just worked when I'd tried to use it on the brigadier general, I would already know the truth but *why* hadn't it worked?

Was there any mention of that book in these papers? I scanned through them quickly, finding nothing. Curiously, I did find mention that one of the attackers had lost his facemask, and he'd had pitch black eyes

Hearing someone new approach, I quickly hid the stack under my sheets.

"Well who do we have here?" a youthful and cheerily sarcastic voice called out. "Conn Thompson, the man who just can't die!"

Looking down the hall, I saw another suited man walking up. It was Ethan, bearing a wide grin.

"What are - uh, to what do we owe the pleasure?" I asked, trying to be polite.

"I was there with you when they sent you off into exile," my old employer said brightly, subtly eyeing a guard at the end of the hall until the latter turned away. "Only seems natural I should visit when you do the impossible and come back from the doomed lands." He laid his gaze on each of us one by one, including Not-exactly Noah, but he said nothing to any of them. Turning to me, he lowered his voice to a whisper. "So what's *really* going on out there?"

My companions all silently watched me for a cue. Ethan was a richie, but his secretly smuggled gift had been intended to save my life, and it might have just done that. I didn't think he could be a spy for anyone, either, given the sad and apathetic state of well, everyone. I sighed. "Six hundred billion people are out there seeking safety, and more are coming in every day."

"Will they find it?" he asked, his cheer suddenly gone. "Safety, I mean."

I glanced back at the window, where the golden-white sky - tending hard towards white, now - raced by.

He caught my unspoken meaning, and ran a hand down his face soberly. "Well, then. I'd guessed the dreadful change in the weather wasn't a good sign." He pulled a cigar out from inside his jacket, lit it, and took a deep pull on it. "So that's it?"

None of us said a word.

He took our meaning. "Wow. Fun stuff. For sure." His gaze seemed lost for a moment, and his fingers trembled around his cigar. He took another long drag before speaking again, his demeanor completely swinging back up. "Don't be so tense, friends! Haven't you heard? They've got a book that can force the truth out of anyone, and you all are going to be the first live subjects!"

I'd wondered about the book's whereabouts after they'd seized it from me. But what would happen when they used the book on the brigadier general? I'd told Cristina what had happened, but she hadn't said much. It would certainly be a horrible surprise if, intent on the truth being revealed, we actually got everyone in the courtroom murdered by a rampaging black-eyed monster.

Cristina finally spoke, replying to Ethan. "Good. That's what we're here for."

"Oh, but that's not the fun part," he shot back. "The narrative has changed, because somebody recognized someone, and then somebody else went digging in old files." He approached her cell. "Seems they threw you off the edge into Teskoy proper, thinking you were nobody important. But blowing up a prison facility and drawing all that attention did the obvious it caught somebody's eye. They realized that you were all there together, five years ago" He let his words hang in the air. "Didn't you know? You're all terrorists now."

"It doesn't matter," she said flatly. "The truth will be told."

"Maybe, but appearance still matters," Ethan said. He turned to shout down the row. "We're ready now."

We watched, confused, as the guard lurking at the end of the hall came down and began unlocking our cells. Cristina seemed cautious, but stepped out. Vas looked to me, and I just shrugged. The brigadier general stood and followed us silently, bringing up the rear, as we proceeded through the jail's hallways. If they were going to fake a breakout and then kill us there was nothing we could do about it.

But the guards didn't seem concerned. Few even bothered looking at us.

Ethan led us to a waiting room, where he picked up several sets of rather nice formal clothes and threw one to each of us. "Get out of those prison jumpsuits. On live television, image matters more than anything else."

I approached him, confused. "Why are you doing all this?"

"Are you a terrorist?" he asked.

"No"

"Then it's just the *right thing to do*, now isn't it?" He took a pull from his shrinking cigar, regarding it with worried eyes. "Time's growing short, and I think you people, from what I've heard, have a very slight chance of actually turning things around. And anyway, if we're all about to die, what does anything matter, save some last minute heroics? Maybe sneak my way into a good afterlife"

I didn't know what to say, except: "Thanks."

He nodded, and I moved to an unoccupied corner to change, taking care to avoid disturbing my fresh bandages or the crude black cast on my broken leg. They'd taken the old bandages regularly, and we'd all had a good laugh the first night as the bitey things under my wraps had startled our visiting physician.

Reaching for my shirt, I glanced across the room.

Cristina's back was directly to me, so she didn't see me looking at the brutal gunshot scar near her right shoulder blade, and at the countless angry and poorly-healed lacerations that marred her skin. It looked like someone had thrown her into a blender and left her to die.

Which someone had, really. I glared angrily at Vasiliev, who glanced at me, then at her mutilated back. He immediately shot his gaze to the floor and dressed in a shameful hurry.

Once dressed, Ethan led us to another room, where a team of grim-faced lawyers began telling us how to sit, how to speak, and how to react. 

I couldn't focus.

Was that how she'd survived? The gunshot wound had not been in an instantly fatal location had she passed out during the beating and stabbings? Or had she purposely remained quiet, despite all the pain, so that they would think she'd died?

"Just remember," the lead lawyer told us, looking each of us in the eye and snapping me out of my thoughts. "Rich people escape consequences. The more educated and classy you portray yourself, the better chance you'll have, even though the masses know you're not wealthy. The government is using you as scapegoats to focus public ire, so the only way you're getting out of this alive is by winning public opinion over to your side. Make them see you as heroes of the working class - not wealthy, but smart and classy like someone who is - and they'll clamor for your release."

His words fell on the four of us rather bluntly. Did he realize that we were all soldiers? We'd never intersected with the world of fanciness, class, or dinner parties. At the only social events I'd ever attended, I'd been working security.

We were ushered out after the briefing, and then escorted through a vast series of hallways. By that point, I'd lost all track of our legal strategy, the ongoing explanations from the lawyers, and where we were going. All I could do was limp along and try to keep up. Too many questions were rolling around in my head.

Leaving the hallways behind, we rather abruptly entered a vast cathedral-like space outside the courtroom proper. Multiple news crews immediately fixated on us. As they shoved their cameras near us, shouted questions, and took pictures, I looked only to Cristina.

She had her jaw set rather hard, as if she was expecting something very dark ahead.

It was strange to move through that wide space, knowing that we were on live global television, but not really seeing or feeling the billions watching. There were just the pushy camera crews and a general crowd of Important People going about Important Business.

Heavy wooden doors opened, and we were led in. The courtroom itself was a very stately affair, lined in cherry woods and gold, and I would have thought it part of some mansion or highly official State building if I hadn't walked in from jail directly through dingy old hallways.

I'd expected something more impactful, but nope. That was it. No fanfare, and no specific moment when it all officially began. I just sat down at one of the front tables, along with my alleged partners in crime and our team of lawyers.

Ethan and Not-exactly Noah sat in the crowd of seated onlookers behind us.

A white-haired older man in long black robes entered and took the central stand. He regarded a thick pad of notes for a few minutes, glancing at us intermittently.

The prosecution lawyers entered, took up seats at their table, and began reviewing notes as well.

Sixteen very normal-looking folk queued in and took seats in the long cherry wood jury box to our right. They waited quietly, sometimes coughing or sniffing.

Still sitting with no instruction or idea what was happening, the three of us exchanged awkward glances. Even Cristina's grim foreboding had temporarily faded in favor of confused boredom.

The brigadier general sat motionless at the far end of our line of four, staring forward with military focus. He was a good head or two taller than the lawyers seated beyond him, and somehow managed to dominate the room even while sitting, and still.

The uncomfortable waiting ended with an explosion - the bursting open of the main doors as a sharply dressed and visibly haughty blonde man entered the room ahead of a wave of news crews and cameras. I vaguely recognized him.

"That's the AG himself," one of our lawyers whispered. "Daniels."

I'd heard his name a few times in the last five years. In person, he seemed more like a celebrity than a head lawyer. The cameras were mainly focused on him, as he confidently spoke to whoever was listening which was probably pretty much everyone.

He had the book under one arm.

It suddenly occurred to me that a device like that might make a lawyer's career go from esteemed to legendary. It was no wonder he seemed so obnoxiously assured of his own victory here.

He turned away from the cameras and approached, ignoring us to head straight to the judge and have a short conversation. The judge nodded a few times, frowned, and then shrugged.

Daniels swung around and finally looked at us, sizing each of us up in turn. I returned his gaze with calm and curious neutrality. I knew that I was innocent of whatever the hell was being pinned on us, and that the book under his arm would say as much. What exactly was his plan for us?

Did he have something else on us?

"Let me start by saying this would normally be illegal, and we recognize that," he stated to the cameras, lifting the book. "But the Emergency Authorization Act has temporarily repealed a defendant's right against self-incrimination. This is a time of crisis, and drastic measures must be undertaken. Much has been said in the media lately regarding this book, and I want to confirm for you what over a hundred scientists and physicists and technicians have confirmed and sworn before the eyes of the law: it's true. This book forces the truth out of people."

He took a deep sigh, his earlier haughtiness carefully masked behind a feigned heavy heart. "And I would still personally advise against its use - after all, what ramifications would this have on our legal system? If we could force the truth out of anyone, what use is a jury? What use is a trial? These are questions beyond the scope of this proceeding." He stepped close to us, and the cameras followed. "Furthermore, the brigadier general - Ward Shaw, the man known as the Sword - has been the primary focus of our witnesses and testimonies up until this point. I want to remind everyone, however, that the person or persons truly on trial here are the men responsible for the current crisis - the terrorist organization that this man has helmed for the last five years."

The Sword kept his subtly indignant stare, and gave no reaction.

"Or so we thought," Daniels continued, reaching a crescendo. "The truth, we suspect, is far worse. The Black-eyed Army is responsible for some of the worst atrocities mankind has ever seen -"

He continued talking, but I lost track of his words for a moment. The Black-eyed Army? That would be the men who had attacked the refugee headquarters, hurt and killed all those children, and dragged off many of the brownshirts brainwashed and tortured Not-exactly Noah and, judging by the way Daniels said it, they'd also committed numerous other acts against the First World. I'd actually heard them mentioned during my years as a bodyguard, but, since I didn't watch television, I'd just kind of assumed people had been talking about characters from a popular show or something

I turned and looked at the Sword. I'd seen his black eyes and impossible strength firsthand.

And he'd said, while so possessed, that he was going to take down the Shield.

I kept my expression calm, but I couldn't help but shiver. It was true. The brigadier general *was* guilty, and he *had* led a terrorist organization.

And I was sitting here next to him

"But today is special," Daniels said, stepping closer to our table. "Which is why we've chosen to extend our broadcasts. Not only are people watching throughout the world, we're sending our live stream out into the doomed lands, too, so that those less fortunate than us may take hope that justice is finally being served."

A low roar reached us, barely audible through the walls. It hadn't occurred to me that, while we *were* being broadcast globally, a large crowd might have shown up in person. We could hear them outside the justice building, responding with enthusiasm to the Attorney General's words.

Vasiliev and I exchanged worried glances. Daniels seemed serious - we had no way of knowing if it was true that we were going to be televised beyond the inner Shield, but there didn't seem to be a reason for him to lie.

One look at Cristina told me the truth. Nobody else would have noticed the change in her, but I could sense her contained sorrow. Everyone would see what was going to happen here. Thomas, Danny, and all of the other people we'd met would all be watching. Her manner suddenly made sense to me, too whatever she had planned, she held the hidden internal tension of a soon-to-be martyr.

Suddenly, I was paying attention to every single word. If Cristina was going to hit trouble, I intended to be there for her.

"And justice will be served more directly than any of us realized," Daniels continued. "Lady Justice has smiled upon us. We have the *leader* of the Black-eyed Army here with us today, in our custody. On this day, we will finally know the evil depths to which these enemies of mankind have sunk."

I looked to the Sword as he took a deep and expectant breath.

Daniels moved near the judge and faced us. "I call to the stand: Cristina Thompson."

My head swung the other way, but my brain did not understand. I watched as my ex-wife grimly stood, approached the stand, and sat down. Several ritual oaths and words were exchanged, and, at the question "Do you swear to tell the truth?," Cristina narrowed her eyes and replied, "I won't have a choice."

The startled older woman who had done the oaths froze, looked to Daniels, and then hurried off.

"No need for questions, I suppose," he announced to the camera, barely able to hide his triumphant smirk. "I suppose I'll just read from this book aloud." He looked up briefly. "We've positioned a camera overhead to confirm and record."

A technician with a large headset gave a thumbs-up from behind one of the camera crews.

"Okay then." He turned to Cristina and opened the book. "Through many testimonies by a slew of your old comrades, we're familiar with most of what happened out in the desert five years ago, just before the Crushing Fist began. Everyone now knows the backstory. But now it's time for the story of your turn to terrorism itself." He looked down at the pages. "Tell me about the Black-eyed Army's creation."

I looked on with wide eyes. If it was true, would she - no. No terrible black-eyed reaction welled up in her, and the book did not shock Daniels, however much I would have liked to see that happen.

He began reading aloud.

---

I knew I'd lost the fight the moment a tiny spear of fire shot through my chest. The blast wave hurt in every corner of my body, and I fell to the sand.

All personal thoughts had shut off, and I sat atop a gray hill, watching the flow of actions I would need to take to survive the next few minutes if it was possible at all. Was this how my story was going to end? After so much bitter fighting

The first kick nearly made me cry out, but I made no noise. I was surrounded by brutalized men and women who'd been tortured to their limits, and I'd taken down a few myself. They weren't going to be kind.

A slice of lightning dug into my lower back, and I pressed my face against the sand, feigning death.

They didn't stop.

A hail of kicks and soul-rending sharp pains rained down on me, and I stopped being able to hear their angry shouting over the blinding pressure in my awareness.

They moved on just as I thought I was surely dead but that still left me in the sand, dying.

I'd tried to keep track of the stabbings. Fifteen? Twenty? I'd lost count. I was on my stomach, and lucky for that. The stab wounds were all above my heart, more or less, and sand-free. I had to keep them that way.

Through growing dizziness, I began crawling forward. 

*Mutineers are coming for you,* I thought. *Take care of them.*

"The rebels are also attacking us from the west," the Sword's voice echoed in my thoughts. "What are your orders?"

Trembling and trying to pull myself along uneven sand, I didn't have time or capacity for mercy. *Just end it. Kill all of them.*

"Understood."

*And send medical personnel. I've been stabbed.*

Gunfire echoed in the open night air.

"I can't. They're all dead."

I was still partially lucid, and I thought, for a moment, that I might actually manage to what? Where was I going? My arms began feeling heavy.

I wasn't far from the medical tent.

It was then I noticed that crawling forward was getting easier. The sand beneath and behind me was wet, and I started sliding over it a little easier.

Oh.

Overcome by a dizzy spell, I let my head fall to the sand just outside the medical tent. Part of me kept expecting Conn to swoop in and save me like he always had before, but that wasn't a thing anymore. Why am I crying? Stop crying! Get up!

Through blurry eyes, I dragged my way a little further, and reached up to grab at specific supplies. Half of my brain was despairing over a life I didn't have anymore, and the other half was screaming tactics to preserve the sliver of existence that I still clutched close.

Open the container. Get the refrigerated blood. Check the types. That type. Get out the rest. Connect the cannula to the secuvam was that right? Stop shaking. Focus!

I missed my vein on the first try, and winced at the sharp pain that broke through the numbness all along my body. I almost didn't have the strength to attempt it again but, for a moment, I imagined a strong hand lifting my wrist Conn, helping me one last time

On the second try, it went in, and a strange feeling moved through me as my blood pressure changed.

With the immediate drain countered, rage began seeping back into me. The Preacher was still out there, and I wasn't going to die in the sand like some pathetic worm until I'd seen every single half-alive corpse in its mass torn apart and burned.

Laura deserved that much.

Mirror get the mirror

I positioned my crooked arm, holding the mirror so that I could see my shredded clothing.

With my other arm, I pulled at it, screaming weakly with the effort until it tore away.

It was all red. Everything was red. Red everywhere

Fighting dizziness, I knocked more supplies from above. Rooting through them, I picked a needle and thread out of the sand. If God was out there, only that bastard knew how long this was going to take. There were so many sliced holes *in me* in the body I'd always called me now a mangled doll barely held together

Reaching back with a shaking hand, I slowly went about the work of stitching up my stab wounds one at a time. At the difficult angle and viewpoint, each stitch was a hard-fought victory. I tried to start with the exposed rib bones I could see near my shoulder blades, but they were too hard to reach. I was forced to start lower.

I began to feel dizzy again, and noticed the blood bag was almost empty. Stopping to hook up another - the only one left with my blood type - I was interrupted by an equally surprised young man.

"Are you alright?" he asked, startled. "Do you need hel-"

I dropped the mirror, pulled the gun that had fallen to my left side with my torn clothes, and shot him with my off hand.

Pierced through the forehead, he fell.

His clothes had not been military - he'd been a rebel. I knew their story, and the extent of their unfair and dire situation, but I didn't have time or opportunity for compassion.

Ears ringing from the shot, nearly blacked out by a sudden surge of dizziness, I quickly hooked up the second blood bag and went back to stitching myself up.

"The rebels are making headway," the Sword's voice echoed in my mind again. "They've got defectors among them as well. I don't think we can win this."

I pressed my thumb against the meat of my left forearm, amplifying the effect of the purple bio-stone embedded within. *Then gather up everyone still loyal. We'll escape through the Sphere.*

"Is that safe?" he asked.

I pressed the bio-stone harder, and I could almost feel his sudden surge of pain. *We're about to find out.* Wincing, I tried to think of what else needed taking. *Get all the gear you can, and send men to get the anomalous weapons, biotics, and tools. And send someone to get me at Medical Tent Four at the first opportunity. I'm not sure I can walk.*

"We can't get to you. The rebels are all around your position."

*Then go without me. You know what to do. Find out if the stakes are as high as we suspected.*

"Yes, sir."

It wouldn't do to be seen near the dead young man. Mostly sewn up, I used the last of my strength to crawl out into the chilly night sand. Desert-clothed men streamed around the tents, and I feebly raised a hand, trying to catch their attention. If they didn't shoot me on sight, then maybe

I didn't reach full consciousness for an unspecified time. When I did, I was in a rebel camp. They'd patched me up and kept me alive even performed surgery for my perforated intestines.

Their doctor said that I'd been extremely lucky.

They clearly had no idea who I was. I didn't disabuse them of any notions they might have about my identity, and instead played the wounded and unhappy soldier.

Apparently, a great many defectors had escaped into their care.

---

Locked in a storm of confusing emotions, I just listened and stared at my ex-wife, who I now realized had been hurt *far* more than I'd ever known by what had happened to our family. I could see, in that five-years-gone version of her, a bitter rage beyond control. And did *did the Preacher have our daughter's body?*

Cristina didn't seem to be able to look at me. Thomas, Danny, and everyone else had heard that story. She'd spoken of *things* she'd done in the past how would they feel now that they knew who she really was?

Daniels stopped. "I don't understand. How did this create the Black-eyed Army?"

The brigadier general spoke for the first time that day, stating his response from our table - and out of turn. "What do you think, fool? That a mysterious black Sphere out in the desert would simply allow us to travel to other realities without consequences?"

The judge slammed down his gavel. "Please keep silent while testimony is being given."

The larger man set his jaw and said nothing further.

Daniels gave each of us another strong glance, sizing us up once more. He was clearly hearing things outside of the narrative he'd expected. He turned back to Cristina. "Why does the brigadier general take orders from you? And how did you communicate telepathically?"

She tensed up, her eyes narrow with fear and honesty. It seemed harder for her to say it out loud than it had been for her to listen to the words taken from her very soul. "I was not just figuring out ways to kill or neutralize unknown threats. I was also keeping track of them, cataloguing them using them."

"The purple bio-stone," Daniels replied.

She nodded.

"What's it do?"

"I told him I could use it to make him stronger smarter." She looked over at the Sword. "I lied. Instead, it gave me absolute control over him."

Even through my emotional paralysis, I suddenly understood: when I'd tried to use the book, *something else had already had a hold on the brigadier general's soul.* The book hadn't turned him into a monster - it'd temporarily freed the monster he had already been!

Beside me, Vasiliev was red-faced, and barely keeping his confused anger under control. He'd realized that the bio-stone's control meant Ward Shaw - the Sword - hadn't *actually* ordered any of those terrible tortures upon him.

Cristina had.

Had she also ordered the attack that had resulted in so many dead children? The Sword had been here, in jail

"Someone high up in the chain of command, giving you power over an entire brigade" Daniels breathed, piecing it together himself. "So you've been commanding the Black-eyed Army through him all of this time?"

"Just read the book," she shot back, turning away her glare.

Daniels looked down again. "It seems it's skipped ahead..."

---

"You're awake," a deep male voice said in my mind. "And therefore alive"

It was him but different.

*What's your status?* I thought aloud.

His voice seemed odd. "I led the remaining battalions into the Sphere."

*And what happened?*

"Our escape was not without cost." His thoughts remained calm as always, despite his words hinting at emotions he should have been feeling. "I don't have the words to describe the pain and horror we endured in our crossing. The Sphere was not empty. If I was capable of hating you, I probably would."

But the bio-stone in his spine wouldn't allow it. I sat up in my small tent, where the rebels had let me recover. *What did you find out there?*

"The Shield is cracked, as we thought, and the black Sphere generating the Ink came from outside. After taking several trips through living nightmare, we have set up camp on a dead world. Our equipment has better readings of the damage from out here. It seems something enormous beyond compare struck the outer Shield about six months ago."

We'd suspected as much *Enormous beyond compare?*

I felt him sigh with resignation. "The outer Shield temporarily lost ninety-six percent of its integrity, and several of the inner realities have shifted in place relative to one another. In addition, there are a great number of realities that once neighbored our region that are gone."

*Gone?* I sat up higher, and paid for it with body-wide pain.

"Gone," he thought again. "Destroyed. Inaccessible, removed, nonexistent. There's a gap out here three hundred and eighty-six realities wide. Erenia, Torvald, and Yngtak are all gone. We are right inside of the edge of the vast gulf left behind. It looks like we were struck only a glancing blow - and it still nearly destroyed us."

*What the hell? What could do that?*

"When I was younger," he replied. "I once had contact with an entity seeking a safe place to heal and grow. The First World, being so heavily shielded, was a natural location for such."

*How did it get in?*

"It was linked to me from the past. It came to the First World, using me as a beacon, long before we ever erected the Shields."

*And you think that entity did this?*

"No. That entity sailed on the seas of the multiverse, as big as several realities itself when fully grown. Its entire race was wiped out by a single blind and mad creature that flailed about in the dark."

I'd heard something about his now-quite-old report - the incident that had sparked him joining the military. He'd had no proof of the larger entities described, so it hadn't been widely publicized but they had certainly used the complex neural bioresources found at the site to vastly advance the state of modern medicine - the fields of limb and organ regeneration in particular. *So you think this gigantic creature has been attacking us?*

"No," he replied, quite grim. "I saw it firsthand, through other eyes. I think a single random flailing of a single one of its limbs caused all of this destruction."

*What?* I thought, rather horrified. *Just how goddamn big* **is** *it?*

"As big as you can imagine and then a thousand times bigger than that."

Despite the pain, I clambered up. I had to radio someone tell someone and I had more questions. *Why isn't the Shield healing?*

"Unknown. We'll need more time to figure that out. There are some residual forces built up on the outside... and they're growing for some reason. What should we do?"

*This is way beyond the engineers back home. We need to find the entities that helped us build it.*

"Shall we come retrieve you? We can use the Sphere to go almost anywhere, now that shadows and pain inhabit every cell in our bodies."

I cringed. *No I'm going to do some searching on my own. I think I'll avoid becoming filled with shadows, thank you.*

"So be it," he replied calmly.

---

Daniels stopped again, confused. "You didn't cause the Crushing Fist"

"Of course not," Cristina said bitterly. "You think *we* brought on a crisis of this magnitude? By messing with some black Sphere in the desert?"

"No matter," the AG shot back. "You're not on trial for that. You're on trial for what the Black-eyed Army has done in the meantime causing continual damage to the Shield, attacking First World military bases and stealing exotic weapons and biotics, and bringing about the current crisis out there."

"Out there?" she asked, laughing in angry disbelief. "Have you been outside? *This world is in trouble.*"

"We're perfectly safe behind the golden Shield," Daniels said with a smirk, mugging for the cameras. "Everyone knows that."

She stood, ignoring the judge's banging gavel. "Have you felt the heat? The searing winds?" she shouted. "The First World isn't safe."

He raised both arms. "Now, now. Scientists are conflicted on whether or not the world is warming, let alone whether it's the fault of the Crushing Fist. We've been assured nothing can get to us. The inner Shield was never damaged like the outer one."

"I've had some time to think it through," she shouted louder, standing high on the witness stand's wooden edge and grabbing the attention of the camera crews. "And I know exactly what's about to happen here."

[Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/39vdsy/repost_i_was_told_that_everyone_id_served_with_in/)

If you guys ever read these emails, you'll of course be aware I didn't die there in the flames and ashes but it was the roughest trial of my life.

A hazy blur scattered and arced across my awareness for quite some time. I thought that I'd died, but brief flashes of coherency made me confused and hopeful. Was there existence after death? Was I on my way there? I felt heat at times, and chill at others. Sometimes, I was at peace, and sometimes, I was fighting hard through a horrific pain. Was I careening between Heaven and Hell, waiting to tip into one or the other based on the life experiences bubbling up and draining repeatedly through my thoughts?

Through it all, I felt her there. She was always there, even though I'd abandoned her all those years ago.

Consciousness came back in a single abrupt strike to my forehead. I blinked, imagining electricity still arcing through my brain from the thud of waking.

The first thing I noticed was the heat and, then, the fact that I was sitting chest-high in a pool of blood.

Part of me was sure I'd ended up on the wrong side of the afterlife divide, but I wasn't afraid. If that was true, it just meant one more fight, and one more journey. I would claw and bite my way through the forces of Hell if I had to, and then start walking, intent on finding wherever Cristina had gone. I'd found something in that stand against the Sword, and I was never going to abandon her again. I promised existence itself that much.

I tried to get up from the thick crimson liquid, but my limbs were weak. Shakily forcing my way up, I stood and felt a heavy draining sensation in my lower back and thighs.

"Wait!" a voice I thought I'd never hear again said sharply. "Don't get up. We took a severe amount of shrapnel out of you, and you're basically Swiss cheese down there."

I fell roughly back into the pool of blood.

The ground around was comprised of mostly flat volcanic rock, and a heavy tent arched above, keeping us protected from the elements. I could see that it had been constructed from parachutes meaning I was still in Teskoy's prison reality.

"What is this stuff?" I asked feebly, trying to locate the speaker - I needed to see her face.

Behind me, I heard her stand. "It's a cohesive non-sentient scavenger. It scoots across the ground, hides in crevices, and comes out to drain the blood of sleeping or dead creatures, in order to add to its mass."

I held my arms out of the crimson fluid, stunned. "Why am I in it?"

"Your circulatory system is part of it at the moment. It's pumping through you in and out of your open wounds."

I shuddered. "Is it compatible?"

"The bloodtype?" she asked. "Hell if I know. But we figured it had to normalize its internal systems *somehow.* Probably strips antigens and pathogens. And you're alive, so there's some empirical evidence."

Suddenly remembering my injuries, I prompted motion in my broken leg - and found it bound extremely tightly by something unseen under the red.

Was I actually going to *live?* I'd written myself off but there was another question, more burning.

"Cristina?"

She came slowly around the pool and sat cross-legged next to the red. Those light brown eyes watched me with compassion and a thousand other deeply hidden emotions. She'd always been one to hide what was going on inside, and the years hadn't changed that.

But my heart leapt in my chest, pumping that strange liquid creature's blood through me. "Vasiliev Blaku said he killed you"

She lowered her eyes for a moment, and I thought I sensed a deep pain and loneliness in her face. The mask came back a split second later, and she looked to the side. "Well, I survived."

Standing, she picked up some random equipment from a stack nearby, and began fiddling with it. To anyone else, she would have seemed intent and busy, but I could tell there was really a storm going on inside her. "I'm sorry."

"You're sorry?" she asked, not looking at me. "For what?"

"For leaving. It was a mistake, and I've regretted it ever since."

"Well I survived that, too," she said roughly, immediately moving toward the tent's exit. Just short of it, she stopped, bent down, and kissed me on the forehead.

Then she was gone, and I was left alone to peer after her, my pulse racing and my emotions in turmoil. How had she survived? What wasn't she telling me? And where was I, exactly? Was there some *safe tent* in the *vile thousand-year pit of scum and evil?*

And wait, there was so much I had to tell her! I'd been sent to rescue a woman of exactly her description. I hadn't thought anything of it at the time, because it couldn't possibly have been her, but it *was* and it made sense, too, because she had always gone headlong into the heart of danger, intent on doing what was needed, because that was who she was.

Or, who she *had been*, at least, before our daughter had died.

After that, I had no idea what had happened to her. If she hadn't died in the sand five years ago, where had she been all this time? What had she been doing? She would never have been able to find or contact me while I was in the First World but I had no way to know if she would have even wanted to talk to me.

Left alone with my thoughts, I had nothing to do but churn.

Through it all, I kept one thing clear in my head: I was not going to abandon her this time. Nothing else mattered - not the person she might have become, not anything she might have done. She was in Teskoy, so something had clearly gone awry in her life, but -

Wait. The chip hadn't I seen her activating it?

I had too many questions, and no one to ask. All I could do was wait.

Several hours later, a white-haired woman entered, wearing long brown rags and a tight cloth over her mouth and nose. "Get up, and lie flat on your stomach," she said calmly, indicating a bundle in her hands.

Carefully and slowly, I clambered out onto rock, feeling much like a fish leaving the ocean for the first time.

Quickly and expertly, the old woman stabbed me repeatedly with a little needle, tying threads from the bundle into my flesh directly. She seemed to work for a very long time - just how many pieces of shrapnel had punctured me? The painful stitches stung all over the back of my lower body.

At long last, she made a noise of achievement, placed several large squishy patches on my skin, and then had me lift up a few inches so that she could wrap thick brown bandages tightly around my midsection.

"You're not gonna die," she cooed. "From this, anyway. Make sure to take those jelly-biters off before nightfall."

It occurred to me that the large squishy patches might not actually be bandages. I could feel waves of little prodding feelers I shuddered again, imagining some sort of flat amoeba-like creature giving me a thousand tiny little bites.

"They'll eat the bacteria, and whatever shards of metal you still have in you," she said, standing and heading for the exit. "Also, your ribs are bruised, and we had to re-inflate one of your lungs. Take it easy, son. *Really.*"

"Wait," I asked. "What's going on?"

"Going on?" she responded, eyes curious.

"Should I talk to somebody? Where are we, exactly?"

She laughed lightly. "We're in prison, dear. There's nobody to talk to, and there's nothing to do but exist."

She slid out, and I was alone again.

I was absolutely not going to sit around for a second stretch of hours. Forcing myself up on one shaky foot and one solid leg encased in a heavy black cast, I limped to the tent flaps.

Oh, yeah I knew immediately that I really shouldn't have done that. The sky was pure black, a void that cut the eye, but it was not empty. Creatures floated among drifting ash clouds weird huge bird-things, a few balloon-like bags of gas with myriad drifting tentacles, and what looked like a ruby cube, just floating there in the sky, a mile or two across on each side.

As I looked at the distant vast red gemstone cube, it rotated and I felt watched in return. Somehow, as distant and aloof as it was, it seemed to have sensed my observation.

Hurriedly looking away, I hoped I hadn't attracted dangerous attention. What were the rules in a place like this? None at all, I imagined.

And below - for we were very high up along a tremendous volcanic mountainside - valleys stretched away to the lava-lit horizon. The colors and shapes within were terrifying and chaotic. Spectral forms moved among blue crystal mounds unique to a valley to my left, a great writhing beast rolled along the line of the horizon itself, and motion in the shadows between it and our mountain belied an endless number of unseen threats.

"Any one of those things could murder us all," Cristina commented, her arms folded as she sat on a metal crate right outside the tent. She hadn't gone far "But they don't care about us at all. We're nothing but ants in the distance, and that's the only reason we survive. Seems to be the way of things in this life, doesn't it?"

I limped over and sat down on the long-cooled lava rock next to her crate. I didn't have the strength to sit up on my own, and I didn't care if I received a negative reaction it was the highlight of my life, and of the last decade, to see her alive again - even if it *was* in existence's closest approximation of Hell itself.

I leaned my head against her leg.

She hesitated, still fearful of being touched after all these years but she reached down and ran a hand through my hair, eventually settling it on my shoulder.

She never had any words. That wasn't her way.

I watched the distant valley for a time, just happy to sit there with her, before turning my eyes to the camp all around me.

Several tents had been made out of parachutes, and strung up in safe places among the rocks. Looking a bit up the mountainside, I could see two immense lava flows splitting above, creating a deadly moat around the makeshift haven these people had built.

And the people did not seem to be the legendary scum and brutes I'd been told about.

There was the old woman who had stitched me up. Past her, a tent with a Yngtak arc painted on it in black - the yellow-skins that lived within would never harm another without orders from their Prelate, and there were no Prelates to be found here. And beyond that tent lay an assortment of people sitting, crafting, and keeping a look out. None bore the trademark shiftiness and suspicion of a criminal.

These were just normal people, living in a tiny safe bubble in the worst environment imaginable. In a way, it seemed analogous to our Shield, and the way we'd tried to cut ourselves off from the multiverse.

That was the tragedy of life: nothing lasts forever.

"I tried your chip," she said suddenly, her eyes on the distant horizon as she continually and silently judged the path of the gigantic creature rolling by. "A blue portal opened about an inch wide, but then shut again. I think the explosion of the facility up top pushed us deeper into the inner Shield. Whoever sent you, they can't help us now." She looked over and down at me. "That blue portal who made it?"

"A boy named Thomas," I responded. "He's an awkward young man, but he's absolutely endearing somehow. And he's not human, so there's that."

She nodded slowly for ten seconds straight, and then breathed a deep sigh of relief. "So he's alright? Is he in good hands?"

"You know him?" I asked. "Yeah, he's got a ton of kids with him, and one of them - Danny - is kind of running the show."

She actually gave a genuine laugh at that. "Makes sense."

I looked up. "How do you know them all?"

"They're my kids"

"Wait, what?" I shot back, alarmed. "When did you - how - with *who?*"

"No, no!" she laughed again, her inner chaos momentarily dispelled. "Terrible things happened in their hometown, and I was trying to take care of them before all this." She paused significantly. "I care about them. And I have to get back to them."

Relieved, I gave my best feeble laugh through the pain in my chest. "Welp, they want to find you pretty badly. Sent us all on a rescue mission just for you, at least at first. Thomas' people were a secondary win."

"Wait, you found them?" she asked, suddenly sharp. "Where?"

"Yeah, got them all out. They were up there in the facility."

That brought all her masks back down, and her eyes went distant as she began rapidly turning mental gears.

I stared up at her. "What is it?"

I could tell, by her face, that she wasn't used to divulging information, and might have not told me but she decided otherwise. "We need them. En masse, they helped grow the Branches and build the Shield about a thousand years ago, back when the First World was just a budding power, and dead set on making alliances to survive."

That meant "Can they help us stop the Crushing Fist? Can they revitalize the Shield?"

She stood abruptly. The single word fell flat and direct on my ears. "*Yes.*"

A large man approached from across the camp.

"One way or another," she said softly. "We're approaching the end of all this. I just hope -"

She cut herself off as our privacy was disrupted.

The brigadier general stopped in front of us, his hard eyes on me. "It's done."

I regarded him with apprehension. He didn't seem to be the black-eyed monstrosity I'd fruitlessly fought high above, but he was still the man that had brutally tortured and shot his own men to achieve his goals.

"Okay," she replied, before looking at me. "Conn you're going to need to bring that book with us."

"The book? You didn't pick it up where I passed out?"

She pointed.

I looked down at my hand which was firmly gripping the book. "What in the hell? Have I had this the whole time?"

"It's a curious device, isn't it? You can't get rid of it, even if you try. All you can do is give it to someone else. How did you guys solve the portal damage problem?"

"Huh? What portal damage problem?"

She paused, thinking, before asking a different question. "Does Thomas close the portal after each time he travels?"

I nodded.

"That must be it. Gives space a chance to heal or something." She shook off the concern.

Had that been a problem at some point? I had no way of knowing.

I frowned, too, after realizing the intent of something else she'd said. "I have to bring it with us? Where are we going?"

The brigadier general, hearing my question, held out my chip and pressed something that protruded from it.

Almost immediately, a cyclone of violet and white roared to life around us. Pulled forward, I stumbled onto hard metal, clutching for dear life as the spinning platform slowed.

A half-dozen firearms erupted above me, backed by purposeful shouts.

As the uniformed soldiers took us into custody, I looked over in confused askance, and Cristina mouthed a silent apology to me. They pushed the Sword ahead, and her after, and I was escorted carefully behind in begrudging acknowledgement of my extensive injuries.

Out of one prison, into another - this one far more traditional.

They threw me in, and the gate clanged shut with an echoing note of finality.

The brigadier general was in a cell next to mine, and Cristina had been placed opposite me. "Come on," I whispered. "He can kick his way out of here. I've seen it."

She shook her head.

"What about these bitey things on my back?" I asked, pained and confused. "The old woman said they could eat metal. What if I -"

She shook her head again. "Conn. We need to be here."

"What?" I stared. "You turned yourselves in!"

"Yes."

"*Why?* Everyone is waiting for you just outside the inner Shield -"

She took a deep breath and looked at the floor. "We're here, Conn, because I have done things things that I'm not proud of and my soul can't take it anymore. I came here for help with the Crushing Fist, but then I realized what was going on. I can't let these people die."

"Who?"

She tipped her head up briefly. "Take a look out your window."

Climbing up on the bunk in my cell, I put my face to the bars.

A hot wind whistled past, and the day was bright I recalled my walk, with Noah and Larry, through the military compound on the way to Teskoy. An unknown number of days later, the oppressive heat and bitterly dry winds had grown worse. "It's not just an unseasonable heat wave"

"No," she confirmed quietly.

"What's going to happen?"

"It won't be pretty," she responded, her light brown eyes grim.

My heart full of unidentifiable emotions, I watched those eyes as she spoke. There had been a time when they'd been full of laughter, warmth, and love but I supposed I had once been a reliable and steadfast man, too. Life had broken us.

 "I don't have enough information to say for sure how it'll happen," she continued. "But there's an absolutely tremendous amount of force bearing down on the outer Shield. It translates down through the Branches, usually being distributed out until it's no longer a problem but the force just keeps rising."

"That's what Danny said," I told her. "We're literally being crushed."

"Yeah." She bit her lip briefly as she thought. "There are gigantic machines somewhere on the First World, and on several Branch worlds, that have kept the system running for a very long time bigger, more powerful, and more complex than anything you and I know. But they're still just machines, and there *will* be a breaking point." She looked up at the window above my head again. "That heat"

"They're working overtime," I realized.

"Exactly." She moved to her bunk and sat down. "The machines are designed well - they won't explode or anything like that. They'll just fail first, and the incalculable forces growing on the Shield will erupt through like a brutal spear. The inner Shield is just acting as a focal point for all the pressure, making it worse."

The true depth of what she was saying hit me, then: "The First World isn't safe"

"No. They'll all die in a rather horrible and unique manner, as far as I can guess."

I understood. "Is that why we're here?"

"Yes." She glanced over at the brigadier general. "For the Trial of the Decade. He's going on the witness stand for the first time this week. They've had a parade of soldiers, politicians, and patsies building a narrative against him, but he *will* be given a chance to speak himself. And when he does"

The man in question finally interjected. "The whole world will be watching, live."

"They can't silence you, or hide the truth!"

I saw his hand curl around one of the bars of his cell. "Exactly. The First World will know that we must stand together, shake off the insipid apathy that has so plagued the human race, and fight as one - or we will all die. The poor will die outside our golden walls, but we will die inside them. There is no difference, save spite."

I had to give him one thing: he was an eloquent monster. He *had* said, just before our fight, that he was simply doing what must be done. I'd had no idea he'd meant working toward something important like this. Could I actually work with this brutal thug?

As if on cue, a fourth prisoner was abruptly brought in.

"Vas!" I called, watching him get thrown in the cell opposite the Sword.

He was covered in soot, and his orange jumpsuit from Teskoy was slashed and burned, but he was alive. "Whaddya know?" he laughed bitterly. "Broke out of one prison just to jump into another." He stared across the way. "And in full view of a man I've sworn to kill."

The Sword said nothing.

Cristina looked at me.

I stood close to my bars. "Vas we can't. We need him. He's going on trial - on global live television - and he's going to tell everyone what's really going on. It might just be the turnaround we need."

The younger man listened, processed, and then began pacing angrily in his cell, but he made no further instigations.

That was it, then, for conversation. All we could do was wait and listen to the imperceptibly rising howl of the hot winds outside.

More than anything, those furious winds felt like a sadistic clock, each new surge ticking away the seconds we had left until the end.

[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/39vdlf/repost_i_was_told_that_everyone_id_served_with_in/)

Heart thumping, every breath palpable, and my senses sharpened by adrenaline, time seemed to slow as I walked with my former comrade in arms. He and I were both, now, soldiers once more even if it would only be for a brief time.

That was what being a soldier was really about: years of training, both physical and mental, for a few scant moments of violence that usually occurred with little or no warning. You had to internalize the readiness for violence; you had to make it part of you. If you didn't, you'd hesitate when the moment thrust itself upon you, and you would die.

Empty cells drifted by on either side, and the floor vibrated with the weak echoes of an earthquake that must have been on the First World proper. The facility had been built thousands of feet up, in the wall of this shard reality itself, so there was no opportunity for normal earthquakes here only those that translated weakly through the golden inner Shield.

I raised my radio as we walked. We'd planned on keeping radio silence, but, judging by the apathy and absence we'd seen, there was no threat. "Noah, how's it coming over there?" I imagined that he'd made the same assessment about using the radios. He responded after a moment.

"We found the brownshirts. No sign of the woman. You?"

I didn't know who she was, or why we'd been sent to save her, but I sensed that finding Thomas' people was a huge victory in itself. I also didn't want any interruptions for what Vasiliev and I were about to do. It was a secret objective from the young man in command, but it was also something we were obligated to do as soldiers, as men, and as whatever parts of the human condition we had played as husbands, fathers, or brothers. "I assume that our ace in the hole can reach us with their help, and the compass chip?"

Another moment passed. "Yes, it seems so, now that they're out of their cells and can work together. They've opened an active portal with help from the other side."

"Alright then," I told him. "Get everyone out of here. We'll come to your wing when we're done searching all the cells."

His radio came on, but he said nothing for a beat. It was then that I knew, instinctively, that he had sensed the grim resignation to violence in my voice. "I'll wait as long as I can," he finally said, implying concern and good luck.

I turned my radio off and stashed it back on my belt.

Vasiliev led the way down another turn. The hallway before us stood unused, more bars framing empty cells.

I kept my eyes forward as we walked, but there were certain things that needed to be said in the moments before a potential battle. If it turned out that the brigadier general was the guilty man we thought that he was he would not go without a fight. That much I knew of his reputation. "You don't have any kids, do you, Blaku?"

He shook his head. "Nah." His stray hand stroked his beard. "Well, maybe. I kinda joined up to run from a pregnancy scare. Her father literally had a shotgun, and was going to force me to marry her."

My pre-battle tension abated somewhat in the face of that strange revelation. "Really?"

He grinned. "No."

"Goddamnit." It was good, at least, to see that some small part of his former spirit remained.

That small resurgence faded as reality returned to his worried features. "Nah, though. No kids. And I'm glad, given the world they'd be enduring right now. You?"

For a moment, I felt that I could see through the walls ahead, and see straight into the foggy gloom of all existence. If I died here today, my life would hang like a frayed line through all the paths that had been walked or avoided by all the people that had ever lived. I would always exist, just like other people in my life would always still exist, even if they weren't around anymore. "No. Not for a long time."

"Ah. Well. Whatever we do here today, it's for everyone else's kids, then. Still a good cause." He led the way around the last corner, and his demeanor changed from apologetic to grim.

An absolute mountain of a man sat in the last cell, his gaze already on us. A sharp brown beard complimented a heavy brow and dark eyes that immediately put me on guard. Out of respect, they'd allowed him to keep his uniform, rather than giving him an orange jumpsuit like my companion.

I'd never met him in person, but I knew: this was the man they called the Double-Edged Sword. This was the man that had tortured and shot his own men to drive them into Hell itself for reasons unknown.

Shoulder to shoulder, Vasiliev and I stepped down the grey stone-and-metal hallway in full military posture. It was automatic in us, still, despite the passage of so many years.

The brigadier general slowly stood, his thick legs creaking as his muscles adjusted. He approached the bars, stopping as we did. His dark gaze never wavered from my face, and his deep voice mirrored his implicit authority. "How are you here?"

I slid out the book. "Never mind that. It's time to find out the truth."

He looked down at what I was doing, and, to my surprise, *he* looked surprised. "Don't open that -!"

But, of course, I wasn't going to stop on his say-so. I flipped open the pages - and found myself looking at a confusing jumble of random words. The text on the page blinked, flickered strangely, and then disappeared. In its place, on the center of the page, sat only two words:

---

**CRITICAL FAILURE**

---

Confused, I looked up.

The brigadier general clung to the bars, his head forward, his face low, as if he was in pain. His deep voice dropped an octave, becoming almost drum-like and guttural. "You can't go to the places I've gone without coming back changed." He took a long breath, and his fingers curled tight around the bars. "I have seen the end, and the beginning. I have seen the Truth of the universe, and it is enough to drive a rational mind mad. In the true span of existence, humankind is nothing at all. The walls we put up in a futile attempt to keep out the inevitable - denial, violence, greed - will be our own unmaking."

"Did you go into the Sphere?" Vasiliev asked, his eyes going wide.

I flipped a page in the book, but the same strange flickering happened.

---

**CRITICAL FAILURE**

**DISCHARGE HAZARD**

---

"The Sphere?" the huge man asked, slowly raising his head to look us in the eyes. "From the deserts of Earth Forty-four, *five years ago?*" He laughed mockingly. "You're so far behind, you don't even know which questions to ask."

"Then tell us," Vasiliev roared, furious. "Explain yourself. *Justify what you did!*"

I flipped to the next page - and my fingers seized as spectral blue energies arced and zapped from the book, forcing me to drop it. Residual pain echoed through my arms as I watched it fall to the floor, where it lay open, text flickering and pages still arcing blue.

The Sword stood tall, seeming to grow an inch with righteous zeal. "There is nothing I would apologize for. What must be done, must be done."

"But you hurt people - you killed people - !"

"A man is nothing but a pile of flesh," he growled, curling his knuckles to white around the bars. "Would you weep for an ant, sacrificed for the survival of the hive? But enough talk. I'm going to end this foolish dream once and for all. I'm going to bring down the Shield. It is the only course of action left."

As I fought to recover from the book's energetic shock, Vasiliev stepped closer to the bars. "No, sir. I aimed to stop you five years ago, but I failed. This time, I won't."

The huge bearded man adjusted his uniform slightly, and then cracked his neck. "We each choose our own path to Hell."

I think it occurred to both Blaku and I at the same time: when the Sword had said he'd come back *changed*, he might have meant that literally. We watched as he braced himself, pulled mightily and tore a bar right from his cell gate.

We both reacted on pure trained instinct, diving to either side as the huge man's fury-fueled kick tore his gate right from its hinges and bolts.

Vasiliev pushed away from the gate he'd fallen against - just in time to avoid the impact of a heavily swung bar, which clanged loudly and bent at the end from the sheer force.

I held my breath momentarily to avoid coughing from the cloud of concrete dust the break-out had released, and my hands automatically reached for a loose bar on the floor. I brought it up just as Vas fell roughly back to avoid a shoulder-height swing; I thought I'd gotten the drop, but the Sword rotated with lightning speed and brought his bent weapon up to block.

Even during my split-second recovery, he reset his stance and sliced his bent bar at me at waist height. I got lucky by reacting without even being able to see the attack or think about it; I just knew that I had to do *something*, and that something involved using both hands to shove my own rod to my left.

His attack hit metal. I felt my bar bend, and a tremendous force went up my tensed arms, flinging me painfully onto a bed of fiery ribbons as my back hit the floor with no resistance.

My thoughts were all gone, but soldier reflexes remained. My eyes had fallen upon Vas, and his upon me, and I threw him my bent bar without hesitation. In sync, he deftly caught it, and nearly managed to catch the hulking brute from behind while his attention was on me.

As bars clanged again, I scrambled to my feet, ignoring a desperate pain in my shoulders - they'd been shocked by the book, and then burned by what felt like a truck impact, and they were protesting forcefully. I couldn't afford to listen; not then. Taking a precious few seconds to dislodge another bar from the shattered gate, I managed to hit the brigadier general in the lower back just before his strike blew concrete chunks from the wall near Vasiliev's head.

He roared in pain, and Vas answered with a shout of his own - and a bent metal rod to the face.

The Sword dropped his weapon and stumbled back down the hall a step or two, briefly disoriented.

Vas and I moved forward together, eyes afire.

I hit the bearded man along the side of his face, splitting his ear; my companion gave his leg a brutal strike.

The combined pains brought forth a bellow of rage, and he pushed up, absorbing two more hits as he crashed between us - and then down the hall.

We stood there for just a moment, watching him, and absorbing the fact that we'd somehow managed to survive the surprise onslaught on cue, we both rushed after him, another earthquake trembling the floor as we ran.

Using the few spare moments to strategize, I raised my radio. "Noah, the Sword is loose, and he's dangerous as hell."

"Is that what that was?" he asked, concerned. "What do you want me to do?"

"Get out of here and close it up. We can't risk him escaping."

Vas glanced over at me as we ran. "You've got a way out?!"

"Not anymore," I responded between panting breaths. "Sorry."

The radio crackled to life once more. He didn't ask if I was sure. He hadn't hesitated. "You're the last ones left there. It's closing now. You'll have to find another - Jesus!"

We rounded a corner to find the hulking brigadier general halfway down a hallway of open cells, his arm shoulder-deep in a roiling spacial disturbance.

Noah's voice returned. "He's trying to get through! Is that even possible?"

There was no time to waste. We both knew what we had to do.

Shaking rather violently with the force of the portal trying to reject his entry, the Sword set his jaw with rage, brought up his other hand, and started *pulling at the spectral blue edges, trying to force them apart.*

Part of me noted that we had no clue what we were dealing with - no idea what we'd walked into with our foolish wish for vengeance - even as our bent bars impacted his head and back.

He'd *actually managed to begin pulling the portal back open!* But our assault forced him to let go and jump back with all his strength. Falling against cold grey stone, he took a breath, anticipated our swings, and leapt down and to the side.

Breathing raggedly and holding a hand up to stem the tide of blood streaming from his head, he ran again.

Steeling myself against pain and adrenaline-exhaustion, I followed Blaku as he dashed after his former commander.

The three of us rounded the front hallway just as a confused guard sighted us. He'd been sleeping in the front area, but our fight had surely woken him. Instead of fumbling for his gun as I'd expected, he reached for something on the wall, just out of sight.

It must have been a button, because a heavy door slammed down in front of the brigadier general, bringing him up short. The door held a large rectangular glass window laced with crossed wires, and he began beating upon it, even cracking it in short order - but the guard on the other side hit a few more buttons with terrified eyes.

The room beyond suddenly turned violet and white and pulled away into infinite distance, disconnected from our shard reality completely.

We'd just been cut off.

The Sword slowly turned, his dark eyes practically black with hate. He began to speak

but the floor rocked with a very different kind of vibration.

Explosions!

They'd been dumping convicts, the unwanted, and creatures of every sort in Teskoy for centuries. *Of course* they'd have had a last-ditch failsafe!

We three realized simultaneously what had happened as monstrous shaking hinted at the fracturing of the supports that held the facility in the dimensional wall.

The floor bounced, screamed louder than any structure had a right to, and then tilted at a severe angle.

We froze, all of us, as the screeching came to a slow, grinding halt when the hallway's dangerous tilt reached near thirty degrees.

For a long moment, nobody dared move.

It made sense that the failsafe bombs had probably been poorly maintained, given the state of the rest of the military. A couple years without checks some of them might have gone bad. Even the brigadier general clutched the wall, too tense to move, as we each silently ran the possibilities.

Another distant and massive crack - and a two degree further drop - ended our momentary truce.

This time, we ran not at the Sword, but away from him. The helijet area had been on the way to the cells, and Vasiliev must have seen it while being brought in he and I'd had the thought at the same time.

For as large as he was, the brigadier general was terrifyingly fast, and it was all we could do to outpace him at oddly slanted corners and doors, even throwing our bars to slow him down. We burst into the helijet bay and slammed the door shut behind us.

Most of the machines had slid right out along the steep angle. The last one was teetering on the edge of the broken hangar doors even as we scanned the wide bay. "Go!" I shouted, and Blaku ran for it while I held the door shut.

I only managed a few seconds' delay. The huge man beyond ripped the door from my hands, and then pushed his way inside as I backed up. Standing higher up on the slope than me, he looked even bigger than before or was he *really* bigger?

And it wasn't just my imagination *his eyes had gone fully black.*

"There's something *in you,*" I panted, raising both fists despite burning shoulders.

"**I know,**" he breathed, his voice deeper than any I'd ever heard from a man.

I backed carefully down the sloped steel-plated floor, trying to buy time for Vasiliev to get the helijet going. "What did you do? Did you make a deal with the Devil?"

"In a manner of speaking," he responded, his anger and subtle mockery from earlier gone. In its place remained only a kind of despairing resignation. "But, as such deals go, she pulled one over on me." He lifted his meaty fists, his black eyes cold. "There's nowhere to go, you know. Teskoy is a concentrated pit of the worst evils, threats, and scum this civilization has accumulated over the last thousand years. Even if you somehow beat me, you might get down there and wish you'd just let me kill you."

Shaking sweat out of my eyes, I grinned. Despite it all, I'd missed the action - or, rather, its importance. I'd done nothing but run since the moment my life had fallen apart. I'd run from the military, run from Cristina, and run from life. The military had faded to a shadow, Cristina had died bleeding and alone in the sand, and I'd hid in the fringes of the First World.

Five years and I hadn't done a single important thing in all that time. I'd been too busy putting up with rich brats and telling myself it was necessary for survival. Was that some part of what the Sword had been saying? Greed, violence, denial what *was* the point of staying alive if it meant a life shrouded in all the wrong principles?

Right. *This* mattered.

My grin widened. "So you think I can beat you?" I asked, picking at his taunt.

His expression remained flat. "No."

"Oh."

His charge came at a blinding speed, but I felt at one with myself for the first time in half a decade. I'd been a soldier most of my life - I had the skills. I had the reflexes. I could move faster than thought; react faster than fists. One hit from that beast would surely kill me, but his own strength would be my best weapon.

Rapid drift under a swing at my face, quick jab to the stomach, dive forward and to the left under his arms turn around, left hook to his cheek as he turns to face me, rotate away as his fist comes up from below, pull his arm and push forward

He stumbled and fell to his hands, driven along with his own force, and I brought an elbow down on the back of his neck, ending the sequence I'd instinctively known would happen before he'd even made a move.

He shot up out of anger - and I kicked him straight in the face, anticipating his placement and vector.

He rolled away, his nose leaking blood. He gave an intense inhuman roar as he clambered to his feet, and I thought I saw veins around the edges of his temples go black.

Of course, he hadn't noticed the emergency firearm next to the helijet door. I'd seen it while holding the door shut. It was locked by fingerprint access but I was a special agent now, according to the computers. Hoping they'd had time to update or sync or whatever, I pressed my thumb against it, desperately watched the Sword recovering and running for me, and -

I fired first at his thigh, then at his chest, and then grazed his head as he fell. Now to just -

Oops.

That sound that shaking must have been the rest of the explosives finally going off.

Thanks to my training, I'd also noted emergency parachutes on the wall - the ones they gave to unfortunate convicts before shoving them out of this very bay - and I grabbed one during my blazing run down the plate-metal hangar floor. If Vasiliev had managed to start the helijet before it had fallen out of the hangar, he'd find his own way down. I didn't see the craft anywhere nearby, and I didn't want him trying to get near - not with what was about to happen up here.

Forty degrees, forty-five, fifty and then I was half-falling, half-leaping out into ash clouds and heat. 

I'd done paratrooper training more than once, but this was immediately insane. All I had was an estimate of two thousand feet, and I knew that jumpers usually pulled their parachutes at twice that height and lightning crackled all around as I drifted through volcanic ash. Was it -

I calmed down and lost my train of thought as my lower back and thighs went sharply numb. Somewhere behind me, the facility had continued exploding and shearing off, and a tremendous amount of shrapnel and debris had surely been thrown free. I'd sensed that this might be the last fight in my life, and now I understood. I pulled the cord on my parachute with no willpower of my own, simply because I'd been moving to do it anyway.

Drifting for a time, I tried to tie my fatigues tighter to stop the blood loss, but I just couldn't concentrate

until I rather brutally crashed into hard black soil, lit only by nearby glowing lava flows. I couldn't feel my leg, but I could feel it snap, and I clutched at the ground from being swept away - my parachute was still caught by volcanic winds, and it was dragging me toward some sort of smoking mud flat. It wasn't molten, but, even as I watched, my parachute made contact and began melting.

*Acid?* If it could eat through a parachute so quickly, was it dangerous to organic flesh? I couldn't risk it. Fighting to hold on to the rock and soil scraping by underneath my fingers, I tried to resist the pull, and only managed to unhook my connection to the parachute at the last moment.

I lay back, relieved, as the ropes slid off into the acid mud proper and began smoking until something flicked up and grabbed my arm.

An inch-thick tentacle had extended from a pit about ten feet away, perhaps finding me by my vibrations.

Suddenly, it wrapped tight, and a horrifying strength pulled me forward. In moments, I felt the soil give way, and I began sliding down into the moist pit. I saw the firearm I'd found high above slide out of my clothing and down, but I was too slow to catch it before it dipped into some unseen maw.

I had no weapons, and couldn't brace against my broken leg - instead, furious as hell, I clenched my arm and pulled close, giving that godforsaken tentacle a straight bite.

Whatever was in the pit screeched, and the screech became a roar as I bit down again. Green ichor splattered across my face, stinking worse than the sulfur in the air.

It let go.

I pulled myself up and out of that disgusting pit with what strength I had left, repeatedly telling myself that *I wasn't gonna die here, not like this not in this pit* I crawled away, intent on getting out of its range. I didn't want that *thing* feasting on my body.

Before too long, I was forced to stop short and keep my head low.

Eerie, pale, and translucent forms floated past a few dozen feet ahead. They were huge, spindly, and instantly recognizable as trees.

I'd heard someone mention tree ghosts as a possible threat. I just hadn't imagined that had meant the actual ghosts of trees. What? How did that even? And were they *what?*

Before I had time to process more on that topic, the first massive impacts shook the earth nearby as giant chunks of the facility reached the surface.

Flames, too, sailed across the skies above, landing with napalm aplomb. There was nothing I could do but hug the ground and pray that Mother Earth might see fit to protect my frail life as the Sword had put it, my broken pile of flesh, now hurt, bleeding, and burning on primordial ground.

And there was nowhere to go, in any case. The connection back had been severed. I was in Teskoy to stay forever.

Unless the chip Ethan had given me couldn't be the same as the one Noah had used to signal Thomas, could it? They'd gotten it from Alek, who had come from outside the Shield and he'd gotten it from where? I couldn't think

I just couldn't focus

It *had* mattered. I'd done something that mattered. I'd stayed, and I'd ensured the destruction of a monster beyond mortal judgment. I hadn't run away, like last time. Tears were streaming down my face, but for what reason, I couldn't call to mind. I began crawling forward again, trying to reach something ahead someone ahead. "I'm sorry, Laura," I whispered forward, sobbing for no reason I could grasp, wishing that there was anything I could have done differently all those years ago. Would it have done right by her memory to stay? Should I have stayed? If I had stayed, Cristina her mother might still have been alive. Or would I have just died in the Ink like all those other soldiers?

To Hell with it. I should have stayed. I knew that now. 

There was some great emotional sentiment that I wanted to make with my last draining heartbeats, if she could hear me, but the words wouldn't come. Instead, I just balled up a fist and struck the black soil in frustration.

I heard an answering thump as a separate stimulus from the crashing, thudding, and exploding all around. I knew immediately what it was: another parachuted man reaching the ground.

Looking over, I saw, by lava light, the brigadier general unclipping his parachute and standing.

I would have laughed if one of my lungs hadn't been collapsed. All I could do was croak. "You have got to be fucking kidding me"

The air currents had taken him straight to the same place they'd taken me with one major exception.

He was on the other side of the acidic mud.

No trace of my parachute remained. I didn't actually have the strength or the ability to stand, but I reached into my soul directly for power beyond all probability, and I managed to climb to my feet. For a moment, I imagined Laura beside me, helping me stand and who could say that wasn't possible, in such a place? One last family act. "Come on!" I shouted. "Let's end this."

"You really have a death wish," he replied. "If you hadn't spoken, I wouldn't have seen you, all covered in soot like that. I'd have assumed you died, especially with tree ghosts around"

I glared. "Really? Tree ghosts?"

He tilted his head. "Have you seen what they can do to a man? They don't have morality like we do. They don't understand what pain is - but they're certainly curious about it." He stepped forward, pausing, unaware, at the edge of the acid mud. "I don't have to kill you. You could simply help me do what needs to be done. You are military, after all, and I outrank you."

"I quit five years ago," I replied, trying not to show how wounded I was, even as the back of my clothes soaked warm with blood.

"Curious. Just before it all began" His shadow-filled eyes remained solid black amid dancing molten light. "What's your name, soldier?"

"Thompson," I told him, even as he looked down and noticed the edge of his boot smoking.

My acid mud ploy had failed, and I was done, besides. Coughing warm crimson and falling to the ground, I groaned. Even as I hit the black soil, it plopped right to the ground in front me, still open and arcing blue - the book, falling where the winds had taken it.

"Thompson?" he shouted, aghast. "Wait -!"

I reached out, employing a terrible guess, and shut the book closed.

He stopped stood taller and then began walking around the acid mud.

I wanted to swear, but I couldn't find the breath to speak.

He stood above me, looking down with normal eyes. They were still cold, but they were human. "Oh, no," he said softly, belying his dark gaze. "I'm sorry."

As I lay there bleeding and broken, I became aware of someone running up along the soil.

Drifting in and out of consciousness, I tried to stay focused. Whoever they were, they had a thick cloth over their face, so that only their eyes showed through beautiful eyes, but hard, perhaps even more so than the brigadier general's. In that grimness, I thought, for maybe a second, that there was compassion and concern, too.

"They wouldn't have sent him without some way to signal back." She began quickly searching through my charred clothing. A few moments later, she put her face directly above mine. "I'm gonna need you to stay awake," she said softly. "You're safe now. Where is it?"

I trusted her. The Sword stood behind and above her, calm and waiting the way he had been before I'd opened that accursed book. What had it *done* to him?

Reaching into my hidden pocket, I pulled out the chip Ethan had given me.

I couldn't see her mouth, but I could tell, by her eyes, that she was smiling. She clicked something on the chip, and then began rotating newly jutting little pieces. "You're gonna be alright. I promise."

"No, I won't," I responded, crying and smiling unhappily. "I know I'm already dead."

"Why's that?" she asked. Laura stood above and behind her, calm and waiting.

And we were all together again, at the end. I couldn't help but smile weakly. The stories they'd been right all along. Who knew?

"Because you're here and you're dead, too," I choked out, just before everything went dark.

The officer to his left lifted his firearm and -

The shot rang out, startling our entire crowd of exhausted soldiers.

The brigadier general spoke again. "Go back into the Ink and disarm those explosives. You have *no idea* what's at stake here."

"Because you haven't told us!" a woman to my right yelled. "You have us out here on some revenge quest -"

"Hughes, shoot that woman."

Another shot rang out, and she fell to the sand, bleeding.

"I will not hesitate," the Sword continued, his eyes fierce. "Go disarm the explosives."

None of us wanted to speak up after that. Slowly, our resolve failed, and - followed closely by officers with guns - we headed back into the Ink, found the Sphere, and disarmed the fireworks.

Many were sobbing uncontrollably as we did so, and many more were trying not to look at the nightmarish worlds within that ungodly Sphere.

He didn't even have us set up an ambush - he wanted the Preacher to come out, thinking it was safe to stalk us once more. It would never come back if we had the Sphere surrounded

I lay in my tent that night running plans in my head. There was no way to walk to safety - the desert was filled with rebels that would shoot us on sight. And why wouldn't they? We'd taken their way of life, and all of their economic resources. It was what we had always done out here, more or less, at least until this nightmare had begun.

There was nowhere to go, and there was no escape.

I remember staring up at the empty bunks in my tent, realizing it nearly aloud.

The Sword had to die.

I felt like a ghost. I floated up from my bunk, and I drifted between the tents, whispering the words that would most certainly get *somebody* killed. Us, if we were found out - him, if we were not.

Perhaps *I* was insane by that point. I'd been hit by a giant mirrored tentacle, subjected to weeks of mental torture, thrown in a hotbox as physical torture, and cornered like an animal in every way possible. By then, I didn't even care if I survived.

The Sword had to die.

She was going around asking details about the Sphere when she heard what I was planning. I liked her, I did, and she seemed like a fine person, but we would all die if the Sword found out. She was already on her way to tell him, I was sure.

I came at her from behind with a knife, trying to stay quiet, but she somehow heard my approach, and swung out of the way of the first strike. She was a hell of a fighter, and I was caught off guard. She knocked the knife from my hand, and I barely managed to leap toward it in the sand and prevent her from getting it. We struggled there, until one of my fellow mutineers came at her and knocked her away.

She shot right back up, got the knife, and slashed his arm deeply. He fell back, biting his lip to keep from screaming and giving us away.

A woman - one of ours - leapt in from around the edge of a tent, but Thompson straight up stabbed her in the shoulder despite my grip on her other arm.

Two more men came to assist, even as Thompson came around and viciously bit me in the neck. She took out a chunk, barely missing a vital artery or my throat, and I was forced to let her go. While I was gripping my neck, she ducked under one man's kick, responded with a punch between his legs, and came back up to stab the other man in the chest.

The knife got stuck, and she spent one second too long trying to get it out.

I shot her in the back.

The shot rang out, and shouts responded from nearby, even as my furious comrades surrounded her, kicking and stabbing her repeatedly out of animalistic revenge. She didn't make a sound, and I was glad: it meant she'd died from the initial shot, and hadn't felt the brutal beating that followed. She wasn't a bad person, she'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time.

There was no more time to delay, really. I pulled them off of her, and we ran as a group for the brigadier general's tent but it was too late.

They gunned most of the others down, and I fled.

I ran off into the desert, still bleeding from my neck, weak from everything else that had happened and rebels found me. For some reason, they let me live, and they even helped me get better. I -

---

I looked up from the book.

Vasiliev Blaku stood at the other end of his cell, watching me back. A large scar on his neck still indicated the place Cristina had bit him.

The place she'd bit him just before he'd shot her. Just before they'd beaten her lifeless body to a pulp.

But she'd certainly taken to heart the personal defense training I'd given her. Was there some other sequence of events in which she might have survived? Just a second's difference

But I wasn't angry. The cold fury that had burned all through me to get me to this point was simply gone. I'd come here to kill this man but now I just felt drained.

Cristina's story was over.

I'd found out all the last details of her life, all the mysteries, and that was it. Vasiliev had been a wounded animal, and he'd been cornered by the brigadier general. He'd suffered in a way no man should have had to suffer.

Who was to blame? Who could be brought to justice for any of this, except the Sword himself?

Blaku could see the emotions in my eyes change rapidly. He trembled and sighed with relief as he saw my murderous intent fade. "You're not gonna kill me, are you?"

I shook my head. "No. I think that would cost me more than I'm willing to give." I sighed with relief myself. "But I do think we're honor-bound to be soldiers one last time together."

He knew my meaning already. "The Sword is one of these hallways, one of these cells."

"Yes." I stepped back, letting him out. "Yes, he is." I hefted the book. "And this this finds out the truth. Will you come with me and find out the truth of all this? And, if he is indeed the terrible man you knew if he brought the Crushing Fist upon us"

"Yes. I'm going to finish what I started back then, in the desert." He stepped forward. "No trial for that monster. I'm gonna kill him myself."

I walked with him, feeling much like the ghost he'd described himself as before doing something terrible. The First World had given up, the outer Shield was failing, nobody gave a shit about anything anymore, a half-trillion people were going to start starving in two months, and everyone was going to die.

It seemed the only thing left to do was tie up loose ends - mete out justice for those who deserved a fate worse than simply dying with the rest of humanity at whatever random moment the Shield failed. The book would get the truth, and we would finally know

The man trembled, but spoke for us. "Sir, I've been locked up at gunpoint, given endless scans, sent into supernatural darkness, seen my squadmates torn apart and then delivered back to me, put up with endless evil sermons, even shot a friend because a mosquito got in his brain. I'm *tired* and I know if I go back in the Ink, I'm gonna die."

The brigadier general nodded, his gaze scanning the tired faces around him. "You all feel this way?"

Nods followed.

He stepped back, and his already deep voice lowered an octave with grim anger. "If we don't deal with this situation, we are all going to die. That means that you will probably die whether you go back into the Ink or not."

Unhappy murmurs circled the crowd.

As he walked away, his order cut right into our hopes. "Have them build hotboxes, and put them all through in a rotation until they comply. Two hours each."

A great unhappy noise swelled among us, but we were soldiers, and we weren't going back into the Ink for the moment so we followed the officers' orders, and began building our own torture devices under the hot Sun.

I was already sweaty and tired when they threw me in the one I'd built.

It was simple, really - six metal plates bolted together. It hadn't even taken very long to make.

But my two hours would feel like forever.

I sat in there, sweating, frying, melting for an eternity. All I wanted was to go home. This was a nightmare in every sense. Down one path, there was darkness and hellish threats that continually tore at us, at our sanity down the other, slowly dying in a hotbox.

The Sword wasn't going to let us leave.

It occurred to me, in a flash of feverish inspiration, that nobody had taken brain scans of the brigadier general himself. How did we know *he* wasn't under some evil influence?

What if a neural mosquito had gotten to *him*, and this was its way of slowly killing all of us?

I cried, but no tears came out. I was too dehydrated.

I remember being very certain that I was going to die in that box before I ever got a chance to grab for that one slim hope

But the top did eventually open, and they pulled me out and dumped the next guy in.

I stumbled to the nearest water and guzzled it down alongside a long line of other red-skinned soldiers doing the same.

As soon as I could, I slipped away, and found Thompson. She was in the techie tent, drawing plans to kill the Preacher. Her face was absolutely filled with hate for that thing and I couldn't blame her but she quickly threw on a neutral expression when she saw me.

It was all I could do just to talk through my heat exhaustion. "I have a theory that the brigadier general's been compromised."

She regarded me with a skeptical but open look. "Oh?"

I nodded, and tried to breathe normally. "This is crazy it's unlike any campaign I've ever been on. That man is driving us forward with torture, and he doesn't care if we die. Do you have any recent brain scans of him? Like you took on us?"

Her gaze went distant for a moment. "No I don't, actually."

"Will you get one?" I asked, desperate.

She nodded. "You're thinking neural mosquito?"

"Yeah."

"I'll manage it," she promised quietly. "Now get out of here before someone sees you. Nobody can know about this conversation."

I made it to my bunk and fell before my body completely gave out and they came for me a few minutes later, dragging me back to the hotbox for my next turn.

There were a great many people in those boxes, in the sand, in the heat crying.

We couldn't last. It simply wasn't possible.

Groans and shouts gave way, and we were all spared the hotboxes for agreeing to go back into the Ink the next day.

I lay in my empty tent, awake the entire night, hoping against hope that your ex-wife would come through before we had to go back into that dark and silent Hell.

She snuck in some time just before dawn, a brain scan document in hand.

"What'd you get?" I asked, exuberant, even trying to sit up.

She shook her head and showed me. "He's clean."

"*What?*"

"Nothing wrong with his brain. No mosquitoes. Whatever's out in the Ink, it really must be worth all this suffering."

I remember sobbing uncontrollably. "No."

"I'm sorry," she said, pouring some water across my reddened forehead. "But we're all here for a reason. Everything he's done is technically legal." She paused. "But if he gets worse, come to me. I'll make some calls."

I could only screw up my face and nod.

And, then, a few hours later, it was time to gear up and go back out.

There was no chatter, no murmurs no talk of any kind. Silent, broken, despairing, we went through the motions of setting up lights and guarding ourselves against unknown threats, but I was sure each of us simply expected to die in some new and horrible way.

It was on that day that we finally reached our objective.

I think we were six miles deep into the Ink at that point, and four miles straight down thanks to the impossible slope. I envisioned it as an immense unseen crater that existed only inside that valley of darkness

And it was just sitting there at the center of the enormous crater, the slope stretching up and away on all sides.

"Any contact with the Preacher yet?" the brigadier general asked over the static-filled radio relays.

Nobody responded in the affirmative. They wouldn't, because I knew where the Preacher had gone. It had continually retreated whenever we'd tried to attack it and it had vacuumed up more than one of our dead colleagues to add to its bulk. Standing with five other men and staring at the source of the Ink, I knew where it had gone each night.

The ten-foot-high sphere sat casually in the sand, like it had simply chosen to fall and rest there. Each edge held an asymptotic darkness, but, within, we saw another place.

As we watched, it shifted.

Another place and another seconds later, another

This was some sort of hellish egg, or black hole, or shadow portal, or *something* and it went to places beyond any of our worst fears.

We reported our discovery, and the next order did not surprise us at all.

"All units, gather at the Sphere. We'll deploy each time the blood-lakes and corpse-mountains world appears."

This time, I knew who spoke. It was me. I picked up my radio, and signed what felt like my own death warrant: "No, sir."

"Do it."

Another man raised his radio, his gaze aghast as he witnessed what looked like, in all actuality, Hell itself. His words were as tear-filled as his eyes. "No, sir. We refuse."

"*The Preacher must die!*" the Sword roared over the radio, his high shout causing a burst of static.

Forty men and women now stood outside the Sphere, lit by a weird shadow-light that ignored the ten foot limit, and we looked at each other in confusion. The Preacher? Was that the true objective of our operations? Judging from the anger and hate in that shout, was this some sort of revenge mission? Or had he simply lost it completely?

"Set your charges," I remember breathing, and, somehow, everyone heard me. I wasn't in charge, but they listened.

We piled up all the C4 and other explosives we had. We took all our mortar shells and rigged them up. We surrounded that fucking thing with enough firepower to blow a hole in reality itself. Fitting, judging by what I guessed that it was.

We trekked back through the Ink, unafraid now. Everything that had been in here had been coldly and carefully murdered by thousands of armed men and women, and there was nothing left but us. We'd never figured out who had been leaving our friends' limbs for us to find, but we guessed that, since they hadn't attacked us yet, they never would.

Long lines of soldiers trekked out of the Ink together, and we headed back to camp, soul-weary.

The Sword was standing there, waiting for us, all of the officers lined up to his left and right. His monolithic stance and grim expression indicated immediately that we were in trouble.

Somebody explained what we'd done, and that we'd set a timer on the explosives.

He took a breath, and somehow grew even taller. "Go back into the Ink and disarm those explosives."

"There's hardly time," someone said.

"Reed," the Sword ordered, not so much as moving his head. "Shoot that man in the leg."

[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/39vdj6/repost_i_was_told_that_everyone_id_served_with_in/)

After the day I've had, I almost feel like I'm in the military again that sense of accomplishment, of a mission well done. This is what I used to live for.

*Fifty-seven fifty-eight fifty-nine* sixty.

I slowed my pace as I hit the thirtieth minute of my morning run around the nearby drainage pool. The slightly sloped hill around the mile-wide shallows was the only place I'd found clear of camping refugees. Their numbers had only grown with each passing hour, and the farming plains often looked like an ocean of people.

The young man that I'd met the afternoon before, who I now knew as Danny, approached from behind. A good eighty men, women, and children of various ages followed him, forming organized ranks.

"And what do you do if you see a shadowy humanoid with bright eyes, one violet, and one blue?" Danny called loudly, face held forward, his eyes on the clear slopes ahead.

"Don't listen to their calls," the group repeated in unison. "They mimic voices."

He shouted something else, but they'd begun moving past. I slowed to a stop and watched them make their way around the vast drainage pool. How had such a young man come to be some sort of leader figure? And where had he learned pseudo-military training tactics?

As I stood there, recovering my breath, I saw a younger boy sitting by the water. He was thin, wore glasses, and sat with his arms around his knees. I'd seen him at the tech building, so I knew he was part of the core crowd of kids and teenagers that had somehow become part of our command structure, but he hadn't spoken much.

"Not training with the others?" I asked, sitting cross-legged a few feet to his left.

He looked at me, pushed up his glasses, and then glanced at the runners. "Sometimes I do. I haven't really gotten the hang of this body yet."

I couldn't help but smile. "Yeah, it's a strange age to be. Things changing constantly I was a huge klutz for a couple years when I hit puberty."

He looked back at me in surprise. "You? But you're so cool!"

"Nah," I laughed, oddly embarrassed. "The military beats you into shape, that's all." I held out a hand. "I'm Conn."

"Thomas" he replied, shaking my hand with growing conviction as he realized that I was truly showing him respect.

I made sure to turn my gaze out onto the water, where the Sun rippled in ethereal blue. "I can't tell you how good it is to see *blue* skies again. We're all along way from home out here, aren't we?"

Thomas nodded.

I could tell he wasn't in a talkative mood. Alright then I picked up a small rock, and then threw it just right. It bounced eight times before sinking in the water.

"Whoah, how'd you do that?" he asked, sitting up a little higher.

"My father taught me." I handed him a stone. "Here's a good one. You gotta look for flat ones, and then hold them just so."

He tried the underhanded throw I'd demonstrated, and his rock actually skipped two or three times. "That is *so weird!* It must be the surface tension bouncing the rock away"

I shook my head. "You'd think so, but the rock is actually flying the same way a wing does. It doesn't fly in the air, but it does fly in the denser water enough that it pops right back out again. That's why you spin the rock. The spinning keeps it stabilized."

"No way."

"Try it."

He laughed as his second throw - with more spin applied - went a far greater distance than the first. "That's crazy!"

"The world's full of weirdness," I told him, practically mirroring what my father had once said to me. It'd been a long time since I'd spoken to a child like that, and it dredged up cloudy pains alongside the happy recollections.

The small radios at our belts crackled to life, calling us to headquarters. We walked to the tech building wordlessly, although Thomas took a rock with him, and looked at it in wonder several times as we wended our way through the ocean of tents.

Within, a great many people stood crowded around a central table. All of the desks, monitors, and equipment had been pushed aside to make room for the watchers. Among them stood many of the people who had been running - and Danny stepped forward and leaned over the edge of the table, wiping some sweat from his forehead.

"This is a tough one," he said, still cooling down from his run. "We talked most of the night trying to figure out how to attack this, based on these specs Heath retrieved, and on what Thompson told us." He glanced at me, then looked around at his peers. "Turns out Teskoy is some sort of shard reality that never got off the ground. There's an Earth there, but no stars, and no Sun."

"What heats it?" someone asked quietly - a lanky man who somehow managed to seem distant from the crowded onlookers while standing directly among them. His eyes were narrowed.

Danny turned to me again. "Thompson, this is Noah. He's going with you as part of the plan."

I said nothing, but nodded at the first new member of my team. I had potential words, but I would reserve them for when the person in charge was done speaking - and if he asked.

"The Earth there is heated by the same internal pressures we have here, and, because the reality shard is so small, the specs say it's also heated by dimensional friction. It's literally somewhere inside the First World's Shield, caught between layers. It's also described as tremendously horrible the stuff of nightmares, because they've had quite a long time to fill it with all the people and creatures they didn't know what else to do with. There's no light, and no order. They throw you in there and forget about you."

"An oubliette," someone offered, and many nodded.

I knew that the Sword was there while on trial I wondered how they might retrieve him for that when needed, but Danny had anticipated that concern.

"High-profile prisoners, or those still on trial, are kept in part of the access facility up here," he said, pointing. "It's embedded in the wall of the reality maybe two thousand feet up. Basically hanging there in the starless sky" He shook his head. "We're hoping that's where she is. She said something to Heath about trying to get the First Worlders to help, so there might be some conversation with the higher-ups going on there that would warrant her staying in the facility itself."

"And if she's not?" my distant and taciturn new partner asked. Noah, I told myself, trying to remember yet another name in the dozens I'd learned in the past twenty-four hours.

"Then things get ugly," Danny answered, a drop of sweat rolling down his forehead. He looked over at a clean-shaven and grim-faced twenty-something in a ratty rock-and-roll shirt. "The chip that Alek gave us doesn't just act as a compass and access key to the First World. It also has a slight inherent signature that our ace in the hole can sense. We'll try to open a portal directly to you. Heath thinks the prison might still be accessible since it's not fully within the inner Shield. It floats near the surface of the gold at times, and that'll be our chance." He nodded nearly straight forward. "Jay and his men will come through that portal as backup, ready to fight if need be."

"How are Thompson and Fulmer getting to the prison itself?" the indicated man asked.

Fulmer? I repeated the name in my head. Noah Fulmer.

"They're going to take our Yngtak ally as a pretend prisoner," Danny explained, smiling lightly. "The oldest trick in the book. Thompson, do you think that will work?"

Suddenly the center of attention, I stood slightly taller. "Yes. The Yngtaks and the First World have a violent and hate-filled history. They won't even question it."

"In case they do, I've managed to alter your personnel records on a poorly protected sub-server," a warm male voice chimed in over a computer speaker. "Congratulations on your promotion. You're now a special agent who was purposely sent out to capture an enemy spy."

I tilted my head inquisitively.

"That's Heath," Danny said, a hidden conflict beneath his mask of confidence. "He's helping us from a remote location."

I nodded, wondering at the odd looks on the faces in our command circle. I didn't ask about it.

"So," Danny continued. "You bring the prisoner back through a portal hub facility we found, and then try to escort him to Teskoy. Noah will go with you, dressed in as fine a suit as we can manage. From what you told us, as long as he acts high and mighty, they won't even question his presence. If they do, he has an ID card that says he's your former employer, Ethan."

I nodded again.

"Now Noah's important because Heath's specs show a particular kind of lock mechanism within the prison facility. They've created something that can't be picked, gamed, or stolen - he's probably your best shot for getting past if you can't talk your way deep enough." He sighed. "Okay, so this is all important because of our food situation. The farm worlds can produce an immense amount of food, but we've got six hundred billion people in fourteen realities, and more streaming in every day, so if we don't resolve this situation in two months or less -"

I held up a hand, speaking out of turn for the first time in my career - not because I wanted to interrupt, but because I believed that our young lieutenant needed the lesson. "With respect, sir, I'm just a soldier. I take orders. You've told me what to do, and I don't need the rest I don't need to know who we're saving, or why, or the situation at large. That will all just be a distraction."

He gulped back his next thoughts, and then nodded with dual understanding of both my words and my underlying message.

A rumbling sound echoed through the first floor, and dust sifted from overhead as the ground vibrated beneath our feet.

"We can't waste any more time. Let's begin."

Just like that, we were on our way.

Larry kept his lashless eyes narrowed, his sallow face compressed into an expression of open distrust and thinly veiled disgust. I called him Larry because his Yngtak name was literally unpronounceable.

I knew I needed to bridge the gap between us if our team effort was going to work out, but Danny spoke first. "You got a problem?"

Swaying with the truck's bouncing, and casually gripping the edge of the metal bed we were all riding in, Larry turned up his head. "That uniform - we know those who bear it as thugs, pillagers, and rapists."

Danny glanced over at me, then back. "Thompson didn't do anything like that. He wasn't even born a First Worlder."

How the hell had he known that? He seemed to know absolutely everything about me, even my most private thoughts. My suspicions kept returning to that strange book he'd read to clear me "It's true. I married into citizenship maybe fourteen years ago now. Never even knew the place existed before then, and didn't go there until about five years ago."

Even through the truck's uneven swaying on the dirt road, we felt the subtle vibration of another earthquake.

Larry took a deep breath, and then relaxed his oddly inhuman face. "I suppose neutrality shall be called between us."

Danny nodded with approval.

"What about you?" I asked. "One of your people inside the Shield is unheard of. Why are you here?"

He blinked those lashless lids a few times. I'd heard Yngtaks couldn't cry, but that must have been a mean-spirited rumor. His eyes did mist up very slightly. "No reason."

His answer gave me a terrible sinking feeling. It seemed none of the pillars of my life were sacred any longer. The Yngtak's home reality had always been a place of mystery, bright colors, and inverted crystalline palaces in the sky - their universe had a completely different set of physics that happened to converge in interesting ways with our own. There were no planets, and no stars, just light and clouds and floating chunks of gravity rock - well, that was what the popular rumors said, anyway. They'd also been the First World's eternal antagonists. If something terrible had happened to *them*, what hope did *we* have?

Noah sat in the corner of the truck bed, eyes distant. I couldn't get a read on him. He was a lonely man, from all that I could see about his manner, but not lonely in the sense that he wanted companionship. Wherever he stood, and whoever he looked at, he was a thousand miles away. Bouncing along in that truck next to him, I felt closer to the yellow-skinned and hairless Larry than I did to Noah.

But he was here, and he had chosen to go with me into a thousand unknown dangers. I decided to trust him.

The truck ahead of us, carrying Jay and his men, turned roughly before coming to a stop in an open field.

We followed, hopped down, and then hoofed it through the high stalks to a secret clearing.

Within stood many of the men and women from the command building - and Thomas, front and center.

I looked around in protective anger. He was absolutely *not* going with us into danger. What skills could he even offer?

Nervously, he stepped forward. "Okay, I'm gonna open one to the next farm reality, and then back to here but underground, at the portal place she went through."

What?

Was he -

I watched in amazement as he scrunched up his face, lifted a hand - and a wide oval in space opened in the middle of the clearing, leading to another field much like ours, but slightly different.

Stepping forward, I lifted a hand myself. "Christ - you're a brownshirt"

Danny stepped out to meet me. "You know of them?"

I couldn't help my expression. "They're on trial, too with the brigadier general, the Sword. They're all being blamed for causing the Crushing Fist."

Thomas held his hands to his mouth suddenly, and the portal flickered dangerously.

Danny got in my face, furiously pointed. "You're sure?"

"They're like me?" Thomas asked, from behind his hands, tears brimming up behind his glasses. "Alek said he saw them, but he didn't know where they went"

"They're in Teskoy, too," I said to all the watching faces.

Murmurs and exclamations followed.

"New objective," Danny called out, looking around, then at me. "I'm absolutely certain your intended target will already know about the brownshirts. While you're there, try to save Thomas' people, too."

I nodded. Save a woman who had crucial information about the Crushing Fist, save this young boy's people and one other objective, crystallized in cold fury in my heart.

Thomas lowered his hands, his eyes hard and hopeful behind his glasses. The portal stopped flickering and expanded another five feet.

He stepped through, and then Noah followed, leading Jay and his men through.

Danny held me back, stuffing my duffel bag into my hands. He spoke low enough to avoid being heard by anyone else. "There's a special book among your belongings. It will force the truth out of specific people. You said you took orders, and nothing else?"

I nodded, oddly proud of him.

He set his jaw with a rather murderous look. "I need you to use that book on the brigadier general, the one you told us about last night. I need to know the truth about how this all started."

Knowing that I was being watched by several onlookers, I kept my expression calm. "And if he *is* guilty?"

"My parents" he whispered, his body trembling with barely contained rage. "All our parents they just never came home one day. It's why we're here, and why we have nowhere else to go." He looked up at me, his eyes brimming with hot tears and a fury I'd felt only once in my life.

I nodded one last time. His order quite neatly lined up with the cold hate already in my heart. But, more than that somewhere inside me, slots still existed for paternal instinct, and, subsequently, action beyond all personal concerns. Thomas now held one of those slots in me, but this young man held another. There were men in Teskoy that deserved justice, and if that meant committing the unspeakable well, I *was* a soldier. "I understand sir."

He clasped my forearm, and I clasped his, and then I was off, expression neutral once more.

As I tread through the odd spectral blue portal, I noticed Noah look up and watch me from his position outside the group of men on the other side. There was no way he could know the icy storm inside me, but I turned away from him just the same.

Thomas clenched his fists, and the portal closed.

"Okay," he said, his tone still determined. "The facility" He closed his eyes, concentrating.

Another portal sprang up, opening among the wheat as an oval hole in space.

This one showed onto a dark concrete hallway. Within, a few spinning red emergency lights flashed at regular intervals. It was a portal hub facility alright, or, at least, a First World military installation. I still didn't trust these strange *blue* portals created by a boy rather than a miles-wide machine, but the first one had worked I stepped through, leading Noah and Larry.

I examined the colored lines on the wall. "Green line is the fastest way there." We moved forward, even as the radio at my belt crackled to life.

That same warm voice from before echoed through. "Alright, I'm logged in to the network there. I can activate the machines for you when you're ready. It's still aimed at exactly the place she went."

Trekking through the underground halls, we eventually came out into a tremendous tunnel containing several defunct rail lines. Hopping down and walking along them, we soon found the dome itself. Near the entrance, on the wall, someone had spray-painted two words in splotchy brown.

*WHY BOTHER?*

I thought, suddenly, of the intense apathy I'd seen rife in the First World. A searing hand gripped my entire body in place as I thought about those six hundred billion people streaming in on foot through cracking and collapsing realities. It was our military - our organization - that had always manned the outer Shield that protected the sphere of human influence. Where were they now?

The base the facility through which they'd exiled me there'd been nothing but a scattered few apathetic soldiers left.

Had we simply *given up?* We'd known about the Crushing Fist on the First World for years, but these people out here had had to find out about it on their own. Had we seen the oncoming doom and decided to hole up inside the inner golden Shield, letting the rest fend for themselves? To someone high up, it had probably seemed a simple decision. The First World couldn't house and feed ninety percent of the population it had - or, perhaps, it didn't want to - and adding nearly a trillion more human beings to that number would never have worked.

It was right there on the wall. If we couldn't stop the Crushing Fist, and couldn't save anyone, then *WHY BOTHER?*

I couldn't even fathom the depths of that monstrous decision. Looking over, I saw Noah watching me from the distance again, despite no outward expression of my absolute righteous fury. There were so many people that needed to be brought to justice I was beginning to feel like a raw nerve, or a predatory animal ready for murder.

Silently leading the way around the violet-and-white-lit dome toward the personnel access bridge, I grabbed a loose acceleration couch. "We have to bring this over and bolt it down."

They nodded, and the process took only a few minutes. We sat in expectant silence as Heath activated the machines. I spoke only as the terrible spinning began.

"This is always the worst part"

Noah and Larry just screwed up their faces against the uncomfortable force.

Violet and white light shot up in a tunnel around us as we descended - the spinning reached a near-blackout level of force - and then we were flung forward, stumbling roughly up by pure instinct.

At first, I thought we'd returned to the very grounds of the facility that had exiled me the day before - but this place was larger, and more populated. Where my exit path had been sparsely populated, this place had actual prompt guards. I knew this immediately - because they surrounded us with guns.

Angry shouting had already begun before I could even get my bearings. To his credit, Noah just smoothed his suit down, grinned at the guns in his face, and gingerly swatted them aside. He was playing his role perfectly - but so was Larry.

It was he that the guards feared, and I quickly raised his yellow hands to show the restraints I'd put on him before the trip. "Teskoy!" I shouted. "Escorting this highly valuable prisoner to Teskoy!"

It took several moments of confused looks and explanations to get the half-dozen men to back down. Their surprised hostility satiated, they released us to walk alone across the vast grounds. Only then did I get a better look at where we were.

We were adjacent to the palatial core of the city that I'd recently left. Gigantic skyscrapers towered high above us on three sides. On the fourth, golden clouds raced by at a rather disturbing speed. Blasting winds assaulted our faces, and the day was unseasonably hot and quiet.

"Is your world a desert?" Larry asked, lashless eyes concerned.

I shook my head as we forced our way forward through a particularly rough and searing gale. "This isn't right."

Noah said nothing, but he seemed to be scanning and taking in every detail he could. His face held a mask of richie callousness, but I knew he was as worried as I was.

Where had the specs shown the entrance? That way I moved toward it, acting like I'd taken the route many times before. We entered a fortified access building, and approached a vault-like door that lay half open.

A guard sat at a table, reading a book.

I frowned. I'd had a small hope reignited by the reaction to our sudden appearance - the military had actually done its job in a critical area - but here, in front of me, was a blatant return to that overwhelming apathy that seemed to have become a cancer on our once-great organization.

"Well, go on," he said, not looking up.

I took Larry past, and Noah sailed along behind, lighting a cigar as he did so.

Beyond the vault door stood a much smaller mechanical vortex machine - this one upright, so that it could be walked through. I hit the only button on the wall, and we waited as the thing spun to life. In a few short moments, a spinning violet circle appeared, showing onto grey hallways beyond.

We stepped through as one.

The mechanical vortex behind us slid to a halt, and the portal disappeared.

A blank wall stood behind us - it was part of their security procedures that the entry was one-way only. The hallway led forward into a waiting room and reception area where a bald man in uniform sat sleeping.

Noah glanced at me, and I frowned. Our complex plans and series of layered stories to talk our way into the prison were all proving pointless. In a way, this was worse, because it meant that the one organization in the multiverse potentially capable of doing something about the Crushing Fist had become a pathetic shadow of its former self.

I made a mental note to think about after the mission: the high technology and colossal equipment that had built all this, and which continued to run the worlds, still existed somewhere. If we had to, we could steal access and do it ourselves.

And who was maintaining the shattered fragments of the outer Shield? It was the only thing keeping any of us alive, and it required constant monitoring and daily management. Were there still people out on the borders of existence fighting the good fight despite Command's total abandonment?

Moving past the sleeping guard, and several empty posts, we came to a completely smooth metal rectangle. It looked like a door - but there didn't seem to be any way to open it.

Noah stepped forward. "Ah, I was hoping a guard would open it in front of us at least once."

"How's it opened?" I asked, recognizing the reason he'd come along.

 "There are sensors on the other side that monitor brain patterns," he explained, recalling from Heath's specs. "They are keyed to specific memories held by specific guards. For example, that sleeping guy back there might think of how he felt when his childhood dog died. That particular mix of emotions - very personal, impossible to replicate, and incommunicable through mere words - is each guard's key."

"So that's what Danny meant. It can't be picked, because the sensors are on the other side and you can't steal a key, and can't open it even if you know what the memory's supposed to be" I frowned. "So how are you going to get us through this door?"

His gaze seemed a thousand miles distant. "Emotions are all around us, all the time. They underpin existence itself. Just give me a second to feel this spot out. I'm not sure I can do something like this, but there's a chance."

Larry coughed, and stepped toward the smooth metal. "Excuse me, but this door is actually slightly open already."

He was right. I uncuffed him, and, together, we pulled the door fully open, each of us silently gnawed at by how strange and hopeless this all was.

The first area beyond was a vast helijet bay of sorts. Through several windows, we saw parked air shuttles beyond that, stormy ash clouds shot through by intermittent lightning.

Noah donned a grim expression. "If there's no reason to keep you up here, they just push you right out. They give you a parachute, and out you go"

I found a small window set in the wall itself. As Danny had said, we were a few thousand feet up, and all I could see out the thick glass were lightning-lit ash clouds and what looked like volcanic activity on a pock-marked surface far below. I couldn't imagine anyone surviving down there but the helijets spoke to the occasional retrieval for rare purposes.

The next section contained actual cells.

And it was here that I needed some time alone for my other objective.

"Let's split up," I suggested.

"That a wise idea?" Noah asked.

Larry waited for my answer.

"Doors open sleeping guards I don't think we're going to run into any threats here," I told them, using how I really felt to craft an effective excuse. "These people have simply given up."

They seemed to accept that answer with worried nods, and each picked a different hallway.

I moved quickly, gauging how long I might have to mete out justice through fury-fueled violence. I knew the Sword was here somewhere, and the brownshirts, and our intended rescue target. That was a great many people, and I reckoned correctly that Noah and Larry would be busy with at least some of them.

His cell was at the end of a long, empty hallway. He sat at the very back, arms around his legs, the same way I'd seen Thomas that morning. I found the gate controls at the front of the hall, hit his open, and returned quickly and quietly. I stepped inside as a hoary, thin, and long-bearded young man looked up in surprise. He was maybe twenty-four now, as I'd last seen him when he was just eighteen or nineteen.

"Blaku," I said quietly, my expression, I was sure, absolutely clear.

His jaw fell a little bit. "Thompson"

I remained standing, motionless. "Higgins said you were in here."

He nodded slowly. "They nabbed me when I tried to get here, to get safe from the shit going down out there."

"Stand up."

Trembling, he clambered to his feet, hands pressing against cold grey as if seeking safety. I think he knew that he was probably about to die.

But I had to be sure. Slipping my duffel bag down, I pulled out the book Danny had given me to find out the truth about the Sword. I would still do that, if I could, but nothing in existence could keep from doing this first. "Stay there. Don't move."

How did it work? Did I just open it up and start - yes. It had already anticipated exactly what I wanted to know.

---

I was bleeding from somewhere. That's all I knew. Warm liquid ebbed down from heated haziness in my head. Darkness was everywhere, and I ran.

The Ink gave way, and I stumbled face-first into hot desert sand, never more thankful for that burning irritation. I looked up to find guns pointed at me.

Something had attacked us in the Ink - something huge, something fleshy and tremendously strong. It had taken out a couple hundred men in a single swipe. The injured were streaming in from all along the wall of darkness and the Sword had ordered us all captured and treated as potential enemies.

They threw me in a tent with a dozen other guys under guard, and it took forever for the doctors to come around and treat and clear us.

Before the doctors, Thompson came by - the other Thompson, your ex-wife, and the head of the civilian consultants, the scientists and techs that had come along on many of our missions for reasons above my pay grade. She was a hard woman, but she seemed to care. She questioned each of us on what we'd seen and heard, and put together a model of some sort of titanic creature with mirrored skin.

I know how crazy that sounds, but all our stories fit together.

A few hours later, the LTs all got handed some new docs. It was plans - a method of attack on that mirrored beast, a potential way to kill it.

I'd been returned to my unit by that time. The muttering had already started. Why weren't we booking it? This situation was insane. Bring us home, and nuke the place!

Except all radiation and energy stopped after ten feet, someone reasoned. Any offensive in the Ink had to be taken step by step, on foot.

It made a sick sort of sense - we just didn't know *why* we were there, or what we were fighting for. A few guys from another unit got together and demanded an explanation.

The brigadier general had them immediately locked up and charged with mutiny.

You know what else the doctors kept doing? Brain scans. The paranoia was off the charts. It was like they had no idea what they were facing, like *anything at all could happen*, and that thought terrified us. The Ink seemed supernatural, and that meant all the training and skills we had were useless.

And, yet, we were being ordered back in.

I was still somewhat injured, so I got to sit out that day. I had to sit and listen as the step-by-step offensive began again. Mortars were fired, and a few jets even did flyovers. It was eerie, hearing nothing at all from inside that black valley

In orange evening light, I sat on a high dune and watched as a fleet of trucks dragged chains out of the Ink. At the end of those chains a ridiculously huge octopus-like thing with glowy orange flesh. It *was* mirrored, exactly as Thompson had suspected, and I could see the sunset flowing and radiating from it like some sort of weird dead reflecting pool.

But why? That's what we kept debating in the injured tent. What would a huge monster like that need mirrored skin for in total darkness?

The suggestion that shut us all up: maybe it didn't live in the Ink. Maybe it had wandered in just like us, from somewhere else.

The corpse sat like a mirrored mountain outside our vast camp. It didn't rot, didn't smell, and didn't decompose. It just sat there in the desert, a new landmark. As time went on, I began to think that we'd brutally killed an innocent creature that had just been defending itself

Each day brought new horrors. The deeper we penetrated into the Ink, the more nightmarish entities we ran across. Each new threat brought an immediate retreat, more losses, and a new plan from the civilian consultants. Each morning brought a calculated and brutal murder of the previous day's encounters.

Some deserved it more than others.

I was on foot in the cold sand, huddling in my bubble of light with one other guy, when the first neural mosquito floated by. We were three miles deep in the Ink, and something had been stalking the front line for the last several days leaving body parts of those who had died near the people they'd known so we were already on edge.

It floated into sight, and I shot it instantly.

It looked like a mosquito with a three-foot wingspan and it fell to the ground in a pile of ichor.

A thousand tiny little versions of that same creature swarmed up from inside its corpse, immediately going for the man with me as I ran.

I told the guys in the next light bubble back what I'd witnessed, and we watched in terror as my former bubble-mate entered our sphere with a casual smile. He strode toward us, acting perfectly normal but ignoring shouts to stop.

I didn't blame the men around me for opening fire on our comrade.

He fell to the ground, blood splattering and leaking out and hundreds of little insects swarmed out from his ears and nose.

We sent out radio warnings as we ran, and the whole line went into full retreat. Light bubbles flitted in and out of existence around me as I dashed across the sand, and shouts and gunfire echoed for staccato split-seconds with each flicker.

I made it out of the Ink proper with the last of my endurance, and fell to the sand once more.

Now, the brigadier general's precautions made sense but that meant that, while we'd been sent in largely blind to our objectives and potential threats, he'd known the entire time what we were facing.

Those who made it out of the Ink were again rounded up and shoved in quarantine but, this time, we were furious. There were ongoing shouts from a nearby tent, and the commotion sounded like it was approaching a real mutiny.

And who couldn't agree with them? Men and women were dying left and right. The Sword had insisted, multiple times, that what we were doing was of the utmost importance - but he wouldn't tell us why.

Do you understand how it feels when the organization that used to protect you and take care of you in exchange for your loyalty becomes something other? Something that uses you and discards you?

We weren't at the point of outright violence - not yet - but the anger was reaching a boil.

The next morning, we were all handed ear plugs, gas masks, and flamethrowers that had been air-dropped in special from somewhere.

The neural mosquitoes didn't stand a chance, and each man became his own source of light as we burned our way deeper into the Ink.

It was about that time that we noticed we were heading down steeper sandy slopes, and we'd reached a point further into the Ink than the Ink was wide. Nervous jokes began passing around the radio that we were fighting our way straight to Hell and I honestly wasn't sure that wasn't really the case.

But something down there *mattered*, in a grand sense. The Sword had promised us that much, and we could feel it in our approach. Something had fallen to Earth here - something horrible beyond all imagining - and we'd seen, each and every day, what *not* dealing with it would bring.

But that didn't stop the resentment in us growing as each new threat attacked us in unexpected ways each day.

We began hearing our fallen comrades calling to us by radio. Anyone who went after those voices joined them in calling out to us, and we never saw them alive again.

We started having visions of ourselves as children, in a gigantic church, listening to sermons about the grace of God - but no God you want to know about. Thing is, in those visions, *you believed.* You did. That God existed, no doubt, and he hated you and all life.

The ear plugs initially intended for the neural mosquito threat helped, but the Unholy Word went straight to your brain. Nine percent of any group sent down into the Ink - *nine percent* - became converts and attacked their fellows.

We started going out in distinct groups of eleven or less. Whatever the effect was, it didn't round up, so to speak. If a twelfth man wandered near, almost immediately, one of us went nuts

I spent many of my nights crying in my bunk, wracked by the sheer random terror of it all. Why had I survived as long as I had? We'd lost forty percent of the initial number we'd arrived with, and it all seemed random. I used to joke. I used to laugh. They called me a prankster, even, for some of the stunts I'd pulled.

But I didn't laugh anymore. I'd seen too many limbs presented as torturous gifts, heard too much unholy preaching, gunned down too many of my own squadmates who'd been converted or had their brains eaten or -

I think many of us hit a wall at the same time.

I slogged out of my bunk one morning - my tent empty except for me - and realized that I was the only member of my squad still alive. Nobody had come to wake me up because our officers hadn't even known I was still there.

Standing in the sand like a hollow zombie, I looked around and saw the same expression in faces all around me.

"Let's go," an officer shouted. "Let's move!"

I'm not even sure who said it first. We all just remained where we stood.

"No."

"No?" the officer asked, approaching with fury.

Nobody responded.

He shouted his best at us, but none of us had the strength to comply. Eventually, the problem moved up the chain, and the entire camp came to a halt as the refusal-by-spiritual-exhaustion spread.

The brigadier general himself stepped out of his tent and walked among us, his expression grim behind his beard. He regarded many of us directly, sizing us up. Finally, he said to one particular man: "You have concerns?"

I don't think you guys are reading these emails, but, I suppose, if any of us survive this, every detail will be important for posterity. And I guess this is just for me, more than it is for you, as I try to make sense of all this.

And, anyway, I can't sleep.

Grimy kids paused their soccer game in the street to make way for shiny red sleekness. As I was picking my way around crowded sleepers and layabouts, a Lamborghini pulled right up to the cracked stoop of my building.

A chiseled twenty-five-year-old face became visible as its owner leaned over and peered out the passenger-side window. Ethan grinned. "You gonna walk to your own redeployment? Come on, friend."

Friend? We'd joked at times, but I wouldn't have called us friends still, he'd been my boss for several years, and I didn't want to burn that bridge. I stepped to the front, he popped the trunk, and I unceremoniously threw my duffel bag under the hood and closed it.

As I climbed in and pulled down the door, he greeted me with a raised eyebrow. "Not a car fan?"

I shook my head slightly.

He shrugged and started pulling forward slowly, inching his way through the crowded streets. It'd been many years since I'd been in a car here, and I had a distinct impression that I was suddenly back in Cairo or the Sudan or any of the other places I'd been sent.

That impression faded as we left the poor areas and pulled onto a wide, smooth highway that held little traffic. Ethan hit a button, and the roof automatically folded back into the rear of the vehicle, and just like that, we were sailing along a windy path through the golden sky. The highway had been cleverly constructed to hide the ghettos underneath while showcasing the enormous glinting buildings that towered high above, both downtown and lining the suburb outskirts of the city. From our vantage point, the city seemed like an arc of valleys inside a giant circle of towering monoliths, with a palatial core in the middle.

"I never got to truly thank you for how you handled that business with my mother," Ethan said loudly, donning a pair of sunglasses while keeping his eyes on the road.

I kept my eyes averted out of force of habit. "Just doing my job."

"I'm not your boss anymore," he replied, glancing over at me. "You don't have to stay humble. Do you want a million dollars?"

That got me to look back at him. "What?" A flood of revulsion overcame me as I thought about how money made people act. I'd stood idly by through a litany of scenarios I hoped to forget, protecting those that others might have enacted justice upon. "No."

"That's why I like you," he laughed, hitting my shoulder briefly. "Everyone here's obsessed with money - either having it or getting it - but you you stand apart." He glanced over again. "Why is that?"

I just kept my eyes on the passing stream of lines on the highway.

"You see some shit out there?" he asked. When I didn't respond, he shrugged it off. "Anyway. This is totally a screw job, right?"

Turning my head suddenly, I stared at him. I'd suspected that the very swift response to my questions - and my sudden redeployment - were a retaliation intended to get rid of me. I just hadn't expected him to know or care.

"I'm not blind," he said. "I just happened to mention your concerns because they came to mind randomly, and because I happened to be drunk - and the way those big-wigs reacted, you'd have thought I'd shot their dog. And then you're being redeployed the next day well."

I didn't quite know what to say, or how to react. Thankfully, we were already pulling toward an exit ramp. Walking, it would have taken quite some time, but we'd reached the military complex just outside the suburban skyscraper homes in a few scant minutes.

Ethan waved his way past a surprised guard at the gate, and then parked wherever he felt like. Trekking across the eerily empty parking lot, I made my way toward the main building, memories of this place surging in my head. It had been much livelier, back then a few scattered souls wandered the grounds, without any of the haste and urgency I remembered.

Inside, a guard sat reclining at a small security desk, a book in hand. A pile of lanyards lay in a box near his feet.

When he didn't react to us at all, I reached for one hesitantly.

"Don't bother with that," Ethan said, pulling me on. "Who cares?"

The guard didn't seem to, that was for sure. He only briefly glanced up at us as we walked past without any authorization or cue.

"Do you know where you're going?" I asked.

Ethan laughed, and then smoothed his suit reflexively. "Nope. Do you?"

"Yeah - this way, I think." I headed down the maze of hallways, wondering why the place was so poorly manned and so poorly kept. This had been a hub of activity when I had first enlisted but that had been a great many years ago. Maybe they'd moved operations somewhere else?

There it was: the elevator down. I had my orders, and I knew where to go we crossed a wide staging courtyard, and headed for two vast metal doors that slid apart slowly after I pulled a grip handle.

The enormous grated elevator accepted us without complaint, and I hit the button for the lowest floor.

"You just have to find your own way around this place?" Ethan asked.

I didn't have an answer for him, or for myself. "Guess so"

After a few minutes spent descending, we were finally greeted by someone. An older man, white-haired and uniformed, stood outside the wide doors as they slid apart. "Thompson?"

I stood at attention. "Reporting."

The older guard looked over at Ethan, noted his fine clothes, healthy face, and casual demeanor, and decided not to ask him any questions. "This way."

Heading down wide concrete corridors and stepping past boxes, gear, and supplies, we made our way to the gigantic underground dome that I vividly remembered. Still lit in white and violet, it, too, ran far more sparse than it should have. A few burly soldiers lounged over at the gigantic logistics entrance, and a couple techs sat at the control station.

Those burly soldiers began heading around the edge of the dome toward us.

The white-haired guard began tiredly going down a checklist of things to say. "Do you have any large metal objects on your person?"

"No," I replied, still studying the vast chamber.

Successive metal plateaus descended in a miles-wide approximation of a mechanical vortex. Each spun idly, and at different rates. In the distant center stood a platform sense memories welled up, and I almost felt physically ill just looking at it.

"Do you have any weapons with you?"

I shook my head. "No."

The large soldiers finally reached us. One took my duffel bag and rooted through it, while another patted me down.

"Have you recently had any head injuries?"

"No"

"Life-threatening illnesses - ah, the hell with it. You're fine, right?"

Arms held high while being patted down, I looked over at him and tried not to sound sarcastic. "Yeah."

"Here are your official orders." After he handed me a small paper, he rubbed one hand through his short white hair, grimacing. "So we're only sending you one step out, but there's nobody on the other side to help you set up a return trip. Maybe some techies that run the farm systems, but I don't really know how you're going to get back. We don't really send people out anymore. Boy, you musta pissed someone off."

I'd expected a screw job, but this? Jaw set, I realized why they'd had so many burly men surround me. I also wondered what the hell that meant for the military if there was nobody manning the sister installation for this facility. Well, then, I'd just have to find one of the others when it was time to return or he couldn't mean that *all of them* had been abandoned, could he?

Finished checking my belongings and person, the soldiers stepped back, but maintained a close vigil.

Patting one of them on the shoulder condescendingly, Ethan stepped through their little circle and approached me. "Well then, seems this is where we part ways." He reached into his suit, lifted out a small box, and then freed a cigar. Upending it, he slid it into the front pocket of my uniform, and patted it. "One last cigar for the best bodyguard in town. You really should quit smoking, though. That stuff'll kill you."

Saying nothing, I just nodded. I didn't smoke, and he knew that - he'd tried to get me to light up with him and his richie pals on many occasions. It had become a running joke between us wait had we actually been friends?

I would never know, now. The soldiers escorted me away, taking me quickly around the perimeter of the vast machine. They stayed with me as I walked across the personnel access bridge, and made sure to strap me in tight to the acceleration couches on the central platform.

And, just like that, I was set for a ride I'd thought I'd never take again. I wasn't thinking about anything that I was leaving behind. There was nothing left for me here. For as lauded as it was, the First World was full of toil, humiliation, and pain for anyone that wasn't rich. Even despite all that, life here as a poor person had been better than life for anyone else out there - or so we were constantly told - so I still knew that what I was doing was foolish.

I was basing major changes in my life on the need to uncover the truth about events that were now five years past. I knew it was stupid, going back out into danger, but *what else was there?* Was this search just an excuse, because I'd reached my limit for enduring my life here? Or was finding the truth, in some obscure manner, a way for me to feel like Cristina hadn't yet truly died? As long as mystery remained, her story was still alive and changing

The mechanical vortex below me began revving up, and the sickening spinning started to gradually build nausea in my stomach.

God, this was always the worst part I kept my eyes open throughout, focused on violent violet and flashing white light until the tunnel of energy roared around the descending platform and swallowed everything whole.

The moment came startlingly quickly - the chair's restraints fell away, left behind in ways geometric and inexplicable, and I stumbled to my feet. Staggering forward, I tilted over roughly with the rushing force of the tunnel behind me, and then I caught my balance as it surged backward and disappeared. Purple light faded - and I found myself standing in a grove of tall trees that were still bending and swaying in the sudden wind.

I braced myself first against the ebbing tide of nausea, and then against the fact that I was touching a tree. The cool, rough bark felt alive and organic under my hand. Staring up, I realized that I was practically surrounded by trees... and I realized, too, that I'd missed them terribly living in a city slum. And the sky -!

Past the glowing green canopy, searing bright blue danced in patterns that moved with the wind. Laughing, I grabbed my duffel bag and stumbled through the underbrush, seeking the curtain of light I could sense ahead. The trees gave way to vast open fields of wheat, swaying amber under the Sun. This was a farming bastion, one of many surrounding the First World itself, and safest, as yet, from the effects of the Crushing Fist.

I couldn't see much among the high stalks, but I already surged with more vitality than I'd felt in years.

What did my orders say? I hefted my duffel bag back a bit, freed my arm, and used both hands to pull the paper open.

Right.

It was blank.

It was, as Ethan had put it, a screw job.

But had I really had a choice? The slightest legal conflict would have cost everything I had, and I still probably would have been forced to plea bargain and spend decades in jail. At least this way, the walls were reversed - I couldn't go home, but I could go *absolutely anywhere else.*

I dropped the blank paper among the wheat and dirt.

Acting on curious instinct, I reached in my pocket and pulled out Ethan's cigar. Running my fingers along it, I looked for any irregularity - there. Cracking the cigar apart, I extracted a small metal chip.

It held a series of delicate engravings, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Relying on his social position to afford certain antics, he'd very purposefully snuck this into my possession after the soldiers had gone through everything else I owned

If he'd gone through all that trouble, it seemed likely that I would come across a use for it. I made sure to hide it well.

Pushing through the fields, I happily made my way forward. A single loud screech echoed out from somewhere distant, like rending metal, but I ignored it. Even that phenomenon wasn't nearly as annoying out here among growth and life

I stopped when I came to the road, immediately floored.

Thousands of people walked by at a languid pace, carrying children, belongings, and food.

There wasn't supposed to have been anyone here only a few techs running the global farming systems taking care not to stick out, I immediately joined with the procession, walking on down the road.

"You a soldier?" a young boy asked, hand-in-hand with his mother. Blonde locks held up under a tied cloth, her face tired, she shifted her backpack and looked up at me. Her eyes went wide.

"I was," I replied, looking down at him.

His mother walked a little closer. "I hate to be so direct, but do you mind walking with us for a while? He's been scared ever since we left home. His daddy was a soldier, so you being here might calm him down."

"Sure." I looked up the road, past the crowds, but I couldn't yet see our destination. I wasn't sure I could ask about it without sounding out of place. "You had a rough walk?"

She nodded slowly, and wiped sweat from her brow. Ten years ago, she might have been extremely pretty. Now, more than anything else, she just seemed exhausted. What had happened to all these people? "Well, we've sure got the time. I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours."

The little boy held out his free hand, and I took it. The act hit me somewhere surprising, and I blinked away a slight moisture. It'd been a very long time since I'd held a child's hand like a father another life, really. "Alright."

She sighed, and then began telling her tale.

---

Have you ever been in love?

I can see that you have.

We had love.

His father was overseas when that horrible sound began. At first, it was only every couple days I heard it in the dog park, once, and then again at the store.

I knew the situation was real once my friends brought it up at book club and once we all realized that *absolutely nobody on television was talking about it.* All the same talking heads as usual were discussing beauty care, politics, and new book releases. That was probably the scariest part of all a sudden sharp disconnect between what we thought TV was, and what it really turned out to be. I stopped letting my son watch it when I realized that there were people out there *deciding what we should see, hear, and talk about*.

And those people didn't want us talking about that noise.

The police started getting incredibly scary, too, all hopped up in military gear. It wasn't to protect against some unknown threat, though, but to keep us orderly and doing as we were told when the earthquakes started.

It was obvious to everyone that something terrible was building, but we didn't have any idea what to do about it - and the TV just kept on chattering like nothing was wrong.

That's when I got a video message from my husband

No, I'm alright. Just overcome thinking about it for a second.

I got a video message from my husband, and he was basically saying goodbye. He was on the east coast of Africa somewhere, and it was on fire *green fire* freezing everything as it went. Yeah, impossible, right? But he showed me. And he told me to take our son, take anything I could get, and make a run for it.

The neighborhood hadn't been hit by any earthquakes, but it had been looking pretty sparse for a few weeks before that. It was as if people were disappearing one by one and, after that message, I went around knocking on doors.

I got through most of the street without a single answer. I was worried that, somehow, I was the only one left in the world - where had everybody gone? But I caught Mary Jo just as she was leaving with her two girls. She looked terrified half-to-death, but she was keeping it together in front of her kids. I didn't *really* believe her when she told me, but what choice did I have? She gave me two minutes, and I ran and grabbed Caleb and anything I could carry.

Police tanks were rolling through at the time, trying to keep people from leaving, but they just missed us. Mary Jo said she wouldn't have left without me, but she had thought that she was already the last one. That made me a little sick, wondering - had *we* left someone behind with the same mistake? - but I would never know.

True as her word, there it was: a crack in the world. The gossip grapevine had reached almost everyone one at a time, one-on-one, family to family and friend to friend. We had to leave her car at some distance and go on foot - it was like heading to a festival, and that's what I told Caleb we were doing. People were streaming along the sidewalks, tensely eyeing everyone around them for fear of the police and the wealthy-turned-warlords that controlled them.

We heard them showing up a half-mile behind us, but it was too late.

While the crack looked terrifying, all wavy and blurry and randomly glinting, it was just like turning a corner. We walked down a grass-lined path between two suburban houses, and then - walked out into a different backyard. The trees were slightly different colors, and the clouds a different shade of grey, but it was just like the neighborhood we'd left behind.

The crowd kept streaming in a specific direction, and we followed, not sure what else to do. Mary Jo stuck close, and we talked in whispers whenever the kids got distracted by something. None of the other people in the crowd knew anything, either, except that they were following the people in front of them just like those people were, and the people ahead of *them.*

And we soon found out why. There was another crack, this one hidden in a grove of trees somewhat near where our house had been in our world, or our reality, or wherever it was that we'd fled from. I begged Mary Jo to wait for us, and she begged me not to go, but I had to - I took Caleb and we ran to see our house.

It was *exactly the same* - in exactly the way I'd hoped.

Henry sat on the porch, face in his hands. I remember my heart skipping a beat as I saw him. He looked up, and then stood roughly, knocking over his chair.

He ran to me, half-crying, asking how it was possible. I just shook my head and he explained that he'd just seen the video message *I'd* sent from Brazil, where *I* had been serving in the military, and where a losing battle was being fought against a continent-wide swarm of some sort of horrific rapidly multiplying insects

He wasn't my husband, and I wasn't his wife.

I understood, then, exactly what we'd done by fleeing through that crack. And yet even as we stood there, the ground rumbled and shook. He tried to hold me close, but I pulled away. This place wasn't safe, either, and it wasn't my home.

I just shook my head, pulled Caleb away from him, and ran.

Mary Jo had waited for us, one daughter gripped in each hand. She didn't ask what I'd seen - she could guess.

We streamed with the crowd through to the next place, where organized men and vehicles were waiting for us.

They weren't like the militarized police we'd left behind, though. These people were just normal guys in pickup trucks. God bless those men. They handed out food, continually gave directions and instructions, and kept people on the right track. The rumor among the walking crowd was that somebody had come through and warned them. Their world was already empty, because they'd already evacuated everyone other than a skeleton crew of volunteers.

That's where we're going, you see. The people that came through and warned them had gone ahead of everyone else, and they're supposedly set up in some safe realities ahead.

But it wasn't easy going from there. Given the fractured path ahead of us, nobody could really be in charge, because nobody knew what to expect. All we could do was stick close to the people around us, communicate about *everything*, and try to work our way through.

The cracks weren't always quick affairs, either. Some of them were extremely long, like the two realities had pulled away from each other, and the space in between was 

Sorry it's just hard to think about again.

If you looked up at the raving in-betweens, you went insane. Just like that. That's all anyone knew. *Don't look up.* Hard to do that with all the horrible noises, blasting winds, and strange smells assaulting you. I held a hand over Caleb's eyes and tried to make a game out of it, but I think he knew something was terribly wrong. All I could do was stare down at my feet and push forward.

It looked like a parking lot. Isn't that weird? Just gray, flat stone that went on and on. Mary Jo said it looked like an endless grassy lawn to her. I suppose it wasn't really ground at all, at least not like we know. 

I don't know how long it took to reach the other side. Twenty minutes? Thirty? It honestly seemed like forever. I thought my heart was going to explode from anxiety. Still, we made it, and took a rest at the triage where they were taking care of the unfortunate men and women that *had* looked up at the raving in-betweens.

And then there was the rumor that had started making rounds after the world with the nice men in pickup trucks. They'd apparently said that *someone or something was after us*, or at least trying to figure out where we were going, and they'd been instructed not to tell anyone who came later where we'd gone.

That one still makes it hard to sleep. Who would be after us? Could it be the wealthy men that had used the crisis to amass power? Fat lot of good that'd done them, since we'd just left their little global kingdom on foot. Or was it something worse? I couldn't stop thinking about those two incidents that made no natural sense: green ice flames, and an invasion by impossible insects. Just what was happening here?

And then it hit me: if we were walking between realities, were other things walking into *ours?* Well there could just plain be *anything!* I was never a science fiction type, but my husband had made me watch some. The thought that those rubber-headed aliens, or worse, might be real well that just made me shudder every time it occurred to me.

And then we hit a bad one.

It looked like a battlefield, like from the movies. Crushed buildings, random fires bodies I had to hide Caleb's eyes again, making up yet another game to keep him from being suspicious.

There were people all around normal guys, not soldiers firing weapons at something close and aiming mortars at something on the horizon. It was - God, it was unthinkable - all I saw was a mechanical leg the size of a mountain. It moved, and clouds dashed around it what the hell could that have been? It made earthquakes with each motion; earthquakes even stronger than the ones we'd been feeling.

And, on the burning city streets, mangled and bloodied people came at us like they were mindless and rabid. The weirdest part? When they were between the fires, and not directly illuminated, they just disappeared.

They'd show up again fifty feet closer, in someone's face, and there would be more screaming and gunfire and swinging machetes 

But many of the guerrillas rushed us forward, while pushing the rest of the line back into the crack.

I remember that shout: "*You'll have to find another way!* It's not safe here!"

I remember it vividly, because Mary Jo and her daughters were among the people being pushed back. I started to run to her, but the men pushed us forward roughly, and pointed guns at us to make us keep moving.

"There's no time," one said calmly, his eyes hard. "You have to go."

And it was Henry again.

Before I could pull myself back together, he'd already pushed Caleb and I - and the tail end of our line - through to the next place.

After that, things settled down a little. It seemed like we were out of the direct warzones. It was just walking, and crying, and exhaustion and then, more walking. The cracks started growing more distant from one another with each new place. Some took that as a good sign, but, to me, all it meant was that we were walking from Topeka to Dallas, and then up to Oklahoma City, and then west, to Phoenix.

When we hit the arid places, the deserts, we started losing people.

At first, it was the old and infirm. We hadn't properly gauged their need for water and then, the water started running low. Sometimes, local citizens helped out, but, more often than not, we found closed doors and unhappy frowns. I couldn't begrudge them, really. They didn't have the resources to help the ongoing stream of people. How many had they seen? Thousands? More?

I left signs made of rocks for Mary Jo sometimes, but we were still at the tail end of the line, and I had no idea if she would be coming our way, or if she would understand them.

We were seeing less people, too. Other than the few recalcitrant landowners that remained to frown on us, the roads were empty of traffic, and the cities quiet.

They'd all gone ahead.

Of course, we thought of looting the cities we passed through. We had to do it. Thing is somebody had left out crates of water bottles, and piles of canned food. They *all* had. Person to person, human being to human being, people had left what they could spare. It was heartwarming, and just what we needed to come back from exhausted depression.

We didn't know who had left whatever it was we would eat or drink each night, but we were thankful. I did try to investigate the houses nearby for names, but there was no time to dilly-dally.

Our line had become more of a knot of folk, made up mostly of the people we'd started with. Somehow, at some point, we'd lost sight of the people ahead, and perhaps taken a different route based on signs and papers others had used to mark the way. At times, out of energy, we would camp for a day or two just rest, enjoy the different skies and strange new places but, always, there were those awful rending sounds, and the tremors. They were weaker the more we walked, but they were always there.

I started to think it would never end. I really did. The days and the weeks had blurred together, and there was no way to know anymore what date it was. Even the newspapers had stopped printing at some point, so anything we found was out of date.

Just as I thought to split from the group and set up a new home somewhere there it was. We were walking through an empty Los Angeles when we turned a corner and found a quiet and endless parade of tired folk. It was the line, and we'd met back up with it.

Caleb thought we'd won the game, and, in a way, we had. I was too tired to remember what I'd told him, specifically, but he accepted ice cream as a prize. I broke into a dusty shop and found some. It was freezer-burned, after so long in there, but the electricity was still being maintained by someone, and the freezer had still been on.

And it was the best damn ice cream I've ever had in my life.

---

"Ooh, you swore!" Caleb interrupted.

"Hah, sorry," she laughed.

I looked down at his face, where bits of chocolate still remained. "So that was just now?"

"Earlier today," she replied, smiling nostalgically. "I shoulda taken more, but it would have just melted out here on these beautiful plains"

As we walked, a rust-spotted pickup truck rolled along the line and stopped a bit ahead. A grizzled old man with long white hair held up a box from among a large stack. "Food? Any y'all need food?"

The crowd surged forward, but lines quickly formed. I was rather impressed - for a small moment, I'd feared a riot. These people had all been thrust into a common situation and they'd had to work together to survive. A riot wouldn't help anyone.

Caleb kept a grip on my hand, and I found myself pulled forward.

As another man climbed out of the truck and started passing down food, the older one eyed me from above. He spoke with what sounded like a Southern accent, possibly Alabama or one of the Carolinas. Like these people, he must have come quite far "What uniform is that, son?"

Wary, I gave him as generic an answer as possible without sounding rude. "Military."

"Ya got trainin'?"

"Yes, sir."

"Ya wanna talk to the higher-ups? We could use yer skills."

I didn't want to attract attention but, at the same time, the grand scale of the situation had not been lost on me. I hadn't heard a word of this mass inward exodus while living in the First World.

And I had burning questions of my own, besides.

"Sure."

"I'll give ya a ride then."

I nodded, taking his hand to climb past the gathered crowd and into the truck bed. "Mind giving a ride to my friend and her son, too?"

"Sure. Which 'uns?"

Turning, I scanned the throngs of hungry faces. I didn't see her in the immediate vicinity, and I started looking for blonde hair until I realized that she'd had a cloth bundling it up. The sea of people stretched to the horizon in both directions, and she was moving somewhere among them. I'd only looked away for a second -

My heart seized with cold pain. *Not again!*

"I don't see her."

The old man kneeled at the edge of his truck bed. "What's 'er name?"

I opened my mouth to speak, but froze. "I I never got her name"

"Well, that's a rough 'un. We gotta go though, get more food." He sighed. "Keep an eye out for 'er, alrite? You might see 'er."

Feeling a little sick, I sat, and kept my eyes on the passing crowd as the truck roared to life and started rolling forward. Just like that, she was gone but she would be fine, as long as she was with all these people. I kept telling myself that as we sped along, and as any hope of finding her and Caleb dwindled to zero.

The fields roiled like an amber ocean, and the Sun begin dipping a little lower in the sky. I kept my eyes on the walking crowd for no real reason, my gaze distant.

Eventually, the fields abruptly ended. We rolled right into flat, dead plains - the usual staging area for the farm machine systems. Now, though, the vast swaths of empty space were all filled with people - men setting up tents, women doing laundry in basins of water, kids playing, and older folk knitting or cooking. It was, as Caleb's mother had said, kind of like a festival except enormous, and ongoing. This festival would not end at dark, and nobody would get to go home.

"Got a pecul'ya one for ya," my driver called out as we pulled up to a tech-center building roughly the size of a suburban house. It was built of squat stone, and had been constructed to withstand the elements. Now, it seemed to serve as a headquarters of sorts.

Several burly men emerged - and one even had the same face as one of the men who had strapped me in earlier that day. I tried not to laugh. It was said that duplicates were often eerily similar, but I was in great need of humor at that moment, and couldn't help but crack a smile against the chill in my heart.

"What are you smilin' at?" he asked, but I just shook my head and dropped to a neutral expression.

Instead of taking me inside, we waited, and they asked me several questions, relaying the answers back along hand-held radios.

After several minutes, the person on the other end emerged.

I frowned.

It was some *kid* - a boy in his upper teens, on the cusp of manhood, probably barely old enough to enlist. In his hands, he held a curious book.

"Hold him," the kid ordered.

Suddenly, strong hands gripped my arms. I didn't resist, instead opting to wait and see what was happening.

He opened the book and leafed through it, reading quickly and diligently. I wasn't sure what he was doing. Possibly looking up procedures, or maybe trying to identify my uniform?

While we waited, I glanced over - and my blood ran cold. Among the men inside a large command tent that had been set up against the tech building, there stood one strikingly different figure. His skin was light yellow, and his features ran sharply angular. Were things really so bad that a Yngtak was *here?* He looked over at me he saw my uniform and his lash-less eyes narrowed.

That was it - time to resist!

Just as I steeled myself for a struggle and a fight, the teenager with the book made an exclamation. "Holy shit - do you know who this guy is?" He pulled out his radio. "Guys, we gotta talk."

What? What had he read in that book?

Forceful hands released me, and I moved forward with the guards, entering the tech building proper behind the young man who had cleared me for some reason. It was darker inside, and my eyes needed a second to adjust but I saw a wide screen set in the wall first.

On it, a vast sphere made of connected smaller spheres slowly rotated.

"What is that?" I asked, heart pounding.

The young man looked at the screen, his expression grim. "That's us."

"That's all the realities inside the Shield," I breathed, my head spinning. "I've never seen it illustrated quite like that."

He nodded.

They let me walk forward to study it in greater detail. A single sphere in the very center remained unmapped - the First World. Tiny dots marked us, right outside and a few green spheres denoted the relatively safer realities in deep - the farming worlds, and a few scattered others. A few spheres at key spaced points in the structure were lit in amber. I decided to ask about them first, before the other, more horrible question.

"What are these ones?"

He tilted his head. "Not sure. Call them *read-only* - we can get information from them, but we can't contact them directly. They seem to be completely safe, and completely unaware that anything is wrong."

That was surprising I hadn't heard anything about that in the First World, either. I prepared myself for the worse question. "These ones the ones in red," I asked, pointing at the tremendous number of red spheres that seemed to follow five major lines throughout the structure. It wasn't a fist, not really, but I could see why everyone called it that it looked like a small globe had been caught in a vast gripping angry hand.

"It's the screeching noises," he replied, face grey. "The sound of reality itself compressing. It's the earthquakes the planet physically adjusting." He swallowed once before giving me the full answer - the answer I already knew just from seeing it pictured so. "Bit by bit, we are *literally being crushed.*"

I could only stare. This was the truth, in all its horrible glory. The media in the First World depicted it as the end of everything, but they'd always said that the golden inner Shield would protect the heart of humanity. Even if it did how many people right outside the walls would find themselves sacrificed for the survival and comfort of the wealthy lords of the human race?

My fists were already clenched before the emotion fully reached my thoughts.

"Thinking about helping out?" he asked.

I glared at the screen, imagining those assholes in bathing suits smoking cigars poolside at that very moment while millions suffered just the other side of a dimensional wall. "Maybe. What's the plan?"

"Well you just came from there -" he said, pointing at the dark innermost sphere. "Mind helping us break back in?"

I hadn't even been exiled for twenty-four hours. "It's not possible."

"We'll see. And more than that, we need to break into a prison."

That caught my attention. "Which one?"

"Don't you guys only have one? A pocket reality that's never been escaped from?" He looked at a laptop on a table nearby. "Teskoy? I know it sounds daunting, but we could really use your help."

Cold fury. That was all I could feel in that moment. It was all too large. I couldn't make anyone pay for the lies, or for exiling me, or for how they'd abandoned humanity out here but there was one man I *could* bring justice. It was important, though, that they didn't know why I was helping. They wouldn't understand. "Alright. I'm in."

	<TITLE> [REPOST] I was told that everyone I'd served with in the military died shortly after I left. Today, I saw one of my old squadmates, homeless, digging through the trash behind a convenience store. He had an unbelievable tale to tell. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm reaching out to you guys - if any of you still check these old email addresses - because I think we've been lied to. I'm hoping some of you might know something, or have some contacts you can ask to find out more. I'll start at the beginning.

I saw Higgins out back of a 7-11, rooting through the dumpster. Yes, *that* Higgins, the quiet one. He was a sorry sight, like most these days, but he was better than dead.

He saw me, and I know he recognized me. He ran, and ducked into the aft-streets. I thought: I'm not stupid. I'm not going back there. I did just go home but it gnawed at me, seeing him like that. He was dirty, haggard, and hungry but he wasn't dead.

I didn't sleep that night. I simply lay in bed and stared at the ceiling, trying not to wake any of my roommates. I was confused at first, and then suspicious and then angry. How long has it been? Four years? Five? They told us that everyone in that brigade had died.

But Higgins hadn't.

If they'd lied about him, what were the chances the rest was a lie, too?

It was strange, suddenly having a purpose again. I was exhausted, but I felt clear. I managed to carefully step my way across the room as soon as the Sun came up without waking anyone. I didn't even mind the crowd outside - some kid offered to sell me one of a dozen makeshift Crushing Fist action figures he'd made, and I actually gave him a dollar. It just didn't matter. Something in me had snapped, and I was done with futilely trying to scrimp and save for a future that would never come.

I've been employed the last few years as a bodyguard for a richie. His name's Ethan. He's not the worst, as richies go. He's still an asshole, though. I had to go to work before anything else, and go to work I did. This time, though, I was a new man. I kept my face stone, but my ears sharp.

He and his richie friends lounged by the pool for hours that day. Their topics of conversation, aside from group drama, revolved mainly around some dramatic Trial of the Decade I couldn't care less about, those annoying screeching sounds that, quote, *somebody should do something about* and a Crushing Fist-themed party they were going to attend later that week.

I don't think they know anything. Their days are filled with ennui and bullshit.

But somebody knows something. They have to. Ethan always said that he'd help me out if I ever wanted to get back into the military. I don't know if he meant it, but I brought it up with him at the end of my shift. He grinned, puffed a cigar, and promised he'd talk to somebody. I don't know if he will, but it wasn't a refusal

I went back to the aft-streets that night. Higgins had seemed weak and hungry. He couldn't have gone far - but that didn't mean the search would be easy. There were thousands of them down there, among the rubble of the latest earthquake, and he didn't want to be found.

It took me until midnight to find him, catch him, and force the story out of him. He didn't want to tell me, and he said he'd get in trouble if he did - but how could his situation get any worse?

---

After you left, Thompson, everything went to shit. I haven't told anyone what happened, not in the least because I don't want them to know I'm here. I'd rather be homeless in the First World than set up like a king out there in the doomed lands, eh?

Ok, ok, jeez. Relax.

You left. You quit. I get it. Any man would have done the same. But we were still out there in the desert the Middle East, or thereabouts.

I can't quite believe it's been almost five years. I remember that morning like it happened earlier today. We woke up, we did the rounds, we went on patrol and there it was.

Darkness. Right out there in the goddamn sand. Miles wide, just *sitting there*, like a landlocked black mountain.

Now there'd already been some questionable orders from the brigadier general - you know, a recent subtle anger, a bit of disdain - but he'd always done right by us. We trusted him. Still, it didn't make sense. He ordered us into that shit to capture some oil well or something. He figured the rebels that controlled it at the time had hightailed it because of the darkness. Yeah. That much made sense. But if everyone else had run away, why were we fuckin' walkin' into it?

UAVs that flew in went dark almost instantly - but they eventually popped out the other side unharmed, having recorded nothing but blackness. Near as the techs could figure, the darkness wasn't dangerous itself. It just limited EM to a ten foot radius somehow.

Yeah, we were classic tough guys back then. We didn't give a damn about the darkness. It was the unknown source that kept us up that first night while we camped near that godforsaken place the source, or whatever might have lurked inside

Still, we talked ourselves into it. The whole macho military thing, you know. The brigadier general had a plan. We were going to set up a web of men, lights, and radio relays, each within ten feet of each other. It sounded like it might work.

It was cold in there - damn cold, compared to the desert heat we'd grown accustomed to suffering. Turns out, it's hard to heat a place that gets no sunlight, no infrared, and no radiation of any kind. It was only convection and conduction along air and sand that kept it barely survivable.

I was behind maybe two hundred guys when I finally walked into the Ink, with three thousand more coming in after me. The lights and relays worked, and kept it lit and loud, but there was still a perfectly dark sphere around each bulb. I couldn't see the next light until I was within ten feet of it - that's why we'd set them up eight feet apart.

It was eerie as hell seeing spheres of safety blink into existence as I approached across the sand and eerier still to look back and see men and equipment I'd left behind vanish into nothingness. We'd step out a few feet, begin setting up gear, and pray the rest of the world didn't somehow leave us behind in the few tense seconds before the radio came online. You ever heard a radio with no static? No ambient background noise? There's none of that crackle you expect, by instinct. It was just this keening silence. I remember staring at my radio with a sensation that I was falling into endless blackness, an absolute lack of sound and infinite noiseless echo that somehow still seemed to have some latent awareness behind it -

I remember thinking that there was every chance that men were dying all around, being snatched into darkness, being shot by rebels that had stumbled across us, or worse but there I was, not hearing or seeing a thing. If you were more than ten feet away, you might as well have not existed.

The only assurances we had were the increasingly static-filled relayed radio rounds.

"Doran, check." I remember it.

"Rothman, check."

I raised my radio, then, happy to be heard by *anyone.* "Higgins, check."

We waited four heartbeats.

Instead of our local officer, the brigadier general's deep and harsh voice echoed over the comms. "Sorkis, check in."

We waited two more heartbeats.

He spoke again. "All mortar teams, calculate Sorkis' last location and prepare to fire on that position."

I froze. What?

Given a direct order, two men in my light bubble did not freeze. Opening a few crates, they unpacked the mortar and checked their map and angles.

A blast of static hit the radios. "I'm here, Christ Almighty, my radio just went out for -" He cut back out.

I sighed with relief, and the two men relaxed and began decommissioning the mortar.

The next order immediately chilled us to the bone - far deeper than the ghastly cold of that place. "All mortar teams - share telemetry data from that last transmission, and shell Sorkis' current location as soon as possible."

I remember staring at my radio again, this time for a far different reason. That had clearly been Sorkis' voice. Who did the brigadier general think that had been? If it wasn't really him, what could possibly have faked his voice so quickly? Did the rebels have some sort of new tech? Or had he been under duress? What did the brigadier general know that we didn't?

That gruff voice came again. "Sorkis, if you're out there, I suggest you move. If anyone encounters Sorkis, bring him out of the darkness zone as a potential enemy combatant. Do not touch him or allow him to speak." A heartbeat of silence followed as he let those orders sink in. "Continue the check-ins."

I remember exchanging looks with the other guys. Smart tactics, or paranoia? It was too soon to know. We sure as hell weren't going to be late on our check-ins.

It was basically the most horrifying place imaginable. No other way to say it - and it was becoming increasingly clear that we weren't being told the truth about the situation.

For hours, I stuck close to each light, moving forward ten feet at a time with my squad. I had my gun up and ready, pointed at blank nothing. Lord help any lost soldier that stumbled into our little bubble - there was no way in hell I'd have time to check what I was firing at, and there was no way in hell I'd have the focus to hold off, in any case. It was freezing out there, as we crept along the sandy bottom of a pitch black ocean, but I was sweating the whole time.

Among the constant chatter of static-filled checkins, random nervous comments began making the rounds. The lieutenants made no move to stop us - Christ, if a guy couldn't crack a joke about inching forward through an otherworldly zone of darkness, how could anyone keep it together? Those tense mutterings turned to conversation, and then speculation.

The first grimly quiet true observation cut through all of that. "I think I heard something growling."

That immediately brought back all of my tension, and I held my gun higher. I imagined many were doing the same. Out there in the darkness, there was a line of men and women advancing across the desert, but we couldn't see or hear each other. It occurred to many at the same time, I think, but Thompson Cristina was the first to speak with authority.

She muttered some sort of profanity, and then told us: "Your light only extends ten feet from its source - but if you're standing closer to the termination radius than the bulb, something that doesn't need light to see could be standing just beyond *watching you without being seen.*"

A series of chaotic orders erupted on the radio, but the brigadier general's calm fury cut through all of that. "Every man on the front line - prepare to shine your personal flashlight forward on my order. If you see anything whatsoever, open fire." He cut back in quickly. "Make sure you're pointing the right direction."

I waited, shivering from cold and terror, acutely aware of the growing weight of my gun. The men behind me backed up, moving closer to the light and drawing their weapons as well. We'd all felt watched for the last several hours, and muttered comments to each other about it. If there was something lurking right out there, if something *had been right out there the entire time,* Lord I was going to unload every bullet I had into it.

It was probably only the span of a few seconds, but it felt like an endless purgatory. I couldn't look away, couldn't drop my hands, couldn't wipe the sweat from my forehead. What was happening out there? Had he given the order? Had our radio gone out? If our radio had gone out had something happened to the men behind us? If the links had been broken what if we could never find our way back? Nobody was saying it, but that darkness had to have been supernatural, right? Which meant we were far and away out of our league. We'd been trained to fight human enemies, to hunt down terrorists and clear out rebels. This was just -

"Mark."

I clicked my flashlight on without even thinking about it.

I was so hyped up on adrenaline that I actually imagined I could see the flashlight's beam waving out, billowing back the darkness in a cylinder slightly longer than the main bubble.

It was only by weeks of ingrained training that my finger stopped with the trigger halfway depressed.

Another soldier stood opposite, facing me, weapon drawn - flashlight out - with another team of scared men behind him, gathered around a main light.

Had we gotten turned around? Had we somehow messed up our positions? Or did the darkness mess up navigation somehow? Or -

I narrowed my eyes. I shouldn't have been able to see that far. How was the ten foot sight limit being broken?

I looked closer. The uniforms were all the same but so were the faces.

*It was a reflection.*

And as I stared, I saw a slight turbulence in that reflection, little imperfections 

Movement.

It was something huge something gigantic and *mirrored.* The best sense I could get of it was that it was some sort of reflective enormous snake, slithering by in the sand everything in me screamed at my fingers, begging me to pull the trigger, but some small part of me asked: what could my gun do against something so huge? Humans would fall if penetrated by bullets, but this thing this thing would only lash out in rage, if it really was a living creature.

I stepped back.

The other men hadn't seen it. They'd been just a foot or two behind me. Good, they wouldn't know to fire except everyone else on the front line might -

God forgive me, I ran. I didn't have time to think or plan or call out or make a transmission. I just ran.

I saw the other guys look at me as I bolted past, and I could only hope that they understood.

The light behind me blinked away, and the light ahead of me blinked into existence. Tense soldiers stood guard, startled by my approach, but they lowered their weapons as they saw me.

They, too, turned their heads in confusion and watched me as I bolted past.

The darkness may have stopped EM, but it didn't stop reverberations through the sand. I felt the first impact like it was one of these damn earthquakes. I had one chance to react, and, spurred by a sudden mental image I had of what was happening, I instinctively chose to jump.

Something enormous hit me from behind, crushing my backpack into me, and I tumbled up in the air, over a slippery surface, and back down to the sand. The protective spheres of light were all gone, and I had nothing but my flashlight. I saw nothing in a brief scan around me but bloodied sand and shattered equipment and I had a broken arm for sure.

I ditched my pack and forced my way to my feet on pure adrenaline. There was no radio, no light, no help - nothing. I'd been terrified of that very situation all night and all day, and it had actually happened. Which way? *Which way?* It was black just black that darkness haunts my nightmares still. Which way would *you* choose? There was something enormous out there, something snake-like, or tentacled, and mirrored, for some goddamn reason. What was the point of mirrored skin in absolute darkness? *It didn't make sense!*

But all I could do was run. Pick a direction, and pray. Would God hear me in such a place? Were prayers subject to the same ten foot limits?

One direction held some sort of horrific creature that had just devastated our front line.

One direction held my brigade and the brigadier general that had ordered us into this nightmare on a lie.

One direction held the unknown, and miles of darkness.

I prayed for the third.

I stumbled through the sand for hours, days how could I know? I had some water left, but drank it all. I stopped to tie up my broken arm after I was reasonably certain I wasn't about to be instantly killed by giant lashing mirrored flesh. All I could do was walk

And, yeah, it occurred to me that the darkness might never end. All my macho tough guy shit was snuffed out of me by a single experience and I would have cried, if I could have spared the water. I just wanted to see someone, anyone any human at all the Sun!

Except I came out at night time. I almost didn't realize I'd escaped. It was still pitch black, and ice cold, as it gets in the desert. I wandered so long that I became delirious and then I woke up with some rebels.

They'd taken care of me, given me water and a place to sleep until I healed. That still doesn't make sense to me

But I was out. I guess God had actually heard me in there.

Worst part, though? The nightmares since. Not born of that mirrored monstrosity, but of the sounds I heard walking through the dark zone while lost. Growling a roar and screeching like that goddamn sound we hear sometimes, the squealing truck sound. The hell was out there? I'll never know. They hounded me the entire trek, held off only by random shots from my gun.

And they left mocking gifts for me every few hours - limbs, mostly, from my squadmates. That's the thing - *they knew which men I'd been with.* These weren't just animals.

*They knew.*

And they got off on torturing me. What kind of mind would do that, Thompson?

God...

---

"So what happened after?" I asked, mortified.

He just laughed dismissively. "I went AWOL, jackass. Why do you think I'm here, like this? I wasn't about to die in that icy hellhole."

"And that's why you're still alive," I realized aloud.

"You actually believed the cover story?" he said, laughing again, this time with a hint of derisive madness. "There's someone you should talk to, over at Teskoy Prison."

"Who?" I demanded, gripping him by his ragged collar again. "Is Cristina alive, too?"

"Oh no," he replied slowly, visible moisture welling up in his eyes. "I shoulda figured that's what you were about. Vasiliev killed her. That's why he's in Teskoy."

Any hopes I'd had were dashed completely. It was all I could do to fight down blind rage. "Blaku? Vasiliev Blaku?" I remembered him from my battalion I remembered him as a prankster, a fool, and a clown. He was the youngest I knew in the service at the time. It didn't make sense. "*Why?*"

"I ran into Doran a couple years back. He said Blaku led a mutiny. Tried to kill the Double-Edged Sword himself."

My anger drained away at hearing that. I didn't know who that nickname referred to, but I did know her "Cristina tried to do the right thing and stop him." I let go of his collar.

He sighed unhappily. "Yeah. She was a good person. The best, even." Looking up at the golden midnight sky, he shook his head. "If Blaku had actually pulled it off, we might not be here now."

"What do you mean?"

He stared at me. "Haven't you been watching?"

I shook my head. "I don't watch TV. Propaganda and rot."

"It's the Trial of the Decade," he replied, still not believing I hadn't seen anything about it. He looked up, behind me, at a giant television billboard that had survived the latest earthquake when everything else in the poor sections of the city had fallen. "It's everywhere," he breathed. "The brigadier general - the Sword - we came to call him the Double-Edged Sword behind closed doors, because of his increasingly brutal tactics. Eventually, he went too far. He's the one who started all this. He's the one who brought the Crushing Fist down upon us."

My nerves jangled with uneven fire as I absorbed what he was saying. *That* was the Trial? Putting the brigadier general on trial for somehow bringing the Crushing Fist upon us?

Every news network - hell, every channel - and every overheard conversation - kids making action figures of the oncoming storm, TV soap operas using the end of everything as a plot point, science fiction novels running through various explanations and scenarios that their protagonists always eventually overcame, rich people having parties in mockery of their fear - and I'd almost been there, right at the very beginning of it all, if if I hadn't left

But how could I have stayed? Not after what happened

I didn't have anything else to say to Higgins. Instead, I gave him a five dollar bill - all I could spare - and apologized for my roughness. I left him there, in the aft-streets, and he just walked slowly off the other way, almost immediately getting lost in the dirty and diseased crowd. I remember looking back as he passed by a mound of rubble and thinking: I'm never going to see this man again.

But I did wish him luck, silently. We'd been squadmates, once. My time in the military seemed like a long-ago separate life, but I couldn't wish him ill for trying to survive, even if it meant I hadn't learned the truth until now.

Doran, Blaku, and Higgins are all still alive even though we were told they'd died. What the hell really happened? Our brigade commander is on trial for causing all this, and a cover-up is claiming that everyone we knew died in the sand out there

That's why I'm emailing you guys. I need to know what happened to Cristina, and to the rest of the men and women we knew. I can't investigate anymore myself, because Ethan came through.

When I got home, a letter was waiting for me. I've been reinstated, and they're sending me out tomorrow.

It's suspiciously fast, but it might be a chance to get out there and ask more questions.

And I need someone to go to Teskoy as a favor to me. I have no intention of going up there to ask Vasiliev any questions myself. I need to know what happened, but if I see that bastard in person I know I won't be able to stop myself. I'll strangle him with my bare hands.
