	<TEXT> This is literally a Copy/Paste of an Asshole Celeb response I gave a few weeks ago:

I managed a movie theater in Calabasas, CA (a haven for wealthy celebs just outside Los Angeles)... During that time I met nearly every A-List Actor/Director/Producer in Hollywood. Most were very decent people, but I have two stories about unnecessarily mean celebrity assholes:
Gary Sinese--Lieutenant Dan from Forest Gump--was watching a film and got so upset about a volume issue that he stormed into the lobby, charged the concession stand, got in the face of one of my teenaged concession girls and started shouting at her. She burst into tears immediately. I lost my shit for a split second... I rushed over and physically shoved him back and stepped between them. He started to get loud with me and I shouted--"HEY!"--at the top of my lungs, which gets the attention of EVERYBODY in the lobby. I then dressed him down like the bitch he is... I explained that my concession girls didn't get paid to be shouted at--that's what I was there for. Gary's not a very big fella. He calmed the hell down REAL quick, which is good, because seeing my cashier crying got me hot enough to fight. He apologized to me after the show, but I blew him off and told him to find HER and say sorry--which he never did. Dick.
Jessica Simpson was at the concession stand getting snacks with her then husband Nick Lachey before their movie... An utterly adorable little girl (maybe 7 to 9 years old max) very politely approached them, waited for a contientious moment and then sweetly asked if she could "pretty please take a picture" with her. I guess Jessica was not happy with her outfit, because she turns to Nick and says, "I don't knooooow..."--then without ever directly acknowledging the girl--just walked the fuck away, leaving her better half to apologize to the girl and carry all the snacks himself. Cunt.
BONUS STORY: I was driving toward Sony Studios on Culver Blvd and was getting into the turn lane to make a Left on Overland... Out of nowhere this car flies all the way from the far right lane--across 3 lanes of moving traffic--into my lane and swipes my car. The driver is a cute female, but I didn't care--I was pissed. We exchange info. Yadda yadda... I report it to my insurance. That night I get a call from Cute Driver (on a private number which I answered despite knowing better) and--HER SISTER. They proceed to let me know what an asshole I was for reporting the accident and then threatened to make up their own bullshit claim on me--and then fucking laugh and hang up. Well... Cute Driver must have forgotten that I snapped a cell phone pic of her Driver's License, Face, and Car/License Plate... The cute driver was ANNALYNNE MCCORD from the 90210 TV remake. BITCH! Luckily the story does not end there...
So... I am very pissed at this point. I realize that she gave me her cell number, which I use to look up her address online. And unfortunately for her--OOPS!!--my buddy is an Editor on TMZ. I published everything I had on her (phone, address, DL pic, Car/plate pic, etc) to my FaceBook and Twitter feeds and then sold my story to TMZ. Turns out the scuff Mark she left on my car rubbed off with a wet rag, so along with the $2000+ insurance check (which went right I to the bank), I actually netted over $3000 and have a pretty good story to share. Win! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Takashi Miike's DEAD OR ALIVE (1999) -- http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_or_Alive_(film) -- Fans of Miike will enjoy for certain... But it is a fairly standard Yakuza/Tride plot/story with some stylized direction--right up until the last few minutes where things get very fucking surreal. SPOILER ALERT... The two main adversaries finally face off, but after riddling each other with bullets, they each refuse to die--and force themselves back to their feet. At this point, the Cop reaches behind his back and pulls out a massive rocket launcher... The Gangster reaches inside his own chest and pulls out the glowing orb that is his heart... The Cop fires the rocket... The Gangster baseball pitches his glow-ball-heart... The rocket and glow-heart collide--

I would also remove William Hurt completely or make him emote with CG technology. What a worthless piece of shit actor.

Other than that--great flick. A definite visual influence on The Matrix. Watch it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well--Damn.

I haven't checked Reddit in a couple days and this post got some upvotes.

Okay... To try and provide some further detail...

My girlfriend and I are getting an apartment together. The new complex we are moving into accidentally cashed our deposit checks a day early and as a result, the checking account linked to my debit card was overdrawn by a few dollars. I do not use credit under any circumstances. Never. So I have no other cards beside my debit card. And I happened to not be carrying any cash on me.

Backstory--my work team meets at this particular coffee shop once a week for a meeting. I have interacted with this Barista many times. We are not friends--but he knows I'm a regular who always buys something.

As it happens, the majority of my team beat me to the meeting and were sitting down when I arrived. They watched me walk up to the counter, place my order and swipe my card. And I could tell at least one of them was curious about where my usual drink was, because they asked me if the Barista was "brewing a fresh pot"? Which I just kind of affirmed without saying yes.

Shortly thereafter he walked over with my usual drink and handed it to me while apologizing for the wait. It played perfectly. In fact, I almost felt rude for not being more appreciative right then--but he caught me off guard. I was not expecting a random act of kindness.

On my way out that morning... I made sure I made eye contact with him and held my empty cup in the air and gave him a big head nod and smile.

The next day (pay day)... I went back over and ordered the same drink I always do. He actually didn't ring me up, but I spotted him, walked over and gave him a $20 and said "good lookin out yesterday". He tried to refuse the tip but I persisted and he went ahead and took it. I felt great.

**EDIT:** I forgot how cynical Reddit is. I didn't take any pictures to prove anything because I just don't think like that. You'll just have to take my word for it. But it was an awesome experience and I'm glad I got to share it here. Thanks for the upvotes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fucking PUNISHER: WAR ZONE.

This movie is so fucking ridiculous--it's awesome! In the first five minutes, Frank Castle  decapitates an old man, stabs his wife in the head, breaks a guys arm so the bone is sticking out and then STABS THE GUY IN THE HEART with his own arm-bone, kicks a chair leg into a guys eye socket, does a flying-spinning headbutt and hangs upside down from a chandelier and shoots like 100 fucking people.

That is just the opening scene. It gets more ridiculous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't really comment on reddit logic... Is there such a thing? Sounds like an oxymoron. I just like funny stuff.

Having said that--I think he did the right thing.

History is full of examples of "Rule Breakers" that ultimately end up justified in their actions. I can't believe I'm going to do this, but I am... The entire American Revolution was an act of rebellion. They broke many laws. We wouldn't even be redditing right now if they hadn't done it. So for whatever it's worth, I'm glad that the spying was exposed. Even if a guy had to break his contract to get it done.

P.S. A licky Boom Boom Down. </TEXT>

Thank my parents. They both read a lot. And somewhere along the line they picked up the novel of JAWS.

When I asked my Dad if I should read it he said--"No". Told me he quit half way through and never finished. I read it anyway. Mistake. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess that's why I'm calling BS.

It's not that it isn't explored more... Based on the Director's intended presentation of the film, the dark aspect is not explored at all.

I didn't really think about it until tonight... I thought this film sucked--maybe that's why I'm so quick to hate on it. </TEXT>

JAWS

The book is fucking horrible. I'll put it this way... There's a subplot about the Mayor on Amity owing money to the mafia--which is why the beach must stay open. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly... It sounds like Duncan Jones might be full of shit.

He made the movie--with that ending. And realized later what he had actually done, and is now trying to 'revise' history by claiming he intended the moral ambiguity.

Just a thought. Filmmakers do this stuff all the time. </TEXT>
