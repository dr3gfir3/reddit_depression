	<TEXT> It happened with the slightest touch.     
We were friends for a long time, and I never realised I was in love with him until, one day when we were at a bar, he, put his arm around my waist and pulled me closer - out of the way of a passing, flailing drunk.     
It was that one touch that did it for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done this before. Not in public, because I know it's kind of unpleasant (I go to the bathroom to do so). But I have done it at home, even if my man is with me. I do so because it's better to have that one blast of yuck as opposed to constantly sniffing mucous during your / their meal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know about men vs women statistics, but I can attest that people who played sports as kids tend to better at teamwork, tend to be more motivated and focused, and tend to be more health conscious as adults. I wish I had played more as a youth, it might have helped me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'm not going to have children in the first place. That sure as hell messed my parents' lives up.     
    
That said, if I ever was burdened with the care of small dependents, I would be sure to:    
    
* have them take up a sport (and not be allowed to quit easily)    
* make sure they are reading something    
* make sure they are educated (as opposed to just being told "not to do something because I said so.")      
    
As you can tell, my parents were bad at explaining, let us kids run wild without taking responsibility for anything, and in the case of my poor, poor little sister, never had us read anything. (My sister, bless her heart, is practically illiterate. I was a bookworm by choice.) But they did their best, so I can't really complain too much. We do the best we can with what we are given. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Orifices in general are harbours for bacteria and should be kept especially clean. Belly buttons, noses, ears and mouth should always be tidy as possible. Remember, though, that they are orifices, and can be damaged from the outside as well. Be gentle. </TEXT>

There are things you can tell a best friend that you couldn't tell a boss or a family member. Sometimes it's more reasonable to lie than to cause a shitstorm with the truth.  </TEXT>
