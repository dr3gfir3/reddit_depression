	<TEXT> Hey everyone! Don't know how often this comes up. Apologies if it's well-worn ground. 

Headed down in June from Toronto to see the city, and as someone who has only dealt with the concrete colossus that is the Skydome, look forward to seeing a proper ballpark.

Just wondering if there are any legitimate alternatives to stubhub (which I disagree with on principle, but use in a pinch). Just want to grab some bleacher seats and enjoy the day.  </TEXT>

Been on my shelf for some time. Going in a little blind, but I have to say I like the writing style. Just kind of carries me along.

**Darwinia - Robert Charles Wilson**

I read Spin last year, and liked it. The pacing was a little slow, but it paid off. This one seems to have similar themes, and hopefully it slowly chugs to a great conclusion as well, if not a little faster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think I've ever screwed up the nerve to comment here. Most discussions I catch are a bit over my head/specific, but opinions? Opinions I got.

For the record, I tried not to read your descriptions of the songs, since I hadn't heard two, to try and be unbiased.

**Limousine** - One thing I find makes a song epic, is choral vocals. The beginning is haunting, and makes me feel, maybe 'worried' is the best word. Unsettled. That's where my head goes when I hear a group singing like that. My example would be [Iron Maiden - Fear of the Dark (Live)](https://youtu.be/epYKVcHrVr0). Don't know if we count live songs, but that crowd give me goosebumps everywhere, everytime. Another trait they share is that slow build, erupting (at about 2:00 in both) into something much more chaotic.

**The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly** - I can't listen to this song without closing my eyes and seeing massive deserts and lone gunmen. Listen again to the choral vocals (are they called something different with no lyrics?) driving the song to it's conclusion. I guess it gives me a sense of...distance, and urgency. Gets the heart a-thumpin'. I can picture myself, hurrying across the plains on horseback, and it is very vivid. I get a similar feeling with [Rush - By-Tor and the Snow Dog](https://youtu.be/2UU62UcP_BA). That sense of seeing yourself in the Netherworld watching demons and monsters battle. I guess another aspect of an epic song is if it can transport you somewhere, physically (not literally, Lana).

**tken** - Was not expecting throat-singing today! Very cool. I think it exemplifies that same layering of sounds and echoing that makes a song give me chills. Another aspect, I think, is the foreign (to me) language. Take [Sigur Ros - Hoppipola](https://youtu.be/mZTb8WxEW78). The slow, playful opening, building to crescendo, and dropping off at the end. I almost feel, almost unfulfilled, to be honest. And I have NO idea what's going on. Maybe, then, the mystery and unknown of words you can't comprehend adds to the 'epic' value? IMHO, I could have picked any of their music to make this point.

**TL;DR** - Music that gives a sense of the unknown, or mystery. Songs that transport you, metaphysically, to another place. Whether specified by the song or not. And finally, a language barrier can enhance the idea of the unknown.

My two cents.

	<TEXT> I feel like every event I go to in Toronto, or hear about secondhand, is run the same way. Admission, plus you pay for everything. The sample sizes even sound like they are smaller than usual this time. These things must make the lion's share of their profit by cramming in as many people as possible, customer experience and beer supply be damned. I've abstained from the last few summer beer festivals out of frustration, even though I found the interaction was still there, simply due to the cost. Lately, we just try and keep an eye out for actually brewery events.

On a lighter note, we spent Saturday evening at the Only for their Ottawa Tap Takeover. Sure there was less information (the staff were actually at a loss for a lot of the beers that were only on for the night), but at least the beers were available and priced better. Some great stuff was had. I think Dominion City's Earl Grey Marmalade Saison was my favourite of the night. </TEXT>

Here's the thing: I've never made ribs in the slow cooker, and I might never. Steamed in the oven for a few hours, and they're as tender as any place I've had them. Mostly because I like to put the sauce on just at the end, then broil/grill. Also, my s/o prefers them basically dry, but there's no accounting for taste :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds pretty good, with an emphasis on the animals comfort, not on viewing and interaction. Only in the last year or two have I started learning the difference between good and bad ecotourism, besides the obvious. There have been a few places I have seen with the disclaimer "If the animals don't feel like hanging out, sorry...", and I think that is very important.

Was at a rescue/sanctuary zoo in Queensland with free roaming emu, kangaroos, peacocks and what-have-you. But they made sure that it was clear on entering there were no guarantees any animal, including the koalas and monkeys, would be having a "friendly" day. Lot of kids having a cry because they didn't get to hold a koala/monkey that day. </TEXT>

I saw a director's roundtable with him and he basically says the cost has a lot to do with it. Something about the increasing prices, how it used to be entertainment for the masses because everyone could afford it. I think his insistence on old-school methods is just nostalgia.

	<TEXT> I don't think that's necessary. Also, for clarity, I didn't mean portable toilets. You see it more with washroom trailers, and whenever the plumbers finish em on every third floor or so. 

Also, upon further reading of this whole thread, the Australian job site seems much different than the Canadian one. With 11 years in my union trade, some of the stuff in this thread (improper safety, overt sexism, hazing) is shocking to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My opinion, as a male worker, is that they *should* have separate bathrooms. Not talking about portable toilets, but trailers/finished washrooms. How terrible would it be to have to sit in a stall next to some twat who's making comments under his breath at you all day? Would there be less when they know you can't tell who it is?

	<TEXT> /u/dirty_rez already mentioned Cyprus Lake camping, which is excellent, and the Grotto is a little surreal.

I'd like to add our favourite trip last year was to Flowerpot Island, just off the coast near Tobermory. In a nutshell: A ferry drops you off on the island, and you can mil about with the daytrippers on the rocky beach, or on the trails. The best part is, after all the tourists leave, you are alone on the island overnight! (With anyone else camping). This gives you a great opportunity to visit the Flowerpots with no one else around before the first boats come, as well as the caves and old lighthouse site on the north side of the island.

Whether this is right for your family is up to you. Depends if you are just looking for car camping. There are only 6 campsites, no power, no water, no fires. You purify/filter water from the bay. Honestly, the campsites are such a short walk from the usual boat drop off, carrying  lot of stuff isn't difficult. However, we did have to walk to the north side (30-40min) for pick up, due to inclement weather.

All in all, a very unique experience, which we intend to repeat. Might be nice for a night or two, if you are in the area. But book in advance, mostly due to there only being 6 sites.

Any questions, feel free to ask, or check the [website](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/amnc-nmca/on/fathomfive/activ/activ8.aspx) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't have as many problems with *Eight* as I do with other Tarantino movies. I felt overall it had better characters than *Basterds*, and less cheesy moments and better dialogue than *Django*. Probably one of my favourites by him. 

The problem with spelling out the characters' backgrounds would be ruining the mystery. Even Mannix (personal favourite) was left murky, until the right moment. I swear I was waiting until that last moment with Daisy for him to say "I ain't really the sheriff".

The other problem with having eight full on flashbacks would be the pacing. Honestly, I wish there wasn't even the flashback to the gang first arriving at Minnie's! (Let's not talk about the unnecessary narration) All those other tense speeches, one more with Channing Tatum spelling out his murderous plot would have been fine, I'm sure.

I welcome your criticisms of my criticism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But there was no mystery in Kill Bill. Everything was laid out. If you had got a backstory for each gang member, it would either be false, and necessitate another flashback later, or be true, and ruin the mystery. Either the pacing or the plot would suffer.

And, in my opinion, there *is* no relevant backstory to these characters. They're guns for hire in a gang, getting paid to free Daisy.

	<TEXT> Had a very similar problem in NYC a couple years ago. Stayed at a lower-cost hotel, got in late and didn't check anything, just crashed. Started early walking about the next day, none of the bites were noticeable. Turns out my lower legs and back were covered, much like the girl at the end. Jammed into hot boots for 8 hours, my feet swelled up like balloons. After politely explaining to the hotel that we would be paying nothing, we left, cutting our vacation short. Now we are very, very careful staying anywhere, but the feeling of unease never goes away. </TEXT>
