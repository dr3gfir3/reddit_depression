And the idiotic Daily Mirror literally refers to her as Princess Leia:

	<TEXT> The newspaper business is a lot like the TV news business in terms of local affiliates. Like there's the USA Today Network, whose article was used in a few of those, sometimes with a different headline, and then there's the Metro newspaper network, which even exists in Brazil, and you can see that the cover with the Star Wars typeface was used in 9 different local papers. Then there's the Associated Press, which has articles syndicated through hundreds of news outlets in print and online, but again, the headlines are often changed by the different publishers.

Consider that someone had to decide and approve what main story to put on the front page (and the editors of other papers chose otherwise)...whoever it was *had* to be thinking that way...

"The Bass guitar player [Dee Murray] is really driving this song; busy, but very tasteful Bass work." 

Also see the 1980 Central Park concert that is surely one of the greatest rock concerts ever recorded (same bass player too!;) -

	<TEXT> This is how serious he was about working out when he started:

 Even on the weekends when the gyms were closed, he was back, wiling to break and enter to get his work out. He says that; "It would make me sick to miss a workout...I knew I couldnt look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I couldnt do it."

http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=146525523

His friends actually helped create a makeshift gym for him out of cinder blocks and metal rods.
And he's much the same today:

"My day cannot start without doing something physically," he told the magazine. "And I work out at night before bed  cardio, weight-training. I want to stay in shape as long as I can."

https://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/5jxeqs/arnold_schwarzenegger_admits_he_struggles_with/

He said in another interview that he and his brother had to do jumping jacks and push-ups every morning to *earn* their breakfast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aside from seconding the advice of others here who say to take a new and more open view of your physical self, I do want to point out the rather shocking rate of cosmetic surgery in the world today, as reported in the charts at the link below; you'll see that nearly 100,000 American women had breast lifts (mastopexy) in 2015. A quick google search shows that it costs [around USD $6,000](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2 ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8 q=mastopexy%20cost oq=mastopexy%20cost rlz=1C1CHMO_enUS568US569 aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l5.2325j0j9) (CAD $8,100, 4.700, 5.700, or AUD $8.300). But again, I say: Save the money and the trouble and try considering the appreciative and enthusiastic perspective that your boyfriend has! Exercise to feel good, primarily, and secondarily, to like how your body looks more, overall!

 The most striking trend today is not competition, it's consolidation.

 The internet takes away with one hand what it gives with the other. Now that it is so easy to acquire information and consult with everybody (including suppliers and customers), organisations frequently dither endlessly.

	<TEXT> Exactly, it's for promotion, I think Ronda's hubris has gotten the best of her. She's talked so much trash before, but now pulls her arm away from Rogan and quickly walks off the stage like a big baby. We saw in her foolish pride in her fight against Holly Holm and I expect we'll be seeing it again. I would think she wants conclude her career on a high note, as the defeat last year was one of the biggest sports AND regular news moments in the country. Her aspirations to be a tough nitty-gritty movie star (with at least one superhero role) depends a lot on her having had a legacy as a great, WINNING fighter. If she were to win the upcoming fight, it would be hailed as a great comeback story, after a whole year of suspense. But I think Nunes will humiliate her. As McGregor has said "There were times when I won the contest, but lost the fight." In light of that, there is secondary importance to her also not being broken, bloodied up, and made to look awkward or weak in the course of the fight.

	<TEXT> That seems to be true; she refused to say a single word or even remain on stage right after their staredown (link below). I thought that was very immature and cowardly and already a bad sign. I'd say that she is scared and knows she may lose again, or at least face more hits and more injury than she did with any opponent before Holly Holm.

	<TEXT> Part of the way that the WWF/WWE made pro wrestling a national primetime-TV sensation in the mid 1980s, and then a global one, was because of the use of a much more highly developed storylines, which created more highly developed characters and an air of suspense and drama that engaged audiences (or engaged them far more) than would be the case if the matches were just presented as just "John Smith vs. Jim Smith! Please enjoy the display of the strength, skill, and technique!" The UFC has definitely taken a cue from that very effective way to promote the fights, with the interviews and press conferences before and after the fights. The UFC and WWE organizations are, after all, called "promotions." 

And in all actuality, many, if not most, competitive athletes (in America, anyway) actually do "talk trash" in real-life conversations about their ability and their chances of winning and being a lasting champion. Being wishy-washy or indifferent about winning, and being deferential towards one's opponents, are not conducive to a winning performance. As a lifelong sports fan, I've watched hundreds of athletes give tough-talking, boastful answers to questions. And speaking of vendettas, there are actually whole Wikipedia articles devotes to various pro-sports rivalries - here are some of the martial arts ones

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_rivalries#Martial_arts

Perhaps most notably, Michael Jordan's Hall of Fame enshrinement speech consists of a whole litany of F- You's to those discouraged, doubted, challenged, or played against him. The mainstream media's idiotic reaction was one of self-righteous dismay, saying it was so unfortunate that he is such a "bitter" person who needed to "settle scores." I guess they don't understand the point of a score*board* itself.

There are some very prominent examples of posthumous renown in the world of literature; Emily Dickinson's poems have been published and republished, now hundreds of websites, and have been read by millions of people, and have even been required homework reading for hundreds of thousands of students over the past 130 years, yet she had online published a few in her lifetime, and they were heavily altered by editors.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson

Meanwhile, the young French poet Arthur Rimbaud burned unpublished manuscripts of his work before he abandoned writing poetry altogether: 

 After [parting with Verlaine, Rimbaud] returned home to complete the work and published A Season in Hell. However, when his reputation was marred because of his actions with Verlaine, he received negative reviews and was snubbed by Parisian art and literary circles. In anger, Rimbaud burned his manuscripts and likely never wrote poetry again.

Reddit is a private company that can do whatever it chooses, as decided by those who own and operate the site. In all seriousness, who could or would possibly file a lawsuit about the banning of a subreddit? The site Voat cropped up in the wake of many subreddits being banned (and Voat itself has banned some as well), and I just checked and can't find any evidence of a lawsuit over a subreddit deletion.

	<TEXT> The PRIME VIDEOTAPED EXAMPLE of that from this current situation would be Scott Foval boasting emphatically and in proud detail about his history and reputation as a career political criminal. There's that one moment where he says something "You're prrrrobably familiar with my work... *[and then nodding]* Yes, that was me." He obviously thinks he's some sort of genius artist, an *auteur* of deliberately provoked anarchy. As Trump told Hillary, she should be ashamed of herself, and it's great that WE are getting these people at least nominally ashamed enough to delete their profiles! For example:

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/593ktz/scott_foval_has_deleted_his_twitter_account/

Then, of course, there are the THOUSANDS of such written instances in the leaked emails. There are three aspects of it: the statements themselves, and then the very act of making a physical (digital) record of it, and then the conveying it, often to more than one recipient! It's funny how even the lowest-level drug dealers are more careful (or you could say paranoid) about how they conduct their transactions and communication! Like whispering, looking around, and going "Shhhh..." 

Even the average guy hawking cigarettes outside a city deli is more discreet--do you think he'd exchange emails or text messages, let alone in literal terms about his business?! But these people are just all out there with it amongst themselves, and now the WikiFLOOD reveals hundreds of individuals involved in it, from the political system AND from all different industries!  </TEXT>

I think that all the leakers think that the US public's memory span is only like a day-and-a-half long...and maybe they're right. After all, look at how relentlessly Hillary keeps trying to remind everyone of things that Trump has said. She seems to think that there are lots of McCain supporters out there in the country, even though even at his most popular, he managed to get only 173 electoral votes, while Obama got 365.
