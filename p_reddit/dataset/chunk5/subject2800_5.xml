	<TEXT> In his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump has actively worked to dismantle the institutional safeguards built into the modern presidency. He has restructured the National Security Council to sideline knowledgeable participants in policy debates who might challenge his impulses and those of his inner circle. He has ignored the interagency process in writing executive orders, leading to political firestorm and bureaucratic chaos. He has attacked the administrative independence of civil servants. He has done all of this in the name of addressing a supposed condition of American carnage of rampant crime, illegal immigration, terrorism, and unemployment. As many have noted, these crises are almost entirely fabricated. In the real world, the crime rate has decreased in recent years; there are fewer undocumented immigrants now than a decade ago; the travel ban does not address an actual terrorist threat; and the nations unemployment rate is at historic lows. </TEXT>

To accomplish this they need to create a narrative that Obamacare failed, and therefore it isn't the fault of the current government.

	<TEXT> According to the Committee to Project Journalists, 36 journalists have been murdered in Russia since 1992, 23 since Putin first became president in 2000. Most famously Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in 2006 while investigating torture in Chechnya. The subject has arisen before in connection with Trumps view of the Russian president. In December 2015, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough told Trump: He kills journalists that dont agree with him. Trump answered: Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I can tell, the EO's don't actually do what the headlines say they will do, in most cases. In this case the EO doesn't remove Dodd-Frank, it starts looking at the issue. Ditto for his EO that was reported in some circles as removing Obamacare, in reality it did nothing. So no, he can't just unilaterally remove laws, but he can spew forth Executive Orders to tell the government to start looking into removing laws and count on the media to report it as if he was legislating solo. </TEXT>
