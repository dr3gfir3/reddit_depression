I completely agree with you, the whole workflow of maschine makes a very unique sound and process to putting together patterns. I'm in love with it its really helped me progress. Honestly everytime I open maschine its something different. I'm still experimenting I only started a year ago haha. I really appreciate this comment man, I'm saving it for next time I'm in a slump haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I purchased a used maschine about a year ago second hand and had a hard time getting it installed because some of the software was already activated on the guys dad's account. The guy who sold it to me gave me the login info for the account and I got it all running and activated on my account somehow. I recently got a new laptop when I went to activate it it wouldn't let me. I called naive instruments and they told me it was activated on the other guys account. Now when I try and log into the other guys account the password has changed. The guy isnt answering his phone (he could have a new number) and I have never got an answer from the email on the other account (tried emailing it when I first purchased). Now I am stuck with a maschine mk2 and no software. Does anyone have a serial I could buy off them? Is there any other way to get maschine software running? This really sucks. If I buy a komplete keyboard will it come with maschine?  </TEXT>
