	<TEXT> They do testing for Down's by Amniocentesis. It carries an approximately 1 in 200 risk of miscarriage and it isn't used unless they have a reason to suspect the baby is abnormal. Usually something shows up on sonogram. But sometimes Down's syndrome kids are healthy aside from the Down's so the typical things that show up as warning signs such as heart defects aren't there. Women start feeling a connection to a baby very early. To abort after 15 or 20 weeks would be devastating to most, and considering the advances in medicine, and hopefully society in general, there is no reason why a baby with Down's syndrome can't lead a healthy, fulfilling life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a seventeen year old that I had when I was nineteen. We've offered him a glass of champagne on New Year's, no go. He's had a steady girlfriend for two years and we don't tell him not to have sex, we tell him to not be irresponsible like me and his father were (we're still together :)) and put a condom on of he's going to have sex. Luckily we are the perfect examples! He just got back from his Senior's trip to Paris and France, so he really had the opportunity to grow. He just got his license and we bought him a cheap car with the understanding that he pays for his own gas. And he always has to tell us where he's going (which I feel is common courtesy). We don't shy away from subjects, we face them head on. He was caught watching porn at age fourteen and instead of freaking out we told him that he needed to be more careful because he has a brother six years younger. It's about balance and honesty. They are going to do bad shit. It's better that they learn moderation and responsibility early. </TEXT>

He said I needed to get help or he didn't know if he could stay. And he was ABSOLUTELY right. I know his actions may get criticized but it made me realize that my depression didn't only affect me but him and our children, too. If she won't get help you REALLY need to think about your own well being. Your number one priority should be yourself, and it honestly sounds like you have done all you can for her short of physically dragging her to the doctor. It's not fair for you to have to keep suffering at the hands of someone who refuses to help herself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People don't realize that treating HIV now is akin to diabetes. Not cureable, totally manageable and people rarely die from it anymore because the anti-retrovirals have come SO far. Literally from handfuls of meds that gave you a few years to a one pill a day regiment that adds decades to life AND significantly improves your quality of life. It also seems a lot of people ASSUME that HIV is only contracted by unprotected sexual contact, but in reality there are people who did not lead high risk lifestyles that have contracted it. Honestly, someone who is forthright about there HIV status from the being is giving you something you don't get on first dates often, COMPLETE HONESTY. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just going to put it out there that I'm Canadian. Our school system, while it has it's faults, embraces differences and encourages all facets of learning. I have an 11 year old with "behavioral" issues who is treated as a valuable member of his class. My 17 year old loves his teachers and they have gone out of their way to help him on several occasions. I don't find schools authoritarian at all. There are rules that are put in place for protection of the kids, and I have not seen any of the ridiculous rules enforced here like they American news reports. My kids can bring butter knives to school for their lunch and can bring medication without a drug arrest. A consensual hug is not sexual assault here. So when I say our children are our future it's because here they ARE. And the good ones far out weight the bad ones who think "Reality TV" is reality.  </TEXT>

My point is that people who argue strongly against the LGBT lifestyle, as we've seen with countless politicians, are actually rejecting something within themselves. They are rejecting a part of themselves they have been taught to loathe. The may or may not be the case, but as I stated it is my opinion and the feeling that I get from this story. I have survived a molestation myself, so believe it or not. I'm trying to be supportive and find arguing semantics over the wording of supportive post rather tedious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of COURSE there is. The two are not related, but some people vilify LGBT as "perverts", which  is COMPLETELY wrong. I think her mom "doth protest too much". A female who molests a female must in part identify as Bi or lesbian, not to say all LGBT would molest someone, but rather that this woman did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The more you talk about this, the stronger your voice becomes. Your MOM did this, and groomed you to believe it was normal. She despises LGBT because she identifies with them, much to her dismay and she apologizes for rapists because she is one. She forces you to keep quiet by labeling all molested children as liars. She is completely insane. Your feelings and experiences are valid and she will do anything to invalidate you. Stay strong, talk, heal. For you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My bestfriend split from her husband about 7 months ago. Her and her husband were very miserable together. They have young children. She always thought that because they never fought in front of the children that even though they were miserable for years, the kids would never be the wiser. It wasn't until her 7 year old realized (from me and my husband) that mommies and daddies kiss and hug each other and asked my friend why her and her Daddy never kissed, that she realized she had robbed her kids of seeing a healthy relationship between two people. Staying together "for the kids" is so much more damaging than you could ever imagine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those women are STILL not representative of all women. I care very much about my husband's feelings. It kills me if I hurt his feelings. I have two sons, as well and I couldn't ever hurt them either. Believe it or not, I feel men have true, valid feelings capable of being hurt and that, yes, some women are insensitive bitches, like this woman. Everything is about her. That isn't right. She SERIOUSLY needs to grow the fuck up. </TEXT>
