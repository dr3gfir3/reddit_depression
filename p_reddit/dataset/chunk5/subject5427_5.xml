	<TEXT> There is no doubt that Janus is the best Mage in the game when played correctly. He isn't the highest damaging, he doesn't have the best set up and he isn't the best for survivability but he has a fairly decent level of all 3. Master Janus and you can wreck everyone. Not to mention his amazing global ult for fast rotations and returning to lane.    

Use you portal as an escape and to help team mates escape, as well as using it to engage and setup.

Use your ult to quickly recall after winning a team fight and get all your team to fire giant / gold fury in seconds.

And never forget your slow ( the line on the floor I forget the name) also increase your magical damage by up to 60% this is awesome for turning around a boxing match. </TEXT>

   What is wards were free in social games? I think it would make more people pick them up and in turn learn how valuable they are when they come to play league. What do you think?

	<TEXT> 1. Buy and use as many wards as possible.

Although there are some places better than others to use your wards, having some is better than having none at all. Try using them in the jungle so you have sight of potential ganks and buff/XP/objective camps. (I know this sounds quite obvious but I play so many game where we loose because the only 2 wards on the map are mine)

2. Keep a good eye on the jungle camp and objective timers.

The mid XP camps and gold fury are an opportunity to get small xp and gold leads on your opponents. If you can clear these camp efficiently you will soon notice your xp and gold lead increase massively. 

3. choosing when to recall or leave your lane.

Try never to leave your lane when your opponent is still there, this will give them easy farming and structure damage. (I know there are circumstances when it is more beneficial to leave lane but this is just baisics)

4. Know when  to rotate and team fight.

Team fights at gold fury and fire giant are so important to win as you can easily secure the objective. If you see a team fight here try to get there, it is better to lose a bit of farm in your lane and secure an objective. 



I know there are circumstances where these are impractical or less beneficial but these are just some basic pointers. Please let me know of any other little tips you have or if you disagree with mine, I'm no pro I just want to share my tips. </TEXT>
