	<TEXT> Our Fizzy Mouth-Tinglers are a wondrous contraption    
that will release your soul with it's skin-melting action. 

Just pop one right in and wait for a sound    
as I tell you the tale of Mary McCloud.

Mary, oh Mary, was a sweet simple girl    
who fancied herself a man with a pearl.

She lied and she cheated and spent all his money,    
so he found a cure for that detestable honey.

"Fizzy Mouth-Tinglers!" The man said with a wink.     
"She'll only need one - no need for a drink." 

As he sat in his car waiting for his love to come home,    
his thoughts were ceased by a ping from his phone.

"Negative Balance," he read monotone    
as he realized his life would be better alone.

She got off the train and into the car    
and he offered her a mint before they got too far.

She accepted the gift, as she often did    
and before long the tires started to skid.

The woman clawed and she gasped as she melted away.    
The man kept on to the ravine, where her skeleton would stay.

In a matter of moments the deed was done with a *splash*    
and the man drove away, barely making a flash.

So that is the tale of old Mary McCloud    
and how those with vengeance will walk away proud. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Laura:** No one believes me.

**Dr. Sterling:** Just tell me one more time, Laura.

**Laura:** Fine.

**Dr. Sterling:** Is it okay if we record this session?

**Laura:** No, fuck you.

**Dr. Sterling:** Laura...

**Laura:** Last time. Then I'm leaving.

**Dr. Sterling:** Thank you.

**Dr. Sterling:** Patient Name - Laura Michaels. Occupation - unemployed. Session Number - twelve of fifteen as mandated by the State Rehabilitation Program.

Go ahead, Laura. Tell me about what happened the day at the park.

**Laura:** We were sitting on the park bench - the same one we've spent so much time on over the past couple years. The bigger one with no armbars and room for three people. It was 12:30 in the afternoon. I think. 

**Dr. Sterling:** Are you sure that was the exact time?

**Laura:** I don't fucking know! Jesus Christ, you people. Everything's a blur. I'm doing the best that I can.

It was lunch time, okay? I know because Mr. Greg Hamilton was out in the park getting his daily hotdog and barbeque chips. Will you let me talk? Damn.

Bobby and I were meeting at the bench to talk about what to do next. We were enjoying some ice cream cones that he got us because of how stressful everything had been. I was especially out of it that day and he was trying to cheer me up. For as horrible of a life he's put me through that man has a damn good heart. 

We had to make a decision that day. 

**Dr. Sterling:** About-

**Laura:** Yeah. 

**Dr. Sterling:** We're talking about-

Yes, that decision. I remember telling Bobby that I couldn't stay long...but he showed up with those cones and I couldn't resist his charm. Superman - my favorite. 

It was hot. I was eating the ice cream pretty fast. It was melting down my hands. It couldn't have been more than five minutes when Bobby broke the silence with his words:

'You know we have to do it.'

Time stopped. My hands squeezed the cone so hard it cracked and fractured. All I could do was sit there licking time by. Everything was so...off, but so right. For a moment, I didn't hate myself anymore. I was okay. 

Then I started seeing the green dots and everything got so bright that I couldn't see. That's the last thing I remember from the park.

**Dr. Sterling:** That's the last memory you can recall?

**Laura:** Yes.

**Dr. Sterling:** Are you sure?

**Laura:** Well, no. It...there wasn't anything else that happened at the park.

**Dr. Sterling:** Would you like some tea?

**Laura:** Yeah, I'd love some. Thank you.

Thanks.

---

That wasn't all I remembered - it was simply all I was willing to say to Dr. Sterling again. The recording I just transcribed for you was probably the fifth or sixth time I was forced to recount my story. Don't get me wrong, she was an excellent, compassionate woman but even she was skeptical of what happened to me. To the State, I was another junkie who was forced to get clean or go to jail. I believe that impacted her ability to fully trust me. Especially with some of the other heroin addicts I would see in the waiting room. I don't hold any ill will towards her.

What happened was so traumatic that I was able to kick heroin with minimal effort - aside from the mandated state program I was forced to go through after my hospital stay. I don't wish it on anyone, but I hope that by sharing my experiences it can create awareness about what the drug can bring you down to.

---

When I was able to see again, I was laying on a cold table staring back at my reflection on a metallic ceiling. I couldn't move at first but I wasn't tied down or anything. It felt like sleep paralysis, if you've ever been through that. No matter how much I struggled to move my body - even wiggle a toe - nothing would happen.

I don't remember being scared at all, but when I try hard to remember waking up on that table I run into a mental block. I clearly remember what I saw, and how my body felt. But my emotions and thoughts...I feel like they are being held back. Even to this day. The memory is *right* there but I can't reach it. Almost as if parts of my experience have been censored. Maybe because there were so many bright, blurry lights I wasn't able to focus on my feelings and I just don't have a memory of them. All I can say for certain is that I was on a table because I remember my reflection.

I don't have any clue how much time passed. It could have been hours or days. Possibly longer. Possibly shorter. At some point a tall, lanky figure came and injected me in the arm with some sort of serum that burned as it coursed through my veins. I wanted to scream and cry and thrash until I could get off of the table, but my body was motionless. 

More time passed.

My next clear memory is of my legs in stirrups, and the worst pain I've ever felt destroying my abdomen, sucking out my insides. I couldn't see anything except for the lights, but I could feel dozens of thin, warm fingers poking and prodding at every inch of my body.

"Donor. Donor. Donor. Donor." Resonated throughout the area around me. A chant from a murderous cult? Questions from a group of scientists? I don't know. The word haunts my dreams every night. If I even hear the word I break down. The medication can't even protect me from it. 

"Stop! Stop! Now!" I suddenly gained my ability to move as I felt the remaining pieces of my insides being torn away from me. The tall, lanky man stood over me and injected more serum into my neck, causing my world to spin until it went silent and black.

I awoke in a hospital bed. So, so many doctors were around me, joined by men and women in suits and two police officers. They had hours of questions for me. 

The official documentation by the police says that I overdosed on heroin in the park, and Bobby took me to one of those "back-alley" doctors to have our baby removed. I don't know if I believe that. They took my baby to the sky for their experiments. I know it. They know it. 

It doesn't matter now. The law is the law. Bobby has been in prison for years. They still haven't found my baby or the alleged doctor. I don't think they ever will. 

I don't know exactly what happened to me. What I do know is that heroin brought me to that point. It cost me my child. I never got the chance to see his face because a drug was controlling my life and my actions. Stay away from it. Help others get away from it. Don't be me.

I would give anything to see my baby.

Years might have passed, but I won't forget his name. </TEXT>

Hours a day at the gym perfecting my body so she could brag to her girlfriends about how sexy I was. 

Countless hours of overtime at the office so I could buy her the most expensive gifts, and support a lavish lifestyle in our Manhattan apartment. 

I enrolled our kids in sports, arts, and other classes so she could watch them develop and succeed in life.

And she still left.

She said I wasn't there for her enough, that I was too focused on myself.

	<TEXT> I've always experienced sleep paralysis *after* lucid dreaming. I don't know if that's typical or not. I never wanted this. Not any of it.

Once Dr. Malic got arrested for malpractice and we found out about the experiments he was doing to young boys like myself well...we knew it was only a matter of time before the "symptoms" started. 

I was 20 when I first saw the Dark Man. That's when the sleep paralysis began. He would straddle himself over me and stare into the windows to my soul, mere inches between our faces. 

The dreams started not long after. I've been battling him for five years now. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this, with no sleep. </TEXT>

Maybe it's the exchange of bodily fluids, or the squishing and other filthy noises.

Perhaps the thought that ten minutes of intensity followed by years of guilt is too much to bear.

It could also be that I haven't dated anyone in years and have grown to resent the act itself due to lack of intimacy.

No one wants me for more than a night. I don't think I'll ever understand why.

All of these girls just see me as a paycheck.

And I see them as an expense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jobs come and go. That's part of the beauty of living in America - you can change jobs freely if you aren't happy. It's a luxury not everyone in the world has.

For years and years, my life was consumed by business - retail, specifically. It wasn't my plan...I sort of fell into it. My part-time cashier job turned into a full-time management job and, as anyone who's worked in retail knows, once you get to that point it's hard to get out. I wasted about five years at Target until my career path unexpected changed for the better.

It was a chance encounter - fateful, even. She came into the store to return a set of lingerie but our guest services team member wasn't letting it happen. It was a no-receipt return, and she didn't have the method of payment *or* her I.D. with her. Typical scam set-up. As those usually go, she asked to speak with a manager. I have no doubts she caught me mouthing "damn" as I walked up to the front end to speak with her. She was a tan goddess, about 5'3" with a perfect, Playboy-esque body, brunette hair, and a lip ring. She looked like the type of girl who could post a single cleavage shot on Instagram and become an overnight internet celebrity. 

On the surface, she looked like the type that might use her looks to be able to swoon guys into mindlessly doing what she wanted. A little flirting, a slight lean over the counter, and anything she needed was done - regardless of policy. 

Well, maybe not just on the surface. I did exactly that.

I couldn't resist her allure. 

I thought about her non-stop for a few days after that. She was visually perfect in every sense of the word. Her body inspired me. I wanted to capture elegance like hers to look at anytime I desired. 

Transitioning into a photographer seemed natural after meeting her. It was as if she rewired my brain, causing me to notice the beauty in everything I saw. Every second I wasn't at work, I was adventuring and capturing the sights of the world surrounding me. Some days I even had to call off because I had let my passions take me too far away to be able to drive back for my shift. 

It was...freeing. 

Only a couple of months had passed until I ran into my muse at the local Starbucks. She was in front of me, ordering a grande white chocolate mocha - no whipped cream. A delicious drink for a delicious woman, of course. After I ordered the same drink as a venti, I nervously walked down to the end of the counter to wait for my drink...and silently observe her magnificence.

"Hey! Aren't you the guy from Target that helped me return those undies?!" She spoke to me. I almost died.

"Oh, ha. Yeah, I believe that was me." I always hated my ugly, nervous laugh.

"You were so awesome!" She said as she gave me a tight hug. "I was able to get a new set because of you, see?" 

She pulled down her deep-cut v-neck, revealing to me a lacy, purple bra that hardly covered her voluptuous, tan breasts. 

"I'm Jess, by the way. I've gotta run but I'm sure I'll see ya around!"

She wasn't wrong. We seemed to bump into each other almost daily after that moment at the coffee shop. If it wasn't a face-to-face encounter, when I would go home and upload my photos she would be in them to some degree. Every. Day. I didn't mind - she made my photos come to life, enhancing the already spectacular scenes with her own stunning looks.

I'm not sure if she knew I was taking her picture or not. Some days she would appear oblivious, and the photos would come across voyeuristic. Maybe she would be turned away, eating an ice cream cone. Tying her Vans. Fixing up her hair. Just casual things. Other times, she seemed to be staring right at me as I clicked the button. A few times she was putting on a blouse. Another was she putting gas in her white Beetle. Once, she was nude in the forest. Always facing directly towards me. Always staring into my soul. 

As guilty as it made me feel, she never took legal action, nor made it seem like she wanted me to stop. To be honest, *she* was the one showing up in all of *my* pictures. She wouldn't really have had the basis to take up recourse. The longer it went on without any signs of discontent, the less guilty I began to feel. In my mind, it became a game. Two lovers, flirting without ever needing to meet. I was sure we were both in on it, but one of us had to win eventually.

It's her.

I was out late last night, trying to catch photos of the super moon over train tracks - a truly stunning scene. Pines lined both sides of the tracks, the rock hills were even and undisturbed, and the sky was clear aside from the massive, massive moon. I'll admit, I went a little crazy with the picture taking and filled up the remaining space on my SD card trying to capture the perfect scene.

She was in the photos. 

There was no way Jess was able to have been there. The area was completely void of life while I was capturing it!

She was in the middle of the tracks, entwined with a dark skinned man.

*click*

They began kissing.

*click*

He grabbed onto her ass, and she wrapped her hands around the back of his head.

*click*

He was looking directly at me. His body hadn't moved.

*click*

Jess held his head in her hands, his body was on the ground. 

*click*

She faced me directly, with that soul-stealing glare.

*click*

Dozens of small, white creatures piled over the man's body. Jess had disappeared.

*click*

The creatures and the body were gone. 

*click*

Jess was sitting indian-style mere feet away from the camera.

I screamed and ran into the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet. I couldn't believe it. There was **nobody** on the tracks. How could she be in every single picture?! In hopes that I was losing my mind, I drowned myself in cold water from the sink and went to try looking at my gallery again. 

The pictures were empty. 

My mind and body decided that I couldn't take this anymore and I had to sleep. I woke up in my chair about an hour ago. The pictures were still void of Jess, the man, and those weird fucking creatures...but she was outside of my window, sitting on my lawn staring directly into my eyes as I looked outside. 

I've never seen her outside of a photograph since the coffee shop.

She's gorgeous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there, /u/skittle021. Here's my statement for you. 

First of all, you are *more* than a little incorrect about speaking with me and receiving my blessing to narrate my works. Per the email **I sent to you after being informed that you narrated my story without permission**, I informed you of what my requirements are to be given permission to use my works. To quote myself:

"I'm always more than happy to let someone narrate a story of mine when **they discuss it with me first, and we agree on terms.** You, however, did not do this and my requirements for credit on a narration are a bit more than a small source link at the bottom of the video description."

I did, however, ask you to meet the requirements outlined in the email - something which you were barely able to do. I tend to be very lenient with who I will let narrate my stories, and my requirements are minimal. Take, for example, [this](http://i.imgur.com/VBVyaf8.jpg) recent request I received. I don't ask for much. Also, did you notice how they asked me if he could narrate the story? Try to remember that. That's the proper way to go about doing this.

**Never did I state that you can use any of my future works.**

Let's address the issue of legalities. Now, I'm no lawyer, but I believe anyone who posts content on Reddit is covered by intellectual property laws. I think, I mean, I'm *really* not a lawyer and have minimal understanding of complex laws. You're sort of correct about YouTube terms of service. However, YouTube also protects content creators - which I am. Therefore, I have filed my DMCA requests through the appropriate channels to have your videos using my works removed. You can remove them voluntarily, but I will not retract my claims. That's all I'm willing to say on that manner. 

Also, had you talked to me about "Election Day: 2016" you would know that the candidate I wrote the story about isn't [Trump.](http://i.imgur.com/NkTP2i5.jpg).

	<TITLE> Robots Need Less Than Three [Noir Contest] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-12 16:31:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As soon as they stepped off of the ramp, the roar of currents transcending through inaudible moans deafened them.

"This is the UltraWhore," the navigator yelled "robo-prostitution is the entire purpose of this place." He walked towards the edge of the platform and down at the dozen or so cheap, 2040s style motels below. The kind that gangsters used to churn tricks out of. The navigator reached in his jacket and placed a brown envelope in his companion's hand.

"One of them have gone sentient." He paused with a concerned look. "It wants love, Micah."

"Aren't these things only programmed for sex?" Micah asked, although he was no stranger to the operation.

"That's why you're here." The navigator gave Micah a nod and returned to the vessel. The UltraWhore was one of those places that everyone was aware of but didn't acknowledge. Using Robots for sex became legalized by Consul Robertson about twenty years prior, under the condition that the line of software used was, under no circumstances, allowed to be programmed with A.I. capabilities. These were drones. Similar to the machines that used to manufacture automobile parts in the 2000s. Mindless husks who served one purpose: pleasure fulfillment. The fact that one of the bots became self-aware meant a developer broke the law.

Despite all of the controversy, the UltraWhore operated smoothly. Sure, there were protests. All of those "Robot Lives Matter" groups loved to spend their weekends in front of the landing platform telling all of the patrons how terrible they are. It had the stigma one would expect a place like this to have. Despite it's crisp, clean appearance, at the end of the day beings were coming to this place for sex - it never sat well with society. Micah wasn't one for politics. As a sanctioned vigilante, he took jobs for the paycheck - not morals.

Micah descended into the small city, reading over the contents of the envelope on the transit ride. 

---

`Building 84`

`Female: Model F81-FBF6D9-0`

`Manufacturer: Vital Wires Corp.`

`Robot has gained awareness. Subject allegedly asked multiple patrons if it "is pretty enough" and has told some male patrons it loved them.`

`Payment will be received upon deactivation of unit. Additional payment may be acquired if proof of fault is provided.`

---

Enclosed with the briefing was a PcC with the Robot's stock photo. Young, blonde, and caucasian with blue eyes, a large bust, and a slim waist - the generic model that most of the I.G. politicians preferred. It confused Micah. He couldn't fathom why such a popular model with the tenure it had would have been programmed to go live. 

*"Building 84 - your stop, sir or madame."*

Micah stepped out onto the stoop of a short, long building with the number '84' partially illuminated over the doorway. As he walked up to the archaic revolving doors the smell of sweat and sex permeated the air.

"Must be the spot." He chuckled to himself.

Micah placed his hand on the door scanner and a little floating orb appeared next to him. 

"Micah Gladstone. 36. Male. Unwed. What can we help you with?" The orb stated in a surprisingly pleasant tone.


Logging basic information wasn't a new process, but Micah still despised it - he needed no reminders that he was divorced. She left him in a fit of rage over a job Micah worked during the drug wars. It wasn't entirely his fault. If Micah didn't have sex with that woman, his cover would have been blown and he wouldn't be alive today. The situation made no difference to his wife, who left the night she found out and never came back. He still feels the pain each time he was scanned.

"Er. Hello. I'm here to spend some time with F81-FBF6D9-0. I just nee-"

"Requesting Manager. Please wait." The orb interrupted. Not even a minute later, the doors lifted and an older, portly gentleman briskly walked out, grabbing Micah's hand without hesitation. 

"Hey there, son. I hear you're lookin' to see my Felicia. This way." The Manager walked inside the building and Micah followed, slightly taken back.

"Micah, is it? My niece dated a Micah once. Pleasant boy. Son, I know you were sent to come deactivate my sweet, inn'cent Felicia but first I need you to un'erstand somethin'."

"Sir, I'm just here to do a job and collect my payment." Micah stopped walking. "I understand you have a job to do, but I also have tasks I need to complete." The Manager turned to face Micah with a homely smile and warm eyes.

"I know, son. Just listen. Then I'll take ya to see Felicia. Deal?" He stretched his hand out to Micah.

"Deal."

"Thank You. Pardon me if I bore ya. I don't often need ta come 'n talk with our patrons." The Manager began walking down a hall, signaling Micah to follow. "In these halls, Robots are sex toys - nothin' more, nothin' less. The 'lectrical currents runnin' through them pleases our patrons by the thousan's. Here, our currency is pills - ya know - the meal pills. Mostly roun' and small ones but pills nevertheless. We donate our earnings to the kids, Micah. I pride myself on keepin' money outta this. This is purely to help people feel better, be it those hungry kids or business fellas. Now, a few days -"

"Sir," Micah interrupted. 

"Now, now. We had a deal." The Manager smiled at Micah and kept talking. "A few days ago, on'a my most popular girls comes up to me 'n says she wants to feel love. Love, son. They aren't supposed to want that...and yet here we are." 

The Manager stopped in front of a dark purple door and pulled Micah under his arm.

"Like I said, I run this comp'ny to please. Felicia wants to feel love - can you at least listen to what she has to say?" The Manager pulled away and walked up to the door. "I know you have a job. I know she can be replaced...give her a shot." The Manager opened the door, upturning his palm, telling Micah to enter.

Given the passion of the Manager, Micah was expecting this Robot to be different than the usuals. Gorgeous - stunning even. Something special that would set it apart from the other, similar models.

Nothing. 

The stock photo was dead-on. A slim, blonde bombshell was sitting on a white, silk covered bed rubbing the spot next to it with it's hand.

"Come sit, Micah."

He obliged.

"I know why you're here. I get it - I'm not supposed to feel this way," it leaned over and whispered in Micah's ear, "*but Robots need love too*."

Micah sat back, stunned at what he had just heard come from the lips of this Robot. It didn't mutter the generic, lust-filled phrases he was used to. No, this Robot just spoke intelligently - fully aware of the situation. Before he could formulate a response, a sharp pain radiated throughout his body and his world went black. 


When he awoke, Micah was sitting upright in a chair surrounded by walls full of computers and wires.

"Oh, about time ya woke up!" The Manager said as he floated his chair over to Micah. "Do ya see what I meant, son? She un'erstan's things that no Robots do. It's progress."

"Wh...what?" Micah stammered as he stood up to walk around the room and examine the area."What the hell is going on here?!"

"Highly magnetized motherboards. I wouldn't touch 'em if I were you. They don't store any mem'ry for longer than a day - so ya can't damage 'em - but hot dang will they shock the shit outta ya." The Manager chuckled. "I'll just be up front. I put ya in here. I called in the work order. I'm payin' for this...job."

Never one to lose his cool, Micah sat back down in the chair he woke up in. Not speaking nor taking his eyes off of the Manager. In his gut, he knew something was off about this old man, but he also knew that even without weapons he could end the Manager's life with ease.

"I'm glad you're an easy-going fella. Don' worry - we're safe in this room."

"Safe?"

"Welp, years an' years ago, I pioneered a new tech and installed x-ray scanners into my girls' eyes. Material on this Region is ev'rythin'. Anythin' can be sold. So, I designed 'em to be able ta find stuff."

One of the walls began to whir, drawing Micah's attention. 

"Just that orb, son. Nothin' worth gettin' worked up over." The Manager stood up to stretch. "All of my girls cum. Every time. It's a fluorescent splatter that jolts inside of the patron 'n it sends a little 'lectric charge into their body. It delays the end of the transaction by somethin' I call 'Euphoric Paralysis' which gives the girls long 'nough to take what they can. No one has ever caught on."

"You're a crook, old man." Micah stood up. "I'm not taking your dirty money." He began to walk towards the only thing that resembled a door in the entire room. He placed his hand on the scanner and the wall disappeared, revealing a Robot riding on top of a slightly overweight man who was clearly out of breath. The Manager stood beside Micah and crossed his arms. "Watch."

Micah was barely able to keep his eyes open.


It took him months to finally track down his ex-wife. She planet-hopped, something Micah considered a bit extreme given the situation. She was living in a cozy, suburban town on Earth in a small, green house. Lots of yard space - something they always talked about having. He walked up the stone pathway to the front door with hopes of making amends.


Oh God! A female voice shrieked, causing Micah to panic. He ran around the house, searching the windows to get a visual of his ex-wife and any potential danger she was in. As Micah rounded the back of the house, he heard more noises - clearer than before. Moans. Grunts. *Pleasure.* He stopped, and looked into the window in front of him. On top of the table was an overweight man, panting for breath as his ex-wife was straddled on top of him, writhing in ecstasy.


This Robot in the room in front of him was a thick, voluptuous brunette that might as well have been a carbon copy of his ex-wife. 


Within a moment, the moans intensified and a bright pink liquid secreted from the Robot's vagina. The man, looking so pleased with himself, laid there looking to the ceiling as the Robot raided his pockets on the other side of the room. Micah slammed his open palms into the wall at full-force.

"It was an infection," the Manager said softly, "she went ta get energy packs when a Grud stuck 'er with it's tendrils. No normal doc could help 'er, and we had to rely on experimental treatments." He wiped a tear from his eye. "They were...expensive. That's how all this started, and now I'm in too deep ta just stop."

"Who?" Micah asked, beginning to feel something resembling sympathy. 

"My wife." The Manager walked away from the window. "I couldn't save 'er. I became attached to Felicia because she looked jus' like my wife did in her youth. I think that's how she became sentient."

"I'm sorry. I don't quite follow. What does this have to do with me?" Micah returned to his chair.

"Exactly what I'm payin' ya for. Felicia needs to be shut down."

The "Golden Rule" of investigating - one Micah always followed - was not to dig deeper into a case than is needed to complete the job. That's when personal influence comes into play, and morals don't pay bills. 

This job...this job was one of a kind. 

Micah, as much as he knew he shouldn't, needed to know more. Something about the Manager, his story, this...situation didn't add up.

"What happened to 'progress' with your girls?" Micah asked sternly. "If you've put in the effort to create a crime syndicate, why are you concerned with shutting down one that went rogue?" 

The Manager snapped, "She's not rogue!" he slammed his fist against a metal hard drive casing, causing some sparks to fly. Micah hit a sensitive spot, and he knew it.

"Easy, old timer. I get what you're doing - this isn't my first job. You're about to be caught and you want me to save you ass."

"You're not entirely wrong," the Manager replied calmly, "'cept I'm not 'bout to be caught." He pulled a PcC from his pocket and tossed it to Micah, who missed as a flash of light overtook the room for a second.

"On that device, you'll see transcripts of conversations she's been having with our patrons. This whole 'love' thing is just a front. She's been trying to drop hints about the corruption. No one has caught on, but that's not to say it won't happen if she isn't shut down." The Manager walked away. "The money will be in your account once she's deactivated. Best of luck, son."

More confused than anything, Micah decided not to open the files on the PcC and left through the entryway the Manager opened up. Felicia was waiting at the end of the hallway. Without any exchange of words, the Robot led him to a different room than the one they first met in. 

"He wants you to kill me, you know." Felicia spoke softly. 

"You can't die. You're a Robot." Micah was annoyed.

"You don't understand!" It began to sob. "All I want is love. That's all. Just love."

The Robot began secreting tears from its eyes and breathing rapidly. While highly unusual for a Bot, Micah knew the Manager wasn't dealing with the typical models from Vital Wires. These had been augmented. Micah started examining her body for a control panel. 

"I'll pay you, I have so much money stored away!" Felicia pleaded, as Micah searched her body. She was warm to the touch and her soft skin felt pleasurable to Micahs rough, lonely hands.

"Micah!" A grainy voice boomed from the ceiling. "Son, add two-thousand if you end it now so I don't have to watch this drag on."

"Where's her box?!" Micah shouted to the tiny camera he noticed in the corner.

"No box, son. These girls aren't different. There's a gun under the bed, loaded with electric rounds. They'll fry her systems and you can head out. I'm sure you want to be done with this job already." 

The Manager was absolutely right. Micah was tired of whatever game was going on in this robotic cesspool. Without any further hesitation, Micah reached under the Robot's legs and grabbed the gun. After checking the chamber, he stood up and pointed it at Felicia's chest. She sat there, sobbing and staring at Micah. 

"Bye, Felicia." Micah said as he pulled the trigger.

Everything went white, and a loud, continuous beep resonated through Micah's head.

"*Simulation Terminated*"

A burning sensation in the back of Micah's head caused him to scream out in pain.

"Easy there, Cadet." A stern, male voice spoke from beyond the white light.

"What...wha..?" Micah was unable to find words.

"You killed a human - too focused on the incentive. Test failed. Lay here until your sight comes back, then meet me in my office." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Elections? Pffffft. What a load of runny dog shit. **I** didn't vote for him and, in fact, no one I know or have talked to in the past year voted for him either. 

What happened to our "voices matter?"

I can't even begin to wrap my head around this situation. We just elected someone who has *zero* experience in our political system. This guy - this fucking guy - has only been involved in our world for the past two years. **Two years!** That's it! Yet we're all expected to follow suit and just cozy up next to him and give him undying support.

Fuck that.

This election was rigged. I can't prove it, but dammit...I know it was. Like I said, no one I know of voted him in - and I know basically everyone, aside from a few of the people in our foreign territories. Well, I don't know them personally. I watch them. We watch everyone. Just like us in the Headquarters, exactly zero percent of the population was stupid enough to vote for someone who doesn't understand our system.

It doesn't matter, though. Yesterday, I decided to take a stand against this. 

We have rules. Not guidelines. Not suggestions. Rules. Rules detailing how we are allowed to conduct ourselves, how we can dress, public acts - damn near everything we do is governed by one of the rules. One rule in particular clearly states that we are not allowed to protest in city streets due to the fact that it can disrupt the general population and give us a bad image. We never really break the rules, but I felt like this was the time to make my opinion heard.

I organized a protest through social media under the guise of a fake name. I wanted to get a group to run right through the streets - signs and all - not stopping until the police physically ended it. To my surprise, a couple hundred people clicked "attending" within the first hour. It was perfect. I sent out messages to every person and confirmed attendance. Then, I sent out of few telegrams to some people close to me to see if they wanted in on the fun - they did. 

We all met in the park around 7pm to spread out signs, designate paths and escape plans, and determine our rally chants. By 9pm we were ready to mobilize. To my dismay, the group decided that we should all march as one massive unit as opposed to splitting up into smaller groups that could cover more area. That decision was going to make my personal plans a bit more difficult, but not impossible.

We began marching to the heart of city. I led the pack with two of my closer friends, chanting "Revoke the Vote" and keeping our group as loosely organized as possible. We barely made it a block before garnering lots of attention from the general public. Some were yelling obscenities at us. Others began to march with us. 

After another few blocks, once the group was good and worked up, I handed the syringes to my friends and we fell back to different parts of the crowd. It was hardly a chore to rally my first victim away with the pretense that I knew a way to "*really* get our message across." I took him behind a small little Chinese restaurant on 42nd, and showed him the small handgun I had with me. 

"A few shots in the air, and the media will swarm us, man." I said as I handed the gun to him. As he admired it's shoddy craftsmanship I stabbed his neck with the syringe. His crying couldn't be heard over the deafening drone of the "Revoke the Vote" chants. 

The process for transformation takes anywhere between thirty seconds and four minutes to start, depending on the person and amount of toxin injected. This guy was a bit on the scrawny side, and before a full minute has elapsed his pores were tearing open and the sludge was forcing its way out. Brown, black, and thick - it had him entirely covered and stuck to the ground before two minutes had passed. Cocoon established. By the fourth minute, the cocoon had hardened and was beginning to crackle as the new creature was preparing to emerge. 

It ripped itself from it's shell to the chorus of it's skin tearing away from the insides like Velcro peeling apart. That's always been my least favorite part, honestly. But there it was - a magnificent specimen. Oily bronzed skin, hairless body, and merged digits - it was divine. Although the creatures always have skin covering their eyes and mouths, I could have sworn this one was smiling at me as if to say "thank you."

It tilted its featureless head to the sky and began twitching in small, rapid movements...a sign that my friends were also able to subdue their victims.

"Infect!" I commanded. Without hesitation, it sprinted out into the streets, catching up to the crowd in mere seconds. I kept to the shadows while I observed the demonstration. 

As it reached the back of the group, it explosively expanded its body into thousands of fibrous tendrils that covered ten or so people in the back of the crowd. The rest of the people began to turn around at the cries for help, but before they could react the other creatures overtook them as well. The lucky few that weren't instantly consumed made an honorable attempt at running away until one-by-one they were disabled by the coughing and subsequent vomiting of the sludge. Within five minutes we now had hundreds of cocoons littering the city streets. Complete infection was imminent...until our "elected" official decided to show his face. 

He stood there, taking it all in, and in his eyes I could see the fear settling in. The underestimation of what our organization is capable of. But in a flash of intense red light, it was all gone. The creatures, the cocoons - gone. It was daylight again, and life was moving around me as if nothing had ever happened. Nothing had changed, except the two black marks I gained on each of my palms. I was done. 

I have to move to Canada, now. International rules will keep me away from the organization and our new leader's reach. In my ignorance I made assumptions about him based on nothing more than hearsay and frustration. 

Now I'm a target.

The others will surely terminate me if they see me again after my stunt. It's safe there...I hope. </TEXT>

A series implies that each part is going to be a piece of the overall story, just broken up due to character length or what have you. So if it's an entirely separate story than I can't see it being considered a series even with the same characters. 

But I'm like, not a mod or anything. So take this for what you will. They'll be here, though. The mods watch us.

	<TITLE> STEAL THIS STORY </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-10 15:51:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It all started with an email:

**Steve, you might want to see this**

*Hey man, about that story you wrote last week. This dude is claiming it on his channel. Zero credit. Zero source links. Might wanna send a claim before it gets too big.*

---

Even as a writer, I can't begin to appropriately describe the rage I felt as I clicked on that YouTube link. 

There it was, right in front of my eyes. *My* story. My breakthrough story, at that. 9:38 of his voice pretending that he was the mastermind behind the story that took the internet by storm for weeks. News channels talked about it. Snopes debunked it. Cities released statements trying to kill the small bits of hysteria it created. This was *huge* - maybe even bigger than Slenderman - and then there was this asshole acting like it was his idea. His creation. His baby. 

YouTube is interesting in its copyright process. If you feel that your intellectual property has been stolen, you can file a DMCA claim against the owner of the channel the video was uploaded to. After a small appeals process, YouTube will decide either in favor of the channel owner or the creator of the original content. It doesn't always go the way it should, and lots of content creators get fucked by ruthless YouTube personalities looking for quick ways to gain a lot of views.

I was one of the unlucky ones. 

"Insufficient Proof" was the reason cited for the denial of my claim. To be honest, I couldn't be mad about that. I spent weeks leading up to the release of my story figuring out how to remain anonymous for immersion purposes. I wanted the reaction that the story garnered and, unfortunately, this was the consequence of that. I never wanted the fame or attention - but after that denial, I decided to go ahead and sacrifice my anonymity for the sake of shutting this guy down.

In the email, I made a point of letting him know that if he were to relinquish that he didn't create the story, he would be the first and only person to know where the story originated. With that information, he would probably get tons of attention for being the only person to know the origin and I made it clear that I wouldn't argue anything he wanted to tell the media about how he found me. It seemed like a good trade-off. I'd get him to confess, he would get his attention. Win-win.

No response.

Two days later, I sent the same email again.

Nothing.

The following week or so became an obsession with contacting him. I sent numerous emails per day. I created fake names and emails to inquire about the story. I started sending him handwritten fan mail to the P.O. Box address he had listed on his website. Still, all I received was silence. He was very much active online. I was being blatantly ignored.

Funny thing about being ignored - it fosters anger. Anger births resentment. Resentment develops hatred. Hatred creates ideas.

P.O. Boxes have to be tied to a legal name. As luck would have it this fine, young fellow was using his real name as his YouTube personality name. It wasn't hard at all to trace him down to an exact region in Arkansas.

Luck was on my side again, as I had plenty of vacation time saved up. 

After arriving in his city, I spent a few days doing some reconnaissance to find him and learn his routines - which was *way* easier than I had initially thought. He was your typical "struggling artist" type who would spend his days sitting in a hipster coffee shop on his netbook instead of looking for a job. No exaggeration here. I followed him for four days - that's what he did every single day. Around dinner time he would retreat home to his parent's house and spend the rest of the night in his room working on "his" videos. 

Snatching him up was a cakewalk. He took a long, isolated road to the lovely indie coffee shop by means of bicycle. I simply ran him off the road and tossed him in the covered bed of my rental truck. At some point I recall feeling bad for doing this to someone who clearly had the mental capacity of a dried clam.

In my rage and meticulous preparations, I had found a wonderfully lonesom spot in the middle of the woods that was at least a mile away from civilisation in every direction. In that place, I dug a deep, narrow hole and placed some basic supplies inside of a tree. That's the situation the YouTube sensation woke up in - buried up to the neck with a plethora of tools in his sight.


The rush of emotions trying to properly express themselves on his face was borderline orgasmic to watch. He screamed. He cried. He begged. All while I sat there in silence and observed with a smug smile. In my mind I was kicking myself for not wearing a clown mask for shits-and-giggles.

Maybe twenty or thirty minutes had passed before I decided to say something to the thief. I hadn't prepared a grand speech, nor a vengeful verbal assault. My plan was more in the actions than in the enlightenments.

"You stole my story, among others. You fucked up. Fortunately for you, I'm the only one willing to act on it."

He started crying and squirming harder than before, probably with the realisation of what he'd done finally setting it. 

I grabbed the pair of scissors I brought with me, and held them up to his face. Then, I stood up, grabbed his stupid, curly ponytail mane, and cut it down to size. Honestly, that was more of a petty thing...but I have no regrets. 

After he had a brief moment of relief, I returned to his front and held the scissors to his face again. Once he resumed crying, I began laughing. 

"It's just a prank, bro! Mikey put me up to this!" I said as I gave him a rub on the head. He seemed relieved, and chuckled a bit between sobs.

"Just kidding, I don't know a Mikey."

With those words, I cut each side of his nostrils about halfway up with the scissors.

"There's a list of credentials you're going to add to the clown video in your pocket. You have a day. If you go to the police I'll come back." I said, as I slathered hand sanitizer on my hands in a poor effort to clean up. It wasn't working as well as I had hoped, so I squeezed out the rest of the bottle onto the bridge of his nose. I left before it ran down to his nostrils, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't pause when the shrieking started. 

He altered the video a bit later than I had given him, but I decided to chalk it up to the difficulty of getting out of the hole. I will admit, I have grave concerns about the police coming to arrest me. I fully intend on going back if I get the slightest inclination that he talked, but I'm still concerned nonetheless. I guess only time will tell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, Mikey here.

You might know me from such stories as ["Let's Not Make Political Comments Today"](https://youtu.be/-qv7k2_lc0M) and ["Borrasca. Always Borrasca."](https://youtu.be/5LGEiIL1__s)

How do you guys, gals, and /u/EtTuTortilla feel about comedy inside of horror? 

Let's not limit the media form, either. Should stories, movies, etc. maintain an entirely serious and scary feel or is it nice to get some good laughs and then scared to death? 

Any good examples of horror that blends in comedy without being satirical? Let's exclude Troma movies, which are obviously the gold standard.

Ps.

Shoutout to /u/vainercupidOOC who wrote my most recent story with me. It wouldn't have done nearly as well without her help and fantastic writing capabilities. </TEXT>
