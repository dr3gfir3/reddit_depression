	<TEXT> They sent me home. The thing is, you have to do this vertical and forward motion that involves you neck and mouth (In other words, pretend like you're going to vomit right then and there). That usually gets them to shoo me away as fast as they can.  </TEXT>

It's pretty realistic to do school during the school year and do summer internships. Most of my classmates even worked during the week and weekends during the school year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> -Get light blocking curtains (a little pricier than normal curtains but well worth the price in my opinion). 

-Don't use your phone and other electronic devices while in bed (Reddit browsing isn't going to help you sleep).

-Don't exercise an hour before bed.

-Try not to think about how stressed you are or everything on your to do list for the next day. Think relaxing thoughts, like dark chocolate covered almonds.

-OTC Melatonin has been said to work, I've never tried it myself though.

Luckily the professor woke me up. I bumped into him at a conference the next semester and he cracked himself up while telling the story to his friends. I'm glad I made memorable impression on him.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone subleasing a room or apartment from mid June - August or September? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm moving to Eugene, OR in the middle of June and am hoping to find a room or apartment to sublease before I find a long term arrangement. Are you or any of your buddies looking to rent out your space for the summer at a reasonable rate? I tried looking on Craigslist but have had no luck so far (coming from Texas, it's hard to come by and have a look at the place). 

Thanks in advance for any tips you can provide! 

Oh btw, I'm not sketchy, I promise! I'll totally respect and take care of your space.  </TEXT>
