	<TEXT> I find it amusing how intent you are on disproving Fi's usefulness. Some of us work for ourselves. My company paying for service is still me. Again, that it doesn't work for you means nothing to the overall usefulness of the service. Why the focus and intensity on arguing against a product that clearly works for many? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heh. No. When I may be in Hong Kong for 3 days, China for 2, Taiwan for 36 hours, then swing through Germany, Spain, South Africa, Israel, Jordan, Turkey and Malta within the space of two weeks the cost of the sim packs alone would pay for 10 gigs of data plus. Not to mention the ability to switch carriers at will and get around service difficulties and coverage issues when I'm here in the US. Fi ain't for everyone, but it is a wonderful and unique service for use cases where it works. That it doesn't work for you means precisely nothing as to the usefulness of the service to others. 

EDIT: Each one of those SIMs takes time to acquire, (sometimes) to initially load, to reload and recharging in many cases is not trivial and requires time dicking around  finding and picking the right recharge voucher for the SIM you have (I'm looking at you, Orange/Partner), and then screwing with portals in foreign languages figuring out how to apply it if the thing doesn't just let you apply the voucher via text. Time is also money. </TEXT>

(Obviously kidding. Activate the phone here in the US, make sure it works, step off the plane, turn the phone on, it'll pop up a page that says "Welcome to Germany. Fi works here." and you're golden.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a hell of a lot of info on the amp [here](http://www.avforums.co.za/index.php?topic=19493.00). I believe the name "ParaPix" came from there and is used to describe the amp as opposed to the entire subwoofer. The "ParaPix" amp was intended for use in this subwoofer. HTP International actually made the audio equipment and (supposedly) licensed the Paramount Pictures name for a time. 

They appear to have gone out of business in the mid '90s; their trademark shows as abandoned at that time. This [article](http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-05/business/fi-21359_1_patent-infringement) on an infringement suit against them details the likely reason behind their demise. 

In short, it's pretty much an OEMed subwoofer with the Paramount logo slapped on. The sub driver looks like an 8-10" coated paper woofer straight out of the Radio Shack catalog. If it works, just use it 'till it dies. As far as any worth, perhaps $20-30? Tons of used and new subs out there including Dayton's 12" for $135 or so that use what are likely far superior drivers.  </TEXT>

We're past the point of my knowledge on swept-wings, structural integrity, and divergence,  so I'll have to take on faith statements that structural failure would occur at speeds higher than Mach .86.

	<TEXT> **Pedant mode: ACTIVATED** 

If we're being precise; the V2 had no guns, couldn't fire bullets, and thus would be incapable of shooting itself down. Hans Mutke was the pilot of the ME-262 in question; the effects he felt were consistent with experiences at transonic speeds but were not necessarily indicative of crossing the sound barrier. Further to this point, testing by [Messerschmitt](https://books.google.com/books?id=8kX2DAAAQBAJ lpg=PA117 ots=MOmafaUuq1 dq=me-262%20.86%20dive pg=PA117#v=onepage q=me-262%20.86%20dive f=false) indicated a maximum speed of Mach .86 for the ME-262, with the airplane becoming increasingly unstable past Mach .83 and becoming uncontrollable past Mach .86. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a Business Centurion (black) AMEX. The personal cards have the oval at the center. The business cards have them on the left. Used to be called Corporate cards but was renamed somewhere back in '06 or so? Source: Had a personal and business/corporate black card. Ditched the corporate when annuals went from $1k/year to $2,500. Ditched the personal when United Airlines left the program. 

Originally ('00) the requirement was $120k spend in a year and 'good account history' with amex. I'd had a platinum since '97, didn't have great credit but had great cashflow, and was never invited but had the personal card 48 hours after asking. Got the Corporate a year later because different perks plus keeping expenses off the personal card. Annual spend requirement for that was $240k. Again, no invite but received after request. No initiation fees back then and the benefits were far better. 

Common misconception: the cards don't have a limit. They absolutely do have a limit that varies according to your use patterns (if you charge $10k/month regularly they're going to cut you off after you go up to about $12-18k depending on several factors including the nature of the charges) and the corporate/business cards have a disclosed limit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Known several people like that. One guy (who so wasn't in the special forces mold it wasn't even funny) claimed to have served with Chris Kyle and helped him negotiate book deals etc etc as well as being in the SEALS but then didn't know what BUD/S was. His girlfriend was there fawning over every word. I just politely listened and asked questions and let him spew more and more BS. Tragic.  </TEXT>
