	<TEXT> I just have to say this, and /r/politics is as good a place to do so as any. 

What the hell happened to Salon?!?

In a very liberal guy, even progressive in some of my political views. I used to read Salon in rotation with other left-leaning sites (e.g. Politico, Slate, TPM). Over the last year, however, Salon has gone from left-leaning to falling over themselves. Granted, they were always a bit shrill and overwrought. These days, though, they're just anti-Republican in such a ridiculous manner that I feel embarrassed on their behalf. Click-bait titles, opinion journalism, and sometimes straight-up manipulation of facts. 

The answer for the left isn't to try to mainstream their fringe a la Fox News. That's when false equivalency becomes real equivalency. Cut it out and just go bankrupt like other terrible news outlets, Salon! </TEXT>

Perhaps there should have been a check in place to look for differences in statement address across a single customer's accounts to catch some of this fraud. But that is a post hoc suggestion based on our knowledge of what happened. Who would even think about fraudulent accounts created in-house? We would have been focused on the account documentation process, something which would have been in order based on what I've read.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One wonders if you all could afford things if you both spent as much on discretionary purchases as she does right now? If not, that seems to be a basic inequity in the relationship which will continue to manifest itself in arguments like this. You prefer to make rare, high dollar purchases while she prefers to make more frequent, lower dollar purchases. You shouldn't be punished for how you choose to time your purchases, particularly if (as it sounds) you aren't spending as much as her. 

Despite your misgivings, I'd suggest you really consider revisiting the rule just to avoid friction. If she considers rules to be hard and fast while ignoring the underlying principle, that seems to directly conflict with your view of rules at least in this case.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know why you'd need a specific penalty for their being late. They simply get less time to take the exam, meaning that they should get a lower grade because of it. Your A students aren't the ones coming in late. Granted, I've never had 7 students come late for an exam...and I teach sections of 120. Even for the combined final, it's never more than 3 or 4. You might want to consider why they're coming late and deal with that issue instead. 

The main issue from my perspective is minimizing disruption. I save spots at the very front of the room to ensure they aren't unduly disruptive when they come in, give them the stink eye, stuff an exam in their hand and point to a chair in an irritated fashion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now there's a claim you don't hear every day, that religions and cults are the same thing. You should explain that dubious generalization rather than clearing up your example. 

Edit: At the risk of inviting more downvotes, I'd appreciate replies that are a bit less obtuse than a detailed explanation of the nuances of the definitions of the words. In today's society, cult and religion have very different connotations. To say the two are the same is essentially an indictment of religion. That a broad conception of cult can be found to fit the definition of religion is irrelevant. 

Also, I say this not as a religious person in any sense of the word. So I'm not personally offended by the comparison. I just think it's unfair.  </TEXT>

If you want to go to him to request he reconsider the grade, you need to do better than "your comments seem rushed." You mention a few bits of information to suggest that his comments have potential answers. Perhaps you can approach him and say "I'm confused by some of your comments" while pointing out those items. You may not get the grade changed, but you'll get some clarification about his comments that might better explain the grade.

	<TEXT> This is a good place to start, I agree. The thing that you also want to consider is that each throw of the die is independent, so you're going to be multiplying the probabilities of the individual die throws together to arrive at the probability of the scenario.

Consider the first scenario you mention, the probability of all odd numbers. Each die has 3 odd and 3 even numbers, so your probability of throwing an odd number is 3/6=.5. With three die, each has a probability of .5 of turning up odd. Thus, the probability of all three turning up odd is .5 * .5 * .5 = .125.

Start from the single die and work from there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't a great solution, but perhaps you can insist on all communication being in writing. This would create both distance and documentation. If this isn't possible, at least recap all discussions I writing to document who said what when. The biggest concern is that the sociopath will steal your work. Written records makes this less likely to happen. 

Also, be sure to keep discussions restricted to the project at hand. Don't discuss anything else. This will prevent you from revealing too much and making yourself expendable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While an individual job in accounting may not feel like it matters, accounting serves an essential function from a cultural and societal standpoint. It's more than just merely serving capital markets. 

At its core, accounting facilitates economic activity by serving a recordkeeping function. Audited reports largely replace the need for trust between market participants in our society, allowing people to go about their day and engage in routine economic transactions that allow for economic specialization. People don't have to worry about growing their own food, for example, because accounting reassures them that food is a available elsewhere. Food can get to supermarkets because accounting facilitates distribution systems and inventory management. Accounting also lets us plan our own economic activity as individuals through budgeting, allowing us to know for certain that we can eat today (or, worst case, that we can't).

We may not cure cancer, but we make it so that doctors can devote their time to doing so. I think that's a pretty big deal! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right. But from a statistical standpoint, both systems rely on your not running into a persistent losing streak in order to profit. However well the system may work with a small sample, you're going to run into a sufficiently long losing streak such that you fall back into the net loss area of your distribution.

Try not to judge him too harshly for ha in the same issue that many other gays have: a tendency to view their relationships in gendered ways despite being the same gender as their partner.  </TEXT>
