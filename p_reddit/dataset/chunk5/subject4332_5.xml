	<TEXT> I find the Webelos I snapshot to be pretty interesting.  A buddy of mine completed a Wood Badge ticket that created a Cooking Academy for Webelos.  It was a fully detailed program laid out in a fashion similar to the current program.  If anyone is interested in it I could share it via Google Drive I guess... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The new advancement program </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I know this sub isn't all that big yet - but I was wondering if anyone that sees this has been part of the new advancement program that begins in 2015?

I'm getting ready to start my 4th trip through the ranks with my youngest son and hearing there is a new program was especially exciting to me as I've seen the old program 3X now.  I will have a Tiger in September 2014 and would love to see the new Tiger program in advance.  The only thing I've seen so far is this:

[Cub Scout Overview](http://www.scouting.org/filestore/program_update/pdf/2015_Program_Change_Overview_Cub_Scouts_Boy_Scouts.pdf) which isn't big on actual rank program details. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pack Meeting Idea: Sockwar </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm getting ready for my second go round in Cub Scouts.  I held just about every position in the Pack last time so I'm starting off as Cub Master right off the bat this upcoming year.

When I was a Den Leader last each Den was responsible for the theme of a pack meeting.  Having a real been there done that feeling led me to find this idea:

[SOCK WAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdfGddHDnso) - not my video, just a sample.

We had each family bring one package of white tube socks to the meeting.  We gathered a bunch of cardboard and a few rolls of duct tape.  While the parents rolled each of the pairs of socks into a ball the boys were split into 4 teams of diverse rank.  Then the Den Chiefs   other leaders worked with the boys to create forts using the cardboard and duct tape.  The socks were divided up into 4 bunches and distributed to the teams.  Then the war began.  We had 4 or 5 resets and had to calm a few boys down but for the most part it was a blast.  Afterwards we gathered all the socks and donated them to a local group that provides clothing to the needy.  You wouldn't believe how happy they were to get them! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The last time I did this was a few years ago.  Some things I was sure to do that I didn't see mentioned in the other responses:

1. Be sure to show everyone the first aid kit you have.  Review the procedure for cleaning and bandaging a cut.  I always joke with the boys that it's been a looong time since I performed first aid - so you probably don't want to be my first after such a long break.
2. Be very direct and strict.  Layout that if you see anyone not following directions they will be immediately removed from the training - this is your one and only warning.
3. Explain to the boys that even if you earn the chip - the parents still are the final decision as to whether or not you get or carry a knife.

Good luck!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have any suggestions but I'm looking forward to seeing if you get any kind of response.  I've looked into this a few times for my office/warehouse and there doesn't seem to be any consensus favorite in this category.  The funny thing is we have an electrical construction division and their suppliers don't even touch this stuff!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah ok.  I know a lot of places will initially hire people and keep them in house.  Once they have proved themselves they begin to let them telecommute.  So you would need to tough it out initially, then slowly get the offsite position you want and need.  Even if that is something that your current employer can't do it is something to look for.  If you do decide to leave your current employer try to do it in the best fashion possible, that way they can be a reference for that job that does let you telecommute.

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You mention in your post that you have other skills that they refuse to give you an opportunity to use.  What are they?  Can you look into finding a way to use those skills without the people that are limiting you?

What goals did you have that were denied you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've dealt with health issues with children.  It is the most difficult thing I have ever encountered.  Get educated, keep your head up and be the rock your family needs you to be.

When I was so down I felt I couldn't do that anymore I would write about it or talk to a close friend that I could confide in.  I wish you good luck and a good prognosis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks - I'm an Eagle myself.  When I'm recruiting parents to volunteer I tell them about families like ours and the friendships that last through time.  

I promised myself I would be involved in Scouting as an adult until I felt like I had paid back what I got out of it as a kid.  I've been an adult leader for 8 years now and I still don't feel finished. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because we have the same circle of friends does not mean that we need to be friends.  I can more than see that you don't like me or my wife.  Yet, whenever we try to have a social event at our home you somehow manage to make us aware of your displeasure with not being invited because you can't stand to not be involved.

I've known you for 6 years now and from the very start your know-it-all attitude and total lack of discipline for your son has bothered me.  I felt bad for the kid and did my best as his Den Leader to try to help him learn to work in a group.  He was out of control, disrupted meetings, and ruined a lot of experiences for the other kids at times.  At the end of the Cub Scout program (5 years of that) I was exhausted.  Dealing with him was draining to say the least.

As hard as he was to deal with, it was you that really drove me nuts.  You act like you know everything.  You pay no attention to schedules or deadlines.  You never respond to emails.  your son was always unprepared.  You would miss submission dates for camping permit fees and then call me the day before and beg me to let him go.  Never mind that I had already bought food for the correct amount of people, gathered activity material for the expected number of people, never mind the inconvenience to me.  I would always cave because I didn't want him to miss an event.

My parents were involved with Cub Scouts and many of the friends they made during that time are people they are still friends with today in their 70s.  I understood this and wanted to make lasting friendships as well.  In our group were three or four families that I could see this happening with.  But not with you.

You managed to insert yourself into every outside of cubs activity.  You used the other families as Daycare for your son, dropping him off so you could run errands, go out to dinner etc.  The other families would complain about it - but they would put up with it.  Your son doesn't like my son, which is fine, different strokes for different folks and also fine because he never asked to come to our house - except when other kids were over.

My wife gathered a group of the Moms together to participate in a charity activity.  You were all in and committed.  Then the day before the event you text me and say 'Sorry I can't make it, forgot I was going to Disney tomorrow.'  Who the fuck forgets they are flying to another state to visit Disney?  No one does.  You are incredibly inconsiderate and nearly stuck us with the cost of your tickets.  If we hadn't hammered you for the money I'm sure you would have stiffed us for it.

At church our boys were completing the sacrament of penance.  The priest announced several times 'If an adult wants to go to confession, please wait until ALL of the children are finished.'  I stood with my son at the very end of a long line and watched you march right in, not waiting to spend 20 minutes in the confessional while children stood patiently and waited.  When you came out I thanked you for listening to the priest - you looked at me shocked and left.  It took me another 30 minutes of waiting for my son to complete the sacrament - thanks.

Now when we have family picnics and invite some people from that group of friends you try to insert yourself and your son into them.  It's our home, our get together, yet we feel pressured to invite you and your son.  We are generally nice people but we aren't going to be doormats - sorry.  We made the mistake last year of inviting you one time.  A normally great group of kids were suddenly wrestling and throwing things in my basement, yelling screaming.  I went downstairs three times to tell them to calm down.  It was your son causing the issue - this never happens otherwise.  Did you go downstairs? Nope.  You also managed to flat out ask me in front of 6 other people how much I paid for a home improvement.  I was so stunned I actually answered you - I can't believe you had the balls to ask that.  I should have countered by asking you how much you make a year.

The final straw happened this week.  Every year I plan a family camping trip.  I invite a large number of families from in and outside of the group you know.  In a prior year I invited your family and you never even bothered to respond to the invite.  This year I have 9 families attending.  Your son must have caught wind of the trip on the school bus and went home to hammer you about it.  Instead of explaining to him that you weren't invited and oh well you Facebook message me and ask 'Can we come too?'

I explained nicely that I have 9 families already booked and the site is at capacity.  I say 'I never imagined you sleeping in the woods!' as it is CLEARLY not your thing.

Your response is classic (and your typing and posting in emails and on Facebook is horrific, it drives me nuts):  

'I would of for my child not to be leg out. Plus I was there several times with g scouts.  Don't judge a book by its cover I would of surprised u. Thx.'

I would hope that your rude comment would be the end of our relationship - but it won't be, I know that.  As long as we have mutual friends you will continue to act this way.  I'm at the point now where I think I would rather cut off the friends I have made and make new ones than continue to deal with you.

The world does not revolve around you and your child.  I am not planning this trip in order to please you and your child.  I am doing this to have fun with my family and with people I enjoy being around.  I am not doing this to spend a weekend with a boy who will be incredibly disruptive and a woman who will only be there because she doesn't want her child left behind.  I want to be with people who WANT to be there.

Here is an idea:  you plan a trip, you select the camp, you select the site, you contact the camp to make sure they can handle a large group, you send out the email inviting everyone, you coordinate that, you collect the money for the deposit, you send out the list to every family with the gear you recommend they bring, you plan the menu, you do ALL of that.  Then your son won't be left out.

Don't bother to invite me though, I don't like you.  kthxbi </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speaking as someone in his mid 40s - if you feel like that now, you better get a health program in place.  I didn't start experiencing what you are talking about until just two years ago.  I got the signal, got in shape and started taking care of myself - things are much better now.  Still can't sleep on the floor though... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been at least 5 years since I've upgraded my current setup:

55G w/ 1 5yo adult velvet Oscar

Eheim canister filter - double loaded with bio media.
Gravel
2 rubber encased heaters
A few decorations that the Oscar hasn't been able to destroy.

I bought the Oscar on a whim with my son 5 years ago after keeping African cichlids for about 5 years before that.

I'm planning on moving my 55G and the Oscar to my office.

In its place I'm buying a used 90G.  I've had such great luck with the Eheim filter that I'm going to buy a new one that is sized correctly for the 90G.

My plan is to stock it as a community tank w/ Tetras and some (approx 5) angels and a pleco.

Since I haven't looked around a LFS in at least five years, what would you say is something that has really impressed you gear wise in the past year or two?  In particular I'm curious about:

Monitoring/automation technology - this was virtually non-existent or very expensive 5 years ago.  Has that changed?

Lighting - LED is available now, is there an overall best choice of manufacturers?  I see this: [LED light](http://www.thatpetplace.com/satellite-freshwater-led-strip-light-48in-60in)  anyone have good luck with that manufacturer?

Gravel/sand - I'm leaning towards sand instead of gravel this time around.

I'm debating doing live plants but had terrible luck with them the last time I tried them 8 years ago or so.  I have incredibly hard well water that I can soften but not RO so that may rule live plants out.  I'm not opposed to CO2 - but I'd need to read up a bit on that. </TEXT>
