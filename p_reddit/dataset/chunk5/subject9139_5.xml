	<TEXT> You are right, I don't need to defend myself. However, I hope our little chat has helped him understand depression a bit better, and maybe the next time he comes accross a depressed person he won't be so judgemental. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know meditation has helped a lot of depressed people but I find it extremely difficult. I do use relaxation exercises sometimes.

I find the spiritual part of Buddhism quite offputting, since I am a convinced atheist and skeptic. Other than that I think it teaches a wonderful way of living. I have never studied any eastern philosophies in depth, but I know that some of the things I do to keep my depression at bay are quite in line with their precepts, I have just arrived there by other means. I should definitely look into this some more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a very, very addictive personality. I have on occasion spent more than 12 hours a day on a Facebook flash game. I know myself, therefore I run away from anything remotely addictive. I don't drink, smoke or take drugs and I would never, ever play TF2. Or WoW. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have a point about the medical advances, I had never thought of that.

Actually, having a baby is one of the very few things that motivate me. I would LOVE to do it, but I don't think it would be fair on the baby. I need to get better first. (And there is also the issue of the medication of course). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your advice and your words of support.

My family knows that I am depressed, I just don't share with them the specific details about how this affects my life. Whenever I have done that, I have regreted it afterwards because it only makes them feel sad and powerless. There truly is nothing they can do apart from being there for me if I ever need anything, which they already are. I agree that family can be the most reliable and genuine support, but none of them have any close experience with depression and they simply don't understand what I'm going through. </TEXT>
