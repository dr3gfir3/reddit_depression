	<TEXT> My issues with coasting/flopping:

Coasting: LeBron has shown that when he absolutely refuses to lose he is by far and away the best on the planet and of his generation. I would rather see him go balls to the wall every game and play maybe 3-4 fewer seasons just to see what he could do.

Flopping: He's the best athlete the NBA has ever seen, so it seems petty when he tries to have his cake and eat it too. There's no need to argue every call. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd probably agree for the most part. Idk about "far better" at passing; Michael was creative/productive as hell when he wanted to be a playmaker. And if Jordan really wanted to, he probably could have averaged 7-10 rebounds a game just to show he could. 

I gotta say I appreciate the way you present your opinion on this. I've run into a lot of LBJ/Cavs fans that refuse to cede anything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The off ball screening is gonna be specific to each offense, as different coaches will want different angles or posture. As for getting space, Kobe and MJ are the best of the best. Watch their footwork, look how they pivot and attack the defender's lead foot, hip, or shoulder. Stepback jumpers are your friend. Kobe against Battier, Artest, or Tony Allen or MJ against Starks, Dumars, or Moncrief would be good places to start. </TEXT>

He can stroke it (pun, haha), he can finish around the rim, he can put up weird-ass bank floaters that go in. Also, look at his back-to-back 39 pt games earlier this year. Guarded by (probably) Mathews and Green who are no slouches. It takes a special kind of player to record not just 50, not just 60, but 70 points! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So according to you, a team winning more than 50 games in a given season -- which happens every year -- means that the given decade is "watered down"? Jesus fucking Christ that sounds so stupid Kyrie might believe it. 

And according to you, taking a team with shitty players (that didn't become All-Stars, mind you) to the Finals = elevating their level of talent. Mo Williams is literally the ONLY non-cornerstone All-Star to play with LeBron in 2009. Boobie Gibson, Sasha Pavlovic, and Anderson Varejao washed out of the league, James didn't ELEVATE them in any substantial/lasting way.

	<TEXT> A) A series between 2/27 teams in one season has no implication on the rest of the decade as a whole. You're a jackass

B) This thread has nothing to do with Jordan's team's talent from 1991-1993. That is part of what we argued about last time you crawled out of your cave. You're an even bigger jackass.

C) Shut the fuck up and let this shit end. I don't want to have to block you because the humanitarian inside me believes you may have something valuable to contribute, but if you keep pestering me about inane/irrelevant aspects I'm going to report you. Go back home and jerk off about the 2000s you prepubescent mongrel. </TEXT>
