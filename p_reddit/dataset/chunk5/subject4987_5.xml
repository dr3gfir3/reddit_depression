	<TEXT> Also, from the Wikipedia page for John of Leiden, one of the men tortured and killed, a little more detail into what happened to the three men:

The army of Mnster was defeated in 1535 by the prince-bishop Franz von Waldeck, and John of Leiden was captured. He was found in the cellar of a house, from where he was taken to a dungeon in Dlmen, then brought back to Mnster. On January 22, 1536, along with Bernhard Krechting and Bernhard Knipperdolling, he was tortured and then executed. Each of the three was attached to a pole by an iron spiked collar and his body ripped with red-hot tongs for the space of an hour. After Knipperdolling saw the process of torturing John of Leiden, he attempted to kill himself with the collar, using it to choke himself. After that the executioner tied him to the stake to make it impossible for him to kill himself. After the burning, their tongues were pulled out with tongs before each was killed with a burning dagger thrust through the heart. The bodies were placed in three iron baskets and hung from the steeple of St. Lambert's Church and the remains left to rot. About fifty years later the bones were removed, but the baskets remain.

Dan Carlin did a podcast on this entire subject called Prophets of Doom. If you have 4 hours to spare, it's worth a listen. Available on iTunes and [here](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-48-prophets-of-doom/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm definitely more intrigued by the idea of Rick dying now than I've ever been in the book series. He's obviously still relevant, but they've gotten the storyline to a point where they can revolve the books around a number of different characters and not one central figure. They're like a basketball team that goes 8-10 players deep. Negan, Jesus, Dwight, Angela, Maggie, Michonne, Carl, Lydia... Rick isn't as needed anymore and I'm really starting to think he'll be martyred off. </TEXT>

For me, that's been going on hikes. I'm signing up to volunteer at two different nature reserves/centers that will fill up the weekends and days I don't have my kids.

Not sure if you're able to, but maybe take a mini trip? I'm in Florida, separated in early November, and visiting my parents in NC for Thanksgiving was a life saver. Allowed me to hit reset even though I was going to return to our home for at least another few weeks before moving out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LeBatard put it perfectly yesterday, if I was to tell you that Brad Kaaya will be the all time statistical leader in school history and declare for the NFL draft after his Junior season, you would've thought they'd have done more things. His sole *"big"* win is against college football powerhouse WVU. Yeah they were ranked, but this was not a good season for college football. Someone was going to be ranked #13 or whatever the heck they were. And yeah the team wasn't great, but we're in the ACC. Put any of the recent great college football QB's on this team and they're winning the conference. I'm not saying that you're saying he's an all timer, but to not at least make it to one ACC conference game in *this* conference? His run was a lackluster. Losing Njoku will be a bigger loss next season.

I really hate being the guy that *rips* a 20 year old and says he didn't meet expectations so this will be my last comment. I hope he gets drafted and does well in the NFL, and I'm excited for the future of Canes football. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All true. Fact remains that Kaaya still did nothing in 3 seasons. Do you want a 4th or should we try a new guy? That's my only point/opinion. I'm a Tannehill apologist and still think the Dolphins should look to draft a new QB every season until you know for sure what you have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not picking either. I personally wish the little things that bug me didn't because Aziz really knows his stuff. That Aziz vs the epilogue to Dance episode is one of the best ASOIAF things I've ever heard. It was just him, he sounded relaxed, breaking down one of my favorite chapters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem with History is it's, I'm pretty sure, 100% scripted, at least on the episodes where it's just Aziz and Ashaya, thus making it super long winded. I love Radio Westeros and you can tell that they have talking points but just converse about them instead of reading their thoughts off paper. Aziz also really likes the sound of his voice and dominates the episodes, which is a shame during the GOT seasons because we end up going a couple of months without a good helping of the Radio Westeros crew. And this is just a me thing, but Aziz sometimes gets into a habit of smacking his lips making some of their episodes unlistenable.  </TEXT>
