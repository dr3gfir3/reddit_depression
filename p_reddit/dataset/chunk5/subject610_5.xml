	<TEXT> What a shameless attempt for karma disguised as ideals re-posting something something that littered the internet. 

This was bullshit, and still is bullshit, and needs to stop.  First of all, Trump could not define fascism (neither can most of you).  Second of all the narrative goes way farther than this. 

These people are not up for the task. They have meetings in the dark because they cannot find a light switch. They have national security briefings at a country club restaurant with people taking pictures on their cell phone. Read any of his tweets. He simply doesn't understand how the government works. Look at the people in his cabinet. Aside from Bannon, who is not a Nazi, they are hysterical buffoons.  He is a moron and demonstrates it every day. He is not a diabolical madman hellbent on topping a government to become a dictator. He is not up for the fucking challenge. 

If you don't like him stop with the Nazi babble. The Democratic party needs to win elections and you all sound like babbling morons selling pencils from a cup and wearing tinfoil hats. He is a moron. That is that. If you want him gone, stop doing the childish nonsense that turned voters away in the first place. Stop calling people racists, bigots, Nazi's, or whatever the flavor of the month is when you disagree with someone. 

Seriously, what did I miss. There are so many things I cannot keep track.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a) it's like winning an argument with a sock puppet,  

I didn't claim a position on any issue. I stated realities that both sides admit to with no conclusion. 

b) you're misstating the positions of others by putting them in a really reductive way instead of engaging with them,   

I did not state anyone's opinion. I said there is dishonesty about reality and ommition of important facts to hold fast to a narrative. It is a general statement that is done by both sides. 

you're incorrect on your facts at several key points (i.e. "illegal immigration is illegal")  

WOW. Pretty sure we are done on that one?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Personally I don't consider illegal immigration a crime in itself.

Just read that back to yourself. 

We should have borders as open as possible, being a melting pot is what made America great in the first place.  

It can still be a melting pot with secure borders and a reasonable system of immigration. They are not mutually exclusive. 

but they aren't committing a true crime simply by existing within the invisible lines that we've drawn on a map.  

You don't understand the meanings of words.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for showing the auto correct. 

 Also, if a radical Christian group were to kill some people because those people had profaned the cross, should everybody rush to do dirty shit to the cross just to stick it to the murderous assholes? Or, should we remember that the cross means something to millions of non-murderous, less assholish people (no one is totally free of assholery) and maybe show some restraint?  

That is absolutely, and I think you know this, not the argument. Nothing can be gained by continuing.

	<TEXT> We know why this is posted. All this nonsense just because people cannot be honest about anything. They cannot be honest about a single comment from a single lunatic. They, and this includes every major news outlet, never quote it accurately.  They cannot be honest that secure borders doesn't mean anti-immigration. They cannot be honest that Mexican immigration is net zero. They cannot be honest that drug trafficing AND decent people looking for a better life both happen. They cannot be honest that being an illegal immigrant is both illegal and we hold a big part of the responsibility because we never had a reasonable path to immigration.  

Nobody will say any bit of information if it doesn't fit their narrative. Your narrative should be the truth assholes.  Stop trying to outdo and demonize the other side. Whatever you care about, whatever you are passionate about, whatever your cause is, lying will never do it any good.  </TEXT>
