Ethereum is the Closest Thing to Actual Magic in the Real World
Before you begin I need to inform you, dear reader, that I am a serious nerd and what follows is a double dose of nerdage that you may never recover from. Consider yourself warned.

As a kid I played Dungeons   Dragons and Magic: The Gathering. I read plenty of fantasy books and watched my fair share of anime. Dragons, medieval weapons, and sorcery occupied far too much of my time and I, like many other nerds out there, desperately wanted something like magic to be real. I would daydream about being able to channel some form of magical energy to cast spells, summon creatures, and control objects around me. Sadly, in the real world, nothing like that existed.

Until now.

Ethereum is pretty magical, and its not just that their logo resembles a Magic: The Gathering expansion set symbol:

zendikar-ethereum

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that, like other cryptocurrencies, allows you to transfer tokens to and from accounts on a decentralized ledger. In Bitcoin those tokens are (obviously named) bitcoins, and in Ethereum those tokens are ether. But Ethereum lets you do something else. Ethereum allows you to create and deploy smart contracts. Once deployed these smart contracts exist in the Ethereum space where people and machines can interact with them.

And this is where it gets really cool. Deploying a smart contract is like casting a spell. You write up the contract in an arcane magical language (one of the Ethereum programming languages which have esoteric names like Solidity, Serpent, Mutan, and LLL), and summon it into existence. This conjuring requires the use of ether, a magical fuel much like mana in Magic: The Gathering.

Seriously, its just like magic.

An Ethereum contract is like an enchantment or artifact that anyone can call by sending it ether. People, machines, web services, and anything with a connection to the Internet can interact with the smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum blockchain, a realm that no one entity can control and that is always available because it lives as a decentralized system on thousands of computers around the world. And if you dont want to share your masterful spellcraft with the rest of the world you can lock your contract down so only you can use it.

So what kind of things can you do with smart contracts? Just about anything you are clever enough to code up! You can build a contract for your clan of wizards to pool your ether and store your covens by-laws, book of shadows, and facilitate proposals and voting (known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, in the parlance of the non-magical world). Instead of relying on secret handshakes and passwords for entry to your clandestine meetings, you can use a contract to verify membership (in the mundane world this can be used to authenticate online users or control access rights to buildings and rooms like key cards). You can create your own cryptocurrency (your own magical energy) with your own rules governing it. You can create contracts that create other contracts (spells that create new spells). If youre really ambitious you can even create an entire magical world in a contract for others to interact with.

If youve stuck with me so far youre probably itching for something tangible, perhaps an example of what one of these spells looks like. Here is a quick example of a contract written in the Solidity programming language that lets the wizard cast a pretty badass spell:

scroll-code

Okay so Im being a little vague on the exact details of the badass wizardry part of the spell, but this post isnt really about the Solidity programming language so thats all you get for now. However I can tell you a little something about this particular contract. Once it has been created on the Ethereum network only the sorcerer who originally cast it can use it. If any other wizard tries to use it, it will just take their ether and do nothing. The contract also allows the original caster to destroy it if and when he/she wishes.

While you can easily create stand-alone contracts like the one above the greatest value will come from contracts that interact with the real world through mobile and web apps, Internet of Things (IoT) embedded devices, and contracts that interact with other smart contracts in the Ethereum space.

Ill leave you with a word of caution in case you get inspired to build something with Ethereum and look to pitch your idea to investors. Modern finance may be a twisted black art, but VCs dont take too kindly to talk that sounds of witchcraft and Harry Potter. Stick to phrases like FinTech and disruptive innovation and your pitch will go over much smoother. Its important to remember that Ethereum is cutting edge technology and it should be treated as such, especially when large sums of money are on the line.

But dont worry, despite your tech and business jargon deep down youre really a badass crypto sorcerer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course, you can't assume every mildly creepy person has a cold, dark heart. Some people have been through the ringer in life, and are simply trying their best to interact. As long as no one is getting hurt or upset, then the only thing you can do is tip your hat and walk away. But what about truly bad people? Like, the ones who are "out to get you"? Below are some signs to watch out for so you can steer clear, and keep yourself safe.

1. They Take Pleasure In Other People's Misfortune


You trip and they laugh hysterically. There's bad news on TV, and they get out the popcorn. This, um... happy reaction to other people's misfortune is known as schadenfreude. It's defined as "exquisite joy and smug satisfaction from contemplating and reveling in the misfortune of others," according to Adrian Furnham, Ph.D. on Psychology Today. Pretty creepy, to say the least.

2. They Make You Feel... Strange


Bad people  AKA those who don't have your best interests at heart  can give off some mighty weird vibes. It can be so strong, in fact, that your intuition kicks in and tells you to GTFO. "If something feels off or if a 'friend' makes you feel uncomfortable, trust your gut... Intuition is a powerful force that should never be ignored," said Michele Corvi on HuffingtonPost.com. I couldn't agree more.

3. They Are Mean To Animals


Anyone who is mean to animals sucks. There's no doubt about that. But did you know that it's almost always a predictor of deeper issues? "Since the 1970s, research has consistently reported childhood cruelty to animals as the first warning sign of later delinquency, violence, and criminal behavior," noted Joni E. Johnston, Psy.D., on Psychology Today. Whether the cruelty happened 30 years ago, or five minutes ago, take it as a clear sign that this person is bad news.

4. They Use Humor To Insult You


There's nothing funny about being a complete jerk, and yet jerks tend to use humor to knock others down. Think of the classic movie bully who gets the whole school laughing by making someone the brunt of a joke. Not cool.

5. They Lie All The Time


We all tell little white lies  about why we're late to work, or why we're "too busy" to hang out. It's usually no big deal. But evil types take their lying to the next level, and even engage in some expert lying tactics. They might, for example, be super truthful as a way of building people's trust. Then they'll unleash some lies when trying to get their way, according to Jeff Wise on Psychology Today. How incredibly manipulative.

6. They Are Manipulative


Speaking of which, manipulation is another good sign that someone ain't great. And again, these people are very good at what they do. "Manipulators often voice assumptions about your intentions or beliefs and then react to them as if they were true in order to justify their feelings or actions, all the while denying what you say in the conversation," said Darlene Lancer, JD, MFT, on PsychCentral.com. See what I mean? Someone who stoops to those levels is obviously not worth being around.

7. They Belittle Your Fears


Keep an eye out for people who turn your worries into a joke. "If you need a little comfort because you're worried about getting a job or think your best friend is mad at you, [they] shouldn't be mocking your concerns," said Elise Williams on EliteDaily.com. And yet  you guessed it  crappy people probably will.

8. They Don't Feel Guilt Or Remorse


Let's say you were having a bad day and took it out on your partner. Maybe you were kind of cranky, or didn't feel like hearing about their problems. This happens, and is usually followed up by some pretty intense guilt, right? Well, with cold-hearted people, the remorse never comes. "Their brains simply lack the circuitry to process such emotions," wrote Mike Adams on NaturalNews.com. "This allows them to betray people, threaten people, or harm people without giving it a second thought." Yikes.

9. They Have A Total Lack Of Empathy


The type of person who hurts animals, or lies for personal gain, is the same type of person who lacks empathy. This is the ability to feel or share in another persons emotions, according to Susan York Morris on Healthline.com. It ties in with that aforementioned lack of remorse, and can be quite scary.

10. They Are Racist And/Or Sexist


Let me go ahead and address this, while we're on the topic of bad people. Of course racism and sexism are their own separate issues, and they don't need defining. But let's go ahead and agree that people who "indulge" in either one are clearly closed off to the fact that everyone is equal. And that's not OK.

11. They Don't Have Many Friends


This may not come as a huge surprise, but people with all of the above traits won't have many friends. And yet it's not for the reason you might think. Usually, evil people only want friends when it benefits them, according to Marcina Cooper-White on HuffingtonPost.com. So they'll likely push others away, or not make an effort to form friendships, unless it's for person gain. Gross!

If you've reached the end of this list and feel a bit in shock, remember this: there are many reasons people might come across as "evil." They may have suffered some trauma, or they may be struggling with an illness. Not everyone is bad for the sake of being bad, and that's an impotent distinction to make. </TEXT>

The internet has no shortage of travel inspiration lists but how about the absolute best places of nature in the world?

Heres your ultimate nature bucketlist with 17 of the prettiest places in the world

 norway

1. Preikestolen, Norway

When I first saw a picture of Pulpit Rock (in English), my first question was why have I not been here!? my second question was when can I be here!?. For just a 3-4 hour hike, these are some remarkable rewards.

 

 northern lights

2. Northern Lights, Northern Scandinavia

While theres no guarantee youll see them if you come all this way, this perhaps just makes it all the more bucketlist worthy. This is likely to already be on your bucketlist, but perhaps this photo will lead you to place it further up the list.

 

 glow worms

3. Waitomo Glowworm Caves, New Zealand

The glowworms that light up Waitomo cave are unique to New Zealand and create a unique viewing opportunity if pictures can truly tell a thousand words, Ill leave it up to the above photo to convince you!

 

 banff

4. Banff National Park, Canada

6,641 kilomtres of untouched, pristine beauty in Canadas oldest National Park. Anyone who ventures to Canada should undoubtedly have this one on their list.

 

 argentina glacier

5. Perito Moreno Glacier, Argentina

It should come as no surprise that Perito Moreno is one of Argentinas most popular attractions. How about that view!!!

 

 uyuni

6. Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia

When I went to Bolivia earlier this year and wasnt able to make the trip to Uyuni, you could imagine the look of disappointment on my face when I realised I would be missing the very reason I travelled to this country in the first place. But alas, time is on my side and Uyuni remains on my bucketlist.

7. Yosemite National Park, California, USA

If you live in the USA, youll hardly be surprised to learn some of the best National Parks are right there in your backyard. But arguably the best of these (though Yellowstone is similarly jaw dropping) is Yosemite in California. Regardless of the debate, Yosemite is a must at least once in your lifetime.

 

 vietnam

8. Ha Long Bay, Vietnam

A UNESCO World Heritage site and Vietnams most popular tourist attraction, Ha Long Bay is as stunning in real life as the images portray. Just be sure to expect crowds (and lots of them), this destination has become a hot spot over recent years. 

 

 angel falls

9. Angel Falls, Venezuala

Although quite out of the way, a trip to Angel Falls will be all the more special if you are really looking to get off the grid. Be sure to combine a visit with the Amazon and other locations in South America, one of the worlds less-explored regions.

 

 Patagonia Chile

(image: World of Wanderlust)

10. Torres Del Paine, Chile

 Torres Del Paine in the South of Chile is one of the most hiked routes in the world  and its not hard to see why! The W trek lasts 4 days and offers travellers some of the best scenery you will find the world over.

 

 everglades

(source)

11. The Everglades, Florida, USA

 The Everglades are a great day trip for visitors in Florida and will show you just how diverse and absolutely stunning this state is. Florida has much to explore beyond Miami, Orlando and indeed the Everglades, so take a slow pace on holiday here.

 

 lebanon

(source)

12. Jeita Grotto, Lebanon

These limestone caves span nearly 9 kilometres  complete bliss! Lebanon is one of the lesser travelled countries that has so much to offer travellers, so if youre looking to get off the beaten path this is a great place to start.

 

 vietnam (source)

13. Sn ong Cave, Vietnam

This is the biggest cave in the world. Can I just emphasise that once more 

IN THE WORLD.

  australia (source)

14. Great Barrier Reef

Australia on the list? Im sure it comes at no surprise. This country has some of the most natural, untouched scenery in the world  and theres a lot of it! Australia is very sparsely populated and due to its isolated location, its still very undiscovered. To really enjoy your time here, plan for a minimum of 3-4 weeks.

 

 mount everest (source)

15. Mount Everest, Nepal

If youre into hiking or climbing, Nepal is your type of place. There are now more people than ever climbing to the Mt Everest base camp  so dont expect the serenity you might have pictured from novels and autobiographies. But nonetheless, it is still one of the most beautiful scenic locations in the world.

 

 

 national park

16. Jiuzhaigou National Park, Sichuan Province, China

All the colours of nature merge together here in Jiuzhaigou National Park. This stunning scenery is so surreal that youll be left wondering how real reality is and whether your dreams are indeed even dreams. The closest town to the park is Songpan.

 

 Horseshoe bend

17. Horseshoe Bend, Arizona, USA

 Last but not least  a little gem I found in the state of Arizona, just a short drive North of the popular Grand Canyon. Arizona is full of eye candy just like this.

	<TEXT> After a church funeral service, the widow of the deceased came to see me in the organ loft and said, "Your music helped turn what could have been a mournful occasion into a celebration of my husband's life. Thank you."
I've never forgotten her kindness and thoughtfulness in saying so. </TEXT>
