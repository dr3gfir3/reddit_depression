	<TITLE> Who took the duty of reviewing viral videos from Ray William Johnson? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's been 7 months since the last =3 video came out. Now with the popularity of RWJ in 2014, it looks apparent that reviewing viral videos should have become a thing. But instead the content creators of YouTube have moved to vlogging their life, creating reaction videos, performing social experiments etc. 

Why isn't anyone reviewing viral videos? Because new videos don't stop being viral.
