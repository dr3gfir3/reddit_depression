	<TEXT> No not really. If i have any bias it is against politicians who have been lying to the American people for decades and enriching themselves int he process. I will bring another comment I made over here:

Well that's only half the argument, we have decades of lies and misrepresentation from establishment Dems. I am not arguing Trump is perfect, no human is, but I will stand by my argument that he is more trustworthy than the likes of a Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid.
Harry Reid literally bought land on a river and then supported a project to build a bridge on the land he owns. He also sold all of his Exxon(?) stock before passing regulatory legislation that would cause their stock to drop.
There just isn't enough data on Trump to even compare to the dishonest Democrat establishment. The question was about Dems, but I would make very similar arguments for establishment Republicans too.

	<TEXT> I would prefer the churches carry this burden, but then we would need church participation to rise as well. 

Anyone know if church participation is up or down?

Edit:

Church attendance in advanced industrial societies is in gradual general decline with people shifting from weekly to monthly or holiday attendance. Sociologists have attributed this trend to a number of reasons, starting from a simple boredom during services and lack of motivation, to generational incompatibility of belief systems and social changes attributed to modernity.[62] Research across 65 different nations showed that out of 20 advanced industrial countries - 16 demonstrated a declining rate of monthly church attendance.[63]

	<TEXT> The Afghan ambassador recently said; 

The Obama administration was the most academic administration we have ever had to deal with but the Trump administration has been the most thoughtful and intelligent.

It is in line with what you are saying about the Obama appointee for DoE. I am not saying Rick Perry is thoughtful and intelligent, but I have seen quite a bit of evidence that Trump is and some people around him, like Mattis are. 

I often think the difference is priorities between Trump supporters and other people, so if you are trying to convince them with something like climate change it won't work because it is not important to them. I realized this when a friend was trying to 'convince' me of how wrong I am. 

Full quote and link to article for context;

http://ijr.com/2017/03/822619-i-had-dinner-with-the-afghanistan-ambassador-what-he-said-about-the-differences-between-trump-obama-is-stunning/

"I've personally met with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the president has had two phone conversations with President Ghani [The president of Afghanistan]. One call was after he won the election and one after [Trump] became president. Before the calls, we were advised to keep conversations short because, we were told, Trump will not be interested in the details of the call and does not have a long attention span, so it would be pointless to have a long call.

However, we were pleasantly surprised at how much time President Trump spent asking very informed questions. The first time the presidents spoke, the questions Trump asked impressed us. How can you win in this fight [against terrorism]? he asked. What do you need to become financially independent? and How can American business invest in Afghanistan? How can we develop businesses and mining in your country?

Trump would listen intently after each question, often asking follow-ups. Trump's second call with our president was even longer than the first. Asking these types of questions for our country is something the Obama administration never did. The Obama administration was the most academic administration we have ever had to deal with but the Trump administration has been the most thoughtful and intelligent.

Trump continually asked How can you win? What does Afghanistan need to win? in reference to our fight with terrorism. Trump wants to win. Sincerely. All the Obama administration wanted to do was not lose.

The Obama administration was hesitant with us. The enemy could sense that. When the Obama administration announced its plans to pull troops out of the region, they announced the exact date they would do it. All our enemies had to do was wait [Obama] out. They knew the date they had to hang on until  which gave them the will to fight. They used that time to recruit and build up resources.

To bring real reform, we must be able to defeat enemies outside our country and inside. We must overthrow the Afghan warlords who are profiteering off the war. Every time we tried to remove one of them from power, [Secretary John] Kerry would say "no" because it would potentially make it unstable and require more troops be brought in. The entire Obama administration was too cautious, but Kerry was the most cautious. Perhaps the Obama administration was fatigued by the time we assumed power. [President Ghani assumed power in September of 2014.] But Trump is very different from Obama in this way.

This is good, for the future of Afghanistan." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 2016 presidential elections illuminated how polarized America has become and how independent and outsider candidates are becoming increasingly appealing to voters. The resulting Trump presidency and the response from both political parties to continue with the same failed status quo approach is broadening political polarization throughout the country and disconnecting the political establishment from its constituents.

I would argue it is what the 'outsider' candidates were promising that was the appeal. The article does a good job of pointing out what the parties are doing wrong, but I think as voters we should focus on what the outsiders were doing right. We need to encourage the behavior of Bernie or Trump, depending on your personal views, no matter their party.

We are not tied to the Democrats or Republicans. We should be thankful people like Bernie or Trump used the Democrat/Republican system to get attention, but it is sad that they have to.

Both parties are corporations and their products are politicians and political action. We are not their primary customer anymore. They own the voting systems, they get all of the media attention and they provide very little to the people for it. 

I have said it before and will say it again, Fuck the Democrats and Fuck the Republicans.

Do your part to MAGA and stop supporting 'establishment' Republicans and Democrats, they do not support you. </TEXT>

Accosting them in public is not enough. These people forgot their rights by disagreeing with us. 

Then we can get all the conservative literature and thinkers and get them too. 

It's justified because we disagree politically.

I also need to look more into the water vapor question because I have seen a scientist present data that it is not rising and data that it is. Water vapor appears to be tied to temperature so I could see it going up and down. Since water vapor is a much more contributing factor to warming than CO2 this is an important question. 

As to what is more important I would say first and foremost would be improving the opportunities for inner city families. This is school opportunity, work opportunity and community safety.

Another problem would be ending regime change policy. I think if we really want to be concerned with the earth we need to stop bombing the shit out of it. I am all for helping people, but you know actually helping them not just killing their dictators or bombing them.

I know these problems are not mutually exclusive but the above two are way more important than climate change in my opinion.

Returning to the helping people over seas idea, one of the big arguments against a global effort to tax carbon or cut CO2 emissions is that there are people in developing countries with out much option. They have not gone through as significant of an industrial revolution as us and we should not be limiting their growth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is everyone reading? I am currently reading, The Twilight of American Culture by Morris Berman. It is an interesting look at the income divide, declining respect for education for educations sake and general cultural decline. He has prescriptions for preserving culture but I haven't gotten their yet. 

It is interesting but written before the internet really became what it is today, which I would posit is it's own major cultural development. 

So that's me. Anyone else? </TEXT>

I am not going to put my morals over someone elses, making a decision for their own life or their childs life. But I will happily see my tax dollars help that child.

I understand your argument, it is very similar argument to what christians businesses or churces make about being forced to pay for birth control or abortions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a good point, the standard may not be high to everyone. But if you are a christian and one of your standards is the school is christian then it fits the mold. 

So you're right. For everyone a private school may not be meeting a high standard. There have been plenty of charter schools who do not meet a standard I consider to be high. so when selecting a private school individuals are using any number of standards to make their decision.

	<TEXT> To put some perspective on it;
A couple making 100,000 a year with 2 children is paying probably close to 20% of their pre-tax income on childcare if both parents work full time. 

A couple making 80,000 a year both working full time is probably paying closer to 25% of pre-tax income. 

Childcare is incredibly expensive, and people making the above amounts are most likely not able to get State or Federal assistance so they are paying more per child, at least in my state, than people making less than the outlined. 

It is shitty for everyone because childcare is very expensive but acting like couples maing 100,000 are high eanrers is not very accurate and they carry a heavy cost for childcare. </TEXT>
