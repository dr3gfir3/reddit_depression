	<TEXT> I was wondering if anyone can recommend a mod that will change your entire outfit (armor plus weapon) with one click?

E.g., one heavy armor outfit, one sneak outfit, one mage outfit. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, I know adrenaline takes over and people revert to what they know, but I would probably not be going for submissions from the bottom in a street fight. A much better gameplan would be to control posture, kill space, sweep, then smother them until they quit, or if life depends on it, choke them out from top position (e.g. arm triangle).  

Defending ground and pound is a fairly specialized skill that a lot of gyms don't teach - it's one actually good thing I learned from gracie combatives-style curricula. 

EDIT: Chill guys, I'm just saying in a real fight the priority has to be to get on top vs. trying to end it from the bottom and possibly getting your face rearranged. Feel free to explain why you disagree.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is incredibly good advice. At lower belts, I spent SO much time trying to work things out with specific moves I didn't get, literally losing sleep over it. I truly believe that time was wasted (or at least not spent optimally) because I should have realized I just didn't have the fundamental understanding or technical framework to get it. 

I realize now it was like trying to learn linear algebra before being fully comfortable with arithmetic. All learning is good, but not all time is equally well spent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> REALLY depends. Shin-on-face in RARE circumstances can be used as a proper, technical position. E.g., Marcelo uses shin-on-face to finish the arm crush from mount, but I guarantee he isn't grinding it down. 

There are some other straight armbar finishes that kinda/sorta involve knee on face. 

But I'd say in 99.9% of cases it's unnecessary, technically suboptimal, and therefore a dick move.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same here. It doesn't help that the footage they selected of his brown belt test is utter garbage and looks more like a hapkido video. 

Having watched this guy for literally almost a decade I've finally started to feel bad for him, because for the amount of time he has spent (purportedly) training bjj, he really should be much better. At this point I think he is either naturally bad at grappling, or he has spent more time chasing belts and being a huckster than actually training, or both. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like this - especially because there's a kind of poetic justice in using a lapel grip against a lapel grip. 

That being said, it seems like a pretty small foot circle would allow guarder to pummel a lasso inside your arm, blocking this. Normally winging the guy's leg out would prevent the pummel, and it does seem like his cross-pant grip is accomplishing that somewhat, but I think it'd be hard to block the lasso pummel. I could be wrong about this - can anyone explain? I recognize that there are endless counters and what-ifs, but this seems pretty easy to defeat with a small movement.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guard is hard, so keep it simple: 

In closed guard: Control his posture. When you get comfortable doing that, start to push and pull by pumping your arms/legs and see if you can move him a little. Don't even try specific subs or sweeps before you can do this. 

In open guard: defend the space between your knees and elbows at all costs. Jam your elbows into your hip creases on both sides and become like a ball or pillbug. In this position your natural frames (forearms, shins) should be able to accept some force and give you space to push and pull. Don't even try specific sweeps before you can comfortably accept force.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, that is super lame conduct by them. Saddens me too, especially when there's never been a real safety issue associated with the reap. 

For me I point it out when I myself have accidentally reaped their knee, and to be extra fair I give my opponent the chance to reset if they want (they never do, because most agree it's a lame rule)

On a white belt I might point it out if they reap my knee because we have many active IBJJF competitors and it takes a while to develop that sensitivity/recognition, but I always preface that by saying it's a lame rule and not relevant in all formats. I would never expect a reset in sparring.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He is the kind of guy where if it was just one or two things, you'd let them slide, but for him it's like he can't help but do every possible toolish thing. So every small thing about him bugs me because I can't bring myself to give him the benefit of the doubt anymore. 

For example, I like how his brown belt is ridiculously dark. Even new, I've never seen a brown belt even remotely that dark in color. Unintentional? Probably; most people don't get their own belts. But it just seems to fit his character to have a brown belt so dark that it looks black on camera.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Respectfully, I think this is a shitty attitude. Reaps are legal in MANY grappling formats and provide an extremely legitimate and effective base of operations for totally legit leglocks and sweeps.

	<TEXT> Yeah, to me the damning evidence is that they have not banned certain techniques that are obviously much more dangerous, and much more easily avoidable than a "reap." 

The example I'm thinking of is the explosive flip-to-turtle move that paralyzed that Brazilian kid. I'm not saying this move should be banned, but it's ridiculous that a reap is illegal while this (arguably) much more dangerous move is perfectly legal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Keenan threw his leg over going for more of a lasso-style control on the arm, then I saw two very distinct and obvious moves by his opponent to 1) push the leg across and 2) flamboyantly draw attention to the reap that resulted.

I agree this was pretty a pretty straightforward DQ in the end but I feel his opponent's behavior was pretty unsportsmanlike overall.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just relaying what I have heard: 

Everyone I've asked has told me the precedent is that many (not all) Brazilians dislike leglocks, and the reap helps you really secure certain leglocks, therefore Brazilians dislike the reap. Because they dislike the reap, they "invented" a safety issue to ban it. 

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not saying this is true, I'm just saying it's the popular narrative I've been hearing for years.  </TEXT>

...yeah I'm confused too. I think I've read that Daedric plane(t)s are a physical manifestation of the essence of the corresponding Daedric Prince, so I guess the same goes for Aedra. 

What I don't understand is how the plane(t)s are physical places that you could travel to. I assume it's not like our universe's "Space" such that you could travel to these planes with a space ship... or is it?

So is Oblivion space...?

	<TEXT> You have a great attitude, I don't think you're making excuses at all. The fact is, because you have this attitude and approach, your technique will probably improve much faster than his. Just keep yourself safe!

The other conceptual advice I'd like to share is about frames. Frames are your friend if you're getting smashed by big guys. Plan A is to keep their weight off you with things like armdrags and butterfly guard, but shit happens, and when it does, use frames. 

By frames I mean, use the long straight bones of your skeleton (humerus, femur, etc.) to keep their weight off of you as you re-evaluate. When mounted, put one forearm across his hips laterally, and one forearm inside his thigh perpendicular to the mat, and clasp your hands together. This gives you a safe base of operations for escapes. 

If you're getting cross-choked when mounted, there's a window of opportunity to trap one or both of his arms, bridge and roll. It will be somewhat easier to defend when on top in his guard vs. mounted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So one thing that helps me is to realize that "bad technique" (which it sounds like he is using) does actually "work" some percentage of the time, even when the other person is not necessarily bigger than you. The reality is that your technique might not be good enough at your current level to deal with the strength disparity. 

Question 1: Against bigger opponents, you need to break grips like your life depends on it. Don't try to respond without first at least trying to break grips. The second piece of advice is two-fold: one, you need to shrimp to get your body facing him as much as possible, and two, if one side of your body is fully locked down, you need to recruit your other two limbs as much as possible to defend. 

Question 2: Bottom line: he caught you in a bad spot and you got legitimately tapped. The better his position is, the less "good" his technique has to be to catch you. Try the technical approach, defend as long as you can, and tap when/if you need to. Caveat: this guy sounds extra spazzy and emotional, so you need to be extra vigilant (tap early, tap often) for your own safety.  </TEXT>
