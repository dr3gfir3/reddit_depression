	<TEXT> If I ordered it directly from Nails Inc (which is in the UK) then it would be around $14, not including shipping. Sephora has it, but it's out of stock. I put myself on the notification list for it, but I'm impatient! I'm a glitter freak so I'd use this alot! Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does anyone have any recommendations for eyeliner application, especially winged eyeliner for my eyes? I feel like whenever I use eyeliner, it never looks right. And I've never been able to do winged right. Also, product recommendations would also be appreciated. </TITLE>

	<TITLE> I want to recreate this look, but I can only find the polish used which is Pink Diamond by Nails Inc. London, and it's way too expensive. Can anyone recommend a similar/as close as possible match? Thank you!!! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Yes! I really love most of the videos I find here. And it's nice to have a better variety. And thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for introducing me to Manuel Ferrara and James Deen. OMG! Most men in porn are just boring to me, but these guys? WOW! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much. Your descriptions sound so similar to my experiences. I can't describe how much better that makes me feel. I'm really glad that you were able to learn a lot from therapy. I've spent years in therapy and I just can't seem to get it. I feel like I'm reluctant to change or face my issues. I just don't have the energy to put work into it. Being present, existing in this life requires so much of my energy that most of the time there's little left for anything else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. Yes, the med management part of the puzzle is extremely frustrating. I wish there was a test they could do to see what drugs you'll respond to best. I would pay a ton of money for something like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry for not responding sooner... I'm not on all those meds anymore. I'm only on 4 now. Lamotrigine (500 mg), Paxil (10 mg), Saphris (1.25 mg), and Abilify (4 mg). When I was on the 9 I stopped cold turkey because I couldn't stand it anymore and it wasn't helping. Bad idea, I know. I had seen several different Drs that year, so they just kept adding and adding. I didn't know which way was up anymore.

	<TEXT> Thank you for sharing your story. I apologize for not replying sooner; I wasn't feeling up to it. I'm sure you know how doing the smallest things sometimes requires so much effort.

I hope you get your meds and everything else straightened out. And congrats on making it to grad school. You must be doing something right. ;-) </TEXT>
