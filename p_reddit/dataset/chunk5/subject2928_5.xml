	<TEXT> boundaries. one they are crossed its hard to get them back up. People in your office have either gone through this or set boundaries early on. Which is hard if she's a boundary buster. 

You did well to stop the shopping but still bringing it in or telling her where you brought it is an issue. 

Keep chats work related for her and with others. However, she might notice and even direct (like saying, please stop copying me) or indirect action might hurt her or cause trouble. Either way stay professional in the eyes of the boss. 

Don't forget to lock your computer and maybe buy one of the screen shields which makes it hard for people to snoop. 

If you can't change jobs, can you get into a project elsewhere or switch teams/departments? promote your way out of it if the opportunity appears

	<TEXT> According to local police data, the number of missing child cases in the District dropped from 2,433 in 2015 to 2,242 in 2016. The highest total recently, 2,610, was back in 2001.

But the increased social media attention has caused concern in the U.S. capital area, which has long had a large minority population and is currently about 48 percent black. Hundreds of people packed a town-hall style meeting at a neighborhood school on Wednesday to express concern about the missing children cases.

Ten children of color went missing in our nations capital in a period of two weeks and at first garnered very little media attention. Thats deeply disturbing, Richmonds letter said.

Derrica Wilson, co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation, said that despite the assurances from police, it was alarming for so many children to go missing around the same time. On Tuesday night, she noted, her group had four reports of missing children and only one had been found.

We cant focus on the numbers. If we have one missing child, thats one too many, Wilson said.

Wilson said she is concerned about whether human trafficking is a factor, citing the case of 8-year-old Relisha Rudd, who has been missing since she vanished from a city homeless shelter in 2014. A janitor who worked at the shelter was found dead of apparent suicide during the search for the girl.

They prey on the homeless, they prey on low income children, they prey on the runaways, they prey online, Wilson said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was that story of pro Brexit millionaire running news services in Hungary and Serbia which matches some of how fake news is spread by these groups.

Also after Le Pen was caught getting Russian money and EU wanted to investigate this kind of funding Farage tried to block it.

Russia didn't create these groups but they are funding or using its army of digital army to help them. Sounds like they approached BNP first but wouldn't be surprised if they made contact with UKIP or sold leaders hidden shares in energy companies.

I guess a bigger example is Mandela, he did turn his back on violence and become one of the biggest spokesmen for peace. People still try to point out his past to overshadow him as an advocate peace in his later years. As people in politics go they admit they made mistakes and changed which should be done more. Maybe in a twisted way it takes someone who went through that hatred to understand the importance of stopping it.  </TEXT>

Dowson has spoken at a conference of far-right leaders in Russia and wants Trump to enter an era of cooperation with Putin.

On the role of the alt-right websites he controlled in the US elections, Dowson said he was spreading devastating anti-Clinton, pro-Trump memes and soundbites into sections of the population too disillusioned with politics to have taken any notice of conventional campaigning.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38302019

"We know the vast majority of British people don't want to buy fur ethically and morally, but we are seeing an increase in it on our streets,' says Claire Bass, director of Humane Society International UK.

"Consumers are being duped into buying real animal fur."
She adds: "Fur is tragically so cheap. It can be produced for the same or less than the cost of fake fur."

As part of an awareness campaign, the charity carried out laboratory tests on three items being sold as faux fur this winter, and found them to be made of mink, fox and rabbit. </TEXT>

We still get plenty of stories about animals being skinned alive or some fur farms using kidnapped dogs and cats to react to demands etc. Yet people still seem to be buying it or being able to buy/sell it cheaply. Have attitudes changed? 

To note it is legal to sell imported furs in the UK, just fur farms in the UK are banned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not the same as crystal therapy or the other stuff at all. 

LGBT has a high suicide rate. This kind of therapy makes the person feel like there is something wrong with them or that they are mentally ill. So as they fail to 'cure' it leaves people feeling worse than better and heightening that suicide risk. 

Would be far better for a professional to help them come to terms. If they go for religious reasons, it might be better to refer them to LGBT religious groups for spiritual support.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One issue raised as to why is Social Care units are also being shut down or dropping budgets. So all the social care needs are falling into A E. It's not really little Timmy and his sniffles, more like lonely unsupported Granny cannot be discharged due to lack of social care. 

Older people in England are being left "high and dry" by councils cutting back on the care they provide, Age UK says.

Research by the charity showed the numbers getting help had fallen from just over one million three years ago to 850,000 last year.

Age UK said the cuts were one of the major causes behind the growing pressures on A E units. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30902555

Over the past three months waiting times in A E units have reached their worst level for a decade with hospitals reporting they are experiencing particular problems trying to discharge old and frail patients because of the lack of support available in the community. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In reality more you think about it the more messed up it gets. Most real life vigilantes i hear of go after people rather than hang around waiting for crime to happen. Unlike police you're likely working off newspaper articles or the word of others which might not be true. Your just beating people you suspect are guilty so highly likely you're beating up an innocent person or they'll go to the press as a victim and people will be more sympathetic to them. Plus you'll get arrested and then beaten up in prison for it. 

Legal system can be slow but likely what makes it more fair than living in a world of mob violence over small matters.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hating or discriminating against someone for something they cannot control. Transgender people suffer lot worst abuse and threat of violence and death for being who they are. It being socially acceptable to dislike them or restrict their human rights feeds into this. 

For many transgender is a birth defect and not a mental illness (though it can cause mental illness like body dysmorphia if not treated). Like another variant of being born a hermaphrodite. So they seek surgery and medical processes to fix natures mix up. Question for many who have strong feelings against Transgender people seeking treatment is would you react the same if you met a hermaphrodite also seeking corrective gender treatment too.  </TEXT>
