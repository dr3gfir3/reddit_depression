	<TEXT> There are the top 5 action films: Predator, Die Hard, Aliens, Terminator and Robocop. Then there are the awesome John Hughes films, John Landis films, John Carpenters, a couple of Kubrick classics, and loads of awesome films like Flight of the Navigator, Teen Wolf, Crocodile Dundee, Short Circuit, DARYL, Back to the Future, Tom Hanks comedies, Ghostbusters. It was a glorious decade for memorable, endlessly rewatchable films.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They can push for certain decisions, but it will no way have a direct bearing on the quality of a film. Look at Christopher Nolan exec producing Man of Steel, or James Cameron's involvement with Sanctum. The annoying thing is that in both those examples, I heard people at the time thinking the films were directed by the big names, which is exactly the kind of absorbed mental impression the marketers are going for.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you read the Jobs biog, it comes across that yes Jobs *could* be an asshole but generally was a fascinating and complex man who did revolutionise not just one but *many* industries. I think anyone who strives for the best and feels frustrated by the barriers of common human nature is going to come across as an asshole at times, e.g. James Cameron also.   

And yes, Gates was influenced by appearing on screen at one of Jobs launches, where the audience booed and hissed him. He then compensated for his obviously bad image (despite it being from fans of the opposition). I think they're both just different people who contributed a lot in various ways.  </TEXT>

That's the great thing about Peter Weir, he really doesn't do "flash in the pan" style films, they're always layered with universal human themes and directed with a timeless depth. E.g. Witness, Master and Commander, Dead Poet's Society, they're all still just as watchable and engaging as when first released.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone just mentioned, Logan and The Girl With All The Gifts were *very* Last Of Us in vibes and ideas. Logan looked like Joel, and the relationship/trajectory was similar. Even the music felt similar in places, those sparse jangly guitar notes against the desert. If they did make a Last of Us film now, I think they'd have to adapt it in a more interesting way to rise above the imitators that beat them to it. The story of Last of Us is pretty cliche at this point.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK I have massive problems with this film too, but they aren't the same as yours. I saw it at a preview before general release, and at the time the reception was unanimously positive - I had a thread on IMDB (RIP) that gathered traction as more people saw it. Anyway, my issues with it are:  

- the other characters are fairly flat and boring, without much development. Because of this, I find it quite boring on a rewatch.  

- the "twist" feels like a contrivance. It makes the audience believe one thing about the central character, which isn't true. This makes us empathise/sympathise with her in a way that isn't earned. So when the twist happens, I waste time unravelling what I thought I knew about the character, realise I know nothing at all, then think even less of the overall character development. Basically, the one character you think you know the depth of, you don't.   

- the film didn't need its twist. The book didn't have it. I feel like it was forced in as a kind of gimmick, which doesn't help at all in exploring the central idea of the film, it just delays and confuses it. If we knew from the start that she had never had children, and could then experience her flashes as she does, without the false belief that they're flashbacks, it would have been a more honest film and allowed us to empathise with her in a more genuine way.     

- the central idea of how she handles the premonitions is messy. In the book time is completely set, and she experiences awareness of the future whilst being compelled towards it, acting everything out exactly as she knew she would. Its set - it can't be changed. The cost of awareness is losing the ability to choose anything. In the film its made out that she chooses to have the baby despite knowing its future, because its "beautiful anyway" and all that guff. This just raises too many hypothetical paradoxes that break the (interesting) idea of the original story.   

- I find the direction far too manipulative. As well as the forced twist, the use of emotional flashes, orchestral music swelling towards the end, corny-as-fuck dialogue etc just trying to ramp up the audiences suggestibility to the idea its a big, important film. It barely even explores its central idea because it wastes too much time on dull alien visit scenes and all those fucking ink circles.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An all male prison, shaved heads, "waiting to die", an "infection" which kills them one by one, having no weapons (ie cure), being all "fucked", Ripley carrying a terminal disease and coming to terms with it, trusting clements with a needle, those are some of the more overt suggestions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think one of the most important factors in producing the kind of insanity seen in Room 237 is spending too much time with a topic, and your own thoughts on that topic.  

This really doesnt make any sense. There is no logical correlation between how long a person spends with a topic and how irrational they become. Normally they just become experts on the topic, and there are plenty of people very knowledgeable about topics theyre interested in. Linking it to "your own thoughts on that topic" is a purely circular argument, like saying "people think crazy things about something because of their thoughts about it".  

Of course theres a huge spectrum where peoples individual reality varies from actual reality. Sometimes it leads to great ideas, art and culture, sometimes it leads to crazy theories and interpretations. If its about a movie, who cares? Its religious fundamentalists and those actively trying to enforce their deluded reality that you should be worried about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like Alien 3 a lot. I like its uniqueness, ballsiness, and being a sequel with its own subtext (AIDS, death, religion etc) and interesting characters. It has a great soundtrack too, and some of the shots are amazing. The CGI looks a little shoddy now, but then the alien was only ever a catalyst for the themes and story rather than the main focus. People bitch about hicks/newt being killed off, but I always saw that as an important intro to the death theme, and something that Ripley is grieving and coming to terms with as the story unfolds.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes at the cinema, if I spot a cultured looking couple I'll say "what did you guys think of that?" and usually get into a nice little conversation where we both take away a few recommendations. Its hard to cross that line though into "this has been fun, how can we keep in touch?" because it seems creepy, even if it really shouldn't be at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I much preferred the book, the film (adapted by the same author, weirdly) changed some huge aspects of the story in a way that killed some of the major themes and points of the book.

	<TEXT> I think when Dwayne is in sync with the project and director (as he seemed to be in Pain and Gain), he's brilliant. In something like San Andreas where he clearly doesn't give a shit and is acting in front of a green screen most of the time, I can see why people don't rate him. He's got range and ability though for sure. I don't think Nic Cage has even tried for 30 years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, Pain and Gain is fucking great. Its satirical writing is akin to something like Four Lions, and exceptionally well produced and edited. The soundtrack is amazing too. I think its hugely underrated because of the Bay bias, people can't seem to see through its superficial surface to realise what a piss-takey film it really is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats so depressing. Yet another story of how companies are being absolute *cunts*, making people suffer unnecessarily (imagine all the people who get caught out on losing their "reservation fee" for silly reasons) and getting away with it because no one is watching or motivated enough to do anything about it. Meanwhile they get wealthily plump along with the landlords, whilst the people paying the money struggle on. Its just so damn sad. I really hate estate agents with a passion, every single time I've had anything to do with them they've made endless mistakes and been lazy and incompetent, whilst ensuring that you of course pay every penny you owe them on time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think one of the best baddies is the xenomorph in Alien. Without saying a word, it suggests confusion and hostility, not having the slightest fucking clue what these people are, but seeing them as annoying pests and getting rid of them all. That bit where its trying to sleep in the vent and then Dallas stumbles upon it, and the xenomorph suggests "for fuck's sake, I'm trying to rest and you cunts are *still* poking around". Also, I enjoyed Zod in Superman II (although he thought he was doing the right thing as well).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My problem with the kind of character that he played is that they just don't seem overall congruent. You have this guy who does bad, knows he does bad, and then acts like he's rolling around in his badness, all with a self-conscious "hey, I'm a villain!" pantomime vibe. I much prefer villains who think they're doing the right thing (in the way that everyone thinks they're doing the right thing), but their reality is just distorted enough that it doesn't match ours, so looks "bad" from our perspective. Its a far more credible and chilling approach to a character who does bad things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use an LG G4 (any modern phone with a 1440 x 2560 res or above and a gyro should be fine), a BoboVR Z4 ($25-30ish, has built in headphones) and cmoar cinema app (about $5, there are other free ones).   

The experience is like being sat in the middle of a big screened theater. You can look around at the seats, which even reflect the light of the film, or make it you can only see the screen. Its truly immersive. The screen feels huge (its adjustable), sharp (especially with 1080p files), and the right distance away. I've used it to watch stuff like Aliens, Escape from New York, Blood Simple/No Country, Bladerunner. Its like being at the cinema but without distractions, I find myself absorbed in a completely different way to the normal TV.   

If you've tried it, what did you think?  </TEXT>
