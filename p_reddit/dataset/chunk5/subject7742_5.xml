	<TEXT> This is something I'd love to dig in on. Many people use the words "Media" and "News Organization" interchangeably. New Organizations are a group as old as the nation, if not older. They adhere to a Journalistic Integrity Code originally developed by the University of Missouri. A Media Company may have components that do, but ultimately they are concerned with using technology to reach an audience and create a profit. A News Organization will issue a retraction or correction on any incorrect facts related to an article. Additionally, with the advent of the internet, we have unlimited access to any News Organization we want. How can we blame them for being biased? If we don't like the way they are treating the facts and information of the day, isn't incumbent upon us to find another news source? </TEXT>
