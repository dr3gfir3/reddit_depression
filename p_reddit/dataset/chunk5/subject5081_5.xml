	<TEXT> Serious question. I have a book out (planning the second as we speak) and while I have great reviews, I struggle with sales. I've tried paid ads etc but nothing seems to work - what was your best strategy to drive sales?

Many thanks for your reply! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it's not. This is branding. It is rewarding the customers that spent extra money. It's surprise and delight. You paid your money and you got exactly what you knew you were getting. 

But, if you're a 'high level' customer, here! There's a surprise for you. 

Nothing wrong honestly. You can still play the game you paid for. 

Edit: removed last comparison as it sounded wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For an AAA Game: 1$ per hour (A game that I'll play but might not finish i.e. Rise of the Tomb Raider)

For an AAA Game that keeps me entertained: 2$ per hour (A game that I'll play and finish but won't miss i.e. Batman: Arkham knight)

For an AAA Game that I loved: 3$ per hour (in my case, Dishonored fits the bill)

For a superb Game (AAA or not) that makes me feel the feelz: 5$ per hour (think Firewatch, etc)

For any game that amazes me and stays with me forever: it doesn't matter the price (so far only FF7, Xenogears, The Witcher have managed to do so).


Now, VR is a different beast. I love Onward (40 hours in). I love Elite:Dangerous (60 hours in). 

But I love The Assembly, which lasted 4 hours and for which I paid 20+. I am loving Arizona Sunshine. So it depends! 

tl;dr - your price seems right :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, I understand your frustration, but maybe you bought into this too early? 

It's like buying things on Etsy. They're all overpriced because the people that make them aren't moving the same volumes as a mass-produced thing. You get to know you're supporting the indie market. 

Dante is a great example. He made one of the best VR games out there but he took a big bet on the locomotion - I was skeptical myself! But now look at us, all raving about Onward locomotion. 

**That's what I know I'm funding - the indie developer that can, eventually, become the next CD Projekt RED for VR.**

Just steer away from shovelware and you'll be fine. </TEXT>

I understand that some games might be pricey but AS has been on Steam Sale -15% for a long time at 33 bucks - 6 bucks more that we know for sure will go into the hands of the devs who bet so much on VR.

just a suggestion! Enjoy the game :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Game is one of the most polished you can play on the Vive right now. Graphics are great and is well optimised (I'm playing everything on high with a 970 and a i56400). 
Atmosphere is nice, mechanics can be better (reloading is fun but the gun barrel feels off, you have to adjust it. I am not a big fan of teleporting)

Also: finally a single-player game with a "story". Everything so far has been either a wave shooter or a multiplayer experience (I'm not complaining, I love Onward but The Gallery whet my appetite for more VR stories).

If you have 30+ bucks to spend on, do, you won't regret it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I'm hyped! 

However, there are a couple of suggestions that can make this game jump from "Oh here's another sandbox to try" to "THIS IS AMAZING". 

1) The game mechanics need to be hard not easy. Make it very hard for the players to sneak and make the Vive Mic always on so if you talk/breathe too heavily, enemies will acknowledge your presence etc. This will make the "stealth" experience so much more intense. 

2) It doesn't matter if it has 2000 levels/mazes, if there's no story to follow, after a while the game will become stale. That's not a multiplayer game, it's more a RPG game, let us follow a story with proper plot twists, voice acting, etc and we will care a bit less about how many levels/enemies/AI.

3) Right price point. A RPG sandbox with stealth mechanics priced 9.99 is already too much for me, but a fully fleshed 4-5 hours game (with future storylines as paid DLCs!) priced 29 euros it's instabuy.

I hope the devs are reading this. If you need help from the community (voice acting, story drafting etc) just try and ask - you'd be surprised! I am a writer myself and would love to help if needed :)

	<TITLE> Plex Sensor refresh rate? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-06 11:47:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,

I'm using the Plex Sensor to start a light automation to dim lights when playing a movie. It works very well but it's not immediate, my guess is due to the refresh rate of the sensor.

Can I make the refresh rate quicker? If so, what would be the terminology? Can't find it anywhere.

Thanks!

**EDIT: So apparently the refresh rate for the sensor is in the plex.py sensor file and it's set to 1 minute. I'll try to create a custom component and change the refresh rate to 5 seconds and see how it works! thanks to /u/fabfur for pointing me to the custom component and /u/iAmNotorious for the correct link** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if trackpads or sticks are better in VR, but I disagreee with you - clicking a button in VR to perform an action is immersion-breaking. 

I actually like having to reach for a "physical" object behind my back to check on something i.e. a tablet to see where my teammates and my objective is (wink wink). I like manual reloading, as I would like to reach out my back to unsheate a sword.

Onward locomotion works very well for that kind of game, but definitely they need to implement some sort of blur/reduced FOV when running / sprinting. That only might make a big difference (oh and NO rotation movemebt with trackpad, only with head) </TEXT>

Can't wait to try this one!

	<TEXT> Hey schorhr,

thanks for the tips and links! The 150p seems amazing - one question, from what I've read it doesn't seem like it has a motorised version for easy tracking. Is it something I can add at a later stage? Because that might make my life easier :)

thanks again, you're very kind!

	<TITLE> Celestron 31150 LCM 114 or 31051 130E? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-21 13:56:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,

I've been dreaming of a telescope my whole life - even if the small one I got for Christmas when I was a kid was a scam of course ;)

Now I finally can gather a bit of higher budget for a scope (I know it's still very entry level, but I'd like to stay under 300 Euros) and have found those two on Amazon for a very reasonable price:

[Celestron 31150](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Celestron-31150-Computerised-Reflector-Telescope/dp/B0036GNNCC/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8 qid=1479732155 sr=8-9 keywords=newtonian+reflector+telescope)

[Celestron 31051](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Celestron-31051-Astromaster-Reflector-Telescope/dp/B0013Z42AK/ref=pd_vtph_421_bs_t_1?_encoding=UTF8 psc=1 refRID=N0GHEF2Y3JJCJQP98N3J)


Now, if I understand the basics correctly, the 31051 should be a better choice? 

I plan to use it mostly in a very lightly polluted suburban area with the occasional (~once per month) trip to a very dark sky location (I live in Ireland - clouds are the big issue here). I plan to observe the Moon, our SS (especially our jewel of the crown Saturn) and some deep sky objects (Andromeda Galaxy would be my dream).

Your advice is highly rated guys. If no one of those two is good enough, just call it out. I'll wait and save up a bit more.

Thanks for all your help,

Clear skies!

	<TEXT> Elite Dangerous player here. I know, I'm asking you if I should jump ship to SC.

I loved Elite, and I played it with my VR headset so I *truly* enjoyed being there. But it does feel like space trucking. I mean it's a grindgrindgrind, get a bigger ship, grindgrindgrind. 

I miss a story (or even a loose storyline) where I can actually find ruins, explore them, find an object, join up with other players etc. 

I loved the vistas in Elite. I loved being inside my ship. I loved exploring and seeing black holes etc.

But now, after "only" 60 hours, I feel like it's an ocean wide, an inch deep....

...would Star Citizen be different?

Thanks to you all!

**EDIT: I'm not scared of Early Access / Alpha games, if I see a nice direction for development. I'll try the free weeks soon! Thanks to all of you for your insights.** </TEXT>

(not judging here. I have very limited playtime thanks to an amazing life I lead. This only means playing with what I really like - my Vive is currently used for Onward, or just hanging around and enjoying the Matrix. 11/11 is the day Dishonored will be out so I guess less Vive time for me) </TEXT>

If your piece is gonna be selected for publication, it will probably go online through our Medium page: medium.com/beautiful-losers/
We publish on Medium every Wednesday, and will keep the best-submitted piece for our Quarterly Review (number #0 due before Christmas 2016).

If you want more info, please head on to www.beautifullosersmag.com

	<TEXT> You're right but I didn't consider other headsets on purpose. While the screen technology is very much out there, the tracking etc is not defined yet. 

Steam does support the VIVE and Oculus and my guess is that any third player is gonna have a hard time to claim a seat at the table. The only other VR worth considering I see is PSVR. 

Plus, even if we do have a third player better and compatible headset with flawless tracking (which I doubt it'll happen in the next year anyway cause R D should have started a while ago) we still lack the installed base of more powerful GPU to drive it. Oculus is lowering their requirements to attract more people. We don't need more/better headsets yet, what we need is more people with the existing ones - cause more people = more content = more people = more sales = more content = quicker innovation = 8k VR and 1180 both 'affordable' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There won't be a new Headset for at least 1.5 years.  Even so, a new headset will require absolute power (1080). Your Vive 1.0 will still be great even if. 

Even if the new controllers/base stations ship earlier, I'm sure you'll be able to upgrade if you want. 

Eventually, this tech is gonna become like smartphones - very quick update cycles. The good thing is I believe Valve is the right choice because you'll be able to add different things etc without having to re-buy everything. They're more interested in keeping you on Steam than anything else. 

So the choice is yours. Do you want to play now or wait one year plus? 

I had my Vive for 5 months now - I use it everyday. If a new HMD would come out tomorrow, I'd buy it, but those 5 months would have been totally worth it... a list of amazing things you can do now:

ONWARD 
The Solus Project
Elite: Dangerous
A Chair in a room 
Rec Room
Altspace VR events
Space Pirate Trainer
The Lab
Paddle Up

I mean, this'll keep you busy until next year my friend. 

Buy. It. Now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that piracy is not evil per se. I think it might be even good, if you read the whole article. 

The point of the article is, If you consume content without helping the person that created the content, well then this person won't be able to create more, because he won't be able to sustain his art. 

Your logic with "illegal breathers" is kind of a stretch - no one "created" oxygen nor can claim the ownership of it. But in the case of work of arts, then you're actually damaging the artist and the future creation of content.
