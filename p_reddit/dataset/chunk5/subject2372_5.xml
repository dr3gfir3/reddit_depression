	<TITLE> Is smearing a common problem with electric water distillers? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to make an eau de vie style spirit by distilling a batch of home made cider through an electric water distiller. I've distilled it twice now, throwing away 100ml of foreshots on a 1 gallon wash and it still has an incredibly strong, biting acetone odour. So strong it makes you wince when you smell it. Is this because the still is running too hot and the foreshots are getting mixed in with the rest of the vapours? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just looked it up, there is a trademark for it under several classes. Do you happen to know what class video games or books would fall under. I see under class 16 it says, "printed matter" - does that mean books? And would games fall under, "computer software"? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> FBX Animation not Importing Properly </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to load some public domain mo-cap data into Maya. Every time the joint markers load but not the animation. It should be about a minute long but every time I load it it last for less than a second and barely moves. I'm pretty sure I've selected all the right import options. Anyone got any idea what might be going wrong? </TEXT>
