	<TEXT> I've been learning a fair bit about how long different people practice since starting music college in September. Honestly, you have to do so much to get to a professional level. My drum teacher practiced seven hours a day when he was a student, and he still expresses regret at not having practiced more. My harmony lecturer practiced 10 hours a day, and I know he's not exaggerating because I've heard a lot of people say he's one of the best in Europe. 

Sorry to drag that point on so long - but basically, it depends on your goals. If you just want to get better while keeping it a hobby, so you can be able to player harder things, an hour or two a day would be great. But if you're looking for a career in the future, I'd say at least four a day, honestly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Always wondered, and I may upgrade my pedal soon. I see a lot of pros using the 5000, many of whom are endorsed by DW and could obviously have a 9000 if they wanted it (I'd assume anyway, not really certain how endorsement deals work exactly).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really get the "overplaying" criticism - I mean, of course he's overplaying, the purpose of the videos is to show his playing over a song a lot of people have already probably heard, showing what he can do. Of course if he was playing like this with a band, he'd be overplaying to an ungodly level, but it's a drum cover/interpretation, so I don't think it's a very fair criticism, just my opinion though.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just a quick question, not sure where else to ask: How would you, as a regular music listener, define "music technology"? Would it be fair to say (if defining it very loosely) that it technically could refer to any manmade, unnatural means of creating rhythms and melodies, such as early instruments? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-07 07:00:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Asking because I have to write an essay for college. The title is "Discuss Some of the Ways that Technology has Influenced the Development of Popular Music."

One of the points I'm making is about the common instinctual idea of what "music technology" would be - that is, things like computer software, microphones etc. My point is that it really could refer to any means of creating music that has been created by humanity and not been something completely natural like the voice, the body, a stick lying on the ground as a percussion instrument etc. This would segway into a paragraph on some of the earliest instruments which I personally find would be interesting to read about. My lecturer kept hammering home two points about this essay; make it stand out from other people's; do everything you can to hold the reader's interest throughout the essay; and to interpret the title in whatever way we want, as long as what we talk about is accurate, and that it is well written and interesting. So, taking this advice, I was going to focus on the other, more common perception of the term "music technology", and talk about something of more personal interest to me; The Dark Side of the Moon. 

I like the idea of such contrast between those paragraphs, if it's done well, but my fear is that the whole first paragraph about the earliest music technology would just be considered gibberish and completely wrong. I'm getting paranoid that my thinking of "music technology" as any manmade means of creating or producing music is just plain wrong, and my lecturer would just see it as nonsense. 

What do you think? (apologies for rambliness)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been playing for seven years, and just started college studying a Popular Music course, specializing in drums! One of the first things that my college drum tutor told me was that I sit too close to the snare, and that it's causing unnecessary tension to sit that way because it results in me having to hold my elbows back, and put strain on my arms and muscles around that area. I would usually have sat with the front of my knees being about five or six inches ahead of the edge of the snare closest to my core, whereas my drum teacher tells me the most comfortable and economic way would be to sit with your knees about two inches ahead of the edge tops.

I'm working on fixing it now, but I have no idea how common this mistake is. I would think it'd be common enough for drummers who spend years without formal, personal instruction, because one would have a natural tendency to sit closer in order to be able to hit the rack tom(s) more comfortably. 

How close would you say you sit? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've just started first year in music college and we're told we have to practice the songs we have to perform in ensemble class with a click at least half the times we'd generally play them in practice. It's not too bad when the click is just in my headphones and everyone's going on my time, but when it's over the PA and everyone can hear it, it's a lot harder because the whole band is very tense and focusing so hard on the sound of the click that they're more likely to go out of time.

The only advice would really be to practice with it just in your ears on your own until you can hold the tempo with the click fairly comfortably, then you'll be better set to do it with the full band. Also just whenever there's a fast, longish fill or buildup, try and intentionally play slower than your instinct tells you, because a lot of drummers would speed up quite a bit during parts like that, so I guess compensate for it by slowing down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry if it's a somewhat stupid question, but what's the big difference between a snare like this, and a standard size snare? As in, why would one choose to play one like this, despite the physical awkwardness? I'm guessing it's just the deeper sound and impact but I'm just curious! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just a quick question, not sure where else to ask - would a "Motown song" be any song that was released on the actual label Motown, or a song that would fall into a specific genre called Motown, with a specific sound and style? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Asking because my college band has to choose a Motown song for our performance class and we're not sure what the parameters are. I really want to do either Superstition by Stevie Wonder, because it's known, really fun to play, and grooves insanely well, or Rock With You by Michael Jackson, pretty much for the same reasons. The problem is that I'd consider Superstition to be a pretty classic funk tune, and wouldn't musically speaking associate it with the likes of  'Ain't No Mountain' or 'Baby Love', pretty famous Motown classics. However, it was released on the Motown label. With Rock With You, it's pretty much a pop/R B song in my eyes, but early Michael Jackson is generally associated with Motown. This wasn't released on the label but I'd associate it with the label, and honestly I really really want to do it. 

So basically I'm wondering if, when people refer to something as a "Motown Song", it can be any song released on that label. Another one we were going to do was War by Edwin Starr, which is a Motown song released on the Motown label, so it'd work, but we'd prefer the other two! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> This is kind of urgent - how do I approach someone close, in this case my brother, about whether he's going through a worse time than everyone thought, and thinking of suicide? We don't talk much despite living together and I have no idea what to do right now. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's half past 2 in the morning, and earlier in the night I was looking for a special type of battery for a weighing scales, on the offchance there was something around the house that would have one. I was looking around my room (I share a bedroom with my brother, he's 21 and I'm 18 and we live at home), and checking everywhere. I know I shouldn't have looked in the first place, but my brother's sock drawer, which he also puts little random things of interest to him in out of convenience, was open and I saw a suicide prevention helpine card in it. It had four different numbers and it said it was open 24/7. When I found it my eyes just widened and I felt really tight in my chest and just didn't know what to do. I tried telling myself it was a coincidence, and I'm guessing a anyone reading this will think I'm over reacting and he probably just got it handed out to him in school a long time ago and left it there, and maybe that is the case, but I'm extremely worried right now. Like, more than I have been in a long, long time. No one has to read it, honestly I don't expect anybody to and I'd appreciate any advice even if you just read up to here, but I guess to explain why I'm so, incredibly worried over a seemingly small thing, I'll give a bit of backstory. 

I'm worried because I've known for a while my brother is probably depressed - my dad passed away very suddenly in January 2012 and everyone close to me suffered. I almost left school because I'd missed so much due to depression and anxiety many times, and my brother just kind of stopped going because he couldn't face it. He failed his final exams and didn't get into college, and spent the next year being very depressed and doing pretty much nothing. I should have approached him at this time or before it because it was still in its early stages compared to now, but at the time I was severely depressed myself and couldn't even think about consoling others or offering advice on how to get out of something I was neck deep in. He started a course in a low level college last September, and it went great for a while but eventually the same thing happened as when he was in school; he just couldn't face it. He fell behind on one assignment and that was it. He just stopped going in. The point of that year long course was for it to be another route to get his dream course in a well respected music school here in Cork, but he failed the course and didn't get that. I did get into the course in the music school in question that he wanted - we both have always wanted to go there - through my final exams in school, which I struggled through because I was dealing with extreme depression throughout my final year, and also dealing with the discovery that I'd been living with undiagnosed bipolar for years beforehand. I think the fact that I got the course, along with the fact that I struggled through my attempts to do what I needed to get it, like Emmet did, would be something that would bring him down a lot. I started last Monday and it's obvious how happy I've been. Like, this has been one of the best weeks of my life and I have been so, so happy with college and everything to do with it, and conversely, Emmet's been sitting at home almost 24/7, going to bed very late, watching TV or playing PS3 all day, and not looking for a job. Not to sound arrogant, but it has to be killing him to see his younger brother loving the course that he's wanted to get for so long, and failed to get twice. 

I'm sorry about rambling, I'm just so worried. We barely ever talk but I care about him. He's my brother, and no amount of tension or estrangement can change that fact. There will always be caring between us. My family would be utterly broken and unable to move on if anything happened - there have been very few times since my dad died we've been able to call ourselves a happy or functional family, and another loss would ruin my mom and younger sister. And honestly, the guilt of not talking to him would kill me. Like the main reason I haven't talked to him, besides dealing with my own struggles and not feeling in a good position to do it, is that we don't talk much and aren't close anymore. Whenever we do talk it's awkward and in passing. I think he thinks I hate him, and I often think he hates me. He's also just an angry and frustrated person, and reacts harshly to things, particularly my little sister sometimes, so honestly I do resent him for that a lot of the time and it would add to why we don't speak much. He just never seems like an emotional person in the slightest, just a normal "lad" who doesn't think of life on a deep level at all, and I guess I took that as a sign that he didn't have deeply dark thoughts. It was probably ignorant to think that. Since our dad died our relationship has been non existent despite living together and even sharing a bedroom, so you can imagine how hard it'd be to just have our first actual genuine conversation in a long time be about whether or not he's considering ending his life. I know the obvious answer is probably "even if it's small, just do it anyway, the worst that can happen is a bit of awkwardness", but honestly it'd be so uncomfortable if it turns out to be nothing. Even if it is what I fear, and he is having such dark thoughts, I don't think he'd admit it. The few times I have approached the subject of how he's feeling in the past (never directly, but generally things around that area), he's said "I'm really not in a mood, we'll talk about it later". We never talk about it later. 

I've written a list of people I could call tomorrow (close family mostly), and messaged a couple of close friends to see if they're up just if they have any advice. There's no way I'm talking to my mom about this, she would get so stressed and worried and feel guilty herself and I don't want to put her through that. 

Again, I'm sorry to have gotten so rambly. I don't know what to do. How do I approach him?

Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like how the chorus is sort of very clich-ballady (not necessarily in a bad way, it's still awesome!), but the verse is pretty ripping and fast. It's a really nice contrast and not something you'd usually find in a metalcore band's "ballad" song on an album.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been trying to get my finger control down recently, mostly for stuff like shuffles (the Perdie shuffle for eg), and have been practicing typical finger control exercises on a practice pad. You know, the ones that are like, all fingers together, index controlling the stick for 8, middle finger controlling for 8, etc. But I was wondering if any of you had any cool and effective exercises specifically for playing shuffles? I'm sick of playing every stroke with the wrist, it just sounds so rigid and robotic, not to mention how tiring it is at high tempos. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My DW9000 single broke after three months. I was 14 at the time and didn't want to make my parents angry because they knew I'd saved up for a year to get it, so I didn't try and go back to get it fixed until last year. The guys in the only music shop where I live couldn't get the part I need (replacement cam) and I don't know what to do now. I think I might drop it into my drum tutor in college at some stage. Sorry for the random drumming sob story, take care of those pedals man! </TEXT>
