	<TEXT> I hate people like this. I am glad there are still some trusting people in the world.

I was recently in France trying to return a rental car. The only gas station near the return location was an automated one that wouldn't accept any of my cards.

I asked a local if they could use their card and I could give them cash.
They swiped their card then wandered off 20m away to fill their car. 

When I tried to hand them money they didn't even want to check the amount. The car only took about E8.00 and the smallest I had was a 20. I was grateful they were so kind and trusting so was happy to give them the extra.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't seen a proper answer to your question.
The short answer is no.  Ant pee on the other hand... 
The long answer is you should keep your tyres away from ozone and extreme temperature if you want them to last. 
6 years is considered the maximum advisable lifespan in industry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am outside the US, so happy to be corrected, but the ELI5 answer is:

1. Most analysts think it doesn't make sense to pass this

2. Most politicians think it would be electoral suicide to vote against this bill right before the election.  

3. This is a good example of politicians doing what is seen to be popular with the electorate, rather than what is a sensible thing to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have so many. I don't think I can single out just one.

But last year I had a student show a picture of a scantily clad female halfway through what was supposed to be a professional final year presentation. Given that the class was half female and a significant number were muslim this didn't go down well. 

Usually it is just boring stuff like people arguing that fundamental physics are incorrect - or there are loopholes.

I once had someone apply for credit - which was denied. They complained that our course fees were higher, so it was cheaper for them to go to another (lower grade) uni in the same city. I told them please do. They were shocked - they seemed to think I earned some sort of commission or salary based on student numbers. 

Edited to add more... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In most of Germany they have separate bins for food waste - it is then composted.

In many parts of Australia there are green waste bins or green waste collections which are processed by mulch/fertiliser companies. Food waste still goes to landfill but the methane is usually captured for power generation.

The biggest issue in the US is not sending food waste to landfill, but rather the widespread usage of in-sink disposal units. This diverts food waste from a solid waste stream to liquid waste, which then takes a lot of extra energy and emissions to treat. I remember from back when I studied WWTP design, the proportion of insinkerators expected was an issue when designing the system.

	<TEXT> What was your major?

Where I was, 90% majored in ecology or management and had a hard time finding work.

The small %age that majored in stats or other more quantitative disciplines were snapped up straight away.  

I know it may seem too late to say that, but maybe it is time to look into where the demand is and upskilling in that area. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should store wine so the cork is wet. If the cork dries out it will shrink and allow air to permeate, ruining the wine through oxidation.

"Corked" wine is not from contact between the wine and the cork, it is from contaminants in inferior cork getting into the wine. 

Stelvins and similar (non-cork) closures should be stored upright though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have met Barry and seen him present a few times. He says he still keeps the rejection letter from the conference he first submitted that work to. It is along the lines of: "we receive an ever increasing number of submissions to our [tiny, local] conference, and cannot accept all of them. This year we received 67, and could only accept 60." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, just went and looked at the data. About 10% of the meat consumed in AU and NZ is lamb/hogget/mutton. So it is 4th after  Beef, Poultry and Pork. I am surprised, but in places like the US and northern europe lamb doesn't even get to 0.5%.
As for price, on average I pay about $8/kg.
