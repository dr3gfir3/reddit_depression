	<TEXT> Dr Mark Post and his team at Maastricht University used these cells to grow 20,000 muscle fibres in individual culture wells, each one a tiny hoop of greyish-white protein suspended in a gel-like growth medium that contained antibiotics and a serum extracted from cow foetuses.

After a few weeks of growth, each hoop of fibre was removed by hand, cut open and straightened out. The fibres were then pressed together, coloured with beetroot juice and mixed with saffron, breadcrumbs and some binding ingredients to form the burger  biologically identical to beef, but grown in a lab. The total cost of the project was 250,000 (215,000), funded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>    The hacked databasewhich appears to be one of the largest ever single data breaches in historyapparently contains account details for numerous adult properties belonging to the California-based Friend Finder Network, and includes customers' e-mail addresses, IP addresses last used to log-in to the site, and passwords.


   According to data breach notification site LeakedSource.com, the passwords were either kept in plain text format, or used the largely discredited SHA1 hashing algorithm. It claimed to have cracked 99 percent "of all available passwords" which "are now visible in plaintext."


   This is the second data breach at Friend Finder Network in the past 18 months. The first, in May 2015, uncovered personal details for 3.5 million active users of the site, including questions on their sexual preferencesdata which apparently wasn't compromised this time around.
