I just view Trump as a threat to our democracy. Out to make the media seem evil. Out to say we can only get our news from the president.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As we've all noticed, battlepack recipients aren't shown in the post match screen anymore. Some may think this is an innocent change to keep people from knowing who got a pack but I believe dices motives are far more evil. 

Dice will start only giving out 2 or 3 battlepack for a game of conquest and we will be none the wiser! They want us to look at those skins battlepackless and weak. "I just want the dough boy skin" you say to yourself as you give in and buy premium for the superior packs. Just what those bastards wanted 

There's shenanigans afoot.

	<TEXT> The automatico storm was much better at range than a lot of people know. You could kill somebody from 30-40 feet if you pop fired it just right in 4-5 bullet bursts. I'm worried a nerf to horizontal recoil makes this a lot harder. I'll find out for sure when I play the game again tonight, I'm just over reacting for the lulz. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I liked the activision philosophy when I played COD more, aka never nerf shit. 

I hate nerfs. Just a way for dice to attack players that have gotten great with certain guns.

These fuckers just nerfed 3/5 of my top guns.  </TEXT>
