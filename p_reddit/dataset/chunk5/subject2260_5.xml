	<TEXT> Was back in high school. Things were getting hot and heavy until I tried taking her pants off. There was a swamp-green streak in her panties that smelled like a fish's asshole. We didn't even get to the sex part and I still consider it the worst sex I've ever had. It still haunts me to this day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woah, dude. So sorry to hear about this. I went through a very similar thing when I was in grad school late last year. Everything went wrong at once, including my cat after I took him to the vet for a routine physical exam and the veterinarian determined he had multiple myeloma. I was desperate to save him and spent all my grad assistantship money on meds and treatments. He died 3 weeks later and I was a total wreck. This happened at the same time I learned grad school wasn't for me and dropped out, also when my girlfriend at the time didn't have the heart to break up with me in person so she sent an email without any explanation instead.

Feel free to PM me if you need to talk it over, buddy. I'm more than happy to provide a listening ear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit lol. I can only imagine what his anxiety would've been like at the first few interviews after this one if he didn't get the job. Does your friend and the interviewer have a decent relationship now? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a freelance Copywriter, I don't do many interviews in-person or over the phone. Usually just exchange some emails back and forth to get a feel for a project.

This one guy from a small tech company required some writing samples before we went ahead with his project. I accidentally attached a short screenplay I wrote that's extremely crude and violent. It was about a husband and wife who discuss how the husband potentially received a grisly wound on the side of his neck after a night of heavy drinking. It's revealed in the end that she tried to kill him while he was asleep, but she was too drunk herself to be accurate. She tossed the gun in the garbage thinking he was dead and figured she'd deal with it in the morning when she was sober. The next day, he realizes it was her after he goes to vomit in the trashcan where she left the gun. He pulls out the gun, encased in vomit, and shoots her in the head like 6 times.

The dude replied like an hour later saying he decided to pursue other candidates. Oh well, at least someone read my screenplay. </TEXT>
