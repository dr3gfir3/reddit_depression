	<TEXT> Why is it that society gets more angry at words than actions?

For example: The Minnesota Vikings suspended its special teams coach for a dumb anti-gay remark. The coach was an ass and he needed to be condemned. However, Adrian Peterson was deactivated for one game for leaving permanent scarring on two young children.

Additionally, Richie Incognito received a worse punishment for his actions. Again, he was wrong and I do not feel bad about him not having a team. 

It reminds me of how Donald Sterling was only forced to give up his team after he told his girlfriend to not hang around with black guys, rather than giving up the team after he was proven to have descriminated against minorities.

Can we punish violence and actual actions more than words? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A chance? Of course. Manhattan is a sneaky tough place to play. K-State has beaten some great teams there, including a USC team that would win the Orange Bowl. You can't count out Bill Snyder. 

However, the reason I like Auburn is because I think they have the talent advantage and a great coach. I'm a big drinker of the Malzahn Kool Aid and Snyder doesn't have a big coaching advantage over him compared to Mack Brown or other guys in the nation. 

Plus, K-State has question marks on defense from what I saw in the Iowa State game. They had a pretty solid second half, so maybe they have momentum. 

I think it's a game through three quarters, but I like Auburn to win 42-27.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll do two:

1. I would have used Miguel's death as the beginning point to spark LaGuerta's belief about Dexter being a killer. Miguel and her were friends and knew each other. This makes Season 3, in my opinion one of the weakest seasons, more important. Plus, one of the biggest flaws of the show was connecting the seasons together IMO. No need to re-write Season 3, but at least mention the death in Season 7 or something. 

2. I would have kept one of these three people alive: Brian, Trinity or Doakes. Let's say one of them escapes. Then, bring him back for a final showdown of sorts in Season 8. Perhaps the final scene of Season 7 alludes to them being back? How about Trinity or Brian spying Dexter and Deb as they're walking away at the New Year's Party? Another big flaw of Dexter, particularly in Season 8, was introducing too many new characters. For the final season, bring one of the best villains back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree on Miles, but I wouldn't rule out Harbaugh for a few reasons:

1. He doesn't get along with his general manager in San Francisco. There's also reports that some of his players don't like him. If San Francisco has a disappointing season, I could see him trying to bail. 

2. $$$$$$$$. If Michigan wants to resurrect its football program, they may throw a blank check at Harbaugh. 

3. I think his attitude and style is more appealing for a group of 18-22 year olds than professional players. Don't get me wrong ---- I think he's a GREAT coach and his record in the NFL shows that. However, I just think he's a better fit at the college level and if there's one college job that can get him to leave the NFL, it's Michigan. 

Do I think Harbaugh goes there? Probably not. But I wouldn't rule it out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the ship has sailed on Miles to Michigan. Similar to Saban and Texas, I think Miles is closer to retirement and I think it's too late for him to make a move to Michigan and rebuild that program. 

I don't think Harbaugh is as much of a long shot as many think. There's a lot of buzz that he doesn't get along with the ownership and general manager in San Francisco. A report came out today that he's lost the lockerroom. While I'm sure some of this is probably not true, I do think where there's smoke, there's fire. If Michigan loses three or four more games, I could see them throwing a blank check at Harbaugh. 

Plus, I think Harbaugh is more of a college coach than NFL coach even though he's been very successful so far in the NFL.  </TEXT>

2. AFC North: I expect rebound seasons for the Steelers and Ravens. I still think Cincinnati is a threat to win the division again. I also think Cleveland will be improved and the Manziel drama will be interesting. 

3. NFC West: I would have had this my number two until Bradford got hurt. I still think it'll be the best division, but I think there's a wider gap between first and fourth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My handful of changes to Dexter post-season 4:

- Merge the Lumen and Hannah characters into one. Not a biggy, but I think this series suffered from an overabundance of characters. Cut one of them out. Even if you have Lumen leave in Season 5, you can always bring her back. 

- Midway through Season 5, have Dexter commit a sloppy kill that leads to suspicion from Miami metro. Whether it's a blood-slide or any other piece of evidence that could link him, do it. As Season 5 moves on, LaGuerta and Deb slowly become suspicious, both remembering that Miguel Prado and Dexter were great friends. Make Miguel's murder comeback and haunt Dexter. 

- Deb catches Dexter/Lumen at the end of Season 5. That's the final scene of the season. 

- Merge Seasons 6 and 7 into one final sixth season. The plots of Season 6 and Season 8 really did not matter towards the end game. Season 7 was a strong season even with its flaws. In the first half of Season 6, have one final bad guy that's eliminated. Save the second half for a manhunt of Dexter that results in a final solution to the show.  </TEXT>

It's a shame many fans in the future will look back and say "how did they win the title?" since they didn't have a superstar. 

The '11 Mavericks and '04 Pistons were similar teams. Veterans all over, great coaching and multiple guys who were not afraid to take the big shots. 

Neither team deserves to be called a "weak champion." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still watched this show for its entire run. I'm not someone who can "give up" a show when I'm three to four seasons in. 

But I think this show jumped the shark when it went from a vampire/human show to a monster show. I think four or even five seasons of solely vampire stuff could have worked. Sometimes you go overboard and try to create a lot of things. True Blood failed in later years because it put quantity over quality, in my opinion. 

In regards to the final, I thought they were setting up the Bill human conversion. There were two hints that it was happening and instead, they killed him off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Season or just final episode?

- Season: Without writing too much about it, I would pick Season 8 right up where Season 7 left off. Investigation of LaGuerta's crime scene. Investigation continues and by the fourth or fifth episode, Miami metro figures out Dexter's secrets and a manhunt begins. The series ends with Deb killing Dexter. Not too detailed. I would not introduce one new character this season. No new bad guy. It's Miami metro/Deb vs. Dexter. I know they did that in Season 2, but that's the only way you could have ended it. 

- Just the final episode: I'd keep Deb alive. No Lumberjack madness. Dexter doesn't ditch his son with a woman who's a serial killer herself. One scene I add for sure is some type of montage of members of Miami metro finding out about Dexter being a killer. Even if the current final episode had at least confirmation Miami metro figured it out, it would have ended on a better note for me personally.  </TEXT>

- The Tuck Rule: It launched one dynasty and sent the other team to a total tailspin. Yeah, I know they made the Super Bowl the year after but I don't think they ever recovered. That was Jon Gruden's last game as the Raiders head coach. It's hard to say what happens if the Raiders win that game. But since it's fake, let's say they win the Super Bowl. Gruden and Al probably work it out, at least for a few more seasons. No Callahan. No Art Shell Part 2. No Norv Turner. That game sent the Raiders to where they are today.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How I did it:

- I started walking two miles a day, hell or high water. Walking three straight weeks gets you into an exercise habit. After walking for three months and losing 50 pounds, I started doing TaeBo. After a year with TaeBo, I started doing Insanity, where I lost 100 pounds in seven months. Bottom line: Start slow, especially if you weighed A LOT like I did. Gradually increase the stress of your workout. I did not go to the gym once.

- I gave up liquid calories and stuck to water, tea and unfortunately, Diet Mountain Dew. Liquid calories pile up quickly.

- Keep track of your calories. Moderation is important. You can cheat here or there....but you can't go overboard.

- Find a way to keep your accountable. I used Facebook and my 1,000 plus friends. I celebrated milestones. I noted when I failed. Compliments, encouragement and help from friends goes a long, long way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I liked Season 7. It wasn't great, but I liked the new characters introduced and the season finale was a pretty great episode filled with drama. 

My big beefs with Season 8 were the following:

- The LaGuerta murder never being addressed. This should have kick-started the final season. Instead, we get a bench.

- Too many new characters in the final season. To me a final season needs to develop core characters even more and bring them towards an ending. This....did not happen. I thought Matthews should have played the role the female doctor. Also, substitute Bautista and Quinn for Elway and the U.S. Marshall. Those two changes would have been a major improvement. 

- The finale to me wasn't as bad. It was the episodes leading up to it. Season 8 never felt like the final season. That's a problem! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not all. Most people I know think Cleveland should keep Wiggins. 

I've went back and forth on this, but I'd make the trade for Love. Wiggins is unproven. Love, while he has flaws, is a Top 10-12 player in the NBA. He's only 25, so it's not like they're trading for an aging star and mortgaging the future. 

Plus, with all the discussion about how the Big 3 were flawed and how tying up so much salary into three guys could hurt, the Heat DID win two titles and make four Finals. If Cleveland wins two titles in the next year, it's worth it. And while I hate being "that guy," the Paul George injury is a reminder that you need to win as soon as possible. Wiggins may take a few years to develop into a good star. I don't think Kyrie's quite there yet, though he's really solid. Love is there, however.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've said it before and I'll say it again: Shaq has become underrated since he retired. He's the only player I've seen in my life that made a 30-point, 20-rebound game look routine. 

Michael Jordan was the best overall player in NBA history, but I've never seen anyone more dominant that Shaq was in 2000 and 2001. It's a shame that he didn't stay in great shape and he burned bridges with a few of the teams he was on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple of things:

- Our athletic director hiring an unproven head coach. 
- One of our greatest teams losing to a 15-seed in the first round. 
- A heartbreaking buzzer-beater in the tournament that becomes a signature play that's replayed quite a bit during each tournament. 
- Earning a reputation as the best school that's never made the Final Four.

Seriously, some of you are spoiled it's not even funny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't just a Reddit thing, but the whole idea of how an individual career can be judged alone by championships. A great example of this is the Kobe vs. LeBron debate and how the "52" talking point is brought up whenever LeBron's team loses in the final. 

Let's pretend we can switch careers and have LeBron James drafted by the Lakers to join Shaq and later on, Phil Jackson. I think we can safely say that LeBron would have won 5 rings too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree 100% with this. I love my Missouri Tigers, but college football is a lot more enjoyable when you don't have an emotional investment tied to it. When your team wins, your happiness overshadows the rest of the games. A bad loss (South Carolina last year) makes you hate football. 

On Missouri bye weeks, I can just sit back and enjoy football 12 hours.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the ending really makes Season 4 better than it was. I LOVED Lithgow's performance....one of the five best I've seen when it comes to TV shows. 

That said, there were a lot of wasted moments in that season. Some of the side plots could have been cut without it effecting the overall plot. Season 4 is third on my list behind the first two.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The biggest reason why Seasons 1 and 2 were my favorite was because it felt like each episode was important. No fat, not a lot of side plots and the side plots that did exist mattered to the story. Deb/Lundy's relationship, for instance, mattered because of who the BHB really was. 

It just felt every episode in those first two seasons mattered. Season 4 was very good and I enjoyed Seasons 5 and 7. 

But 1   2 were the best, with 2 edging out 1 for my favorite.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I had the power to make one change, I'd flip Season 2 to the end. Season 2 was what Season 8 should have been. You can't blame the writers for going with their best shot early on since it's no guarantee how long a show last, but Season 2 was the best season and the most tense season episode to episode.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Theory on Jim Carrey's "The Majestic" --- Peter was Luke all along </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-26 03:00:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This movie has been popping up on HBO a lot lately. It stars Jim Carrey and takes place shortly after World War II. 

Having watched it a few times this summer, I've developed a theory that Peter Appleton and Luke Trimble are one in the same. 

Evidence:

1. Early in the film, it's mentioned that Appleton attended college via the GI Bill. The GI Bill was available for those who also served on the homefront, but it connects the fact that both characters were in the military. 

2. Both characters had a connection to the movie industry. In Appleton's case, he was a writer in Hollywood. With Trimble, his family ran a movie threatre. If the Appleton/Trimble character suffered an injury during the war that resulted in a temporary loss in his memory, perhaps going to Hollywood and working on movies happened because of his childhood, similar to how the Pirates of the Sahara movie poster reminded the character of his life in Hollywood. 

3. There's a conversation between the doctor and Luke's dad during the town gathering scene about how Luke had been missing for years and years and lived another life. I thought this was hinting towards an ending revealing that Peter was Luke all along. However, I'll just use this as a hint regarding my theory. 

4. Luke's body was never found. Again, while I'm sure there were plenty of soldiers who were never recovered, this is an important basic fact in the theory. 

5. The whole town was convinced. A few townspeople had suspicions, but the fact that everyone bought into it gives this some credibility. 

6. Soldiers suffered from Dissociative Amnesia in real life and was first diagnosed following World War I. So, again, there is real life evidence backing up this theory. 

**TL;DR: Peter was actually Luke the entire time ---- and Peter was the life he had all the years he was missing.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, it's not the ending I had such an issue about. The final scene was a little strange, but whatever. 

The biggest issue I had was Season 8 as a whole. Too many new characters for a show in its final season. Bad writing. Bad script. Even worse continuity than the average TV show. You know, say like LaGuerta getting murdered and barely being mentioned?

The ending gets hated on quite a bit, but it was tolerable compared to the season's arc. We should have gotten Dexter vs. Deb in some type of manner. That's the only storyline that would have been somewhat fresh.  </TEXT>
