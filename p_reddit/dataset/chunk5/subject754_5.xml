	<TEXT> That sounds like a detroit locker. Both wheels have to spin at the same speed the diff carrier is, so both wheels have to spin constantly unlike a normal unlocked diff. Sometimes they can be a bit finnickey and I could definitely see it causing a spinout at high speeds

	<TEXT> Just remember this simple trick: spin the BB the way the pedals turn normally to loosen the BB, and turn the BB backwards of normal crank rotation to tighten it. 

And if you're worried about cross threading, just thread the BB backward until you hear a 'click' when the thread drops down off of the top of the bike's thread. That way the start (opening where the thread starts) of the BB and the start of the bike are in the same area. Screw it in nice and slow, and take it easy if you feel any resistance. Be sure to clean the bike's threads before reinstalling the BB too, nobody likes a dirty bottom (bracket)! </TEXT>

Also, that isn't either of our garages. I don't have a vice so we went a block over to another friend's house. He's the one planning a fiery tornado of biblical proportions. 

Also, it rides pretty well! Feels really slack, but it's a real fun bike to cruise around on. I was surprised when it felt very similar to my 6" travel bike </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know I ripped out my ex girlfriend's heart and threw it into a meat grinder. I knew there was something off in my head for a month or two, and it just came bubbling to the surface one night. My only regret was that I hadn't thought about what I was going to say. 

We were skyping and the call went from happy and "how was your day?" to "are you breaking up with me?" in the matter of 20 minutes. We met up in a parking lot, I fumbled around with unrehearsed words that made her cry, and then I left. 

There wasn't any specific big reason, just a lot of little things that finally add up. Trying to spout off all those reasons will just make you seem like a shallow asshole, but when asked "why are you doing this?", you need to answer with something...

It felt so shitty. She was such a nice person, and I couldn't bear to hurt her, but it was what had to happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ride [Shimano M530 SLX pedals](http://www.jensonusa.com/!3sbWP1lYrrVY8LnHv7sXVA!/Shimano-PD-M530-SLX-Trail-Clipless-Pedal?utm_source=FRGL utm_medium=organic gclid=CIjLmsr-7rYCFYMWMgodV30ALA). I like to ride really technical terrain, so I like that they have a wider foot platform on them. You don't need to clip in to get a reasonable amount of grip, so its easy to restart in a rock garden if you get stopped. Just rest your foot on the platform until you have enough time to clip in.

Hairdresser: "Oh wow, you're a senior? I would have never guessed, you look so young! Which colleges are you looking at?"

Me: "...Um actually I'm getting this haircut because I have 2 mechanical engineering job interviews this week. I'm almost done with college."
