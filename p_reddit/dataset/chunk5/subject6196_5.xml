	<TEXT> A few weeks ago I got paired up with the most talkative guy in the world. He was friendly, but he thought everything he said was the *funniest thing anyone had ever said*, and would stare at you to make sure you thought so too. He just talked, and talked, and talked, even while the rest of us were on the tee box over our ball.

Worse, we were grouped up with two women, and he kept making inappropriate comments. "I wish I could put a wig on and hit from those tees!" and "It's alright honey, it's a tough sport for the men too" and stuff like that. And after each such comment he'd laugh and say, "I get in trouble for saying stuff like that, glad you two aren't uptight!" But the women were obviously annoyed, and ended up quitting at the turn. 

Normally I would have broken away from the guy and let him play on, but there was a foursome ahead and behind us so I didn't have many options. And I'm the kind of guy who lets stuff like this bother me, so of course I had a shitty time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was at the driving range yesterday and a man comes rolling up holding onto one of those senior walkers. He's got just one club with him, a driver with an enormous head. Guy can barely walk.

He parks his walker, stumbles a few feet to the hitting mats, and tees up his ball. No practice swings or anything, just grips it and rips it. Form is obviously awful, all arms and hardly any follow through, but he's hitting them flush. One by one he drives them right down the middle, about 200 yards with some roll. Hits maybe two dozen, waddles back to his walker, and inches his way off the range. 

I wish I had gone over and high-fived him.  </TEXT>

There's value in opening up a roster spot, though. So it's really a balance of **A) Days Lost To DL** vs **B) Days Gains From Roster Spot**.

	<TEXT>   Barron v. Baltimore in 1833 held that the protections of the bill of rights did not apply to state governments.

Ehhh, Barron v Baltimore has been implicitly overruled:

 However, beginning in the early 20th century, the Supreme Court has used the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (interpreted, however, to have the same meaning as the 5th amendment) to apply most of the Bill of Rights to the states through the process and doctrine of selective incorporation. Therefore, as to most, but not all, provisions of the Bill of Rights, Barron and its progeny have been circumvented, if not actually overruled.

It hasn't been explicitly overruled, but it's not a valid precedent anymore and no modern judge would cite it in a ruling.  </TEXT>
