	<TITLE> 1 hour 5 bean chili </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-18 21:18:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is delicious, perfect for the chilly weather just around the corner! This stuff is good by itself, or in anything from chili mac to chili dogs, or as a delicious starter base for some chunky taco soup. All 5 beans are optional, take your pick on what you want.

Start with 5 cans of beans, rinsed (or make your own, that just takes a lot more time)

I usually use Northern Beans, black beans, red beans, kidney beans, and pinto beans, but you could also use black eyed peas, and I'm sure lentils wouldn't be bad either.

Brown 2 pounds of hamburger, variable on the fat content, it doesn't make a difference except in calories. Once the meat is browned, put it all in a crockpot and add the drained and rinsed beans, and 1 can of Rotel tomatoes and chilis.

 Use beef stock for the base, probably about 2 cups, maybe a little more maybe a little less depending on how thick you like it. I always say add a little more because you can fix the thickness a little later. 

Here is where the recipe falls into your hands. I don't measure my seasoning, so I can't tell you how much of anything to put in, but I season like this:

In order from the most used to least

Chili powder- about 1/4 cup, maybe more maybe less.

Garlic salt- this is a driving force in flavor, I want to say 2 tbsp.

Onion powder- 1  1/2 tbsp

Celery salt 1/2 tbsp

Cumin 1/2 tbsp

Cayenne pepper- this is your heat. Add as much or as little as you like.

Chili powder will be the dark color and rich flavor and the garlic gives it great taste, same with the onion powder. Be careful not to use too much cumin, I feel it overpowers the chili really easily. Celery salt is more to provide a small amount of flavor, you should barely notice it.

Once you season it, set it to high and leave it for an hour or a little more, just to get it hot and get the beans to absorb the flavor.

To finish it up, you just need to make sure the thickness is to your liking. If it is too runny for you, add corn starch a tsp at a time and mix until you get that full bodied thickness.

Serve with whatever you want. Jiffy corn bread if you don't have a lot of time!

Just at the last note, there are WAAAAY better ways to make chili. This is just a quick, easy, and flavorful way to make a good dish. If you have the time, make a nice slow cooker chili with lots of beans, different meats, and tons of time. Cheers, and good eating! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I start by farming white camps until im level 3ish. by then i can set up the harvesters which i usually do. After that, i kinda jump around and try to surprise enemies that are in a 1v1 situation with someone in the lanes or try to rescue teammates that may be caught in 2v1 situations, but that usually ends up with me dying as they fall waaaaay back and leave me hanging out to dry. besides that, just running through the jungle and harvesting.

I hate having to play as a tank with Khai because he just isnt durable enough until late game, by which point we are all focused on the last tower/core, but the team has 1 caster and 3 rangers, so im forced to be the primary hitter. Between that and nobody being able to take down a tower by themselves im stretched super thin on the map. </TEXT>

Besides that, playing as iggy and scorch is about the only caster I feel confident enough to solo with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you 100% .

Not defending BYU at all, because all rape cases should be investigated, but I think one reason they don't is because some girls have hooked up then regretted it and have told their bishops or the honor office they were raped or pressured into having sex instead of facing the consequences when in reality it was a consensual thing.

When this happens, it is understandable why the honor office might have trouble investigating sexual assault cases, but like I said, every one needs to be investigated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been 20 for the last 5 years at least. 

The way I look ato it, 10-15 percent means your service sucked.
18-20 service was good/ average.
21+ service was awesome or you have worked as a server before and know what's up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can say for sure that in the area of13th and 13th (East and South) there have been 4 or 5 houses on the market for at least 2 or 3 months. Perhaps this isnt reflective of the market in general, but I have observed the same thing in the avenues. I feel like demand has leveled off, but prices keep going up and that is what concerns me. Wages are pretty good here, but for anyone without a college degree you need at least a full time job and a half to pay for rent in most of Salt Lake County. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think one thing that is interesting is the current market state. There are loads of houses for sale and nobody is buying them. On a leisurely drive I think my wife and I see about 9 or 10 for sale signs that have been there for almost a month.

Between that and the current rent people are asking for in places like west jordan, it seems like the property may be a little over valued. I am worried air will be priced out of my apartment and that I won't be able to afford to live in Utah! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The one thing that has always been nice about Brazil is property price. I pay more for my one bedroom apartment than most families pay for their 3 or 4 bedroom house with a quintal. 

When the next election comes people will change, and you have a good couple of judges who prosecute corruption. The country will improve, it will just take time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As an American who lived in Brasil, I think you guys are or at least were close. I haven't been in country since 2014, but it didn't seem that bad when I was down there. I never feared for my life or property, I always felt safe, and the economy seemed to be improving. I know that since the price of oil has dropped, the country is scrambling to find a way to make money, and I think that at times all the import taxes kind of cripple the standard of living, but the country has so many economic resources that with the right management it should come right out of its recession.

Granted, electing politicians is the hardest part and the people will vote for who takes care of them, even if they are also stealing. You guys are close though! </TEXT>
