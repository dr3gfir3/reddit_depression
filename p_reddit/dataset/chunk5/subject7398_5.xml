Edit: Not here to bash OP. I understand everyone has their preferred way of dong things. We try and disclose all options and scenarios to our clients so they are prepared for the proper repair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is no potential damage to the engine as it was designed to be removed and installed this way. If the technician knows what they are doing it comes out and goes back in with ease. In my opinion there is more potential error doing the job without removing the engine. Also, the benefit of removing the engine means you can closely inspect everything else while the engine is out. It literally takes about 90 minutes to remove the engine. Leaving it in to perform engine work is senseless, as I stated before, Porsche engineered it to be done this way.

Edit: Champions don't take shortcuts

	<TEXT> It's not so much a mileage issue. More failures are due to long oil change intervals coupled with spirited driving. Here's a little more info: The zero-lash adjusters operate on a very small sliding clearance. The zero lash mechanism has a close enough fit that even when dry with no oil film at all the zero lash adjuster will hold air when squeezed together by the fingers.

If the any part of the valve lifter or valve assembly is hammered (damaged) this suggests the oil pressure to the lifters was insufficient and the zero lash adjusters were unable to keep the lash at zero or near zero and the cam lobe striking the lifter with some clearance acted in some ways like a hammer.

For the oil pressure to be insufficient doesn't require outright failure of the baffling. It may have been that some less than fully defoamed oil (oil with some residual air in it) was ingested by the pump and this aerated oil allowed the zero lash adjusters to partially collapse.

This defoamed oil can arise from too low an oil level, the wrong oil, or oil that is past its change by date. In this case the oil has become contaminated with combustion byproducts, unburned fuel and water to name two, and foams more readily because of it. There is a limit to how effective the defoam pots are and using the wrong oil or running the oil level too low or running oil for too long may deliver oil that exceeds the pots' ability to remove sufficient air from the oil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The mechanical part of the thermostat jams in the open position. In turn the thermostat cannot be controlled via the motor electronics. This causes the engine to take  longer to warm up. On cold days it may even run under normal full operating temp. 
I would go on and replace it. Better sooner than latet. BMWs don't like it when you wait to long to fix em. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bad front output shaft. Some techs call them CV axles. That binding you are feeling is the constant velocity joint binding in the output shaft. 

Second: 
The dealer should be giving you a copy of your repair order every time you have work performed to the vehicle. Have them print out the service history for the vehicle. 

Third:
It is a BMW. The ultimate driving machine that requires ultimate maintenance. It was made in Germany. When your parts are not in stock in the country it takes 5-7 days on average to get them to the dealer.

Sometimes giving good service is tough. I know finding it can even be harder. Hang in there. </TEXT>
