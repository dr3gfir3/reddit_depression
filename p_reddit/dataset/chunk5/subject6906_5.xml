	<TEXT> Accepting an unpaid internship and expected to work 40 hours a week is basically slave labor. Companies want free labor and put in as many hours as a full-time employee. The major drawback from this is benefits. The intern is NOT only unpaid, but works a full-time schedule without benefits. It's exploitation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They saved a ton food that was being thrown out....The tray move was to boost profit. Remember, if you have a meal plan you're paying well above what the food was bought for wholesale. Rutgers found a way to make more profit off the meal plan by minimizing the amount of food procured for the student population.  Therefore, they can charge just as much and go through less food. That's an increase in profit. Also, they found that the dishwashers used to clean the trays was another expense they could cut along with employees needed to clean the trays. Again, more profit.

Barchi is not a president. He's a politician, a coward and hired the train wreck Julie Hermann. Please take note. He failed big time with that move.  </TEXT>
