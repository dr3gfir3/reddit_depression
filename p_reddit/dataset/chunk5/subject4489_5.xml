	<TEXT> I'm not the type of person anyone would like. A skinny kid who always wears shirts and leggings that are twice the size he is, I'm not your average individual. I like to be alone, to be non-sociable, away from the noise, the chaos of the world. School isn't great either. No friends except for the occasional teacher who says hello. I've just gotten used to this way of life. 

As usual, 3:12 in the afternoon, I'm returning from school, coming back from the boring day of sitting in a classroom with no one I know. No homework today though, at least that's a plus. I walk towards the bike rack to grab my 2008 model. I worked hard to raise enough money to buy this beauty. It's been with me through thick and thin, never failed on me. After about 10 minutes of riding, I approached my home.... the orphanage. "FALLEN CREEK ORPHANAGE" was displayed on the archway of the gate that overlooked the entire estate. The name was given to the orphanage because it stood next to the creek that separated it from a mass graveyard of fallen townspeople that inhabited the place. I've been at the orphanage for just a year now. I used to be living with my Great Aunt, but she lost her battle to an unknown disease.

The orphanage stood tall as I approached. It was built in 1836 by the townspeople who lived here. Now their bodies rest in peace in the graveyard next door. I'm am not usually the type of person who gets frightened easily, but this orphanage does creep out every child that lives here. After I parked my bike to the rusty, broken, old bike stand that had no chains, I walked towards the entrance and proceeded through the looming metal door. The grumpy head mistress (who had the voice of a male) yelled at me as soon as I walked in. "Where the hell have you been?, you should have gotten here ages ago!" I told her that I was on time, but there was more traffic than usual(I lied). She bellowed at me some more and told me to head straight to the dorm room. I bet she can't go to sleep without yelling at someone per day! (I thought some more things about her but its better not to mention it here.) That's what I thought to myself as I made my way to the dorm room. There were other boys messing around when I got there. The boys had their own room and the girls had their own room. There were bunk beds lined up against the walls. I went to the restroom to clean myself up, and to get ready for dinner. 

I didn't have any real friends here, but I had one "acquaintance" who talked to me. He knew all sorts of secrets about this place. He explained why there were creepy photos of little children hung on the wall. They were the orphans that used to go here at the time the townspeople inhabited this area. The little children's' bodies were dug up in the basement of the orphanage and placed in the graveyard next door. My first few days living here were fine, but that's when I started hearing the voices. I couldn't go to sleep at night. Voices of little children laughing, crying, and scratching. One time, I heard someone playing a child's toy piano as well... we had no toys at the orphanage. I wasn't the only one hearing all of this either. The other boys claimed to hear them as well. When we asked the girls, they also heard sounds as well, like a mother crying, or a women singing, while a baby was crying. You're probably asking, Why don't you tell the people who work at the orphanage? well, we did. They called us all crazy-witted kids who had a hell of an imagination. There was no point. They didn't believe us.

When it is time for all of us to go to bed, the faculty turn off all the lights, and they leave back to their homes. (I think they're scared of this place too). The security go to a separate warehouse located outside the orphanage. The orphanage has a set of cameras that record everything that goes on. The warehouse is sort of like the control center where the security officers watch the camera footage. They basically leave us alone in this creepy old place. I even doubt that the security officers are watching crap, because They probably go into the stupid warehouse to drink alcohol and sleep; they won't have any idea of what's happening inside the orphanage. I'm trying to go to sleep just like all the other kids who try to ignore the noises that have been happening for the past year. It was strange, as soon as I arrived here, the kids say that the Creepy noises started. It was almost as if I was chosen to figure out why the ghosts of these children are haunting us...

Part 2 coming soon...
