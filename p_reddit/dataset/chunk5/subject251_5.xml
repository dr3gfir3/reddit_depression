	<TEXT> I think a fold is fine there. You're being results oriented as I think you're getting quartered a fairly large portion of the time - this is all player and read dependent too I suppose. One of the biggest leaks that PLO8 players have is playing the hi hand too fast with no lo or lo too fast w no hi.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you explain your setup a bit more?  Former hydraulic systems engineer here and would love to help.

So are you pedaling the bike to turn the pump, then the pump generates flow to turn the motor to the wheels?

The larger the motor you use, the slower it will turn.  You can calculate all the theoreticals of this.  You know the size of your pump and the speed at which it will spin, so you can calculate Q or your flow rate.  Take your flow rate and your motor displacement to calculate the RPM output of the motor.  You can also calculate the torque produced T = CIR * PSI / 75.36 to yield torque in ft*lbs.  

Hope that helps and wasn't talking down to you at all - I'm not sure how hydraulically inclined you are! </TEXT>

I don't think the bet on the turn accomplishes much other than exposing ourselves to c/r and bloating the pot when we know we probably aren't folding the NFD.

H2: flatting $27 is perfectly fine, and honestly probably optimal. 3b is bad as described villain is rarely opening worse. AP, its almost ALWAYS QQ+ but I think more heavily weighted to KK or AA. I don't see OMC just ripping it in w AK or JJ/TT/QQ.    </TEXT>
