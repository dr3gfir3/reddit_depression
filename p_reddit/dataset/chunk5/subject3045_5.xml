	<TEXT> Anyone else agree? There doesn't really seem to be much advertising or recognition for this movie...like at all. Also, the trailer was just released at the end of March, which is basically 2 and 1/2 months before its release (June 16th). I hope it doesn't bomb, since it's debuting the same day as Cars 3, and it also has to go against Captain Underpants and Transformers. 

Now as for the trailer itself, it looks interesting, but I don't know what to think of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, I'm referring to the animated movie. Hard to believe it's the same studio that's now making movies like The Boss Baby and Trolls. </TEXT>
