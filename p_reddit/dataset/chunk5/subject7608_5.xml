	<TEXT> It's not really funny, but kind of really is. I started going without a bra/panties because of my depression. I didn't have the energy to put into even doing the basics like getting fully dressed for classes. Once the depression lessened, I kind of had just gotten into the habit of not wearing them, so figured why start.  </TEXT>
