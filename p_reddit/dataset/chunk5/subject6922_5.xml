	<TEXT> My parents weren't well off when we were growing up and they made all of our presents. I still have lots of them and we always loved our presents so don't worry. They made us a toy castle, doll house, treehouse in the garden, toy swords, dressing up clothes - have a look on Pinterest for ideas too  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me and my mum made one for my cousin and loved it! Some ideas - carpet stores give away samples so use them for carpets. Also wallpaper samples but make sure you use a small pattern. Get hold of some paint tester pots if you want to paint things. We used fabric scraps for curtains and bedding. Oh and wooden blocks with details drawn on them (like jobs on top of an oven) for the kitchen (then it can be moved around and reorganised). I'll see if I have any photos but have fun!!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hama beads are also called peeler beads - toy shops still sell them and Amazon does too. If you want patterns look on Pinterest for cross stitch patterns. Also have a look for inspiration on Pinterest and etsy. I've made a few little zelda hearts, space invaders, Tetris pieces as magnets - they're really effective. Have fun!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a small heart balloon on my arm from the banksy piece "there is always hope". I have a big sun on my back as the sun always comes up no matter how shit everything seems (I had this a few months after a long difficult stay in hospital). And I have Rex from toy story on my leg with the quote "you've just got to believe in yourself". For me my tattoos are little messages to myself. They're eclectic but I love them and I have my next one planned for soon.  </TEXT>
