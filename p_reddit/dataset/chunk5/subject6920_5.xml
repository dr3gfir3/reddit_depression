	<TEXT> This is one of my issues. I haven't really decided one way or the other (go ahead and crucify me all you want), but I do believe that some scientists have an agenda, in both directions. And I do believe that you're much more likely to lose your funding as a researcher if you say you don't believe humans are causing climate change. My other issue is the models... They were inaccurate when an inconvenient truth came out, and lots of the claims from that movie haven't come true, even the ones they said would happen within ten years. So why would I believe them now? Not looking for a debate, just information. Just genuine observations from someone on the fence.  </TEXT>
