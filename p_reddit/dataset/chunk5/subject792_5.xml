	<TEXT> ha, so how much time, effort and money would it cost to put a 5 second piece of dialogue saying that he'll stay back with melisandre? or sansa? or anything? 


Wun wun was completely wasted in that battle anyway. Why was he only using his hands to smash shit up?! jeezus, they always use the budget thing on oversights or plot holes or the excuse when they simply don't care enough to make the effort. 

Nah, fuck it, we're making money and getting ratings. No one will care.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, Jon is to assume that Ramsay has no interest in saving the north from WW, instead of speaking to him to know for sure? He assumes the same from the Karstarks and the Umbers aswell? Despite them possibly not even knowing there is a threat? 

He hasn't made enough effort to avoid this. He knows full well that he needs as many men as possible, yet is willing to risk all of his men and his own life on an assumption or speculation.

	<TEXT> Jons perspective is not the same as ours, he doesn't fully know the politcal landscape, he doesn't really know what Ramsay is like. Why shouldn't he talk to him, by raven or messenger or in person? And the same for the Karstarks and Umbers. He knows how important these fighting men on both sides are, he hasn't done enough imo. 

Although i do completely agree that when he meets him on the field Jon will try and address some of this. I'm sure there will some attempt at negotation. But as he should know, the battle field is not the place to do it and it won't change the enivitable. If his plan was to assemble an army big enough to 'scare' Ramsay off in some way, the audience hasn't been made aware of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't remember exactly what happened with bran, just that he knew he went north. 

Might point still being tho, that he knows the long night is coming. After all the effort into getting the wildings beyond the wall, because they are needed, his plan is to march them against a much larger army? He is against impossible odds against the boltons, he said himself he hasn't got enough men. Why, when you haven't got enough to fight Ramsay, nevermind the bigger more important fight against the WW, would you even consider engaging them?  He is killing hundreds if not thousands of fighting men on both sides. 


Why not meet him? He went on his own to mance. Why not attack by skirmish or try to assassinate him? Why not even consider meeting with the bolton allies?


For me, its not made clear what Jons motivations are. I think they expect the audience to just go along with it because its jon snow and team stark, ignoring most of what has led Jon to this point and his own logic thus far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The lannisters and especially the freys killed half his family, yet he did nothing. Not only that, he went against the traditions, long held beliefs, duty of the starks and let the wildlings through the wall. He let his half brother (known heir to winterfell?) go off north of the wall. So only now family is important?  (And also sansa is safe there with him atm anyway.)


But mainly, there are other ways than marching the army, that Jon betrayed his family name/the north/the nightswatch for (the army that Jon is so certain is needed to fight the WW) against yet more northern men that jon needs in the battles to come.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sticking with the show.


 Jon was so certain that he needs men to fight the white walkers, he did something unthinkable for a northerner. Making peace with the wildings, letting them through the wall was such a huge deal for a Stark and the north, never mind the nightswatch. He did it because he needed the men yes? So why is he even fighting Ramsay? A battle that will massively dwindle 'his own' forces and the Bolton alliance. Its not just Boltons hes fighting remember. 



Really his beef is with Ramsay and him alone. I imagine he will call him out on the battlefield for a 1v1, but obviously, that will not work. Basically what i'm wondering is if the show has addressed this. Did i miss something? I know he was glum for a few episodes but i can't remembering him protesting massively at sansas revenge mode. 

**Everything he's done so far, all the sacrifices he's made, by his own logic, he should not be fighting this battle.** In fact he should be doing everything he possibly can to stop it. He doesn't need to make peace with Ramsay, he just need to speak with him. He needs his men. The boltons are wardens of the north now, Jon doesn't really know enough about Ramsay to think he will completely abandon his duty to that title. But more importantly, he's done nothing to try and convince the karstarks and the umbers to stand down, join him, send men north. Anything to stop more northerners dying. 



Its not that i don't want him to fight for winterfell, for the starks. Its just he's had so many chances to do that before. He hasn't because he knows there's bigger fish to fry. Why he's decided to go along with this hasn't been made clear enough imo. In the grand scheme of things, he absolutely should be against this battle. It doesn't need to happen, and will leave the north a whole lot weaker.

	<TEXT> Walder used the broken promise as an excuse rather than it being the cause. He secured more men and lands by betraying the starks and won the favour of the crown. However, like many of the things in the show, you have to assume that either he doesn't know yet or something has happened off screen.

All the investment in each of the characters i once loved has been completely undone by the constant bullshittery from D D. This show is lost 2.0. 


But because of this, i am free. Free to not give shit if LF fucks them all over and jon dies and ghost dies and arya dies and davos dies and then littlefinger dies and then ramsay dies from tripping over a dogs bone off screen. I hope drogon plummets into the ocean with dany onboard. I don't care anymore. Meaningless shock value means i'm not shocked by anything anymore. And worse, i simply don't care enough to be shocked.

I've had it in mind that she MUST be plotting something, because shes basically done fuck all about anything so far. But still, nothing. The HS is owning the show. She doesn't even see Tommen anymore. She gets wrecked by Olenna. Is fine with sending Jaime away. Just whats going on?

	<TEXT> I was going to write a post on this very subject as no ome else seems to have mentioned it? I thought about Kevan too, as in the show its easy to see the HS going for hand of the king. However, i'm not sure what 'sins 'he's carried out, that the audience know of anyway. Also, i think he's somehow aligned himself witht he faith too, or at least is putting up no fight. In the last episode, he did and said nothing at all, despite the big reveal. 


However, i'm going for Qyburn. He's done a hell of a lot that the faith would not like. And i'm sure Pycelle, who seems to be in favour of the faith, would have told them enough. This would also be the catalyst for cersei, via Robert Strong, to go and crack some skulls.  </TEXT>

Halsey, Banks, Sara Hartman, Kyla, Emma Louise, Oh wonder, Shura, Isabel, Mura Masa, Sunday, Chelsea Lankes, even acts like Mo or Alessia Cara or Vaults. Theres so many i forget most of them, a few big ones i can't think of right now.

	<TEXT> Totally agree and have thought it for while, even tho its an unpopular opinion for some reason. I will add that i think marg is quite capable of killing Tommen now. He did nothing to stop her imprisonment. Her time in the cell would have made a mark on an already ruthlss social climber. 


ALSO, i think she will announce she is pregnant first. That way her and her family are safe for a long time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As titled. The only issue i have with him is his need to poke fun at his weight. Everything else is understandable. He's just turned up with some slag from a people who his dad has waged war against for years. 


And more so Sam is a dick if he expects anything less. He himself hated wildings. He himself would have never believed in whites or giants or anything like that, so why would he? It annoyed me he didn't explain himself. All he needed to do was to tell them everything that happened to him, from craster to stannis to hardhome. (i know its done like that in the show for that very effect on the audience, but still) He should be convincing his dad in order to have more support for Jon.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-05-30 17:55:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Straight to it. **Queen marg has not converted. She is fully aware of what she doing and is playing a long game to ensure she stays queen, by eventually killing Tommen.**


She's wasn't in a good position. Her king is easily manipulated, hasn't the will or the balls to stand up to anyone. Along with her brother she was locked away in her own city by a bunch of fanatics. Led by a very cunning man, that to a certain extent has sweet talked the king for his own ends. Not much to work with.. However, what she has got is influence over the king, and the affection of the smallfolk.. 


 The scene with Tommen is everything we need to know. Marg wasn't exactly convincing in showing Tommen any affection after not seeing him for so long, but it was enough to show him he's missed.  The line **"He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?"** in reference to the HS is such a loaded statement. Theres a huge amount of malice coming from her, almost saying it through gritted teeth. But also i think she was testing the waters, to see how she needs to continue on the conversation.  Convincing Tommen to align with the faith was really her only option left. By doing that, in theory, she is safe from anymore ill treatment from the HS. Her family are safe from damaging their position. The Lannisters are all but spent. And, she still has the love and support of the masses. With this, she has everything she needs to rule.



**But she still can't trust Tommen.** He is too young, vulnerable, prone to manipulation. He did nothing to stop her imprisonment, to protect her, even tho he had the power to do so. 


She is fully aware the HS is in this for his own ends. I'm not sure exactly how this coming together will change things, but i imagine he will sit on the council and possibly come to replace the hand? Either way he's trouble, considering how easily influenced Tommen is and with his hold over the smallfolk. 

However, even with the situation as it stands, she could potentially rule all on her own. Two things remain. Get pregnant, if not already done. And then get rid of Tommen. I think she'll be the one that kills Tommen. She is that ruthless.  And with that, she is queen with a baby on the way. The Lannisters are all but gone and she has devoted followers all around her. She has shown time and again how she only cares about being queen. Her scenes with cersei shows how nasty she can be. Olenna plotted to kill Joff, so why not kill Tommen too?



*My only niggles. I don't think for a minute the HS believes marg has turned. He could potentially reveal to Tommen that the tyrells killed Joff if needs be. But for now she is too powerful via the tyrell army and support of the smallfolk to mess too much with. Kevan didn't seem to have a word to say about this move. Whether he's in on it or just has the bigger picture in mind, i don't know.  
Also cersei. She must be planning something, i just don't know what.

	<TEXT> Yes absolutely. I think on the show they have stayed away from her mad side until shes finally on her way to westeros, and then the confliction will begin. 

I know its an obvious thing to say, but without her dragons i think the audience would be completely against her. The empathy the audience has with the dragons, esp drogon, automatically puts us with her. But shes a very confused character. Shes been manipulated throughout her whole life. The only 'truth' about her is her targ routes and her dragons. But that enevitably means death and destruction, and this time as a conquerer. 


I think the show will begin to explore that more and more. Particularly when her dragons incinerate hundreds of people in one sitting.

	<DATE> 2016-05-24 18:53:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll keep it simple. Bran is important not because of his 'time travel' abilities, or the fact he is a stark, but because of his warging abilities in general. 

Personally, i don't think he has the ability to jump back through time at will, he only went where bloodraven showed him to go (and i think that was only where Bloodraven had been or seen himself?). And he only did that to get bran to where he needed to be. I think (and hope in the show) that it will be revealed why and how bloodraven came to be. But his purpose, whether originally so or by discovery, was to find the most powerful greenseer and 'teach' him. 

The CtoF need Bran because they think he can become, or already is, powerful enough to go against the night king and stop the whites. 


At this point i think its important to say that i think  **the night king doesn't 'raise the dead'. He wargs the dead.** 

This probs isn't a massive shock to lots of people, but i think its a key difference. They are not zombies, they are being controlled. And Bran can control them in the same way. 


Bran has been told he can be the most powerful greenseer ever. But no one has told him yet what he actually has to do with these powers.  I believe (or at least i think the CotF believe) he can stop the night king, by himself warging the dead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Choice is not an illusion, it is very real. Its when you combine choice with the idea of free will that you get a contradiction. 


How do you come to the conclusion that the actions of the characters are meaningless? I would say exactly the opposite. The entirety of actions by individual characters is meaningful, and only that. What i mean by that is they themselves are the sum of their actions, its not meaningless causality. Its beautiful causality. Look at the world that causality has created. 


You can simplify it throughout the world of asoiaf, through lineage, through catastrophe, through revenge or redemption. **Its casual determinism that drives the world forwards.**


 HOWEVER. GRRM has introduced  a 'true act of god'. Of which i mean, a complete unkown, unknowable event. That red comet. And subsequently **daenerys**. She is the the idea of free will in this world grrm has created. She is the unknown. Beyond the reaches of the weirwoods. I think she will become more and more important for what she is as the story progresses.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Determinism or causal determinism is the way any world works tho. (Except, in GRRMS world at least, for one particular thing.) Those characters 'failed' because of the choices they made, even if their choices were always going to go a certain way. Its 'always going to happen' becuase of their choices, not the other round, if thats makes sense...

It only cheapens the story if we have a gods eye view of things, which so far we've had only because of bloodraven. Now he's gone, in theory, everything is new. We are at the forefront of causality with bran. Everything is predetermined, yes, but everything for us is still unknown. As far as we and bran are concerned he can still change anything and everything. </TEXT>
