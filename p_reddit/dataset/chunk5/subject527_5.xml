	<TEXT> 1) Thank you. My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years now and he has helped me through EVERYTHING that has come my way. He is my biggest motivator because I just want to be healthy and live a long life with him. 
2) I did 6 weeks of liquid diet in preparation for the surgery (that was so hard because of the sugar) but I lost between 5-7 kg I think. Basically the doctors just wanted to see that I was determined enough to stick with liquid only in order for them to believe the surgery would work.
3) Eating now is so beyond different. I can only eat about a cup of food at a time depending on how heavy it is. If you imagine a single portion yoghurt tub I can only finish one of those. 
4) I try to work out about 5-6 times a week. Depending on my schedule. I do little things when I am on my days off like washing clothes and vacuuming the house. Little things add up. I like to walk, run and anything that involves being outside. 
5) In preparation for the surgery I had to have counselling in order to work through some previous trauma that my doctor thought my inhibit my success but now that i have lost so much weight my state of mind is completely different. I still have down moments like everyone else but I am able to control my emotions so much more now. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and mega-depression (plus a few others that i can't remember) but just by working every day to be a happier person I am getting there. </TEXT>
