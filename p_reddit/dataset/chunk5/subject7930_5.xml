	<TEXT> "The problem was it goes on really great and it looks really great, but its really hard to get off. They came up with this idea: they stick me in a sauna at the end of the day. They literally have to melt it off of me. That was the thing, because during the test we found out its so abrasive they literally have to scrub it off of me. So after two days, my skin was like hamburger. So they came up with the sauna thing, and I literally have a portable sauna that travels around with me and I get in at the end of the day, and I get three guys who come in and attack me  nothing weird there. Four guys in a sauna, just being men. We talk about football and fighting a lot while were in there." -Bautista </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dammit victor. We're talking about movies! Why'd you have to go and bring up Torchy's? My mouth immediately started watering and now I'm gonna have painful cravings for the next 5 months until I go back to Texas.

Edit: also, I saw The Nice Guys at an Alamo Drafthouse and they played footage of Ryan Gosling as a kid dancing and acting and goofing etc. Only deepened my hatred for his undeniable likability and charisma.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit. You have to click this link.

The movie of King Kong is an elaborate allegory of spiritual evolution so we can understand the mythical quality of this story which also underlies the Lord of the Rings, the Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Cupid and Psyche and Sleeping Beauty.

We understand from King Kong what ancient symbols have been telling us of the hundred percent split nature of humanity and the necessity for purification, integration  and going higher through meditation.

Ancient knowledge of Splitness, the universal split nature of humanity through DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)  and MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder)  shown and proved by the 10,000 year old images of the split animal-human or ego-soul of the Centaur, Sphinx, Minotaur and Phoenix.

Or Anne Darrow-King Kong or Gollum-Frodo or Cupid-Psyche or Beauty-Beast or Sleeping Beauty-Prince or Cervantes Sancho Panza-Don Quixote and Frodo-Sam. </TEXT>
