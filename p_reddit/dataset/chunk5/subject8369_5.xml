	<TEXT> IIRC progressives misjudged the situation and helped get a fascist elected... 

Hilary was boring, status quo, and establishment-backed, and Bernie got fucked by the DNC...

But there was a time to down the pitch forks and get people excited for Hilary, and not because Trump was a sexually assaulting (per his own description and victim accounts), peeping tom (walking through Teen USA pageant changing rooms per his own account), race baiting (Mexicans are rapist)... but because he posed a material threat to the democratic institutions and financial well-being of the country.  

The progressives misjudged the mood of the country, they thought their time was here and missed the part that we were in a life and death struggle for the future and well-being of our nation.

Clinton's home server, speaches to wall street, trumped up Ben ghazi hearings...
Vs Russian connections, speeches to wall street, shady business practices, opaque conflicts of interests, no release of tax returns, appointins bankers and military industrial compex and oil interests to the cabinet, etc... 

not to mention unhinged tweeting, clearly playing favorites with anyone who helped him get elected from trumpeting LL bean, to firing the long time inauguration announcer for someone who backed him, etc.

Nothing is too small or petty for him... he got rid of the guy who announces the innaguration http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charlie-brotman-inauguration-announcer-fired_us_58751638e4b099cdb0ffa92e for someone who backed him...

Demanding lists of people who worked on climate change and other causes, his advisor calling on CNN to clean hosue and fire unfriendly reporters...

Hilary sounds down right exciting at this point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump is scary because of the whole uninformed, thin-skinned, unpredictable, ungrounded thing, narcassist, cronyism...

Pence is scary because the whole incredibly right wing, cut down the safety net, conversion therapy for gays, take America back to 1950 thing...

Pick your poison? I think the thing we can hope for is Trump campaign did actually collude with Russia and Pence and Trump both knew about it... so both get impeached... 

...but then we get pseudo-wonk and ayn rand aficianado (a common sign of stilted intellectual development past high school) Paul Ryan who wants to cut medicare to  a fixed grant system and privtize it along with social security....

So in the end, I don't know where things land will be better? Except maybe if Trump goes it will spare us the globally destabilizing tweets?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk, I think the interchangeability of swear words like crud, crap, shit is relatively new,  and our generation is definitely less sensitive to it as a whole. But I think the loss of delineation of severity does strip nuance from the language and limits expression. It's nice having grades of bull shit. 

It's nice to be able to say you did a crap job or that's crap to someone who is doing a mediocre job or is producing a mediocre falsehood and but then have the lexicon to tell someone they did a shit job or their claim is shit if they are really underperforming or deliver a real whopper...

The loss of power from words that used to have strong meaning from swearing to the flagrant  overuse of words like love has hurt the tools we have to communicate and express our emotions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um, this was not a classic military ship, it was a spy ship made to look like a freighter, they on purpose were meant to look like diminutive in inconspicuous vessels. This is not a destroyer brimming with guns and missles.  

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/USS_Liberty_%28AGTR-5%29.jpg/450px-USS_Liberty_%28AGTR-5%29.jpg

From the cockpit of a mirage jet or a fast attack boat it is hard to tell whose ship it is. The Egyptian navy at the time while not a blue water navy had destroyer and missile boats and was not some run down endeavor. Moreover, the Israeli navy at the time was reall y primitive and in its infancy, attention was on the airforce and ground forces.

To suggest it was an act of intentional aggression against US naval forces is not borne out by investigations or make sense for Israeli national interest. 

edit:
this is what israel thought it was attacking, single funnel, single mast destroyer of the egyptian navy:

And were attacking with this:

and this:
http://img1.yourmiddleeast.com/media/news/images/2013/photo_1370432919513-1-0_s660x390.jpg

Not hard to see why they messed up. It is not like they had sophisticated radar or communication gear. They had no real anti capital ship capability... clearly poorly thought and not premediated, just trying to pre-empt further attacks on Israeli positions.

Honestly, people don't get how much their healthcare costs. Medicare recipients who argued they paid into the system so they deserve care mostly paid only 1/3 of the actual cost of their care. 

We need to stop seeing healthcare as a business or something earned. It's a way of helping people lead productive lives. It means helping elders be healthier and more independent, people with mental illness to cope and function, people with chronic diseases to cope and function, average Americans to be healthier and more productive... etc.

It's like roads, transport, etc... it's a part of the framework that allows a modern society and economy function. We are the only western advanced democracy that approaches health care as a private not public good. </TEXT>

Resisted calls to investigate concerns Russia hacked the dnc to selectively leak information to affect the election. Refuses to release his tax returns... lots of smoke... reasonable cause for further investigation.

You compared that to pizza gate.. where podesta discusses pizza in an email and then anon misconstrued some completely innocent pictures into a child trafficking conspiracy that was just a rehashed updated version of 90s spirit cooking allegations...

Do you not get false equivalency? I don't care what your political affiliation, it more suggests hyperbole at best, deflection at worst or an inability to compare and evaluate the authenticity and evidence behind allegations...

Skepticism is good...   blindly lumping everything as false crock or shit is not helpful. We need to trust some information to inform our decisions, otherwise it's a fact free world. Might as well flip a quarter for every decision.

	<TEXT> The dossier is likely false, the CNN article, judging by his teams strategy to deflect is likely true, and it would be interesting to see how they believe they might have tried to compromise him. But more importantly, without his tax filing we have not way to know Russia's and other foreign powers fiscal ties with the Trumps organization... really that is what is needed and likely why he won't release his tax filings like every other modern president. 

To suggest that this is comparable to some random anon members generating a conspiracy because podesta once ordered some cheese pizza and claiming his order pizza meant he was running a child trafficking ring scandal... well that is disingenuous false equivalency not far removed from the performance from Kelly Anne that the OP posted above.

This attack on truth and investigation is part of the problem. Information comes in grades of legitimacy, pizza gate is at the bottom, buzz feed dossier just above that, and some ways up above that, actually quite a ways up, is the CNN report... 

And no one is accusing trump of specific transgressions, there are calls for further investigation of foreign attempts to influence the election... not exactly comparable to pizza gate.

	<TEXT> Trump's administration goes after the press, calling for culls of reporters, demanding fluff pieces, demanding impossible journalistic standards, lying and decrying use of anonymous sources...

Basically, she is calling for a dismantling of the 4th estate and any opposition press. 

That is chilling. With Trump's Twitter and YouTube channels his administration has direct, uncontested, daily, and instant access to the public. With a chief advisor who is the former editor of breitbart they have a friendly news organization that has an ~~alt righ~~ fascist agenda... This all adds up to an attack on the foundation of democracy by eroding any levers or accountability. 

At at time when Trump's party has control of both the executive and the legislative branches, the need for an independent and robust media is vital, especially as the judiciary is at risk in the common years as well... otherwise who is left to hold Trump and company to account?

By their standards deep throat could not have happened, the pentagon papers shouldn't have been published, none of the wiki leaks stuff they so heavily used in their campaign should admissible, etc... they want total control...

Furthermore, they seem to have no problems with lying themselves, conflating the truth and doing all the things they falsely accuse the press of... they are now the elected government... it's far worse when they do than some blog news site.

All of Trump's demonstrably wrong tweets... are those lies or mistakes? Why don't they fire him? They are straight up gas lighting us right now. The ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda is being birthed in front us on TV.

If people though Cheney and then build up got the Iraq war, the silencing of ambassador Wilson and outing Plame, etc was peak disingenuousness for the Bush administration... Trumps administration, I think, is going to make that look like child's play. </TEXT>

Basically she is calling for a dismantling of the 4th estate and any opposition press. That is chilling.


With trump's Twitter and YouTube channels and direct access to the public, and assault on the press, a chief advisor who is the former editor of breitbart and hence basically a friendly news organization... it's an attack on the foundation of democracy.

She also attacks press popoularity ratings, conflates reports, refuses to address specifics, and just goes after any opposition press. It's terrifying.

She complained that when obama was elected the press focused on superficial things like the noble prize... trump didn't win a noble prize and obama was not appointing people with Russia ties to the cabinet at a time of concern when Russia was trying to influence US elections. 

It's like they don't understand that the press' job is to report events... not to to ensure the president has a good image? </TEXT>

But the problem is public opinion goes and cycles and after agressive progress on many issues like gay marriage rural voters are feeling like their needs aren't a focus. And regardless of the merit to their feelings, when Trump promises them the world, dems need need to counter that. 

The aggressive roll back of healthcare and govenment programs that is going to happen is going to far more harmful to vulnerable marginalised minorities than many other groups. 

Furthermore, if minorities and young people want a say things, they need to more aggressively turn out to the polls. 

So it sucks, it feels wrong, but if income inequality and social safety nets are not improved then margenalized minorities are going to be the canaries in the coal mine for all working and middle class workers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The free market is only concerned with balancing supply and demand today. That is the input and output. It does not care if the company is there 1 year later, 10 years later etc. 

Its why it can't factor in global warming, the cost of global warming is not reflected in the cost of fossil fuels because the price is paid in the future collectively. 

Economists agree on this. Growth has happened because free markets efficiently allocate resources, the population grows, we consume more, creates long term growth... but its does not have to, it just has so far. Companies following free market principles look to short term growth and earnings reports.

Its why westen companies build factories in China knowing their IP will be stolen and chinese will build knock offs because in the next 5 years they will turn a profit. 

It is why government builds roads, funds  basic science, funds the military, etc... the highway system generated the opportunity for auto markets, for goods transport, etc. Government airports allow for air travel. Free markets don't care if everyone has access to roads, or to education or healthcare. 

A free market solution to healthcare would be to let poor people die. A free market solution to roads would be if you cannot afford to pay for road use you would be unable to get around. A free market solution to education would be people would only get what their parents could afford. A free market approach to the environment would be people could pollute where ever as long as the goods they produced were purchased.

	<TEXT> I do not get how markets apply to a public good. A school produces two products, education and educated students. The customers are the students themselves and society. Free markets break down when the consumer-producer relationship is indirect. Furthermore, for poor students, its not like they have the resources or options to shop around anymore than you have time shop prices for hospitals when you having a heart attack or price out local fire departments when your house is burning. 

Furthermore, society benefits if everyone gets a good education, and the students cannot pay, so if their parents are poor, they currently get a terrible education. This further worsens income inequality and costly cycles of crime and poverty. Private schools already do this, they focus on good students, cut struggling or problem ones, help the wealthier students with educated parents, not deal with the rest. 

Except the problem students are the ones that are going to be very costly to society if not educated to some basic level of auntonomy. And we can blame parents, but when they break into your house, well no one is putting their parents in jail. 

The proposal would be to have publicly funded schools, with competitive teaching salaries, which would also reflect the demand on that skill set... stem, programming etc would get paid better because other sectors want those workers than music or art. 

But giving over education to companies does not work because their incentives are to cut costs and short-run profits, not long-term student quality, equal edcuation, or helping struggling stidents. 

In any case, performance-based pay, incentives to work in shitier schools disticts, professional acountability will create competition for those jobs, creating a competive labor market. 

We see this in places with good education systems like in Finland or South Korea. Well paid, highly professional teachers, with competitive salaries and benefits. 

Free markets are a tool. In the short run they help balance resources and assign costs. They are less good for situatiuons were long term value is needed and were there are negative externalities where cost is not factored into the pricing. 

So cutting education costs can save money now, but later the work force will suffer for lack of candidates and crime will go up etc... but the market does not factor in that later cost. 

The internet, btw, is not fully privatized, its run on a government backbone and is still goverened by the US rules (net neutrality). Fully removed of controls you would get throttling of specific domains based on the relationship of you ISP and the content provider. Furthermore, the internet is not a fundamental public good, like healthcare or education.

	<TEXT> Well, the problem is that at the wage that they are paid, and the shit they have to deal with, it does not attract top talent... which is a problem.

Education is complex because teachers were historically paid less in America because it was traditionally a woman's job. This tradition was left over from the one room school houses of the American fronteir. Because it was one of the few avenues for women to work it meant that they got very qualified and talented candidates at a low cost.

Since women entered the rest of the labor market they now compete with private sector salaries and the salaries teachers are paid do not attract top talent. 

So they system is screwed from 2 sides. 

* Dem supported teachers unions using tenure to protect shitty teachers, make it hard for talented new teachers, and prevent accountability. 
* Republicans pushing to cut salaries, defund the system, and sell the system out to private corportations from running the school to making the testing.

Also 3 additional issues:

* Constant anti-intellectual movements to cut science from schools and push religous/ political agendas (banning evoloution, texas getting rid of jefferson from their textbooks because he was to liberal etc.)
* Overemphasis on sports and sports teams, huge funding for highschool football, cutlure of worshiping the sports teams, anti-intellectual spirit
* Toxic, material driven, environment of public schools, made even more toxic by social media. Literally its seems like everything other than education is of import in the schools.

What needs to happen is teachers need to be paid more, receive performance pay, increased bonuses for working in shittier areas, but also increased acountabiltiy, training, accreditation just like other professionals.

We need to commit to as a country guranteeing as solid education to all of our citizens. A undertrained illetrate popoulation will struggle competing in a global marketplace, is a risk to our national security (worse candidates for the military), and makes for uniformed voters.

As to privatizing public goods? when has that gone well? becauase health insurance compaines, for profit health care, for profit prisons, or mercenaries have worked out so well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That the point isn't it? What separates us from him is rule of law and due process. Due process is about assessing if someone committed an act and the proportional punishment. 

So even if it is clear that he had committed the crime, it has to be shown he had the capacity to understand that he was committing a crime and then to ascertain the appropriate punishment. 

Without that process it is just murder or violation of someone rights and freedoms... furthermore, having the accused stand trial is a way to hold someone responsible for their action and assigning responsibility. 

It is as much for society, the victims and their families as it is for the punishment and sentencing. 

It is a way of establishing that what he did was wrong and will not be tolerated in a systematic way... makes it harder to then later spin and craft narratives.

Take Nuremburg post WWII, it is helpful because it held what was left of the Nazi leadership accountable for their role. It is instructive because they did not deny their actions, just minimized their collective roles or stated they were following orders. 

But the trial documented the evidence against, the charges, the witness testimony and their defense so posterity can have this as a record of their crimes and guilt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isn't like we are still paying for the bush years with things like the cost of the iraq war, the bush tax cuts and the 2008 collapse not to mention 8 years of republican obstructionism. Now they republicans have all three chambers. People who graduated college 2008/9 will have lifelong lower earnings because of that crash and likely missed out on opportunities. Also many redditors are in science, medicine, academia, social workers, teachers etc and worry about resources to serving their clients and scientific progress being cut. These are real concerns... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, that too, but its a harder push, we need at least one lever on the federal level. But state legislatures are a must, i just don't see much movement on that in 2 years either... its all desperate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the dems failed to make a case to the bulk of american voters why trump and the republicans are a threat to their well-being. 

But if your father and grandmother voted dem except for trump, then that is irrational because he stands against most democratic issues and with a republican congress will have the chance to implement those polices. 

I think you need to do some soul searching why they voted against hilary... either they bought into the crooked hilary message, didnt care for a woman in office, or just did not like her. But voting Trump and then dem down ballot seems not well thought out.

If they care about medicare, social security, income inequality, minimum wage, and other stalwart dem platforms, then I don't understand where trump fit that narrative. 

People can be wrong, and your father and grandmother and another slightly less than 50 million voters were largely wrong. It is hard to see the merit in the argument of side that argues against scientific consensus or economic theory and dismisses educated opinion as liberal propaganda. One side tries an evidence based approach, Trump just shoots his mouth off. </TEXT>

They are an outlier... unfortunately a huge outlier in population size:

	<TEXT> Well, foreign aid, modernish medicine, decreased mortality rate... particularly child mortality. If fertility stays the same population grows rapidly... problem is even in more successful African states like nigeria large families are a religious and cultural thing so there is no drop off in fertility like happened is the West, Asia, and even catholic Latin America. Also, income inequality and subjugation of women doesn't help. Nigeria is projected to be 400 million by 2050 and 800 by 2100. 

But what you point out will happen, and the problem is when the continent collapses into starvation, war etc. (more than now), and the 1 billion refugees flee north to Europe... what will happen? 

So to avoid that, Europe needs to invest a bit more in African family planning, income inequality, and women empowerment programs... or start building the wall's and coast guard navies/ steal themselves to watching a 100s of millions starve.

	<TEXT> Again, if you had to guess a probability, what is the chance that her generator will see use for that purpose in the next decade... remembering that pertol motors don't like to sit idle for decades, so it will require periodic cleaning and maintenance if not used, otherwise its useless. You also need to store fuel and it takes up space.

What is the utility and return on that investment of $2000+, factoring in lost interest etc... not to mention installation, maintenance etc. 

It is not a rational choice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cost of damage x probability of event = likely damage.
Cost in lost utiltiy and inconvenience for prolonged outage x miniscule probability = tiny amount

$2000than project risk/ cost. Therefore, the decision is irrational. She would be better off putting that $2000 in say insurance from flooding, or wind or fire depending on her local weather, or etc...

Now if power outages are an issue in her area, then a generator makes sense for other reasons. 

It has never happened and it would be still extraordinarily unlikely that her specific area would be affected if it did happen, and it is not clear how much control one can exert on americans outdated power grid from modification of code through internet delivered malware ... Although stuxnet did show it to be possible to cause damage in that way, its not clear that its reproducible with the US grid or the russians have that capability. Furthermore, severe weather is far likelier to cause a prolonged outage.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, what is likelier, Russian cyber attack on grid (theoretical risk) vs wind taking down a power line? If she didn't buy it because of weather and other more common power grid threats... why by one now? It's not a rational response. The article even had it been true would have in no way meaningfully increase her risk of losing power day to day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't disagree that we are not at end times, and rejected that rhetoric during the came, but Trumps cabinet and policy proposals pose a real threat to the well-being of many American citizens. 

The other issue is that American has repeatedly failed to make the substantial and meaningful structural changes to its economy necessary to address long term major challenges like climate change, income inequality, health care costs and health care disparities. 

These will catch up with us, and while Hilary likely offered treading water, Trump carries the risk of sinking the ship. The trillions lost on Iraq and to Bush tax cuts continue to haunt our fiscal policy and foreign policy to this day. It is naive to believe that Trump, with republicans in control of the executive, the legislative and soon judicial branches will be unable to do irrevocable harm to the nation.

Furthermore, there is concern regarding trumps fitness to be president. He is unprecedented on many levels and this creates uncertainty that is worrying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only problem is they organize there, get emboldened and spill across other subs. 

There is this thought that ignorance and bigotry will melt when they are brough into the sunlight. However, if there is enough of it that comes out at once, in can snowball flattening all its path. 

The internet gave the alt right and fascist right a space to organize and find kindred spirits... republican dog whistles got them a footing in poltiics under the cover of anti-pc, and then trump main streamed them...

Their enthiasem and vitriol can make reddit unusable as they poison other subs.  </TEXT>
