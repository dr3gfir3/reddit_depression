	<DATE> 2016-07-09 06:08:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My father told me this when I was young. He grew up on a farm back in the 40's and 50's and for the longest time they had an outhouse that was their primary bathroom. One night he was sitting in there taking a crap when he hears a voice coming from below him. It was saying very quietly "If the log rolls over, we will die". He is sitting their puzzled but he keeps hearing it over and over again "If The Log Rolls Over We Will Die"...

Now he starts to freak out so he wipes himself and runs inside and grabs the flashlight off the counter and comes back out to check it out. Only now, it is louder and more frantic **If The Log Rolls Over We Will Die.**

He crept up to the toilet hole, turned on the flashlight and slowly peered over the edge of the toilet and what he saw scared the hell out of him...

It was a bunch of ants sitting on a turd and chanting **If The Log Rolls Over We Will Die** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was in college (This was back in 1986), I had a friend from High School visit for the weekend to hit some dorm parties. Remember, this was when the drinking age was 18.  He got absolutely shit faced and passed out on my sofa. Me being the great friend I am, I pulled out my indelible magic marker and drew all over his face, chest and arm...and then went to bed.

Sometime early in the morning he woke up and stumbled off to use the dorms bathroom (Open bay bathroom and showers). From my room down the hall I suddenly hear a monstrous scream of "WHAT THE FUCK".  Then he came back down to my room and passed out. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Making larger monthly mortgage payments than required. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-01 11:24:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm about to start a new job where my pay is increasing by about 25% and I want to make larger monthly mortgage payments.  But I've run into an issue.  Why is it that if I want to increase my mortgage payment every month to pay off the mortgage earlier, the bank calls and sends a letter or email that tells me it is not allowed but then offers me another company that specializes in helping do exactly that?  Is there any way I can get around this? 

I'm the one paying the mortgage; shouldn't I be able to pay it as I see fit as long as it is being paid in time?  Oh, and my bank is Wells Fargo. When I bought the house, it was a local bank I went through and then they sold it to Wells Fargo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a Sophomore in High School, I took a Hispanic girl who wasn't from my school to my Homecoming.  When I went to pick her up at her house, I walked in the front door and was greeted with a HUGE painting of Jesus. When I went into the living room, there were prayer candles lit everywhere and another HUGE picture of the Last Supper.

That was my first experience with dedicated Catholics. </TEXT>

When I retired at the end of 2014, I put mine up there and although it took 1.5 years, I was just discovered and hired from that resume and am going to start working 1 August of this year.  I don't even match what their job description describes 100% (more like 60%) but the TS helped alot.

	<TEXT> I believe that everyone can teach. The tough part is being organized and following a specific training plan. I spent a small part of last year substitute teaching at a local school system (a small Alaska School System) and I have had no experience teaching. The most challenging day was when I subbed a 4th grade class. There, I had to actually teach a little bit and help the kids out with rudimentary math. It was fun and I felt as though I had actually accomplished something at the end of the day. But to do it everyday and have a training plan to put together and stick to. Well, that would be tough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had just arrived at Great Lakes for Boot Camp (This was in 1991) and we are standing in line for our first introduction to what is known in the military as "Operation Golden Flow" or our first urinalysis test. As I'm standing in a VERY long line and tip tapping around because I have to piss so much, a guy standing behind me taps me on the shoulder and asks what we are waiting for. I look at him and tell him "A Urinalysis".

He looks at me and asks me what a urinalysis is, so I tell him "To see who has taken any drugs recently".

He nods, shrugs and says "Well, I guess I shouldn't have smoked that crack last night". He was serious. That's when I knew he wouldn't make it through boot camp.

Now, he officially wasn't fired that first day, but about 2 weeks later when his results came back he was. So yes, you can say that he was fired that first day but had to suffer for a few weeks until officially let go. </TEXT>
