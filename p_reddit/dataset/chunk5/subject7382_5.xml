	<TEXT> Dominion bow is a 3 piece set. It's really only used for the unresistable damage enchant. Not the set bonuses. Vice cannon seemed cool at first but it's subpar in pvp as everything is cut in half as far as dam and healing </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that's my build pretty much. I stopped running DW unless it's for trials. Normally I'll run resto back bar or destro/destro (for the spell damage enchant). Sometimes I'll off heal trials with resto too. Lots of flexibility.
  
Some good sets to look into-
TBS-thief and shadow
Julianos
Scathing mage(must be all divines)
Kena(always proc, light attack weave always)
Nerienth
  
Important things to keep in mind. Flame damage!!!!! Get an inferno mael staff sharpened or precise. Shooting star is your main ultimate. Soul harvest back bar for executes.
  
Typical bars- merciless resolve, swallow soul, impale, inner light, ele blockade, shooting star, soul harvest sap essence, harness magicka, siphoning attacks, rapid regen, healing ward, reapers mark, refreshing path(twisting if you use scathing) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good direction for both. I'd probably use 5 hundings- 5 marksman with a dominion/pact/covenant bow for the unresistable enchant for pvp. Head shoulders jewelry marksman, rest hundings. I use that setup but with the mael bow, and it's really well balanced as far as sustain/damage output. Try using a 2h in PVP as well, that helps a good bit (and less expensive). 
  
Pve looks good. I'd probably put rearming trap on the DW bar for passive dam increase </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are still skill points from the main quest line in each zone. The xp gain isn't negligible, contrary to what others said. The items drops are though. Keep doing the daily pledges, hold onto all your keys til cp160. Keep leveling mages and fighters guilds and don't worry about over leveling too much for your zone. Some like to power level and disregard quests, others do 'completionism' on one character and grind the rest. Lots of freedom already with how you want to play. One Tamriel is still a ways out so no reason to wait til then IMO. </TEXT>
