	<TITLE> I have been struggling with weight loss all my life, sort of yoyo dieting through the years. Then I thought it would be amazing to go through this whole journey or partial journey with people who are like me. Why do you think it would be helpful or why not? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I was thinking if I would find other people who are like me, who weigh as much as me, who are as tall as me, who has as much free time as me, who make as much money as me, who have two kids like me and married, who like similar food like me, who are similar to me genetics wise, ethnic and cultural background wise. I know it seems like a lot of specifications but let's say if I got lucky and found a few people, and let's say we created a sort of weight loss challenge, don't you think it could be easier to lose weight, to get motivated, because we could all see what each others are doing and we could see what works and what not and we could copy each other's' techniques, recipes and exercises. I feel like this way I would find less excuses for myself and knew that since everybody is in a similar life situation and have similar genetics and backgrounds, I could find less excuses. What do you think? </TEXT>
