	<TEXT> I use:

* Non-dairy milk: almond, soy, cashew, coconut - sometimes they go alone, sometimes combined, in this case it was soy and cashew combined.
* Spinach
* Carrots
* Kale
* Avocados
* Raw Eggs
* Banana
* Raw Honey
* Green tea matcha powder (that's what the box is)
* Cucumber
* Berries (varies depending on season and availabilty) 

What you see there is divided into four batches which yields six large mason jars:

So per batch I use about 2 teaspoons of matcha, just a little over a cup of milk, roughly two carrots, one and a quarter banana, half a cucumber, one egg (although sometimes i'll scramble and egg and divide that into four), half an avocado, 1 half bushel of kale, a quarter of the large bag of spinach, a large handful of berries, and the honey is added last to adjust for taste, it changes depending how sweet the berries and bananas are. Sometimes I'll squeeze half a lime in for some acidity but I often forget to buy that when I'm at kingstupids. 

This stuff gets really thick when I'm blending especially after you add the avocado so sometimes I'll have to add more milk or a little water to keep the from creating the dreaded smoothie bubble. I blend it like there's no tomorrow there are no visible particles, everything's raw and have it for lunch. This has been my lunch for about a year now. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I am completely new to scripting, how can I write a script that will automatically find a missing font and replace it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-10 22:42:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I actually have all the missing fonts but they are named differently on the new workstation and there doesn't seem to be a way to rename the font so that Illustrator wouldn't find things missing. I figured I could write a script that will find and replace the fonts automatically (at least with about a dozen of the most common fonts).

So I'll open up a file:
http://i.imgur.com/dTMpt5I.png

then I'll have to find every missing font even though clearly I have them.
http://i.imgur.com/8BUFUA1.png

I literally have thousands of files I have to do this with and it's an absolute pain and kills production.

Absolutely any help with this would be fantastic! Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I got foreclosed on about 4 years ago, my mother co-signed and we both got hit with the foreclosure. She's getting roughly 100K and wants to put it in a house straight away, the house is 250K.

My questions:

Since she's putting down so much, does she even need a co-signer for the other 150K? 
 
If I co-sign for said 150K, will I be able yet again co-sign for a different loan say when my SO and I decide a house win about a year or so?

If not, how difficult would it be to then sign over everything completely over to my mom? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I design labels for a chemical company and there are standards that must be met when putting warnings on labels, there are different size requirements depending on the volume of the container. What I've done is create the warnings as a separate file and I would then place it as a linked file on the label but as I mentioned earlier, they need to be different sizes for different volumes.

The warning file is sized to the smallest volume, so when I place the warning on those labels, it's just a click (no resizing). Now, I want to have multiple artboards of the same warning but in a different size to use that *one-click* feature without having to resize it. I'm trying to streamline this process because I have over 7000 different labels I need to put warnings on and going in and resizing the label for every label that isn't the minimum volume would be absolutely dreadful.

If there was a way to have one artboard be the source while the other three arboards mirror that artboard I could one artboard to edit and it would then ripple across every label. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking for a way to make a master artboard and then have three other artboards that duplicate the master arboard but in different sizes. I do not want to place a linked file because I want to be able to use it as a template. Placing a linked file, everytime I save as a new file it references the old file and I have to relink to the new file that's been created.

Essentially I want to be able to use the "place linked file" but instead of *file* I want it to be an artboard within the document, is this possible? </TEXT>

I heavily rely on this extension to rip about 20 videos from youtube daily and it seems to be broken on OSX, anyone know what happened or can anyone suggest a comparable plugin on either FF or GC? Video DownloadHelper is great because it parses the h.264 mp4 at 720 without any conversion.

Any help would be great! Thanks!

edit: Went back to firefox 34.0.5 and Video DownloadHelper seems to be working fine, looks like the issue is with FF </TEXT>

Is this deceptively simple or am I not seeing how difficult this is going to be? Anything helps!

	<TEXT> This is going to be an everyday jacket that will occasionally be used on the slopes in Colorado. Being how bi-polar our weather is the versatility is a huge factor. Trying not to break the bank, budget will probably be about $350.

To give a little style reference I'm liking North Face's Triclimate Vortex and their Mountain Light but from what I hear 3-in-1's (regardless of brand) use lesser quality material and there's much debate about North Face's brand anyhow. So I'm on a quest to find separate pieces what will zip together, this is sort of a big factor for me as I want to be able to throw the jacket on without having to "double put on".

I'm brand agnostic and open to any suggestions. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking at least 60", 1080P, low latency, no smart capabilities, at least 3 HDMI ports, and IR remote. I don't need any smart capabilities, no real need for a small bezel, no need for built-in audio, and no need for 3D.

I remember reading somewhere a while back that there's a company that sells giant screens like this for pretty cheap but can't remember who it was.

Mostly looking for my uncle. He's got this Mitsubishi DLP that has outlived its life, I've changed the bulb on it at least a dozen times and now the DLP mirrors have locked up putting white specs all over the projection. It's a 73" so he's wanting something comparable. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm looking for a reusable vacuum sealing system </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I currently use the [pistol vac](http://amzn.com/B008LW73UY) and at first it was great, the setup vacuumed beautifully but now something that used to take 2min to vacuum now takes nearly 6-7min. The sealing valves seem to wear out pretty quickly on the bags (or maybe it's the gun?).

I prefer using the zip-top system over something like a foodsaver because I'm constantly accessing different foods and would rather not waste bags by constantly sealing things like bacon, cheese, avocado, etc.

Any suggestions out there or am I stuck with Waring? </TEXT>
