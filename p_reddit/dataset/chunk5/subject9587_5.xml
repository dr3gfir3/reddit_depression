	<TEXT> Mozzarella was the only cheese I had on hand and I figured it was close enough to queso fresco

For the recipe, I don't have exact measurements so you can add more/less of an ingredient you like/dislike

Ingredients
1 large tomato chopped
1/2-1 white onion chopped
1.5-2 cups of lime juice for cook
1/4 cups of lime or orange juice for taste (optional)
1/2-1 cup cilantro
Seasoning salt to taste
Mozzarella for topping (or queso fresco)
Fried tortilla
Cabbage sliced thinly for bedding (optional)
1 lb halibut cut into small bite sized pieces (or any other firm white meat fish like sea bass)

Steps
Soak/cook the halibut, onions and lime juice. Place in fridge for 20 minutes.
Cook time varies on preference. I used serious eats recommendation of 20 minutes. Rick bayless does his for 2-3 hours

Drain the lime juice from mixture, unfortunately this juice is too fishy to be repurposed elsewhere

Mix in tomatoes and cilantro

Add seasoned salt and lime/orange juice to taste

Serve on fried tortilla and a bed of cabbage

	<TEXT> Hi All, I've been searching everywhere for this song. The artists' voice reminds me of Nick Cave but none of his songs seem to be the right one. Here's a vocaroo link; unfortunately, I couldn't remember any words and only the melody.
