	<TEXT>  The Spanish police "broke down our door at night, and put us on the floor in front of our 4-year-old son, Maria Levashova told reporters. **They talked of some virus that my husband created, that helped Trump win.**  She was allegedly informed by local police that he was suspected of various cyber crimes, including hacking related to the U.S. election. But those allegations have not been confirmed by the U.S. government.

Good thing the FBI is still on this, the smoke might just turn to fire soon.

Edit: This looks good but until it is shown as true, all we can do is keep connecting the dots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If the election was in two more weeks, Thompson might win, a Kansas Republican strategist told The Hill. Thank God the election is tomorrow.

Let's hope the people of Kansas show up today and prove that strategist wrong. 

Also:

 In a last-minute effort to boost Estess chances, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spent nearly $100,000 for Estes with TV and digital ads. In the TV ad, Republicans cast Thompson as too extreme for Kansas, claiming that he supports late-term abortions.

 Thompsons campaign pushed back, calling the spot outright false and asked a local radio station to pull it. Despite Thompsons protests, an NRCC official said it was completely accurate and still airing, according to the Wichita Eagle. 

GOP motto: Play dirty to win no matter what. </TEXT>

* Trump-Russian ties are "muddled" with this attack on Russia's "ally"
* (Isn't sarin gas a Russian WMD?)
* Rubble clears and there are no casualties but civilians
* Russia threatens US
* US makes a diplomatic option with Russia by easing sanctions with them

	<TEXT> Probably be down voted for this but I don't think everyone that voted for Donald Trump were stupid. They voted because they had a candidate that they thought would fight for their rights, the unheard. But, after everything that has happened I am more surprised that people are still standing fully with him.

In the end, I can only hope it will be like Ulysses S Grant said:

 "The war is over  the rebels are our countrymen again." </TEXT>

 According to Mr Nunes, some communications from the Trump team  and possibly Trump himself  were subject to legal, incidental collection before his inauguration.

If you do not understand what the term legal means it is thus:

 of, based on, or concerned with the law. Or permitted by law. </TEXT>
