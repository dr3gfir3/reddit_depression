	<TEXT> I don't think Bosh is unlikeable, but as a fan I'm happier to face Boston in the first round as opposed to Miami. We've had a lot better luck with Boston than Miami this season.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't help but think it was intentional by Atlanta to some degree. As a fan I would much rather see Boston in the first round as opposed to Miami, and I would imagine the players feel the same way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will agree with that statement. Kobe has played all 20 seasons with the Lakers. Magic only played 13, and Kareem and Shaq were more than Lakers, they played for multiple teams. Had Kareem or Shaq played only for the Lakers or had Magic played longer I would put one of them number 1, but that didn't happen so Kobe is number 1 to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kareem wasn't only a Laker though. Nobody is saying Kobe is the best player ever, just the best Laker. Had Kareem played all 20 seasons for the Lakers I would put him above Kobe.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The store will make people from home office human resources available to talk to associates if necessary. And some people may leave early. 

I actually know this from experience. We had an employee die in the break room at my store a couple years ago.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really liked Joe in Atlanta. Didn't like his contract when he re-signed though. 

Glad to see he's having success in Miami. Hopefully he can get a ring before he retires. He's a great player.  </TEXT>
