	<TEXT> We do stuff like that all the time honestly. If someone can't afford it then we charge half/nothing/whatever you wanna pay. And we have a university a few blocks away so we usually charge half for them because generally college life is pretty expensive.

We're here to help people, and we get enough business from other businesses, car lots, and crazy rich people, that we can afford to give a regular person a break once in a while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After my last post, I was reminded of another story where I was awoken from my slumber.

So I'm sleeping away like a madman, and I get a phone call that wakes me up a little after midnight.

Me: "Locksmith"

Cop: "Yeah this is Officer Dude of the Name of City police department"

Oh crap what did I do

Me: "Yes, what can I do for you?"

Cop: "Yeah, sorry to bother you at this hour, but we've got a very intoxicated lady here locked out of her house, can you come out and unlock it for us?"

Oh good, I'm not in trouble

Me: "Yeah, no problem, be there in a few minutes"

So I get up, get dressed, and head out. I get there like 20 minutes later, and there's 2 police cruisers sitting out front, and a completely wasted 60 year old woman in her pajamas

Cop: "Hey, thanks for coming out this late, I'm officer dude, I called you out. We just need you to open the door so we can go in and clear the house, she thinks her ex boyfriend is inside"

So I agree, and I get it open in like 30 seconds, he just laughs at how stupidly easy it was, lady's just standing there like "DANG I NEED TO GET ME SOME OF THEM FANCY TOOLS THERE"

Cop: "Alright, me and officer bro here will go in and make sure the house is clear. Just please keep her out here until we give the all clear."

So they go in and I'm stuck out here with this crazy drunk lady.

"OH MAN THEY'RE GOIN IN THERE WITH THEIR GUNS OUT AND EVERYTHING, I HOPE THEY GET THAT OLD BOY IN THERE"

"OH MAN DO YOU LIKE DISTURBED? THAT NEW SOUND OF SILENCE SONG IS GREAT, LOVE EM"

"OH MAN THEY'RE TAKING A LONG TIME IN THERE I WONDER IF MY BOY GOT EM"

"HEY DO YOU THINK THEY'RE OK IN THERE"

"I WISH THEY'D HURRY UP, I'M STARVING HERE"

"HEY YOU WANT A BEER? IF THEY'D HURRY UP AND GET OUT HERE I'LL GO GET YOU ONE"

After 5 excruciating minutes with her, they finally give us the all clear. She goes in to get her checkbook, pays me, then gives me a crisp $1 bill. 

"THAT'S FOR BEING SUCH GREAT COMPANY" 

Then she winks at me.

So I nope on out of there, the cops are outside and ask me for some business cards, so I give them a few and make my way down to my nice warm bed.

Old drunk people are weird. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So as stated in previous stories, we advertise 24/7 emergency service. This is stuff like keys locked in cars/houses, lost keys, stuff like that.

So yesterday morning I wake up to my phone ringing at 2am. 

 Me: "Locksmith"

 Guy: "Yeah how much are your keys"

At this point I'm just guessing he lost his car keys, because why the heck would you be calling me at 2am if you didn't

 Me: "What kind of keys? What do they go to?"

 Guy: "My house"

 Me: "Oh, so you lost them then?"

 Guy: "No I just need a couple copies made, I'm at your shop now"

At this point I'm just really flipping annoyed because it's obviously not an emergency

 Me: "Well normally they're $1.50, and if you come back Monday morning I'll be able to make them for you"

 Guy: "Can't you come now?"

 Me: "It's 2 in the morning"

 Guy: "But your sign says 24/7 service"

 Me: "Yes it does, but that's emergency service, and this doesn't sound like an emergency. Things like making keys can wait until office hours"

 Guy: "But I need keys now"

 Me: "Then in that case, I'll be happy to come down, but I'll have to give you an emergency service charge of $60 on top of the keys"

 Guy: "That's stupid, I'm not paying you that"

 Me: "Goodnight then" *click*

	<TEXT> Alright guys, back for more. Just getting off work and had a fun phone call today.

So our day starts off as usual, I'm sitting around in the lock shop, waiting for customers, and the phone rings. 

 Me: "[my name] locksmi-"

 Guy: "Yeah, your guys were down here this morning and they f-d up my door. I want a refund and for someone to come down here and fix it, I didn't pay $500 for someone to come and f*** me"

 Me: "Well I'm very sorry sir, what's your name, and where was this?" 

 Guy: "[gives his name and address], but I don't know why you have to ask, you guys just left half an hour ago"

Now at this point I realize it couldn't have been us because it's just me and my dad here, and he just left the shop a few minutes ago. But there is another locksmith in town that's notorious for overcharging and cutting corners. I'll call them Acme.

 Me: "I'm sorry, but are you looking for Acme locksmith?"

 Guy: "Yeah, so get your a** down here and fix my door"

 Me: "Sir this is OP locksmith, Acme is across town and not affiliated with us"

 Guy: "You're a locksmith aren't you? You guys owe me my money back for breaking my sh**"

 Me: "Yes we are, but not the one that messed up your door. We don't owe you anything."

 Guy: "Just get your f-ing manager on the phone so I can talk to someone who knows what they're talking about"

At this point I was just going to tell him to call Acme and then hang up, but nah.

 Me in a slightly lower voice: "Hi, what can I do for you today?"

 Guy: *same as before*

 Me: "oh I see, we haven't been out anywhere this morning, you're looking for Acme, here's their number, call them"

 Guy: "Oh okay, thank you sir, sorry for the mistake" *click*
