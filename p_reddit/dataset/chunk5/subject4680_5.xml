	<TEXT> Mine began in seventh grade when the class read Animal Farm. Before that I had always thought literature existed solely for entertainment, and I thought there were many better ways of being entertained. Books were just stories. Animal Farm was different. For the first time I was told to analyze a book and try to find deeper meaning. Normally I would have said this was obnoxiously searching for something the author never wanted in their little story, but Animal Farm made me face the fact that I was wrong. It took me a long while to want to read into books with less obvious symbols and meanings, but after reading this book I knew literature had an extreme importance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've thought about that. IMO I think writers probably get a lot more frustrated by words than most people. I'm no writer but I can relate in that stories seem to be much more effective translations of reality than words. I think that's why novels are "more popular" than poetry. Because novels (generally) tell stories where poems (generally) use words. One is more effective. And I think authors more than anyone realize that fact.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll go first. I really liked the scene where Samual punched Adam. I was frankly shocked and I think this shows what's so good about the book. It was hardly mentioned how dramatic character development this but we understood this anyway. 

The scene where Cathy shoots Adam sorta haunts me. That entire chapter built tension really well, and even though we knew what was coming I was still frightened by it, hardly believing it.

Also just... any scene involving Caleb. I love that kid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finished it last night and... wow. I'm honestly very sad it's over. I've never enjoyed reading a book more. No book has made me feel more emotions in my entire life, and no book has shown me more about the world than this.

So, here are my questions for anyone that would like to discuss it:

What are your favorite scenes?

Who are your favorite characters?

What books like this could you suggest?

How does this compare with other Steinbeck novels?

And please just say anything else you'd like to throw out there.

Thank you! </TEXT>
