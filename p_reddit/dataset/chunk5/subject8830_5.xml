	<TEXT> Honesty, I had never heard of Gabbard before she endorsed Sanders so I am skeptical of her having the name recognition needed. That being said, no one had heard of Obama either, so maybe with. HUGE push from Sanders she might have footing, but would still probably lose to Biden. Sanders on the other hand, would probably take it. Still Warren has the name recognition, voting history, is a woman (which, yeah yeah yeah, shouldn't matter) and I think people would get over her not supporting anyone during the primaries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The DNC, liberal media, etc. all still refuse to admit this. Unless Elizabeth Warren runs in 4 years, we will get another establishment Democrat in the Whitehouse. Sadly, progressive is just a word for too many people. Too many are happy with a mediocre status quo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. I'm not saying there were not things released that they (DNC/Clinton) didn't want released, but the entire issue, IMO, was how the DNC treated Sanders. Millions of Sanders' supporters voted for Trump, or third party, just  to spite the DNC and because they felt Clinton was a horrible candidate and person.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I would feel the same. I know not everyone believes that two wrongs don't make a right, but I was raised that way. Saving tax dollars does not seem like a good justification for killing. And since the death penalty does nothing to prevent such crimes, it being a deterrent can't be used as an argument either. So basically it comes down to, in my opinion, people who have too little compassion or really care about money that much. Both reasons are unbelievably horrific to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do "we" really believe that a horrific decision cannot change a person?  It turns out that my father beat his first couple wives. They both hid his kids from him, which was probably good at the time, but he eventually found god and became a SUPER compassionate man. I knew him in his druggie anger days and that buy who spent his last decade plus living as a missionary in Ukraine. I don't know if this guy changed. But I think there is both an ethical and moral argument to be made, like out forefathers made, for there not to be "cruel and unusual punishment". Sadly, many, if not most, people are not so enlightened to see this.

Most of my OC posts go nowhere and, though often berated, reposts have a true value in this and most social media realms. By value I mean that people appreciate them for some length of time. Since people are introduced to things at different times, these and all the FB clutter often propagate long after some people are tired of seeing it. There was a reason I didn't post it to /r/progresspics and titled it in a way that did not indicate this was me: I just like sharing things I think others will appreciate.  </TEXT>
