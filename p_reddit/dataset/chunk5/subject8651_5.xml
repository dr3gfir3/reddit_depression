	<TEXT> Damnit ok why do people do this. Why do people quote the entire post they're responding to? Like we get that you're responding to that post cuz you...responded to that post. Why pull out the relevant parts of the post when it's just the whole damn post..?

I'm sorry this isn't relevant but I keep seeing people do this and I can't sit idly by any longer.

Agree 100%.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah don't worry about it. J. Cole's new album had to be explained on twitter (some guy posted what the album was about and it got over 100,000 likes) for people to understand it when the songs literally say what it's about, and there are no metaphors or implied meanings. 

That's the fun part about music tbh is figuring out what projects mean to you so I would take that challenge as fun.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sub can be pretty dumb and removing his shit is one step towards it being less dumb. Before mods come in the top comment on anticipated posts are like "I hope no one sees this but I'm gay". You could easily say "but BRO. That comment is a JOKE stop taking it seriously."

I don't take it seriously. But the fact is this sub looks a lot more dumb with stupid shit like that on here. But then Filthy Frank's fans say he's a real artist and that's where the actual beef begins. I don't care that he makes cool beats. He makes shitty humor videos where he does gross shit and that's what he'll be known for until he actually actively pursues a career in rap. That's why removing his shit is smart, but IMO, removing Lil Dicky's shit is wack.  </TEXT>

How hard is it to make a MyPark format where you're not standing around waiting to play?

I understand it's supposed to mimic real life pick-up, but this is a fucking game. Waiting to play is the worst part of going to play pick-up. Why does it have to be in-game too? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Did Tom Wilhelmsen try to sabotage the Rangers? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-08 17:13:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before this post begins, I'd like to point out this is ~~very tongue-in-cheek and is not supposed to be taken seriously~~ completely supposed to be taken seriously.

But seriously, what is this horseshit. 

Wilhelmsen has been with the Mariners from 2011-2015, and in this timespan had a 2.97 ERA. The Rangers traded Leonys Martin (currently batting .244 with 13 homers) to the Mariners for Wilhelmsen, and two other players. Wilhelmsen was moved away from the city he had grown his MLB career in, without any personal input, so his feelings about this trade are questionable. 

Wilhelmsen had a 10.55 ERA for the Rangers in 21 appearances. Twenty. One. Appearances. How does a player go from 2.97 ERA to a 10.55? In June, the Rangers sent Wilhelmsen down the minors, and he refused the assignment, forfeiting $1.8 million. He becomes a free agent, and guess where he signs?

The fucking Seattle Mariners. For $508,000. 

He's had 15 appearances so far for the Mariners. What's his ERA so far?

Fucking 2.08. 

This is bullshit, and I want to publicly call you out for it Tom Wilhelmsen. You're a modern-day Black Sock in my book. 

EDIT: Statistical data from fangraphs pointed out by /u/nckdmss. You can tell exactly when Wilhelmsen began pitching for the Mariners this year just based on the velocity spike. http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfxo.aspx?playerid=9975 position=P pitch=FA

What some have commented is the fact the Rangers made Wilhelmsen increase his cut fastball usage to 25% from 15%. While true, doesn't explain the wild increase from 2.97 to a 10.55 ERA. He could have worked on it in AAA ball but he opted out. 

Wilhelmsen in a radio interview:

"It wasn't by choice [making the Rangers lose], ... I was so used to beating the Rangers and.. Nothing changes I guess ... The front office made me feel as comfortable as I could but there just wasn't a fit. I tried to fake it [feeling at home in Texas] as much as I could"

	<TEXT> I know mods are a little strict so I made this a text post. Hopefully that discourages them from removing this post.

I was looking through Porzingis's old tweets for fun and thought what the hell, why not share it with /r/nba, so here we are.

Here's an album of a few tweets from Porzingis's twitter http://imgur.com/a/ujPdM

	<TEXT> I've got Charter internet (paying for 60mbps) running through an Arris phone/internet modem (model TM902A), to a Linksys EA6350 router. 15 devices are connected to it, but I'm sure that's not why the connection is so shit. Sometimes it runs 25 Mbps, but most of the time it runs at 5 Mbps and drops off a lot (lots of lagging, buffering). It will even drop off to .5 Mbps. I don't know what to do, I've changed the channel on the router, I've switched out cables, tried using a range extender, even called Charter for help just for them to tell me the internet works, all to no avail. Can't figure out why it can't seem to give me a stable connection. </TEXT>

Huston Street (84 to 86) *downgraded to 83*

Jonathan Papelbon (84 to 86/87) *correct*

Lance Lynn (84 to 86) *downgraded to 83*

Eric Hosmer (84 to 85) *upgraded to 85 then downgraded to 84*

Jake Odorizzi (84 to 85) *downgraded to 83*

Zach Britton (84 to 87) *upgraded to 86*

Stephen Vogt (84 to 85) *downgraded to 78*

AJ Burnett (83 to 85) *downgraded to 82*

Carlos Martinez (83 to 85) *upgraded to 84*

Drew Storen (83 to 86) *upgraded to 84*

Brandon Crawford (83 to 87/88) *upgraded to 86*

Josh Reddick (83 to 85) *downgraded to 80*

AJ Ramos (83 to 85) *downgraded to 82*

Joc Pederson (83 to 86/87) *downgraded to 77*

Hector Santiago (83 to 86) *downgraded to 81*

Charlie Blackmon (82 to 86) *downgraded to 81*

Shawn Tolleson (82 to 85) *downgraded to 80*

Devon Travis (82 to 84/85) *stayed the same*

Mookie Betts (82 to 85) *stayed the same*

Noah Syndergaard (82 to 85) *correct*

Joe Panik (81 to 87) *upgraded to 84*

Xander Bogaerts (80 to 86) *upgraded to 83*

Mark Melancon (82 to 85/86) *upgraded to 83*

Maikel Franco (81 to 85) *stayed the same*

Rougned Odor (80 to 85) *upgraded to 81*

Carlos Correa (77 to 87) *correct*

Manny Machado (92 to 95) *upgraded to 94*

Jason Kipnis (89 to 94) *downgraded to 85 then upgraded to 89*

Joey Votto (89 to 93) *upgraded to 90*

Corey Kluber (91 to 93) *downgraded to 90 then back to 91*

David Price (92 to 93) *downgraded to 91*

Chris Archer (91 to 93) *upgraded to 92*

All in all, thats 13 downgrades, 9 no changes, and 17 upgrades.

How I did predictions was finding 3 players from each OVR level, averaging out their WAR, then looking at all 82-84 OVR players to see if they line up. I had to make special cases for catchers and relief pitchers, as their WAR value differs.

	<TEXT> Royals now have Cueto (92), Zobrist (79) (LG: Brett 94)

Blue Jays now have Tulowitzki (93), Price (92) (LG: Carter 85)

Rockies now have Reyes (88) (LG: Bichette 85)

Nationals now have Papelbon (84) (LG: Dawson 94)

Dodgers now have Latos (79), Arroyo (79), Wood (80), Morse (74) (LG: Hershiser 91)

Rangers now have Hamels (89), Diekman (78) (LG: Ryan 98)

Pirates now have Soria (83) (LG: Kiner 98)

Astros now have Gomez (89), Kazmir (84), Fiers (77) (LG: Bagwell 98)

#So that means...

Reds loss of Cueto means Gold Reds players go up in value

Other gold Royals players should lose value

Tulo should stay same price, Price should lose value

Reyes will stay the same price

Papelbon = irrelevant

Dodgers = irrelevant

Pirates = irrelevant

Phillies gold players should go up in value, Rangers golds should slightly decrease

Should pick up Gomez off the Brewers and Kazmir before their value goes up, Keuchel and Altuve should stay stagnant

Tigers loss of Price should mean Tigers players will increase in value </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need a cheap arm to add to your starters to get your team off the ground, Matt Cain is your guy (less than 100 stubs) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-28 22:22:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just got my 3rd CGSO in a row with this guy... 15-1 in the 1600's.

Cain throws a 92mph 4seam, 86mph slider, 84mph change, 78mph 12-6, and a 91mph 2seam.

Every at bat starts with a low or high fastball, a 12-6 out of the zone, a change up on the bottom border of the zone, and ends with a 2seam on the outside corner. Gets 'em every time. I have a 1.73 ERA with him over 20 starts, and is worth giving a shot if some of the gold pitchers you use are getting rocked. </TEXT>
