The main points I was trying to make is that board-access isn't "required" to play so if OP doesn't want to make a new account or ask her niece's parents to sign the form, it's not a huge deal.  The second point was that maybe, being 11, she wouldn't care and only want to play he games or what-have-you.  e_e </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there!

If you're considering WoW you might want to check out /r/wownoob to find other newbies or have your questions answered.

Having said that, you might enjoy playing a Rogue or possibly Shaman, though Shaman do have magic they are melee with a tiny bit of ranged.  There's no *real* difference between races.  It's mostly visual, so just pick what design you like the best.  (Master Draenei race, though.) </TEXT>

I don't remember exactly but I believe you had to track when the night terrors occurred, then wake the child up 15-20 minutes before one would be coming.  The thought was eventually the child would grow out of them.

My brother, who dates some chick that drives an ambulance or something, is about as different from me as night is different from day.  Yeah.  Its clich but Im not a writing major.  Im a Sophomore in high school and I dont care what you think about how I write.  Im doing my best to actually type out all the words correctly because normally I type 1yk3 d15 0nl1n3.  No, Im not trolling you.  All of the people in my guild do it, because its funny mess with n00bs.


So my brother goes out and does his thing but I like to stay home and play video games.  Doesnt matter what game, I do it.  All I ever ask for on my birthday or Christmas is a new gaming system or new games.  Or computer part upgrades.  (Because PC Master race, amiright?!  Lolol kekekek huehuehue)  And guess what?  My parents buy them for me because Im a god-mode student.  I get straight As in my Honors Classes.  Some of them I earned.  Maybe one or two I fixed using my knowledge of Photoshop.  They were Bs that could have been As but I cant miss my raid times, and I cant miss my Call of Duty war games so I guess I have to miss studying sometimes.


The only thing my parents really say to me is that they wish Id go outside more, maybe play a sport but yeah right, I dont want to strap 10 pounds of pads to my skinny ass frame (thanks, genetics!  I can eat what I want and it doesnt matter!) just to get tackled by some big fatty.  No thanks.  And besides I can always play sports games on any of the systems I have.  I rarely do, but I CAN.  Other than that they leave me alone.


Well, yesterday I turned 16 so my parents thought it would be nice to buy me a new cell phone (??) because we got this new carrier called P-Mobile.  Not exactly what I wanted, but so far the app selection is pretty interesting.   Theres a few in here that I havent heard of before.  I downloaded a couple of the free versions.  I messed around with the phones features.


This phone came standard with a VR (virtual reality for you non-1337 p33p5) program and headset.  I turned it on and tried it out.  It was just a free trial.  It showed me in a warehouse.  I looked around and I saw a couple of werido, rotting corpse things standing in the corner.  As I noticed them, they noticed me.  Zombies!  I laughed and cheered because this was going to be awesome.  But as they drew near, the game kind of froze and an ad popped up, asking if I wanted to download the full version, bonus levels, if I wanted to order some special gun weapon controllers.  Um, yes?  I took the VR set off my head and ordered a few things.  Set that to ship to me overnight.  Cause my parents want me to be happy, right?  Happy 16th birthday!


The next day my packages come and I tear right into them.  I hefted the first gun up, admiring it.  It was made of this heavy plastic-ish stuff.  I strapped the fake knife to my thigh.  And yes, before you criticize me, I took it out of the sheath and ran it over the ball of my thumb.  It was plastic and didnt cut anything.  Sheesh.


I go ahead and insert this little simcard thing into my phone  the full version of the Zombie Apocalypse game.  (Weird, I didnt know phones even had that feature and Im pretty 5M4rT when it comes to this stuff.)  The phone gives a little ping! notification when its done, and it took like 5 seconds to install.  I strap it into the VR set and I sit down in my chair in my bedroom.


I enter the game in the same weird warehouse.  I look around and start moving all while sitting in my chair.  Guys  I didnt fucking move I swear from that chair.  I go about demolishing zombies and shit and its great.  Highscore!  Hell yes Ill post this to my InstaFace account!  Let me drink in the likes from my fellow gamers and jealous classmates.  I played for a long time.  I got maybe, halfway through the game.  I was destroying zombies left and right, finding more ammo, plowing through it all.  I found some snacks in the game, like soda and pizza that I would eat and it replenished my healthbar.  Basic, but I could almost taste the flavours on my tongue.  All the while trying to explore this building, and I guess find a way out?  I collect a few quests along the way, like one from a cute NPC girl in the beginning who died (RIP LOLOLOL) about finding a cure or some junk.  Im going through and I just realized that I had lost track of time.  The game seemed so real.


I switched the game off, and laid my weapons down and removed the VR set from my head.  Man, my palms were sweaty af holding onto that gun and knife so tightly.


WAIT.  WHAT IS THIS?  My arms up to my elbows are covered in blood.  Like, red and green blood and bits ofgreyish squishy stuffthat might just bezombie brains??  I looked around my room again, and saw zombie bodies piled up around my chair.  Some with knife wounds.  Some with bullet holes.  All not moving.  Blood all over the walls.  My bed was knocked over.  But Ithe game is off!  I glanced next to me, and on my little TV tray where crumbled cans of soda and pizza crusts.  GuysI didnt have snacks with me when I started.  The soda didnt have a brand name on it.  It was just a red can.


I kind of greyed out here for a bit.  When I looked around again, the sun was shining very brightly in through my window, which was weird because it only does that in the morning.and I started playing this game in the early afternoon.  I cautiously looked around again, literally petrified of what I was going to see.


My room looked.completely normal.  No zombie corpses.  I wasnt covered in blood.  My bed was neatly made in the corner.  (What?  Im a gamer not a savage!)  Had I justfallen asleep?  I glanced at the TV tray.  Aside from a few crumbs, it was empty.  


I shifted in my chair, and I could feel the cramps of siting in a chair all night complaining.  Maybe I needed to take a break from this game.  I mean, I didnt even remember falling asleep.  Placing my cell phone and VR headset on the tray, I stood up and stretched.  My foot kicked something.  I looked down.  It was a crushed red soda can.  Sticking from the mouth opening was a piece of notebook paper.  I bent down and picked it up.  It had 4 tasks written down in my hand writing; one of them was crossed off:


*  Completely explore the warehouse.
*  Rescue 5 survivors.  Bonus:  Rescue 10 survivors.
*  Discover cure vial.
*  ~~Collect 3 zombie eyes.~~


I touched my pocket softly.  It squished.  I reached in and pulled out 3 faded, cataract clouded eyes.  I gagged.  What was this?  In my confused time of stress, all my poor mind could come up with was this  My cell phones VR is incredible!  I felt sanity slip.  I passed out again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was my best friend, and I killed him.  If I am to be honest, I must say the truth, even if it hurts.  I must give this confession now, before it is too late.  Only the gods know when it will be too late.

Dolan was a blonde haired, blue eyed farm boy.  Me, I am a brunette half-angel.  Back then my wings were pure white.  We met each other by the blessing of the Sun God.  We were both training to be Paladins of the Light.  We, along with several others, heard the call and decided to dedicate our lives and Souls to Him above all other gods.  Paladins are special warriors that are adept at weaponry, but are also able to call down our chosen gods powers to assist us in small ways.

We made our way through our training with little problem.  We helped each other learn our spells, and I helped Dolan master some more complex swordplay.  When we were to graduate and adventure on our own, it was only natural that we decided to travel together and spread the word of the Sun God to all who would listen.

And so it was, for several years.  In my eyes, we were just two best friends.  Nothing more.  I never saw that Dolan wanted more than this.  I never had a clue.  I guess I did not know him as well as I thought I did.

Then came that fateful week.  We arrived just after dark to a small village in the middle of a forest.  It was not marked on our maps, but that was not unusual for us.  Oftentimes little villages would spring up out of nowhere.  We were welcomed by the villagers with open arms, but one villager in particular caught my attention.  When the villager and I made eye contact, I could feel an unfamiliar yet not unpleasant tingling all over my body.  I blushed faintly.  From the moment I saw him, I knew hed be something special to me.  

He had blonde hair so light it was almost white, pale skin, the small and pointed ears of his Elven race, and hypnotic green eyes.  The first night he kept his distance, standing in the back of the crowd as we spoke about who we were and why we were there  to spread the teachings of the Sun God.  Though I tried to look at everyone in the crowd in turn, my eye was constantly drawn back to that man.  When we were done our introductions and headed toward the villages only inn for the night, Dolan was looking at me strangely.  I had no idea what could possibly be wrong, so I imagined he was just tired from our travels.

The next week went by pretty uneventfully.  Other than my blossoming friendship with Lucius, that is.  He would always meet up with Dolan and I in the evening.  Dolan would make some choked excuse and head off most times, but I happily stayed and talked to Lucius.  He told me all about his life, and how he came to be in this village.  Finally on Friday he confessed his feelings to me.  I was ecstatic!  I ran to tell Dolan that I thought it would be a good idea to invite Lucius to travel with us.  After all, Lucius had been extremely interested in us and our Sun God.  Lucius had even said that he was considering becoming a paladin as well!  I could be his sponsor!

Unfortunately, Dolan did not take the news so well.   He cried and screamed and begged, saying that he loved me, that I should be with him, and not to trust Lucius.  Dolan insisted that Lucius was hiding something.  I began to get angry as well.  I had told Dolan before that we were and would always be just friends.  That we could be nothing more.  I left the inn room after that and lingered downstairs in the common area for a while.  I never saw Dolan leave the room.

Sighing, I decided to head toward the clearing in the woods that we had come across before we entered the village with the idle thought of hoping that Lucius would show up.  That was probably foolish, because it was well past midnight, but sleep was going to be evading me for a while.  Maybe I would just sleep in the clearing itself

I knew something was wrong the moment the small clearing came into view.  The moonlight streaming down and filtering through the maple tree leaves seemed innocent enough, but I noticed that there were no sounds.  No scuttle of animal feet as they foraged for food.  No sweet music of crickets chirping.  Nothing.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for me.  Instinctively, my hand fell to my sword as I walked forward, fully on the defensive.

Slowly, I edged up to the clearing, but didnt quite enter it.  Crouching behind a rose bush, the scent filling my nostrils with a heady feeling, I saw Dolan standing over Lucius, Dolans sword drawn and dripping with Luciuss blood.  Gasping softly, I hesitated for only a moment as anger washed over me.  Before I could react, Dolan drew breath to speak.

You lied to her, and I will expose you for the villain that I know you to be, Lucius!  You may have blinded her, but not so with me!  I will show her the truth, and your terrible plotting will be revealed!  Dolan shouted.  Then muttering to himself, he said, And she will love me for it.

Chuckling softly, Lucius drew a deep breath, and a new light lit his eyes.  You are more of a fool than she is, you know.  You have no idea, absolutely no idea, what you are dealing with, do you, boy?
	
Dolan clenched his sword tighter and moved toward Lucius.  In a flash, I was on my feet and running toward my friends, pulling my sword out of its sheath as I neared the two.  Expertly, I parried Dolans downward slash and stood guard in front of Luciuss fallen form.  Behind me, Luciuss eyes glittered.  What in the Nine Hells are you doing, Dolan?  How could you go so far as to openly attack Lucius?  Are you so blinded by your own feelings that youd sink so low?  My voice was all steel.

Dolan stared into my face with disbelief.  Still, you doubt me?  You would protect thisthing, this abomination!  Why should I ever lie to you, Crystal?  I only want to keep you safe!  You know this is true.  You know how I feel  you know I love you!

Watching the moonlight fall on Dolans hair and face, something inside my stomach tightened and I faltered for a moment. Dolan, I began, my tone soft.  I  Behind me Lucius coughed feebly, and I snapped back to reality.

Lucius was going to die, unless I defended him.  The elf I loved was going to die, because of another mans jealousy.  No, Dolan.  Love is not this way.  You have it all wrong.  But I respected you, once, and because of that, I will give you one chance to walk away.  Just go.  Do not look back, and do not ever try to come into my life again.  I have made my choice, and I am happy.  If you cannot be happy for me, then it is time we went our separate ways.  I brought my sword to bear in front of me.  I have always been the better fighter, Dolan.  Please dont make me force you to go.  Please, just go for me.

Tears started streaming down Dolans face, and seeing them made me begin to cry as well, but my grip on my sword did not waver.  Eyes on the blade, Dolan took a step forward and extended his hand.  Crystal, take my hand, and we can go together.  Leave him, you dont need him.  Hes a *vampire*, the very personification of that which we strive to destroy.  Come back to me, and come back to the Sun God.  He took another step forward and gripped his sword tighter.  Lets take care of this together.

Tensing, I swore under my breath and took my own step forward, but what happened next is forever unclear in my mind.  The next thing I knew, my sword was plunging downward into Dolans chest.  Everything seemed to slow down in that instant.  Dolan was falling.  My hands slid from my sword and moved to catch him as he fell to the ground.  Dimly, I heard laughter  was that Lucius?  did he trip me?  no, of course not, thats just being silly.

Numbly, I fell to the ground beside Dolan, his warm blood colouring the ground, my hands, everywhere, it seemed.  Slowly, Dolan turned his head to me, and his fingertips brushed my face, leaving a small bloody trail in their wake.  Y-youare so stubborn.  Im s-sorry I couldnt keep you safe this time.  Im sorry I failed, Im sorry I love His hands fell from my face and his head fell back, vacant eyes staring at the uncaring moon.  Anguish unlike any I had ever known ripped through every pore in my body, every fiber of my being.  Even my wings felt too heavy to carry me away.  I nearly blacked out from the rending pain that coursed through my body.  Time passed weirdly, and I felt a cold hand on my shoulder.  My confused mind groped for an explanation.  Ah, Lucius.  My love, come to comfort me, to tell me it was not my fault, that everything was going to be okay.

It never gets old, you know.  It always gives me a new thrill to see it.  But I think this time was my favourite.  The hand moved to my face and wiped away Dolans blood from my cheek.  It was Luciuss hand, I noted.  Turning slightly, shifting Dolan to the ground, I stared.  Lucius licked the blood from his fingertips like a spoiled cat.  Well of course he was totally right, dear.  You really should listen to your friends more carefully.  And hey, I dont want you to think were not still friends.  Im pretty much all youve got in this world now, because I dont think your precious Sun God will want the likes of you back after a murder-

Accident.  My interrupting voice was level.  It was an accident.

Oh no, I saw it with my own two eyes in vivid, delicious colour.  You slaughtered him.  You took one step and drove your sword right on through him without even hesitating.  Definitely not an accident, my dear.  Lucius laughed cruelly.

My patriarch will hear me out, he will understand!  He will help me through this, he will!

Oh, I highly doubt hed want to see you right now, looking the way you do.  But I must say, those black wings are so much better than the way the used to be.  White was never really your colour, girl.

My wings?  I turned my head slightly and moved my left wing into my vision.  The tip of it was black, and it seemed that the stain was spreading upward at each passing moment.  I sobbed.

Well, now, dont think youre all alone in this.  I have plans for you, and so does someone else Id like you to meet.  Now, dont be all worried about this, Im pretty sure that you and my boss here will be the best of friends.  Lucius stared me dead in the eyes.  In fact, Id bet my eternal life on it.

Whimpering softly, I stared at the blood on my hands.  Lucius pulled a cloth from his back pocket and wrapped it around his hand.  Placing a foot on Dolans chest for leverage, he pulled out my sword and dropped it, steaming, onto the grass beside me.  Ill just take care of this for you, help you out here, okay?

Slowly I nodded, still unable to comprehend all that had happened.  Where did I have to turn?  Where else could I go?  Lucius was right  my Patriarch would be horrified at what had happened.  Even if it was an accident, clear as day, he wouldnt want to hear it, wouldnt want to listen.  No, there was no place for me in town any longer.  Better to go with Lucius, meet this boss of his.  Who knew what kind of Demon or Devil would be a vampires boss, butPerhaps he would take care of me.  Hide from the Sun.  The dark was safer.

It wasnt until years later that I realized how foolish and childish that hope was.  I killed my best friend, and lost my innocence all in one breathless minute.

	<TEXT> He was my best friend, and I killed him.  If Im to be honest, I must say the truth, even if it hurts.  I must give this confession now, before its too late.  Only the gods know when it will be too late.


Dolan was a blonde haired, blue eyed farm boy.  Me, Im a brunette, green eyed girl.  Back then my Soul was pure white.  We met each other by a stroke of luck.  We were both training to be entertainers.  We, along with several others, heard the call and decided that maybe the circus life might be for us.  Maybe its corny, but we enjoyed acting and doing stunts.  We were thrill seekers.


We made our way through our training with little problem.  We helped each other learn our acts, write our skits, and I helped Dolan master some more complex wordplay.  Comedy was never his strong suit.  His delivery time was awful.  After graduation, it was only natural that we decided to travel together and try to get famous doing our 2-man show of comedy and drama that wed perfected over the years wed been in school.  We figured wed try this before joining up with a huge organization.  Ah, youth.


And so it was, for several years.  In my eyes, we were just two best friends.  Nothing more.  I never saw that Dolan wanted more than this.  I never had a clue.  I guess I didnt know him as well as I thought I did.


Then came that fateful week.  We arrived just after dark to a small town by the side of a dusty, forgotten road.  It wasnt marked on our maps, but that didnt deter us.  After all, we enjoyed adventure.  We were welcomed by everyone with open arms, but one man in particular caught my attention.  When he and I made eye contact, I could feel an unfamiliar yet not unpleasant tingling all over my body.  I blushed faintly.  From the moment I saw him, I knew hed be something special to me.  


He had blonde hair so light it was almost white, pale skin, and hypnotic green eyes.  The first night he kept his distance, standing in the back of the crowd as we spoke about who we were and why we were there  to put on a little show in the park if we were able.  This town didnt get many visitors, so they were excited.  While speaking, I tried to look at everyone in the crowd in turn, but my eye was constantly drawn back to that man.  When we were done our introductions and headed toward the towns only inn for the night, Dolan was looking at me strangely.  I had no idea what could possibly be wrong, so I imagined he was just tired from our travels.


The next week went by pretty uneventfully.  Other than my blossoming friendship with Lucius, that is.  He would always meet up with Dolan and I in the evening.

Finally, on Friday he confessed his feelings to me.  I was ecstatic!  I ran to tell Dolan that I thought it would be a good idea to invite Lucius to travel with us.  After all, Lucius had been extremely interested in us and had previous acting experience.  I had seen a few newspaper clippings with his reviews, though they were all from this tiny towns theater.  Everyone starts somewhere, right?


Unfortunately, Dolan didnt take the news so well.   He cried and screamed and begged, saying that he loved me, that I should be with him, and not to trust Lucius.  Dolan insisted that Lucius was hiding something.  I began to get angry as well.  I had told Dolan before that we were and would always be just friends.  That we could be nothing more.  I left the inn room after that and lingered downstairs in the common area for a while.  I never saw Dolan leave.


Sighing, I decided to head toward the towns small park with the idle thought of hoping that Lucius would show up.  That was probably foolish, because it was well past midnight, but sleep was going to be evading me for a while.  Maybe I would just sleep in our old, dusty car


I knew something was wrong the moment the open field of the park came into view.  The moonlight streaming down and filtering through the maple tree leaves seemed innocent enough, but I noticed that there were no sounds.  No scuttle of animal feet as they foraged for food.  No sweet music of crickets chirping.  Nothing.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for me.  Almost of its own violation, my hand strayed to the small pocketknife I carried with me at all times.


Slowly, I edged up to the parks field, but didnt quite enter it.  Crouching behind a rose bush, the scent filling my nostrils with a heady feeling, I saw Dolan standing over Lucius, Dolans hands clenched into fists and dripping with Luciuss blood.  Gasping softly, I hesitated for only a moment as anger washed over me.  Before I could react, Dolan drew breath to speak.


You lied to her, and I will expose you for the villain that I know you to be, Lucius!  You may have blinded her, but not so with me!  I will show her the truth, and your terrible plotting will be revealed!  Dolan shouted.  Then muttering to himself, he said, And she will love me for it.

Dolan clenched his fists even tighter and moved toward Lucius.  In a flash, I was on my feet and running toward my friends, pulling my feeble pocketknife free as I neared the two.  I figured I was going to have to bluff my way through this.  I had no intention of actually using that dinky little blade.  I yelled as I ran at them, and came to stand guard in front of Luciuss fallen form.  Behind me, Luciuss eyes glittered.  What in the Nine Hells are you doing, Dolan?  How could you go so far as to openly attack Lucius?  Are you so blinded by your own feelings that youd sink so low?  My voice was all steel.


Dolan stared into my face with disbelief.  Still, you doubt me?  You would protect thisthing, this abomination!  Why should I ever lie to you, Crystal?  I only want to keep you safe!  You know this is true.  You know how I feel  you know I love you!


Watching the moonlight fall on Dolans hair and face, something inside my stomach tightened and I faltered for a moment. Dolan, I began, my tone soft.  I  Behind me Lucius coughed pathetically, and I snapped back to reality.


Lucius was going to die, unless I defended him.  The man I loved was going to die, because of another mans jealousy.  No, Dolan.  Love is not this way.  You have it all wrong.  But I respected you, once, and because of that, I will give you one chance to walk away.  Just go.  Dont look back, and dont ever try to come into my life again.  I have made my choice, and Im happy.  If you cant be happy for me, then its time we went our separate ways.  I brought my little knife in front of me.  Please dont make me force you to go.  Please, just go for me.


Tears started streaming down Dolans face, and seeing them made me begin to cry as well, but my hands holding the pocketknife didnt waiver.  Eyes on the blade, Dolan took a step forward and extended his hand.  Crystal, take my hand, and we can go together.  Leave him, you dont need him.  Hes a *vampire*, the very personification of darkness and vileness.  Come back to me, and come back to someone who loves you.  He took another step forward.  Lets take care of this together.


Tensing, I swore under my breath.  Was this an act?  Were Dolan and Lucius practicing a new skit for the show?  Had Dolan changed his mind?  Becausevampires arent real  I took a step forward meaning to give voice to my silent questions, but what happened next is forever unclear in my mind.  The next thing I knew, my pocketknife was plunging downward into Dolans chest.  Everything seemed to slow down in that instant.  Dolan was falling.  My hands slid from my hilt of the pocketknife and moved to catch him as he fell to the ground.  Dimly, I heard laughter  was that Lucius?  did he trip me?  no, of course not, thats just being silly.


Numbly, I fell to the ground beside Dolan, his warm blood colouring the dirt, my hands, everywhere, it seemed.  Slowly, Dolan turned his head to me, and his fingertips brushed my face, leaving a small bloody trail in their wake.  Y-youare so stubborn.  Im s-sorry I couldnt keep you safe this time.  Im sorry I failed, Im sorry I love His hands fell from my face and his head fell back, vacant eyes staring at the uncaring moon.  Anguish unlike any I had ever known ripped through every pore in my body, every fiber of my being.  There was no way; it shouldnt have been possible for such an insignificant blade to reach his heart.  I nearly blacked out from the rending pain that coursed through my body.  Time passed weirdly, and I felt a cold hand on my shoulder.  My confused mind groped for an explanation.  Ah, Lucius.  My love, come to comfort me, to tell me it was not my fault, that everything was going to be okay.


It never gets old, you know.  It always gives me a new thrill to see it.  But I think this time was my favourite.  The hand moved to my face and wiped away Dolans blood from my cheek.

You really should listen to your friends more carefully.  And hey, I dont want you to think were not still friends.  Im pretty much all youve got in this world now, because I dont think youve any friends or family leftor so I remember you telling me.  A strange girl in a strange townhow many folks will stand up for you when they learn about this murder-


Accident.  My interrupting voice was level.  It was an accident.


Oh no, I saw it with my own two eyes in vivid, delicious colour.  You slaughtered him.  You took one step and drove your pocketknife right on through him without even hesitating.  Jealous of his acting talents.  Definitely not an accident, my dear.  Lucius laughed cruelly.


The-the police will hear me out, they will understand!  They will help me through this, o-or a lawyer will!


Oh, I highly doubt that youd even be able to afford a decent enough lawyer for something like this.  And thats if you even get a trialthis being such a remote, small town.  They will take my word over anything you can say.  After all, Im the only witness, and Im from here.


I could feel my sanity slowly start ripping like a fragile fabric.  The world seemed to spin sideways, and I swayed on my feet.  I nearly passed out.


Well, now, dont think youre all alone in this.  I have plans for you, and so does someone else Id like you to meet.  Now, dont be all worried about this, Im pretty sure that you and my boss here will be the best of friends.  Lucius stared me dead in the eyes.  In fact, Id bet my eternal life on it.


Whimpering softly, I stared at the blood on my hands.  Lucius pulled a cloth from his back pocket and wrapped it around his hand.  Placing a foot on Dolans chest for leverage, he pulled out my pocketknife and dropped it, steaming, onto the grass beside me.  Ill just take care of this for you, help you out here, okay?


Slowly I nodded, still unable to comprehend all that had happened.  Where did I have to turn?  Where else could I go?  Lucius was right  small town mentality.  Id read about it.  I was screwed.  Even if it was an accident, clear as day, nobody wouldnt want to hear it, nobody would want to listen.  No, there was no place for me in town any longer.  Better to go with Lucius, meet this boss of his.  Who knew what kind of Demon or Devil would be a vampires boss, or what possible use he could have for me, butPerhaps he would take care of me.  Hide me.


It wasnt until years later that I realized how foolish and childish that hope was.  I killed my best friend, and lost my innocence all in one breathless minute. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's cheaper to drink at home, anyway ;)

If you want to catch up, it's not hard but will take a little bit of time.  However I'm not sure what the new patch will bring exactly.  I know dungeons will be retuned to give you more powerful gear, but that's all I know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, fellow old head!  First things first, you want to read /r/wownoob for any game questions you've got.

As far as coming back and buying Legion, if you have the spare cash, I say go for it.  I've been non-stop playing since 2008 and this is by FAR the best xpac.  Bonus?  There's a new Kara - it's a 5man!!  (I mention this b/c Kara will always be my fav raid ever; maybe it's the same for you as a fellow BC baby!)

If you have any questions, send me a message.  If you're US/Alliance I'd even be willing to do the things with you!  (Bonus if you're Korgath!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kind of agree with you.  I didn't realize this was a thing a couple weeks ago, b/c I'm never online on Tuesday mornings.  Queued for LFR and only did 1 boss; everyone left after that b/c there was only 5 min to a reset.  Didn't really hurt anything, but it was slightly annoying. </TEXT>

Hey, my job also pays crap which is why I figured, at least I can get paid crap from the comfort of my home lol.  Seriously considering being a stripper for the $ lolol .KiddingButNotReallyMaybe.
