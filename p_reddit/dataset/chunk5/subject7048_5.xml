	<TEXT> Even though Ziggs has good waveclear, he is still bad in this meta because it's so much tank-focused. He would have to be wayy ahead of his enemies to be able to do decent damage to the frontline.
About Xerath I really don't know, I also questioned about his possibility of appearing in future matches. He's a good pick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The verbal harassment was just a part of the problem. It's not that muting would prevent me from being kicked out of the match. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the warm support. I'm from another country tho (BR), and I don't know how Cs:go servers work. Maybe some good tutorials about map awareness and weapons recoil? That would help me a lot! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello guys, I've bought cs:go this week and started playing because of my friends, I'm currently lv2. I was having a lot of fun with the game and doing pretty well, until today. 

In the middle of a match, my team decided to kick me just because I wasn't doing well (my lv compared to the enemy team was really low). I clearly remember one of them saying: "Goodbye, trash" just before I got to the lobby. I closed the game immediately, feeling a bit guilty and worried. That really got me, and now I'm rethinking about keeping on with this game. Don't wanna be the crybaby, but how many times will I have to face this situation again, since this was just my third day playing? Those guys who kicked me were mostly veterans, and it's sad to see them using this kind of attitude with newcomers. Haven't the game teached them anything at all? Were they that good when they started playing?

Just a thing I wanted to say. You can take this post either seriously or just ignore, but thanks anyways.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe decreasing the timers to select the bans and champions, making a better system to find players faster in queue... Those little things could improve the pacing a lot, they would just need some researching to see if fits. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Who agrees Riot should focus on a faster draft/match finder for next season? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-25 19:44:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Draft just takes so much time, and plus the loading screen, it's about 5-7 minutes. Taking about 2 minutes to find a game, it's almost 9 minutes that I have to wait for every match to start.
People normally wouldn't complain since we are faced with this system for 5 years now, but thinking out of the box, that would save so much time of our lives and we would get to play wayy more games in a single day.
Riot said they were focusing on an enchanced draft screen, so I really hope they are considering a fast paced draft.
