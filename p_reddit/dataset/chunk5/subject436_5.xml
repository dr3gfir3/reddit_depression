	<TEXT> Interestingly enough, one of the listed authors - Camilla L. Lisanti - is an eight-year-old girl! 

She's the one who first had the idea of treating cancer patients with antibiotics *http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-01/uom-scp012715.php

*http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150128081957.htm

Also, this study was done *in vitro* only; they'll need *in vivo* studies, and then clinical studies before to know for sure if/how well it's working.

 (4) This is a study strictly about Paxil, and not about just any antidepressant.

 (5) Title should be: Exposure to THIS PARTICULAR antidepressant in womb AND in youth can cause lifetime decline in sexual behavior, body weight, and competitive ability. 

Because the mice were given Paxil when they were in womb, AND THEY CONTINUED to receive Paxil until they reached adulthood. That is a really long run of Paxil!

And of course it can cause decline in sexual behavior. Paxil's adverse effects on the long run are well known; sexual dysfunction is one of the most common https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adverse_effects_of_paroxetine

In the community, alcohol consumption of up to 7 drinks/week at early-middle age is associated with lower risk for future HF, with a similar but less definite association in women than in men. These findings suggest that despite the dangers of heavy drinking, modest alcohol consumption in early-middle age may be associated with a lower risk for HF.
