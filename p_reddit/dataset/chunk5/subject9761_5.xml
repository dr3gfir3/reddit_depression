	<TEXT> Quote from the Mans brother "So this is what you get. And no it's not gonna stop today. I can't tell you it's going to stop tomorrow. I don't know when it's going to end. But it's up to y'all to start. We're not the  one's killin' us. We can't make a change if y'all don't change."

	<TEXT> Love the app; having the following issues and am curious if anyone else is.

a) Just installed the app on my Win10 computer. The app launches but when I click the login using Facebook button, the facebook login comes up for like 2 secs then goes to "We can't connect to the service you need right now. Check your network connection or try this again later." Network connection is fine. But I don't have the facebook app installed on my comp. Thoughts?

b) I've been using the app on my windows phone 8.1 (I have a lumia 1020) for a few months. Although I am very selective and swipe right only 5% of the time, I've never matched with anyone. Could this be the app? If not its likely I'm just not good at tinder :/

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Problems with ESPN app? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm having some trouble with my ESPN app and I'm wondering if anyone else is having this issue or has had this issue.

About a week ago the scores just wouldn't load. I had connectivity and I tried on WiFi but nothing. So I logged out and tried to log back in. I clicked the log-in button and it goes to a white screen. I hit back and try again. Same thing. So I click the button that says Sign Up Later and it takes me right into the scores, no problem. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and had the same issue. I've tried multiple times a day since then and still nothing. 

Anybody else experiencing this? I have a Lumia 1020 that unfortunately I can't upgrade past 8.1.

Thanks!

	<TEXT> Question: When in the woods, can I just fling the dog poo off into the woods off the trail? It's biodegradable right? Otherwise, my dog takes a shit at the trailhead and now I've got a pocket full of poo on my 2 hour hike. I have not taken my dog with me on hikes for this reason. Actually, I don't take my dog anywhere because I don't want a pocket of poo. Dog parks are fine if they have a trash bin or other poo receptacle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just remembered I stopped at a truck stop somewhere on the way to Memphis a few years ago. The subway there was SPECTACULAR. They were fast, clean, generous, and had their own deals (I think we got 2 footlongs for like $7). The line was long, but MOVING, which seems to be a struggle at many establishments.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did cause... I dunno in the moment it was like...well i guess im eating a shit lunch today. I haven't been back since. That was the last straw. I have meetings on both sides of campus so it was the more convenient one at times, but now, it's just not worth it.

I'm not sure how they burnt it if there was a timer. Maybe they put it in for the wrong time because they were being careless? The owner was right there too running the cash register. Or at least I thought he was was the owner. He was ordering people around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's two subways near my campus, one on either side. One is run by cheap-o fucktards that won't honor subway specials and don't clean their bins. I've seen mold multiple times. They'll try to get away with skimping on meat and fixins. Once they burnt my sandwich in the oven and wouldn't make me a new one. I wasn't even a dick about it, was just like, "uh the bread is more black than brown and the cheese is all black". The response was, "well you wanted it toasted."

Then there's the good one run by a nice mom and pop indian couple. They are on point with everything. Everything is always fresh. They run the nationwide deals. If there's ever an issue they go way out of their way to rectify. Example: The self serve soda machine was out of lemonade. They refunded my combo and immediately replaced the lemonade in the machine so I could get some. I wouldn't let them refund my combo.

Needless to say, I only go to one subway now. But I'm under the impression Subways can differ from location to location. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So here's part of my problem, I like it cold. I keep the thermostat at about 74 F, and I still feel hot so I have the ceiling fans going. But in the winter I barely use the heat.

I do keep the AC off pretty much every day when I'm at work 9am-5pm,  if I remember to flip the switch. This is when a web programmable thermostat would come in handy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alrighty then. Next time I see dimmable LEDs on sale I'm gonna buy a bunch. Thanks!

As a side note regarding replacing the bulbs, someone in my neighborhood replaced all of his bulbs with LEDs and gave away all of his CFLs for free. So now I have about 70 CFLs, most of which are still in the package. I should never need to buy light bulbs again! I know /r/frugal would love that story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone have any experiences with power co-ops? I've always been suspicious because it sounds too good to be true. A door-to-door salesmen telling me he can reduce my power bill by just signing up always sounded way too fishy to be the whole truth. A friend recommended I look into it. I'd be worried about things like, random price hikes 2 years down the road, service if the power goes out, what happens if the co-op goes out of business... maybe I'm just paranoid? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My TV already takes forever to turn on...
But seriously this is a great idea. Everything is already plugged into a power strip, I should just get in the habit of turning off the power strip too.

And the water heater is gas and I have it turned way down to save on the gas bill. But good idea!

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did hand washing for about 6 months then installed a dishwasher. Saved me about $25 per quarter on my water bill. Since I only run the dishwasher about once a week I think I'm coming out ahead, but I'd have to check the actual power usage on the machine.

I looked into solar. Solar City said I'd have to have 2 massive trees removed, one of which isn't even on my property. :(

I'm going to investigate the household dryer usage. I may switch to a clothesline for the summer months. Thanks for the advice.

	<TITLE> How to reduce my electric bill? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-08 22:27:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello r/frugal.

I was hoping to get some advice on reducing my electric bill. It's summertime(in the USA anyway) and I've got my air conditioner pumping so naturally my electric bill has sky rocketed. But even before that, my average bill and usage is almost double what the electric company deems as "standard."

It's a relatively small 4 br house with two people. The major energy users should be:

* 1 AC unit 
* 1 Refrigerator 
* 1 dishwasher
* 3 computers(average 400W PS)
* 2 TVs(45" and 55")
* 1 Microwave(I think it's a 1200W nuclear reactor)
* 1 toaster oven
* 1 Washing Machine
* 1 Dryer
* about 35 light fixtures, half of which have CFLs, the other half are on dimmers and need to be incandescent
* 2 Ceiling fans

I've got gas heat and stove, so that's not an issue. The electric company has an energy saving box attached to my AC unit which is supposed to make the fans cycle and keep the actual AC off on specific days of the year.

So far these are my ideas to help save money, but I'm not sure how much impact they will truly have:

* Programmable thermostat
* Attic exhaust vent(do these work?)

That's it. I'm probably going to go around the house and note how much wattage ever item in my house pulls and try to add them up and see if it's close to the 1300kW im using in a month. Is it possible there's a "leak"? Can an electrician do a power audit of sorts?

Any advice would be great.

Thanks.
