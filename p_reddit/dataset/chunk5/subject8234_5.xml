	<TEXT> John Watson worked at John Hopkins at the time of the experiment. No one ever had records from him because before he died, he burned all of his records and said that "when a person dies, all of them should die." That was weird but no one really knew anything else. 

Anyway, back in 2010, I believe, a group of undergrad students in a class taught by Hall Beck asked him what happened to little Albert- he told them no one knew, but if they wanted, he could help them find out. 

The students did research and found out what happened. 

When Watson was at John Hopkins, there was a wet nurse(nurse who breastfed infants) working there, the mother of little Albert. She had her child out of wedlock and was a wet nurse- she would've had a low social status, enough that Watson easily could've goaded her into letting him experiment on Albert. 

 Turns out his name wasn't Albert. It was Douglas Merritte. (I forget his mothers name) Turns out, Douglas died at the age of 6 from hydrocephalus, caused by meningitis. They suspect that Douglas, early on, had been intentionally infected via spinal taps by researchers. At the time of the experiments by Watson, he was nearly blind and deaf, and had major problems with his learning capabilities. This child must've had a horrible childhood. 

In the original paper by Watson, he says that "they chose the child because he was a completely normal, healthy, happy child." At the end of the paper, he explains that they did not extinguish the conditioning in Douglas because his mother stopped their experiments. Watson basically intended on molesting the boy to extinguish the behaviors. If you don't believe me, look in the paper. It's there. Last paragraph. 

There's one other thing. Watson knew a publisher. He wanted his work published, so he lied about his work being peer reviewed and edited. He did it all himself, without any help from anyone else. This is why peer review is so important today. 

The IRB and ethics boards today were formed to keep this kind of unethical study from ever happening.  It kills me to know that something like this was allowed to happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're a psychology student, you've heard of John Watson and little Albert. Turns out he  had some secrets he didn't want getting out that came out with the help of some undergrad students a few years ago. 

The things Watson did in that study could never be done again. Blows my mind that he was used as a standard for so many years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Talk with people in the field. Go to your professors, find out about their research. Go to professional conferences. Find out what you're passionate about and whether you're actually into the field or not. 

I was where you are three years ago. I'm in college now as a psychology major and I love it. I'm the happiest I ever have been in school. I went to the Midwestern psychological association meeting in Chicago recently and found out what topics I'm passionate about and those topics have spurred me into research projects that will probably carry me through until I graduate. 

The one thing you need to be certain of is your passion for the field. This is your career- if you're not happy now, you probably won't be later on.  It's a long, tough road but if you have a passion for the work you'll make it. 

I hope I'm not coming off as condescending- if I am, that is not my intention. I just had someone tell me this in the past- I just wanted to do the same thing and I'm hoping it'll help you like it helped me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My uncle got into a bar fight with a couple of guys while drunk. From what he says, a guy was threatening him and beating him pretty badly so he ran to his car to get his gun, there was a scuffle, and the other guy died. He said the other guy had a gun and pulled it, so he shot first. He's in for life without parole in the state pen because they couldn't find the gun he said the other guy had. 

Family reacted badly. For months things were in chaos. 

Still pisses me off that he did that and left his wife and kids on the outside. 

On the upside, he's not an alcoholic anymore. 

Now, it's sad, but we go and see him every chance we get. The prison he's at is really good about visitation. Rest of the family has accepted it as best they can, I suppose. 

We never saw it coming.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the best on campus happens to be in the basement at the office I work at. I have keys to the building, so I just go there whenever I need to. Hardly anyone uses it so I get some quality redditing done at work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be part of a crazy fundamentalist church. 

Then I realized that I have had no relationship with a deity of any kind ever. 

I stopped trying. I'm ok with risking going to hell for not going to church. 

I only hope that I'm judged, if I am, based on the merits of my actions rather than church attendance. 

Life is much easier now that I don't have to deal with crazy religious drama.  </TEXT>
