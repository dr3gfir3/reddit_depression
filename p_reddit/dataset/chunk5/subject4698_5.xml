	<TEXT> I think late to the game characters need that kind of treatment.

If you think about League of Legends - compare Annie (released day 1) to something like Lee Sin, Thresh or any other new champion.  There are so many mechanics involved in new companions, a) because people need innovation in their games to remain interested and b) because those mechanics have already been introduced in characters available before hand.  Imagine if every champion they released had the same 'kit' as Annie, or Ashe, or any other character with simple mechanics.  The game wouldn't last. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) You didn't watch the entire video.

2) And if that was their intention, would you still blindly defend them?  And of course that is the reason subscription services exist.  Go work for corporate America in marketing, as I did after getting my MBA, and you'll find all about that.  Everything in business - video games is a business remind you - is designed to take as much money as they possibly can from you, while holding on to your loyalty in the process.  

Why do you think yearly sub services are broken down into monthly payments?  Think about it.

Andrew Wilson isn't your friend, he's the CEO of a corporation with thousands of employees and shareholders to appease.  He's out to be profitable...not be your friend.

You, me, everyone...we should all be concerned with this kind of stuff.  Controversy is a good thing to argue about.

	<TEXT> I am a Youtuber myself (not a small one, I may add), and let me speak for all of the press by saying that it is an incredibly sensitive medium to present reviews of products.  Games are very personal, people take them way too personally - when is ever okay to tell someone to go hang themself, or that their parents should die in a fire just because they said the game wasn't a '10/10?'

The behavior of people is sickening, to say at least.  Other people take it better, but in the end it's all about the objectivity of the reviewer.  People can sense when people are fake, when their is obvious sponsorship bias on a video, and when the press is pandering to the mob on Youtube by raging about a video game simply because people want to hear it.

In the end, we don't have control over what people feel about games.  A lot of them are prediposed to like or hate a game before they know anything about it, it's called fanboyism.  You can't get away from it.

For everyone else who hops onto reviews and maturely discusses the good and bad of a game in an objective stance (which is what I try to do to)...than I applaud that.
