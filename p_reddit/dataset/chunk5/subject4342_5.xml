With this new direction, existing tools and plugins dependent on the Java class file format should continue to work.

For those that don't want to click:

 Meitu told CNET in a statement that the data collection code was included because the company is headquartered in China, where tracking services provided by app stores such as the Apple App Store and Google Play are blocked.

 "To get around this, Meitu employs a combination of third-party and in-house data tracking systems to make sure the user data tracked is consistent," said a Meitu spokesperson.

 The check also ensures that ads are tracked properly, as well as for protection against illegal API usage, said Meitu's spokesperson. MAC addresses and IMEI numbers are also combined into a unique ID for internal tracking purposes.

	<TEXT> Not necessarily. A hardware revision means they changed something about the design, like they did when adding the small nubs to the back of the Nexus 4. In the Pixel's case, it seems like they solely focused on the manufacturing aspect, without changing any of the components within the phone. I assume this could be something like tweaking the machinery, revising some processes, and improving quality control. 

Also, they could have done a revision, but are spinning it a bit to make it seem like it's not a bit change in order to avoid upsetting current owners. That said, hardware revisions are nothing new when it comes to consumer electronics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unconfirmed, but below is the reason given:

 The optical fingerprint recognition technology is still nascent and the report claims that Samsung and its fingerprint sensor supplier Synaptics were running out of time. Even though Samsung poured resources into Synaptics nascent technology last year, the results were frustrating.

 The company had to make a decision as it had to start mass production of the Galaxy S8. It made a last minute decision to relocate the fingerprint sensor to the back. Samsung reportedly tried its best to have an embedded fingerprint sensor in the Galaxy S8s display but Synaptics was unable to develop the technology on time. </TEXT>

Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charging is pretty much the same as QC 2.0. As [AC noted last year](http://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s7-and-s7-edge-only-support-quick-charge-20-coming-short-latest-standard), they're probably going this route due to the phone shipping with two different processors. Also, given the Note 7 situation, adopting a faster charging standard likely wasn't a priority.

Edit: just noticed that unfortunate title error :( </TEXT>

 Privacy Shade will let you read emails, messages and personal content at any time without worrying about snoopers, even if someone is looking over your shoulder. The app allows you to view private information in public places  like on the train or in a restaurant  by obscuring the parts of the screen that youre not actively viewing or using, while still allowing you to interact with the obscured parts.

 Privacy Shade lets you adjust the transparency of the filter to suit the surroundings. Another feature is quick access to Privacy Shade in four ways:

 * If you are using Android OS 7.0 Nougat or higher, you can add BlackBerry Privacy Shade to your Quick Settings.
 * If you are using a BlackBerry device with a Convenience Key, you can assign BlackBerry Privacy Shade to the Convenience Key.
 * If you are using a BlackBerry device that supports Swipe Shortcuts, you make BlackBerry Privacy Shade one of your shortcuts.
 * Regardless of what Android device youre using, you can also toggle BlackBerry Privacy Shade on or off via an optional dedicated notification in the notification tray. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Our brand new Android app lets you instantly see which apps are wasting your data, acting suspiciously, slowing your phones Internet speed, or causing you to go over your carrier data limits. GlassWire for Android makes it easy to keep track of your mobile carrier data usage and WiFi Internet activity.

 Key features:

* See a live graph of what apps are currently using your carrier data, or slowing your Internet connection.
* Instantly know every time a new app accesses the network and begins using your data.
* Go back in time with GlassWires graph to see what apps wasted your data earlier in the week or month.
* GlassWires data alerts help keep you under your data limit. Get alerted before you reach your carrier data limit to avoid costly overage fees.
* GlassWire reveals unusual network activity from unknown apps or malware that could be violating your privacy or spying on you.
* GlassWire counts your mobile carrier data (Edge, 3G, 46, 5G, LTE, CDMA, UMTS, GSM, GPRS, mobile hotspots) and shows you detailed usage statistics on GlassWires Usage screen, along with your WiFi data. See your mobile phone provider data for AT T, Verizon, Sprint, T-mobile, Virgin, Vodafone, Orange, EE, 3, Swisscom, Telia, Movistar, O2, and all others.
* See data usage for different apps like Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Pokemon Go, Netflix, Youtube, Instagram, Pandora, Spotify, Pinterest, Whatsapp, Skype, Kik, and any other apps you use. </TEXT>

The first post, [seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5xztcb/more_leaked_pictures_of_the_galaxy_s8_and_galaxy/), was removed for "blog spam" even though it's the direct source.

Since Android Central got these photos from Slashleaks, shouldn't this be considered rehosted content? I would love for a mod to explain this since I have gotten no response through messaging.

	<TEXT>  investors shouldn't consider Xiaomi's announcement to be a major blow to Qualcomm on its own. Nonetheless, the overall trend is worrisome, because it indicates that Qualcomm's chipmaking business -- which posted flat year-over-year sales growth last quarter -- will likely continue ceding market share to first-party ARM chips for the foreseeable future.  

It'll be interesting to see how many other manufacturers switch to making their own chips. With TI and NVIDIA having exited the game a while back, I'm all for other manufacturers stepping up to give Qualcomm competition.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The twitter source does state "film+S8." I'm wondering if that means there's a screen protector over the S8 and that is just showing much more cutouts than normal.

For reference, the Note 7 only had 3 noticeable sensor/camera cutouts. However, as [seen here](http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/83785-image/Best-Galaxy-Note-7-plastic-film-and-tempered-glass-screen-protectors.jpg), screen protectors need to provide more cutouts for the other sensors that aren't easy to spot. Something like this has already been shown for the S8, [product seen here](http://static.trustedreviews.com/94/00003ce44/0ad1_orh370w630/s8-case.png). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder if the limited carrier release had to do with Google expecting there to be supply issues. If they're having issues keeping them in stock with just Verizon as a carrier partner, I can only imagine the stock issues would've been much worse had it seen distribution through more carriers. Hopefully production supply kinks are straightened out by the time the second gen Pixel gets released.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the latest updated to their [article](https://9to5google.com/2017/01/26/source-google-pixel-2-camera-chipset-waterproof-budget-price-details/):

 Heres the full text of what we were told:

 You should interpret Budget Pixel as a device that is being developed by the same team working on the Pixel 2, that is aimed at being released in emerging markets. This could mean Android One, this could mean something entirely different. My knowledge of this device is that: a.) its being developed alongside the Pixel 2 and b.) **will not be sold in the US (assuming that it leaves the prototype stages)**.

(emphasis mine) </TEXT>
