	<TEXT> The gold around my finger pulls me deeper than an anchor.

My lover's name is Sebastian, and God granted him the sort of looks people spent millions trying to recreate in silicon and plastic. His face is peerless, with a wide smiling mouth and big aquamarine blue eyes. I wake up every morning to that mouth upon my forehead, those big eyes staring down upon me, and a limber body curled beside my own.

Idyllic, people would say with laughter and jealousy. They would not understand why I did what I did. They would not understand what it means to love someone like Sebastian. This is what I will tell you.

Before I worked homicide, I worked sex crimes. I found it draining, like a leech upon my back  at least in homicide, the victim is not staring at you from a hospital bed, stumbling through how their boyfriend held them down in the back of a car. At least in homicide the prosecutor isn't asking me what the girl was wearing, like she somehow deserved her fate. At least in homicide, the victim is dead and gone and free and that seemed like a better destiny than some of the shit I saw.

This is where I met Sebastian.

This happens more often than you'd think, but you'd fluff it up, try to wait until the case was fully closed, and say you ran into each other later. Some guys have a hero complex, obsessed with the idea of protecting someone terrified and vulnerable. I always said that I wasn't going to pick someone up at a crime scene. I was, and always am, a fucking liar.

I pulled up to ambulance flashing and beat cops taping off the front of a cute little house, the big bay window up front completely smashed in. Point of entry automatically established, I went to go find my victim sitting in the ambulance.

Even here, huddled underneath a bright orange shock blanket with only the streetlamps for lighting, Sebastian seemed to glow from the inside out. There were freckles across his aristocratic nose, and his legs were long and covered in bruises. I slapped myself for noticing when there were thick tears still dripping down his face.

"Hey, are you Sebastian?" I asked kindly. He looked up at me with those jewel blue peepers. "I'm Detective Anthony Capri. Can you tell me what happened?"

"I was...I was just in my kitchen, making dinner," Sebastian murmured. He spoke like birdsong, sugar sweet trills that would lull me awake on my mornings off. "I heard shattering glass from my living room, and when I came out to see what broke, he...he..."

Sebastian broke off. I placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, and Sebastian looked up at me with pleading adoration. I was used to a bit of hero worship, my towering frame and square-cut jaw filling the role of Knight in Shining Armor easily.

"He pinned me down and tried to..." Sebastian said. It was oftentimes difficult for male victims to fully articulate what happened to them, too ashamed to admit weakness. "But the cops came before he could..."

"It's alright," I assured. "Do you think it was someone you know?"

Sebastian looked down, before casting a baleful look at me through his lashes. "I have an ex-boyfriend. He was very...violent."

Sebastian, of course, came down to the station on multiple occasions, to give an official witness statement and sit with the police sketch artist and talk about his violent ex-boyfriend. I was always there, as the lead detective on the case, and Sebastian  bright and vivacious and playful  would smile and say that he found my presence comforting. I made him feel safe and secure, even as we struggled to locate his ex-boyfriend.

I was there when he opened the threatening note taped to his door, written in the ex's shattered scrawl, and I held Sebastian as he sobbed into my chest.

"I don't think I'll ever be free of him," Sebastian confessed. "He's going to always find me and...and..."

"You can stay at my place tonight," I said, without thinking. Unprofessional, like those cops with victim fetishes and hero complexes. I stroked Sebastian's soft hair, and he looked up at me with unfettered adoration.

My bachelor pad, a two story house that backed up on to some woods out on the edge of town, was transformed by Sebastian's presence. Instead of frozen pizzas he made me steak; instead of silence, he dragged out my old record collection and made me dance with him. I was still laughing when he pressed me down on to the couch, and he trilled like a little bird when we made love on my lonely bed. I curled around him like a bulletproof vest, his fine-boned fingers stretched across my ribs, and I had never felt more wanted.

"What if every night was like this one?" he asked me. "How wonderful would it be?"

No part of me could disagree with him, and I fell asleep in love.

I woke up to shattering glass and Sebastian not coddled in my arms, and was immediately on the offensive. I pulled on my pants and grabbed my service weapon, making my way downstairs. The huge floodlights at the front of my house made eerie silhouettes of the living room. Sebastian stood there naked with his ex-boyfriend kneeling with his head against Sebastian's knees, strange shadow puppets in the washed-out dark. The stranger was crying.

Sebastian turned to me, eyes so bright, and said, "He won't let me go."

I don't know why I did what I did. What possessed me to put my gun between this man's eyes and pull the trigger, splattering his brain across my wall. Why I went and dragged that body into the woods, burying it in a shallow grave for the scavengers to pick over and for the wind to scatter the bones. Why I let Sebastian kiss me when I came back, a smile upon his mouth.

"I knew you were the right one for me," Sebastian whispered to me, and it was like a wedding vow.

I still see the man's shadow when I drink my morning coffee, a stranger among the trees. Sebastian walks around our kitchen, chattering about surrogate candidates and filling our home with blue-eyed, silver-tongued babies as beautiful as he is. Between us is a secret heavier than lead and more binding than gold.

Sometimes I wonder who got the better destiny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much! It'll definitely take a lot more than this to get me to stop :) After I got over my initial anger, it was pretty funny actually (he fucked the formatting up *so bad.*) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you write pretty murderous girls, I will answer with pretty murderous boys.

Let me tell you, it was fucking surreal to see it. I knew that it was mine and those words were words I picked out very carefully, but the formatting was making my brain go ERROR ERROR. Let it be a lesson to all that formatting really does matter.

EDIT: Lol, saw that. They did change "pretty boy" to "pretty girl." I can't get over "Laurent" to "Sierra," though. They didn't even pick a French name, when the character and his father were clearly French. </TEXT>
