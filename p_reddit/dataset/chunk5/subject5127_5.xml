	<TEXT> What do you make of [recent research](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/antibiotics-given-early-in-life-may-have-lasting-negative-effects) suggesting that antibiotics early in childhood might have lasting negative effects on things like brain development, gut microbes, and social behavior? This seems very preliminary (I think just documented in mice so far), but still very troubling.

I know you specialize more in viruses and vaccines, but this seems very reminiscent of concerns about vaccines.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  21st century medicine might be era of the gut biome. Because it seems to have a hand in a lot of stuff. 

Agreed 100%. I think figuring out which bacterial compositions do what may be as big for medicine as figuring out "germs" exist in the first place.  </TEXT>
