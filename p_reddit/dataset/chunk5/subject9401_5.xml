	<TEXT> Also I understand that it's the same as ME1   ME3, thought they'd want to push envelope on races to represent/expand on. Shit the Drell race seemed really interesting. 

The games weren't just explosions in space. It was a giant space opera dealing with a variety of aliens trying to get along/survive/advance.

	<TEXT> Wow thanks for all the response!

1) I understand it's actually the 'same' as ME1   ME3, I guess I'm biased because I enjoyed building the larger team in ME2.

2) Some my hesitation I think comes from exploring a whole new system and only one new race to represent that to be apart of squad. It felt more encompassing to have races from that system be apart of team.

3) No Salarian teammate! Mordin Solus was my favorite squad bro. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So it seems super limited on number of different squadmates. 6? Heck we had like 12 for Mass Effect 2. 

Anyone know if there's more than 6?

EDIT: 
If you look later on in this post, I bring up the squad situation being less about flat numbers but variety etc. </TEXT>
