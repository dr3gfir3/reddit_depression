Other than that I also got my first 10K egg with level 21 and some people claim that a thing called RNG is to blame if someone does get almost no 10K's but I know nothing about programming so Idk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This tuorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56N5JYaJBi4) from Pig Art helped me alot. 

I gotta confess though, that I have been really lucky. The waterfall I made got really messed up as soon as I added the "Discard" modyfier but it still looks ok in the rendered image. There are many other things that bother me and I still have a lot to learn about blender, but I am quite happy that I was able after 15 hours of copying tutorials to create something like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never had Carnivorous Plants before. How do I keep them Alive. How much light do they need? Can I just use Rainwater for Irrigation? How ofter do they need to be Irrigated? Should I replant these two soon?

The Sundew should be slightly red, is that true? I think that especially the Sundew is not in the best condition.

I live in Austria. Right now its raining frequently and has about 10  Celsius ( 50  Fahrenheit) Should I put them outside? The humidity in my House is i guess not good for these plants.  </TEXT>
