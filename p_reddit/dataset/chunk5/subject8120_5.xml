	<TEXT> Just a psa for commissioners. ... Dave and busters will essentially give you a private room for draft parties... plus a draft board. All that is required is that your party spends over 100 dollars the entire night.

Little incentive for commissioners is that you get a 25 dollar gift card in addition to the room for your league. 

They just opened up sign ups for dates last week and I've scheduled mine already.. Hope this helps someone.  </TEXT>

Probably not possible since they have it locked down but these ports should be opened as well.
Xbox Live requires the following ports to be open:

Port 88 (UDP)
Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)
Port 53 (UDP and TCP)
Port 80 (TCP)
Port 500 (UDP)
UDP Port 3544 (UDP)

	<TEXT> I'm being optimistic...

I honestly would never use those two players ever this year.. especially in the playoffs. So might as well have the #3 overall scoring QB on my team as well.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Need help pressing the accept button...

Some guy offered me Aaron Rodgers for Percy Harvin and MJD...

I'm 8-2 with playoffs pretty much in grasp by one more win.

I've got McCoy, Reggie Bush, and Leveon bell as RB. I have Jordy, Marshall, and Garcon as WR

I for some reason need to be told to do this... I've got Romo as QB now. </TEXT>
