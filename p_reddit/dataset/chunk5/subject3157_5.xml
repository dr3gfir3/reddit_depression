	<TEXT> I preferred not to cook the chicken on skewers because since the chicken is cut into smaller pieces it dries out quicker once cooked. A whole boneless drumstick retains more juices.

I did marinade it for at least an hour in the below ingredients.

4 tablespoons coconut milk (from a 400ml tin)
1 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar
1 tablespoon Thai red curry paste
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
Pinch of salt
4 skinless chicken thighs, bone-in </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep Thai chicken satay, Chose to use boneless drumsticks instead of chicken breast on a skewer just for the fact that I find it juicier and tastier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The chicken was marinated in Satay mixture and then I drizzled The satay sauce that i made onto it. I guess that qualifies as Satay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep used beschamel to make it creamier because the pesto itself would not be enough sauce.

Make pesto (Garlic,basil,Chilli, Parmesan,olive oil, pine nuts)
Fried the chorizo and pancetta and removed the excess fat.
Fried onions.
Then I just layered everything out. Pesto,chorizo, pancetta, tomatoes, onions, beschamel, lasagna sheets </TEXT>
