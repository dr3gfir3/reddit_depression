	<TEXT> It will be interesting to see what exactly this allows and disallows.  If you stop someone for a violation, and they have a warrant, you're basically being ordered by a judge to arrest that person and bring them to court.

If you run someone out, and find out they're on probation or parole, does this mean you cannot do probation compliance checks?  What about DUI with drugs or alcohol?  What about plain view? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I mean, okay? You never had to give the police your ID to begin with, you could just say no. Can they still demand ID for like reports and traffic stops?

The US Supreme Court has ruled no one has to answer identifying questions.  There's also local state laws that have been overturned that previously required presenting ID to an officer during some, but not all, encounters.

For example, California law states you MUST *PRESENT FOR INSPECTION* a valid driver's license if you are stopped for vehicle code violations.  Failure to sufficiently identify yourself during a cite-release/ticket incident falls under CA Vehicle Sections 12951 and CVC 40302.

If a police officer talks to someone and has no legal authority to detain them or arrest them, the subject/suspect in question has no legal requirement to identify themselves.  However, intentionally providing false information does become a crimes, so it's best to just say nothing or, "I decline to identify myself" (or something similar).

Correct... But there are mechanisms in place to review and overturn laws.  Rampant disregard for laws in general is not the most appropriate way to "protest" unjust laws. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They are not manipulated.

Crime statistics are reported by police departments to city council, the public, researchers, etc.  When I say stats can be manipulated, the easiest way would be to classify certain things either as no crime, or a more minor crime that it really is.  For example, there's a local police department near me that's being accused of doing it pretty routinely.  

For example, shooting into a house that people live in, whether or not they are home, is a violation of California Penal Code 246, and is a felony.  The police department in question has been accused of reclassifying this as a misdemeanor negligent discharge of a firearm (CA PC 246.3) if they either a) believe no one was home at the time, or b) do not have anyone that can corroborate an allegation the house was shot intentionally (even if the house was shot multiple times).

There are a lot of other ways to reduce crime stats as well... So my assertion that "stats can be manipulated" is because I have seen first hand that it does happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Correct me if I'm wrong but I'd imagine areas with dispensaries are being policed to avoid a rise in other drugs being sold. Nobody wants an open drug market.  If that is the case, do you really think homeless people will congregate in those areas just because weed is available ? 

This is not necessarily true.  Many of the "upper class" cities near me enacted strict "no medicinal marijuana dispensary" city ordinances as a proactive/preventative measure.  As such, they do not have the issues I'm inquiring about.

On the flip side, I've worked street patrol in some of our lower socioeconomic cities (aka the 'hood).  While there are some legal medicinal dispensaries in these areas, there is also a "normal" black market for drugs, including marijuana.

The other thing that seems to hold true is there are more homeless people living in the "hood" areas, or the lower socioeconomic areas.  Again, this could be due to the fact much of our US law enforcement budget stems from property taxes, and lower property taxes means lower budgets for law enforcement (among other things), which leads to less police presence.  Also, the "homeless problem" is more ignored in these areas because there are other, higher priority, crimes being committed...


Do you think homeless people will travel there because of this availability 

SOme of them do.  I've encountered many homeless/transient people in my small areas who have come from all over.  Some had drug abuse problems before they arrived, but not all.  Many of those who did stated they wanted to find cheaper, more readily accessible drugs.  Some moved to get away, but ended up in an area with an incredibly high supply of drugs.

do you think they are actually using the dispensaries ? In Ireland we have a massive issue with homelessness and heroin and obviously there are correlations between habitual drug addicts and marijuana use but here weed is much more expensive and probably not the first thing a drug addict is going to go spend money on.

I work in a large (both geographically and density) county.  SOme of our cities have a lot of money.  Some are incredibly low income areas.  The higher echelon areas have different drug abuse/addiction problems.  Many teenagers in the well-to-do areas think it's fun to have "Pharm" parties, and they steal prescription drugs from their parents.

Many get addicted to prescription narcotic medications either through sports injuries, or because their parents had them, adn they stole them.  Once they can no longer get their legal supply of prescription narcotic medications (frequently Oxycodone), they purchase those narcotic medications on the street.  However, once they no longer can afford those medications, they end up turning to heroin, which i'm sure you're all too familiar with.

Crystal methamphetamine is a *HUGE* problem here.  There is a large presence of Mexican drug cartel dealers/suppliers in this area.  They supply more crystal methamphetamine than anything else, but can also supply large amounts of heroin, marijuana, cocaine, etc.


Basically, of all the homeless people I've met, talked to, and helped, an overwhelming majority of them abuse street drugs in some way.  But this isn't a surprise.  Many homeless people also have undiagnosed or untreated mental health issues.  The American mental health system is in utter shambles, and always overwhelmed.  Not to mention our medical insurance system is completely fucked up.  This leads people to be unable to obtain the correct medication at a reasonable price, if at all.  They then use illegal street drugs to self medicate.

	<TEXT>  As far as a prejudice towards the homeless you seem to have just thrown them in because the topic was drug related.

If you ever encounter a homeless person in the US who doesn't have a drug or alcohol addiction, you've found a unicorn.  I live in the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Area of California, and frequently travel through Berkeley, CA.  There are many homeless people in all of these areas from all over the USA.  The reasons they arrive here are as numerous as the people themselves.  However, there is a common theme many of them have stated when I've asked them "What brought you to this city?"  The answer, frequently, is the prevalence and ease of access to drugs, which includes low prices.

Based on my experience having worked in law enforcement and emergency medical systems for almost 20 years, and the fact I have personally been assigned to homeless outreach programs, I know cities with higher availability of drugs almost universally coincides with a higher homeless population.  I know correlation is not causation.  

My question regarding the homeless wasn't just "throwing them in because the topic is drug related."  It's because I'm honestly curious if there is an increase in the homeless population because Colorado is one of the few, if not the first state, to completely legalize marijuana for recreational use.

Even in California, marijuana is legal to possess for recreational use.   However, there are no dispensaries that can legally sell it to anyone without a physician's recommendation for medicinal marijuana.  Meaning the only dispensaries in the state are for medical users only.  There is no way to legally buy marijuana, even though it's recreationally legal.  And there won't be until some time in 2018.

However, it is legal to give less than one ounce (28 grams) to someone.  It's legal to grow it, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Sweeping assumptions and a prejudice towards the homeless, exactly what you want in a deputy sheriff.

Sweeping assumptions huh?  I guess I could have stated that "I imagine all the other bullshit increased" a bit better.  In California, several recent propositions passed which reduced many felony crimes to misdemeanors (mainly drug related crimes), as well as allowing for early release of inmates.  Both of which have led to an increase in crimes of all sorts.  This coincided with the legalization of recreational marijuana... so it's difficult to say which of these things, if any, contributed more than others.


I'm still trying to figure out where you got that I have a prejudice towards the homeless... 

Do some research.

I'm trying.  Talking to people, asking questions of those with first hand experience is generally called "interviewing."  If you don't think that's a valid form of research, you're pretty odd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  the majority of the general public supports it being criminalized and people caught smoking weed being heavily penalized, especially the police (which evidently from this post is still the case).

I don't think it should be heavily penalized.  I think there needs to be more information put out to the public regarding the psychotropic effects of it.  The way the "legalize marijuana" movements have been going is somewhat similar to the tobacco issues in the first half of the 1900s.  It wasn't until years later people began suing the tobacco companies for misleading the public related to the dangers.

Then again, the same is true for all advertisements of prescription medication.  I would imagine at some point in the next 20-40 years, our kids and grandkids will think we were horrible ignorant to allow such widespread marketing/advertisement of dangerous prescription medications. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  My point was marijuana is in no way addictive.

Your point was horribly incorrect.  At least on a broad sense.  It may not be addictive for you.  But that doesn't mean it's not addictive.  Many people are able to consume alcohol without being alcoholics.  Some people cannot drink a single drink without consuming a whole six or 12 pack.  Many of these people cannot go into a bar without falling apart and drinking.... For them, alcohol is incredibly addictive.

Other people can go into a bar, order one beer, drink part of it, and walk away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Try to look up the classes of medications next time you list off all the neurologically active medications you can think of off the top of your head. 

I'm well aware that benzos are a class of medication, and pretty much everything else listed is a specific medication name.  It was a bit redundant.  You're right.

As a sidenote, people legally use alcohol recreationally - purely recreationally really. Is it any surprise they use benzos recreationally too? At least a massive benzo overdose will max out GABA receptors before lethality occurs, massive ethanol overdose will kill you.

Which is one of the leading reasons people have attempted to prohibit alcohol, with little success.. Once something is legal, it's virtually impossible to outlaw it.

Alcohol causes more death and damage than most drugs.  More specifically, it's a more widespread problem as opposed to an acute one.  A major factor in that is the fact it's socially acceptable and legal. </TEXT>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction

From that link:

"Reviews of both clinical research in humans and preclinical studies involving FosB have identified compulsive sexual activity  specifically, any form of sexual intercourse  as an addiction."

So why wouldn't "any form of sexual intercourse" include masturbation or pornography, after all, the end result is the same (i.e. orgasm and dopamine release). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Pornography addiction is not a physical addiction.

Read the title of the link you posted.  It specifically says "Physical dependence."  Again, this is very different than "addiction."

First of all, just because a substance is in your body doesn't mean is crosses the blood-brain barrier.  Second, just because a substance is in your body, doesn't mean you're physically addicted to it.

If you're "physically addicted" to something, you're actually dependent on it.  Thus, I attempted to draw a distinction between addiction and dependence.

When people say they're "addicted" to something, typically they're addicted to their body's response to it.  Our brains naturally have a pleasure/reward system in place in which dopamine is released after some event.  Imagine when you were a kid, and you knew your birthday was coming up.  On your birthday, you opened a present, and it was exactly what you wanted.  Your brain releases dopamine, which makes you feel happy.

Another example, imagine you're a high school baseball player.  You have to work hard to make yourself physically ready to perform/play the game.  You hit a home run, and the crowd cheers.  Your brain releases dopamine, and you feel happy or elated.

Drugs and chemicals (caffeine, sugar, cocaine, etc) have the ability to make our brains release dopamine without having to put in a lot of effort.  This is what makes chemicals (or sometimes actions such as sex, food, gambling, video games) so easy to binge on.  Our brain's pleasure-reward system becomes hijacked, or short circuited, and we realize we've found a shortcut that allows us to enjoy the "high" (release of dopamine) without having to do the hard work that used to be required. 

This is where the addiction comes it.  We start to binge, or over indulge (i.e. compulsory behavior) on things such as alcohol, video games, pornography, methamphetamine, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  While I appreciate your knowledge on the issue, as someone that smoked marijuana for years before becoming The Man, I disagree that marijuana is any more addictive than coffee or tea. 

I never said marijuana was any more (or less) addictive than anything else, let alone coffee or tea.  I just said it was addictive.

And to correct your later assertion that marijuana use mimics brain damage; 

That wasn't my assertion, just something quoted from an article I linked to.  It was also stated that it was temporary, which can be said for any Central Nervous System (CNS) depressant.

I have known many highly intelligent, open minded, and self aware people that have used or currently use marijuana.

Many highly intelligent people also consume alcohol.  When they're drunk, do you think they're as highly intelligent as when they're sober?  The same would be true for marijuana.

The thing is, every person is affected differently by any given substance (i.e. caffeine, nicotine, sugar, alcohol, marijuana, crack, whatever).  There are no two people who have exactly the same effects, or even to the same degree as anyone else.

To be clear, I never said/stated/implied anyone who smokes marijuana will have permanent, lasting effects from it.  However, there are studies showing smoking marijuana before a certain age can be a contributing factor to psychosis later in life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is isn't addictive. At least not physically.

You clearly missed the portion of my post that described the difference between addiction and dependence.

There's a reason we have a type of person called an adrenaline junkie.  They're addicted to the highs produced by high risk activities (i.e. sky diving, extreme sports, etc).  If you think weed isn't addictive just because you don't have physical withdrawal symptoms, you're wrong.

The world has pornography addicts, sex addicts, gambling addicts, etc.  These are just a few examples of physical addictions that don't have withdrawal symptoms.  There's a difference, subtle, but it's there.  Weed is addictive... Just like caffeine, nicotine, sugar, alcohol, etc. </TEXT>
