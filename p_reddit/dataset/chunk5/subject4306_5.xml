	<TEXT> I've had two pelvic exams done by ER doctors and both of them had female nurses in the room, however I don't know if that applies to gynecologists because a large chunk of their job involves pelvic exams. I plan on finding a female gyno to do the insertion, though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been on oral contraceptives for a long time without any adverse emotional affects, so I'm hoping that my body will be used to the hormones at least a little. I will make sure to be very careful and speak out immediately if I feel suicidal in any way. Thank you so much! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Luckily I already have the IUD in my possession, the gyno from hell prescribed it yesterday! I have kickass insurance, too, so it cost me nothing (would've been $400 without insurance!!!). I'm going to see if I can get the IUD inserted at a women's health clinic though, I'm pretty sure there's one here. Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh shit, really?! I'm sorry to hear that. I'm currently on oral contraceptives, so hopefully my body will be used to the hormones. I'll make sure to get help if I start feeling depressed again, though. Thank you so much for telling me this! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahaha yes! The title is exaggerated, I'm a very hyperbolic speaker and never in a thousand years would I have expected my post to get this much attention. Oh, well though. Thank you for the kind words, I hope you have a great weekend. </TEXT>
