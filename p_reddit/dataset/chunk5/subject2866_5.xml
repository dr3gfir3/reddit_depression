	<TEXT> 3 to your continued self care.

No lie, in the beginning, I found therapy useless. My biggest piece of advice to people starting therapy is to tell them, it's ok to not like your therapist. we had court mandated family therapy, where the therapist let each of us talk. Including my stepfather, my abuser. So I had to listen to him for the entire session talk about how crazy I was, how I lied about everything, and the therapist wouldn't let me say anything to interrupt him. I felt terrible about myself and would come back from every session totally disassociated from myself.

My current therapist is great, and I've been seeing her for the past six years. The first time in therapy, I recounted a time where I was assaulted, gave a police report, and the police officers didn't believe me. She actually stopped my narrative and told me, she was sorry how I was treated, and she believed me. It made me cry, just having that affirmation said outloud. When you have that trust with a therapist, I found I felt much more open about exploring my past abuse, and it helped me distance myself from past me. Does that make sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone's definition of needy is different. For me, I am **extremely** needy with my husband about texting/phone calls. When I text him, if he doesn't respond within a half hour I can go ballistic. This only applies when he's not at work (we have a code word for when he's at work and I need him to respond to me ASAP). We worked out the code word resolution when I went totally off on him one day for not answering me, because he was walking the dog. 

A huge trigger for me is the feeling of being ignored, which is what an unanswered text/phone call feels like to me. So once we got to that root issue, it was easier to find a solution which worked for both of us. I try not to abuse the codeword too much, and he is trying to do better at responding to me. </TEXT>
