And yes, only Indians have some weird propensity to wash wooden fittings with water hoses. I've rented out to Indonesians, a Japanese, a French, an Australian and Mainland Chinese, and none of them have done the same thing, while the 4 Indian families I've rented to did. You think the safety deposit is enough to cover the damages? You'll be lucky if they actually complete their contract before their employers terminate their contracts and ship them back to India. </TEXT>

I wouldn't rent to a Chinese who burns incense the whole day since the smell will be stuck in the home for a very long time. My family rents out to Indians (we still do), but every time the kitchen and washroom wooden fittings are destroyed because those tenants don't have the common sense to not use a hose to clean wooden furniture. </TEXT>

I believe Brexit and Trump to be more of an issue to do with immigration. Like in Singapore, no one likes those 'bloody foreigners'. And Hong Kong is just messed up through and through.

And I'm sure the tendering process would have been vigorous, and that CSR SiFang must have satisfied the minimum requirements to have won the contract. It's not like the government wanted to trains to be defective. The trains would have been delivered free of cracks too. In any case, aren't they being repaired now, under warranty. Other than Khaw being silly and saying Harakiri once in a while, what's really the big deal?

And do you really trust the HK media with their extreme pro-democracy and anti-China rhetoric? They'll pounce on anything negative that can be linked to Leung Chun-Ying or the CCP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think there's a fair amount of social mobility and meritocracy here. My parents started out earning a combined income of less than $2500 15 years ago and despite only having an O-Level cert, their combined income now is more than 10 times of what they brought home back then. 

I've heard of multiple stories from my mates during NS of people going through ITE and ending up in University. It's definitely possible to move up the social echelon with dedication and hard work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The E-class is around $270,000 when it was $240,000 a few years back. I think it'll just increase again when the newer generation arrives. Using your example, with a combined income of $14,000 (assuming after-taxes), monthly payment for an E-Class at 2.68% for 6 years 70% loan is $2800+. That's exactly 20%. So I'm guessing people who buy the E-class is earning around that ballpark? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol, what a stupid idea it is to buy a car when you're earning only $2,000+ a month. As a rule, I don't think monthly car payments should exceed 20, maybe 30% if you're pushing it, of one's monthly income. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that it is a religion of violence. Here's just some verses from the Quran:


[We] shall let them live awhile, and then shall drag them to the scourge of the Fire. Evil shall be their fate (2:126)
Slay them wherever you find them. Drive them out of the places from which they drove you. ...Fight against them until idolatry is no more and Gods religion reigns supreme. But if they desist, fight none except the evil-doers(2:19093)
Fighting is obligatory for you, much as you dislike it. But you may hate a thing although it is good for you, and love a thing although it is bad for you. God knows, but you know not (2:216)
" whoever of you recants and dies an unbeliever, his works shall come to nothing in this world and in the world to come. Such men shall be the tenants of Hell, wherein they shall abide forever.  (2:21718)
Those that deny Gods revelations shall be sternly punished; God is mighty and capable of revenge (3:5)
We will put terror into the hearts of the unbelievers. . . . The Fire shall be their home (3:14951)
Those that deny Our revelation We will burn in fire. No sooner will their skins be consumed than We shall give them other skins, so that they may truly taste the scourge. God is mighty and wise (4:5556).
[T]hose that deny Our revelations shall be punished for their misdeeds (6:49) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the detailed explanation. However, I stand by my opinion and would have to disagree with the law. I feel that considering the concept of mercy, leniency and the punishment being too 'tough' is being too kind to a criminal. If a 10 year sentence becomes effectively life imprisonment for the cancer patient, that's too bad. Not that I care. </TEXT>
