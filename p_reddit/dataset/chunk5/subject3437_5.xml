	<TEXT> It depends on the use and construction. If the purpose of the sauce is to add moisture to a dry steak, or flavor one that is very bland, then you are correct - you are masking a mistake.

On the other hand, there's valid use cases - sometimes, I just want a strong sauce to pair with a not strongly seasoned steak. Other times, a sauce built from the drippings of the steak, with a little butter for body and maybe even flour to make it a gravy, can be incredible and is part of the recipe on fancier things - consider [steak au Poivre](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/steak-au-poivre-recipe.html). </TEXT>
