	<TEXT> So there are three routes that you could take: Medical, Research, and Industry, and Academia. Some of these options may require further eduction/certification but that depends on what you want to do.

Medical: Doesn't necessarily mean being a doctor or a nurse. There is a need for people in an administrative or technician position. Further certification may be needed, but there should be something in the public health sector that might work for you.

Research: Doesn't necessarily mean graduate school. Research labs whether its for universities or private institutions some positions may require a lab technician that maintains equipment or assists with a specific procedure in lab. There is also the position of a lab manager that oversees the lab inventory and keeps track of logistics to keep researchers focused on their work.

Industry: If you are incredibly knowledgeable about a procedure or a technique or the materials necessary to perform a technique you might be able to get a job to generate oligos, prepare antibodies, or be a sales representative for selling biotechnology.

Academia: Not necessarily teaching, but at some universities they require someone to supervise and maintain the instructional labs. This one may require much more certification though.

It depends mainly on what you see yourself doing.

Everyone knows the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. But what changes does it undergo to promote cancer and other diseases? We sit down with Dr. Nathan Lanning of California State University, Los Angeles and discuss his work regarding mitochondria dysfunction.

RadioBio is a podcast where UC Merced biology graduate students talk with scientists about biological systems, from molecules to ecosystems.

	<TEXT> Yeah its a pretty great paper outlining the field. I also highly recommend any paper/review that uses the hallmark perspective of cancer. My second favorite is on the emerging hallmark of metabolism in cancer: http://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdf/S1550-4131(15)00621-X.pdf  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take pride in my own publications. After all the time and hard work there is nothing more satisfying than seeing it in publication for the first time!

On another note I love the Hallmarks of Cancer by Hanahan. This reivew is an absolute must read if you are interested in entering the world of cancer biology.

	<TEXT> Usually the first semester is usually the roughest, but practice time management and do the work your supposed to do on time you'll be fine. Once you get the hang of being a teaching assistant and have your project worked out you'll be in the swing of things. My advice is try to get the course requirements out of the way (but dont overload yourself) cause then that makes more time for research. If you are nervous I'd look into working with your PI over the summer if possible to get a feel on things before the school year starts. Lastly an absolute must do is developing a strong social network with your peers and planning some fun things in your downtime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want to get your degree at a UC (one of the best university groups around i might add) and have affordable off-campus housing UC Merced is the place to be. As a Biology major classwork will keep you pretty busy (especially with extracurriculars), but for free time it depends on how social you are. You could attend a party every week if you are connected, you can go to Yosemite national park, or honestly a day trip to anywhere else in the bay area.  </TEXT>
