	<TEXT> I agree. However, allowing yourself to get roped into such a situation against your better judgment in the hopes of actually having a chance to sleep with your spouse again... Not such a good thing.

The more I talk about this, the more details I recall. It started as an attempted four-way to help a couple of shy friends get with each other. I hadn't gotten any since two months before my daughter was born, some eight months prior. I saw an opportunity, and took it.

Wife ended up with other guy, I ended up with other girl. Neither of us were bothered that it had gone that way, until I realized that I'd basically been shunted aside so she could screw someone else. I realized that the relationship I thought I had was a lie, and called it off. </TEXT>

We applaud Neil Armstrong for being the first man on the moon, but I'd bet you anything that he regrets that long pause as he spoke the first words there. "One...giant leap for mankind"

So, go ahead and doubt. But also know that your doubts will always be the truth, unless you try. </TEXT>

The wire cutters one was because of cattle rustlers; if you were caught with wire cutters and couldn't prove it was for your job, the only logical conclusion back then was that you were a cattle rustler.

In the first draft, I had the mechanic offer up a junker vehicle, which promptly fell apart when our lead touches it. I thought it was amusing at the time, but it just felt wrong when I hit that point in the rewrite. So now it's gone; instead, the hero goes introspective while the mechanic works out a deal with a third party. 

...reading that back, I realize I've got to learn to summarize better. It reads better than this sounds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **FOUND GLITCH/EXPLOIT:**

Scrolling rapidly up and down drastically increases production. I've experimented with this and found that it actually increases by about 300%

Creating at 1.0 (Approx)quintillion/second over 10 seconds. Get approx. 10 quintililon. Checks out.

Rapid scrolling averaged (over five attempts) approx. 30 quintillion produced in 10 seconds.

FYI, OP. </TEXT>
