	<TEXT> Not sure how Xbox works but if you buy any dlc and proceed to buy season pass, I don't think you get anything back. Which is why it's always worth buying season pass. I always do. Just like the psn store and in-game store says, if you purchase season, don't buy individual dlc as you will be billed additionally. Every single cod game, I always buy the digital deluxe edition.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your style depends on the mode u play. I'm a super rusher. I play only hc kc. So that suits me good. Sometimes my friends invite me to hc snd....i rush every game and first to die. Eventually i started NOT rushing in  s n d and been winning matches. Dom isnt a rushing either. When i use to rush in dom, i would make the spawns flip every time. Just cap home flag and dont rush pass B flag. U keep them trapped at their spawn. But im a rusher, i hate camping and waiting. I have no patience. So i play hc kc 90% of time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no game statistics. I believe you're referring to the cry babies who don't have the skills to use them. You think the guy who killed them said " omg, i just killed that guy so easy, this thing needs a nerf "  , no. It's the ones who die by a specialist and of course the latency in a public match.  Sometimes I run out of a room and look left instead of right and that's my mistake. People have unlucky deaths and blame the specialist weapons. Then they look for something to blame. I've heard many people complain about the marshall, I've died from the marshall 16 about 5-6 times and I play everyday online. I was lucky enough to get the marshall 16 the same day it dropped and people kill me all the time whilst I used it as a primary. That just goes to show MAYBE I didn't have the skills enough to wield it for it to be OP in my enemies eyes. I don't care enough to whine about any specialist weapons that killed me though because I think it's silly and I think the ones who do just have way to much time on their hands.  </TEXT>
