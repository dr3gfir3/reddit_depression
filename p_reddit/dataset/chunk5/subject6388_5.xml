	<TEXT> No. We were 16 and I was "hungover" due to no sleep and felt weird when I woke up. I was an idiot but I felt it'd be a bad idea to have sex because I was previously thinking with my dick and now that I had slept for a while, having sex felt quite risky. So, I told her we can't do it and then she got SUPER PISSED and said why I asked if I wasn't serious. I told her that I was quite "hungover" and horny  without sleep and she just told me to never contact her again. She felt embarrassed maybe.  
I felt bad and apologized. Blocked her on FB I think. After maybe one or two years I added her again and we text sometimes but doesn't feel like we're friends. Just occasional texts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would kick out shitty friends out of my life. All they have done is make me feel bad about myself and never really helped me in any way.  
I would focus on studies more as it has turned out true that people come and go. Most of the friendships end at some point so I think being "selfish" like doing productive things to make you a better person would be better than spending time with friends. </TEXT>
