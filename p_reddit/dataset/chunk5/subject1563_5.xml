	<TEXT> With the extraordinary advances in technology I don't know if film will exist in 100 years but -

 Now only people with a passion for live theatre bother to pay for the experience.

What a weird thing to say. I am certainly not passionate about the theatre but I like to go. People should go more to the theatre.

	<TEXT>  You guys trashing on Sinister are never gonna make it in this business with that kind of attitude.

Could you explain this to me? What exactly is wrong with some people on a screenwriting sub voicing an opinion? 

So you are not allowed to be critical on here? Because I know a lot of users who are, including the one below who agrees with you.

 You need to get a handle on your personal insecurities and realize everyone is out there trying to do their best work.

Presumed insecurities - ad hominem and unnecessary. 

Trying to do their best work is enough, once you are successful? That is what I am getting from here. Because that script wasn't some masterpiece. Where is the defence coming from? If a user posted it anon many of you would be trashing it.

And the users on here know that this is right. Many of the same people who are upvoted this comment would be trashing it. You undoubtedly would make a sarcastic comment about none of us knowing how the industry works, and that we are all outsiders and that.

Because none of us can actually read scripts at all. We're just that dumb. And we can't make up our minds at all. Cause we are just that stupid. 

What are the point of these posts where you just dismiss others because you have found yourself in a position of work? 

And yes, I think many of us would love to see your work, since you seem so determined to undermine the rest of us and our stupid opinions.

	<TEXT> **Incaprettamento**

This is a rare form of homicidal ligature strangulation used by the Italian Mafia. One end of the rope is tied like a noose around the victims neck the other end secures the victims ankles, so that they are connected to each other. 

Victims can avoid constriction around their neck or asphyxiation if they keep their legs in a flexed position. However, when they tire they can no longer maintain the legs in the flexed position, the legs relax and the airway becomes constricted. This was meant to torment their victims and act as a warning to others. 

A case series of 18 cases of incaprettamento were reviewed to determine whether the binding of the body happened before or after death, interestingly, they found that death by strangulation occurred before incaprettamento (the victim was strangled and the body was bound post mortem).

Typical homicide ritual of the Italian Mafia (incaprettamento)

	<TEXT>  Read spent only 13 months outside prison between the ages of 20 and 38, having been convicted of crimes including armed robbery, firearm offences, assault, arson, impersonating a police officer and kidnapping

 . Around this time, Read had a fellow inmate cut both of his (Read's) ears off in order to be able to leave H division temporarily

 Read was ambushed and stabbed by members of his own gang in a sneak attack when they felt that his plan to cripple every other inmate in the entire division and win the gang war in one fell swoop was going too far. Another theory is that James "Jimmy" Loughnan, a longtime friend of Read, with Patrick "Blue" Barnes, wished to benefit from a contract put on Read's head by the Painters' and Dockers' Union. Read lost several feet of intestine in the attack.

  At the time Read was serving a 16 and a half-year sentence after attacking a judge in an effort to get Loughnan released from prison.[5]

Taking that on board and knowing the true rate of unemployment in America it is far more shocking than you think.

If you actually examined the data you will see a different story.

	<TEXT> If I was to be honest here:

* I want to get published.

* I want to sell.

If I didn't sell, I would not get published more than once, maybe twice in the current atmosphere? 

(From what I read the long term support of those authors who were of genuine literary talent but took a while to build the readership is gone. 

Read a few interviews with some of these (Irving, DeLillo, think Franzen mentioned a few recently) who have openly said they do not think their first novel would be published today or that they would have been able to continue without certain supports from publishers - a terrible loss for literature in my opinion.)

* Writing to write.

I don't think that is me. I write literary fiction. It is somewhat experimental. It is time consuming. I am still I think a few years (2 at most come on Schindy) from having something that will work. Think B.S. Johnson. Well, maybe that is not a good thing considering how it ended for him.

I have other interests in the visual arts but they are just as financially unsound, yet I enjoy painting far more than writing. I just think I am a better writer than a painter, or need to get certain ideas out which come across better through prose.

I don't know what that really makes me. A child or two worlds, or maybe three, but in the end still only a child. </TEXT>

Modern writers living, Banville, Amis at his peak, DeLillo is criminally underrated as a stylist, Will Self definitely there.

Everytime I pick up a Julian Barnes or an Ian McEwan or a Jhumpa Lahiri and read of the 'spellbinding beauty' or 'stunning poetry' of their prose I think what am I doing. I should write a novel. </TEXT>
