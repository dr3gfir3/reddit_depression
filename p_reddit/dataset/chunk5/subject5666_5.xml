	<TEXT> Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky on Tuesday suggested he's not sold on the need for investigations into the mounting controversies roiling President Donald Trump's administration.
Paul said in a radio interview on the "Kilmeade and Friends" radio program Tuesday that he didn't think it was prudent to launch "investigation after investigation" on fellow members of the Republican Party.
"I don't think it's useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party," he said.
He continued: "We'll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing Obamacare if we're spending our whole time having Republicans. I think it makes no sense."
Several Republicans in Congress have called for a full inquiry into Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Trump. Statements Flynn made about conversations he had with a Russian ambassador before Trump's inauguration ultimately led to his resignation on Monday


How many members of Congress? 535

You don't think they could have more than a couple projects going on at once? Maybe hire a bipartisan investigator? If this shit with trump is true the American people have the right to know  </TEXT>
