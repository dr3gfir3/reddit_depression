	<TEXT> Sony customer support is one of the worst. 

Back in 2010 - 2011 I ended up buying a Xbox 360 slim just because Sony customer service pissed me off. 

I had downloaded a movie off the PSN network. It ended up being corrupted. It wouldn't let me re-download it again. So I re-rented the movie, and re-downloaded. I was with a girl I was seeing at 11pm at night on a Saturday. 

On the Monday I phoned customer service to get a refund for the first corrupted download. They told me they will do it, but because I didn't phone them right away it will be a one time thing and be goodwill on the company. Goodwill? I really wanted to flip my shit but let it go. 

I had other various issues with Sony Products and Sony customer service sucked in every instance. In fact for a lot of their products they outsource their support to 3rd party companies. 

The companies with the best customer service in my opinion are Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. Sony need to learn from these companies. 

If Sony didn't make the PS4 so amazingly well this console cycle I would have avoided them entirely based on their shitty customer service.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if you're a Teksavvy customer or not, it sounds like you're not.

FACT: I was told by more than one customer service agent. Data caps are not in place in BC as they do not have access to track our Data usage.

When I log into my Teksavvy account to see Usage, it even says:

"Sorry, we are not able to display usage information for the services associated with your customer account. Please call support at 1.877.779.1575 for assistance"

So I called in, and they said the same thing every other customer service agent said. They can't track MY USAGE because Shaw doesn't give them this information, therefore my Data caps are not enforceable.

Unless you're a Teksavvy customer and have actually phoned in and inquired with an active account, don't copy and paste shit from Wikipedia. Secondly, when I had connectivity issues with my internet, the customer service agent said he COULD NOT assess my issue as they do not have access to these logistics.

Now when I phoned in for my TV cable, which is still with shaw, they could easily decipher my issue, they could reset my cable box, etc.

Teksavvy couldn't even reset my router for fuck sakes. So if they are considered as "last mile" infrastructure in BC, then they have absolutely minimal access. </TEXT>

We have a similar system to yours, except our Legislative and Executive systems are fused.

It's called the "Responsible Government" model.

In fact, our system would be extremely beneficial to you Americans right now as it would allow your government to function without obstructionism from the salty Republicans.

While the separation of powers emphasizes checks and balances, it's really being exploited to halt any positive change for you guys. Obama had to manipulate through a universal system because the Republicans refused any such system. Had they been more open to helping the people, they could have facilitated a bi-partisan bill that wouldn't have had as many issues and holes as Obamacare. </TEXT>

1st Image:

Downloading Additional Content: 0%

Second Image:

Then after 3-4 minutes it shows a cancel button underneath the download bar, which I click that, and it takes me to the regular lobby window:


I'm confused right now as to whether I'm the only one experiencing this issue.

To try to fix it, I deleted war thunder from my PS4. I deleted the Settings save file from both the PS4 and the PSN cloud save. I then turned my PS4 off.

I turned my PS4 on, and downloaded a fresh copy of War thunder, which took 30 minutes. I then restarted my PS4, and when it booted back up, launched War thunder. Same issue arises. I normally wouldn't care, but needing to wait 3-4 mins for the cancel button to pop up is annoying.

Anyone else facing this issue? </TEXT>

Harper mangled our GDP and economy as a whole.

And yes, Chretien and Harper faced recessions near the end of their terms, so you can't say it was all roses for Chretien's tenure.

	<TEXT> Comparing Chrtien and Justin Trudeau is laughable. 

Chrtien was one of our greatest career politicians who left his final political position as the Canadian Prime Minister with Canada in a significantly better position. 

Trudeau is still in the process of early "testing". 

Not to mention Chrtien put together a star cabinet of career politicians. Where Trudeau has put together a cabinet of more politicians in the early "testing" phase. 

Politicians need to make and break promises. The other guys competing for the Prime Minister are doing it too. What matters is which promises you break. 

If you want to blast Chrtien for one thing, you can blame him for being in Clintons back pocket for NAFTA.

Also, while Prime Ministers of Canada (and myself) would love to legalize marijuana, you have the issue of international treatises that put our economic and social ties to our biggest trade partners at risk.  </TEXT>

When I tell Siri to Call [Contact in IOS List] on Skype, it won't do it. It only calls people on my Skype Contact List. Is this intended? I was hoping I could call anyone in my IOS contact list without adding them all to my Skype Contact list.

2)

Some of my contact list, when I push the Call button (Just under the picture and name, it has 4 buttons (Message, Call, Video, and Other), it brings up a drop down menu that lists regular calls and then Skype calls.

But with other contacts it just straight out calls them regularly. None of these contacts are added to my Skype contact lists.


Thanks in advance to anyone who clears this up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the manufacturer follows all laws in manufacturing the guns, then how can they be held liable if their product is used for malicious acts?

Most people use these guns for sport and hunting, not mass murder.

Therefore the manufacturer of the guns have a market defined by sport and hunting uses.

Now if every person who bought a gun went out and created mayhem and death, then sure, the gun manufacturers could be held accountable for providing the tools for these acts.

It's just a stupid lawsuit taking away resources and attention from the real problem of mass shooters. Lack of funding for mental healthcare, and closing the loopholes for screening on gun purchasers. </TEXT>

The only thing close to that is if you die on the operating table. 

But that only protects the doctor from unforeseen complications. If you can prove the doctor was negligent though, that protection goes out the window. If you can prove the doctor was grossly negligent or malicious he can even be on the hook for felony charges. 

You simply can't waive your right to life because it's a slippery slope. It could also be exploited.

I think they just need to offer more funding for these guys who recognize they have a problem with pedophilia and maybe they can get them some discreet help, before the problem ends up causing them to spiral down a hole they can never recover from, which ultimately would endanger young children as they spiral down that hole.

Though, when an adult starts soliciting sex with underage children (especially 12-14 year olds), they should be prosecuted with the full extent of the law, regardless if they "fell through the cracks". </TEXT>

I don't play pokemon go much these days (especially during the day) because I can't leave the app open for very long to track my progress as I need the juice on my battery. Now if they allowed push notifications and location services, then yeah, it would be more practical.

Being the POTUS is kind of a big deal, and your decisions have ramifications for the country.

If she can barely stand on her two feet, and has CLEAR AND OBVIOUS health issues, why doesn't she MAN UP and admit she is in no position health wise to run for election? These health issues also just add to her legal issues, and on top of that, we know she's in the banksters back pocket. Something the country is getting sick of, having banks through lobbyists run the country. Something Trump is vehemently against.

Why doesn't she let someone like Bernie Sanders take the Democratic seat, so we know that the POTUS for the next 4 years isn't going to let the banks run amuck, whether the POTUS is Trump or Sanders.

If she doesn't step aside, she clearly doesn't care about the citizens nor the country itself. </TEXT>
