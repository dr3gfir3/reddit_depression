	<TEXT> Whoa, this is exactly what I would have said too. Number 1 came during middle school, when I realized that I wanted to be popular but didn't know how. The rest of the points followed naturally. I'm now very extroverted and apparently a "natural leader"--but I know I wasn't born that way. </TEXT>

How is this burglary? (This is a serious question) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look man, I love Griffiths and all, but his lectures were way too abstract for me, and dealt too much with rigorously monitoring consistent histories. I wish I could say that I learned a lot but I didn't. This semester I've been better, mostly cause I just read the book super carefully. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're welcome!

As useful as these are, however, my limiting factor is often time and not a lack of resources. I hope you find them relevant and actually useful :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Introduction to Cosmology, by Barbara Ryden is fairly engaging and not too mathematical. Plus it's free [online](http://www.if.ufrgs.br/oei/santiago/fis02012/Introduction-Cosmology-Ryden.pdf). It could be a bit much for a 100 level class though... </TEXT>
