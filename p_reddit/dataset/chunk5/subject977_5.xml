Edit: [Here](http://imgur.com/F3RKlYX) is the test. It is in German so I'll translate the important part. 
* Note Landesweit = Grade Countrywide
* Note Weltweit = Grade Worldwide

So you see 9% of Germany, 17% of the whole world. Which I imagine is a big part of the African countries that have internet and India(?) </TEXT>

To the lab meat. I can see your point, but what do you think about that meat in labs having a positive effect on the environment since we won't have to cut down forests for big farms.  </TEXT>
