	<TEXT> I used this recipe: http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2014/12/16/funfetti-cookies-supreme/ (I'm mobile and I don't know how to make the link pretty).

That recipe includes frosting if you like your cookies frosted!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funfetti is the best. I feel like it's what happiness would look like if feelings were food. 

I actually don't like frosting on cookies or brownies! I know, I'm insane.  </TEXT>

Only thing I did differently was made the cookies smaller so I was able to get 2 dozen+ out of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really is! Google Pioneer Woman bacon appetizers to find the recipe with bake times. The best part is they are great at room temp which works well for an office potluck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pigs in a blanket, crockpot sausages in bbq sauce, pizza dip, pizza pinwheels, etc.

But my ultimate suggestion is you take Club crackers, put a tsp of brown sugar on each one, and then wrap with a half slice of bacon. Bake them on low heat for an hour and they are like crack! You can put parmesan cheese instead of the sugar, but the sugar ones always disappear first when I make these. </TEXT>
