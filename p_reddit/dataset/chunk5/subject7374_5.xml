	<TITLE> Just lost my ship and thousands of resources...and I couldn't be happier. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-17 03:46:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last night, I went crashed-ship hunting on a barren Korvax planet to find a new ship that looked better than my current Gek ship but with the same health (8).

I find a few, hop in each of them to find out the health, then I hop out and do what I need to do (transfer resources or fly to the next ship).

Soon, I find a Korvax ship with the same health, so I get in to see the health, hop out again, the game saves...and the game crashes. I reload the game (PS4, btw) and find that my Gek ship with all 40 of my full resource stacks has disappeared.

So, now I'm currently stuck on a dead planet with a crappy-looking ship that has broken Launch Thrusters and Pulse Engine and I'm excited beyond words.

THIS is the experience I was waiting for; stranded on a barren planet with a broken ship, minimal resources, no sign of life for miles, extreme weather (must be glitched, because it's hot and cold at the same time), minimal protection and a nothing but the infinite cosmos above me. The challenge excites me. This is what the legendary stories are made of.

Ladies, gentlemen, Korvax, Gek and Vy'keen alike, I shall see you at the center.

Or maybe not. </TEXT>

Without a beacon or anchor, the time machine would simply stay in place and, due to the cosmological shift of the Earth and Solar System through the universe, anything sent back in time would arrive in cold, empty space.

For those interested, the page states "As an example, a Mister Handy torso and thruster assembly including a Tesla field and three buzzsaw-equipped appendages, combined with sentry bot arms wielding Gatling lasers and decked out in voltaic armor plating, results in an automatron that can single-handedly massacre entire hostile strongholds at range without needing ammunition, will devastate almost anything foolish enough to enter melee range, can move at impressive speed, can carry more than most organic companions, and is small enough to accompany its master everywhere." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's headcanon. Yeah, the facts can tear apart even the most finely-crafted headcanon to shreds. I know that the filming and interviews make it impossible. But the important thing to note is that I'm not pushing this as fact. At best, I'm trying to explain the chills I feel as best as I can when I watch this scene.

I appreciate the input with the facts, but I say "wishful thinking" in the first sentence. I know it'll never be the way I've outlined it here, but a man can dream, can't he?

Who knows? If multiverse theory is indeed correct, that means there's got to be a few universes out there where this actually happened. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Headcanon] Day Of The Doctor - Curator Scene </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-05 04:18:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know its only wishful thinking, but thats why its headcanon, right? Anyway, heres my headcanon about the curator scene at the end of Day Of The Doctor.


Its the first take of filming the curator scene.


While Matt is talking to himself, saying I could retire and be the curator of this place., hes waiting for the next line off-screen said by someone else. Hes expecting someone who looks suspiciously like the Doctor. As Paul McGann was attached to do Night Of The Doctor, the writers probably brought him in to do the table reads for that scene and telling Matt that hell have prosthetics or something to make him appear older on screen, and that Matt will have to look shocked when he hears his voice. So, Matts waiting for Paul to speak.


But he doesnt.


You know, I really think you might.


Matt freezes up. His expression goes from smiling to absolute, genuine shock. He knows that voice. Any Doctor Who fan worth their salt knows that voice. He turns to look at whos speaking and cant believe his eyes. He gets up and walks over to meet them face-to-face. Matt is in genuine awe at the fact that hes acting opposite Tom Baker himself. For a moment, hes a little kid again, visions of blue boxes and long scarves dancing in his dreams.


Then the real world hits him. Hes an actor, so he has to act. He has to say the words hes rehearsed a hundred times over. But does he say them as the Doctor or as Matt Smith?


I never forget a face.


The scene proceeds as written, Matt barely restraining himself from outright gushing and fangirling over his predecessor. And at the end, after Tom walks off-screen, Matt looks at the camera, crosses his arms and smiles. As the Doctor, this says that he's happy his journey isn't over. But as Matt, he's saying "Take that.", trying to look smug.


And it's because of this headcanon that I'll never not have chills when I watch that scene again and again. </TEXT>
