	<TEXT> Did the Board decide not to get rid of the exhibit stored in sector E because they felt they were protecting people/sea life by not releasing it? And, if so, would that suggest it's something that has never before been officially "discovered," i.e. some form of ocean life that is highly dangerous, violent, and not a commonly found or known animal? Also, if all of this happens to be the case, why would they have ever put it on display, as has been suggested so far ("Exhibit E contains old exhibits the Board decided not to get rid of").? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel as if a group of my friends aren't actually my friends. We live in the same dorm and it feels like they just used me for my room and some of my stuff and that, once I outlived their purpose, they disregarded me. It's been about a month since they've asked me to hang out with them, yet they hang out together as a group. Anytime I ask to hang out, they usually will individually say they are busy, but I often know they're hanging out because, like I said, we live in the same dorm. None of them seem to even acknowledge my existence any more, unless we happen to bump into each other. It's a terrible feeling, one I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  </TEXT>
