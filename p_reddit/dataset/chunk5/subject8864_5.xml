	<TEXT> Would anyone know where I can find National Palace Museum replicas in Taipei other than in the National Palace museum?  Specifically I am looking to buy a replica of Su Shi's Han Shi Tie  

And also, where could I find good calligraphy and painting to put in my study?  And roughly how much would it cost? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read some interesting threads about the mental/spiritual struggle with boxing.  Sometimes we're forced to stop, but sometimes boxing is the force needed to improve our lives.  I feel like my gym friends don't talk about it that much, but I'm always curious about everyone's stories.  Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We were studying population distribution, and playing around with some variables, and she said "old people can't instantly give birth to old versions of themselves, " and erased the wrong part.  

And then I started imagining the whole scene in my head.  Imagine two old people at the maternity ward:

"Gertrude, oh Jesus she's coming out!" said Robert.

A wrinkly, naked zombie version of Gertrude sprang forth from her lower parts and the wrinkly beast writhed in agony over its unnatural existence.

"WHY?  WHY WOULD SUCH A THING HAPPEN!" said Gertrude. *sob sob*

"It's the math!  Damn you math!  DAMN YOU!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been trying to look at the manosphere for some male friends, but for the most part they've been fleeting, or I can't even find a connection.  I guess it's like online dating, you can't make a connection unless another human being is in front of you. </TEXT>
