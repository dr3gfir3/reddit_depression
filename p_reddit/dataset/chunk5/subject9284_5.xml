Here you go!

WASHINGTON  The spying by the Obama administration on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump reportedly was even worse than what he has alleged.

And it had nothing to do with Russia but everything to do with politics.

Sources in the intelligence community claim the potentially illegal revealing of names, or unmasking, of people in the Trump camp who were under surveillance was done purely for political purposes to hurt and embarrass (candidate) Trump and his team.

The bombshell revelations come from rank and file members of the intelligence community who are fighting back against a stonewall by the leaders at the nations spy agencies, according to Fox News.

Reporter Adam Housley said the sources are not Trump people but are frustrated with the politics that is taking place in these (intelligence) agencies.

And what they have revealed is amazing. Here is what they told Fox:

1) Surveillance targeting the Trump team during the Obama administration began months ago, even before the president had become the GOP nominee in July.

2)The spying on the Trump team had nothing to do with the collection of foreign intelligence or an investigation into Russia election interference.

3) The spying was done purely for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security and everything to do with hurting and embarrassing Trump and his team.

4) The person who did the unmasking was someone very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world, and is not in the FBI.

5) Congressional investigators know the name of at least one person who was unmasking names.

6) The initial surveillance on the Trump team led to a number of names being unmasked.
7) House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has known about the unmasking since January.

8) Two sources in the intelligence community told Nunes who did the unmasking and told him at least one of the names of someone in the Trump team who was unmasked. The sources also gave Nunes the serial numbers of the classified reports that documented the unmasking.

9) It took Nunes a number of weeks to figure out how to see those intelligence reports because the intelligence agencies were stonewalling him, and not allowing the chairman or other people to see them.

10) There were only two places Nunes could have seen the information: where the sources work, which would have blown their cover; and the Eisenhower Executive Office building on the White House grounds, which houses the National Security Council and has computers linked to the secure system containing the reports he sought.

11) Nunes got access to that system on March 21 with the help of two Trump administration officials.

The Wall Street Journals Kimberly Strassel reported that the documents Nunes saw confirming the Obama administration spied on the Trump team for months arent easily obtainable, since they arent the finished intelligence products that Congress gets to see.

She said there were dozens of documents with information about Trump officials.
Strassel also reported there was a stonewall against the Intelligence committee chairman because, for weeks Mr. Nunes has been demanding intelligence agencies turn over said documentswith no luck, so far.

She also learned that, along with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, one other Trump official was unmasked.
(Flynn resigned after his unmasking was leaked to the press as part of reports that he spoke on the phone with the Russian ambassador before the new administration took office. President Trump said the two discussed nothing inappropriate and Flynn was just doing his job, but the president asked for the aides resignation because he was not completely honest in his initial account of the conversation.)

But even the reports that did not unmask identities were written in ways that made clear which Trump officials were being discussed.
And, importantly, the documents were circulated at the highest levels of government.

Strassel concluded, To sum up, Team Obama was spying broadly on the incoming administration.

What do YOU think? Is Obama spying scandal worse than Watergate? Sound off in todays WND poll.

Fox also reports that the Senate Judiciary Committee is looking into whether leaks of information targeting the Trump team could have come from the FBI, because it requested Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, warrants that led to the acquisition of some of the foreign surveillance.

Nunes has said the FBI has not responded to his requests for information, and a source told Fox the agency is refusing to cooperate with the House investigation.

Fox also reported the Senate Judiciary Committee is looking into whether the FBI wrongly included political opposition research from Trumps opponents in its probe.

And whether the FBI paid a former British spy who wrote a sensational and discredited report alleging wild improprieties by Trump and his aides.

On Friday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer noted the day before the president tweeted his accusation that Obama had spied on him, comments were made by a senior administration official, foreign policy expert, Dr. Evelyn Farkas, (which) together with previous reports that have been out, raised serious concerns on whether or not there was an organized and widespread effort by the Obama administration to use and leak highly sensitive intelligence information for political purposes.
As WND reported in depth, Farkas appeared tohave inadvertently confirmed the former presidents administration spied on then President-elect Trumps transition team for political purposes.

Speaking on MSNBC March 2, she confirmed that not only was the previous administration collecting intelligence on the Trump team, it wasattempting to share it as far and wide as possible.

Farkas (Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas) claimed the information was about Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, but just days later, intelligence chiefs who had seen the classified information in question, including Obamas own former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper as well as former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, said they have seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump team and the Russian government.

That would appear to indicate the real reason the Obama administration was feverishly collecting and sharing the classified information was not for national security purposes, but for political reasons.
On Friday, Spicer said, Dr. Farkass admissions alone are devastating.

And that, [I]n the ordinary course of their work, NSC  National Security Council  staff discovered information that may support the questions raised by the President and Dr. Farkass claim. These are serious issues. They raise serious concerns. And if true, the issues would be devastating.

Spicer then lectured reporters for ignoring the Farkas story and growing evidence that Obama did indeed spy on the Trump team, scolding them, [I]f everyone was treating the President and the administration fairly, youd ask a series of much different questions.

	<TEXT> I agree w the Deep State comment, but I think Comey has the best interests of America 1st.

Part of that is not throwing 100% of the prior administration in jail (where legally they all technically belong), because it would look reaaaaaaly bad and if The American People knew everything Obummer and Hitlary did, mass chaos would ensue (just a theory).  So I get the sense he's balancing between quietly collecting evidence against anyone involved to use as leverage later, while trying to protect the integrity of our institutions (Executive, Legislative and Judicial)
