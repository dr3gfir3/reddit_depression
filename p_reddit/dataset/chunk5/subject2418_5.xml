	<TEXT> Actually, getting as much done as he did with the obstruction makes him effective.  
   
Not to mention the root of that obstruction: total racism. That's all it was. Obama never lost his cool because he knew that's what they wanted, just one slip up where they could say: "see." He never did it, despite all the most horrid barely masked racism he dealt with. He is far too savvy to not know that's all it was. And why was it? To drum up support. If the Republicans looked obstructive or bullying to a black guy, it plays to their base. It's one thing to defy another party, but to stick it to a black guy, well, that's just dandy cotton candy to some folks. Even Donald Trump got in the game.  
  
Barack got it done. He did it under racist pressure. He did it while being a great father, while being a funny dude, while being a role model. He did it with thoughtfulness. He did it without one *major* screw up, no affair, no 4 trillion dollar wars. He did one hell of a job considering he was doing the hardest job their is, and I'm glad people are coming around to see how nice of a legacy he's leaving behind. He's wrapping up a pretty decent package to hand off to whoever is next.  </TEXT>

He's f'ing this up in ways that indicate personal hubris and inability to know how the political game works, not deliberate misstepping. He wanted this, but he didn't realize what he signed up for, didn't realize he had to pivot and he totally could have (if he had this would be a totally different show right now). This is not deliberate, though he may even try to spin it like that himself to save face. This is just colossal ineptitude at playing the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No no offense! Kind of. It happened that when I went there was an event called [Journes du Patrimoine](http://next.paris.fr/english/visit/flagship-events/journees-du-patrimoine-heritage-days/rub_8208_stand_34125_port_18969). So I thought "Oh going to the President's house the only two days it's open would be cool." I went on Sunday and stood in line for... about 7 hours. In the rain. With no umbrella. It was just chance that when I got there, I'm walking up with some people I met in line and I said "that's M. Hollande......" and it actually was, meeting the people who were checking out his house.  </TEXT>

Yet.... you can hear so much doubt, and so much twisted confusion in their tone when they say it. Like a little voice inside them, you can hear it speaking to them as they say it. I would not be surprised to see more and more no longer able to put up with this cruel jackass shell of a man. </TEXT>
