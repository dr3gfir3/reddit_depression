	<TEXT> Jake Roberts that fucking genius has the best story of all time.  Rick rude would find a girl before the show and she would be the girl he would kiss, this was part of his gimmick. Well Jake the snake thought it would be funny  to go find that girl and asked her to blow him in the parking lot right before there segment.  After he was done he told her not to swallow, she then went ringside and kissed Rick rude. Jake Roberts is the God of savages  </TEXT>
