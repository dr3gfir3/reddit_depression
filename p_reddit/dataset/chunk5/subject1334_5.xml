	<TEXT> Because when you hear yourself talk normally, your voice resonates in your skull and creates more bass so you hear it differently. When we listen to ourselves in a recording it's not resonating in our skull so it sounds different. The voice you hear on a recording is what your voice actually sounds like to other people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've taken both IR Adderall and XR Adderall and I very much prefer the XR. I hated having to bother with taking more pills throughout the day and I hated the 'feel good for a couple hours then come down' cycle of having to take more than 1 throughout the day. For me, XR was just a lot easier to deal and was smoother since it's just constant throughout the day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you just started, your doctor started you out on a low dosage to find the the lowest possible dosage that works for you with the intention of slowly increasing it until you find the right dosage. 10mg is pretty low, especially for IR Adderall, so I defintely wouldn't give up on it yet. Especially since how the low dosage has affected you, it seems like there's a good potential for it to be a good fit. Just tell your doctor what you just told us. That you can feel it, but that it's not helping enough and you should get a higher dosage. Hope it works out. Best of luck! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I take Adderall daily now and it has been an absolute life saver. But at the very beginning of getting my ADHD under control, I started with Strattera. And I just absolutely could not do it. Simply stated, it made me feel like complete and utter shit. It made me physically ill to the point of vomiting on a handful of occasions and any time I would take it, I felt like I was in the come down of adderall, except all the time. It was a downright terrible experience for me. Has anyone else had similar experiences trying Strattera? What are some of your experiences with it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is exactly the same way I feel, and is completely right. High school would have gone so much better and I would've and could've done a lot better and achieved a lot more had I, and my parents, gotten my ADHD under control before I graduated. And I do seriously regret how I did in High School because I know that I was and am capable of doing better and doing more. But what's done is done. I can't go back and fix it, so there's no point in lingering on it. I just have to be thankful that it's under control now and do my best from here on out. There's not much else you can do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This doesn't really answer your question, but as from experience, I'm a 20 year old with ADHD that I, and my parents, didn't get under control until I was graduated from high school. I was smart enough that I still made it through somehow although I didn't do nearly as well as I could have and I seriously regret it. The advice I would give would be to get it under control as soon as possible before his workload and school get tougher when it actually matters.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At least right now, I don't want to see Hazelbaker or Diaz get sent back down. Especially if they keep playing like they have been. Although I can't imagine any of the other three, especially not Peralta going anywhere except back to MLB. However, I was and still am really excited to see Tejada get a chance to play, especially with how he did in spring training. But anyway, with the limited roster space, what do you think and hope will be the Cardinals course of action when those three return from the DL? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it has as much to do with not wanting to over use anti-virals for minor infections as it does with the fact that anti-virals don't work on a lot of viruses. There's often no point in taking an anti-viral and that's why they're not as commonly prescribed as say antibiotics. Viruses are just a completely different ballgame. I was hospitalized with a very severe case of mono at one point and even though the infection desiese expert that was treating me said anti-virals don't work on mono, he prescribed and had me take one anyway just to be on the safe side. So I don't think there is any hesitation for doctors to prescribe them, there's just often no point.

	<TITLE> What're your thoughts on where Heyward will be in the batting order? What's your projected opening day lineup? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-25 01:11:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's mine:
Matt Carpenter 3B
Jon Jay CF
Matt Holliday LF
Matt Adams 1B
Johnny Peralta SS
Jason Heyward RF
Yadier Molina C
Kolten Wong 2B
Adam Wainwright P

I'm somewhat at a loss as to what the lineup will be and this is the best I can figure because I think they'll want to, since they lack power so much, try to get some of his power back by hitting him lower in the order. In my opinion, you could place Peralta, Adams, and Heyward in 4, 5, 6 in any order really. Maybe they'll move Adams lower down to remove some pressure from him hoping to get better performance? I just really am kind of at a loss. What're your thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So we know that Jesus' atonement covers all of God's children on his worlds without number. 
But then in 2 Nephi 9:21 it says: 

"And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam."

Wouldn't "the family of Adam" only be people on this Earth? So if he only suffered the pains of the people on this earth, how does his atonement cover all of God's children?  </TEXT>

Anyways, he then said "There's so much evidence piling up. Joseph Smith, when walking across Missouri said 'we are walking on sacred ground. We are walking on battlefields of the Book of Mormon.' And a huge amount of bones have been found where they were walking. In fact, they [JS and whoever else was with him] could see bones of huge masses of people sticking out of the ground."  </TEXT>
