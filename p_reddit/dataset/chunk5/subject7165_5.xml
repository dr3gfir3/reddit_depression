	<TITLE> Exactly how influential is Fox News on the electorate? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Neoliberals prefer evidence-based policy and discussion.

Why does it seem that the impression of many neoliberals concerning Fox News is totally out of whack with the *evidence* of the power and reach of Fox News (the evidence is 1) the ratings, and 2) viewer demographics.)

It is not uncommon for my neoliberal friends to ascribe all manner of ills to Fox News.  They say "the influence of Fox News CANNOT be overstated."  (why, yes, it can.)  I also know of another quite well-educated and articulate person who is convinced that "over half the country only gets its news from Fox News."  If that were true, then Fox News would have a viewership base of 150 million people!  

The way I see it, Fox News has a viewership of about 3 million people, the vast majority, if not all, of them are right wing conservatives anyway.  Fox News is not "influencing" -- and certainly not brainwashing -- any liberal, moderate, or undecided voters.  Furthermore, these 3 millions of viewers amount to less than 1% of the U.S. population.  MTV in the 1980's reached a higher percentage of viewers than that!  (I bring up MTV since it WAS a genuine cultural phenomenon in the 1980's.)

Am I wrong?  What are your evidence-based thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man is this thing creepy or what? Totes not appropriate for small kids or a low dose of LSD whoa!

Man did that big head freak you the fuck out or what, man?  Damn.  What if you were like on a low dose of mescalin or disassociatives?  This thing totally freaked me out man!!  Creepy music and creepy big heads.

Did you have any idea this was an Irish-British co-production?  I thought something that silly with the big hipster head would have to have been from the United States.  But it wasn't silly at all -- it was really freaky!!

And this was directed by the same chap who directed The Room (2003).  Is that wild!? </TEXT>

In a black SS wit a navigation

See the black blazion, something smells amazing
I gotta chick rolling up half black and Asian

Another one paging telling me to come over
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone

I used the v-12 powers, weight loss powers
From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower

Get a room in trump towers just to hit for 3 hours
Get the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours </TEXT>
