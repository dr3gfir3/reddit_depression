	<TEXT> There were [German Jews who backed Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_German_National_Jews).  They thought he was only "stirring up the masses" on the Jewish question, and agreed with him on kicking out foreigners, like East European Jews who they thought gave German Jews a bad name.  Donald is not Hitler, nor is Jared an antisemite.  But what they are playing with is stirring up the kind of nationalism that does not have a happy ending.  There is no such thing as a pure American.  We are a mongrel people, proud of it, and willing to fight those who want to deny our diversity.  "Stirring up the masses" on behalf of Christian White Nationalism is reactionary utopianism.  It is a battlecry for losers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The change in servers and devices meant some emails were not saved but remained in the slack space of the previous ones. That led to the painstaking undertaking of piecing together millions of email fragments like a jigsaw puzzle, Mr. Comey said, and ultimately proved that she had not turned over all of her work-related email to the State Department as she and her aides have claimed.
Three emails that were recovered also contained classified information, one secret and two confidential. Mr. Comey strongly suggested that others might be lost to the public record for good...

	<TEXT> David Brooks sets up a false dichotomy: Do we defend an open society, or retreat behind walls? The answer to Brooks question, of course, is simple. If we are to survive, we cant go retrograde.  Its too late to close borders, and act as if the rest of the world didnt matter.  Isolation is suffocation. But the real question, which Brooks and the political class refuse to address, is: Globalization for whom?

The decline of the middle class (formerly known as the working class) in Europe and the United States is not due to immigration. It is a reflection of unsustainable inequality globally.  Uncontested capitalism, following its own inner logic, is equalizing income for the 99%.  We in the old developed world are experiencing our weakening bargaining power. Concentrated wealth is the winner -- and winner takes all.

If we are to survive, we need a new kind of globalization based on common human imperatives: to combat global warming, to live within the planet's resource limits, and to forestall the massive displacement of populations. Capitalist incentives work against achieving these survival goals.

It is becoming painfully clear that finance capitalism has failed. For the 99%, it destroys more value than it creates.  Its price for organizing production is more than we can afford.  A new mechanism is needed for the allocation of our limited resources to meet real needs  especially for the public goods that make communities viable and worth living in.

David, it's our turn now. 

The problem that underlies the rising tide of revolt across the globe is not globalization, but the failure of capitalism to produce the economy that the people of this planet need to survive.

Building the economy that we need would shift the distribution of income towards real productive actors -- labor, innovators, organizers -- and away from the engineers of financial products and illusions.

Globalization for the 99% has its own logic:  

- Sustainable economies must depend on maintaining and incorporating intact communities. Most people want to live in place, and not be wrenched away from their homes and cultures.  In a sustainable world, immigration would remain, but as a personal choice, not driven by economic necessity.    

- We must invent new paths by which we can all live in our own way, within our planetary means. We must move consciously and deliberately towards material equality.  Life would be different, but we can live well.
  
- Most of all, we must get beyond the wasteland of war.  We cant win, and neither can they, in a ruined planet. We need to mobilize all of our resources and efforts right now to build an economy that can combat global warming.

Neither business-as-usual capitalist globalization nor tribal retrenchment are viable alternatives.  A program based in meeting real needs no longer represents an idealistic goal. It is a minimum requirement for the survival of peace, democracy, and life itself.

	<TEXT> If we are to survive, we cant go retrograde.  Its too late to close all the borders, and live as if the rest of the world didnt matter.  Isolation is suffocation.  

We are embedded in a planet which is at great risk.  We are hitting the long term consequences of unaccountable power.   Climate change and winner-take-all inequality are disintegrating the fabric of the old order.

We have the opportunity to act.  But not alone.  Indeed, we are now forced to save the world in order to save ourselves. 

The refugee crisis that has unhinged Europe is a reflection of a rising disorder fueled by global warming. The Arab Spring, and especially the Syrian civil war, followed a long drought that drove up food prices, and exposed old-line dictators to revolutionary unrest.  

Addressing the underlying crisis will require a new kind of globalization: to combat global warming; to re-tool and develop so that we can all live within the planet's resource limits; and to forestall the further displacement of populations.  

Capitalist incentives work against these survival goals.  Business-as-usual political economy  the offer you cant refuse  is proclaimed as the way the world works.  But it has no answers. 

Movements, like the one that mobilized behind Bernie Sanders, are our only hope to force the adoption of policies that lead to a sustainable future.  We must mobilize within our own countries, but our program must be post-national.

Before we can summon the will to make this democratic political revolution happen, we must be conscious of who we are, and who are our natural allies.  We are the 99% who have been suckered into acquiescence by a system that promised us a better tomorrow.  They lied.  

We need all of us to recognize that we have been had, and to understand that the decline of the middle class (formerly known as the working class) in Europe and the United States is not due to immigration. It is a reflection of unsustainable inequality, worldwide.  Capitalism is equalizing living conditions for the 99% globally.  That minimizes production costs.  We in the lands where wealth is concentrated find our bargaining power is continually weakening.  The share of income going to concentrated wealth is getting larger and larger.  Thats not a conspiracy.  Its just the inexorable logic of capital doing its thing: profit-maximization. (Socialism is dead,  and, no longer fearing an alternative, theres no longer a need for capital to put on a human face.)

What is needed is a democratic globalization that moves towards equality at the expense of concentrated wealth. That would start to resolve many currently insolvable problems. 

Over time it would mean reducing American and European use of material resources to their proportional share of global population. Life would be different, but, if it embodies conscious choice, our life experience would be richer in meaning, more humanly satisfying.  If we make conscious choices about what we value, we can all live well.  Measuring our wealth in human terms, we can have the time, and sense of purpose, to lead rich cultural lives, respecting our differences, and each others right to exist.  Most of all, we must get beyond the wasteland of war.  We cant afford it.  We need all of our resources and efforts to build an economy that can combat global warming.

Most people want to live in place, and not be wrenched away from their homes and cultures.  In a sustainable world, immigration would remain, but as a personal choice, not driven by economic necessity.    

Building the economy that we need will shift the distribution of income towards real productive actors -- labor, innovators, organizers -- and away from the engineers of financial products and illusions.  It will take labor trained for new tasks, and new technologies (whose availability must not be held back to profit patent-holders).  Finance capitalism has failed.  Money is a social construction.  It must be managed to create investments that meet real needs  especially for the public goods that make communities worth living in.   

A program based in meeting real needs at home and abroad no longer represents an idealistic goal.  It is a minimum requirement for the survival of peace and democracy in Europe, the U.S., and other centers of concentrated wealth.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now the power of the people cannot be dismissed. Legitimate grievances, unaddressed, have consequences. Unfortunately there is no business-as-usual solution. Even if Trump is beaten back this time, and Clinton lands the Presidency, there is no safe harbor. The political climate for the next election will be even stormier (as will the atmospheric climate) unless underlying issues are addressed.

What must we do to get out of the trap we are in? Do we need to experience another financial meltdown to make clear that old answers are bankrupt? Or can we think our way into a better future before we are ruined again?   Real needs require real answers. So what do we need?

The decline of the middle class (formerly known as the working class) in Europe and the United States is not due to immigration.  It is a reflection of unsustainable inequality globally, which capitalism is equalizing for the 99%, while our weakening bargaining power means that concentrated wealth is the winner -- and winner takes all.

What is needed is a democratic globalization that moves towards equality at the expense of concentrated wealth. That would resolve many currently insolvable problems.  Over time it would mean reducing American and European use of material resources to their proportional share of global population.  But we can all live well if we build the economy we need to combat global warming.

A sustainable world would allow people to live in place, not wrench them away from their homes and cultures. This cannot be done overnight, but we must start moving in the right direction -- away from disintegration. Building economies to live within global resource limits will take generations. It will take labor trained for new tasks, and new technologies (whose availability must not be held back to profit patent-holders). Building the economy that we need will shift the distribution of income towards real productive actors -- labor, innovators, organizers -- and away from the engineers of financial products and illusions.

A program based in meeting real needs no longer represents an idealistic goal. It is a minimum requirement for the survival of peace and democracy in Europe, the U.S., and other centers of concentrated wealth.

A social compact existed in the postwar world which protected great wealth in countries like the US, UK, and much of the EU.  An acquiescent people who accepted great inequality was bought,  albeit reluctantly, by sharing some of the benefits of wealth with the majority.  That compact is now broken. Wealth no longer feels it needs the protection of any people. The Cold War has been won, and wealth is free to go anywhere, and get away from workers and laws which are costly. The Cold War was always about making sure that there is no alternative to capitalism. More than Communism, the threats that had to be destroyed were independent movements for democratic sovereignty -- from Guatemala and Iran in the 1950s, to Greece only a year ago. 

The goal has always been a business-friendly world, safe for the globalization we have today.  In the past, when markets and production were mainly nation-bound, workers could organize, and use the state to get a better deal from capital. Now people who previously thought they were secure, are pitted against immigrants, and workers elsewhere. But it is too late for them to be saved by shutting borders.

If we are to survive, we need a new kind of globalization: to combat global warming, to live within the planet's resource limits, and to prevent the displacement of populations. Capitalist incentives work against these survival goals.

Capitalist incentives  do not offer an efficient mechanism to produce what we need. Too much gets siphoned off to those at the center of financial power.   If we don't adopt a program for survival, we will descend, step by step, into a war of all against all.  Mrs. Clinton will only learn that lesson after she realizes that she and the people around her are not in control of the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to the most recent MergerWatch report, the number of public short-term acute care hospitals in the U.S. dropped an astonishing 34 percent between 2001 and 2016. The number of secular nonprofit hospitals, too, shrunk by 11 percent, while for-profit systems shot up by more than 50 percent. In rural areas, where it is harder to turn a profit, these trends have left tremendous disparities in health care access.
Catholic hospitals help fill some of that gap  but at what cost? The ACLUs Brigitte Amiri worries that hospitals fealty to the directives over the standard of care means that for some, the delta between the services they seek and those that are available is becoming a gulf. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have always needed immigration. We still do. Immigrants need a welcoming community. Syrians, fleeing an ongoing holocaust, need a home. What do people who are blind to the suffering of others deserve? Pity? Contempt? Or only to remain unnoticed when they themselves are in need. 

We know what is right, but Americans increasingly feel that they are in a losing battle as workers.  Some get high rewards (especially in the financial sector), but most have lost bargaining power, and work-life is precarious.  We have been pitted against each other, against immigrants, and against workers in other countries. In the face of lost futures, we are descending into a war of all-against-all.  That's not a choice.  That's not a way to live a good life. 

The key to welcoming immigrants (especially people whose survival is at stake) is to build an America that meets real needs and is sustainable. That requires conscious choice, purposeful action, and, yes, clear policy choices made by our elected government. There's more than enough work that must be done if we are to achieve that goal. That would make America great again in spirit. But we must (as Bernie Sanders says) think big. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Air Force bought tons of contaminated tomatoes from local fields that the Spanish public refused to eat. To assure the public there was no danger, commanders fed the tomatoes to the troops. Though the risk from eating plutonium is much lower than the risk from inhaling it, it is still not safe.
Breakfast, lunch and dinner. We had them until we were sick of them, said Wayne Hugart, 74, who was a military police officer at the site. They kept saying there was nothing wrong with them.
In all, the Air Force cut down 600 acres of crops and plowed under the contaminated dirt. Troops scooped up 5,300 barrels of soil from the most radioactive areas near the craters and loaded the barrels on ships to be buried in a secure nuclear waste storage site in South Carolina.
Spanish and American authorities assured villagers that they had nothing to fear. The villagers, accustomed to living in a dictatorship, did little to protest. Even if some people here might have wanted to know more, Franco was in charge, so everybody was too scared to ask anything, said Antonio Latorre, a villager who is now 78.
To assure villagers their homes were safe, the Air Force sent young airmen into local houses with hand-held radiation detectors. Peter M. Ricard, then a 20-year-old cook with no training on the equipment, remembers being told to perform scans of anything locals wanted, but to keep his detector turned off.
We were just supposed to feign our readings so we didnt cause turmoil with the natives, he said in an interview. I often think about that now. I wasnt too smart back then. They say do it and you just say, Yes, sir. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heres the comment that I submitted (it would have been longer, but got truncated by their message character limit):

America's economic future depends on making a successful transition to renewable energy.  High-Volume Horizontal Hydraulic Fracturing (fracking) would undercut that future by investing in a short-term get-rich toxic sidetrack.

Fracking is a bubble that has burst.  See some recent articles:

[Oil and Gas Exploration Bankruptcies Could Sextuple This Year](
http://fortune.com/2016/03/25/fracking-bankruptcies/)
 
[U.S. Fracking: Drilling Stalls as firms head for bankruptcy](
http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2016/02/08/us-fracking-is-having-troubles/)

[Fracking Collapses, Production Soars, No Bottom Yet in Oil Bust](
http://davidstockmanscontracorner.com/fracking-collapses-production-soars-no-bottom-yet-in-oil-bust/)

 Adequate regulations" would drive frackers out of business: Paying the full cost for the adverse consequences of fracking would make the practice unprofitable.  

For regulations to be truly protective, the profit incentive to violate rules must be eliminated.  At a minimum, limited liability entities must purchase insurance to cover the full potential damage that their actions could cause.  Enforcement efforts must be robust, and never compromised by fiscal stringency.  Fracking operators must pay these costs.  And enforcement agents must have incentives to stay independent, with no prospect of being captured by the regulated.  That requires total economic separation, before and after working to enforce the rule.  The assessment of adverse impacts should be an ongoing function, leading to periodic updating of the regulations.  

For all these reasons, none of the proposed regulations of fracking have offered an adequate defense of public health and the environment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The capital-intensity of shale oil production means that, over the course of the life for each extraction site, a critical calculation must be made before any new investment is made: that future prices will cover production costs and yield a profitable return on the initial investment.  That risk calculation has now shifted and the dial has turned from greed to fear. Low-cost existing producers of conventional oil, like the Saudis, would rather pump it all out now, before carbon taxes and caps are imposed, before solar becomes even more competitive, and before electric vehicles lead us into a driverless tomorrow.  Global economic stagnation further sours prospects.  Capital would rather play in the unreal world of speculative financial products than place its stake on a profit-challenged future.  </TEXT>

As in all human relations, mutuality, reciprocity, and respect, are the basis for justice and peace.  We can decide that the only question is to protect our own.  We can point to the crimes committed against the innocents within our own group, and determine to eliminate the Other as the source of the crime.  That is the route of endless war and, ultimately, our mutual self-destruction.  Or, we can decide to have a future in which we share a fragile world that needs our attention if any of us are to survive (think of global warming, but that's not the only existential threat). Do we want a future?  That is the question.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (The attack) has all the markers of both an unconscionable hate crime and an act of terrorism on a scale we have not before witnessed in America, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.
This heinous attack on a nightclub serving the LGBTQ community is yet another reminder of the serious threat posed by the Islamic State terrorist group, which has inspired attacks against Jews in Belgium, journalists in France, civilians in San Bernardino and now LGBTQ men and women in America.
Greenblatt cautioned that Americans should not blame all Muslims for the actions of one individual. Whether citizens like the individual suspected of committing this act or war-torn refugees seeking safety, we must remember that we do not define people by their faith. We are deeply concerned that this attack could lead to a backlash against American Muslims. We urge all Americans to not fight hatred with hatred, but rather to come together around our common values of decency and respect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Mr. Trump succeeded in repeatedly convincing investors, bankers and Wall Street that his name had real value.
They were so in love with him that they came back a second, third and fourth time, Mr. Hanlon said. They let him strip out assets. It was awful to watch. It was astonishing. I have to give Trump credit for using his celebrity time and time again.
In 2014, the casino company filed for bankruptcy protection for the fifth time. The chief executive cited the debt level after the 2009 bankruptcy as the primary reason.
For a time, Mr. Trump lent a glamorous sheen to the faded resort city. But some of his former investors no longer see the value.
People underestimated Donald Trumps ability to pillage the company, said Sebastian Pignatello, a private investor who at one time held stock in the Trump casinos worth more than $500,000. He drove these companies into bankruptcy by his mismanagement, the debt and his pillaging. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The move away from fossil fuel to renewable energy requires not only the generation of power but also the full range of capital, maintenance, and management structures to make systemic change work efficiently.  These include energy storage to maintain the balance between supply and demand.  The transmission-distribution system is itself part of efficient energy storage-utilization.  Increased energy efficiency in final use, and demand management to match demand with supply, must also be part of the mix to minimize cost.  So current imbalances should be seen not as failings, but as indicators of new bottlenecks and barriers which must be addressed as a new renewable energy ecosystem establishes itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not a liberal.  There's another way to think about America, the world, and the future.  It means that the past can't be kept intact, but we can make the best of the world as it is becoming. Let's change the subject so that we can solve the problem. Climate change and building sustainable economies are the conjoined challenges that will dominate this century. Immigration is only a major aspect of a larger set of issues. 

Syrian refugees are the lead wave of the coming tide of climate refugees.
Climate change and the loss of habitability in the Middle East is a primary cause for states to fail, descending into conflict, and an independent force pushing refugees to flee the region. None of the actors will survive an unmitigated climate disaster. If we are to avert a migration disaster, we must start by finding a resolution for the Syrian bloodbath. Finding a way to make Syria livable would demonstrate what must be done over the course of this century. Failure now prefigures a devastating future. The current ceasefire in Syria is a frail effort at de-escalating the conflict. But for negotiations to be fruitful, they must envision a future set of conditions in which current constituencies must come to terms with each other. They will need to modify what they each hope to obtain in the light of challenges which are not solely political. They will have to recognize that they need each other in order to counter a greater threat. Responses designed to allow Syrians, Iraqis, and others in the region to live in their historic homelands provide an alternative vision that has a chance of addressing an unfolding catastrophe, while resolving civil conflict and stanching the flow of refugees. Any program for sustainability will have to be funded. The U.S. and Europe, as well as the wealthy oil producing states, must all contribute to such an effort.

Starting in the Middle East, we must take immediate action that will prepare and employ people for the demands of this century. We need new ways that are different from what any of us have known -- relations between people and with nature which must be determined by people in their own communities in their own way. 

And for those who are the diaspora thrown out of their homelands by the failed states that have accompanied failed economies, we must also find answers -- including in the U.S. We have always needed immigration. We still do. Immigrants need a welcoming community. Syrians, fleeing an ongoing holocaust, need a home. What do people who are blind to the suffering of others deserve? Pity? Contempt? Or only to remain unnoticed when they themselves are in need. We know what is right, but American workers have been pitted against each other, and against immigrants. In the face of lost futures, divisions become more prominent. The key to welcoming immigrants (especially people whose survival is at stake) is to build an America that meets real needs and is sustainable. There's more than enough work that must be done if we are to achieve that goal. That would make America great again in spirit. But we must (as Bernie Sanders says) think big.

Our claimed right to exclude others is based on fear of difference, fear of change.  It has a price.  When we deny the creative power unleashed by our diversity, we deny what has made America great.  Give Exclusion the power to rule, and the circle of inclusion will get ever-narrower.  It is the beginning of an endless war against ourselves.  The alternative is embracing openness -- becoming different from what we started out as being.  It is the process of creating ourselves, including not only our past, but those of others, to build a future that embodies our choices and transcends our fears.   </TEXT>

Opponents, mostly pharmaceutical companies based outside California, have poured $68.4 million to defeat the measure.

The California Drug Price Relief Act would only allow government health programs to ink contracts with drugmakers at prices that are the same or lower than those paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which usually gets steep discounts from manufacturers. But Big Pharma isnt having it.... For references sake, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which supports the initiative, raised $4.4 million.... California spent more than $4.2 billion on drugs in fiscal 2015, according to the Bloomberg story, so its no surprise that the state is taking pharma to task over drug pricing. The ballot initiative recently gained support from vocal drug price critic and presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So why doesnt Venezuela just default on its foreign debt and force Wall Street creditors to renegotiate more favorable terms? Venezuela may have a lot to lose in a default, too. Its foreign debt is partly owed by the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, the countrys principal generator of revenue. Venezuelan officials fear that a default would bring bondholder lawsuits. That could severely disrupt PDVSAs operations and result in seizures of the companys overseas assets  perhaps even from its Houston subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum Corporation, which owns three big refineries and has thousands of  gas stations.  Citgo is vital for Venezuela because it generates much of the oil revenue that the country is still receiving.

	<TEXT> In letters to investors in 2014, Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners expressed confidence that Greece would soon be on the path to a sustainable recovery. But by the end of that year, Eaglevales leaders began to acknowledge that their perspective on the situation in Greece may have been wrong. The fund had earlier stopped taking in new money.

The problem with the Clinton family is not so much that they are corrupt tools of financialized world capitalism (i.e., Goldman Sachs), but that they actually believe the ideology -- that austerity is the necessary medicine that restores economic health.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems that some Democrats are terrified that establishment policies will be the loser in a Trump-Sanders debate.  They do not understand that those policies have already lost.  The question in a Trump-Sanders debate is: who has a credible alternative.  Trump must do better than bluster.  American Strongman Donald Trump does not have the answer.  Sanders must also make his positive vision believable.  Increasing inequality sucks money from working people.  Trump has no answer to keep that crushing from continuing.  Sanders' program for reconstructing the American economy for sustainability in the 21st Century would provide the stimulus needed to meet real needs. Retooling America and the world to handle the climate crisis is this century's alternative to war economy, except it doesn't waste resources -- it saves them.  New Deal Democrats would have embraced his program.  Can he go beyond canned phrases and really make his case?  This could be a debate worth watching.    </TEXT>

In addition, the reach of the program has been greatly reduced.
In 1996, for every 100 families in poverty, 68 received cash assistance. That fell to 23 for every 100 in 2014. And in a dozen states including Arizona, the number is fewer than 10 in 100. </TEXT>

It's complex. School staff must use their common sense and humanity to judge whether an assertion of gender identity is serious and worthy of recognition. The alternative to complexity is a one-size-fits-all Procrustean "solution". The one chosen by benighted states like North Carolina solves the problem by making transgendered people's lives impossible to live. No transgenders -- No problem. Of course that logic extends to all forms of otherness. Some of us feel most free when everybody is exactly the same. Other people accept the burden of diversity which allows a much greater range for the free spirit of humanity to express itself in the world. That choice defines a society. People who cherish diversity tend to live in interesting places. Of course, they have the attendant problem: they have the responsibility of finding out who they really are, rather than just doing what their parents and community tell them they must do.

Roy Cohn is a figure in American history who is well known to people at least of our generation, probably not so much to the one thats casting a lot of ballots now. But Roy Cohn was the sidekick and chief witch hunter for Senator Joseph McCarthy, a guy who reminds a lot of people of Ted Cruz. You know, they both look alike, and they talk alike. And after Royafter Roy Cohn had left the Senate, he went into private practice, and he set himself up basically as the house counsel to a couple of the crime bosses in New York Citythe Genovese crime family and the Gambino crime family. And at the same time, he adopted a young developer from Queens looking to make his first mark as a developer in Manhattan named Donald J. Trump. And Donald J. Trump will tell you, to this day, that he learned how to play politics and he learned how to play development from Roy Cohn, while he was sitting in Roy Cohns East Side townhouse next to "Fat Tony" Salerno and "Big Paul" Castellano. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shiller's theory of swings in the economy is psychology-driven.  There is no doubt that panics and "irrational exuberance" are amplified by social-psychological mood-swings.  But there is no room in his theory to recognize a real global economy as the underlying structure that both constrains and predisposes the subjective states which interest him.  The housing bubble did not burst because people were suddenly told there was a bubble, and believed it.  Many analysts were crying "bubble" for years, and dismissed as alarmists, until the bubble cracked by itself.  Loss of confidence when you are aware that the floor has dropped out from under you cannot be restored by closing your eyes and saying "I Believe Everything's Fine."    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He points out the degree to which the party has become captive to economic elites whose agendas dont necessarily represent the rest of Americas. Mr. Sanders, who raised more than $200 million through small donations, even cast doubt on Democrats claims that they need big-money backers to succeed.

The Stockholm Syndrome is when captives, held for a long time, identify with their captors.  It's a short-term survival mechanism that becomes habit, and then a way of life.  Clinton corporate Democrats orient towards existing power.  They see their role as supplicants, negotiating out of weakness, always working within the framework of corporate rule, selling policies, like healthcare, as a great business plan for Big Pharma and the insurance industry.  What they have always had to sell is their ability to assure consent of the people. They told us not to struggle, just trust them to speak for us.  Bernie's opened the escape hatch.  A lot of people are no longer in the herd.  Now they have to figure out how to continue to act together, finding the means as well as the will to wrest back their democratic power.
