Is there proof that the DNC *didn't* work against Bernie? No, because what could that even possibly be? 

Is there proof that they did? None that I've heard, besides out-of-context, overblown emails which aren't proof of anything in and of themselves.  </TEXT>

FTFY. 

I swear, I'm on my early 20s and I doubt I'll ever be able to trust those who label themselves as Republican. If that party doesn't wither away and something else take its place, like a new Conservative party, there's going to be a generation of people who distrust every word anyone on the Right says.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best analogy I can think of for Republican and Democratic politicians is cats and dogs. 

Dems tend not to attack unless they feel their family (community) are being threatened, or unless personally provoked/threatened. Like dogs.

Republicans attack for fun or for personal gain, constantly, even if there's no real reason for it. Like cats.

3/5 of the time when dog walks by my roommate's cat she just lets her pass. 1/5 the time, she'll hiss and spit a threat. The other fifth, she swipes her claws at the innocent dog. For no fucking reason. That's how I see Republicans, but worse, because Republicans seem to attack at every given opportunity, and even invent extra opportunities.   </TEXT>

Sexual orientation *is a part of your identity,* whether you realize it or not. If the government strikes LGBT people from the census, it makes it easier for them to stop protecting them from discrimination and hate crimes.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's the result of ignoring orientation in the census? 

LGBT people are not recognized by the census. 

The world we live in considers heterosexual to be the default, and straight people outnumber LGBT by quite a lot. No one is going to assume that everyone is gay. People are much more likely to assume that the portion of LGBT people in the population is zero or close enough to zero that it's not worth reporting. 

This is just a way to other-ize the LGBT community.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclaimer: I'm an American, so feel free to dismiss literally anything I say that's wrong. I just had some thoughts on your comment. 

Our civil war was over 150 years ago. It is the only war we've ever fought within our own borders (I'm not counting the Revolution as they weren't yet "our" borders then). It was a war started by one side's insistence on ignoring human rights and belief in racial supremacy. It's not a perfect comparison by any means, but it's not bad, either. 

That war was the most costly in American lives and it caused division and pain so deep that the country still hasn't recovered fully  one side of my family still resents the other for being northerners. And slavery will *always* stain American race relations, at least for the foreseeable future. A few months shy of 152 years and it is still there. 

Basically, I don't think it'll ever *not* be part of the social fabric of Europe, but it doesn't have to be a dark cloud hanging over always.  </TEXT>

Only because the people killed there, or at least their survivors, would probably prefer to be remembered in another way. They were people, after all, and people are more complicated than how they die. 

I think the camps are more like monuments than memorials; monuments to the incredible cruelty humans are capable of. 

Regardless, it's a place you need to be wholly respectful while visiting. It's a somber place, so maybe shithead kids should learn basic human decency before desecrating it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Best rebuttal to Holocaust denialism I've heard is: if it didn't happen, why did the defendants at Nuremberg only deny their complicity or responsibility for the mass murder of innocents instead of simply saying "this did not happen?" 

"I was only following orders" is a very different sentiment than "no such thing even occurred." Those men were on trial for their lives, so if the Holocaust hadn't happened, they *definitely* would've said so. By using "orders" as an excuse, it is reasonable to assume they weren't so steadfast in their anti-Semitism and Nazi beliefs that they'd die to protect a conspiracy that horrifying.

	<TEXT> I'm on Adderall, which is a controlled substance. Quantities are strictly regulated by the prescribers, pharmacies, and insurance companies, and exceptions really aren't made because it's a heavily abused drug. If I were to fill a prescription two weeks early, I could get into trouble with my insurance or even law enforcement, since I live in a college town where ADHD drugs are one of the most often abused prescriptions. 

If I were even able to get a script filled, yeah, it'd be a money problem. D: </TEXT>

Iowa is a beautiful and important agricultural as well as scholastic state (provided the state legislature doesn't fuck that up), and I hate that it's being represented by... Morons. And bigots. 

I get that outside of voting and organizing, it's hard to do much to help, and it sucks being called these names when you're not the demo that elected him. I'm in Arizona and have been called a bigot for being white during the HB-1070 bullshit a few years back. All you really can do is refute the accusations and live in a way that demonstrates who you actually are.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What a warm and supportive reply, thanks! :) I would never poke fun at a legitimately upset child, and I was the recipient of many sarcastic quips from my father both now and as a kid. I think playful teasing from parents is a good thing. It makes the kid acknowledge that their parents (and the world at large) can see through the drama without becoming angry. 

I hope I can be a good mother one day, and it's really nice to see comments like yours.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not who you were talking to but it's literally one of my top 10 movies ever. Mel Brooks is a comedic genius. His movies poke fun at innocuous, random demographics that no one ever mentions (the swipe at Methodists in Blazing Saddles makes my grandpa, a former Methodist minister, roar with laughter), and uses offensive humor as a jab at bigots rather than minorities by presenting it as a negative side effect of ignorance rather than a statement of fact. 

Seriously, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, The Producers (both versions, for different reasons), Men in Tights, and Spaceballs are some of the funniest movies in existence. Mel also created Get Smart. 

And Mel's son Max wrote World War Z (the novel), which I love. 

Okay, I'll stop raving about this like a freak now.    </TEXT>

And my dad was always sarcastic when I got upset as a young'un, saying things like "yes, you've just got the hardest life ever" when I cried over this or that, and all it really did was introduce me to the fact that I'm *really* privileged. I also credit him with my dry sense of humor and smart mouth. I'd be okay passing all that down... although maybe not the smart mouth, considering what a turd I could be back in high school.

	<TEXT> That's good to hear. Because my mom was a teacher and I spent a lot of time in her classroom as a kid, the mom/teacher face stopped affecting me early on (even though she rarely used it on me, I was a well-behaved kid). But I've seen it silently stop a rowdy classful of students in their tracks on many occasions. 

That being said, I was the kid teachers wrote "I wish I had a class full of her" on report cards about, since I was quiet and did my work and liked to read, so mom/teacher face immunity didn't matter. 

I'm no-nonsense as well, but I do love the crap out of my students and would easily step in front of a bullet for any of them. I get annoyed when a student tells me "you're mean" because I'm truly not and the kid has no manners. I wouldn't have dared say something like that to a teacher at any point in my childhood. 

Anyhow, it's good to know that being no-nonsense doesn't make me a cruel caregiver. I do want kids one day, and I don't want to screw them up emotionally *too much*.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 21 and I perfected my mom face before I left high school, and it does wonders with the kids at work. But I think maybe my take-no-shit attitude has something to do with the fact that I routinely have to deal with up to 100 kids, half of whom are breaking school rules, and one of them sulking in the corner is not what I want to focus on at any given time. 

But can I just say that mom-face is an incredible superpower? I almost feel bad that my mom raised kids who became immune to it by middle school.  </TEXT>
