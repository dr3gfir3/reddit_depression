	<TEXT> I think you mean Hoysala Empire. More prominent. 
But karnatakans are not even close to as prominent as the below:

Mauryan? Delhi Sultanate? Marathas with Shivaji? Nanda? Chalukya? Tughlaqs?

Even Palas and Cholas for that matter.

When we already have Indian, I guess there is no point of another Civ. There has been endless Empires in India, can't re-create all of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi All

Mostly, Hi to all 'Big' tournament Organizers out there, how about organizing a tournament (Talk to MS about this for funding, Zack?) on HD (Even Voobly is fine but then those players won't get to see new Civs and Architecture). Try to reach them, talk to them, interview them, and request them for one comeback.

This can be huge, it will create more interest in the game than ever, even fans of those players from early 2000s will come back, watch the tournament and get inspired to play. Obviously, mix the tournament with current top players. [MS gains? We gain?]

My choices - Koven, Halen, Jordan, Capoch, kkab, Chris, Grunt, Ruso, Iori, Viper, Riut, DauT, Tim, Yo, Slam....(Around 15 odd players)

Your thoughts?

	<TEXT> Elephants (Elephas Maximus) came into existence in India, Sri Lanka, China, Bangladesh before other South Asian countries. 

Elephants came into existence in Africa too, but some years(centuries!) later..

At one time, African elephants inhabited the whole of the African continent. Now they are found only south of the Sahara, due to shrinking habitat and the effects of mans presence (namely the ivory trade).  </TEXT>

It would do stuff like Douche with Persians, crazy Trush with Teutons, come forward with villagers and palisade wall your base, or stone wall your gold and stone! TT will be the most unpredictable AI, and even Experts who play by the book will feel uncomfy playing TT.

That said, we as spectators really suffered because of the Lags and the Restores. But we kept at it because the games were great and the stage was great.
