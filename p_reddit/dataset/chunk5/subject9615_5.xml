	<TEXT> I just got done watching an ep. from The Americans that was simply amazing and yet it was like 43 minutes long. So much happens in that episode. TWD, on the other hand (a show I love deeply) seems to pack a lot less in those 43 minutes. Why is that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who just got an Xbox One S, I admit I'm a little jealous and I would be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind to return it and get a  ps4 lol. TLOU is my favorite Ps3 game hands down.  But I'm willing to be patient and see if I can get one for cheap in 2019 or 2020 </TEXT>

I was planning on replaying it but I just kind of went on to play other games. Now that I got an Xbox One I remembed I still have the game case with the second disc intact. I just started playing and I'm excited that I get to relieve the whole experience since I've mostly forgotten what happened. Then I'm getting wicther 3 </TEXT>
