____________________________________

I left for some Taco Bell and a pick-up at 8:30 tonight, when I left the door to my dorm (which needs one specific key card to get in, mine or the RA's or school) was locked. I know this because when I came back around 9:45, I had to unlock it to get in. 

When I leave, I always leave my grinder and bong on my desk/window seat, in plain sight if you're in the room. You can't see out of my window because the shade is closed and a fan is blowing out, blocking the bottom view. 

My bong and grinder were missing when I came back. I do not misplace things easily. I feel weird knowing someone was possibly in my room. 

-edit- There were no notifications, through email or anything, about room searches. There was no notice left or anything.

TLDR; My bong and grinder are missing from a locked dorm after I left for an hour. What gives? Any suggestions?

Sincerely,
A sad ent </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take Effexor, and have been for almost a year now. I can confirm anything weird is because of Effexor. I call those eye movement sensations "zaps" and they always come on if you're behind on a dose. 

Always be careful with your routine and you should be fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it makes you feel better, I had the same experience as you growing up, except I didn't start smoking every day until I was 17, and I got diagnosed with severe depression at 18 that I'll probably have to deal with for a long time. Which also stemmed from reasons being untreated personal issues and just being hard on myself academically. 

I am 90% sure that I would have gotten depression anyway, and although my marijuana usage has taken a toll on chemical balances in my brain, I think it was a way for me to deal with it, helping me deal with the present while my mind was thinking about the past and future. I also think dually, it exasperated the depression slightly, so basically it's a win-lose. 

The other 10% knows science hasn't completed its research yet.

	<TEXT> OKAY, for starters, I am not advocating that all parents should start smoking weed. They shouldn't.

My boyfriend and I smoke pot with his whole family. The mom, the dad, the little brother, and us. It's a lifestyle I've never really been introduced to before, besides smoking hookah with another buddy's parents. It's only been that way for a few years.

I'm a 19 year old female ENT. Come to think of it right now, I don't think pot smoking with/around your teenagers will really affect their well being. Around kids and infants though, I feel differently.

I feel like more parents should consider it. It's bonding to the extreme.

TLDR; What do you you guys think about family toke sessions? </TEXT>

Buddy. There IS a problem there. You two should love each other's company and really take advantage of it when you are together. Otherwise, you two should be missing each other apart. If this isn't happening, something is wrong, and someone's feelings aren't 100% in tune anymore. Take it from someone in a LDR. </TEXT>

-edit- Israel is it's own country too; it is an ally of the US, yes, but it's not going to attack someone just because the US wants them to. If the US wanted to take action, it wouldn't use Israel's military to do that, it has enough going on.  </TEXT>
