	<TEXT>  Although the pangolins scales are the most prominent symbol of that uniquenessno other mammal has themthe eight species all share several other physical and behavioral characteristics.

This is a direct quote. 

Edit for a few more direct quotes:

 Its a lucrative business with devastating consequences. Pangolins are prized both for their meat (and blood), which is considered a delicacy, and for their scales, which are used in traditional medicinesdespite the fact that pangolin scales are made of keratin, the same substance as human fingernails.

Oh another

Nguyen and IUCN reports suggest that you neednt look far to find pangolin meat being offered on restaurant menus and their scales being sold as remedies for everything from ulcers to acne, particularly in China and Vietnam. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fantastic. I really appreciate this. I'm getting offers for AD that I would never even look at, but with his team's bad season, I am catching myself considering them. 

Injury risk is something that I can live with but I can't stand the idea of them just making something up and then benching him for a few weeks.   </TEXT>
