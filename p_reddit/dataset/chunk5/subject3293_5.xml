	<TEXT> Asparagus patches takes 3 years before you can harvest, but then the plants lives for 20+ years. If you plan on being at your location for a long time,I would go mainly with perennials, as they come back year after year (versus annuals). Other perennials for zone 5: Jerusalem Artichoke and rhubarb. garlics and chives behave as perennials, as they come back each year.

Then, plant some fruit trees if you have the space! Apples would do great in zone 5! </TEXT>
