A lot of movies get made on the estranged father daughter theme, this is one of the better ones ;) Also, Nic cage (\m/) was amazing.

	<TEXT> You are right that is even more accurate i.e use the expansion for tan^(-1) x and compute upto 3 terms to get a good value by putting x as sqrt(1/2). In my previous comment, I was thinking more like tanx = sqrt(1/2)
thus, cosx = sqrt (2/3)
thus, 1-x^2 / 2 = sqrt(2/3)
thus, x = sqrt(2-sqrt(8/3))
thus, x~0.6 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not at all an accurate way, use expansion for cos x = 1-x^2 / 2, maybe to get a feel of where the value lies, here cosx = sqrt (2/3) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do not know much about the job market, but most schools teaching renewable energy have special courses for integration of renewables in the society. I think a psychology degree will be very useful in these cases. For eg. one of the things that hold BIPV is people think that the value of their houses will go down if they put PVs on top. So actually the technologies are all there, people just need to believe in them more. So  I would say if you enroll in some programs and look to marketing of renewables, your background won't go to waste. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My opinion :
1) POV - if the antagonist is the narrator, he already has the sympathies of the audience  irrespective of his moral code etc., I don't know why that is
2) Sympathy - If the anti-hero is the way he is because of the 
audience's (society's) actions even if passively
3)Justice/Fairness : Audience is often seen to forgive a character who takes the law in his hands to deliver justice, a bit out of context for the clockwork orange ofcourse. </TEXT>
