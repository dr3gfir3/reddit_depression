kill with lab man, thought lash mostly blanks eldrazi, excellent choice in heavy combo metas. 

it helps that your combo dodges chalice, and that you main counter-top.

millions of ways to win in response to stuff when you have the combo in play.

upgrade path to miracles and show and tell variants.

less linear than oops and belcher, doesnt die to counterbalance like high tide or reset tide.

cards that cost + $ 30 canadian : 4 force of will, 2 ancient tomb.

I wrote a primer in text form that I was told is comprehensive but hard to read.

	<TEXT> Look at the "decks to beat" on the source. Its easy to see metas where eldrazi and BR reanimator get wrecked. Or elves, or lands, or sneak show, or storm, or a half dozen other things I'm not thinking of.

These metas are common. Hell we lived in all of them at various points throughout 2016- 2017. 

But these metas are not usual, because the rest of the time these decks are great choices.  

I don't think I'm being hurtful to anything but players who don't consider bringing something spare when they have the option just in case.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> br reanimator also is good against the unprepared, which other people who have to proxy for an event will tend to be on average.

Bonus win% if you can play something that wins quickly   its unclear what to force to stop the combo.

Burn WILL pants people unfamiliar with the format. The first time they tap out thinking that they are safe because you only have 2 cards in hand, then you bolt, price of progress fireblast them out of the game, "Just the Burn deck" wont be a thing they will say for a while.

That goes for you too. 4 damage for free and 6-8 with 2 mana completely changes how many cards they need in hand to kill you.  1 mana, 1 card three damage is modern burn, modern fire philosophy. in legacy its more like 1.5 mana ,1 card, 4 damage. This makes it so that burn needs 5 cards or less to kill you rather than 7. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> sweet.

if i beat delver twice, top 8 , or just want you to play something awesome tommorrow, i'm sending you guys a donation as soon as you can tell me how.

Just signed up for twitch for you guys.

magic highlights: 
-Learn the dangers of the four-color manabase  

-See the advantages and disadvantages of the card delver of secrets

-See a comprehensive deconsruction of all in red and its place in the current legacy meta.

- first appearence of cephalid breakfast 2017

- bonus legacy cube draft, perfect showcase of the mono-green ramp archetype

non magic highlights
 - one of the hosts is psychologically tortured live by a ghost from his past. His mind breaks down to the point he doesn't even realize his tormentor has given him a way out until someone else explicitly confirms it.
It  mirrors something out of lovecraft, in structure if not severity. definitely worth a watch for this if nothing else.

criticisms are: fix mic sensitivity so you can be you without pissing off the part of your audience that wants a lttle less you, give plus 5 seconds for lag to catch up before making a difficult play(the audience can have trouble contacting you with info you havent yet considered. Lag.)

Maybe talk about a weird list once per stream.  Players love lists.

the thing you mostly nailed that most streamers get wrongish at first is finding the balance between playing at a reasonable pace and talking to your audience. Especially in a CoCast situation. Its hard and you guys made it look easy, flavor text of eternal warrior style.
Mad Props.

On visibility: I'm pretty sure that your reddit stream annoucement is mostly responsible for your viewer  count. Like, you click on the legacy reddit and the first thing you see is "hey guys, come watch us play legacy?' how do you not get viewers from that?    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> gilded drake is horible against tempo, this card is great against it, but only when you're trying to execute certain strategies. 

certain combo decks in particular may want this over drake.

on braid of fire, be careful to remember when you are testing that card to think about when carpet of flowers would have done a similar job in that slot if you changed your sequencing.

the cards are so close to each other given the way that enchantress plays out that you should probably make sure that braid is the correct meta call.

	<TEXT> You may not be able to run decay or push. 
as i said most of grixis delvers threats, most of BUGs threats depending, etc see opening post.

i agree with you against infect though, 1 target likely isn't enough.

This isn't supposed to stick around though. It's more of a mid-late tempo play where you take someting for two turns at most and try to end the game before the upkeep becomes untenable. 

the applications are fringe, but some decks want access to the type of cheap, temporary tempo swing that this card provides. 

you may be correct about the submerge point though, in that the tempo gained is less temporary but less severe. 

I guess we are comparing time ebb to doom blade to act of treason though, which kind of invalidates the comparison.

Different cards for different situations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just think these terms are worse than worthless really. Belcher for example would  only be a "meta deck" if you brought it and won, but if you got forced out of top 8 contention, you shouldn't have brought your "gimmick deck" to a real tournament.

Just irks me that this stuff only makes people look like a genius in hindsight, and then only when they don't get their skill downplayed  by people saying " yeah he had to get lucky to top8 with that garbage.

	<TEXT> There is no community consensus on that.

lands is a meta/gimmick deck, it has a hard time against combo. if your meta is combo, don't bring lands.

this statement is true, this statement is representative of the kind of statement that can be said of a lot of tier 1.5 + legacy decks, and this statement is awkward for the purpose of measuring how good a deck lands is.

The truth is, most non-blue (and some blue based) legacy decks are garbage in common but not usual metagame situations.

I saw an almost mono brown 12 post list that is around the price point of led dredge.

I actually am really far behind when i cast force of will, but once i do, the opponent has to think about  the card the rest of the match.

	<TEXT> Ended up not going to the Saturday one and 3-1 ing with tezzerator on Friday. Found 1 transmute under my couch last minute.

Lost to miracles 1-2, beat dredge 2-0, UB reanimator 2-1, and GU eldrazi stompy 2-0.

Stompy featured maindeck trinisphere and elder deep fiend. 

meta was very different from previous three weeks, multiple copies of UB reanimator, BR,reanimator, burn, dredge, and deadguy,  with much less miracles, stompy, death and taxes, and other chalice decks than usual.
filling out the meta with jund, lands,aggro loam, and 1 delver deck. 

The Breakfast deck is kinda bad against bug decks with push because of the sheer volume of interaction those decks have. Push + Decay + Thoughtseize + Deathrite + Force to start with, Golgari Charm +  Surgical in the board. 
I could beat some of this pre-push because Decay+ Deathrite + Force is too slow sometimes and not enough some of the other times, but push gives that deck 1 mana creature removal pre-board.

post- board transform is terrible in the face of golgari charm and increased -1-1 effects, to fight True-name out of bug.

It doesn't look like people have adapted to new printings yet though, Hmm.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah if you are new, you have no idea what you can and cant force. Furthermore, you don't have enough experience with the format to know what matchups are grindy, or what grindy decks have a combo finish.

For new players, Force is a safety net to cover all the other mistakes they make in deck choice, format knowledge, deckbuilding, mulligans, etc.

Before they even get to sideboarding they probably need force just to make up for being new.

	<TEXT> I've learned the hard way that cards of that kind of cost have to be creatures or else bad things happen.

Your bar is Sorin, Grim nemesis. Pass it, and this might be playable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really hard to have this conversation without knowing precisely how strongly you feel about certain decks and strategies.

It seems to me that you want a format with no non-blue strategies present? 

as in, right now, you have decks that are non-blue that pick up games against other non-blue decks,
but only exist really to target the blue decks of the format. This means that  the biggest threat to some of these decks is each other. (and consistency obv.) 

So as i understand it, You want to get these things out of the format entirely so that people will only play good decks(blue decks).

You acknowledge at the start of the article that people cannot switch decks that they are invested in,
so you acknowledge that the people affected by these changes will not be able to find even the success that they have, so they will have to either change decks or quit the format.

I guess I just dont know what you are trying to accomplish.         </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool, you believe that non-blue decks are this side of unplayable, so you want to ban all the cards that make it so that  non-blue decks even look playable to the subset of people that enjoy playing them.

Your goal is not to ban cards that hurt the format. I have no idea what your goal is, but the one you stated isn't it. The only positive thing that could come out of this is perhaps a more honest conversation on the prevalence of blue, but that you also said you don't care about blue(and by extention brainstorm)
being prevalent.

Honest question: what do you think happens to miracles' percentage of the meta after your proposed changes?

follow up/ related question: What cards/strategies do you think would be effective against miracles following said changes. 

The reason i ask these things is because I don't think you can make such changes without having some idea of what the format will look like after the fact.
