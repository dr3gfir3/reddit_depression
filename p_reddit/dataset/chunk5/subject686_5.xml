	<TITLE> Starting making gold with Alchemy. Today. Worth it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-02 17:59:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Meaning that I wasnt playing wow when the legion gold train started at launch, when everyone could make profits with mats. I haven't really made any money since cata, back then I was farming a lot and selling potions. But I wanted to make some gold with alchemy again, but I just started. 
The problem is, I'm sitting on around 40k, don't have a lot of time to farm mats, and the mats for flasks are a lot more expensive than the cost of actual flask. So basically my only way of trying to get to rank 3 is to buy mats and sell flasks, while losing money. Hoping i dont lose everything before i get to rank 3. 
Is what im doing worth it at all? I'm basically crossing fingers to get lucky on the rank 3 recipe.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got back to wow a month ago, very casually playing since TBC (my job schedule sucks ballz, kid on the way, etc.) and I've been mostly playing a mage.
 I do however have a shammy on lv 35 that I would like to make it a 110 as a ench. 
But I've been so out of the loop that I'm having trouble figuring out which heirlooms should i be looking at. I found mostly old articles on the topic online, so no much luck on figuring this out on my own... if anyone has any 2 cents to add, please do!

Thank you all 3 </TEXT>
