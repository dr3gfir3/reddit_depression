	<TEXT> Masala - 
In a pan, heat up little oil, saut some garlic ginger paste. 
Then add turmeric and Kashmiri red chilli powder. 

All this is to be done in low heat so you don't burn the spices.

Let it cool and then add that to the yogurt. I use Turkish 10%.

Marinate your chicken pieces for 3 -4 hrs and cook.
Preheated over at 250c for 25-30 minutes does the job. </TEXT>
