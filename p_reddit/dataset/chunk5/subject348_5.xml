	<TEXT> Admittedly when i first listened to the song, it felt really messy and bit overwhelming. But after hearing it a few times and after that initial shock it's grown on me so much, definitely one of the top 3 songs from an already fantastic and crazy album </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i think he has a fantastic ground game, and props to him for making it that dangerous that maynard wouldn't want to toy with it. but no way was he owning him on the feet. he was landing at range kicks (with success, yes) but he was dropping literally every time a strike would come his way. please explain how that is 'owning someone' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> do you think maynard could have landed any more strikes if Hall's gameplan wasn't to drop to the floor every time he got close? or do you think that's a valid game plan? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> dont you think Hall should have worked harder for the takedown then and forced maynard onto the ground? surely he was making the fight go slow by not working for the takedown </TEXT>

	<TEXT> he landed nice kicks, but would you really consider the guy who would flop the moment he thinks he might get hit the better striker? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno, it's pretty hard to get behind a dude whose main technique is to flop to the ground every time he thought he might get hit. 

He had very quick kicks and landed a good couple of hook kicks, and I mean, sure props to him for having trained so hard and making his ground gamer that scary, but as a fighter, that was ridiculous.
Every time his opponent came into any range where he couldn't throw his distance kicks he would flop. no technique involved, just outright flopped. Who does that, and would that not be considered aggressively disengaging? it was terrible man and then to complain that maynard wouldn't engage when that was exactly what he was doing. 

(sure maynard should have engaged in his ground game you could argue, but at the same time i definitely think the onus should be on the ground specialist to get it to the floor, flopping down at the first sign of trouble can't really be considered a position you've 'earned')  </TEXT>

I don't know how I feel about that. I'm sort of excited, but I wonder.if It's a one time thing or he'll start fighting again.
