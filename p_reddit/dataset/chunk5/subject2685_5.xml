I have a JSON file that is several GB large.  
 Looks like [this](http://pastebin.com/LFeZp3T2)

I'm sort of confused by looking at the JSON.parse methods.  Can anyone show me some example code on how I can make it look for instances where "type" = "quote" and then give me the "slug" of that instance?  I used Hashie before, which worked for a bit on very small files, but it failed at larger files. </TEXT>

Basically that is the simplest level of activity. As a whole structure, there are millions of these, which it interprets as a pattern we call binary aka 10101011101 etc. We make codes for many combinations.  </TEXT>

    CODE

    Rescue

    "next?"

    End


Would the "next" command work here, or is that only for loops? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By far the best answer. Thank you so much for letting me know of some ways it can be done. Usually nervous to post questions like these because so often are they downvoted or simply answered "if you're asking this you're doing it all wrong." It was great getting support.  I will definitely be tracking down both Adler and Forsyth's orchestration book for sure! Thanks again!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey this is really great advice. I'll take solid note of this. (Oh and before I forget, I have been looking into mechanical licenses).  So i'm guessing it would be slightly less of a translation and more of adding music into it, for new instruments, right? Is there no instrument in the orchestra that plays the entire piece fully, while the rest play parts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys/gals,
I'm new to composing but I always wanted to start making pieces. I've been trying to make an orchestral version of Soko's "For Marlon". Figured it'd be good cause it feels sort of simplistic yet has a ton of notes. **I have them all transcribed into piano notes, and I am curious how I would break it into a mini orchestra.** Should I just split all the notes above middle C to be played by violin and all the notes below by cello or would that sound rubbish? Or should I do that and make a third simultaneous track with a piano that plays the whole score? I understand the best way is to try it out, but it takes a TON of time and looking for some advice on the way forward. Anyone have some experience with this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone,

I'm like to transcribe guitar music tabs to piano keys or MIDI.  I use [this guitar chart picture](http://i.imgur.com/XzWZwuK.png) typically; however I'm not sure what happens to all these notes when a CAPO is put on fret seven.  I edited the picture by highlighting what middle C SOUNDS like on a guitar (I believe actual middle C sounds one octave lower on the guitar).  Figured the best place to ask this is here.

**Any help is greatly appreciated!** </TEXT>

Then there is another one where he is praying to basically every God he can, give me a sec, i'll look for it.  EDIT: here it is: http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/for-jane-with-all-the-love-i-had-which-was-not-e/

He also talking about praying in " The Spider" (here :http://bybukowski.tumblr.com/page/3) when he is pretty sick.

Here is a quote by him on God where he believes he is God: http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13733-for-those-who-believe-in-god-most-of-the-big </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Ruby] How to create object or objects for JSON data? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **I'm going to start off by apologizing in advance if this is asking too much, but I am trying to learn.**


The project I have been working on is a data sorter, using social media. I figure this is a good stepping stone that I can build off of later to make bots.


So I used the tumblr API and got some data *(I replaced it all with fictional info here for posting purposes. I know it's all public, but even then I don't like to share info.)* It's a JSON, and here is a fragment of it: http://pastebin.com/TrwCLnBZ


The question is, how do I turn it into an object that is easier to use, so I can call on it and ask for certain criteria, like blog names that have the "type" that is "quote"? There are a ton of these, as you can see, and the pastebin only includes two.


Again, I am really, REALLY appreciated for any help or advice anyone can give to me on this. Posted this as well on /r/Ruby, but thought I should also post here. Thank you! xo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey ausphex,

Interesting anecdote, I looked into it.  Didn't find anything relating to "Senile-ty" (maybe the search term through google off) but did find that it was Archimedes.  From what I gathered, it was when he discovered the physics idea of "displacement" when he was in a bathtub.  When he realized it, he ran out of the bathtub, and without putting his clothes on he ran through the streets yelling "Eureka."  Try searching "Eureka Archimedes."  Perhaps problems with becoming senile beforehand made it an even bigger deal.

here are two quick (but **not the best** sources):

	<TEXT> Been trying to practice my australian accent.  When reading accent prompts it's easy, but when I finally turned to an ordinary poem, I failed horrendously.  Can someone read this in an australian accent to know how it's done?

    "Theres nothing to mourn about death any more than there is to mourn about the growing of a flower. What is terrible is not death but the lives people live or dont live up until their death. They dont honor their own lives, they piss on their lives. They shit them away. Dumb fuckers. They concentrate too much on fucking, movies, money, family, fucking. Their minds are full of cotton. They swallow God without thinking, they swallow country without thinking. Soon they forget how to think, they let others think for them. Their brains are stuffed with cotton. They look ugly, they talk ugly, they walk ugly. Play them the great music of the centuries and they cant hear it. Most peoples deaths are a sham. Theres nothing left to die."
