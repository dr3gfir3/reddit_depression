	<TEXT> I think a big part of how people handle aging has to do with their *true* feelings on religion.  

Those that are honestly 100% believers in an afterlife I think can have a reasonable approach to death however it can affect their outlook on life negatively.  With eternity awaiting you, the need to truly enjoy each and every day is not as important.

Atheists (of which I am one) have a very healthy positive outlook on life and death.  I know I will die and I know that it could be any day from now until a few decades from now.  But it is coming.  And since I don't believe in an afterlife I spend every single day enjoying the day - knowing that I only have a limited number to enjoy.

The people that I think have it the worst are the people that outwardly say they are religious and believe in an afterlife but secret harbor doubts.  It must be scary to live everyday not knowing if you have eternity waiting for you or dust. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's an interesting perspective.

While I do not know the man (never met or seen him in person) two of my partners know him personally (and are in his "economic strata") and they basically say he's nothing but a cheap con-man.  Take that for what it's worth as it is second-hand.

Another one I don't understand is W Bush.  I have always felt he came off as a bumbling idiot (think Gerald Ford / Chevy Chase) but people that have spent a lot of time with him tell me he is one of the smartest people they have ever met.  Go figure.

Thanks for responding. </TEXT>

Could you elaborate?  When I watch the two speak I just don't see any speaking skills nor gravitas with Trump while Obama has always just been able to make me "lean in" - he seems intelligent and earnest.

Honestly curious for your perspective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome!  I have some amazing memories of that computer.

Short story time: When I was a teenager I had a passbook savings account (most kids did at the time).  You would go make a deposit and the bank would stamp a little book that looked like a passport.

I was a big science nerd and saw the ad for the sinclair in probably Popular Science.  Without telling my parents I withdrew all of my money (mostly birthday and christmas deposits) and bought the sinclair.

When it arrived my parents were furious and sent me to my room.  They only made one mistake.  They left the boxes in my room. :)

Nearly 40 years later I have built and sold 2 software companies and am currently on my third.

Best grounding ever.  Little did my parents know that one random punishment would make their lives much easier in retirement.  :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Umm... yep.  I always said that.  Always supported the President that America supported even if I didn't vote for them.

Funny thing though. Somewhere about the time that a congressman decided to yell "YOU LIE!" to the sitting President during the State of the Union address I realized something had changed in my country.

Instead of people eating crow quietly and outwardly providing at least an image of civility and support we had decided to roll around in the mud.

For eight years we have watched a Republican party intent on making their dislike for the sitting President abundantly clear via personal and baseless attacks.

Now you ask us suddenly when they are in power to just act like we did act as a country for decades before their little tirade?

I was not a Hillary fan but I voted for her as my only viable choice to prevent this misogynistic, racist, serial-liar from become President.  I failed.  

And while I will not complain further about the new President I most certainly will not support him.

Bill Clinton denigrated the office of the President.
Republicans furthered the process of devaluing bipartisan support of the sitting President.

Now all that is left is to keep quiet, make some popcorn, and watch this disaster unfold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me: 52M - 5'7" 180 Caucasian

I have had 3 cervical fusions and am now fused C2-T1. One surgery resulted in a MRSA infection (fun!). Last surgery was 2 years ago.

Six months ago I started noticing random twitches in my right arm and leg. I also noticed a tremor in my hand (isolated to the fingers - ring finger being the most active).

My hand has started "clenching"/cramping into weird painful positions every few days.

The leg and arm spasms have increased in frequency and strength. They generally happen when I am in a relaxed state (sitting/laying down) but can happen when standing if I am not resting weight on the right leg. I can stare at the extremity and concentrate and the spasm will generally stop until I start focusing on something else.

The spasms are also initiated by a loud sound, bright light, or rapid movement that my eyes detect.

I have just visited a neurologist and am being scheduled for a brain scan. I'm a little freaked out because she said my symptoms didn't fit the normal things she sees.

Am I worrying for nothing or does this sound familiar?

Thanks in advance for any ideas you might have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You asked a question and then you try with every response to tell the commenter why they are wrong.

You asked why people are full of doom and gloom and they are answering you.

Based on what Trump has said himself - the positions he has said he supports - we as a country can expect a variety of changes under his presidency that many find un-American and harmful to the country.  You might not agree but that fear is why people are all doomy and gloomy.

- Unwinding climate change initiatives
- Reverting to fossil fuels and defocusing from renewables
- Woman's rights, especially as it pertains to abortions
- LBGT rights 
- Withdrawal from free trade agreements

There are more but these the ones most frequently sited.  And note many of these will happen simply because Trump will fill the SCOTUS vacancy with a hard right conservative ensuring that the court stays right leaning.

Out of all the doom and gloom my biggest fear now is that one of the remaining liberal justices passes away in the next four years and my children are stuck with a hard right SCOTUS for the next few decades. </TEXT>

A tech founder should never turn their company over to an outsider.  If a capital partner is pushing that then run the other way.  You want a partner that believes in the business you have built and respects your abilities enough to help mentor your growth as a CEO.

In my case however, I never wanted to be a CEO.  But when you found a company it becomes very hard to step back into the tech role that you really want to be in.

My first company, I held the company back because I wasn't an experienced enough business man.  We still did well and sold on the other side of the dotcom implosion when many didn't make it that far.

The next one I founded I said right up front "I don't want to be the CEO.  About a year in we did a search and hired an outside CEO.  It was a disaster.  It was my money but I didn't really try to keep an eye on things.  I just wanted to develop great software.  He was forced out after spending a shit-ton of my money and putting the company in a deep debt hole (including not paying IRS withholdings - that I as primary owner was on the hook for).  I like to say the day he left is the day I became a good CEO.  We built that company, learned a lot, and finally sold it to a public company.

Now on my third, I have sadly gotten so far from the technology and it moves so fast that I can't even think of going back to what I love.  BUT, I have laid out my path to get out of the CEO position.  The board just let me promote the President to Co-CEO and with in a year or so I am hoping to step back and down into doing the fun stuff again - designing software even if I can't code it anymore.  :)

In my case   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was looking to rent a trailer to help with overflow sleeping for Thanksgiving this year.  

I use VRBO a lot for rental homes and figured something like that had to exist for trailers.  A quick google search found RVShare.  Had looked a bit further down the search page I would have seen the "F" rating from the BBB - alas I didn't.

So I put in my trailer search criteria in and find two trailers that look like good fits.  I fill out the rental request form and send emails to them asking about availability.  One nice lady (Cindy) replied and we exchanged a series of email and everything lined up great.

So then I get an email from Cindy with a contract and an invoice for the rental - so I pay it through the website.  Then the fun starts.

I start getting weird emails that don't make sense.  Questions I have already answered.  An insurance rider pulling the trailer (I'm having it delivered and not moving it).

After much confusion I realize there TWO different people (both named Cindy) talking to me.  It turns out that RVShare takes your search request and somehow makes it available to its other "renters".  So out of the blue this "second" Cindy just injected herself and sent me a contract - which I paid for.

The trailer I rented is fine - I'm not picky - but it was very confusing, felt like I was being scammed, and ultimately - while trying to figure out what the hell was going on THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTACT RVSHARE other than email - which they haven't responded to.

So unless you are interested in a frustrating, confusing rental with a ting of "what the hell?  you shared my rental request with other people?!?" with a vendor that has provides 0% customer support I would suggest you avoid RVShare.com </TEXT>

It isn't working (partially) because Republican governors are undermining it.

Sure Single-Payer Healthcare is a possible solution as is reworking the existing law in a bipartisan way to fix the deficiencies.

But keep believing what you want.  One of these days the 10% on the far fringes of both parties will be ignored and the center 80% will govern across the aisles.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all it clearly states that this is not a Marketplace plan and you will get no help with the premium but if you go to the healthcare.gov and enroll in a plan that is covered under the federal marketplace you might have a better outcome.

Healthcare isn't free.  It isn't for working people that get insurance through employers.  It surely isn't through ACA.  But it can and is affordable for those that can't afford it.  BTW - total premiums through an employer cost around $2,000 a month (or more) but the employer covers the majority of that for the employee (I know I'm an employer).

Oh wait - I see you are in GA.  With a Republican governor who refuses to accept the Medicaid federal funds that would help lower the premium for those that don't make enough.

	<TEXT> I would suggest just changing the cabinet doors.  It's a lot cheaper and the results can be amazing.

We had an old house that had simple plywood cabinet doors.  We removed the doors, sanded the cabinets and used a blue paint/stain on them.  

Then we measured and ordered the custom wood cabinet doors from Home Depot.  Totally transformed the kitchen on the cheap.

My only additional advice is if I had to do it again I wouldn't use Home Depot.  While it was convenient and easy it was more expensive than if you just do a little internet research these days and order them direct.

Edit: went back and looked at your picture.  One other thing we did that you might want to consider is swapping out the counter top with something more durable like Corian.  It will probably cost you a couple thousand but for all in of about $2,500 you can have a sweet kitchen. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-10-14 20:43:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I posted the other day asking for opinions on Hughsnet to get out of my Windstream hell.  Y'all quickly talked me out of that so here's my new stupid question - could I realistically just use my Verizon phone(s) as hotspots?

There are three people in the household.  My wife and I work from home and are on all day - she is low bandwidth writing code.  I'm on voice Skype calls most of the day.  We have a 12yo that games on his desktop (mostly Ark Survival right now).  We generally only watch one hour of TV per day - Netflix or Amazon.

I called Windstream to find out what our historical monthly usage is but they say they don't track it (cough*bullshit*cough).

Looks like I could get a Verizon plan with 70G a month or so.  Realistically what would the above scenario be pulling a month best guess?

Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a writer but I'll give it a shot:

The morning was still but the children awoke restless.  "Can we please go outside today? Please daddy!"  Three little faces, young and excited to see the world and all of its wonders.

"Kids, I wish you could go out and play like you used to but for the time being that's not really something we can do" I replied, with my most knowing fatherly grin.  "Soon" I confidently added knowing in my heart how much I hate lying to them.

It's been a long four years since "The Revolution" that swept President Trump into power.  Amazing in hindsight that none of us saw it coming.  Of course until it was too late.  We're a republic.  The greatest of the great.  The world's only true super power. Surely the checks and balances of our great constitution will ensure that no one man can destroy what our fore fathers built. 

But Trump tapped into something inside of us that most didn't even know was there.  A primal hatred.  A pent-up anger against anything and everything "different".  We watched the world shift, evolve, and grow for 50 plus years.  Never once did we see that our old prejudices weren't fading away.  They were just moving deeper into our core - away from view.  Away from any ability to understand and address the root of those frustrations.  Until it was too late.

Trump swept into power on what initially felt like a minority point of view.  But once in office the depth of our country's hatred rapidly boiled to the surface.  

At first the changes seemed ugly but manageable - a banning of Muslims from entering our country, a growing Police State to "secure and protect" us all from the ongoing random acts of terror that were plaguing the country.  

Oh, and the wall.  Don't get me started on the wall.  What was the final bill, $4 trillion?  And by god, he sure did get Mexico to pay for it.  Amazing what fear does to people.  Trump was right in the end.  With unhinged threats and a finger on the nuclear "option" people tend to fall in line.

My daughter's nuzzling under my chin brings me back to the present.  Her eyes pleading with me once more - "Please Daddy??  We just want to go outside and play!"

But this day would be just like so many before.  All of us stuck here in this small hidden room.  Quiet.  Waiting.  Worrying if - when - we may be found out.  Hiding in our own country for fear that our "differences" were just too much for a citizenry bent on ensuring conformity to "their norm". </TEXT>

The congress was presented a very biased view of the intel that was provided.  Just like Colin Powell sitting in front of NATO.  

The intel was manipulated to support the story that the Bush administration wanted told. </TEXT>

Sure the Democrats supported the war but only in the context that they were told point blank that there were WMDs and Iraq was a threat - when in reality that was nothing but nation-building rhetoric. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks.  Today was the first time a contractor for Windstream came as opposed to an actual Windstream employee.

He fixed the problem (so far) and told my wife the problem was that they (Windstream) miscalculated the distance to the substation.  They just went from the substation our address at the road.  But our house is set pretty far back in and they didn't include that distance in their calculation and something about wrong pins or something.  All foreign to me but we'll see how it holds this time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks.  I have Verizon and do connect as a personal hotspot when Windstream craps out.

It is slow but at least keeps us working partially.  Since they are business accounts any data overage is covered by my employer.

I just really, really want the 21st century to arrive faster.  I need reliable broadband and it seems silly in today's day and age, in the U.S. no less, that we can't have open markets so that there is *some* competition to at least keep these providers honest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the info and perspective.

No, we are very limited in availability here.  Windstream is effectively the only "hard-wired" solution available.

Which I guess speaks to why their service can be so terrible but customers don't leave.

I would give my left nut to have some form of reliable over-the-air broadband but it doesn't sound like Hughesnet is necessarily the answer.  :( </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi.  We live in rural GA and are currently using Windstream which is a nightmare.  It goes out frequently and takes days for a service call.

I am considering changing over to a satellite provider and Hughesnet seems to be the most prominent one.

We cut the cord over a year ago and love it other than the interruptions in Internet service that basically take us off the grid.  Both my wife and I work from home so we need consistent access.  We don't really watch much TV - a little Netflix and Amazon but that's about it.  

Has anyone used Hughesnet?  How consistent is the service?  What do the average speeds look like?  The highest plan says "up to" 10MB.  Windstream currently charges us for "up to 25MB" - they should just go for broke and say "up to 100MB" because they never are faster than 15MB when I speed test the connection.

Thanks for any answers in advance </TEXT>

 When you are young and engaged in your career it can be fun living in the city. Obviously there is a lot of culture and nightlife which is exciting when you're in your 20s maybe early 30s. However once you have a family and are far enough in your life that you want to get away from those things living in the country provide you the ability to not have to deal with the people that you cant stand that you used to live with in the city.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One year for Guys-Weekend-Out we went to Mazatlan.

We were looking for something fun to do and this local told us he could take us to an island with a bar and lots of cool things to do.  Sounded like a good time, so we went down to the marina and loaded up on a little boat and went to the island.

A good time was had by all until we were a bit drunk and ready to go back to the mainland and couldn't find the guy with the boat that brought us there.

That's when someone saw a taxi pull up and asked a guy that worked at the bar "how big is this island that you have taxis?"  The bartender said "oh this isn't an island.... more of a ... penisula."

We basically took a boat ride down the beach. </TEXT>

We have Netflix and Amazon and have more than we could ever watch.

I'm still adjusting to not having access to news or sports on the TV but honestly - it's the 21st century.  I don't read newspapers any more either so what's the big deal if I get my news from my iPad really?

And never was a big sports fan so not missing that much that matters to me there.

	<TEXT> While it would be helpful to see the entire dashcam the published still is pretty clear that he is standing in a threatening position indicating he has a gun.  

Based on what we have seen so far it appears justified but as you say we should see the full video.

Funny how protestors don't really care any more about what really happened.  If police shoot someone they just start protesting regardless of the situation.

We should all learn to take a deep breath, wait for full information to be disclosed, and if it isn't - peacefully protest until it is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted this before on an AskReddit but seemed appropriate to repost again here:

This was toward the end of the year 2000. I was the CEO of a company I had founded in the software industry.

At this time I had never raised capital before. I had received lots of "scam" emails before and they were very easy to spot and ignore. But around this time I received an email from a representative of a supposed "Arab prince" wanting to invest in our company. I ignored it. The guy was persistent and even called my office from London. It just didn't smell right but I was pretty naive. I listened to the man's pitch - he represented an Arab prince that was looking to invest in tech companies - minority investments, no active involvement, yada, yada.

It all sounded too good to be true. So after our call I didn't do anything. The guy persisted. He gave me the name of the Prince (I don't recall it exactly but it had "bin Aziz" in it. I honestly figured it was one of my buddies pulling a prank on me. Finally, it got the best of me. Luckily one of my wife's brothers works for The Company (if you know what I mean). I called him and asked him if he could look into the guy for me and see if it was legit. I sent him the email trails, phone number, names, etc. A day or two later he called me back and said that - yep, this guy was real. He just cautioned me to be careful but said it was at least not a scam. Now I was really kind of freaked out.

I talked with the guy further and we agreed that this prince would invest $3m into my company for a minority stake. Paperwork was drafted up. I was using a very prominent law firm. Everything seemed to be on the up and up.

When the time came to fund, he told me that the prince was going to be in London and if I was willing to fly over it would be a great gesture and I could meet him and sign the papers live. Shit! I had never really been out of the country (Canada and Mexico excepted). I went to my father-in-law who spent many years in Saudi and was fluent with their language and customs. He gave me lots of tips on does and don'ts.

So the time comes and I fly to London. The guy comes to meet me at my hotel to pick me up. He is carrying a large aluminum suitcase like you see in the movies. He informs me that the prince's jet has had an issue and he is not going to be able to meet with me. He asks if I have a private place we can go to execute the agreement. Now this is freaky at this point and just SO OUT of what my life had ever been to this point. I tell him that we can go up to my suite and we do. Once there, he produces multiple copies of the agreement to be signed. As I am starting to review the agreements he opens the suitcase and it is filled with stacks of $100 bills! I almost freaked out. I said "what the hell is that?" He said "this is the prince's $3m investment. I also have an additional suitcase down in my car that the prince asked me to give to you after we have closed the deal that contains another $3m that is personally for you in hopes that you will watch over the prince's investment closely." Of course my first response was "are you crazy??! I can't take CASH. I can't carry money like that back to the US?" He argued with me a bit (in a very nice, low tone) but I just had to say NO WAY and I was really scared by now that something really bad was going to happen. After some tense discussion with me making it clear that I would NOT take cash he left with the suitcase a bit angry.

I returned to the US mostly in shock I guess. When I got back I called my brother-in-law to tell him what happened. He said he wanted to check with some colleagues and call me back. When he did he said I could have very legally taken that cash. And declared it and although there would have been questions I would have probably been fine. He also said I could have opened an account in London (although I don't see how you do that with that much CASH and not raise an eyebrow or two). But then he said, I am glad you didn't. Because what would have happened next is that a few months down the road, you would have heard from the guy again and he would inform you that the prince wanted to invest more. And it would have kept coming until one day a federal marshal would have shown up on your door.

Turns out this is one of the ways (back then - can't speak for now) illicit oil money was getting laundered. The Arabs sell oil outside of OPEC in all cash deals (mostly with China) and then try to buy stakes in small legitimate businesses with rubes like me that will fall for it (that's what the extra $3m was for - to make me say HELL YEAH).

So like I said, not exactly a "scam" but something strange and with scam like feel to it. Good news is we didn't get taken and eventually sold the company in 2001.

TL;DR A real Saudi prince tried to "invest" $3m in cash in my company if I would only carry it back to the US for him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm building a "hobbit house".  The excavation is complete and since the house is round I decided that I will pour the walls in separate 4' sections with rebar exposed to tie the sections together.

In the past I have had issues with plywood forms (greased/oiled on the concrete side) being hard to remove if I wait too long after the pour.

I'm planning to use DOT5k mix with fiber which dries really fast.
