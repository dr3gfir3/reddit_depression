	<TEXT> Swap is generally the practice of swapping out less used memory from RAM to a slower storage medium like a disc, to make room for new data. (I.e. a fallback for RAM so your computer doesn't crash, but merely slows down.)

There may be files on disk that are used as swap, but I don't think there are entire disks dedicated to swap. That would be madness. </TEXT>

 How many times, when the Fighter says "I draw my sword", did you just want to smack that cheating-optimizer in the face and say "No! You don't draw your sword! You draw Orcus!". When the Cleric says "I run away from Orcus!": "No! You run into Orcus! Rogue tries to hide? He hides behind Orcus! The bard in a tavern on the other side the town tries to order a drink? How about a nice frothy mug of Orcus?

	<TEXT> His being that difficult removes some of the sympathy I have for him, but nevertheless, I do sympathize. It might even be a defense mechanism in the face of what he feels are overwhelming odds.

This is simply the kind of player he is. He has a favourite role he wants to play. I cannot emphasize enough that this is **no less a valid playstyle than any other**. 3.5 DMG2 offers some great insights on player types if you wanna dig deeper.

 I cant see how it would be "too much work" to create a new character in an evening while I am sacrificing months to create a fun world to explore.

This shows that you completely misunderstand where his enjoyment of the game comes from.
***
Engage him based on his backstory(though I would seriously ask him for a 2-page summary of the key points). If you're running a particularly lethal game you should have mentioned this before starting it. You both could compromise, by you having ways for him to keep playing his character if he dies(resurrections, deific patron, etc.).

If you are not willing to accommodate his playstyle, do notify him bluntly, let him play till he dies and send him off with a memorable scene when it does happen. At this point it just becomes a situation of 2 conflicting parties, neither of which are willing to compromise so it's best to part ways. </TEXT>

Point is, equating reality to a game does the game a disservice 99.9% of the time. Consistency is a nobler goal the same amount of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Come on... CR was never meant to be indicative of threat. It is just a rough metric that will help you gauge the power level of a monster.

A CR5 monster can TPK a L7 party, if it exploits their weaknesses, and similarly a L5 party can completely walk over a CR10 monster they were particularly strong against.

Besides, you have to realize that in the current "meta" of 3.5 CR means even less.

And not because of the example you mentioned mind you. An optimized barbarian can probably one-shot your young dragon.

No, the problem is the action economy. At higher levels the action economy advantage of a party against a SINGLE monster becomes so great, that anything that's not untouchable(and thus TPK material) gets completely obliterated.

Use more than single creatures. For BBEGs have setpiece battles. Changing terrain, reinforcements, time limits, etc. </TEXT>

The thing I personally like with 3.P is the consistency it can bring. There's enough material, that I as a DM can reasonably extrapolate any situation, even if not directly covered by any rule(which is rare enough as it is).  
That means that PCs, given enough system mastery can make concrete predictions on how the world will respond to their actions. None of that "what do I feel the DC here is" or "hm, this task should be hard enough

You wanna slit someone's throat? PF's Called Shots.  
You wanna make a Faustian deal? Fiendish Codex II.  
How do you handle possession by a demon? Book of Vile Darkness.  
Keep your undead straight? Libris Mortis.  
Rule a kingdom? PF's Ultimate Campaign.  
Wage naval warfare? Stormwrack.  
Do gladiator combat? PF's Ultimate Combat.

That, and the amount of character options. Play anything from a bard dragon to intelligent undead to a mermaid barbarian. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for indulging me.

Eberron is really that steampunk world you're talking about. It's actually a pretty cool setting. Rokugan was the eastern spinoff(i.e. L5R). And I think Kingdoms of Kalamar came in 3.5 era.  
I think all the rest were from before(i.e. Dark Sun, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Ravenloft, etc.).  
I guess Ghostwalk can sorta kinda count as a setting, even if it's just one book. It's basically just the city of Manifest and environs, along with changes to make dead people playable.

Out of all of those I probably like the Planescape setting best.

But you are correct, you can't just wipe 20 years of content. And only for AD D. Compared to that, I'd still count as a relative newbie I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well then, your experience has been vastly different than mine. Not sure what level of power you were playing, but in high-op games, where my time was spent, the monster vs player equation is pretty evenly split between attack/ability DC vs AC/saves. SR also plays a regular role in that interaction, just a bit less frequently.

Also, attack bonuses vastly outpace AC growth. A well built damage dealer will always hit.

Not to mention DR, energy resistance, concealment/miss chances, immunities, contingencies or my favourite: no save, just suck.

There are so bloody many attack and defense vectors you can take, it's almost impossible to break the system by going out of range.

What you're talking about is telling me that you and your DMs never really left that cozy core-only(or close enough) sandbox. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was for a one shot, so it didn't affect much of anything besides frustrating me, since I knew I was right. The DM was also a rules-lawyer-y type of the so I thought we would mesh well. The truth turned out the exact opposite. He did concede my point a week later in that, so that counts a moral victory, I guess.

That was years ago, before I had learned to let go of things like that. I still remember it, because it was the first major argument I ever had at the table and forced me to think about just how unproductive they were. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's more or less a deity.

Now ask yourself, what do you think mortal magic can hope to achieve against deities?

If the DM so much as lets you touch him without going into high mythic/epics, he's doing something horribly, horribly wrong.

You need a reality check. If the Lord of the Damned freakin hells had to worry about even a single evil sorceror, he would have been taken down literally ages ago.  
It's equivalent to saying "Oh, hey, I'll just train really hard for a month or two and go win a gold medal at the olympics."  
It is the Dunning-Kruger effect.

Okay, sure, he can let you go through with this and even successfully, but that destroys any amount of verisimilitude the campaign may have possessed up to that point. And most probably paints your him as an irredeemably lousy and boring DM. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. If that's what they focus on, more power to em.
2. It is part of the game. I see no reason to restrict it. Not artificially anyway.
3. Every crafting feat affords the PC to exceed his allotted wealth by 20%. Just read [here](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items#TOC-Adjusting-Character-Wealth-by-Level).
4. Crafting is a valid approach to playing the game. Taking that away from your players is silly to the highest degree. Of course, you can't let it get out of hand either, but in a vibrant, well constructed world the PCs usually have better or more pressing things to do than eternally crafting trinkets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boy, do they!

When has your game ever gone the way *YOU* planned it? If that doesn't count as changing requirements, I don't know what does.

It's kind of amusing actually. Cuz every time the party majorly deviates from what I think they'll do, it results in another branch in git. Then you can go in and see what branches you have and you get a history of the campaign, complete with all the roads not taken. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is pretty core to D D.

There are other options however. I've played Cypher, where things are handled in more granular steps. As in, no discrete levels, just abilities you buy with XP. I've also played Arcanum and Deus Ex, where the idea is somewhat similar. Both work pretty well.

There's also PF's [Staggered Advancement](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes#TOC-Staggered-Advancement) rules. They mimic the Cypher thing somewhat lousily, but can easily be adapted to do so better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the beauty of a rules heavy system like 3.5/PF: I can immediately give you a consistent answer:  
The AC is touch AC, the result is an automatic sneak attack(if rogue) + Critical [called shot](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/called-shots) to the neck, most likely a debilitating blow, even with a tough foe.  
If it doesn't kill him, it most certainly leaves him close to and rapidly bleeding out to take him the rest of the way to a bloody death.  
Perhaps the guy gets one chance at a grapple check to wriggle free. </TEXT>

Draconomicon if you really wanna emphasize the Dragons part of D D.

 5.5 Enjoy the moment of realization when your party explores that area.  
 5.6 Potentially have one of the NPCs around there be named Ripley.

As far as non-creature challenges:

Doors that cast spells. Things like gaseous form or baleful polymorph or gate or wail of the banshee.  
Areas with impeded, wild or enhanced magic.  
Self-contained planar slices.  
Unconnected rooms. Even a maze of such. Have fun with effects that divert, stop or delay teleports.  
Go non-magical. Give the skill monkeys opportunities to shine. There are tons of reasons a highly magical laboratory would want places where magic absolutely doesn't work.  
Any combination thereof. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my setting they're relatively common, as far as great big beasts go, but they also do a lot to stay out of the lesser race's way.  
They practically have a shadow society of their own.

The whole spreading "terror" shtick doesn't really happen with me. At least not in as overt a way as the stereotype suggest. They'd much rather rule over their lessers, according to each dragon's disposition(which might include terror, less often overt and more often through authority) or complete amongst themselves, for example in Xorvintaal.  
In any case there's a good chance the most powerful individual in a given area is a dragon, appearance notwithstanding. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have about 30K words worth of homebrew, so I fear I may be falling into that trap.  
It's worked so far, mostly because it touches on many topics, and only a small subset of it is ever relevant to a particular character or situation.  
But it's definitely becoming almost like a new handbook.

The other is... well, I'd like to say obvious, but it's painful how many get it wrong. For players to have fun, they need to have agency in your world. For them to have agency, they need to be able to effectively reason and make predictions about the events in your world. Which can't happen without consistency, which is very hard to achieve if you constantly improvise. </TEXT>

I get that it's simpler, but it has reduced the range of play so much, it's hard when the dice get in the way of the heroics.

I like that idea of low-level adventurers as bumbling fools who rely on luck growing into true mythical heroes who can reliably pull of superhuman feats(when you stack enough modifiers that the dice roll/luck doesn't matter anymore). </TEXT>
