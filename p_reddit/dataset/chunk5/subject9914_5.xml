	<TITLE> Cyclone Anti-Air Redesign </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-12 20:46:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The current cyclone is in an awkward position right now, possessing a decent anti-armor ground attack but a laughably weak anti-air attack, possible the weakest anti-air in the game. However, straight buffing the AA would make the cyclone too well-rounded off the bat. To make the unit more mechanically and aesthetically unified, I suggest the following:

1.  Make Lock-on use the same weapon as the ground attack, just shoot up. This would be more aesthetically consistent with the concept of the cyclone (think WWII-era AA flak cannons).  
2.  Cyclone can move while locked-on, but movement speed is reduced. This is to prevent the cyclone from being overly powerful against air offensively, while keeping it strong defensively.    
3.  Lock-on requires a research upgrade called "Advanced Targeting."  The tier that unlocks this upgrade can be arbitrarily adjusted to balance.  

This way, cyclone starts off as a limited ground attack unit, but can be upgraded to have decent AA.  I also personally think cyclone shouldn't be an anti-armor specialist, but should do the same damage across the board (something like 4 dmg).

"This was an honest mistake," said IBT editor-in-chief Dayan Candappa in an email at 10 p.m. Friday. "The corrected version should have included a note about the error, in line with our policy. Unfortunately, it did not, but we have now rectified that too."" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I acknowledge that many media outlets have a strong liberal bias in their reporting, they are a far cry from outright "fake" news.  Fake news refers to fabrications and hoaxes created solely to deceive readers. These are completely made-up stories with no grounding in reality whatsoever. Examples include specific anecdotes of rape perpetrated by Muslims that actually never happened, just to stir up anti-Muslim sentiment. To conflate these sorts of hoaxes with what the mainstream media engages in--which admittedly can be very biased at times--only further obscures the truth and sets a very dangerous precedent for objective journalism.  I'm not saying that the mainstream media is infallible, but there is a big difference between selective reporting and outright lies.    </TEXT>

Notice I didn't say she used a private email server for nefarious purposes, I said she mishandled confidential documents, which she admitted herself and isn't disputed by anyone.  It is also widely known that the Clinton Foundation received donations from entities in foreign nations including Saudi Arabia, this too is not disputed.  And finally, the last thing I said was based on the leaked private speech she gave to Goldman Sachs.  

And the funny thing is, despite all these flaws, I still voted for her. That's how much I disapprove of Trump.   </TEXT>

But seriously, when you are in the lower middle class working long hours and barely eeking out a living, unable to pay for a good education, unable to afford the prescription drugs you need, the last thing you are concerned about is race politics.  I guess you could construe that as tolerating racism, but I see it as people just caring a lot more about economic issues.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You asked me to answer two different things actually.  First, you ask me to "name a single subreddit that doesn't" ban dissent.  /r/HillaryClinton doesn't.  /r/politics doesn't.  They do however ban uncivil rude comments.  Then you ask whether another sub would tolerate my proposal.  My answer is, of course not.  I am not pretending to advocate equal treatment here. T_D is a special case that requires extreme measures. I am simply trying to propose a far more effective means than censorship.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The unit certainly has issues, but the new high ROF archetype fulfills a fantasy not seen in any other unit in SC2.  Balance and mechanics are important, but aesthetics and "feel" are also essential to creating an iconic unit. The old cyclone fired missiles that are basically indistinguishable from any number of other terran projectiles: marauder, viking, thor AA, widow mine, etc.  At least VISUALLY the new cyclone is very distinctive and exciting to look at, if not to use. This alone makes me hesitate from scrapping the design.  

I just think they could tweak the numbers a bit, and let the unit fire while moving to help with kiting. Think rapid-fire, ground-based Phoenix that could dance around slower armored units.   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-26 22:03:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I like the intention behind putting tactical jump and yamato cannon on independent timers, which allows the abilities to be used in quick succession.  However, once terran has 3-4 battlecruisers, he can essentially just scan and snipe down any building at will every 71 seconds, with zero risk or chance of counter play.  

Instead of the two timers, can we revert back to energy, but have both abilities cost 100 energy?  That way, a battlecruiser at full 200 energy can still perform both abilities consecutively, but at least it can be countered by EMP or feedback.  Additionally, it provides more flexibility, since the player can choose between double yamato cannon, double tactical jump, or a combination of the two. I think this is a more elegant implementation with the same benefits, but offers some chance of counter play.    </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ravens in 3.8 are simply too strong </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-26 21:54:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yes, Ravens have been seeing less play since the release of LOTV. But in the attempt to bring them back into meta, patch 3.8 takes things way too far.  In its current form, massing ravens and pushing out with autoturret spam is way more efficient and versatile than it should be. Maybe you could argue that one should never allow terran to amass that many ravens, but with the siege tank buffs, terran has an easier time turtling than before.  

I'm not arguing for weakening the raven. I believe units must be effective to be worthwhile at all. But the energy cost of the abilities should be increased so that it cannot be spammed as easily.  Seeker missile should cost 100 energy instead of 75, and turrets should cost 75 energy instead of 50.  What do you guys think about the current Raven? </TEXT>
