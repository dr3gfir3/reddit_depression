	<TEXT> Yeah, parking fucking sucks. I try to arrive ~30 minutes before my class, and then I just use whatever extra time to review material. 

Find lounges and other quiet spaces on campus where you can relax in between classes. My commute is 25 minutes, so I can't justify driving back-and-forth just because there's a 2-hour gap in between some of my classes. The library is great for this purpose, and it's a good time to get some homework out of the way if you're feeling particularly productive.

Finally, if you don't have a meal plan, bring your own lunch and coffee when you can. There's a burrito place and a Dunkin Donuts on my campus, and I wasted so much money my first semester. Don't fall into the habit of eating at on-campus dining just because it's convenient. The expenses will add up quickly! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whatever you end up doing, go onto the website for your university's bookstore and see what kind of deals they offer. Many schools partner up with major tech companies for discounts - I got $300 off my first MacBook that way. Best Buy also offers pretty good student discounts if you sign up with a university e-mail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Target is great for this. I have a really pretty daily planner that I got there for $12, which is very cheap for how much space they have for each day. They also have customizable planners in their dollar section - you can get the little binder and the filler pages for ~$10.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I think the medical implications motivate me more than anything, honestly. Severe heart disease, hypertension, and cancer run on both sides of my family. It was very easy to tell myself "I have plenty of time to fix my weight" when I was a teenager, but I'm now in my early 20s and realize that it's time for me to make some kind of significant change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, "how's the job search going?" is a huge one. My sister is nearly 30 y/o and struggles with pretty severe social anxiety, and nothing gets her more upset more than a "well-meaning" family member asking her if she's moved out of the house and gotten a full-time job yet. Even aside from that, it's just a generally shitty question to ask anyone, imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Getting all hot and sweaty. Gross, but seriously. I sleep with both the A/C and ceiling fan on high, and as much as I love cuddling, I'll push off my boyfriend as soon as I start to get even remotely warm. 

Also, sharing pillows. I have the pillow technique down to a science, and so I can't sleep comfortably if I don't have one for my head, one to cling onto, and one between my knees. Fortunately, my boyfriend is a weirdo and can sleep without any pillows whatsoever, so it works.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Worked at Sears for about three months, which is a "weird workplace experience" in and of itself. I've worked in a couple of other retail settings, but Sears was by far the most depressing. You get very few customers, and there's this sort of unmentioned but mutual knowledge between all of the employees that the store is bound to close eventually, no matter how many promotional displays and morale-boosting materials corporate shipped over to your store. (It's been almost two years since working there and they have, indeed, closed since I left.)

But anyways, I worked in footwear. Most of the store's customers were senior citizens, so I'd get a lot of older people coming in and getting *personally* angry with me, a lowly minimum-wage salesperson, that we no longer carried their favorite pair of shoes that they purchased in the store ten years prior. Had an older man come in and start mumbling about war stories and how he refused to buy any of our footwear if it was made in Asia.

But the strangest experience had to be an older woman who came into the store and began yelling at me in Polish. I shit you not, the only phrase I could make out was "filthy American communists." She would occasionally jerk her finger towards a pair of shoes, and I tried my hardest to get past the whole yelling-in-Polish part and hand her shoes in order to appease her, and eventually she sat on a bench, tried on a pair, threw them on the ground, and then left.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, one thing that has helped in the mean time is the Sleep Cycle app. I realize that it can't be *too* accurate, since it relies solely on your body's movement to detect the levels of sleep you're getting, but I have noticed in the 10 days that I've been using it that I seem to register very little REM sleep. I'm unsure what the implications are, but it's definitely something I want to refer to my doctor the next time I see him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, I absolutely agree about CFS not being all one thing. There are actually many medical professionals who don't believe in it as a diagnosis altogether, because it's almost always a symptom of something else, rather than a root cause. But thank you so much for the advice. 

How did you go about cutting out caffeine? That's honestly one of my biggest obstacles. I depend on it so heavily to the point that I have to drink copious (see also: probably unhealthy) amounts in order to even feel anything from it.  </TEXT>
