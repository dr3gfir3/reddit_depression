	<TEXT> Wow, this is a bigger story than the title first led me to believed. Even a co-founder of Wickr works for them.

Here are a couple other (definitely not all) highlights:

According to one source, DarkMatters newfound interest in offensive operations coincided with revelations contained in leaked emails that the Italian company Hacking Team had sold surveillance equipment to a large number of repressive regimes. Out of Hacking Teams ashes, DarkMatter rose

But what two sources and several security researchers The Intercept consulted were most concerned about was DarkMatters plan to become a certificate authority.

This was funny, remember that Hacking Team had their emails dumped on reddit:

**After the Hacking Team emails leaked in July, there were loud, angry meetings in CyberPoint offices  people deciding what to do now that their internal operations in the Middle East had been exposed to the world.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Mainstream media* misleads the public much more than it gives useful information.

Remember when one provided justification for invading Iraq (based on faulty intelligence)? When almost all of them accused Snowden of giving documents to China, being a Russian spy, being a narcissist (and ignored all the publications about mass surveillance after PRISM)? Pretty recently, one of them accused Snowden for disclosing programs not in the public interest - that they themselves published (and after Snowden obviously relied on them to publish only programs in the public interest).

Remember the Harvard study that revealed many US media outlets had referred to US brutal torture programs with euphemisms - but not foreign? Or when publishing Mark Klein's revelation of NSA - AT T eavesdropping was explicitly postponed until after a Presidential election? Refused to admit that the US bombed a hospital even after other outlets had, and days later begrudgingly wrote a long piece that admitted it but provided reasons why it was reasonable.

The list goes on   on   on. If you want, I can sit down and cite all of these examples with good sources (and maybe add more to the list as they come to mind). They do it perpetually.

	<TEXT> Well, escalating military conflict with a superpower is something to be taken carefully - which I'm not sure is happening. Cold War like scenarios are great for certain industries and tends to be really bad for activism, dissent, and free thought (which might be really bad if you think the US already has growing unaddressed domestic problems).

There's also bound to be an uptick in propaganda   misinformation, which will probably ruin open or informed discussion.

Wouldn't it be awesome though if it did just mean more transparency   accountability? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> every establishment politician

Not all are for it. Keep track of votes, there are some who vote against these expansions - but they are in the minority. And Presidential candidates are usually much more vetted by the early political process to ensure we rarely see those types of candidates. So you're right, we cannot rely on voting alone and expect much to happen.

But don't lose hope! There are always people resisting these trends, and doing little things can be cathartic in its own right. Simply opposing them on any level makes me feel better. Whether it's donating to the EFF (which are doing a fundraiser right now) or ACLU, staying up-to-date so I always have information at my fingertips, talking about the issues, or making surveillance harder with privacy or anonymity tools and/or habits, I'm resisting these trends.

Losing hope is the worst because that's exactly what elites stand to gain from; people going silent (from fear, disinterest, disappointment, etc). </TEXT>

This [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/4xuwxe/whenever_i_make_a_comment_about_how_slippery/d6j2dgg) and this [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/) cite articles and tools used for astroturfing. Even [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/09/internet_disinf.html) and Dan Carlin have acknowledged astroturfing. Dan Carlin is so removed from this type of topic that in his AMA, he asked redditors on if he should answer "top" or "best" comments and someone on twitter had to show him the term sockpuppeting; for him to even see this problem is telling.

It's ruining reddit as the discussions with people who had some spare time to talk about things they care about are being overrun by political   corporate agendas that have much more time to fill the discussion spaces and stymie open discussion. I think it's only going to get worse, and I have no idea how to even solve this problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that's the solution Schneier would ever advocate.

A big issue with that is such an expansion of powers can also cause new levels of damage to be done by secret government tools. If their tools break functionality, what kind of transparency is in place that let the public know?

The new plan to drastically expand the governments hacking and surveillance authorities is known formally as amendments to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the proposal would allow the government to hack a million computers or more with a single warrant. If Congress doesnt pass legislation blocking this proposal, the new rules go into effect on December 1.

But the Justice Department has given the public far too little information about its hacking tools and how it plans to use them. And the amendments to Rule 41 are woefully short on protections for the security of hospitals, life-saving computer systems, or the phones and electronic devices of innocent Americans.

Without rigorous and periodic evaluation of hacking software by independent experts, it would be nothing short of reckless to allow this massive expansion of government hacking.

If malware crashes your personal computer or phone, it can mean a loss of photos, documents and recordsa major inconvenience. But if a hospitals computer system or other critical infrastructure crashes, it puts lives at risk. Surgical directives are lost. Medical histories are inaccessible. Patients can wait hours for care. If critical information isnt available to doctors, people could die. Without new safeguards on the governments hacking authority, the FBI could very well be responsible for this kind of tragedy in the future.

The article continues to mention examples of government hacking tools being used against them and ways things can go wrong such as:

Indeed, damage happens even when changes are straightforward: recently an anti-virus scan shut down a device in the middle of heart surgery.

	<TEXT> Ladar Levison is awesome! He's given many talks since what happened. I remember one (either at MIT or Harvard) where be talked about the details of the story including how his judge was once a FISA judge (totally unbiased right?).

*details I wouldn't have otherwise known, highly recommend checking it out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bruce Schneier said this about the other corporate denial statements:

Other companies have been quick to deny that they did the same thing, but I generally don't believe those carefully worded statements about what they have and haven't done. We do know that the NSA uses bribery, coercion, threat, legal compulsion, and outright theft to get what they want. We just don't know which one they use in which case.

That doesn't at all take away from the Yahoo revelation, it just underscores how big a deal this surveillance issue is (and consequently, how important the privacy issue is). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure I'd put it past Microsoft either though. 

[Recent story mentions Microsoft's cooperation with NYC in regards to surveillance.](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/a-walking-tour-of-new-yorks-massive-surveillance-network/)

The building is home to the citys Domain Awareness System, which collects and analyzes information from police cameras, radars, license plate readers and more. The Domain Awareness System was built in partnership with Microsoft, which is selling the software to other cities, with New York getting a cut of the profits.

The fact they patented the ability to intercept Skype calls and also sell software to [analyze facial expressions of crowds for political purposes in realtime](https://theintercept.com/2016/08/04/microsoft-pitches-technology-that-can-read-facial-expressions-at-political-rallies/) doesn't strengthen my trust either.

I also remember an Oracle executive defended the surveillance described in the Snowden documents. So I get the feeling most big tech companies are suspect of government ties, but it is interesting reading that many have resisted certain types of government requests. There's definitely complexity to corporate-government relations that we don't fully know about yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WikiLeaks plans to release documents pertaining to Google and the US electoral system over the next 10 weeks, the organization announced today. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange announced the planned release schedule in a video address at the end of a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday morning, where the organization was celebrating its 10th anniversary.

The upcoming releases would follow WikiLeaks' publication in July of more than 19,000 emails from seven top officials in the Democratic National Convention (DNC). The emails, which included full names, phone numbers, and addresses, suggested that the DNC favored Clinton over her primary rival, Bernie Sanders, and led to the resignation of chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

Asked whether the upcoming releases would "destroy" Clinton, Assange appeared to downplay expectations. "Are upcoming publications significant in relation to the US election? Yeah, we think they're significant," he said. "Do they show interesting features of US power factions and how they operate? Yes, they do."

Assange also denied accusations that he and his organization are specifically targeting Clinton and the Democratic Party. "I certainly feel sorry for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump," he said. "These are two people who are tormented by their ambitions, in different ways."

On the last point, I'm pretty sure he likened the two major party candidates as choosing between "cholera or gonorrhea." Also, can anyone imagine if Assange decided to do this:

Assange originally planned to announce today's release **from the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London,** where he has been living in asylum since 2012. But WikiLeaks canceled his appearance this week, citing "security concerns." </TEXT>
