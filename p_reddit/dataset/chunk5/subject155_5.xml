Personally I don't think it's suitable for this country because the United States is literally a nation of immigrants. It's unique in the world (with the possible exception of Israel) and shouldn't be too selective with immigration. We want people from everywhere, including the third world. </TEXT>

Even if the cost of production tripled Apple would make a major profit by keeping the price the same. Apple is a niche brand.

He is concerned with getting dangerous criminals out of the country but he has compassion for others when families are involved. The difference between Trump and previous presidents is that he recognizes the need to prevent new illegals from entering the country, otherwise it's an insult to the immigration laws to keep granting amnesty to new arrivals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now the government consists of two forces. Not Republicans and Democrats, Republicans and the White House. Republicans don't personally like Trump that much but their voters do. He is more popular with Republican voters than virtually anyone else. 9 in 10 Republican voters support him, and the number is growing. The party can't ask its voters to take sides because Trump will win that every time. It's a positive thing because the Republican party itself wants to do some truly terrible things to the country and it can't while Trump is the one with the pen. They have to do things his way, and his way is better for the American people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a number of documents linked here:

http://www.fairus.org/issue/noncitizens-voting-violations-and-u-s-elections

From past information I've read the percentage of non-citizens who vote is somewhere close to 10%. When I came to this country my lawyer mentioned the not voting thing to me but I could imagine many people who did not have the benefit of a lawyer might not understand that they are not supposed to vote until they become citizens.

Citizens must be protected too of course. A citizen, even one who has served time in prison, must be permitted to cast a vote, and their ID would be their ticket to entry into the polling booth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What proponents of illegal immigration are defending is little better than slavery. A separate class of people to be exploited, working for little to no compensation depending on their situation, unequal in society, without any of the protections enjoyed by legals, at constant threat of being turned in to the authorities if they fail to work hard enough. And this idea of 'trickle up' simply doesn't work. Importing more and more people at ever lower pay doesn't cause everyone else to move up the economic ladder, it puts those at the bottom out of work and onto welfare (if welfare exists.) </TEXT>

At the moment it looks like Trump's first term is going similarly to that of Bill Clinton, who started with an approval rating of 55% and sunk quickly to 37% before beginning to climb again. Trump is currently on the upswing from a similar dip.

	<TEXT> Trump is unlikely not to land a second term but the Congress is unlikely to hold its lead. 2018 is an abnormality as the Republicans have a significant advantage in terms of the open seats, but after that they will almost certainly suffer a big defeat and Trump will have to work with a Congress of Democrats. </TEXT>
