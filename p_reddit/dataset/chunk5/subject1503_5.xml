	<TEXT> I was a Methodist while I was growing up, but over time lost my faith in any organized religion.  Before massive amounts of information and peers were available via the internet I had to figure out where I stood on this subject on my own.  I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this and it being a bit more difficult to figure out one's faith before the "nets".

I'm respectful of anyone's religion (SO is a devout Catholic) the only thing I ever ask is to be respectful of my beliefs(or lack thereof) and not try and shove it down my throat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought my SO a replica of Hadhafang or Arwen's sword from LoTR.  Apparently she has wanted a sword for a long time but no one ever listened to her and instead got her brother one.

Today I have work till 5PM, no lunch as I have to go to class, and then a class after I get off from 6-9PM.  The awesomeness of this item would: 

1) Brighten my day 
2) Remind me yet again that this sub is fantastic 
3) Give me something to look forward to as I repeat this schedule again tomorrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm also a new person and let me first state that I am loving this sub so far.  I've already gifted 2 people and have enjoyed quite a few discussions.  I'm looking forward to being an even more active participant in the future. 

I agree with you completely that this isn't a sub to "get free stuff".  To me this is a place to chat with a great group of people and help make someone's day a bit better! </TEXT>
