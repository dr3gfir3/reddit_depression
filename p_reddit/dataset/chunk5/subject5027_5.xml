	<TEXT> Lets not forget our nuclear role, Canada normally supplies approximately 75% of the worlds supply of Cobalt-60 used to sterilize 45% of the worlds single-use medical supplies. We were once the top supplier of nuclear reactors to the world as well.

Canada has the longest coastline of any country in the world at 243,977 kilometers  151,600 miles.

Our second language record, Montreal is the worlds second largest French speaking city after Paris.

The longest highway in the world is the Trans-Canada Highway which is over 7604 kilometers (4725 miles) in length.

Alert, inNunavutTerritory, is the northernmost permanent settlement in the world.

The border between Canada and the United States is officially known as the International Boundary. It is 5,525 miles long, including the 1,538 miles between Canada and Alaska. Its the worlds longest unprotected border.

We enjoy long walks on the beach and quiet candlelit dinners and mostly hate Trump. We like dogs. It took us almost a hundred years to decide on our flag. We celebrated Thanksgiving before the Americans historically and every year we celebrate before them again, just so we know what's what. We like Keanu Reeves. Focus on that actually. Just talk about Keanu Reeves for an hour

	<TEXT> Hey so I did some rooting around and it is in fact a Chinese based clone of the Famicom, and ran for numerous years in high production. Closing production in 1994 and owned in the end by a Taiwanese company TXC.
It was generally sold with a pin-adaptor allowing it to play official Famicom releases as well as it's own games (of which I'm having a hard time pinning down exactly how many were produced and by whom)
You're not getting many replies because it predominantly existed in markets that early Nintendo did not attempt to break into, thus it's users probably don't speak English as a first language. 
It has various versions, some were produced in massive numbers by TXC, others not so much. Checking world wide markets (thank you google translate) it's still selling at roughly $150 used, sometimes CIB, which likely suggests it still exists in decent numbers but is entering collector's status.
Best i could do! Happy collecting! </TEXT>
