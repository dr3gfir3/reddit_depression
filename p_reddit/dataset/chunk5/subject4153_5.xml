I'm not saying they're not, I just know that there's a woman walking around guilt free who introduced adult subjects and activities to me when I was way too young and the age gap was creepy. When I told friends and a few adults later they simply wrote it off as me "scoring" with an older chick.  </TEXT>

Watching the men and woman that tried to save him work so fucking hard really challenged me to be a better person and to give a fuck about others.

	<TEXT> So I bought this thing online some time ago called an Aztec Death Whistle. A resin/epoxy skull that you can blow into and it makes the sound of a lady demon screaming. My sister was home alone and I still have mail that arrives at my mom's place so I stopped by around 10am to pick up a few things. I had just received my whistle at the time and I wanted to freak my sister out so when I opened the door I began making the whistle chirp in shorts bursts. This got my sisters attention in one of the rooms and I was in a blind spot next to the kitchen out of her line of sight. Once I heard her exit her room to see what was going on I began to make the whistle scream. I heard her fall and scramble to get in her room, When I felt she had enough I went to see what she was doing and she had her arm cocked back with an xbox controller at hand. She had a look in her eye like she had accepted death at the hands at what ever she imagined was making the noise. SHe pitched the controller at me when she saw it was me and dunked a glass of water on my head hahahahaha


This is the exact thing that I bought.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I used to spend weekend shifts working for a medical growing operation doing security work for an outdoor field. I had some basic training from a security group but mostly I was just a clipper getting paid over time to make sure hikers, wildlife, and trespassers didn't mess with the out door plants. You really have to get over how far away you feel from everything, you reply scenes from horror movies a lot just to kind of spook your self without really having much control over why. 

I know it's not exactly solitude but I had an issue with my partner once. You see we were given hunting rifles to patrol the and with because of pain in the ass deer that loved to eat our crops and armed thieves that other guards had already had violent run ins with. I'd done my shifts alone for some time but they decided to give me a partner so that we could alternate walk throughs while both sides of the property still had eyes on them at all times.

I wont give his name, but I can describe him as very.. Columbine. He had a fascination with weapons and he was very awkward and didn't really know how to connect on a social level despite my best attempts to make small talk and befriend the person I was forced to spend almost 48 hour shifts with. Most days were uneventful except for the small game hunting here or there. But one day I had my eyes behind the spotter scope panning over the edge of the property maybe three hundred yards out while my soup came to a boil. When I saw a rustling of two hikers in out south east crops. I mentioned to my partner that we had activity and he sprung to my berm with his rifle at hand. He racked a round into the chamber and began scanning for them. I was in shock, his safety was off and he didn't even bother to ask if they were armed. I pointed his barrel down and and asked him what the fuck he was doing. "They're tresspassing man, they walked right by the signs, we're in our right. You don't know if they're strapped ! They could blow us away !," 

Our land neighbored an area that had a light hiker traffic and the occasional back packer. I yelled at him while trying to wrestle his barrel to the floor that they had back packs and hiker clothes and I couldn't see any weapons on either of them. After a few minutes of panicked debate I eventually got him to agree to come with me with his safety on and we'll handle the situation. It was only 200 yards but it felt like the longest walk of my life with columbine murdering behind me the whole way "We're in our right.. if we get smoked it's your fucking fault... fucking pussy going to get us killed.. we don't know how many more are out there..." I couldn't have him lead the way and risk him shooting some idiot hiker but I hated having him behind me with that gun. 

Once we were within thirty feet I whistled to grab the attention of the male hiker. He turned in my direction and what I assume to be his girlfriend froze like deer in the head lights. I let them know that they were trespassing and that they probably ignored a sign to be here, that if they took anything from the plants that were not ready to be harvested they already ruined what they took so they could keep what they already had. I let them know that if they made any sudden movements or took out any sort of weapon that the gentlemen behind me had no problem with putting them both down. The woman was trembling and couldn't speak though her mouth occasional moved as though she meant to. The man agreed and said they'd stay clear of the property.  </TEXT>

Tunnels are a thing that are already in place and if you're a southern californian or a texan you know that there are several bodies of water that cannot just be walled off. Plus your main issue isn't even the border, it used to be easy for people to come and go as they pleased and make a life in mexico and business in the US. But now that the borders are being locked down more and more people are just overstaying their work and school visas and that's where your numbers really come in. (Keep in mind that usually if you're here on a school or work visa than statistically speaking you're not a criminal of any caliber that Mr. Pumpkin Head has mentioned) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ohhh i'm aware that there are illegal immigrants entering the US. But are we really going to lower ourselves to a North Korean tactic ? Did you think that he was going to build a Great Wall of America ? It's going to be a DMZ. He has no idea how to handle this issue with the care it needs. Of course something needs to be done, but his way is not the way.   </TEXT>

Your choices were between Hillary, the up and comming nurse who has some how managed to cover up that shes been behind the preventable neglected deaths of several patients in the passed four months. Or Donald, the guy who owns a mini-mall down the street and a failing strip club in the next town over.  </TEXT>

I'd be a little depressed that I hadn't had some sort of grand adventure yet. But happy that I was a stable self sufficient human being. Also planning on heading across the Atlantic for the first time in December so suck it baby me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dating website, I had basically exhausted my social circle for any real romantic possibilities. I'd had some luck with random encounters here or there but nothing that developed into anything other than a few dates and some one nighters. But I finally gave my ego a rest and tried a dating website for the first time. For a bit a ran into more awkward dates and one nighters but after some hiccups I think i found the girl I want to marry. It started off as a decision that I was just toying around with and now I'm in a committed relationship of almost four years, living together for three.  </TEXT>
