	<TEXT> Hey guys, i have been an active player in optc for 2 years now, and i have always been enjoying the game so much that i have to open the game atleast 10 times everyday. But lately, i have been losing much interest in the game, like i open it, play to get the gems and maybe farm some stuff but am not feeling excited and having fun at all. I really enjoy OPTC and want to keep playing it. Any tips that would help cure my interest loss would be highly appreciated. </TEXT>
