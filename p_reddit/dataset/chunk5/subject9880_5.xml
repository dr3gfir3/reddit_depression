	<TEXT> Well, I don't really think so. I mean, the vast majority of people would be shaken, scared, disturbed, sad, shocked etc etc. Some people could even be happy, point being there would be some emotion, this just reads as null. 
There's just no emotion, and I find it makes the story seem lacking. It's not unreasonable to expect a reaction so close to an event. I didn't specify that the author should be 'an incoherent mess' and I didn't even claim that there he should be acting like other people, or in a specific manner. 

Really, I stated an opinion and you've inferred a bunch of extra points lol. </TEXT>

However, your old school might be able to name the sub. Or the old teacher might remember who subbed her class while she was away. Another thing to do might be to research for similar cases of fly delusions etc, in the area. Seeing if you get any information that way. </TEXT>

Maybe have them look after the baby for a few days, to bond, allow you rest and keep the baby safe.
