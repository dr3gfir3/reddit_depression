	<TEXT> The one time I tried Ryanair, I checked in early, was issued a boarding pass, went to the airport the next day, had the computer claim there was an error with said boarding pass, paid for a second pass ($37), and got to the gate for my delayed flight.

After the extra wait, they then refused to board me, claiming that my boarding pass, which they had issued me TWICE, was invalid because of a passport issue. Even though I entered all my passport information twice and was issued a pass without issue twice. Took me two months to get hold of a real person to complain, that person refused to take even partial responsibility and decided that it was proper for them to keep my money for a flight they never let me take.

I loved Ireland, I hated Ryanair. Never, ever again. </TEXT>
