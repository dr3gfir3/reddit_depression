**Abstract:**

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a causal factor in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Statins have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular events in large outcome trials, findings that have made them the therapeutic cornerstone of clinical practice.1 Despite the proven efficacy of statins, there is considerable variability in individual responses to these drugs.2 Furthermore, some observational data suggest that as many as half of persons who begin statin therapy discontinue it within a year.3 Moreover, among patients receiving statin therapy who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and who have persistent elevation of LDL cholesterol levels, the rates of cardiovascular events remain high, necessitating the development of additional therapies.
The discovery that the serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisinkexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor affords an additional route through which LDL cholesterol levels in plasma can be controlled.4 Initial therapeutic approaches to reducing circulating levels of PCSK9 have focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies. This approach sequesters virtually all PCSK9 in the reticuloendothelial system, thus preventing it from binding to the LDL receptor.5,6 Circulating PCSK9 is derived almost entirely from the liver7; hence, therapeutic approaches that target hepatic production of PCSK9 may offer an alternative to the use of monoclonal antibodies.
RNA interference and related RNA silencing pathways provide an opportunity to harness a highly specific endogenous mechanism for regulating gene expression.8 Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) selectively and catalytically silence the translation of their complementary target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in a sequence-specific manner through the formation of effector RNA-induced silencing complexes.9,10 Inclisiran is an investigational, chemically synthesized siRNA molecule that has produced sustained hepatocyte-specific, PCSK9-specific RNA silencing in healthy volunteers to 84 days after administration.11 Here, we present the results of the phase 2 ORION-1 trial, a dose-finding trial evaluating the efficacy of different inclisiran dosing regimens among patients who have elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving the maximum possible dose of a statin and who are considered to be at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Within the limits of the trial, we also evaluated the safety and efficacy of inclisiran in lowering LDL cholesterol levels. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

**Background**
Obtaining population-level estimates of the incidence and prevalence of dementia is challenging due to under-diagnosis and under-reporting. We investigated the feasibility of using multiple linked datasets and capturerecapture techniques to estimate rates of dementia among women in Australia.

**Methods**
This work is based on the Australian Longitudinal Study on Womens Health. A random sample of 12,432 women born in 19211926 was recruited in 1996. Over 16 years of follow-up records of dementia were obtained from five sources: three-yearly self-reported surveys; clinical assessments for aged care assistance; death certificates; pharmaceutical prescriptions filled; and, in three Australian States only, hospital in-patient records.

**Results**
A total of 2534 women had a record of dementia in at least one of the data sources. The aged care assessments included dementia records for 79.3% of these women, while pharmaceutical data included 34.6%, death certificates 31.0% and survey data 18.5%. In the States where hospital data were available this source included dementia records for 55.8% of the women. Using capturerecapture methods we estimated an additional 728 women with dementia had not been identified, increasing the 16 year prevalence for the cohort from 20.4 to 26.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.2, 26.8%).

**Conclusions**
This study demonstrates that using routinely collected health data with record linkage and capturerecapture can produce plausible estimates for dementia prevalence and incidence at a population level. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

A more anteriorly positioned foramen magnum evolved in concert with bipedalism at least four times within Mammalia: once in macropodid marsupials, once in heteromyid rodents, once in dipodid rodents, and once in hominoid primates. Here, we expand upon previous research on the factors influencing mammalian foramen magnum position (FMP) and angle with four new analyses. First, we quantify FMP using a metric (basioccipital ratio) not previously examined in a broad comparative sample of mammals. Second, we evaluate the potential influence of relative brain size on both FMP and foramen magnum angle (FMA). Third, we assess FMP in an additional rodent clade (Anomaluroidea) containing bipedal springhares (Pedetes spp.) and gliding/quadrupedal anomalures (Anomalurus spp.). Fourth, we determine the relationship between measures of FMP and FMA in extant hominoids and an expanded mammalian sample. Our results indicate that bipedal/orthograde mammals have shorter basioccipitals than their quadrupedal/non-orthograde relatives. Brain size alone has no discernible effect on FMP or FMA. Brain size relative to palate size has a weak influence on FMP in some clades, but effects are not evident in all metrics of FMP and are inconsistent among clades. Among anomaluroids, bipedal Pedetes exhibits a more anterior FMP than gliding/quadrupedal Anomalurus. The relationship between FMA and FMP in hominoids depends on the metric chosen for quantifying FMP, and if modern humans are included in the sample. However, the relationship between FMA and FMP is nonexistent or weak across rodents, marsupials, and, to a lesser extent, strepsirrhine primates. These results provide further evidence that bipedal mammals tend to have more anteriorly positioned foramina magna than their quadrupedal close relatives. Our findings also suggest that the evolution of FMP and FMA in hominins may not be closely coupled.

**Abstract:**

The anterior position of the human foramen magnum is often explained as an adaptation for maintaining balance of the head atop the cervical vertebral column during bipedalism and the assumption of orthograde trunk postures. Accordingly, the relative placement of the foramen magnum on the basicranium has been used to infer bipedal locomotion and hominin status for a number of Mio-Pliocene fossil taxa. Nonetheless, previous studies have struggled to validate the functional link between foramen magnum position and bipedal locomotion. Here, we test the hypothesis that an anteriorly positioned foramen magnum is related to bipedalism through a comparison of basicranial anatomy between bipeds and quadrupeds from three mammalian clades: marsupials, rodents and primates. Additionally, we examine whether strepsirrhine primates that habitually assume orthograde trunk postures exhibit more anteriorly positioned foramina magna compared with non-orthograde strepsirrhines. Our comparative data reveal that bipedal marsupials and rodents have foramina magna that are more anteriorly located than those of quadrupedal close relatives. The foramen magnum is also situated more anteriorly in orthograde strepsirrhines than in pronograde or antipronograde strepsirrhines. Among the primates sampled, humans exhibit the most anteriorly positioned foramina magna. The results of this analysis support the utility of foramen magnum position as an indicator of bipedal locomotion in fossil hominins. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The evolutionary reasons for variation in nose shape across human populations have been subject to continuing debate. An import function of the nose and nasal cavity is to condition inspired air before it reaches the lower respiratory tract. For this reason, it is thought the observed differences in nose shape among populations are not simply the result of genetic drift, but may be adaptations to climate. To address the question of whether local adaptation to climate is responsible for nose shape divergence across populations, we use QstFst comparisons to show that nares width and alar base width are more differentiated across populations than expected under genetic drift alone. To test whether this differentiation is due to climate adaptation, we compared the spatial distribution of these variables with the global distribution of temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity. We find that width of the nares is correlated with temperature and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity. We conclude that some aspects of nose shape may indeed have been driven by local adaptation to climate. However, we think that this is a simplified explanation of a very complex evolutionary history, which possibly also involved other non-neutral forces such as sexual selection. </TEXT>

**Highlights**

* -Aging quantifies determinants of individuals appearing younger/older than peers
* TMEM106B and GRN variants interact genetically in the regulation of -aging
* The role of TMEM106B in aging appears CNS region and life-stage selective
* TMEM106B modulates CNS inflammatory and degenerative changes independently of disease

**Summary**
Human age-associated traits, such as cognitive decline, can be highly variable across the population, with some individuals exhibiting traits that are not expected at a given chronological age. Here we present differential aging (-aging), an unbiased method that quantifies individual variability in age-associated phenotypes within a tissue of interest, and apply this approach to the analysis of existing transcriptome-wide cerebral cortex gene expression data from several cohorts totaling 1,904 autopsied human brain samples. We subsequently performed a genome-wide association study and identified the TMEM106B and GRN gene loci, previously associated with frontotemporal dementia, as determinants of -aging in the cerebral cortex with genome-wide significance. TMEM106B risk variants are associated with inflammation, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits, even in the absence of known brain disease, and their impact is highly selective for the frontal cerebral cortex of older individuals (65 years). The methodological framework we describe can be broadly applied to the analysis of quantitative traits associated with aging or with other parameters. </TEXT>

Our finding that the association grew stronger when parents became older is further in agreement with research suggesting that childless people face support deficits only towards the end of life, the scientists said.

I see you edited your "Doctor heal thyself" bit out. I have no stake in this, I don't have children and will likely not have children. There are likely many factors and variables that lead to long life and one of them seems to possibly be children, as per how this study seems to line up (as the author states) with other studies.  </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Fluorescence, the absorption of short-wavelength electromagnetic radiation reemitted at longer wavelengths, has been suggested to play several biological roles in metazoans. This phenomenon is uncommon in tetrapods, being restricted mostly to parrots and marine turtles. We report fluorescence in amphibians, in the tree frog Hypsiboas punctatus, showing that fluorescence in living frogs is produced by a combination of lymph and glandular emission, with pigmentary cell filtering in the skin. The chemical origin of fluorescence was traced to a class of fluorescent compounds derived from dihydroisoquinolinone, here named hyloins. We show that fluorescence contributes 1829% of the total emerging light under twilight and nocturnal scenarios, largely enhancing brightness of the individuals and matching the sensitivity of night vision in amphibians. These results introduce an unprecedented source of pigmentation in amphibians and highlight the potential relevance of fluorescence in visual perception in terrestrial environments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One *possible* take-home seems to be people without children face deficits in support towards the end of their lives and having children keeps that issue at bay. Having a child take care of you leads to a longer lifespan.

**A reminder to please keep on topic**, whether or not you personally want children is not relevant to the discussion about this study.

Full and free journal article [*Payback time? Influence of having children on mortality in old age*](http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2017/01/30/jech-2016-207857).

**Abstract:**

**Background** It is known that parents have lower mortality than childless individuals. Support from adult children to ageing parents may be of importance for parental health and longevity. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between having a child and the risk of death, and to examine whether the association increased at older ages when health starts to deteriorate and the need of support from a family member increases.

**Methods** In this nationwide study, all men and women (born between 1911 and 1925 and residing in Sweden), as well as their children, were identified in population registers and followed over time. Age-specific death risks were calculated for each calendar year for individuals having at least one child and for individuals without children. Adjusted risk differences and risk ratios were estimated.

**Results** Men and women having at least one child experienced lower death risks than childless men and women. At 60 years of age, the difference in life expectancy was 2 years for men and 1.5 years for women. The absolute differences in death risks increased with parents' age and were somewhat larger for men than for women. The association persisted when the potential confounding effect of having a partner was taken into account. The gender of the child did not matter for the association between parenthood and mortality.

**Conclusions** Having children is associated with increased longevity, particularly in an absolute sense in old age. That the association increased with parents' age and was somewhat stronger for the non-married may suggest that social support is a possible explanation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is the safe assumption, I agree. The article mentions that the more the chick begs the more attention it receives until the adult has reached a level of stress that is its maximum; triggering the selfish response. So still appropriate parents, but there is a limit.

There are plenty of organisms though that do sacrifice themselves to save their offspring during stressful times, but generally they do not have more than one or two chances to reproduce within their lifetime which isn't the case with auks. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Long-lived seabirds are good models to study the mechanisms that mediate the parentoffspring interactions. Contrary to studies under natural conditions, experimental manipulations allow us to assess the birds reactions in a short time period. We used the stress hormone corticosterone as an independent experimental factor to simulate the stress reaction, to examine changes in the behaviour of Little Auk chicks and parent birds. In the first experiment, we hypothesised that after enhancement of the corticosterone level Little Auk (Alle alle) chicks intensify their begging performance and attain a higher pre-fledging body mass than the control chicks. In the second experiment, we hypothesized that parent Little Auks with an increased corticosterone level feed their chicks less frequently and spend less time at the colony than their untreated partners and the control birds. We also expected that chicks with one parent implanted with corticosterone fledge later and with a lower body mass than chicks of two untreated parents. The obtained results supported the above hypotheses. We demonstrated that modification of begging performance in Little Auks constitutes an adaptive mechanism that guards against the decrease in the chicks body condition during stressful periods. Even though the provisioning rate in Little Auks can be regulated according to the chicks needs (expressed by the intensity of the begging display), it appears that adult birds regulate their provisioning strategy primarily according to their body state. The results suggest that parent Little Auks under stressful conditions will decrease their parental effort and redirect the available energy towards self-maintenance. The study provides novel insights into the behaviour of long-lived alcids using an experimental approach on free-living birds. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> When parent little auks are stressed, they reduce offspring feeding and spend more time searching for themselves. If their own chance of survival is reduced due to food shortage or weather conditions they focus on themselves and spend more time looking for their own food than for their chick. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's always okay to ask questions, never apologize for that!

It would not have happened anyway as we have moved past any natural warming cycles.

According to the [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock/science/retreat-glaciers-glacier-national-park?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects), retreat of this magnitude is due to global climate change. The park has become a big focus on what climate change can do and is doing. 

While there would be a natural retreat and then advance in a cooling vs warming cycle, we have gone far beyond what we would consider normal based on past climate information gathered through ice and soil cores, records of oxygen isotopes, and other means. There's a wonderful Ted Talk [here](http://www.ted.com/talks/lee_hotz_inside_an_antarctic_time_machine) on ice core data I showed my students this week; I recommend it if you have 9 1/2 minutes to spare. It shows the effort scientists are going through to accumulate this type of data.

The [National Parks Service also has a great explanation here](https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/nature/climate-change.htm).

[Here is another article](http://www.alternet.org/environment/why-glacier-national-park-poster-child-climate-change) with photos showing the difference over the years.          </TEXT>

I am fairly certain the species pictured in the gif are [Common murres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_murre) (*Uria aalge*). This species has one chick at a time and once it hits the water the males will take care of the chick full time until it can go off on its own.

Journal Article link for the article [*Variation in Growth Drives the Duration of Parental Care: A Test of Ydenbergs Model*](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/691097)

**Abstract:**

The duration of parental care in animals varies widely, from none to lifelong. Such variation is typically thought to represent a trade-off between growth and safety. Seabirds show wide variation in the age at which offspring leave the nest, making them ideal to test the idea that a trade-off between high energy gain at sea and high safety at the nest drives variation in departure age (Ydenbergs model). To directly test the model assumptions, we attached time-depth recorders to murre parents (fathers [which do all parental care at sea] and mothers;  of each). Except for the initial mortality experienced by chicks departing from the colony, the mortality rate at sea was similar to the mortality rate at the colony. However, energy gained by the chick per day was 2.1 times as high at sea compared with at the colony because the father spent more time foraging, since he no longer needed to spend time commuting to and from the colony. Compared with the mother, the father spent 2.6 times as much time diving per day and dived in lower-quality foraging patches. We provide a simple model for optimal departure date based on only (1) the difference in growth rate at sea relative to the colony and (2) the assumption that transition mortality from one life-history stage to the other is size dependent. Apparently, large variation in the duration of parental care can arise simply as a result of variation in energy gain without any trade-off with safety. </TEXT>

I love popping in and putting a fact up for the day, but it's tough to get here every day as I have students and research and other life obligations.

So, all that being said, let's get some facts going! No more news article titles which were kind of lazy anyway. You guys deserve better. :)

Thank you for your time as users to come hang out in our small corner of Reddit!

	<TEXT> We actually are not sure. There was a great [Mental Floss interview](http://www.mentalfloss.com/article.php?id=61532) with an aquarist:

Good question, and one that researchers are still trying to answer. They know Cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish) match their skin to their surroundings using their eyesight. But whats perplexing is that octopuses are actually colorblind. Its possible they can distinguish between different polarization of light better than humans can, but the exact method for how they identify color is unknown.

	<TEXT> It's not a learned behavior, so very unlikely we will ever naturally form this adaptation. Frogs and toads are unique in having rods with two different sensitivities, which is not found in any other vertebrates. 

Given frogs and toads are frequently found in dark crevices, burrows, dens, passages, etc. it is imperative they can find their way out in what we would perceive as total darkness. We do not have the same environmental stressors to cause this type of adaptation. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The presence of two spectrally different kinds of rod photoreceptors in amphibians has been hypothesized to enable purely rod-based colour vision at very low light levels. The hypothesis has never been properly tested, so we performed three behavioural experiments at different light intensities with toads (Bufo) and frogs (Rana) to determine the thresholds for colour discrimination. The thresholds of toads were different in mate choice and prey-catching tasks, suggesting that the differential sensitivities of different spectral cone types as well as task-specific factors set limits for the use of colour in these behavioural contexts. In neither task was there any indication of rod-based colour discrimination. By contrast, frogs performing phototactic jumping were able to distinguish blue from green light down to the absolute visual threshold, where vision relies only on rod signals. The remarkable sensitivity of this mechanism comparing signals from the two spectrally different rod types approaches theoretical limits set by photon fluctuations and intrinsic noise. Together, the results indicate that different pathways are involved in processing colour cues depending on the ecological relevance of this information for each task. </TEXT>

[NASA's page about the photo.](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170310.html) Explanation:

The galaxies of Abell 2666 lie far beyond the Milky Way, some 340 million light-years distant toward the high flying constellation Pegasus. Framed in this sharp telescopic image, the pretty cluster galaxies are gathered behind scattered, spiky, Milky Way stars. At cluster center is giant elliptical galaxy NGC 7768, the central dominant galaxy of the cluster. As the cluster forms, such massive galaxies are thought to grow by mergers of galaxies that fall through the center of the cluster's gravitational well. Typical of dominant cluster galaxies, NGC 7768 likely harbors a supermassive black hole. At the estimated distance of Abell 2666, this cosmic frame would span about 5 million light-years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello and thank you so much for being here to speak with us today.


We've done something similar with wolves in Yellowstone in the past; replacing them with a close sub-species (Northern Rocky Mountainswolf(*Canis lupus irremotus*) vs the Mackenzie Valleywolf (*Canis lupus occidentalis*) though not the original to keep the ecosystem healthy. While I understand the difference between a species and sub-species is minimal, I'm glad to see it seems to be working well so far. 

Island ecosystems seem to be much more fragile however. How difficult is it choosing the correct fill in species? It's easy for non-natives to run amok.

Can you share some your successes and failures of these projects? 

You're doing fascinating work and now more than ever conservation should be on our minds. Thank you again for sharing with us today.    </TEXT>

Rays are absolutely beautiful animals! This is an awesome gif. Manta rays ([*Manta* spp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manta_ray)) are actually fairly gentle and do not have stingers like their smaller cousins the [stingrays](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/stingray/) (by smaller I mean not by a whole lot, [here's a story](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150311-giant-stingray-largest-freshwater-fish-thailand-whiptail-animals/) about the largest freshwater stingray).

Mantas can get very large, such as the [Giant Oceanic Manta Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_oceanic_manta_ray) (*Manta birostris*) which can grow to 7 m (23 ft) and weigh about 1,350 kg (2,980 lb).

These beautiful, majestic animals are filter feeders ([here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c7PFsosGSk) of one feeding through a school of fish)! They do not have teeth, but instead [rows of tiny plates](https://a-z-animals.com/animals/manta-ray/) that funnel [plankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton) into their mouths as they move. [Here is a photo](http://otlibrary.com/wp-content/gallery/manta-ray/manta-ray-feeding-mouth-wide-open-maldives.jpg) of a Manta ray from the front, mouth open.

Mantas are found in the open ocean as well as along reefs; the [Reef manta ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef_manta_ray) (*Manta alfredi*) being another large example growing up to 4 m (13 ft) and found, you guessed it, near coral reefs. Our big friends the Giant oceanic manta rays spend most of their lives far from the shores and out in the wider ocean and according to Wikipedia is associated with offshore oceanic islands (which was news to me, I was only aware of the outer ocean habitat). 

Manta rays are a great Eco-tourism resource and you can frequently swim with them as a part of vacation and cruise packages! I swam with a few in the Carribean and it was an experience I will never forget. They were very curious!

They do need our help as far as conservation goes and life will only get more difficult as we see Climate Change advance, so if you are interested in lending a hand please check out these resources:

	<TEXT> Ecologist swimming by.

Those "feet" are actually the "penises", or [claspers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clasper), of the string ray. Through mating, the male inserts one clasper into her [cloaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca)(all purpose orifice for reproduction and waste removal) for insemination (having two makes it easier when you're floating/swimming, sharks have these as well). Usually, the male is a little smaller or the same size as the female as their mating attempts can be..well..vigorous..and you don't want to hurt the female. 

I've made a larger comment about rays in general in this post, but I'll add that comment here as well:

	<TEXT> Larger Pacific striped octopus, missed a word in the title.

This behavior is so odd because normally octopuses are pouncers.

According to Dr. Roy Caldwell at U.C. Berkley who studies this species:

Octopuses typically pounce on their prey or poke around in holes until they find something. When this octopus sees a shrimp at a distance, it compresses itself and creeps up, extends an arm up and over the shrimp, touches it on the far side and either catches it or scares it into its other arms.

For more information please see Berkely's press release [here](http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/08/12/octopus-shows-unique-hunting-social-and-sexual-behavior/).

I love cephalopods in general and have commented on them many times before. They are incredibly fascinating animals and their camouflage is amazing which we don't see much of in this gif, but I've talked about ti before in other posts.

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_squid)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

	<TEXT> Technically it is the highest mountain above sea level, but not the tallest mountain on Earth!

Mount Everest has a peak of 8,850 meters (29,035 feet, this varies slightly by source) above sea level. No other mountain on Earth has a higher altitude. 

Other mountains are taller as taller means "the total vertical distance between their base and their summit."

[Mauna Kea](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/visiting-mauna-kea/visiting-the-summit.html) is the tallest mountain on Earth (starting as an island) with an altitude of [4,205 meters (13,796 feet\)](http://geology.com/records/highest-mountain-in-the-world.shtml). Mauna Kea is over 10,000 meters tall compared to 8,850 meters for Mount Everest - making it the "world's tallest mountain."

	<TEXT> Most solar radiation is absorbed by Earth's surface (48%) and the rest by the atmosphere (23%) ([NASA Source](http://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page4.php)). If the incoming solar radiation is greater than the outgoing solar radiation the Earth will continue its temperature increase. This will then result in an increase in the outgoing radiation (please refer to the[Stefan-Boltzman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StefanBoltzmann_law) which states *outgoing radiation* increases faster than the temperature). The hotter the object, the more heat it puts off. Eventually the Earth will emit (outgoing) as much radiation as it is receiving and aradiative equilibriumwill be achieved.

Currently this is all kinds of borked due to greenhouse gases which are trapping the outgoing radiation and/or reflecting it back to the surface creating a feedback loop (in several ways).    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in. Cephalopod camouflage is awesome!

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_squid)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

	<TEXT> [NASA's picture explanation](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170223.html):

Seven worlds orbit the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, a mere 40 light-years away. In May 2016 astronomers using the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) announced the discovery of three planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. Just announced, additional confirmations and discoveries by the Spitzer Space Telescope and supporting ESO ground-based telescopes have increased the number of known planets to seven. The TRAPPIST-1 planets are likely all rocky and similar in size to Earth, the largest treasure trove of terrestrial planets ever detected around a single star. Because they orbit very close to their faint, tiny star they could also have regions where surface temperatures allow for the presence of liquid water, a key ingredient for life. Their tantalizing proximity to Earth makes them prime candidates for future telescopic explorations of the atmospheres of potentially habitable planets. All seven worlds appear in this artist's illustration, an imagined view from a fictionally powerful telescope near planet Earth. Planet sizes and relative positions are drawn to scale for the Spitzer observations. The system's inner planets are transiting their dim, red, nearly Jupiter-sized parent star. </TEXT>
