	<TITLE> Bonding - new litter box required? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-15 18:11:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Tomorrow, I'm picking up my two bunnies from their bunnymoon with a professional rabbit matchmaker and bonder.  I want to make sure that everything is great for them when they come home and that I don't ruin the great bonding they have done over the past week.

One of the pair is a recent widower, so everything I have right now belonged to him his past love.  The big rabbit pen that they used as a litter box is one of those items.  It is made out of plastic, so my husband says that I should just wipe it down with vinegar and it will be fine, but what do you think?  Is a new bunny pair able to use an old litter box that has just been wiped down thoroughly?  Should I just buy a new one?  As for their cardboard bunny mansion, the bonder says to just reintroduce it after a couple of weeks - but I still wonder about that too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to discuss it when she is calmer and more open to new ideas. My husband is the same way, and we have gotten to the point now where I can call him out on it, it just takes him awhile to deescalate. It only happened after laying the groundwork beforehand, though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Newspaper scammers </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-16 01:19:09 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I have lived here for a couple of years now, and have had the occasional teen trying to sell newspaper subscriptions at my door.  Didn't think much of it until today when a grown man tried to do the same thing.  After I told him I'd heard the pitch before about trying to fund raise for his school, he told me he just got out of juvie and his parole officer was making him do this so he could go to college.  Total bullshit.  When I told him that I wasn't interested and didn't have anything for him, he told me he wasn't begging because he wasn't a bum.  I said "Good Luck" and closed the door on him.  Anyway, it was very disconcerting - especially after reading about people doing this and then burglarizing houses.  I haven't experienced that yet, but it's still a scary thought.

Has anyone else experienced this?  Also, why does this happen here?  When I lived in L.A., I never got door-to-door scammers like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I pretty much love all styles of pixie, but am torn between getting a pixie and a bob.  My biggest concern is that it won't look good on my face shape and with my glasses.  I've spent hours scouring Pinterest for different styles, and just couldn't settle on one.  My hair is wavy and will not stay straight if it is humid out, so I am hoping for something that looks good wavy and is possibly longer in the front.  I would prefer something low maintenance, but will spend extra time if necessary.  I am a Kindergarten teacher, so I am hoping for something that looks professional as well.

	<TEXT> That makes sense.

I'm an elementary school teacher, and I am often at conferences and various professional developments.  Although I have met a few people, I haven't made any contacts that could help me find a job with a public district.  Most of the people I have met also work at charter schools (they're very big here in L.A.). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm married and a homeowner now, so stepping backwards into a sub position is not an option.  Plus, I already had to sub my first year with a credential and that's how I found this teaching job.  That was 6 years ago. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So-Cal Charter School Teacher: The struggle of getting a district position. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-06 03:27:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been stuck at the same charter school for 6 years now, and I would love to get a district job.  Everyone I know who has left my school has gone to another charter school, and every time I apply for a position at a public school I don't hear back - not even a call.

I have no idea why that is - are there no positions for newer teachers?  Am I somehow undesirable as someone who's worked at a charter school for so long?

For any of you who have been in similar situations or can answer my questions, please let me know.  I am starting to think that I will be stuck at this school forever. </TEXT>
