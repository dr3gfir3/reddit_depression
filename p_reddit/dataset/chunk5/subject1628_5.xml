	<TEXT> Chin up lads. Not the end, just the beginning. Anything can happen in the playoffs. Teams choke all the time. I know of a few years in the past decade where the Caps were chosen to win it all...did they?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Desirable plans native to Canada? (xpost r/seedswap) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-09 15:57:50 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, just starting to get into gardening and think the idea of seed swapping is brilliant. The only problem is, I don't have anything to swap yet.

My question is: Are there any plants native to Canada that are desirable to non-Canadians that I can look into acquiring to eventually trade?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot, very helpful. So in essence if I am growing palm trees, supplemental light would have to be considered? Are these crazy on your hydro bill?

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Total newbie here: How important are Zones when growing indoors? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello, total noob here. I have always loved palm trees when on vacation and me   the wife think it would be neat to try and grow some. I am in zone 5b (Canada) and understand we need to be mindful of cold-hardiness when choosing tree types, but how important is this when they will only be outdoors for spring   summer months?

Apologies if my question is completely off the rails, thanks in advance. </TEXT>
