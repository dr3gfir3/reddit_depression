	<TEXT> Thank you!! I remember when I stepped on the scale and it said 355.6. At that moment I was like, shit. I'm closer to being 400lbs than 300lbs. That terrified me. And I was 19 and only 5'3.  I realized then that eventually I would hit 400 and probably even higher if I didn't change, and that I really was killing myself. That moment really shook me </TEXT>
