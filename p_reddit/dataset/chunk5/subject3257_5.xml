	<TEXT> Congratulations on completely misunderstanding homelessness. I've been homeless and been in homeless communities in a few places. Yeah, there are addicts and their addictions cause them to have a harder time.

Very few actually decline a chance at a better life, addicted or not. And when they do, it isn't from the addictions. It's from the loneliness and depression (or other mental illness they have that is exasperated by homeless life) that comes overtime from being homeless. THAT'S what gets people stuck in those positions nearly every single time.

That, and in some places, there really is just no way out for some people

Which is way sadder than it simple being because addictions </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know. I feel like what I look like and my mental health are two of the biggest reasons I slipped into depression. Maybe. It's hard to even remember but I know I deal with them now. Which is fair, because I look fucking diseased. I look like I've been strung out on heroin or something. I'm pretty sure that's the impression I give people, anyway.

And I guess you could reasonably say I swim in my depression, because I've had it for quite a few years and never done anything about it but dwell on it and make myself feel worse about it.

Even if you "like" doing that, it still gets old as fuck. And I know life is easier without expectations and I've avoided those for a long time. But now I'm thinking maybe having some expectations of myself would be just what I need? Maybe not, but I'm not getting motivation anywhere so I don't know. It doesn't sound fun putting forth the effort to fill the expectation, but on the other hand I feel like fuck it, if I fail nobody has to know and I have the rest of my life to keep trying. And if I manage it, I'm going to get to be happy. So that way it feels low risk and high reward and I'm more comfortable taking something like that on.

I guess if I can feel this way others can too even if they have self image issues or if they're concerned with their state of mind.  </TEXT>
