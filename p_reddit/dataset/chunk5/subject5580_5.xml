	<TEXT> They have 128 tick servers and it is a great way to practice without having the looming threat of getting deranked all the time.
It is a very serious environment where you can play with people who actually care about doing well and working as a team.
On top of this there are free tournaments where you can play on teams and compete for faceit points.
It would be great if the community could grow on there like the EU side has.

	<TEXT> I think csgo lounge is great because it adds another dimension to the game that brings the communities to watch competatice games. I don't get mad however I just shrug it off and move on. The bet inspires me to cheer for a team and get into it. Some people however bring personal vendetas into it. People are going to abuse every system. Take into consideration they are doing a tournament for a BETTING site (ebets). I personally hate this and feel like it brings down the scene. The site is just trying to promote betting on their site. Maybe the DDOSer feels the same at me and doesn't want the site to run a good tournament.

edit: From my ipod excuse my grammar and spelling </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wrote an essay on the subject as I have suffered from is for many years:
Intro: I wrote this essay for my AP Language class. We had to pick a word and explain its meaning and how it has changed and what it means to you. A big part of this assignment was having a voice. I hope you enjoy. For those curious I got a 90%.
Essay: Over expression is the destruction of all language. When strict phrases lose their meaning there can no longer be words that fit the deep emotions and situations that occur in a lifetime. A word that means a lot to me is depression. I was diagnosed with depression at an early age and it isnt something I am particularly proud of. When I told friends and family that I had depression the questions that came up often were Why cant you just be happy? and Whats wrong? These questions are invalid when talking about the true kind of depression that exists. Over the years by over use and twisting, this deep and meaningful word has lost the one thing it exemplifies.
As I struggle through life one thing that has always hurt me deeply is that the word depression is used liberally. Oh man I have so much homework this is depressing. I cant go out to see my friends tonight I am depressed. The way depression is used in these sentences is not how the word should be utilized. Depression is a serious medical issue plaguing significant populations throughout the world. Depression isn't feeling sad like it is portrayed today. Depression could be seen as the black of emotions - it is not one emotion; it is the lack of emotions like how black is the absence of color. It is almost impossible to describe what exactly being depressed entails. When I become depressed I do not cry, I do not weep, I become someone I am not. I become an unmovable object. It is hard to feel anything when in a depressed state. All that I am able to register when I am depressed is a mild ache. I dont want to do anything, nothing productive, and certainly nothing for leisure. Staring off into the distance becomes the most attractive notion. Activities that I usually find fun lose their touch and with them I lose touch with reality. The episodes aren't triggered by situations, I can be having the time of my life but all of a sudden I just lose the entertainment value from what I am doing and fall into a pit of seeming despair. When asked why I feel depressed I can only answer, I dont know. A lot of people get angry when a person is depressed like it is their fault and they are just being babies. This is not so; It has been shown to be genetic - traveling through family lines like the plague. I got it from my dad and he got it from his dad. I am not an isolated case. Many of my friends have gotten their depression from their parents or family members. The only bonus of this is that people with depression can relate to others and arent alone. As much as this is a bonus it is also a drawback. As people see so many cases hatred for the condition becomes wide spread they begin to see it as an act as someone being attention seeking. This could not be farther from the truth. For the few that fake symptoms as a gig for attention there is an army of people pleading in the shadows afraid to seek help because they believe their friends and family will shun them.
Why has this problem gotten so out of hand? It is because of the use of the word in todays society. People have gotten sick of saying I feel sad this seems like baby talk to them. They want something sophisticated and mature so they go to the next step adding a deeper emotion. The scapegoat for this craving has become depression. An emotional rollercoaster that today seems to be cursed by having a word assigned to it. Since people say they are depressed all the time the ones with the serious cases are overlooked, they are seen as people just being sad. As time progresses and ignorance runs wild people like me can end up committing an act that cannot be reversed- suicide. Death is the final solution and how someone can be pushed so far to do it is unthinkable and is truly deserving of remorse. Sadly - extremely and utterly merciful is the fact that even death from depression has lost its meaning. I walk through school after a suicide case has been in the news and hear the unthinkable. I have been depressed before. This person just wanted attention by committing suicide. We should not publicize him or her, it is probably exactly what he or she wanted. I hear the same thing in a hundred different ways. It just blows my mind. How can a human life be valued so little? It can all be traced back to this word becoming a daily occurrence. Overtime everyone has begun to believe they have experienced depression because at one point or another they have been unhappy. I, defending someones life and legacy have argued directly with these people asking them how they can say such horrible things about a tragic death. They just say the same thing over and over again. I have experienced depression, so what I say is true. Going back to the first quotes in my literature I see what they believe is depression. A slight inconvenience, a days work, and anything that makes them go out of their way makes them their version of depressed. This is not how the word is supposed to be used. Adults and kids alike die everyday from being depressed. This is not because they are attention seeking and it is not because they are simply gloomy. One of the main reasons is because they dont know where they fit anymore. As the one word to describe this extreme emotion loses its meaning the people with the condition no longer feel like they fit anywhere. They begin to feel different, like they are the only person in the world who has these episodes. Along with feeling different they feel hopeless and truly useless. A species like ours that has such a capacity for compassion could save so many lives by just being thoughtful.
No one has the right to make someone feel isolated. Unknowingly this is what is happening as the word depression loses its meaning. People with this serious medical condition are starting to feel isolated from the whole. Depressed people are not different from anyone else, they are not attention seekers and they are not over exaggerating. People need to comprehend that using over complicated diction that they dont understand is not how you sound smart. Someone sounds smart by using accurate word choice as to not run the line of changing a word for the worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand where you are coming from and appreciate the criticism. Bit harsh on the grading haha. I wanted to show more of the changing of the word and how it alienates a group I guess not really all about the treatment. Words are powerful and the use of them has meaning. Thank you though for your interest. </TEXT>
