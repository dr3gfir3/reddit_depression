It took me a while to trust guys again. But right now im with someone who treats me the way every girl deserves to be treated.

Not once in my last relationship did I ever feel love in the slightest, now I get random phone calls and message all throughout the day just him telling me he how much he loves me.

I also have depression, and only my boyfriend knows. I dont want to tell my mother because she is severely disabled, and she herself struggles with day to day life. I dont think I can ever come clean to her and let her know I have depression, I think it would only make life worse for her, and I know she will blame herself because she cant be like other mums.
