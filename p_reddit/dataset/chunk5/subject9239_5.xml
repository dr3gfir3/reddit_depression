Read our constitution. I'll never believe in government the way you and your ilk do. That is why the U.S. is the greatest nation in the world's history. Socialism has failed its people time and time again. You can keep it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are truly misinformed. Typical for a liberal drone. As Obama said when he withdrew the last Americans troops without securing a Status of Forces agreement, " We leave behind a stable and free Iraq". Because of that fact a power vacuum was created, ripe for the organization of opposing factions like ISIS to infiltrate. So stop trying to rewrite history. An as an American citizen I've lived through the failures of the Obama administration and know just how he's fucked us and the rest of the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think Hillary could have swayed the mid-west. She lost because she couldn't turn out her base. The Republican vote was the same as the last election. A lot of conservatives turned out, but a lot of moderates didn't vote. Some of the Sanders supports voted for Trump, or didn't vote at all. Democrats had 6 millions fewer votes than the last election. A lot of those were the young voters who aren't energized unless you have an aberration running for President. </TEXT>
