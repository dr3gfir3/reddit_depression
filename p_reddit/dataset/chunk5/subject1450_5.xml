	<TEXT> Besides man, people are people and if you suck bad enough work ethic wise that you cant get a job because of someone else, you should probably take a look at how well you work and where you go to get a job.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah our managers are always freaking out about the time, yet the approval rating of the food or the quality is at a tremendous low. I got pissed one day and told them that if they didn't focus on speed and they focused on doing the job right, we wouldn't have to worry about time as much. If people couldn't wait they could leave but then the reverse would happen, people would be so happy with the quality they would find a time to come try the food.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im not saying that I specifically do not reheat things, I just find the way this content sort of went off into a depth kind of funny. I would wager and say we all have those moments where we say, ah what the hell. 
Although when you do live in that success mindset it tends to drive those what the hell moments down to a minimum.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the main point here is the void in most people, as the hot-pocket spins with the drone of the microwave in the background, no heed given to flipping or turning. As soon as the timer goes off, it gets taken far enough away, that even the cold center becomes another mere disappointment in life, so we make due, the coldness of the center passes,in the same way the thought of walking to reheat slipped away into the true cold center, that grasping void.  </TEXT>
