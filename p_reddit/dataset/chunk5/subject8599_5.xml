	<TEXT> NASA has new evidence that the most likely places to find life beyond Earth are Jupiter's moon Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus. In terms of potential habitability, Enceladus particularly has almost all of the key ingredients for life as we know it, researchers said.

New observations of these active ocean worlds in our solar system have been captured by two NASA missions and were presented in two separate studies in an announcement at NASA HQ in Washington today.
Using a mass spectrometer, the Cassini spacecraft detected an abundance of hydrogen molecules in water plumes rising from the "tiger stripe" fractures in Enceladus' icy surface. Saturn's sixth-largest moon is an ice-encased world with an ocean beneath. The researchers believe that the hydrogen originated from a hydrothermal reaction between the moon's ocean and its rocky core. If that is the case, the crucial chemical methane could be forming in the ocean as well.
"Now, Enceladus is high on the list in the solar system for showing habitable conditions," said Hunter Waite, leader of the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer team at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio and lead author of the Enceladus study. </TEXT>

They have a stockpile of tools to get started right now.

Federal leaders can decide on their own to offer buyouts and early retirement packages to their employees. They can even begin the long process of laying them off, citing agency restructuring as the reason. They can eliminate vacant positions altogether, or redraw their organization charts so that lower-level, lower-paid employees do the work done by higher-paid ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The radical left is filled with fury right now," Cruz, R-Texas, told radio host Chris Salcedo. "I mean, they're blind with rage. As a result, they're energized -- they will crawl over broken glass. And we knew they would show up, and they did show up."
Cruz, who made a Monday trip to Wichita, told the radio host that he stumped for GOP candidate Ron Estes because "the numbers were looking close" -- and that his party should view the narrow margin as a red flag.
"I think the election was certainly a warning sign," Cruz said.
RELATED: Republicans keep Kansas House seat in special election
There are dangers in reading too much into the Kansas race. Special elections, political operatives say, are like snowflakes -- each taking place in unique circumstances. In Kansas, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback is hugely unpopular. And national Democrats' refusal to spend money helping Thompson meant the race flew under the radar -- which some Democrats argued could have left Republican voters feeling no sense of urgency to turn out to vote.
The Georgia contest will be a much more accurate barometer of the national mood.
For weeks, money has flooded into the northern Atlanta suburbs. Democrat Jon Ossoff has raised $8.3 million -- and the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC have spent millions attacking him -- ahead of the 18-person "jungle primary." With a fractured, 11-candidate Republican field, Democrats hope Ossoff can cross the 50% threshold and avoid a June one-on-one runoff with the leading GOP candidate.
The race is also squarely focused on national issues and Trump in particular -- unlike Kansas, where Brownback was also a central factor.
In Kansas, Cruz campaigned alongside Estes, the state treasurer, on Monday, introducing him at a rally and calling on citizens to turn out to vote.
"The danger was that many good conservative Kansans wouldn't pay much attention to the election and wouldn't show up," Cruz said. "I wanted to do everything I could to help turnout."
RELATED: GOP cavalry heads to Kansas ahead of close House election
To avoid future losses, Republicans must follow through on pledges made to constituents, Cruz said.
"The way to do it is deliver on our promises," Cruz said. "That is what I am urging every day." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The FBI and Justice Department obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to monitor the communications of Page, who has called himself a junior member of Trump's foreign policy advisory team, as part of their investigation into possible ties between Trump's campaign and Russia, the newspaper says, citing unnamed law enforcement and other US officials.
The FBI and Justice Department obtained the warrant after convincing a FISA judge there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign government (Russia), the report says. The warrant presents the strongest information to date that the FBI had reason to believe a Trump adviser was in touch with Moscow and met with foreign operatives during Trump's presidential campaign. </TEXT>
