	<TEXT> I love this question, it's what I spent my time in America trying to figure out. I have several loosely connected ideas about America and why islamophobia is uniquely pervasive:

1) Americans no real understanding of 'social class', people are as self-conscious about being white in the US as they are about being middle-class in the UK.

2) The USA has an extremely simple history and would simply have not been possible without repression against Catholics, white genocide against Cherokees and other Indians, enslavement and then discrimination against blacks, internment of Asian Americans and Neo-Colonial wars. This is ironic, considering that the US's best cultural exports are jazz and hip hop which were musical responses to this kind of exploitation.

3) Americans are ridiculously patriotic - this doesn't mesh well when you're forced to confront the fact that none of your country's history would have been possible without racial oppression.

4) Being the 'great' is part of the American psyche. World police status and the desire to be number 1 in absolutely everything is absolutely essential to US self-image. This is reflected in everything from competitive US sports to the way kids are assessed in school to the uniquely oedipal foreign policy. 

5) The cold war is over, America has no simple enemy to prove itself against. 9/11 gave the US that enemy. The Islamist terrorist is almost too perfect to be true: its an ideological 'enemy within' that must always be beaten down like communism during the red scare whilst being physical targeted like certain states were during the cold war. 

6) America doesn't have a large Muslim population. Just as places in the UK that don't have many foreigners tend to vote UKIP, America is particularly Islamophobic because the 'Muslim threat' is entirely imaginary yet also impersonal. 

7) Facts don't matter in American politics. It's a criminal offense for a UK politician to knowingly lie, yet the practice is routine in America - especially in the GOP where people like Trump and Fiorina have built their candidacies on obvious lies.

8) America fetishises the individual. In the US, everyone is 'entitled to their opinion' while we tend to discern between 'good opinions and bad opinions' in the UK. We know implicitly that the BBC is a generally a truthful source of news in the UK, while all sources of the nearly 100% privately-owned media in the US are seen as being equally valid. This means that people on the right tend to get their news from idiot sources like theblaze, breitbart, talk radio or fox news and they're never forced to think critically about the news they consume or what they take away from it.

In some combination, these factors cultivate a non-culture of pig ignorant buffoons that ruin everything for everyone. I spent ages in the actual states thinking 'there must be something more to it than this' - but the reality of it was so unchallenging that it was almost challenging to come to terms with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Far Left

There is no far left in America. Even by the standards of Britain, which is one of the most right-wing countries in the west, politics seems crazyly right-wing. Obama is a conservative by the standard of most of the world (his team are coming out for David Cameron in the British elections next week). Warren is probably similar to conservative Angela Merkel in her political outlook. Sanders is just a run of the mill Social Democrat who would represent the main center-left party in most countries.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the parallel has more to do with Paul/Sanders supporters being hysterically detached from the real world. 

I'd love this guy to be president, but lets be clear about this: he's unelectable and the best he can do is push Hillary to the left. The problem with fringe political activists is that they believe that everyone is *really* on their side and that the media/government/corporations are to blame for creating some sort of false consciousness. Paulites had the Nolan chart, I can see /r/politics banding around statistics about how everyone believes what they believe. People don't think in rational terms, they can't be won over with reason alone. We've got a grey haired old man running here that doesn't have a typical backstory, inexperienced, Jewish (sorry but its true) from a precocious New England state. That's enough to put off the majority of Americans, Democratic Americans even who have a family and real responsibilities that 20-odd year old reddits can't understand -- they value stability and they're not overly political. The Democrats have nominated left-wing candidates before, look at Addle Stevenson, Michael Dukakis and they lost spectacularly. At the same time and under similar pretenses, Britain's Labour party nominated an actual Marxist called Michael Foot and he lost spectacularly. There was one-thousand times more excitement and ten times the appeal of Bobby Kennedy and he didn't even get the ticket!

If you want to talk about the media, its not that there's some government/corporate conspiracy against libertarians and social democrats its that Sanders is just not media friendly. The media are biased but only towards ratings - they love visceral sensationalism (look the the unworthy coverage rick perry/ted cruz gets!) paul/sanders just can't convey themselves in an exciting, ratings-grabbing manner. But the fact is that even if you had 90% of all political coverage dedicated to paul/sanders he'd still lose because most people don't really consume politics news and get their information from ads that Sanders will never ever be able to buy. 


Sorry that this is uncomfortable reading. This isn't a 'not with that attitude' thing, but so many people here are going to be analyzing every component of the entire campaign trail thinking he actually has a chance and then realize that they wasted a year of their life on this. I'm not saying don't try and I think its great what you're doing but be aware that this guy just won't win no matter what and that's not why he's in the race. </TEXT>

However, I don't think that personal security is the responsibility of children themselves. The pace of technology is so great that its impossible to be keep track of. There's no way you can blend into society without having social media in some capacity nowadays and all the pace at which detection technology is advancing just incredible. 

In 30 seconds I have know from your reddit account alone that you're a Scottish SNP supporter, you love football (arsenal), you play video games and especially the colin mcrae series. You probably work in the private sector, you're interested in world politics, scottish politics, european politics and british politics. I'm guess you're in your late 20s/early 30s.

Apart from Israel (which tends to vindicate stupid neocon ideas) we're the only major power that America listens to - we *could* for instance have actually hampered Iraq if Blair wasn't such a tool while the best France could do was to change the menu around at the white-house cafeteria. Other European countries even less so, Gerhard Schroder was vociferously against Iraq but America paid no attention. 

Sorry to go off topic and dig around a bit but this is what really confuses me about Scottish Nationalist Opinion. If we were to split the country in two and lose Trident then our place as the only sensible member of the UN P5 would be contested and America would probably just ignore everything the UN says and do whatever the fuck it wants *unilaterally*.

	<TEXT>  He also used public funds for a series of repairs to the picturesque cottage including the removal of wisteria from a chimney. For most of the past five years, Mr Cameron has claimed only for mortgage interest and utility bills on his designated second home.
But he deviated from his straightforward claiming habits in November 2006 when he billed the public purse 680 for repairs to the cottage, including clearing wisteria and vines from a chimney, replacing outside lights and resealing his conservatory roof. He repaid the claim last month. Though his claims are among the simplest of any senior political figure, he has faced criticism from Labour politicians for the large amounts of public money claimed for the mortgage on his constituency home.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/shadow-cabinet-expenses/5633166/David-Camerons-expenses.html

Yep money to repair his cottage - that's so worth the sleepless nights on the campaign trail, the constant pressure to make life or death decisions every day, the slaughtering from the media, the jeering from MPs, the hatred of the country. As a Labour voter you've just sealed my deal - totally viable that a man as capable, knowing and talented as David Cameron (don't tell me he's a moron, he gets grilled *every single week* on national television about the most obscure issues in random parts of the country) totally went for the job so he could claim expenses (which he then called to abolish).  </TEXT>

Right but Farage has gotten lots of coverage, especially on question time. Jean Claude Junker isn't pulling the BBC's strings. 

 They aren't above skewing peoples statements either. The BBC reported HSBC saying it was the prospect of the UK leaving the EU that was prompting it to consider moving when they said nothing of the sort.

Yes, human error. Way better than The Telegraph who had their news bought out to favour HSBC. 

  Their reasons were due to regulation and ringfencing.

Yep, it's reporting is terrible. The way it frames anything about Ed Miliband is bloody ridiculous. It has also publish several articles about how global warming don't real. 

 So people who just read the Mail don't have jobs or run businesses or have children or watch the news. They're retarded because you disagree with the newspaper that they read. Right.

No I'm talking about someone who just reads the Daily Mail. I want them to get on with their lives with an accurate view of the world. If they use the Daily Mail as their source of news they will be wrong about what's happening in the world. 

 Who decides this? You, Winston, with your little jar of tip-ex? 

It's pretty well established. As it stands, the Guardian website has more stories about something that did not happen at a university in america (UVA rape) than it does about something real and important and disturbing in our country (rotherham). There are plenty of other ways I could show it's biased as I could with any other obviously biased newspaper.  </TEXT>

It's factually wrong, there is no relativism when it comes to truth. If that's your main source of information, then yes you will be voting for the wrong reason. 

 Are they somehow lesser beings because they don't have the same opinions as you, they don't buy the same newspaper as you, because they don't vote the same way as you? 

Yes, I have a better world view than people who just read the Daily Mail. Not saying they're bad people, but their opinions are unsubstantiated. 

 What if I went around talking about the guardian's lies about zero hours contracts and food banks and stoking up class tension, and demanded their abolition on the basis that it persuaded people to vote left-wing?

Yep The Guardian has an obvious left wing bias and we should make it neutral along with all the other papers. 

 There is- let people make their own mind up and mind your own fucking business. 

That's exactly what I'm saying - people should be able to form their own opinion without being filtered through the warped perspective of about 5 or 6 media barons.

I'm not physically forcing anything, you can *choose* not to consume media if you want. My opinion is that everyone should be able to make their own minds up about things without being deceived. Barely Stalinistic. Under the current system people are beholden to the opinions of  5 or 6 millionaire media barons who don't think people should make up their own minds. 

 Do you not hold open the possibility that people who complain about BBC bias and who object to state control of the press may have a point, and that this conflict is best resolved by allowing people to make their own minds up, and allowed to produce or purchase such journalism that they see fit?

I've encountered a lot of those sorts and none have so far provided any evidence to substantiate their claims, so no I don't think they have a point. 

 Allow people to make their own minds up, and allowed to produce or purchase such journalism that they see fit

That's literally what I'm suggesting. Journalism is sacristan, I don't want it colonized, cheapened, americanized by market forces -- it's the fourth estate, the aim of all journalists should be to report *news*, not to sell papers. </TEXT>

If he wanted the status, he could retire right now and be remembered as a Labour grandee alongside Robin Cooke, John Smith, Tony Benn, Barbra Castle etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Have you people learned nothing from past likeable leaders

He's the polar opposite of Blair. Major? I'd have a drink with him, victim of circumstance really - i'd rate him as a tory leader. Thatcher? She was anything but likable and used that fact to her advantage - [she was as cold as you would have thought in her personal life](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/lord-bell-christmas-with-margaret-thatcher-was-horrible-and-trying-presents-games-and-children-were-banned-9942468.html.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where has he ever contradicted himself over policy? I actually think he's pretty good at arguing over anything and telling people why he think they're wrong. If this did get picked up it would be all over conservative broadcasts like Mitt Romney's flipflops were all over Obama's. </TEXT>
