	<TEXT> Unless I'm reading this wrong, the 11th district is saying that Gender nonconforming is actionable cause in discrimination cases but sexual orientation is not? 

Also I'm baffled by what a female security guard outfit would be. (listed as one of her non conforming pieces of clothing)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's why I think it's more of a morality opposition for people. Both Posner and Easterbrook are conservative leaning, and Posner goes out of his way to show that interpretation is not activism because it takes decades to update meanings of the text.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I see happening  is that people who have a moral opposition to homosexuality are going to cry "judicial activism" in order to suggest that all laws are a) meant to be upheld despite their constitutionality/unconstitutionality because the legislature has never been fallible and should self correct and b) original intent excludes interpretation from the decision. 

To the second point I'd like to implore people to read Circuit Judge Posner's first 4 paragraphs on page 24 of the actual [decision](http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display Path=Y2017/D04-04/C:15-1720:J:Wood:aut:T:fnOp:N:1942256:S:0)

	<TEXT> The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. 

Also means the above, the 9th amendment, is a contradiction in a contradiction. How does anyone reconcile the fact that Constitution literally contains an ambiguous statement that there are things not in the Constitution still protected/available to the citizenry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I downvoted you because judicial activism is hyperbole to prevent judges from doing their job. Judges do not assess moral or immoral dilemmas, they determine whether or not a law is constitutional or unconstitutional within the scope of the text presented AND modern interpretations and applications of that text. The conservative leaning justice in this decision gave a reasonable argument that not only speaks to the Civil Rights Act but also provides multiple other lines of reasoning. 

I personally hate that Trump is president because it will be easier to gloss over Obama's faults because of Trump's incompetence. Trump is making Obama look better than he should look.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nobody is entitled to a job but you should have the same entitlement to a job as someone of equal qualifications. Hence when the system (and the free market) continue to exacerbate socioeconomic difference based off x, y, z protected characteristic, then it's discriminatory behavior, and we expect our government to protect us equally from said behavior. 

Your example is weird because I imagine it would depend on the scope, so first of all she can not hire whomever she wants as long as it doesn't appear to be a pattern. And no lawyer would ever be able to prove that eye color was part of a pattern of discrimination. And then she was raped by an individual so she's allowed her prejudice? We protect her sensibilities towards non-actors because why? In the case where she was in a position to practice discriminatory hiring practices, I would imagine she should just seek mental health counseling to deal with her issues.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a bad example because the law you're selecting is so narrow. I would compare it to how early supreme court cases excluded women from getting the right to vote because the 15th amendment only culturally referred to liberated slaves.

The crowd is fun and raucous without being unruly. It's short season so this might be the reason but they seem more like excuses for group outings than cheer your favorite player.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently discovered [Pankaj Mishra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Mishra) who I've been diving into. He provides a non-western overview of the west. Most recently he published a book called Age of Anger about the rise of nationalism/populism in Europe and America. 

I would also recommend Eduardo Galeano's Las Venas Abiertas de Latina America. He's a fiction writer primarily, but came up as a journalist and all of his works focus around a rewriting of American history that decentralizes it from the United States. Hugo Chavez famously gave this book to Obama stating something to the effect of "if you want to understand Latin America, you have to read this" 

Edit: I'm going to also plug a professor I had in college [Andrew Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ross_(sociologist\)) He focuses more on the global cost of labor, but he's an extremely passionate and smart dude. His most recent books discusses defaulting on debt. He also was fairly instrumental in Occupy Wall Street, and was denied entry to the UAE because he was trying to expose bad labor practices.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ~~I assumed the first blob was Sonny Gray, who I know is injured but he's the only possible option for second best in the AL West.~~ Misread your point. This is saying the #2 and #3 pitchers are relatively equal, hence  the bigger blob. and then the #4 is the big gap.  I'm not suggesting the A's rotation is bad, just questioning whether they're better than Cole Hamels, Shoemaker, Keuchel, and Felix Hernandez. Which I don't think they are. Especially when Cotton, Alcantara, and Triggs are in their first full season right? 

Also I knew I was going to screw up Manaea's name. I even had a tab open with a search for him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> obviously just dots on the line graph there but I assume that Graverman and Manea are the slightly bigger blob. This graph puts them slightly behind Keuchel and Shoemaker, and ahead of every single other pitcher in the West. The A's are obviously not garbage and I'm not suggesting they can't have the best rotation, but comparing to all other divisions they're the only one predicted to finish near the bottom of the division but with best rotation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prospect Park would probably be the easiest run for you in terms of not having to worry about crowds. Plus it's a beautiful park with some challenging slopes
Brooklyn Bridge is a fun run but there's no promise you won't be starting and stopping with the amount of people walking over it. The actual bridge span is only 1 km (.6 mi), if you include the ramps to get on off, you might get to a mile, maybe. </TEXT>

Show me the research for same sex education because what I've seen shows that girls do better in integrated classrooms but boys do worse but both of them suffer from segregation. 

Also the discrimination is what contributes to continued inequality of population in terms of representation. I didn't get into every single school I applied to, for whatever reason. Nor was I given a justification. Whites aren't owed a justification when they are knowingly applying to a field and school that they are over-represented in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure what you're saying. OP's statement was using percentage of groups that presented with the same test grades and scores. Where this obfuscates actual number of accepted students. Surprisingly that's still extremely low for Black and Latino applicants. Hence the compelling need to accept a hire proportion of students with the exact same test grades and gpa as their peers. 

Affirmative action is not allowed in admission practices but diversity is a compelling interest. And yeah studies have increasingly shown that a diverse student body promotes a greater diversity of ideas, and elevates grades. etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure okay I get that on Jim Crow, but they didn't just spring up from a small collective of individuals going against trends. They had support by the electorate, and were enforced by individuals. I'm not sure how you conclude that this faceless entity of the government was the evil in that situation. 

People at the time didn't think it was reprehensible. Abraham Lincoln wasn't even sure if the Emancipation Proclamation was a legitimate use of government power. Much like people disagree on abortion, and people disagree on refugees. Each side will attempt to argue it. So my question again is, do Republicans believe it will work itself out organically?

	<TEXT> This is such a great nuanced answer that I appreciate but I'm struggling with understanding what Arlie Russell Hochschild calls "The Great Paradox" in reference to deregulation and less government intervention. Jim Crow also refers to the general attitude of discrimination that existed in the South right? Ie shop owners discriminating based off race, bus requirements, water fountains, schools etc. Is the Republican principle that it works itself out organically? Slash how does limited government respond to great moral issues like slavery? And most recently Hochschild talks about the environmental degradation in Southern states due to corporate overreach and the inability of the government to sanction or regulate. Do you agree that industry will regulate itself because it doesn't want BP oil spill like situations to occur? How does that respond to corporations that are only interested in the bottom line and will cut corners and skirt safety regulations to maximize profit?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I searched for DNC Mission statement and got this page here:

https://www.democrats.org/about/our-party

Which pretty much just says that everyone should get a fair shot regardless of x, y, z. Bit vague in my opinion, but I guess a mission statement isn't a place to get overly specific. ([this](http://www.christianpost.com/news/god-absent-from-democratic-conventions-mission-statement-81095/) is the second hit when you search DNC Mission statement, which is funny/great) 

Here is the RNC version: https://gop.com/platform/preamble/

So much longer and fleshed out here. There's more of an emphasis on government ("We believe the Constitution was written not as a flexible document, but as our enduring covenant." ie individualism and interpretation are not allowed here, laws should be rigid and enforced etc), some references to the general strong military lean ("As Americans and as Republicans we wish for peace  so we insist on strength. ") and references to a shared but exclusive culture and us vs them rhetoric ("They refuse to control our borders but try to control our schools, farms, businesses, and even our religious institutions."   "Every time we sing, God Bless America, we are asking for help.")

The parties also put out their platforms ahead of the RNC/DNC so those would be good places to look

Edit: Linking the preamble for the DNC to be fair https://www.democrats.org/party-platform#preamble

I find the actual construction of the two documents interesting. The RNC seems to be going for the old school mantra building (We believe, we believe, ad infinitum) whereas the DNC just straight up wrote an essay.

	<TEXT> I went into this fairly apprehensive. I read and loved White Teeth, but then completely zoned out through On Beauty. 

While I did end up liking the story, for the first half of the book I kept asking myself "why is this happening now? what is the purpose in me reading about this person's life in such detail?" This was mostly resolved by the end but I feel that Zadie sometimes offers up too much detail. 

Do others think she was successful in exploring the dichotomy between discussing and studying black bodies in space/motion versus attempting to make a life out of it? (which seemed to be at least the alluded to theme with the narrator and Tracey.)

What was up with the weird Lamin, Ferm, narrator, and Aimee romance? 

How do others feel about the ending?
