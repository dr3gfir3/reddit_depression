	<TEXT> I have a cousin who just came out herself. I'm so glad she did as everyone already assumed for the longest time that she and her female "friend" were an item. 

I think it would've gone out smoother with her parents if she told them one completely unrelated news (like you did) when she announced that she was gay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fish knew what he was doing. Knew it was wrong. He wasn't insane in the sense that it can be used for his defense. He was malicious, evil, and perverted. The form of justice that we have right now, he does not deserve - this crime deserves a measure of revenge along with justice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a book about this guy. Tells the story from his childhood, etc. He was abused, but he was always such a perv and a sick fuck. One of things that stuck in my head was Fish using a rose-stem, inserting it in his penis... </TEXT>
