	<TEXT> My boyfriend used to be sort of similar. If I told him I wasn't going to come over after work, he'd ask why, and my saying "I just need some me time" would freak him out and he'd start thinking I don't enjoy his company or something. Eventually he got it. The thing is that some people honestly don't need "me time." Of course to people like us that seems bizarre, but to them it seems bizarre that we wouldn't want to spend our free time with someone. 


Best thing in my opinion is to be straight up with her. Explain to her that you need time to yourself to unwind and it certainly has nothing to do with her. Explain to her, nicely, that getting some time to yourself will make you more able to enjoy the time you do have with her.  </TEXT>
