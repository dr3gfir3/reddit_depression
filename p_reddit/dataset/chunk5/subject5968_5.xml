	<TEXT> he addressed that in part 1. He talked about never wanting to feel afraid or uncomfortable in the woods alone, since that's literally his bread and butter. Humans are *insanely* good at rationalizing things that cannot or do not need to be rationalized, purely for the sake of burying their head in the sand in order to continue their daily affairs. 

It's not the most attractive quality, but it's the reason why obese people can't put the cheeseburger down, and why my Dad never believed me when I smelled the transmission in our truck was about to explode and when I smelled burning timber and insulation and discovered our attic was on fire.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> speaking from a super basic standpoint, the stock F-14A and the Chopper A really only differ in their maximum part slots. At level 1 the Chopper tomcat already has more available part slots than my level 13 Stock tomcat. 

Now that I've scored one of the wardog squad planes, I'm basically content with whatever rank I'm going to get from about 1-2 hours of play per day. 

If they had made this a Razgriz event...I'd probably have dumped some serious $ and time into making sure I stayed in the top ranks. 
They should have done Razgriz skin drops or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Arkansas is one big fucking pine forest so here I've only ever seen them leading up to big, old growth pines. 

In Texas I've seen both oak and pine about equally as much.

My uncle in Canton, TX has quite a few instances of these "steps to nowhere" but insists they were probably coupled to an old deer hunting tree stand or feeder of some sort. He's a pretty down to earth guy so I've always believed him on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Night nav, at least on the Army side, is almost idiot-proof. Unless you're at Ranger school or something similarly challenging, the instructors tend to simplify the courses as much as possible. (i.e. points lined up in long, straight lines along a power line clearing, points less than 200m apart from one another, etc.)

I've done night nav at three different posts thus far (Ft. Jackson, McClellan, Robinson) and Mac was the hardest; Insane terrain obstacles and undergrowth that easily hasn't been cleared/burned in 100+ years. 

I've never personally seen all the monsters and shit that people say they've encountered, but I'm a firm believer in the human ability to perceive whether we're being watched or threatened, without ever actually coming in contact with the threatening/observing entity. 

100% of these stories mention an uncanny "feeling of being watched" and you'll hear that in pretty much any recounting of a dangerous situation, paranormal or otherwise. If anything, humans are *really* good at knowing when something/someone is tracking on us; never discount that prickly feeling on the back of your neck as anything other than your body saying "hey, watch the fuck out, something's trying to eat us." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People die at the Ft. Rucker SERE course all the time. 
If you did your SERE in Alabama, I can absolutely vouch for you that there is strange shit in those woods.

There are patches of undergrowth so deep and dark that when you look into them, it's like looking into a void. My night land nav course at Ft. McClellan took me through an area of undergrowth that was so thick and dark I was sure I would never make it through. 

I decided it would be best to try and crawl under it to get to my next grid point, but I only got about 10 feet when I became distinctly aware that there was something in the thicket with me. I have no idea what it was, but I know something was watching me, probably waiting for me to get snagged so it could make its move. 

I backed out of the bramble and "boxed out" the obstacle and got back on course to my next point. I only needed to find 3 out of the 5 given points to pass the course, and once I got to that third point, you bet your ass I hauled it back to the start/finish as fast as I could.

There's shit out there in the dark that we don't know about, and that we don't need to go looking for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yes. I know exactly what you're talking about. You'll find wooden/stone steps leading up to tree trunks in many places across the southern United States. 

I've never personally run across a full-blown staircase in the middle of the forest, but I definitely *have* seen what you're calling "devil's pulpits". I was not aware the lore behind them, nor that they even had a name, but I can't even begin to recall how many of them I've seen throughout the woods in Texas and Arkansas. Super common occurrence down here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it bugs the shit out of me that things that we believe can't/shouldn't have a consciousness actually *might*. Whether that's because they're "something else" disguising themselves as stairs in the woods, a painting that really does seem to be looking back at you, or somehow it's memories and feelings trapped inside inanimate objects, it *really* bothers me.  </TEXT>
