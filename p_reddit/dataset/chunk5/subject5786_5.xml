Also, T_D has that as their *default* prediction.  There's not much credit due when an idea you hold uncritically turns out to be true.

	<TEXT> GOP has control of the House and Senate and now cannot pass a bill to repeal parts of the ACA even though they have at least 62 times before.  The House must have just been wasting time and sending political messages to the WH over the past 7 years and never really meant to repeal or even *gasp* repair it.  Sad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check out this article: http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/12/14240364/trump-buzzfeed-dossier-treason-law

Or a summary of the article (I'll put their closing disclaimer at the beginning for emphasis):

 To say it is premature to speculate on indictments is a vast understatement, Hennessey says. We just dont know what, if anything, has actually happened; much less what the government might be able to prove in court.
 
 Even before we know for sure what actually happened, however, we do know at least one thing: It wasnt treason. Thats a specific crime, with a specific definition, and theres no way the behavior of Trump and his aides qualifies.

Espionage Act

 The Espionage Act is commonly used to prosecute leakers, and bans the conveyance of information meant to interfere with the operation of the US armed forces or promote the success of America's enemies.
  
 While a lot depends on the specifics, the report published in BuzzFeed alleges that Donald Trump and his associates "obtained and supplied the Kremlin" with information on "leading Russian oligarchs and their families" living in the US. If that inflammatory charge proves true, one could imagine it qualifying as an Espionage Act violation.

Foreign Agents Registration Act

 [A]nother potential vulnerability comes from the Foreign Agents Registration Act; the law could come into play if the government concludes that Trump and/or his aides effectively acted as Russian agents without disclosing the connection.

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

 [T]he Computer Fraud and Abuse Act could also form a potential basis for a prosecution against Trump aides who the report alleges knew about and collaborated with the Russian government on anti-Democratic hacking operations.

Also Logan Act but..

 Many legal observers dont take the Logan Act particularly seriously, however, given that it seems to rather clearly violate the First Amendment and would stand a good chance of being struck down should it even actually lead to a prosecution, according to Goldsmith and other legal observers like UT Austins Steve Vladeck.

EDIT: Article could use more detail, I admit, but it's a good start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  According to internal emails released by the agency late on Wednesday, the order went out by email minutes after 5pm on Inauguration Day, and came from Larry Gillick, whose LinkedIn profile identifies him as Acting Director of Digital Strategy at the Department of Interior.  
 
 Gillick wrote that the new administration was not jazzed by two unwise and unflattering tweets from the National Parks Service Twitter account that day. One of those was a re-tweet of New York Times journalist Binyamin Appelbaum, in which he compared the sizes of crowds assembled for inaugurations in 2009 and 2017.

Anyways, if the Trump campaign's communications were caught up incidentally in surveillance from a FISA legal warrant, that means he or someone in his campaign was communicating directly or indirectly with the target of an active counterintelligence operation.  Would you say that a good thing for Trump, or a bad thing for Trump? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, this report is a big fucking deal and is not good for Manafort.  Not good at all.  And this is on top of the other reports about Manafort's adventures that just came out yesterday. 

 President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics, The Associated Press has learned. The work appears to contradict assertions by the Trump administration and Manafort himself that he never worked for Russian interests.

 ...

 "We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success," Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, "will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government."

	<TEXT> Yep.  That's why I posted it here yesterday but it didn't get much play as the noise of the Russian hearing drowned it out and it's very circumstantial.  

It may be nothing but it's still reasonable to be suspicious about it especially because Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Bank of America (and 2 others) all got hit with fines and criminal penalties as a result of this case, but yet Trump's bank gets away scot-free... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Allow me to help you out.  

From this blog:

 Mr. Comey made clear there has been ZERO evidence of collusion between the Russian government and the then-Trump campaign.

From the hearing:

 HIMES: So, you used the word coordination which to me suggests that you are in fact investigating whether there was coordination between U.S. persons and the Russians. Is it fair for me to assume that we shouldn't simply dismiss the possibility that there was coordination or collusion between the Russian efforts and U.S. persons as an investigatory body?
  
 COMEY: Well all I can tell you is what **we're investigating which includes whether there was any coordination between people associated with the Trump campaign and the Russians**.

And earlier:

 STEWART: ... Mr. Clapper, the former DNI, and we all know who he is, this is someone who should know. I want to read what he said just a few weeks ago. Mr. Clapper then went on to say that to his knowledge there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. We did not conclude any evidence in our report and when I say "our report," that is the NSA, FBI, and CIA with my office, the director of national intelligence said anything -- any reflection of collusion between the members of Trump campaign and the Russians, there was no evidence of that in our report.

 Was Mr. Clapper wrong when he said that?

 COMEY: I think he's right **about characterizing the report** which you all have read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Main points below, article has further background info but not much.  Is it normal to discover a major investigation is closed in this manner and this late?  I should probably look it up.  

EDIT: Looks like whether or not to even notify [targets of prosecution](http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/uploads/sites/1/DeclinationsBooklet.pdf) that they are no longer being investigated is discretionary, and the [US Attorney manual] (https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-2000-authority-us-attorney-criminal-division-mattersprior-approvals#9-2.050) doesn't say much about publicly disclosing, just filing a written notice in 'cases of considerable public interest'


 Deutsche Bank, the Trump Organization's largest creditor, said Monday that the Justice Department recently closed a criminal investigation into possible currency manipulation.  
  
 President Donald Trump's Attorney General Jeff Sessions took office on Feb. 9.  
  
**The Justice Department notified the German bank in a letter Feb. 13 that it was closing the investigation, Deutsche Bank said Monday in a public filing.**
 
 In October, near the end of the Obama administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission dropped its own investigation into Deutsche Bank and currency manipulation.
 
 Deutsche Bank has drawn special scrutiny in recent months because of its ties to Trump, which include billions of dollars of loans since the 1990s. Many of the loans have been paid off but four remain unpaid -- on properties in Miami, Chicago and Washington, D.C.  
  
 The four loans were worth a total of $364 million when they were made, between 2012 and 2015, and are now worth roughly $300 million, according to an estimate by Bloomberg.  
  
 The Justice Department would not comment on its decision to close the investigation. Deutsche Bank did not return an email seeking comment.

 ...  
  
 In the Justice Department's currency-manipulation investigation, five major banks pleaded guilty in 2015 and paid a total of $2.5 billion in criminal penalties to settle charges that they manipulated the prices of dollars and euros in the foreign-currency exchange. The banks included Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America.  
  
  Deutsche Bank said in its filing Monday that other "regulatory and law-enforcement agencies" around the world are probing currency trading and that is it "cooperating with these investigations." The bank did not specify which agencies are investigating but said the probes could result in "significant financial penalties." </TEXT>
