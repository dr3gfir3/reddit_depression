	<TEXT> At the Olympic level, they call for two years IIRC, with continuous testing. But that's a max time case; for people who have been building muscle for years and who have massive incentive to cheat the system by skirting some treatments, and with quite a large margin for error.

For someone who has been on hormones for a significant portion of their life, the bar is lower because there just hasn't been time for muscle mass to develop. Plus, Safe Harbor has long been a policy in most sporting leagues where competitors who have a medical need for something that is normally banned undergo testing to ensure that they aren't cheating; the issue of controlled substances and medicine in sports is one that's been pretty well established already because there are many medical conditions that fall under that umbrella.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a college student, so she hasn't had decades of muscle mass development. Even if she had, it takes two years of hormones within a normal female range to eliminate any advantage that gave her (mind you that's a conservative estimate the IOC made for people who trained their whole lives; in actual fact it can be much quicker).

As for bone structure, that depends on her treatment; if she was on puberty blockers and later hormones from a fairly young age, that wouldn't have developed like a man. And while there have been no long-term studies that I know of confirming this, because the skeleton is constantly being broken down and regenerated like pretty much every other part of the body, I suspect that after enough time even bones would be changed by hormone replacement. </TEXT>

[From the author of that study](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2014/09/10/puberty-suppression-benefits-gender-questioning-teens-study):

"Since **puberty suppression is a fully reversible medical intervention**, it provides adolescents and their families with time to explore their gender dysphoric feelings, and [to] make a more definite decision regarding the first steps of actual gender reassignment treatment at a later age," said study lead author Dr. Annelou de Vries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Using hormones on children is not standard practice; that's why hormone blockers are used instead. Blockers merely prevent the body from processing certain hormones, which is far safer and easier to reverse than hormone replacement; they can be used to prevent puberty from starting at around 8 or 9 years with very little risk. While there is some debate over long-term effects this treatment can have in very young people, current medical consensus is that they are the best treatment available today. </TEXT>

Worth mentioning is that due to the small sample size, this shouldn't be taken as a representative result; it's possible this is an outlier case.

As for the brain development, a trans person's brain is physically like that of the sex of the gender they identify as. So far as I know nobody has figured out why, but body just doesn't line up with the brain sometimes.

	<TEXT> DNA is not the sole determining factor in biological sex. In fact it's the one least often used to make a determination. There are physical characteristics that are used to make that determination as well, and they don't always point to the same conclusion.

The brain of a trans person is physically not the same. They reflect structures like those in the brains of the sex of the gender they identify as. That's not a mental disability, that's physical.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The rules aren't bent for her any more than they are for anyone else. Safe harbor is pretty common; it means if you have some condition that requires hormone treatment (which is something that cisgender people have too), so long as you're tested to ensure that you don't exceed certain benchmarks you're eligible.

As for the second point; it's true. Muscle mass is very much dependent on hormones, and HRT demolishes muscle mass. Really the only thing that doesn't change is her skeleton, and if she's been on puberty blockers/hormones from an early age (which I don't know, doesn't seem to be the case here from what I read) even her skeleton would be substantially different from how it would have been without intervention. </TEXT>
