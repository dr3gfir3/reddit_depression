	<TEXT> Have you reviewed Amazon's "review guidelines"? I'm curious if your review was indeed in conflict with Amazon's policy? 

I know this is irrelevant to your point but you should protest against Amazon for rejecting your review.  

If your goal is to see this policy revised, then push to make that happen. I would argue that one of the first steps of making this change would be to be sure that review remains on Amazon's marketplace. 

Good luck,
