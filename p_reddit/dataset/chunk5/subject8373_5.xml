	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I have a 2008 Mazda 3 S GT and I just got the code P0128 (low engine coolant temp) on my way home from work.  After reading online, many people said it is a stuck open thermostat.  However, I just replaced my thermostat two months ago with a part from O'Reillys.  

I also did did a test tonight to see how quickly my coolant temperature rose.  Starting with a cold engine, the gauge went up to the middle within 3 minutes, and my sensor app showed that my coolant temp hit 100C in about 6 minutes.  This seems fairly normal to me.  I cleared the code since then and am going to wait and see if the code returns.  

What could the problem be?  Stuck open thermostat like everyone says?  Has anybody else ran into this problem?  

Any comments/help is appreciated!

Edit: Also changed the coolant temperature sensor two months ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just put some Michelin Primacy MXM4s on my 08 in December. I also live in Southern CA.  Not sure if they're on sale still, but I got them for about $100 a tire. I was leaning towards the Conti DWS like everyone recommends, but decided on the MXM4s because they're cheaper and still have good performance.  

With that being said, the ride is a lot smoother and quieter than the Toyo Proxes 4s that were on my car previously.  Grip is great and gave me tons of confidence driving in the rain. Haven't driven them in any snow yet. 

Like the other comments mentioned, do a ton of research on tire rack and see if any reliable shops around your area will pricematch them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't notice if it was displaying those or not. I'll check tomorrow morning, but I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't showing up.   I haven't driven it at all since that happened. I was to afraid of causing more damage. 

Thanks for the advice. Good to know if I do end up replacing the TCM. (Which seems likely) </TEXT>

Would an auto parts store like autozone/Napa/oreilly's have a trans code reader? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started my 08 Mazda 3 S GT a couple hours after my four hour drive home for the holidays and these three lights came on: AT, check engine, and traction control. My car was driving perfectly fine before this. When I shift from park to reverse, my car jerks back and forth pretty badly. I checked my transmission fluid, and everything seems fine. Level is okay and is only slightly brown, doesn't smell burnt.
I plugged in a code reader, and it's giving me U0101 Error Communication TCM. Does this mean I'm due for a new TCM?
Has anyone else experienced this problem and replaced it yourself? If so, what guide did you use? I've been looking all over and I can't seem to find any. Any help is appreciated </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thermostat was just replaced last weekend. It didn't fix my overheating problem, and the mechanic that checked out my car said it was functioning when he was trying to diagnose it.

I'm hoping it's just an air bubble from when I replaced the coolant temperature sensor. But we'll see.  I'll update tonight when I try and burp it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I just fixed an overheating problem on my 2008 Mazda 3 by replacing my coolant temperature sensor.  Before that, I also replaced my thermostat and a cracked coolant reservoir.  Now that the overheating problem is gone, my heater only blows cold. Would could possibly cause this?  

I did notice that the top left little reservoir hose on my coolant reservoir tank is dripping a tiny bit.  Would this affect my heater? I thought the little hoses are just for overflow. 

Also, when I turn the fans all the way up and at a cold temperature, it blows out hard.  Once I turn the temperature up, the air gets a lot weaker.  And not any warmer. 

I'm going to try burping the system tonight after work and I'll post an update.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you have any tips? I'm planning on following these instructions:

A. Start the engine and idle it until the water temp indicator is in the center when the engine is below 1500rpm.
B. Bleed the air from the cooling system by using the procedures below. At this time, monitor the coolant temp to prevent overheating.
 Run the engine at 2500rpm for 2-3 minutes, 2 times. 
 Run the engine at 3000rpm for 5 seconds, then idle.
 Repeat steps above twice.
C. Stop engine and inspect coolant level after the coolant cools down.

I'll post an update tonight! </TEXT>

**Update 1:** I haven't burped the system yet because the heat started working again later that day. Has been working great for the last two days. Is burping still necessary? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this same problem.  In the morning or after my 08 MZ3 S GT had been sitting for a long time (5+ hours), it would stall out and almost die right after starting up unless I gave it a little gas.  It would idle really rough, with the rpms jumping between 1.5k and 500. After giving it a little gas, it would sit at around 2k rpms and be fine.  How long does it idle really rough before it runs smoothly? The problem turned out to be my coolant temperature sensor.  I bought the part at O'reilly's for about $28band replaced it myself. All you need is a 19mm deep socket and about 10-20 minutes.  Look up the symptoms of a bad coolant temp sensor, it sounds pretty similar to what you described.  PM me you have any questions!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My left rear wheel is obviously more negatively cambered than my right rear wheel.  After getting an alignment and learning that the rear isn't adjustable, they recommended either installing camber control arms or taking it to a body shop to see if anything is bent.  

Does one wheel being off necessarily mean something is bent?  The car has never been in any accidents, struts were replaced about 10k miles ago.

	<TEXT> I'm buying new tires for my 2008 Mazda 3 S GT. I know the Continental DWS are one of the most recommended tires, but I got a really good deal on the Michelin MXM4's. ($85 a tire, $605 out the door with alignment plus a $70 rebate = $533.) 

Does anyone have experience with the MXM4's?  How do you like them? How are they wearing?

My car was at normal operating temp by the time I got one, but as I accelerated to get up to 65-70 mph, it started to overheat.  My gauge went from about halfway to around 3/4.  I left off the gas, and it stopped climbing.  I hit the gas a little bit again, and it started to climb so I let off.  Then it started to fall back to the normal operating temperature.  Keep in mind that this all happened in a span of about 20 seconds.   </TEXT>

It's just when I accelerate/slow down repeatedly the temp will climb all the way up and then slowly come back down. Sometimes it will only peak for a second and sometimes it stays there for about 30 seconds.  </TEXT>
