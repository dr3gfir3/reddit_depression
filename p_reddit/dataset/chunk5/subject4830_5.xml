	<TEXT> I missed the "my girls" comment on my first read through the article. I kept expecting his advocating for celibacy as wanting his children to become Priests. Maybe Nuns in this case, but he doesn't mention wanting his children to join a religious order.

I also wondered if by celibacy he meant, just have sex a few times once you get married, to have children, but he clearly states he doesn't want grandchildren.

With all the parental celebacy pressure I expect his daughters to be regular contributors to /r/excatholic once they get old enough to realize their father is nuts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, the situation sounds even worse than I thought.

Trump will be able to take the "blame the previous Administration" route for a little while. Soon enough he will run into problems that won't be so easily explained away, and can't be solved with a 3am Tweet. That's when this shit show will get really interesting.

What should also be interesting is to see how members of Congress and foreign leaders try to use Trump's personality weaknesses against Trump. It shouldn't be too hard to back Trump into a corner.

Edit: a few more thoughts. Reading this article and can see some of the aspects voters liked in Trump. As a reality TV star he could fire people each week and treat people like shit. That is entertaining for people. As a business man who would cheat his investors, bankrupt businesses, while getting rich himself, I guess some people could admire that. Similar with his sexiest pig personality.

The thing all these pieces of Trump's past have in common is: they don't impact the lives of most Americans, other than providing a perverse form of entertainment. All of that changes at noon on Friday. He is going to find the people he previously entertained getting really pissed at him as soon as they start blaming the Trump administration for whatever problems they have in their lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why would anyone expect something different? American politics is so polarized. Roughly 50% of America will dislike President Trump. Since President Elect Trump is going out of his way to be an extra special asshole, his approval numbers are even lower.

All of this will hurt his businesses. Maybe he can leverage his Presidency to help with his current business debt, but if he keeps up his jerky behavior his businesses will still lose customers.

Prior to the election, I already thought Trump was an asshole, but didn't care that much. Now, I will go out of my way to not spend money on any Trump owned business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We could make the distinction between responsible and irresponsible behavior, when pregnant. Irresponsible behavior would cover chemical endangerment. A person who is honest and says they are unable to care for their child and seeks the help from the state, that is responsible behavior.

I am bothered by the punishment aspect of the "pro life" community. The general "if you didn't want to get pregnant then you shouldn't have sex" argument, or "only have sex and get pregnant if you are married and can take care of a baby". With all the health benefits of human sexuality beyond reproduction, it's ridiculous to put such tight restrictions and punishment around sex. </TEXT>

Wow, now that is a fascinating new way (for me) to look at protecting a woman's rights.

Parent's can surrender rights to their children, to the state. That happens for a variety of reasons, often because they can't take care of the child. Maybe fill out the paperwork to surrender your parental rights to this one second old person, and then force the state to either (pay for your medical care or provide an abortion). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can sympathize with your story. I too struggled with having sexual relationships even after becoming "ex Catholic". After a while, I realized I was mostly going out of my way to avoid relationships, that I was lonely, and that I really didn't know how to fix my situation. It was a dark time. I felt really stuck.

Therapy was the key for me. I found a local therapist and spent a long while on the couch. My therapist followed the CBT "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy" approach. Slowly I started to see how I kept getting into the same situations and started to understand the thought patterns behind it. There was plenty of it tied into my Catholic upbringing, guilt, shame, anger. It took some time to unravel all of it, but I can honestly say therapy was the best thing I've ever done for myself.

	<TEXT>  If you are White and you pride yourself in your heritage, culture, religion, or ancestry suddenly you're a racist.

That's not entirely true. It depends on how people celebrate those ideas.

People who are of Irish descent celebrate St. Patricks Day and aren't generally thought of a racist. Similar for Italian Americas, and probably people of any European descent who want to celebrate their particular background or culture. There are plenty of religious/cultural celebrations throughout the year. There are days in memory of various saints, or just food and culture festivals. None of these are generally considered racist.

I'm a white guy, but have also never felt comfortable with the idea of "white pride". I don't really know what that means, in the general sense of being white. I have Irish ancestors and do some basic St. Patricks Day recognition. In America, we have national holidays, the 4th of July and Thanksgiving being two popular ones. They aren't specifically white, but pride in our ancestors is widely celebrated, and most of the key historical figures those holidays are based on, were white.

What are ways people could celebrate pride in being white, without the general racist overtones? I genuinely struggle with how to answer this question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Republicans have found themselves in a difficult spot, they didn't really expect to be in, with Trump winning and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed, they have been trying to repeal it. Once Republicans took over the House, but President Obama was still President, House Republicans staged dozens of votes, passing a repeal of the Affordable Care Act that they knew had a 0% chance of getting signed by President Obama. It was just good old-fashioned political theater, and throwing a bone to their conservative base.

Now that Republicans can actually repeal and replace, or just repeal and walk away, they have found themselves in the unenviable position of having to try to fix and system that really can't be fixed, at least by anything remotely acceptable to Republicans.

They made a mistake calling it "Obamacare", making it immediately disliked by conservatives. Whatever gets created next will be called "Trumpcare" or something silly like that, and Republicans will get the blame every time someone can't afford healthcare under that new system. [Reviews of existing Republican health care plans](http://www.vox.com/2016/11/17/13626438/obamacare-replacement-plans-comparison) show that they will cause more people to lose insurance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All this Putin loving is bound to be a problem for Trump at some point. Either when enough details come out about Russia's involvement in the our election, or just the eventual conflict of interest between Russia and the US. Trump just keeps doubling down on how Putin and Russia are awesome and can do no wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The part I'm confused by is: do Republicans really want to repeal Obamacare, replace it with Trump/Ryan Care, or whatever moniker it gets, and then Republicans get all the grief when things go wrong? Much like privitizing Social Security, or the general dislike of Social Security by conservatives. That's been an issue for them since FDR. It gets their base excited. Once they privitize or overhaul something, it's the old "you break it, you bought it".

	<TEXT> There are a few factors that contribute to Syria being more visible to Americans

* Russia and Iran are helping Assad
* President Obama's red line comments early in the Syrian conflict, but not following through on enforcing it
* Conflict in Syria related to Arab Spring
* ISIS being a part of the conflict. The complex issues around who is fighting who, and the potential outcomes (all of them bad) depending on who ultimately wins
