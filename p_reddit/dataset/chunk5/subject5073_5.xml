	<TEXT> Currently stuck in traffic. :( I can imagine how much time is wasted in traffic, how many people show up late to work, and how much stress this causes. Is there a systematic way we can quantify the effects of really bad traffic jams? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Despite their iconic shape and ridiculous size, Star Destroyers have never been shown off to their true potential in the movies. The stories might not call for them, but I'm sure a Star Destroyer hovering above a city would be terrifying. If Darth Malak's Dreadnaught can do what it does in KOTOR, Star Destroyers flying around could definitely show how oppressive the Empire can be. 

* Episode III - Venators fight some of the CIS ships, but the SDs are just backdrops
* Episode IV - the most a SD ever does is catch up to Tantive IV
* Episode V - the SDs at Hoth let everyone escape, and they get ion cannon'd... the Millennium Falcon just hangs out behind one and escapes
* Episode VI - Palpy just wants them to hang out at Endor for "the trap"
* Episode VII - dead on Jakku

I hope we see them actually do stuff in Rogue One. They've never done anything to live up to their name (I guess the Death Stars didn't live up to their potential either, but at least the first one blew up Alderaan). </TEXT>
