	<TEXT> Yes, it does - but I also understand why it happens! I am an author and a publisher once told me that on average there can be up to 20 typos per book. And if a book goes to print and some are found later within this "20 rule" that it's acceptable. It cost far too much to pull the book back, re-edit, and upload online and layout again for printing. Really, think about it. An average novel for adults can be 100K words. It's very small in the scheme of things. Even with the author reading it several times and more than one editor. Things still get overlooked. And as a matter of fact, I am reading The Book Thief now and only 80 pages in and already have caught 2 typos! Very minor...but still! It happens more than you think. Human error :). We do not live in a perfect world but we do live in a wonderful world with storytelling - so this makes it worthwhile.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fran, I love this title THE WITCH WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD! What was the collaborative process like on this - compared to writing a novel solo and how hard is it to keep a consistent voice and tone with so many authors? Would you ever write a novel collaboratively?  </TEXT>
