	<TEXT> in a movie sense having it be mostly modern day is the only way to go otherwise the stories would be way too separate. The whole point of the past in the games and likely this movie is to move forward the modern day. If they had minimal modern day the movie would feel way to disjointed for audiences </TEXT>
