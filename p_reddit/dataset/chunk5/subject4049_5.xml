Me -"So...uh...we're going to be really busy for the rest of the week...uh..we need to use 'this' space to move some stuff around. "


Guest - "Oh this space rig...?"


Me - "Yeeeeaaah that space..."


Guest - "Could I move over 'there?'"


Me - "Well you could, but just to be safe...we'll need this whole area."


Guest - "Hey what about the guest room?"

Me - "Oh yeah, forgot about that...um...we're renovating that room...so...yeeeeaaah."


Guest - "Is there any where else I c..."


Me - "Probably not, we basically need as much space as possible."


Guest - "You need help with anything?"


Me - "Nah I think we're all good here."


Guest - "When are you star...?"


Me - "After you leave."


Guest - "Do you guys want to do anything before I go back home?"


Me - "I think we're all pretty tired."


Guest - "But it's 3:30..."


Me - *stretching and yawning* well... we need to turn in early so we can wake up early to get this job done."


Guess - "Well..."


Me - "OK we'll see you soon bud."


Guest - *Walking to door* "Thanks for letting me...wait I forgot my stuff."


Me - "I took the liberty of putting your luggage in your car...so..."


Guest - *Awkward silence*


Me - *Awkward silence*


Guest - *Walking out door* "Well thanks for letting me stay..."

	<TEXT> I'm dealing with the same thing now...I programmed all the time in High School. I made programs, websites, and right before I graduated, I started to make mini games.(using Python) But since I go to college, now i'm stuck with General studies more than anything. The only thing I do with a computer now is go to websites to pay for things, go to my email, and occasionally watch a video or comment and reply on Reddit.

	<TEXT> Ill admit that Sasuke is the punching bag of the series and Sasuke would be a great Hokage over Naruto...If he didn't carry the curse of hatred of the Uchiha. You say that Naruto wants to become Hokage for power and prestige, sure I can agree with that but he also wants peace, he has used his abilities to do that. Sasuke wants revenge against the leaf village and won't stop until the leaf village is destroyed. He even said at one point he did not care if he had to sacrifice his own body to Orochimaru as long as it served his quest for revenge. If he accomplishes all of this THEN he wants peace...using force just like Obito. Sasuke at this point really shouldn't be Hokage.  </TEXT>

If someone gives you gold they obviously liked a comment you made or something you posted. Reddit gold is a way to upgrade your Reddit account to block ads and other things that you know you never need to use. People pay to give gold and have gold and it supports Reddit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't go through with the bid. When I did freelance work for companies, they asked what company I worked for and I explained that I was a freelancer so they asked for my portfolio. Which should be past projects you worked on. I recommend maybe just taking a poorly made website and try to design it to the best of your abilities. If you want to be safe just ask the owner of the website if you could use the code and proceed to build your portfolio before taking on large projects that involve money. </TEXT>
