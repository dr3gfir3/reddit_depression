	<TEXT> La La Land: I would not call it an unhappy ending, because [both characters got everything they ever wanted, except that they did not end up together, which, ultimately, is perfectly ok.](#spoiler) It was bittersweet, sure, but hardly sad or unhappy.

Arrival: Since when do moody sci-fi films need to have a happy ending? Most of the good ones sure don't.

Overall: I think the lack of happy endings might be caused by:

* the predominantly pessimistic attitude prevalent in society right now

* the fact that some of these movies aimed to be realistic and real life rarely has happy endings

* the stereotypical Hollywood happy ending is actually lazy and escapist and serious filmmakers are doing something more interesting </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People keep reading into this and inferring the plot based on these three inspirations. But have you even read the article?

Twelve OClock High was a big touchstone, for the feel and look of the aerial combat as well as the dynamic between the pilots, Johnson told Empire.

He continued: Three Outlaw Samurai for the feel of the sword-fighting, and the general sense of pulpy fun. And To Catch A Thief was a great film to rewatch, for the romantic scale and grandeur.

He liked aerial battles in one, swordfights and fun in another, and romance and grandeur in the third. None of that means there will be any similarities between those movies and Ep. VIII in terms of plot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DS9's first two seasons were better than TNG's first two seasons, but yes, I agree with you OP that it got better when Worf and the Dominion came. However, I'm not a big fan of season 7, especially the last couple of episodes, which focused way too much the on Dominion war and the Pah Wraiths, to the point where supporting characters overshadowed the main characters. There was so much focus on Kai Winn, Bajoran Dukat, Damar, and even Gauron vs. Martok, while Sisko, Chief, Quark, Jake, Nog and to a large extent also Bashir and Odo had little to do. 

edit: a couple of words </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  we only get one exposition dump, and that is explaining John himself

I don't even mind this exposition dump for two reasons:

* It's a reversal on the more common exposition dump, where the hero is told who the villain is. We are usually with the hero from the beginning and we get to know him. Very likely it follows the hero myth and there is a wise old man explaining about the villain directly to the hero. Here, John Wick is the hero (anti-hero, really) but he receives no explanations about anything. He is already established within the world of the film and knows his way around. On the other hand, a young criminal, who takes the role of the villain, is the one on a hero's journey, albeit a very misguided and amoral one. And he receives explanations about the hero from an older and wiser man. As I said, a reversal.

* It makes sense within the narrative of the movie that Iosef would not know that much about John Wick, because that business was before of his time. After all, Wick was already retired, seemingly for quite a while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Random things that come out of the earth are assigned seemingly random values. The dirt isn't valued by anyone. We literally call it dirt. The same word we use to describe the foul, the unclean. And yet dirt is soil and that's where we get all the food. On the other hand, people have killed each other over pieces of diamonds or rubies, and yet they are made of carbon, or dirt. And even the value itself is assigned in contradicting ways. Diamonds and rubies are considered rare and finite in their numbers, which we celebrate by cutting them into polished pieces of precious rock on a wedding ring. Are you celebrating the beauty of the diamond or disrupting its natural form and depleting its reserves? A lump of carbon is considered precious because we want to have it in pleasing forms. A stalactite, though, is a lump of calcium, which is a more rare element, and is considered precious because we find it pleasing in its natural undisturbed form. Is it because the stones are shiny? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> John Wick's world-building is so intriguing because the film is made like a sequel </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> John Wick has amazing action but the thing I like the most about it is how it expects the audience to keep up. There aren't obvious info-dump scenes and the dialogue is not awkwardly structured to explain things. And now it dawned on me that the writers did this so successfully by writing John Wick as if it were a sequel to a movie that doesn't exist.

The way certain scenes play out ("Noise complaint?" "Noise complaint.") or how certain characters meet (when the receptionist welcomes John Wick back at the hotel after a long absence) gives you a strong sense of history between everyone. It gives you a sense that this is a world that has been around for a while and you are given a glimpse of it sometime in the middle of its existence. But these scenes also feel like nods or references to a prior movie. Just try an imagine that there actually was a movie before John Wick and that the 2014 movie we know and love is its sequel. In it I picture a whole sequence with the cop that the "noise complaint" scene is referencing, winking at the audience ("Remember the last time the cop showed up because of a noise complaint?"). Like an easter egg for fans of the first movie. In sequels we often tend to cringe at these fan service nods, but in John Wick it works perfectly because we don't know what it is nodding to. It just lets us imagine what might have happened between them before, or who the cop really is, etc.

	<TEXT> I assumed as much though I haven't read it. Still I don't think source material is an adequate excuse. You can always adapt it to suite your medium. A film is not a novel. Also, I don't know if the book is as disjointed as the movie, but the way I see it is that:

* either the book isn't very good to begin with and Affleck should have either changed things or just not adapt it at all,

* or the book was much better and Affleck screwed it up with a poor adaptation + terrible editing

Regardless of whether the book has the same problems as the film or not, it's still not a good film and things could have been done to fix that. I find it hard to believe that the man who made The Town and Argo would go to a theater to see Live By Night and consider it a good film.

edit: some words </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It definitely sounds like way too much. I don't know if they meant this to be just for movie piracy or combined with music and TV, but it still sounds like a preposterously high number. But even if it were accurate, it's not like the industry is missing that money. It's not like studious are going bankrupt and actors are losing jobs because of torrents. People who will watch shitty cam versions or lower quality screeners are people who were not planning on paying for your movie even if it didn't show up on Pirate Bay. Either because they can't afford it, or the movie isn't available in their country, or they don't care about the movie enough to go to the cinema, or just on some dumb anti-establishment principle. Whichever is the case, you could say the studio isn't really losing money because they weren't going to earn it in the first place. If all pirating stopped, $20 billion would not suddenly pour into the market. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Live by Night is Affleck's weakest directorial effort, though this is not down to his abilities behind the camera. The movie is technically proficient and beautifully shot. Its main problems lie with Affleck's abilities behind a typewriter. His script lacks focus, switching from a Scorsese imitation gangster movie (complete with a Joe Pesci lookalike) to romantic, social and family drama without any balance between them. Certain scenes are either left out or skimmed over in favor of less interesting things and the dialogues often try to sound profound but usually fall flat. The film's terrible editing doesn't help to mitigate these issues, either. Even Affleck the actor is lacking in some respects. His bulky Batman physique, stern unmoving face and large immaculately pressed suits make him look like a mannequin posed among vintage cars and 1930s costumed extras. There are many things in Live by Night that could have worked and many things that could have been left out. A great movie is visible buried underneath the mess. Is there a script doctor in the house? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The absolute worst thing about shaky cam and fast edits is when a new generation grows up watching these shitty 2000s action films. What kind of filmmakers will we have in 20 years if the future directors are watching Bourne and Taken? And what kind of audiences will we have? I heard 15-year-olds complain that Die Hard was boring and stupid because the action was so slow. They seem to want shaky cam and fast edits because that is all they get.

**Edit** Off topic, but relevant nonetheless: To a certain degree this also applies to jump scares in horror movies. Jump scares are lazy and they suck. But younger audiences find movies like The Sining, The Exorcist, or the more recent The Witch, boring because those films don't scare them by a dumb loud noise. </TEXT>
