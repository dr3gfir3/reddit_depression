	<TEXT> Britain turns to South Korea to salvage Moorside nuclear project

Future of new reactor thrown in doubt by financial crisis at Toshiba
  
YESTERDAY by: Andrew Ward, Energy Editor
Greg Clark, UK business secretary, will visit Seoul this week in a bid to salvage the multibillion pound Moorside nuclear power project in Cumbria.


Moorside is an important part of Britains plans for a new generation of nuclear reactors to maintain energy security but its future has been thrown into doubt by the financial crisis at Toshiba, the Japanese group leading the Cumbrian project.

Mr Clark will meet senior South Korean government officials and nuclear industry executives to discuss potential investment in Moorside by Kepco, the state-controlled utility.


Toshiba is keen to sell its majority stake in NuGen, the consortium planning to build the Moorside power station, and Kepco is widely considered the most plausible buyer.

Saving Moorside is key not only to Britains energy policy but also to safeguard the future of nuclear power in west Cumbria, where the industry has been a big employer since the worlds first commercial reactor opened at Calder Hall in 1956.

As well as the nuclear issue, Mr Clark will use his visit to discuss trade ties with South Korea  one of Asias biggest economies  after the UK leaves the EU. In a statement confirming his trip, Mr Clark said the partnership with South Korea was a clear example of how strategic international relationships can power...a global Britain.

He highlighted biotechnology and manufacturing among other areas he would be discussing with South Korea but nuclear power is expected to top the agenda because of the urgency of attracting investors to help replace several old nuclear plants and coal-fired power stations due to be decommissioned in coming years.

Kepco confirmed last month that it was interested in joining the Moorside project as part of its efforts to become a force in the global nuclear industry. The company is building several reactors in South Korea and the United Arab Emirates but Britain would provide a bridgehead into more developed markets.

Big questions remain over the terms of potential Korean participation in Moorside  particularly whether the British government would be willing to contribute towards the estimated 10bn-15bn needed to build the plant, or at least provide credit guarantees.

Mixed signals have emerged from the Treasury and Mr Clarks Department for Business, Energy   Industrial Strategy about whether the government is willing to drop its longstanding resistance to committing public money to the expensive and risky business of building nuclear reactors.

 Another focus of discussion with Mr Clark will be whether Kepco would stick with the Westinghouse AP1000 reactors planned for Moorside or substitute its own APR1400 technology. Westinghouse, a subsidiary of Toshiba, last week filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after big cost overruns at nuclear power projects in South Carolina and Georgia.

The Koreans will want to do very thorough due diligence on what has gone wrong in the US before committing to using the AP1000, said a senior figure in the nuclear industry.

The AP1000 was last week approved for use at Moorside by the UK nuclear regulator after a decade-long review and any attempt by Kepco to replace the technology with its own APR1400 would set the project back several years. It would take NuGen back to the drawing board because all the permitting and licensing so far has been based on use of the AP1000, said an industry figure.

NuGen already has ties to Kepco through its chief executive, Tom Samson, who previously worked on the South Korean nuclear project in Abu Dhabi, which, unlike most new reactors around the world, has proceeded on time and on budget.

It is hoped that Korean involvement would help deliver a significantly lower price of electricity from Moorside than from Hinkley Point, the 18bn nuclear plant in Somerset under construction by EDF of France, which has stirred controversy for its high cost. Hinkley Point, due to open in 2025, is on course to be the first new nuclear power station in Britain since the 1990s.
