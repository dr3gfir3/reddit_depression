	<TITLE> Book Insights from Work Rules!: Insights from inside Google by Laszlo Bock. Most pertain to Googles People Operations, modern equivalent of HR </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-28 15:28:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Improve Performance with OKR Goals**

One way to drive performance is by emphasizing personal growth. One of the reasons Google uses OKR Goals  and why **theyre so powerful  is because they simultaneously drive personal growth by encouraging employees to meet their own individual objectives while contributing to company goals,** since all priorities are aligned.

OKRs consist of Objectives and Key Results. Some Objectives should be aspirational, while others can be operational. Key Results are used to determine what needs to be done to accomplish the Objectives, and should be measurable.

Google still uses OKRs to this day. Not only are they effective for accomplishing goals, but research demonstrates that you can improve employee performance when you invite individuals to be committed to their goals. Likewise, youll improve employee engagement when you collaborate with your people to set ambitious, specific goals. Treat Your People like theyre Irreplaceable

Bock said that prior to his experience at Google, he was frustrated with the fact that **leaders always spoke of putting people first, and then treated them like replaceable gears.** Google, however, has an incredibly stringent hiring process. Google recruiters use sample work tests to see their candidates in action, and they tend to hire individuals with ambition and curiosity over experience.

If you take the time to hire the right people, they really will become irreplaceable. And thats a benefit for both you and your hires: when you find the right fit, Bock says, people require less training, and on top of that, employees will be put in a position where they can really use and build upon their strengths.

**Learn to Give Feedback Separately from Consequences**

Your aim in providing ongoing employee feedback should be to drive performance. When someone is performing below your expectations, the feedback you provide shouldnt be about repercussions, it should be focused on giving that employee everything he needs to succeed (resources, information, and clear expectations, etc.). Compensation and promotions are separate entities, and are therefore are not main components of your ongoing, continuous loop of feedback.

**Use Actions to Support Your Mission**

Every company should have a mission, but more importantly, Bock believes that **each companys mission should be specific and driven by actions and activities.** If your mission is too vague, or if you never drive your mission through tangible actions, its likely that it wont resonate with your employees.

**Dont Weigh Your Company Down with Rules**

Bock recommends trusting your employees to do the right thing without setting forth too many strict guidelines. He believes that **when too many rules are enforced, creativity and motivation are diminished,** thereby thwarting productivity.

**Never Start Out with Negative Assumptions**

**Managers and execs who start out with the belief that their people are inherently good will fare better than others,** according to Bock. If you start out with the assumption that your employees are out to rip you off, you risk developing a rule-driven, negative environment in which employees do only whats required of them from the get go. Bock believes that this sort of optimism is what sets great organizations apart from others, because its there that people can truly excel, thrive, and do their best work.

**Excel by using Small Experiments**

Google takes an interesting approach in trying out new systems and tools: they try them out, as would a scientific researcher, on different groups of people before implementing them fully. Always fond of data, Google execs will study the performance quality and morale of the test groups to see how well the new tool or system is working. You, too, can **collect insights from your employees after you try new things** by retrieving data through your weekly progress reports.

**Build Trust and Commitment through Transparency**

Bock advocates always keeping your employees in the loop about whats going on inside the company. This, he says, fosters commitment, because it encourages employees to think that theyre all in it together. The emphasis in your company should be on unity, not on division. As such, you need to remain open and transparent on all levels. Without that transparency, you wont be able to build trust, and your people will be less likely to commit fully to your company.

**Take Advantage of Mistakes**

Google encourages its employees to take sensible risks, and as such, they acknowledge that failure is sometimes inevitable. But as Bock notes, failures can breed intelligence  people tend to learn more after mistakes than they do when things go smoothly. Failures can actually be successes, because they ultimately foster growth and development. Yet, in order to achieve that growth and development, you must let your people know that its okay to make mistakes.

	<TITLE> Book Insights from "Built to Last - Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" by James Collins and Jerry Porras </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-28 15:16:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What are the behaviors that make companies last decades  even past the century mark  and achieve continued success? James Collins and Jerry Porras peer behind the scenes of such organizations, which theyve dubbed visionary companies, in their compilation Built to Last. These companies are visionary, indeed: they have an average founding date of 1897 and experienced stock-return performance 15 times greater than the general market since 1926. Here are the things that have made them so successful, and what you can do to build your organization to last:

**Take an Architectural Approach**

Developing an organization built upon strong systems and values is the first step of building a company made to last. Identify your values and the systems youll use to reflect them, prior to even developing your product.

*Hewlett-Packard and Sony: Great Companies First, Innovative Products Later*

HP and Sony developed some products that, by todays standards, seem lackluster: urinal flushers and heating pads, respectively, were among the companies earliest products. Yet, these companies continue to thrive today not because of their earliest products, but because they took an architectural approach, focusing on values and systems first.

*The Myth of Charismatic Leaders*

Some built-to-last companies had visionary leaders, but not all. What is crucial, however, is having leaders that facilitate the development of their people and processes. Some of the most successful leaders, such Motorola founder Paul Galvin, encourage dissent, discussion, and disagreement to prompt their people to make meaningful contributions. This allowed Motorola to outperform Zenith, a company that had a visionary leader but lost a great deal of its success after he passed.

**Ideals Drive Visionary Organizations**

*Mercks Giveaway*

At its core, your organization must have ideologies in place that go beyond the purpose of being lucrative. Merck, for one, embodied their core ideology of being genuinely inspired by the ideals of advancement of medical science, and of service to humanity when they gave a drug, Mectizan, away for free to millions of people who needed it after no one bought it. Pfizer leaders, on the other hand, have explicitly stated that the companys goal is to get profit out of everything they do.

*Core Ideologies*

To establish your own core ideology, ask yourself this: who are we, what do we stand for, and what are we all about? These are your shaping forces upon which your company can be built. Even when your organization is more ideologically-driven than profit-driven, it actually pays off more in terms of profitability. J. Willard Marriott, Sr., for example, said that he didnt set out to build an empire; rather, his goal was to provide friendly service and good food at a fair price, and work hard to make a profit  in that very order.

*Values vs. Purposes*

Your organizations core values are its guiding principles; they cannot be compromised for financial gains. Usually, they can be summed up in a simple statement. Purposes, on the other hand, identify your reason for existing. They should be broad and enduring, such as Johnson   Johnsons purpose to alleviate pain and suffering, or Disneys: to use our imaginations to bring happiness to millions. To identify your purpose, simply ask of your organization: what is our reason for being?

*Preserve the Core; Stimulate Progress*

You can change your strategy, tactics, operations, products, and culture over time, but core ideology should never waver. Do not wait for a sign that its time to change; instead, practice self-criticism regularly. Wal-Mart, for example, continually seeks to exceed customer expectations.

**Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals**

*Boeings Challenge*

To outlast your competitors, your organization must pursue big, hairy, audacious goals (BHAGs), such as Boeings commitment to build a jet for commercial use, which resulted in the 707. It met a similar challenge in developing the 727 by meeting stringent specifications outlined by Eastern Airlines. Through each feat, Boeing managed to conquer the BHAGs while maintaining their core values: to be on the leading edge of aviation.

*Set BHAGs that are Clear   Compelling*

BHAGS should require little or no explanation, should go beyond an organizations comfort zone, should provoke excitement, and align with core ideology. They can even be somewhat risky, and go beyond the life of the current leader.

**Great Places to Work  For Some**

If your organization is built to last using a very specific architectural approach, then its impossible that not every potential hire will fit in there  and thats okay.

*Cult-like Cultures*

Having a culture thats almost cult-like allows a company to promote values while still letting employees feel a sense of belonging. Nordsrom, for example, has a longstanding history of Nordies who deliver superb service and belong to the company, which even has chants of affirmation. To build a balanced and healthy culture of cultism, you should promote from within, offer workplace socializing opportunities, have training programs geared towards your ideologies, and continue to emphasize heritage and organizational values.

*Home-Grown Management*

Of all the 18 visionary companies, there are only four instances in which they went outside the organization for a CEO. By planning for succession, you can promote from within and still stimulate growth and change. GE, for example, makes a habit of promoting and developing carefully selected talent from within.

**Pounce on Opportunities**

*Lucrative Accidents*

Visionary companies dont just learn from their mistakes  they can actually capitalize on them. Johnson   Johnson developed antiseptic gauze that caused irritation. In response, they developed a can of talc to soothe skin, which eventually became one of its best-selling products: baby powder.

*Evolution*

Accidental progress leads to evolution. Innovative steps taken  no matter how small  can turn into lucrative opportunities. Be sure to experiment and allow room for the strongest results to thrive.

*Variation*

Most visionary companies practice some form of this motto: try something, and if it works, keep it. If it doesnt, change something. Wal-Mart greeters, for example, were actually designed to prevent shoplifting. The experiment worked successfully, which is why youll find greeters in locations nationwide.

*Success of 3M*

Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) originally set out to be a mining company. It soon failed, but eventually wound up developing Scotch tape, thanks, in part, to the fact that each day they use 15% and 30% rules: 15% of the time, technical people can spend time on their own projects, and 30% of each divisions revenue is expected to come from products and services introduced within the past four years.

**Never Rest**

Visionary organizations dont simply assess how theyre doing now; they plan to do better for the future.

*Continuous Improvement*

To stay ahead of the game, companies such as Merck, HP, and Motorola simulate discontent. For example, Boeing uses an eyes of the enemy approach to prompt managers to develop strategies as if they were competitors. Both Nordstrom and HP rank sellers performances based on peers sales.

**Beyond Vision Statements: Ford**

The essence of an organization is the translation of ideology and drive for progress into its fabric. This essence can come to life through goals, pay systems, and cultural practices.

*Alignment*

Ford needed to revamp itself in the 1980s, so it came out with its Mission, Values, and Guiding Principles (MVGP), which emphasized people before products and profits. This aligned the organization to emphasize the fact that people are a companys best asset by developing employee involvement and customer satisfaction.

*Ideology and Aims into Reality*

Dont just create a document such as Fords MVGP  you must also act upon these findings. Ford created employee-involvement programs and participative-management programs to embody their MVGP.

*World-Class BHAGs*

Ford used Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals to develop an entirely new, world-class car. It resulted in the top-selling car in the nation, the Taurus. To follow through with your own BHAGs, make sure that all company practices, programs, communications can be harmonized and mesh with your core ideologies and goals.

**Six Steps to Visionary Alignment**

To achieve alignment on a visionary level, you must:

1. Outline the whole picture by making sure that all of your elements work together.

2. Sweat the small stuff  worry about little details if you consider them important and they make a lasting impression.

3. Cluster, dont shotgun by using processes that reinforce one another.

4. Swim in your own current by asking whether your processes and practices work for your organization  dont concern yourself with what others are doing.

5. Obliterate misalignment. If something is out of synch with your core ideology, then change it.

6. Abide by the universal requirements  your core ideology and drive for progress are fundamental, and as long as you have an organization that preserves your core and stimulates progress, then its built to last.

	<TITLE> The Way Were Working Isnt Working: The Four Forgotten Needs that Energize Great Performance by Tony Schwartz - Book Insights </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-28 14:12:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Employees Need More Than Money**

Judging by the recent statistics, managers arent doing enough to keep employees engaged[/glossary] at work. Research has shown that employees are not satisfied with financial compensation alone, and that they must be connected to a greater purpose at work. In order to feel engaged at work (i.e., committed to the organization and willing to contribute discretionary efforts), presenting employees with the time for money exchange wont suffice.More importantly, employee engagement isnt just about making your associates feel good  its a critical component that has a direct impact on nearly every business result. Thus, in order to drive performance and results, you must find another source of motivation outside of compensation alone.

**Acknowledge the 4 Energy Types to Motivate Employees**

Schwartz believes that keeping employees energized is the secret for driving high performance. He feels that this is the responsibility of the executive, and he identifies four main energy sources that must be fostered: sustainability (physical), significance (spiritual), self-expression (mental), and security (emotional).

**Stop Draining Your Peoples Energy**

Typically, executives and managers are hard-wired to think that the more they can get out of their people, the more success their business will have. This is a flawed way of thinking, however. Instead of draining their associates energy levels, managers and executives should be seeking ways to strategically fuel their energy. Taking this unique approach to management will allow associates to experience a sense of empowerment and inspiration so that they can continually dedicate their best efforts to the organization.

Physical/Sustainability Energy

While mental burnout is a common symptom of the overworked employee, physical exhaustion is a common (but critical) workplace issue as well. To prevent your employees from becoming physically drained, you should employ the use of frequent breaks. This will allow them to maintain high energy levels, and it will actually make them more productive overall. While it may seem counterproductive to allow more frequent breaks, most employees cant sustain high performance for hours and hours of uninterrupted work. In fact, Schwartz cites the 90 minute rule, a principle that claims employees have a 90-minute cycle during which they go from having a high level of alertness to a low level of alertness. Thus, by implementing frequent breaks, youll actually boost productivity.One way to determine whether your employees physical energy is drained is to simply ask them. You can implement these types of questions in your weekly pulse report or during your one-on-one meetings:

* How long do you work for without taking a break?
* By the time you leave work, how tired are you?
* How easy/difficult is it for you to achieve a work/life balance?

You can even get creative with your breaks; they dont all have to consist of watercooler chats. If it suits your company culture, encourage employees to mediate, listen to music, or even get a few minutes of exercise.

**Emotional/Security Energy**

In order for employees to perform their best, they must feel valued. This encourages development and keeps employees in the performance zone. Because all humans maintain a fight or flight mentality, employees will become detached if they sense that theyre no longer valued at work. What theyre seeking is security, or a leader who empowers his people by showing them that theyre appreciated.Schwartz also recommends that all parties  executives, managers, and associates  acknowledge both their failures as well as their strengths. The purpose of this transparency is to strengthen the positive aspects of performance and improve the negative aspects.

**Mental/Self Expression**

The greatest way to strengthen mental energy is to create an environment in which laser focusing is encouraged and rewarded. The inability to direct absorbed focus to tasks has a detrimental effect on quality of work, and as such, distractions should be limited as much as possible.Some key tactics for strengthening mental energy are:

* Limiting distractions and encouraging employees to focus on one task at a time
* Discouraging multitasking
* Setting an agenda and sticking to it
* Focusing only on small amounts of information at a time
* Designating a specific start/stop time for meetings

**Spiritual/Significance**

As previously mentioned, employees absolutely must have a sense of greater purpose for the work they do; otherwise, they wont have anything to which they can commit fully, which is an integral component of engagement.

The job of executives is to create work that has a distinct purpose and is injected with company values. For that to happen, CEOs must first have a set of clear company values. Then, you must recruit and retain individuals whose values reflect those of the company. Both the employees and the company itself must share a common purpose; that way, as associates grow and increase their capacity, the organization also becomes stronger.

Schwartzs suggestions are valuable for organizations of any size, as they allow leaders to identify the ways in which they can empower employees to perform their best through energizing tactics. If you can employ the tactics above and drive focus towards company goals while simultaneously engaging and energizing your associates, youll create a powerful approach to management through which your best possible results will be achieved.

**1. Support Your People AND Results, Not Either/Or**

The book starts with an employee whos searching for the ideal manager  one who seeks to manage both his people and the outcomes for which theyre responsible, not one or the other. The manager who focuses too exclusively on results risks low morale and a disengaged workforce. The manager who focuses only on his peoples happiness is destined to fall short in terms of business outcomes.Whats the solution? The best manager knows how to set clear goals collaboratively with her people to engage them in challenges that will support company initiatives. She cares not only about her people, but how theyre progressing both with goals and personal growth.

**2. One Minute Is All You Need for Clear Goals**

The first step in achieving big results is setting clear goals. The authors believe that 80% of your most significant business outcomes will come from only 20% of your goals. Its doubly important, then, to set goals that have clear expectations. At Atiim, we believe clear and effective goal setting is such an integral part of performance management that weve based our entire OKR Goals Software on this very principle. Blanchard and Johnson recommend that everyone should know exactly whats expected for goals up front  there should not be any surprises, and it should only take one minute to explain the goal (Objective) and steps needed to get there (Key Results).

**3. Praise Can Be Accomplished in One Minute, Too**

Part of todays ongoing performance management is giving regular feedback. Praise is an important component of feedback  so much so that it should be done twice or three times as often as you criticize. So, when you observe an employee doing something well  whether its a big milestone or a small, weekly win  take a minute to praise him or her for it.The authors argument is that it only takes a minute or less to tell someone theyve done a good job, and thereby effectively encourage them to continue doing well in the future. It shows your team that you take a genuine interest in their success.

**4. One Minute Is Just Enough for Criticism**

On the opposite end of praise, we have criticism (or reprimand, as the authors call it). Because youre only taking a few moments to praise, its important not to reprimand for any period of time longer than that. Otherwise, employees might begin to think that their shortcomings are more significant than their strengths, and thats something you dont want to happen. Instead, take a brief minute to tackle any bad behavior head-on. Use this two-pronged approach to address an issue: tell the employee first what he or she did wrong, and allow it to sink in for a moment. (Yes, this part can be a bit uncomfortable.) Then, follow up by saying that you value the persons work and explain how much you think the employee is capable of  this is to reassure them, which must go hand-in-hand with reprimand. The idea is to emphasize the issue with the work, not the person.

Like praise, reprimands should be given in a timely manner. Catching an employee soon after the bad behavior took place will have a more positive impact for the future than bringing it up weeks after it happened.

	<TITLE> Employee Engagement for Everyone by Kevin Kruse - Book Summary   Insights </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-27 12:55:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> While Kruse boldly appeals to everyone in his title, what both intrigued and impressed me is his rejection of the one-size-fits all approach to employee engagement. Instead, he recognizes that each business leader must identify a solution that fits the unique needs of his or her company.

**Employee Engagement Affects More than Profits**

The correlation between employee engagement and profits is alarming enough on its own  companies with engagement levels under 25% suffer negative total shareholders return, or TSR; (this and other eye-opening statistics linking profits to employee engagement collected by Kruse can be found here). Beyond profits, when you neglect employee engagement, youll also suffer in the areas of quality, safety, retention, service, and more.

**Use the Four Pillars to Improve Employee Engagement**

There are four essential aspects of employee engagement. They are trust, communication, growth, and recognition. How you balance the four pillars will depend on your organizational needs. Kruse provides detailed, actionable steps about how you can improve each aspect, but heres my overview:

* Growth. You must challenge all of your employees regularly and make advancement opportunities available.
* Communication. Check in frequently (once-per-year reviews no longer work, weekly check-ins do) and establish a two-way feedback loop with each of direct reports.
* Trust. Show everyone how they fit into company goals.
* Recognition. Lastly, giving praise and showing appreciation can go a long way in making employees feel their efforts are validated.

**Give Everyone a Role in Employee Engagement**

Interestingly, Kruse provides strategies that can be adopted by both executives AND their employees. Not only does he show us what we can do as leaders to drive engagement, but he presents simple solutions for employees to help show managers the ways in which they can be engaged most effectively at work. For employees, this puts some of the power in their own hands, and for leaders, it emphasizes the point that engagement is a unique endeavor that must fit well with company culture and can be further tailored to meet the needs of the individual.

**Address Actively Disengaged Employees**

Kruse refers to actively disengaged employees as Debbie Downers, and says that not only do we need to find unique solutions for handling them, but we must also avoid becoming one. This is of monumental importance, as active disengagement can easily become contagious if not handled appropriately. Find the solution that fits best with your company culture by asking your employees questions about morale in your weekly progress reports.

**Dont Treat Engagement as a Top-Down Issue**

As previously mentioned, EVERYONE can play a part in driving employee engagement. That means that CEOs alone shouldnt carry the burden of improving engagement; rather, it needs to be a team-wide initiative. Managers are best suited for overseeing the employee engagement of their direct reports, so collaborate with them to develop solutions for improving engagement. They may have better ideas about how you can use team-targeted engagement solutions to drive focus, performance, and commitment, and ultimately, achieve aggressive goals to secure big wins.

	<TITLE> [Misc] Book Insights from Work Rules!: Insights from inside Google by Laszlo Bock. Most pertain to Googles People Operations, modern equivalent of HR </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-27 12:47:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Improve Performance with OKR Goals**

One way to drive performance is by emphasizing personal growth. One of the reasons Google uses OKR Goals  and why **theyre so powerful  is because they simultaneously drive personal growth by encouraging employees to meet their own individual objectives while contributing to company goals,** since all priorities are aligned.

OKRs consist of Objectives and Key Results. Some Objectives should be aspirational, while others can be operational. Key Results are used to determine what needs to be done to accomplish the Objectives, and should be measurable.

Google still uses OKRs to this day. Not only are they effective for accomplishing goals, but research demonstrates that you can improve employee performance when you invite individuals to be committed to their goals. Likewise, youll improve employee engagement when you collaborate with your people to set ambitious, specific goals. Treat Your People like theyre Irreplaceable

Bock said that prior to his experience at Google, he was frustrated with the fact that **leaders always spoke of putting people first, and then treated them like replaceable gears.** Google, however, has an incredibly stringent hiring process. Google recruiters use sample work tests to see their candidates in action, and they tend to hire individuals with ambition and curiosity over experience.

If you take the time to hire the right people, they really will become irreplaceable. And thats a benefit for both you and your hires: when you find the right fit, Bock says, people require less training, and on top of that, employees will be put in a position where they can really use and build upon their strengths.

**Learn to Give Feedback Separately from Consequences**

Your aim in providing ongoing employee feedback should be to drive performance. When someone is performing below your expectations, the feedback you provide shouldnt be about repercussions, it should be focused on giving that employee everything he needs to succeed (resources, information, and clear expectations, etc.). Compensation and promotions are separate entities, and are therefore are not main components of your ongoing, continuous loop of feedback.

**Use Actions to Support Your Mission**

Every company should have a mission, but more importantly, Bock believes that **each companys mission should be specific and driven by actions and activities.** If your mission is too vague, or if you never drive your mission through tangible actions, its likely that it wont resonate with your employees.

**Dont Weigh Your Company Down with Rules**

Bock recommends trusting your employees to do the right thing without setting forth too many strict guidelines. He believes that **when too many rules are enforced, creativity and motivation are diminished,** thereby thwarting productivity.

**Never Start Out with Negative Assumptions**

**Managers and execs who start out with the belief that their people are inherently good will fare better than others,** according to Bock. If you start out with the assumption that your employees are out to rip you off, you risk developing a rule-driven, negative environment in which employees do only whats required of them from the get go. Bock believes that this sort of optimism is what sets great organizations apart from others, because its there that people can truly excel, thrive, and do their best work.

**Excel by using Small Experiments**

Google takes an interesting approach in trying out new systems and tools: they try them out, as would a scientific researcher, on different groups of people before implementing them fully. Always fond of data, Google execs will study the performance quality and morale of the test groups to see how well the new tool or system is working. You, too, can **collect insights from your employees after you try new things** by retrieving data through your weekly progress reports.

**Build Trust and Commitment through Transparency**

Bock advocates always keeping your employees in the loop about whats going on inside the company. This, he says, fosters commitment, because it encourages employees to think that theyre all in it together. The emphasis in your company should be on unity, not on division. As such, you need to remain open and transparent on all levels. Without that transparency, you wont be able to build trust, and your people will be less likely to commit fully to your company.

**Take Advantage of Mistakes**

Google encourages its employees to take sensible risks, and as such, they acknowledge that failure is sometimes inevitable. But as Bock notes, failures can breed intelligence  people tend to learn more after mistakes than they do when things go smoothly. Failures can actually be successes, because they ultimately foster growth and development. Yet, in order to achieve that growth and development, you must let your people know that its okay to make mistakes.

	<TITLE> Book Insights from Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-21 20:08:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Use your Past to Fuel Future Motivation**

In this biography, we learn that Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa. He had a less-than-ideal upbringing, and his family life was tumultuous. Vance reveals that Musk never felt as if he fit in with the culture  which idealized athletes and jocks  in Pretoria, and as his family quibbles escalated over the years, he envisioned a way in which he could escape. Despite an imperfect start, however, Musk remained extremely ambitious into his later years.

**Network with People who Identify with Your Passions**

During his time at the University of Pennsylvania, Musk began to associate with physics majors, who were aligned with his interests and passions. After spending some time with his like-minded cohorts, it became apparent that Musk, too, was of similar intellect: he received a 98 on a paper on solar energy during his senior year. His enthusiasm extended beyond receiving good grades: When I was in college, I wanted to be involved with things that would change the world, Musk said. What we can all learn from Musk is that working with like-minded people often yields impressive results, because shared passions are a powerful tool in any entrepreneurial endeavor.

**Be Willing to Put in Long Days and Late Nights (at least in the beginning)**

Musks original startup, Zip2, didnt take off right away. In fact, it required many late nights, during which Musk would actually sleep under his desk. Hed ask other employees to wake him in the morning so that he could start working again. This kind of relentless drive and dedication is what Musk used to build not only startups, but startups that were sustainable.

**Know when to Practice Restraint**

In 2000, Musks fellow executives cast him aside as CEO of the company that would eventually become PayPal. Despite being forced into a lower position, Musk refused to react bitterly towards the other execs. Instead, Musk remained supportive of the company. He was PayPals largest shareholder, and by 2003, his shares amounted to $250 million. Having restraint when facing challenges at work  especially those that may seem personal  can help you to succeed in the long run.

**Communicate Openly**

For a period of time, Musk evaded the public eye. While some speculate that he might be a shy individual, Musk learned quickly that CEOs and entrepreneurs must be comfortable with an open exchange of regular communication to be respected  and to garner positive attention for their companies. Musk is active on Twitter, and he believes that CEOs and other execs must assume a role of responsibility in communicating with their target audiences about their products or services.

	<TEXT> * Expand Outside Your Niche - When expanding your niche, products, or services, be purposeful about what you offer. You dont want to give clients so much choice that youre spread too thin or that the quality of your work suffers.
* Get Into Stock Photography - Do some research regarding what types of stock photos are hot right now. If American flag is popular, find ways to take interesting photos of the American flag to capitalize on its popularity. Mix trending needs in with old standards (i.e. landscapes and portraits) so your stock collection has good variety.
* Work With Local Businesses to Photograph Their Products or Services - Try to schedule your shoots with local businesses during times of day when you typically have down time, like the lunch hour or after 5 pm. That way the work doesnt interfere with your regular schedule. Also try to schedule these shoots back-to-back so you can minimize the time spent traveling to and from the locations.
* Work as a Second Shooter - Dont discount the value of what you can learn as a second shooter. Wedding photography is a high-stress gig, and the way that wedding photographers manage that stress and get high-quality photos under so much pressure is often masterful.
* Offer Your Editing Services - When pricing your services, try to balance setting the price low enough to attract attention while being high enough to be worthy of your time. Also think about the time youll spend outside of the task - checking emails, writing job proposals, fielding phone calls, etc. - that will take up time in your day.
* Partner With Insurance Companies - Consider working with local insurance agencies as a photographer as well. Often, small offices require their agents to go out and photograph properties or vehicles, but if your price is right, they might contract with you instead.
* Photograph Local Events - If youre hired to document a local event, dont spend your time tooting your own horn and schmoozing the crowd by handing out business cards.
* Teach Others - If you have portrait photography skills, consider approaching local schools to serve as their school picture photographer. Its a gig that only lasts a few weeks in the fall and can supplement your income nicely.
