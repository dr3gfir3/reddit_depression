	<TEXT> If you are new to DS2 (sounds like you are) I would suggest freely upgrading regular titanite weapons up to +6 and then stopping there to focus on 1-3 weapons to take to +10. You get access to infinite supply of mats for +1-6 relatively early on but on your first play-through chunks are more difficult to get a hold of. +6 is plenty high enough for testing!
Also FYI Longsword is one of the better weapons for PvP and a great weapon to start with to learn the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spears or Greatswords are good for countering opponents with fast light weapons because you outreach them but are still fast enough to recover from a wiff and dodge attacks. In a gank squad scenario something like a claymore would seem better because of it's wide angle attacks? I don't have a whole lot of experience being outnumbered though FYI. When I am I can usually spot the weaker link quickly and focus them down.

But mainly I think the official anti-cheese is... git gud. ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tend to obsessively remake characters and play through up to 150 and then restart so some ideas to try: As melee: 1. Strength build 2. Dex build 3. Quality build (goal is to max both Str and Dex, some weapons benefit equally from both stats, also good way to explore a variety of weapons). To get familiar with different spell types you could do hybrid builds that use melee and casting, like for example a Dex/Int build that uses light weapons like rapier and katanas with sorcery. </TEXT>

They cast multiple buffs, the hex version of hovering soul mass (idk what its called) which has really good tracking, and spamming resonant soul. They tend to be a snore once you dodge all that crap and get into melee but 1 mistake and your dead. I enjoy a skilled mind-gaming caster, I was impressed with one dude using a black witch staff (can cast all 3 spell types) that was fun, but usually they are hacks. </TEXT>
