	<TEXT> What you said is fairly valid but I feel I gave a reason why I feel cheated.  The game sets you up to tactically think and plan with a group of six, only to dump you into an eco system that revolves around a fancy game of Rock Paper Scissors.  

I might check out smogon battles once bank is launched and give that a chance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love Pokemon and I spent a bunch of time building up a box full of competitive Pokemon only to get to the battlespot and realize that Show 6 pick 3 is mostly nonsense. 

Am I the only one that feels like theres a lot of luck (more than skill) involved in this format? I feel cheated out of a good experience and im really hesitant to do so but im seriously considering trading Pokemon in at this point.  It doesnt seem like theres anything here at the end game.  Am I missing something? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there a way for my Family to have healthcare? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi! Ive been out for about six months now and I've been working as an apprentice pipefitter in a union.  I'm able to draw my GI bill each month as long as I work at least 120 hrs in the trade.  I originally chose this career path as opposed to school because I have two small children and a wife that takes a medication that is absolutely vital to her health, so we needed healthcare.  

I've realized over the past 6 months that while this job pays decent (when I have work,) It isn't going to be possible for me to continue on this path.  I don't get along with the people and the work isn't always gonna be steady (there are apprentices going on 6 months out of work.)

I really want to go to culinary school as cooking is my passion and I hope to open a restaurant in the next 5 or 6 years or so, or at least become a professional level chef with a decent income.  My Question (TL;DR) is; Does anyone know of a way that I can go to culinary school, draw my remaining GI bill, and get affordable health care for my family? 

Ty ahead of time to anyone who takes the time to help me.  </TEXT>
