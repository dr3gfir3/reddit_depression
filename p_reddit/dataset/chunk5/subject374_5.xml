	<TEXT> Well, his behavior towards animals suggested that he would be an unmotivated killer, harming others with no reason or rhyme. I was more worried that he would go out into the world and become an obvious threat, rather than being a good heir to my legacy, an investigation into him could have potentially been brought too close to home, sinking myself along with him. 

Being wary of his actions was necessary, he was far too public with his behavior, thinking only of hurting one person and not of who would *see* him doing this harm. Reckless. 

Amanda though, she's on the right track. No one would ever look into her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When the infection began it came with an alert on every platform. 


**THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. PLEASE READ/LISTEN TO THIS ENTIRE ALERT. A MEDICAL FACILITY IN [REDACTED] HAS BEEN BREACHED BY THE WATCHERS. A PATIENT WITH A DANGEROUS VIRUS WAS SET LOOSE. THE VIRUS WILL SPREAD UNTIL ALL AVAILABLE HOSTS ARE INFECTED. WE HAVE NO CURE. ENHANCED GENES LESS THAN FIFTY PERCENT WILL NOT BE AFFECTED. PLEASE STAY INSIDE YOUR HOMES AND DO NOT LET ANYONE ENTER OR LEAVE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.**


It played on a loop for an hour, so much for using any technology to distract myself. The world was already practically over, there's so many things I'll never get to do again, and right now going outside was one of those things. I looked out my window into the endless black sky, it's been black for months. The Watchers thought that would be amusing. It really isn't, it feels like the world has gotten colder since the loss of sunlight, but it hasn't. The sun isn't gone, it's just one of Their illusions. 


The Watchers have done a lot since the Ascension. Originally, they were just a group of Enhanced who were sent to see if we could find other life, or another home out there in the universe. No one ever thought we'd given them too much power. There were 2 billion people in the world after the Great Disasters that killed a majority of the population, and the governing forces of those people decided that we needed to find a way to prevent another Great Disaster in the future. 


The plan they came up with was to enhance the future children. Decades of labor from a species that was slowly dying out proved useful, and they eventually found a way. They injected hundreds of thousands of women with the serum that would create the Enhanced. Many of the women died after receiving the injection, some couldn't live through the gestation of the Enhanced, and in the end only five thousand lived to give birth after 15 months of pregnancy. The Enhanced took longer to cook. The unfortunate part was that not every child ended up being enhanced at all, about 80% of the children ended up being entirely normal-- besides the extended pregnancy. 


The other 20% had Enhanced genes. They would learn faster, be better at almost anything, stronger, faster, slightly longer lifespan, better memory, they were superhumans. A thousand Enhanced children entered the world, and in the last 200 years they have tried to grow more of their kind. Yet again the world was left to discover that not every woman could live to carry something that may potentially be Enhanced, and not every child was given the genes. Our population had plateaued at just under 1 billion, but we knew it would begin to drop again. The amount of Enhanced genetics that have been dispersed through our generations has made every pregnancy extended and potentially lethal, many women refuse to have children due to the risk. 


So many women have died, and so many other people just end their lives each day to escape the fact that we are nearing an inevitable end. The world around us goes on like we're not dying out, bodies are disposed of, the power is on, we live in our homes, we watch television, and we ignore impending death. Forget the fact that any pregnancy has become a potentially lethal condition, or the fact that we made a grave mistake by creating the Enhanced at all, everything just *goes on.* 


Everyone was excited when they announced that they were sending the Enhanced into space to attempt to find us a home that wasn't dying, and killing us slowly with it. They spent months testing everyone to make sure they only sent people with over 90% Enhanced genes. The best of the best, the smartest, they sent all they could find. When several thousand of the greatest Enhanced were sent into the sky, everyone was hopeful. A month later hope started to dim, the Enhanced ship came back and began circling the planet. They didn't send word, they didn't tell us if they had discovered anything that could save us, they just circled and watched. So we began calling the ones we sent away The Watchers.


After nearly two months of silence from the sky, they finally did something. They put up some kind of projection field, and blacked out the sky. People panicked, they thought that they had sped up the End. They thought we had lost the sun, the suicide rate skyrocketed. Then they sent their first message. They *laughed* and told us that the black sky was an illusion. They were fucking with us, proving how stupid the ones who stayed behind really were. It wasn't the first joke they'd pull on us, they seemed pleased to drive the remaining population insane. 


The virus leak is the latest in their sabotage of the human race. The virus was made by those who were highly Enhanced, but not enough to join the Ascension. We needed a way to get back at the Watchers, and they decided to work on a plague that would kill anyone who was over 90% Enhanced. There was less than a thousand of them left down here, they would be collateral damage when the Watchers decided to touch down. Personally, I thought it was a horrible idea. As if the Watchers would be stupid enough to come down while an infection that would end them was floating around. 


As of this moment they haven't perfected the virus anyways, and it is currently lethal to anyone who is as little as 50% Enhanced. That's a lot of people, more than half of us probably. Percentage is an important aspect in our lives, it helps us decide who to sleep with, who teaches us, who does our research. Enhanced are better in literally *every* aspect. It's the reason I'm dating the guy who I can see walking towards my house. For someone who tested 85% Enhanced, he was acting like an idiot. I gaped in shock through the window, he was going to get himself killed. When I opened the door to let him in, I greeted him by shouting, 


Are you brain damaged? The infection will kill you, you're probably dying right now. I frowned at him. 


Oh relax, I'm not dying. If walking across the street got to me, then opening the door would get to you, He smiled and pulled me into an embrace. 


I didn't meet his eyes after the hug, suddenly feeling a little guilty for lying about my percentage. He thinks I'm 80% when I'm only 47%. I couldn't help myself, when I met him last month I could just *tell* that he was above average. In *many* ways. I knew that someone like that wouldn't go for someone with a low percentage. Lying proved worth it though, he was *amazing* in every possible way. He seemed to believe that I was too, so that helped. I was pleased he was here, the infection would make life miserable until anyone who had it was dead. 


The information they'd given us on the medical trials made things clear as soon as testing started. If a patient was ever out of quarantine, the virus would remain airborne for up to a year after the last host died of infection. That means that we were stuck inside for quite some time. Well *I* wasn't, but I was with someone who couldn't know that. At that moment, I had to add Leaving my House to the list of things I might never again be able to do. On the bright side, sex during the apocalypse was great when you had someone Enhanced around, it was one form of entertainment that never got boring. 


As we were finishing I closed my eyes in bliss, and suddenly felt hot liquid drip onto my cheek, and no it was *not* what you're thinking. His sounds of pleasure turned into moans of agony. I looked up at him and was horrified, his eyes were clouded over in red. It leaked from his eyes, nose, mouth, and every single other orifice in his body. I was disgusted, but I couldn't escape from beneath him until his convulsions stopped and his body became entirely still. I struggled to push the dead weight off of me, and crawled out of my bed covered in his blood. 


I showered off and thought to myself that *obviously* it was a bad idea to do that when the possibility of him being infected was so high. I guess I was just hoping that maybe the virus wasn't close to us yet, but my hope was misplaced. I was slightly relieved that after watching others close to me die, that it would never hurt as much again. I was sad that he died, disgusted that it was in top of me, and disappointed that he had caught the infection so quickly, but I would never need to worry about him ever again. He was gone. 


Like everything else that has been ruined by the world and the Watchers, I added this to my *Never Again* list. 


*Never despair over death again. Never see the sun again. Never trust the Watchers again. Never be normal humans again. Never be at the top of the food chain again. Never go on a plane again. Never lie about my percentage again. Never sleep in that bed again.*


Life during the apocalypse is hard, but at least when it's over there will never again be any horror I haven't already seen.

	<TEXT> She's actually quite a lucky one, a first for me. I set eyes upon her after years of hunting, and she was perfect. After a few months in the panic room I realized that she wasn't exactly what I thought, but would be useful in a way. 

You might call it Stockholm Syndrome, but once I let her into the main house she grew to like me a lot, and over time we worked to develop her into the amazing member of the legal community that she is now. She's always been aware that we would one day have an heir to my legacy, and I think she's pleased to have Amanda as a little side project. Nothing quite bonds a mother and daughter like discussions on how to stay out of the eyes of the Law. 

God, I am so thankful for my ladies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They say that the behaviours of a person while they are still in childhood can sometimes indicate that they will grow up to be a serial killer, or a sociopath. It was for this reason that I've kept a close eye on my son his entire life. 


I thought I was doing well as a stay-at-home dad, but little James had some issues that I overlooked. I first noticed him doing odd things when he was four, he found a magnifying glass and was using it to torch ants. I didn't think much of it at the time, I *know* it was cruel for him to do, but I figured it was harmless. Sometimes people can't help playing God, I think part of being human is looking for some form of control in your life. 


When my sweet baby girl Amanda was born it was one of the best days of my life, but it seemed it may be the opposite for James. He didn't take well to her, though it may have been simply jealousy over having to share his parents with a new sibling, he had lived his first five years as an only child. As they grew he developed an interest in bothering his sister. He'd push her around, tease her, but it was fairly harmless. It never really bothered her until he escalated things. 


Amanda was the one who-- between her sobs-- revealed to me that she had witnessed James hurting animals. He had been throwing stones at birds, pulling the tails of stray cats, and apparently he had hit the neighbors dog with a large stick. She thought he was doing it in front of her just to make her cry. Him being nearly 9 at this time meant that he needed a serious lecture. When my wife got home we spoke with him together about how it was wrong to hurt animals, and he seemed to understand and promised he wouldn't do it again. 


He must have hid his cruel activities fairly well over the next few years, because the next time Amanda caught him doing something awful it had progressed greatly. She was 11, and he had sent her an email telling her to look at a video he had made. She came to me entirely distraught, barely able to speak, and showed me the video. It showed him and a female friend in someone's garage with two dogs. The whole things was horrible. 


They got the dogs to fight one another, and when they wouldn't James or the girl would jab them with some kind of taser. I was disgusted, the video went on until one of the dogs didn't get back up. Later that night after consoling Amanda until she went to sleep, I opened the email and showed my wife. She was a fairly prominent lawyer in the town, and her first action was to delete the email containing the video. She didn't want news getting out, but she also knew who the girl was, and where James was sleeping over that night. 


Not one to stand by while something so potentially career and future-life damaging could be circulating, my wife immediately got in her car and drove off. She later told me of what she did. She got to the house where James was supposed to be spending the night only to be told he wasn't there. After a short talk with his friend, she discovered he was actually at a girl's house. She got the address and went there next. 


She said that she spoke to the parents of this girl-- which means she probably yelled and threatened with some sort of legal jargon-- and they agreed that they should keep this quiet. No one wants to ruin the future of their children when they have the option to hide their reckless actions. She spoke to the girl and James, who confirmed that the only video sent out was to Amanda as a joke. They deleted the original copy, and then the email they had sent, received a lecture about animal cruelty and legal action, and James was taken home. My wife spent the car ride home threatening and scolding James for his actions, by the time they got here he seemed to understand that this was the *only and last* time that she would cover his ass for something so serious. 


That was the last incident before he left for college. That girl? He ended up marrying her when he was twenty three, at the wedding they both seemed to be better people. I was surprised when I met her, she seemed really nice, but maybe it was an act. I couldn't quite get over the fact that they had both done such a horrible thing. Something like that doesn't come from nowhere, they had to have done more. I'm know it's shameful to admit it, but when the two sadistic lovebirds didn't return to town after their honeymoon, I was a little relieved. 


The search for them lasted weeks, to no avail. Honeymoon gone sour everyone said, maybe they disappeared together. Maybe one killed the other and ran off, all anyone knew for sure was that they never came home. 


About two months after the disappearance, I awoke to a strange noise coming through the bedroom window. It sounded like someone was in our shed. I grabbed the gun from my closest and headed outside, worried I may be dealing with a thief. When I entered the shed I saw that the door to the panic shelter was open. This was odd and concerning, the door was usually hidden, I hadn't been down in years, and who would go into an underground panic shelter in the middle of the night? 


I started down the stairs with my gun raised, worried I could be dealing with some deranged homeless person who had claimed my secret room as a new home. What I saw when I reached the bottom was a bit of a surprise. There was Amanda standing with her back to me, and there was my missing son and his wife each with one leg shackled to the ground. 


I watched in awe as my daughter screamed at James, Go on, hit her, you fucking animal! When he didn't obey, I watched her jab him with a taser. 


I must have made a sound because James wife looked over at me and cried for help, causing Amanda to turn to me. She just laughed for a second, Well hi dad, what can I say? I found this room and it was just perfect, I know what I'm meant to do! People like them don't deserve to live, they all deserve to be caught and feel the pain they dealt. She smiled as she walked towards me. 


I pulled her into a hug, taking a moment to figure out what I wanted to ask, Honey, is this the first time you've done this to people? She nodded her head. Okay, so she wasn't a serial killer yet, Next time, close the panic room door, okay? I didn't build this room to have someone find out what it's for. She looked surprised, and then pleased. 


Don't worry honey, I made mistakes my first time too.


What can I say, like father like daughter.

	<TITLE> Not Your Average Sibling Rivalry </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-02 20:29:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think when you're a twin you hear a lot more about this supposed twin telepathy. Not because it actually happens to you though, but because everyone *asks* if it does. Well, I don't think it did. As many times as we were pestered by other kids wondering if we knew each other's thoughts, we really never did. Well not more than the average person could know anyways. 


My name is Ashe, and my twin sister is named Willow. Not wanting to be part of the trend of rhyming names, or names with the same first letter, our parents decided we should be trees. They definitely aren't the worst names we could have ended up with, I've heard rumors that our grandmother suggested to name us Beverly and Bailey. I think I'd die of embarrassment if I had to deal with my family calling me Bev all the time. It just seems like a *mom* name, you know? 


Anyways, that's besides the point here. Willow and I were always kind of competitive with each other, even though I seemed to always be on the losing end. Actually, it's not even that *I* was competitive with her, it was that I wasn't allowed to be good at anything unless she could be too. She had to be better. She wanted all of the attention. 


I played soccer? She played it better. I got excellent grades? She'd take my work and either copy it, or pass it off as her own. There was no getting ahead of her. Sure, I knew I was slightly smarter than her, but being in the same classes didn't help. Her being everyone's favorite didn't help either. I wasn't exactly jealous, but I felt constantly disappointed in myself. Everyone overlooked me. We may have looked identical, but everyone could tell the difference. Being better at everything made Willow stand out next to me. 


When we were sixteen things changed for a short time. We went to a party together, and that night I think I realized that my twin sister was truly *evil.* More than just sibling rivalry, she had to hate me. It hasn't been long enough for me to be entirely comfortable talking about the whole situation, but I'll do what I can. We were going to a party together, the kind you have to sneak out of your window while your parents sleep to attend. For once my sister wanted me to outshine her. 


She helped me get dressed, and put on my makeup. She made me look beautiful, while she dressed casually. It's like we had switched places in the mirror. I think that's what she wanted. We snuck out just after 11, a friends car was waiting by the road to take us a few streets over for the party. When we got there Willows ex kept pestering us. He stalked us around the party, and while Willow left me to go talk to other people, he somehow became convinced that I was her. 


At this point I was a few too many drinks in, and I thought it would be funny to play along. I kissed him, and by the time we ended up in a room alone I realized that I had made a mistake. I tried again to tell him that I really wasn't her, but he told me he didn't care anymore. It was enough that I looked like her. Things went downhill from there, and when I saw Willow peek her head into the room, I thought she had come to save me. She didn't though, she watched it all happen, and snuck away before he left me there broken. 


It fucked me up. I didn't know who to tell, my sister watched it all happen and never told a soul, so I did the same. I kept it quiet, I started writing my feelings in a journal, and I became incredibly depressed. It got to the point where my parents actually became concerned, and they took me to a therapist. Though I wasn't ready to discuss what happened the therapist seemed to help somewhat, it gave me an unbiased person to talk to. With my parents so concerned for me, I was actually getting more attention than Willow for once. It didn't last long. 


Within a month things went downhill. Willow seemed to decide that if I got to be depressed, then so did she. She stole my journal, told our parents that it was hers, and they panicked. They couldn't have their favorite daughter turning into the sad little thing I had become. She stole my tragedy, openly talked about what her ex had done to *her.* I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone the truth, I still wasn't ready to admit what he did to me. She didn't hold back though, and things only became worse. 


She started lying about me, she told everyone that I saw it happen and did nothing to help. The entire world was against me, and my parents pulled me out of therapy. They decided that my sadness was actually guilt over not helping my sister, and I didn't deserve to feel better. Life became hell, there was no escape. I got a new journal, I sunk deeper into my feelings, I started mutilating myself just so that I would feel something that wasn't *sadness.* No one cared at all. Though I had lived my entire life in my sister's shadow, this was worse. I was a pariah. Nothing I did couldn't somehow be turned against me. 


Being upset wasn't okay, none of my problems existed, I was branded the liar who was trying to steal Willows problems. They found out I was hurting myself, it must have been because Willow was doing it. Everything I did *had* to be because of her. Everyone believed that I was the one trying to steal her life, her pain. I couldn't be my own person. This went on until after we turned 18. 


The school year was almost over, it was all almost over. I'd be able to leave, finally be free. I could make my own life, I could finally be my own person. I couldn't handle the past though, I needed to do something so that I wouldn't be followed by it. I could only think of one option, I plotted out how I would do it for weeks. It took me awhile to get the courage, but I was going to kill myself. My entire existence mattered to no one, everyone was disgusted by what Willow had convinced them to think about me. 


When our parents found the body, they also found the journal. The journal with *Ashe* written across the front. It didn't contain much, just apologies and the details of a planned suicide. They seemed devastated, but at the same time relieved. Their shameful daughter had done the world a favor. They held me while I cried, everything would be different now. They never believed in all the issues that Ashe had, they never understood that her pain had been stolen and used against her. They would never know. 


I never wanted my sister's life, I wanted my own life. Now I'm the only one around to live for both of us. She took my life in spite, but she didn't realize how much of me she took by stealing my death. 


My name was Ashe, but my sister stole that last part of me when she collapsed on the bathroom floor holding my journal. I finally have my life back, everyone knows what happened to me. Everyone knows how hard my life was, and saw the pain I suffered through. Now everyone calls me Willow.

	<TEXT> Team: **Oblivious Train To Nowhere?**

Working Title: **Last Foster**

------

When I was younger I wanted kids more than anything else in the world, I still do. Children are just little tiny blessings, even when they act like hellions half the time. It was for this reason, when I discovered I would never be able to carry children of my own, that I decided I wanted to be a foster parent.


I was in the system for a while as a child, and I know first hand that not every family a child is sent to is an ideal home. There are some truly vile human beings that take in children. I wanted to be one of the ideal homes, one of the houses that makes you forget the fact that you've been taken from your family, and makes your stay feel like a real home. 


My husband was happy to do this with me, since alternative methods of having our own children were well out of our affordable range. We fostered children for years, and though every child has had their own issues and challenges, I have loved them all. There was one child we took in that was different though, the last child we ever provided a temporary home for. 

Kevin wasn't immediately different than other children we had cared for, but there was always something offputting about him. He was quiet, withdrawn almost. It wasn't uncommon for children who came from less fortunate situations, but I didn't have any solid information about his past. 

For some reason unknown to me, the organization wouldn't tell me anything about him other than name and age. I'm usually always given at least a minimal briefing on a child's past, I have to know what could trigger them. There are always topics to avoid, and different ways to be sensitive to different situations. With Kevin we had go in blind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Notes to self:*

**March 2017:**

**3/1:** Someone from Illinois said that the story isn't logical because they've lived there their whole life and never even thought of pigs.. It's more for cattle. 

??? Wtf kind of observation is that? 

PS: I had to Google Pig Day to figure out what is was, and where it happens. Soooo there's that. 

**3/3:** I just got notified that "Not Your Average Sibling Rivalry" was gilded! It's the first time it's ever happened to me! Super exciting, I didn't even think it was that good o: 

**3/4:** Someone asked to narrate the Sibling Rivalry story, woo! It has also become my most popular story! 

**3/6:** Narration request and gilded on the new story! I adored writing "You Don't Do That To Family"!! I'm so happy that people like my work, this challenge is difficult, but so worth it. 

**3/11:** Posted almost late because I ended up changing from a SSS to a nosleep after making the initial story too long. 

**3/26:** This is so much fun. Got distracted and posted almost thirty minutes late. Appeal? 

In other news, Good Shade is a wonderful success. I'm so happy that so many people are hooked on it, I can't wait to add more to it in the future. 

----

**May 2017**

**05/2:** Entirely forgot that yesterday was the first, so I've already used one appeal and posted two things today. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Last National Pig Day </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-01 14:07:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Have you ever heard of National Pig Day? I never did, until I moved to Illinois in sixth grade. That was the only year I ever took part in any festivities. 


This was a little over ten years ago, I was 12 at the time. My family had just moved down from the U.P to Illinois for my dad's job. We ended up living in a small town nearly an hour from the city he'd be working in, but he wasn't worried about it. 


I'd had the whole school year to adjust to the new place by the time March 1st rolled around. I knew that there was going to be a trip to the zoo, but I didn't know why or what everything else going on was for. I entered school that day to the scent of bacon, it was amazing. The lunch ladies had all pitched in and made scrambled eggs and bacon for the all of the students, even a few teachers joined in on the meal. 


Though we had less than 200 kids, it was still quite the effort they had put in. By the time I had settled down at a table with my meal, my friends had filled me in on this odd holiday, so I kind of understood why we got to do special things. Everyone was mowing down their breakfast, but I only ate my bacon. I passed off my eggs to a friend. I've never liked eggs at all, they've always made my stomach hurt. 


We loaded onto the buses after eating and everyone was excited. The trip to the zoo was supposed to be the highlight of the day. I ended up falling asleep on the bus ride there, and I awoke to find that everyone else on the bus was sleeping too, save for a few teachers who were screaming or crying. I guess Miss Lawrence saw me sitting up, because she came and pulled me out of me seat and off the bus. 


I was really confused and scared at this point. Outside there were a few other kids standing around looking freaked out, the teachers were asking them questions. Miss Lawrence turned to me a lowered herself to my level. 


Amy, did you eat at school today? 


Mhm, just bacon though, I don't like eggs. 


She didn't say another word, just shook her head and escorted me to sit with the other students. I could hear the teachers talking to each other, while one of them dialed the police. 

One of the teachers started freaking out, screaming to the sky asking why someone would do this to children. She broke down in tears next to Miss Lawrence, with one final question, 

"Why did we live, why are these kids okay?" 


None of them ate the eggs.

Theme day: Yellow. Gotta have something about Yellow be an important part of the story. I fucking hate yellow. 

Haha not taking this back but realized after posting this that I have to run a NST, post a story every single day, and finish this damn series I've been working on for a few weeks. 

At least the series will be in approved subs, and will make up at least 3+ days worth of stories if I get around to working on it... 

Anxious and excited, will be a good way to inspire me to keep writing after the challenge while I'm "away" for a month and a half soonish.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw that in theatres only because I was already there and Split was sold out :( 

Now everyone who reads this is gonna die D: You only have to think about the name to have him come and mindfuck you to death. 

I'm making up a monster, right? 

Okay so:

Adam was a regular college guy, until a camping trip changed his life. There was a radical group of devil worshippers who roamed the woods that he and his three younger siblings had planned to spend a little bonding trip for the night. The devil worshippers ended up finding their camp in the middle of the night, forcing Adam to watch as his younger siblings were mutilated and tossed in the roaring bonfire. They finally burned him alive after he witnessed this and received his own torture. The worshippers thought they were pleasing the devil, but they said the incantation to summon him wrong, and Adam did not truly die that night. 

His mangled body roams the woods looking for campfires, but his soul is gone, so anyone at the fire is assumed to be one of the worshippers who tortured his young siblings and damned him to spend eternity in the mutilated and decaying body. 

He was a big guy, over six feet. But the torture left him skinless in spots, his hair melded with his melted flesh, and the incantation did not stop his body from decaying over time, but kept him alive. In honor of his youngest sibling who was only 3, and due the mixed up spell, the last thing you'll ever feel and hear as this hulking grotesque creature comes to cast you into your campfire, is a soft poke in the nose and a raspy whisper of, "boop". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was in September, but that was the contest that they were in. 

I just found it odd that the voice actor would contact me, and then the guy who runs it (I believe he said his name was Craig) was the only one who corresponded with me after that one initial request. Sucks that there was no notification that they decided on another story, but contest-wise I can see how so many actors changing their minds who knows how many times could create confusion and leave an email or two unanswered if they weren't getting all the permissions themselves but instead had to have the guy who runs the show do all the official stuff. 

**Edit:** For reference, this is the email I received: 

Hello, Ms. [My last name],

	<TEXT> The story requested for adaptation was actually not extremely popular, around 400-500 upvotes. Got me excited, but a shame they didn't respond to any of my questions though. Kind of a let down, but they do put out a lot of narrations, so it'd be cool to see it pan out well for another nosleep writer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, let me elaborate on my response, because I can't attest to how shady they may be since they have a fairly large following on YouTube. 

For some reason I don't have the message from the guy running it in my inbox, but I have the message from the narrator who requested to read my story. 

The account was wondercustard which I've looked at and it's pretty blank. But they contacted me asking to read my story for a contest to become a permanent narrator for the channel. 

Looking at one of the two things the user posted, he linked to the story narration. Apparently just picked a different story to narrate for the contest it seemed, didn't watch it, just read the story title that came up a minute into the video. 

By those standards, not as shady, but slightly annoying that they didn't respond when I was checking to see if they were using the story, because I didn't reply to a separate narration request from someone else due to the fact that they never responded if it would be okay for another channel to narrate it (was not sure at the time what the media release would mean) and by the time I realized they were not using my story, it had been weeks since the other channel asked me and I felt bad for not replying sooner, and I don't think they narrated it either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's almost always a slow start, because making something popular is just dumb luck. Most of what I've written goes overlooked, I've had two pretty decent stories, some other mid level and some that sit around with 15-40 upvotes or less. Though I enjoyed writing them all, and think that some of the less voted ones are just as good as my one "very" popular story, it's all dumb luck. I've deleted stories in shame, but I felt worse about throwing away my hard work than I did having it up but unread. 

I have a series "in progress", super slow because I decided "Time-line be damned I want to finish what I started". 

I deleted the second part soon after posting, because I hated that it didn't live up to the first one, I hated the way I wrote it, and I hated that I posted it before I was ready because I didn't want to diaaapoint the ~400 people who upvoted the first part, I wrecked my own motivation. After a couple months I rewrote and reposted, making sure I asked the mods if it was acceptable to do so based on the fact that I had posted it carelessly, too soon, and without enough effort put in at all. Just personal crap put on top of feeling bad that it might not be good. Now it sits with less than 50 votes. But it's *there*. I did it, and I left it open for a new character to absorb the story and continue on when I'm actually ready, votes be damned I love my virus. 

Don't second guess your stories, if you think that the quality of your writing was bad, or you left obvious plot holes, or something that would make *you* not read the story, then I can understand removing and reworking it, but if you thought it was good, and can't find a real issue with it (not counting the fact that most of us hate what we've written soon after it's posted, that issue doesn't count) then leave it up. 

One day you'll hit it lucky and people will be checking back through your posts to get more of you. Maybe those few small upvotes are from fans you've already made. Maybe there's people like me, who share a story with people I know because I think it's great, and it sure would be a shame if it was removed before I could share it. 

Gotta begin with loving the idea and process, post it while it still feels good, and let the rest be damned. Because you did it. 

And hey, I don't have any awards, but think of this: 

One of my stories is in the top of the week with ~2000 votes, a story I wrote two days after, and that I believe is equally good, albiet less twisty at the end, is sitting around with like thirty something votes? 

It's random until you've been around long enough to make a lot of people want to check your every story. I mean I can see how it seems like awards=popularity, but I've read stories from people who have awards that I didn't vote on because I didn't really like them. People who have awards are mostly the people who also have social media for their work, blogs, websites, actual published work, etc. They work hard for it most of the time. 

Not everything that's popular is great, consider the top posts of this current week. Not being rude or anything, but I read the whole series without voting, without being invested, or even really caring what would happen. Wasn't my cup of tea, I spent all week waiting for it to take a turn or get more interesting for me, and it didn't. I didn't really like it. But everyone has their own opinions. 

A story like that might get an award at the end of the month because it was so popular, but I think there's better stories out this month that I'd be sad to see *not* win. 

Yadda yadda I'm rambling.  </TEXT>

Do you read horror? Do you enjoy it? Do you enjoy the horror that you write? 

If yes to all if the above, then you're already writing to the audience and what they like, because you are part of it. 

Doesn't matter how it's recieved once it's out there, as long as you were enjoying the journey to get it there. 

Honestly, the only thing I've noticed about the audience, is they go for titles. Everyone's done it before, interesting title? Yea, let's check it out. But even that is all about you, you're the one putting in the work. And votes don't equal readers :) There are people without accounts who read and can't vote, people who just don't vote, and the random mysterious instant down voters, so you can't always go off the numbers anyways c:  </TEXT>

A light admist the darkest of stories, it rises above the rest, coming to rest aloft the stories written by aching, bloodied fingers. It holds the promise of legends, and it makes the heart ache with longing. Your heartbeat races as you gently tap the link, afraid to scare the tender opportunity away. Then you truly see it. 

Splayed in front of your eyes, the one thing you've been waiting for, desiring, despriately lusting after. You lick your lips as you prepare to hit the comment button, and as you hit the post button you're awash with the feeling of pure ecstasy. 

You're in, you're part of the next round of NST. You have become one with the object of your desire, and it feels so fucking good.

Back when I posted my first story I had put a post in the OOC about something I don't remember, and he/she(? I've never known) read it and liked it (I think? Horrible memory but I know the jingle stuck in their mind). 

My most recent greatest achievement was something that made me literally freak out and tell my family because I was so happy, DefinitelyNotNic had mentioned me in a comment (and a bunch of other writers) linking the story that had made her a fan. There was a little thread that went on with her and someone else about how they liked the story, and it makes me teary eyed honestly.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You never expect something bad to happen when a day starts off as entirely normal. It was for this reason that when I found myself pointing a gun at a seventeen year old kid, I started laughing hysterically, the weapon shaking in my grip. But maybe I should backtrack a little. 


This was a few weeks ago now, but I remember it clear as day. I woke up to the radio blaring some argument about the new president, annoying but average ever since he's been in office. Shower, coffee, accidentally burn myself with said coffee, finish getting dressed, check the time, head out the door. Normal, boring, morning routine. 


I stood near the bus stop waiting, smoke in progress, when a teenage boy shuffled up to the shelter and sat down inside. From where I stood I could tell this kid was already having a shitty day. He sat there slouched, knee bouncing a mile a minute, disheveled blonde hair hidden under a dark hoodie, with a face of extreme agitation. I debated striking up a conversation to see if I could improve his morning, but decided against it. I'm no therapist, and I tend to be overly aggressive and condescending when presented with someone feeling bad over something pointless. So I avoided him, because well, what high school age kid isn't usually feeling crappy about something stupid? 


Not gonna lie, I was also a little freaked out by him. I'm probably only about 5 years older than this kid, with relatively decent looks, but I *look* maybe 15. It's an annoying part of my life that has me IDd and scrutinized for pretty much everything a regular 22 year old partakes in. That's besides the point though, I just really didn't want the kid to get the wrong idea, and then have to let him down during an already subpar morning. He just seemed so twitchy that he might explode if something else messed up his day. 


I can explain my thinking over and over, but it doesn't hide the fact that talking to him might have drastically altered how the next hour would play out. I knew it was never really an option though, because as I stepped on the butt of my smoke I saw another kid approach the boy in the hoodie. The girl seemed to be concerned for him, but he blatantly told her to fuck off as soon as she opened her mouth. She quickly hustled back to the group of students waiting for the bus near the curb. 


Commence the hushed whispers and sideways glances towards the twitchy kid. All I could think was that I despised the fact that I had to use public transit at the same time that these assholes were headed to school. I couldn't contain my annoyance, this is the kind of bullyish behaviour that wrecked high school for me. I muttered quietly to myself, Catty children, like it's the end of the world you got told to fuck off. Biggest news story of the day.


I sighed as I looked away from the group, only to turn and see the boy sporting a small smile in my direction. Apparently I spoke a little louder than intended, but I can't say that I wasn't a little pleased to see the kid perk up a little. Right about then the bus rolled up, and I checked my phone for the time. It was almost ten minutes early, which was rare, but also part of the reason I wait at the stop so far in advance. With thirty minutes between buses, missing this one would put a wrench in my work day. 


I was the last one on, just after the kid. He stopped to give a surprisingly cheerful greeting to the driver, Hey Verin, you're early. Good to see ya. 


The driver impatiently waved him along, Cmon don't got all day here. Need to get this done, now or never. Finish your deal, go sit down.


The kid moved happily to the back of the bus and took a seat. I stood still for a moment, a little confused by the exchange, until the driver requested that I get a move on and stop holding up his route. *That was a drastic mood shift. I wonder how this kid is so tight with the driver, I've been riding the same route every day for two years without seeing him, but maybe he's new. Maybe he drove another route the kid has been on before.* I shook myself out of my random thoughts, and did what I usually did on the bus. I people-watched. 


The blonde kid sat in the back, apparently in a wonderful mood now that the bus was moving. The rest of the high school kids were spread in small groups throughout the bus, some were loudly boasting about the parties they went to on the weekend and parties planned for the next. A few little groups and pairings of girls were whispering, giggling, showing each other things on their phones, or a combination of those activities. There were maybe two or three kids that were just sitting quietly, or reading. After my assessment of the passengers I realized two things; Other than the driver I was the only adult riding today, and I didn't recognize the neighborhood we were driving through. 


The drivers voice came from the speakers just then, Express, express, we're all wasting time sitting on this bus. Wasting time just isn't an option. 


I only had a moment to glance around and see that the a few of the other passengers looked as confused about the announcement as I was. That's when everything went left. The bus sped up, and shots rang out. It all seemed to happen in an instant, suddenly I found myself crowded by the door with the few kids who had been keeping to themselves near the front of the bus. The driver next to us laughed as he continued recklessly down the road. The kid in the hoodie was coming towards us, blood splattered across him as he walked past the slumped bodies of the students he had ended. 


He was within five feet of our small cluster when he raised the gun again, and somehow my human instinct kicked in enough to make me stand protectively in front of the group of crying teenagers. I don't know why you're doing this, but you can stop now. You don't need to hurt anyone else, I pleaded as I stepped cautiously towards him, hands splayed in front of me. 


He smiled, I'm done, then calmly handed me the gun. On impulse I pointed it at him, expecting for it to be a trick. He followed the surrender of the gun by setting himself down in the nearest seat, No, really. My deal is done, you're good. 


This was when my brain decided it was a good time to burst into a fit of laughter. The gun shook in my hand, and I practically screamed, You just shot like fifteen kids, and I'm supposed to be *good!?* I was floored, among other things. How the fuck was this kid smiling nonchalantly after murdering almost all of the passengers? 


Yea, I'm done. Sooo, you're safe for now. We're gonna stop, and my friend is gonna make sure you won't have this memory very long. I just stared at him while he smiled back at me, like I'm supposed to be reassured that someone else is going to finish me off when the bus stops? 


I don't know how I wanted to respond, because that's when the bus came to an abrupt stop. It knocked me to the ground and the gun slid away. I stood up in a renewed state of panic, the driver was gone, and the few kids who hadn't been hit were rushing out the front door. I had fallen near the back doors, and rushed to get up and out, slamming into the blonde killer in my attempt. He gripped me by the shoulders as I stood, and for some reason his last words to me are what chilled me the most. 


Its time to pay Abadin for the gift of vengeance he gave to me. Then he released me and hustled out the doors. 


I followed quickly behind, but turned away from the group and hid behind the bus, using my relative safety to dig my phone out of my pocket and dial 911. I peeked my head around the bus to see what had become of the group of kids, and was surprised to see them all standing calmly beside the bus along with the killer-kid. They were staring off in the distance, and I followed their gaze towards the boy who was now approaching. 


The boy walked casually toward the scene, as though he expected it to be there. He couldn't have been much older than the kid who lost his shit in there, but he had to be at least six foot, sporting semi long black hair, and pale as a ghost. If it hadn't been for the kids also staring at him I would of thought I was experiencing some form of PTSD, this guy was way too calm. It was only seconds before he arrived in front of the group and stopped, but it felt so much longer. 


He glanced in my direction, and suddenly the dial tone I had been hearing was cut off. My phone was entirely dead. It was at this moment that I decided I didn't want to see this accomplice finish off the rest of them, and decided to haul ass in the opposite direction. 


Since then things have been odd, I tried calling the cops and they told me that it was inappropriate to try and gain attention off of this recent tragedy. At the time I had no clue why they thought I was lying. Now I've been watching the news daily, looking for the story on the shooting, but it never came. Instead there was this story: 


17 teenagers from [local high school] have tragically perished in a fatal bus crash. [City transit committee] reported that one of their buses had been hijacked by one of their workers. Police have yet to locate the driver, but have found evidence leading them to believe he may have been working with a student who planned to harm his classmates for bullying him. (Photo of the blonde kid next to photo of the driver). The bus was taken off route and driven off a highway overpass, landing in oncoming traffic. There were no confirmed survivors, other than the bus driver whom the police are still searching for. Please call [hotline] if you have any information on his whereabouts. [Segment including more details and information about the victims].


I'm not sure what happened that day, none of it makes sense to me. I was *on* that bus. No one believes me, and I'm starting to not believe myself. The only conclusion I can draw is that the kid and his accomplice somehow forced the survivors back on the bus, and then drove it to it's end. That still doesn't account for the dark haired kid though, because only the 17 kids I rode the bus with were accounted for. All I know for sure now is that I'll never take city transit again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not *quite* a Siren, merely a derivative. A cross-breed born of a cross-breed. Dealing with other immortals is generally just annoying for me, I am a "mongrel" among the darke world. I might be able to get along with a Succubus, allure against allure. Could prove interesting. 

My mother has faired much better in relations with other inhuman entities, I have only managed to "get along" relatively well with one of them. A story for the future perhaps, he's quite infamous. ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do have a true name, but I rarely reveal it. I am the only one of my kind, my mother is the only one of her kind, but there are many, many, of the beings we derive from walking the earth. 

I have felt true love for a few of my companions, but there was no way to spare them, sadly. I honestly couldn't even begin to account for the number of lives I have ended. 

A true lady never reveals her age, but to satisfy your curiosity I am about 117 years old by human measurement.  </TEXT>

But I figure, if you use alts to post, and also have everything you've written from all accounts compiled (on Facebook, tumblr,  your own subreddit, etc)  then you wouldn't have to worry about the people who enjoy your work finding your stories across different accounts. 

I'm literally just too lazy to make other accounts because I use my phone 99% of the time and don't want to sign out because I don't know my password c:  </TEXT>
