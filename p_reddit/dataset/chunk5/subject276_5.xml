	<TEXT> No worries. I 100% agree that using the word subscribers in that dropdown was inaccurate on Reddit's part, and the word "Reach" would have been better suited. 

And you're right, they don't explicitly say what constitutes as "recent", but calculating the last two months of unique page views + subscribers (plus or minus a few days of data since we're going to assume the number in the drop down isn't a live updating number, and the number of subscribers fluctuates) puts the number within 18k iirc. Not exact, but close.

It could be correlation and not causation, and truthfully I don't know other numbers from other subreddits to test this out (though if you knew and shared with me I'd be happy to look). The other theory that I have is that number is just created based off historical data (looking at MoM +/- in traffic and subscribers, estimating a month's expected data off of the months prior) and may not be updated more than once a month. 

I obviously don't work for Reddit so I don't have the complete answer, I'm just giving insight into how things in advertising tend to work (even though I'm being called a shill by some for sharing industry knowledge lmao). I think you and I both agree that it was definitely wrong to label the dropdown as "subscribers" since that can absolutely be misleading. I do believe that if we were actual advertisers looking for answers to our questions, they would probably be more than happy to explain how they reached that 6 million number. Most advertisers aren't stupid, so Reddit likely has actual data to back up the numbers they used in their original system. 

I'm sorry I don't have the complete answer for you, these are just ideas based on my own experience in the industry.  </TEXT>

Advertisers are not going to just go to a page and dump money into a platform without fully reading what's there. And any advertiser reading the paragraph including subscribers and recent visitors would understand that's the reach of the target.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technically speaking, impressions are not the same as reach. What I was describing in my original comment is reach (since that was what subscribers + recent visitors is), which is the amount of people who can possibly see the ad. Impressions are higher than reach since users can see an ad more than once. 

It seems like they're moving from reach to impressions since that's an easier number to sell to advertisers. Not exactly easy to sell though since they can't seem to get the impression numbers accurate lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think you understand how fraud in advertising works. 

Had Reddit not had the sentence "your ad will be shown to subscribers and people who have recently visited the sub", and had the same number of 6 million solely passed off as subscribers, that would be fraud. In the page explaining how the targeting works, they did not say "your ad will only be shown to subscribers" and then display the same numbers. 

Mislabeling a headline in a drop-down while still being very clear about how the number, on the same page directly above the demo image, is calculated is not fraud. Not even "one of the most basic forms of fraud out there".  </TEXT>

The page that discusses exactly *what* the numbers are (the one I've linked that was last edited yesterday) directly states how they get the numbers.

	<TEXT> Does no one do even the slightest amount of research? This took two minutes to find. 

The number shown reflects who will see the ad, which is comprised of subscribers AND people who have recently visited the sub, regardless of subscribing or not. 

[It's in Reddit's advertising information](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204584279-Targeting-Subreddits)

It says "subscribers" in the drop down which is wrong and shady, because the number is reflective of subs and recent visitors. They probably could have replaced the subscribers part with something less deceiving like "Ad Reach".

Edit: Feel like an idiot that it took me so long to find this, but you can actually see the traffic patterns in the subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/about/traffic). If you take the amount of unique visitors from this month and last and combine with the amount of subscribers, you're right around the number reflected in OP's post.  </TEXT>

www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/michael-flynn-negotiating-with-intel-committees-seeks-protection-lawyer-says  

Flynns lawyer, Robert Kelner, verified that talks between Flynn and both committees are taking place

Flynn has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit, Kelner said in a statement.

	<TEXT> Main points: 

- Yes, there is overwhelming evidence that backs the claim of the 1,000 people hired to do this.

- 2016 was the first time that Russia used both hacks and leaks together against a country during the country's presidential election. Previously they have affected elections of other countries with just one or the other.

- There is clear evidence right now that Russia is attempting to influence elections in Europe. 

- The last month of the US 2016 election would have looked much different had Podesta used two-factor authentication 

- Russia may not have intended for their influence to go this far, though it appears that they certainly capitalized on it. 

- As far as WikiLeaks goes, we've probably only seen 1% of emails stolen by Russia. 

This has been going on for a few hours and there is much, much more to it than this.  </TEXT>

Don't forget to check out Accam :) he's one of our longest standing players on the team and will probably be much more successful this season with a proper squad. He's on Snapchat and it's pretty hilarious sometimes. 

Might be speaking too soon, but I definitely think we have a decent chance at playoffs this year. 

For Fire info, there's a Chicago Fire app you can download or you can just follow them on social media. Emails are usually pretty decent too.

$150 is the highest I've seen for a Fire jersey in a long time. Even the kid's is $95. Usually they're no higher than $90-$100, I think.   

Also, your English is great. Don't sweat it.

In the past, the school had a larger budget to cover some of the expenses themselves. Almost 90% of the students come from low income families, so they aren't necessarily able to buy them on their own. 

As for why the kids "need" rings, they will likely survive without them, but it's a pretty neat thing to remember a once-in-a-lifetime achievement (for most of these kids) by.  </TEXT>
