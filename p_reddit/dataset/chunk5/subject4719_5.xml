	<TEXT> No, "normal" people do not tend to feel like that. Although my "normal" friends have experienced depression (triggered by life events). Unfortunately, we are stuck feeling this way. A disorder is a disorder, cant really fix that. We can only learn to cope with it and lead the best quality of life that we can.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are so many wonderful pedagogical books out there, but I haven't come across many books about teaching mathematics in a high school setting. Anyone know any? Google only gave me three relatable options, the rest were middle school related. 
Thanks ahead of time! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I relapsed on my self harm a week ago   I can't find the motivation to stop again.  There's not even a good reason for this self harm. My head keeps saying "stop" and I keep answering myself " I could if I wanted to" but.... I don't want to   I don't know how to want to stop again.  I feel like I regressed in my progress. Maybe tomorrow will be better.  Maybe tomorrow I'll find a reason </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last year I taught seniors and I was only 6 years older than them by the end of the year. It was hard at first,  but they quickly understood that I was not like them- that I was a teacher/mentor and not a friend. I think what helps me is dressing professionally and holding myself like I was older (or at least pretend to in my head lol). I think this year will be easier,  got seniors again!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tripped on acid several times in my life   each time I feel less depressed for a few days after. I don't think it's any more of a treatment than smoking weed. However if you had someone guide you through your trip, I think that might be very helpful!  </TEXT>

Don't be afraid to ask your colleagues questions:) love your good kids, love your bad kids. try not to stress (but you will   that's fine)     most importantly: have fun!  Enjoy your job the best you can.  You will improve each year that you work! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> self harm is an addiction </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have hurt myself on   off again since I was 13 (25 now). Lately it's more slip ups than anything,  and my last one was in January. I feel like an addict. I think about hurting myself as a solution to everything,  even though I know it's not.  Im pretty sure I have a self harm thought at least once a day. Sometimes I even fantasize about hurting myself.  I know I can fight it off, I'm just so upset I still get these thoughs and cravings. That I still slip up.  I feel like an addict,  begging myself to do it even though my body and brain know it's a bad idea.   I refuse to slip up again, but God sometimes I really want to.  </TEXT>

The rest of the time I get away with converse high tops lol I know it looks silly being dressed professionally with them on,  but they're my comfiest shoe!  I had a pair of Clark's that were super comfy, but I sweat a lot so they made me smelly. However I've heard wonderful things about Clark's!!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Simultaneously Happy and Depressed?!?! </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's so strange to feel this way.  Pretty much everything in my life is amazing. Amazing relationship, great friends,  Independent living,  self confidence,  dream job. I am happy with how my life is,  yet my depression remains.  It's exhausting.  The irrational urges to cut,  the sudden dives into darkness. It upsets me that I still have to suffer from it.  
Is anyone else stuck being happy with life, but still being tortured by depression?  It's such a mindfu*k. Does it ever transition into just happiness?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter how old you are, expressing feelings is hard and nerve wrecking. Doesn't make you a loser.  If the people I dated didn't open up to me first/text me first/express emotions first,  I'd still be single.  It's tough.  It makes me feel vulnerable in a scary way.  Your feelings are valid,  coming from a 25 year old who still gets excited when her significant others text first  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right about anti depressants helping with anxiety.  When I took medication that's what I did.  Now,  remember that some medication can take a little bit to kick in,  so don't be discouraged if/when it doesn't start helping right away. I think you should give it a chance and see how it can help you!  
Medication and I didn't work together very well,  but that's *me*. I gave it a long fair shot too.  I have friends who have benefited from meds,  I wish I could have too.  
Good luck!   </TEXT>
