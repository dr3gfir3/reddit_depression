	<TEXT> The whole Mike storyline feels very forced. The fact that we know he eventually dies drains every suspense from his sub-plots. IMO the show should focus entirely on Jimmy with perhaps a new side character similar to Mike for the underworld storylines.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On chapter 2 of Toll the Hounds Spinnock recalls how Silanah had killed some Crimson Guard and Mott Irregulars in Mott Wood and how she had been wounded by a character named Cowl who I don't think I've met yet but I might be wrong. He recalls Rake's hunt for Cowl and the ensuing battle of sorcery.

My question is, weren't the Mott Irregulars fighting the Malazans? And weren't the Crimson Guard in alliance with Rake seeing as how they're with Caladan Brood? Why then did Rake fight this Cowl for? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also the fact that the series peaks at book 3 and then drops in quality for the next two books doesn't help. 

This is why I always recommend ASOIAF fans the Malazan series. You know that a series is damn good when almost every fan ranks all the books differently. For some book 2 is the best one, for others book 3 or book 5 or 7. It makes for a better reread, when the whole series is a steady incline in quality. </TEXT>
