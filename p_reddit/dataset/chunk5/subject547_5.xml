	<TEXT> Rick is a little taller than me, I am 5F10.5i
Rick is a 6th of a foot taller than me in total, now morty is about 3F smaller than rick and about 1.5F smaller than summer, summer is taller than Beth in this universe because it's not the original one from the pilot, and it makes everyone smaller except for the natural redheads, so unity looks a little big.
