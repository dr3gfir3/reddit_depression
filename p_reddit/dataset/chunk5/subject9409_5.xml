	<TEXT> The methodology: "We analyzed a total of 200 films for this report: the top grossing (non-animated)[2] films of 2014 and 2015, as reported by Variety. Findings for 2015 are presented here, and findings for 2014 are included in Appendix C. We use the GD-IQ, a revolutionary new automatic audio-visual tool  the first of its kind developed specifically to analyze media content."

The automated tool used to compile the data: "GD-IQ is the only software tool in existence with the ability to measure screen and speaking time through the use of automation. This revolutionary tool was co-developed by the Institute and led by Dr. Shrikanth (Shri) Narayanan and his team of researchers at the University of Southern Californias Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL), with additional analysis from Dr. Caroline Heldman."

The findings: "Male characters received two times the amount of screen time as female characters in 2015 (28.5% compared to 16.0%). In 2015, male characters spoke two times as often as female characters in the top box office movies (28.4% compared to 15.4%)." </TEXT>

Then you can bring it into your hospital or practice. Most new health technologies are "discovered" once they are proved through a study at an academic institution. 

Some products in highly regulated fields are almost beyond marketing. I think a kickstarter was a bad choice for marketing this crutch. It's a B2B product, and they should have gone directly to the hospitals or the academic institutions that could provide social proof + get the right approvals.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the BBC: "Twitter has announced it is to close its video sharing service Vine about four years after it launched.
Vine let people share six-second-long video clips that played on a loop.
Twitter did not give a reason for the closure, but earlier on Thursday it announced it was cutting 9% of its workforce following slow growth of the social network.
"In the coming months we'll be discontinuing the [Vine] mobile app," the company said in a blog."

If you use an analytics tool like Crowdbabble, you'll probably note a drop in engagement rate and average follower growth on that day. Be sure to note the attack if you report out to clients or colleagues, so it's clear that the drop wasn't due to a flawed strategy or bad tweet on your part.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys! We're testing out a new feature for brands on Instagram and I thought I'd give away a few trial lists. First three people to reply will get one (API limits = can't provide for everyone). 

The lists capture the Instagram users who like or comment on a post from a particular account. I don't think this list would be useful for personal accounts - it was built by Crowdbabble based on a request from a marketing agency. Use cases:

 * Comparing the engaged users list to your follower list, and figuring out what percentage find your content because they follow you vs what percentage find your content in some other way
 * Planning an interaction / outreach campaign to those engaged users with the list
 * Contests (like/comment to be entered in...)
 * Understanding who is engaging with your content in general

Let me know in the comments to this post. First three is the most fair, I think. I'll then PM you to get the post URL that you want to look at. 

Edit to add: Sorry for the confusion! This feature is hard to explain. I can generate a list of users/people who have liked and commented on an Instagram post - some of these people will be your followers, some will just be randos who found your content. Those are two different list types (https://www.crowdbabble.com/download-all-instagram-followers/).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are your goals? 

What number of clicks through to your website would you need to meet them?

Working backwards and then shifting the proportions dedicated to paid advertising, SEO, and/or content/PR/influencers/whatever else should help you find a holistic strategy that you can afford. 

Once you have your goals and the number of clicks you need, you can calculate costs on each social platform and with Google Adwords. If 1% of your web traffic converts, then you need 100 clicks to get 1 conversion. If each click costs about $2 (on LinkedIn, for example), then to get that one sale, you're looking at $200. 

There are other ways to drive traffic other than paid advertising, obviously. SEO, content writing, etc should also be part of your plan - you should figure out how many backlinks you need to compete with your competitors (semrush is great for this), and how many blog posts you want to publish per week. You can estimate costs from there.  </TEXT>

To find new hashtags, I look at what competitors are doing. They kind of function like keywords for social search, so I also use Keyhole.co to check volume. It takes a while to compile, but the sample stats are great.

Once a month I'll also download all Twitter followers for Crowdbabble's account and see what hashtags they're using (the download also pulls each follower's most recent tweet). If I want to really zero-in, I'll sort the followers by influence and see what our most influential followers are using.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dell was innovative with its factory-direct pricing. Cut out the middleman and disrupted the industry (from Reinventing Dell). More recently, AirBnB is a good example.

The key search term for you is "disruptive innovation". Clayton Christensen's Disruptive Innovation is a good book to read on this subject.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Marketing can create demand. Just because your 100 people disappeared doesn't mean that other people don't want your tool. I'd suggest continuing development, and building a landing page with a Sign Up for Beta Testing subscribe feature. That way, you can collect people and their emails before you roll out. 

Your school and professors are also great resources to help you develop the product. Professors in the entrepreneur program will be more than happy to check out your business idea and give you advice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, the Instagram API does not allow you to track mentions easily. You can track hashtags - so that should be the easiest. It's easier to get users per hashtag on Twitter than it is on Instagram, but you could do either. 

You'll want to set up your analytics before the campaign begins. Essentially, you will need the names of all users who use a specific hashtag - and then you'll cross-reference these lists to see which users used the most hashtags. No one has to register before using a hashtag. I'd make sure to put up a big poster with the hasthag and the contest info in each location to give people an incentive to post. You could also require two hashtags: one for the specific location #locationcontest, one for the contest in general #contest. You could then just count the number of times people use #contest, and go through and check to ensure their posts are set up well.  

What sort of volume are you expecting? How many hashtags/locations? You could just count all the posts manually for each hashtag and make your own lists. Or, you could pay an analytics service to do this. I work for Crowdbabble and we create custom lists like this all the time. You could also sign up with a hashtag tracking tool if you're going to be running more hashtag campaigns in the future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys! I've been posting my writing from Crowdbabble here for a while now and to thank yo u for reading, I wanted to give away some free follower lists.

The lists can be generated for any Twitter account with fewer than 1 million followers. You could get your own, your competitor's, whoevers. The list comes with 20 metrics per follower, including influence, latest tweet, location, and device. The lists are normally an additional charge for Crowdbabble customers, and they'll be a free part of our platform in a few months. 

Do you work for a marketing or advertising agency? Reply to request your list and I'll PM you so I can send it to you over email. I'll just go with the first three to reply to this post to make things easy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need a plan and a content strategy in order to do social media well. You also need a plan in order to defend yourself: you can say, "that's not in the plan."

One of the things that's annoying about social is everyone thinks they can do it. I once had someone tell me that no one schedules content and if I did, I was an amateur.

Develop content themes, make a content schedule, and stick to it. Have an open planning session once a month where people can pitch in their ideas - and then do not take much feedback outside that meeting.

One of the best things you can do is use numbers to defend yourself. Do you use social media analytics? I work for Crowdbabble, and there are a bunch of metrics you can use to direct your content strategy. The most commonly used one is top performing posts - you can see which posts perform the best for your company and your competitors, and use that to inform your content strategy. When people question your strategy or make suggestions, you can counter with: "sorry, those types of posts didn't perform well. Here are the numbers."

	<TEXT> Do you want to do this just once? What network? 

Most analytics services provide fan location for Facebook - the social platform tracks this in their API. Instagram does not share follower location with its API, just latest tagged location. On Twitter and Instagram, many users do not enter their real locations - they write things like "wherever the wind takes me" or "my boat". That makes the location metric tricky. 

I can't think of anything free, but there are options where you can download all your followers and sort them by location. Crowdbabble provides a download of all Twitter followers that includes two versions of location for each user: the location stated in their bio, and the tagged location of their latest tweet (if available). It's not free, though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you guys published a Moment on Twitter yet? If you used Storify, you'll already know the basics. Moments make Twitter a content platform like Buzzfeed and Tumblr most of the Moments I've seen so far have been listicles of funny tweets. 

**What are they?** Moments allow you to compile any tweets from any account into a single story or list. One key difference between Moments and Storify: you can't add descriptions to Moments. The order the tweets are in / the tweets themselves have to explain themselves.

**How do I make one?** I wrote up two guides, a short version and a long version. You can find a step-by-step with pictures here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/how-to-make-a-twitter-moment/ Pro tip: it's a lot easier to copy and paste the URLs of the tweets you want to use, rather than try to find them within the Moments interface. You'll do too much scrolling. 

Here's the short version:

 * Login to Twitter
 * Navigate to the Moments interface: twitter.com/[yourusername]/moments
 * Select Create New Moment
 * Choose a title, description, and cover image
 * Use the four search options within Moments to find and add tweets to your Moment
  * Tweets Ive liked
  * Tweets by account
  * Tweet search
  * Tweet link
 * Organize your Moment using the up/down arrows beside each tweet
 * Publish and share

Hope that helps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry that you're being discriminated against. You sound very knowledgable and like you've prepped a lot for these jobs. 

Isn't this illegal? Are there any organizations that can help you understand how to combat this stuff? 

Failing that, I might explore marketing and sales jobs in government or at universities or non-profits.

	<TEXT> These are tough metrics, but you can find them. Twitter does not record age or gender, so those "easy" ones can be hard to suss out - not impossible. 

Let's imagine that all 300,000 followers are following 100 accounts themselves. That means you're actually looking for a 300,000 master list, and then 300,000 smaller lists - adding up to 30,000,000. If your client wants an Excel sheet with **30 million rows**, they're going to have to pay for it. 

Crowdbabble can do this. The analytics platform provides lists of followers with 20 metrics per follower, including influence, latest tweet, and location.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great job on those interviews! I've written a series about people who have accidental virality - their audiences are typically too broad to be sustained with their content, so they quickly fade over time.

With you, your readers are deeply interested in your brand already. You have to figure out what they like. 

What are the demographics of the people who read your HuffPo and La Repubblica pieces? See if you can find anything out. Check your Google analytics: what affinity categories and demographics show up?

Then, refine your content strategy to strike while the iron is hot. Push out content that they'll like - and get them into your funnel. How does your funnel work now? Do you have a newsletter, a way for them to opt in without buying? Are you giving away a trip to Italy if your Instagrammers sign up to your newsletter and follow you? That would be huge for them. Also, I'd suggest getting some social media analytics here to track your growth - I recommend Crowdbabble (where I work - I am biased), but you can also do it manually.

Finally, create a relationship with InStyle and HuffPost Italy. Reach out to the journalists, thank them, ask them follow up questions, ask for intros to their editors, stay in touch.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope OP reads this. It's very insightful. Probably belongs in the sidebar.

I'm very much against universities acting as job training - smart students can train themselves, and education should be much more theoretical and adaptable (in my opinion). I worry that all of these 'bootcamps' actually just teach tools, skills that expire quickly. </TEXT>

That's not apparent when I load the page. You might think of adding some more user experience-driven features that are different paths based on different needs. "I want to improve my career" or "I want to help my community", leading to different resources or events.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Competition + oversaturation. 

Use your alumni network and connections. Applying online in creative industries is mostly pointless. 

Edit to add: to fill the gap in your resume, do some free work for local nonprofits.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What demographic would buy these cars? How can you reach them? 

Craigslist, Kijiji, local auto resources are probably where it's at. You'd just have to be careful not to tarnish the luxury brand - give this business a new name.
