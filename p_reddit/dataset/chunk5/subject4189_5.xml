I'm trying to say that the finish will serve a purpose to the overall story

	<TEXT> Prediction: AJ will win this Sunday, but due to either a small package (to emphasize that he's a better wrestler) or by cheating and using a weapon against Shane. The AJ fans seem to forget that he's a heel whenever you discuss this match with them and don't want to accept that they need to find a way to keep heat on him going forward while still making Shane look strong.

Yes, believe it or not, they will want to keep the guy who is known as the ultimate risk taker and someone who took Taker to the limit last year (so much that Taker showed him respect, something he rarely does) looking strong for when they use him again </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do people actually believe that all seven members of The Nexus were destined for superstardom or something? Let's have a look at the group:

- Wade ended up doing pretty well for himself despite visa + injury issues plaguing his career; was a relevant player for a decent amount of time. He got to remain relevant after the supposed burial, going into a full-blown feud with Cena after Summerslam. He certainly wasn't ruined by the result of the Summerslam match, but rather he was 'ruined' by bad luck with timing and injuries that came long after The Nexus was dead.

- Heath Slater went from a ginger with long hair and nothing else particularly interesting about himself... to being repackaged in such a way that he was able to actually develop a personality as the OMB (after TMB, of course). Getting Heath away from Nexus was the best thing that could have happened to him.

- Skip Sheffield went from a mediocre power wrestler that didn't cut a particularly good promo and wasn't particularly exciting... to being repackaged as Ryback and having himself a pretty decent top level run. Getting Ryback away from Nexus was the best thing that could have happened to him.

- Justin Gabriel was a vanilla pretty boy that didn't have much more than a 450 splash going for him. In The Nexcus, Justin Gabriel was a guy that got his one cool spot per show, and that was about it. It's hard to argue that he had a superstar career ruined by the Summerslam result.

- Michael Tarver was legitimately a terrible worker and terrible promo, and should have been kept in developmental for a lot longer. His release was pretty unsurprising, as he wasn't particularly good at anything other than wearing a bandana over his face. Nexus was going to easily be the high point of his career... so you could probably argue that the Summerslam loss killed his otherwise-poor career.

- David Otunga was legitimately a terrible worker and marginal promo, and probably would have been released years ago if not for his relationship with Jennifer Hudson. Otunga actually got better after the Nexus loss at Summerslam, as he began to open up his personality (with some very erotic Cena segments...)

- Darren Young was just another guy in Nexus, and so Summerslam didn't really ruin his projected career path whatsoever.


What people don't remember about the Nexus is that it was essentially a vehicle for Wade Barrett to get a main event run; it wasn't about elevating seven guys at once. Wade was the only one that was supposed to get a rub out of the Nexus, and it allowed him to work a four-month program with the top star in the company.

In reality, The Nexus did exactly what The Nexus was supposed to do. If anything ruined The Nexus, it was when CM Punk took over the group and then Wade went to SmackDown for the shitty retread of The Corre. </TEXT>

That shove at Survivor Series and his 'what the fuck look' after was amazing and when he got eliminated from The Rumble and looked like he was going to cry, epic.

	<TEXT> What he means is the pay should be based on performance, work rate, and tenure. It's a fair point. Look at it through his perspective, not only did he make less guaranteed money after getting shuffled down the card, he also made less merch money (because he wasn't as prominent in the storylines, and also heels sell less merch than faces.) That stuff is largely out of a guy's control - you do the jobs they tell you to do and then your paychecks shrink because of it.

He's elaborated this more on his podcast but people just cherry pick the clips from that and act as if all he does is bitch. He doesn't. He's actually a pretty good dude who loves his fans (talks about positive faninterractions al the time), tells old backstage and on the road stories, and gives his take on current events </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Brock's entrance] (https://youtu.be/IxXLF4T3mSs) is one of my favorites. Dude felt like a gladiator. And the ovation when he jogs out is incredible. And this was the first match that [Heyman started doing Brock's ring introduction] (https://youtu.be/7lCmW9t2_GM)

I loved the build too. I remember Heyman said in an interview that they were going for an old school boxing feel to this whole match. I also loved the red lighting they used over the crowd </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To make a special attraction? Yeah. I get what you're saying. But I like that he wrestles sparingly. It feels like a big fight when he finally does. I don't want to see that end. It's what made this match so awesome 

He also wrestled a fair number of house shows. Definitley more than 3. During the lead up to Mania last year he was wrestling the League of Nations quite a bit every other weekend for a stretch  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He pretty much has a deal that he prefers. I would like that too, but Brock has been very open as someone who while he likes a crowd reaction and is a tremendous performer it's not worth it to him given all the travel and throwing his head at the ground anymore than he has to. He gets to do that as little as he wants for the most money he can get. Who wouldn't  want that? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just rewatched One Night Stand 2008 and noticed a cool subtle detail during Batista and HBK's Stretcher Match </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-27 06:30:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> During the match whenever Batista looked like he had Shawn beat,  Jericho would come out and try to cheer on Shawn. And all it would do wasn't make Batista inflict more punishment on him. 

The first time he comes out was after Batista lays him out with a Batista Bomb. All this does is just make Batista hit him with another one.

The second time is when Batista all but has the match won as he's dragging a damn near lifeless HBK on the stretchers over the line, and Jericho come and out again only to stop Batista but more so cheer Shawn on again. This only pisses Dave off, who the new proceeds to grab the steel steps and proceed to spinebuster HBK on them, incapacitating him and winning the match.

When I was younger and watched this live I thought Jericho's role in this match was so awkward and weird as he didn't deliberately interfere. Now I realize that this match took place a week before the infamous heel turn when Jericho through Shawn through the Jeri-tron. **Jericho is passive-aggressively goading Batista into hurting Shawn a lot more than he needs too.** I don't know if I'm reading too much into this or just late to the party. But this is pretty masterful storytelling and a great and rare example of foreshadowing in wrestling </TEXT>
