	<TEXT> Wasn't what I was originally looking for, but I LOVE Judo too. I love the acrobatic throws and submissions too. Like the sacrifice throws. These are some awesome defenses for throws that I'm definitely gonna work on. I liked the defense for the Seio Nage. Looked like he defended with a Cartwheel Kick </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Have any examples of acrobatic techniques? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm in love with the acrobatic techniques and am able to effectively use them in sparring (TKD). I need MORE!

Do you have any other examples of acrobatic techniques? Bonus points for an example video/gif.

Techniques I utilize often are the superman punch, jump back kick, exchange jump roundhouse, jumping roundhouse, crane kick, jump hook kicks, jump spin kicks, tornado kick, tornado back kick, flying knees, question mark kick, capoeira roundhouse, cartwheel kick, skipping front/roundhouse/side kick, and recently, I ended up using a spinning superman punch by attempting to set up a flying spinning elbow that I saw in a video. He moved to my left, so I extended instead of the elbow. 

I realize my list is extensive, but I would appreciate any new acrobatic techniques you may know of. I enjoy learning new things and figuring out how to apply them in combat. I'm especially lacking in acrobatic hand and elbow techniques, so those would be especially appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any ideas for Christmas HP gifts? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've got a good friend who, like myself, is a big Potterhead. She's 15, I'm 18. I'm trying to come up with an awesome HP gift to get her that'll blow her mind. 

Problem: she hates it when people spend a ton of money on her. So the gift needs to be inexpensive. 

I was thinking about a sketch (I'm a pretty good artist) of something from the HP universe. 

What do you think? Any other ideas? </TEXT>

I got her a beautiful polished blue stone from a gift shop, and one for myself. I gave her hints like, "Small, blue, and two of them."

Her: "My mom said it's your nuts, and you got kicked and that's why they're blue."

Me: "-_- yes, tell you're mom I'm giving you my blue balls as soon as I get home." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People with Aspergers are not assholes. We can't help the fact that our brains were wired differently. It's like blaming a person with Down syndrome for being stupid. It's not their fault. 

Yeah, it's hard to empathize with someone, but part of it might come from simply not understanding why it's necessary. When I learned how awesome empathy is, I couldn't get enough of it! I felt connected to everyone!

I personally believe a true asshole is someone who chooses to be one. An Aspie was born with a differently wired brain. They didn't choose that. But, with encouragement from loved ones, an Aspie can learn how much fuller life can be with empathh </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always found that sprawling and sinking in a guillotine is the best defense for the double leg takedown. That, or use the Bale Sacrifice Throw. When they go for the double leg, grab them around the waist, fall back, and use the momentum to throw them. Also, if you keep rolling with them, you'll end up in dominant mount.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is your specific fighting style? I'm not asking for the name of your art. I'm asking how you implement it in combat. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Example: The way I fight in Taekwondo sparring matches focuses greatly on the more advanced, unorthodox techniques. Jump back kicks, wheel kicks, wheel hook kicks, etc. I've also adopted different striking techniques from other arts. Cartwheel kicks, Superman Punches, etc. Pretty much those things that most people say are difficult, if possible, to use in combat. I fight like that because it works for me. And I've won several tournaments thanks to being unorthodox. 

Then there are other people in my Taekwondo organization that really focus more on hand techniques than kicks, even thought TKD is often known for its emphasis on kicks. 

I mean to say that every martial art has it's own style, and then each practitioner has their own adaptation of that style. Some block and counter strike. Some push the pace. Some constantly attack on the ground, keeping the person from doing anything but defending submissions. 

What's your sub style? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My grandparents visited Germany once. Said it was an absolutely beautiful country. The only problem was they were VERY strict about rules and social norms. 

Grandma and grandpa came down for breakfast in the inn, grandma picked up the knife and buttered her bread. She put the butter and knife in different places than they were before. An old German woman who she says to this day might be Hitler's sister came up to her and shouted in a *German* accent, "THE BREAD GOES HERE! THE BUTTER GOES HERE! THE KNIFE GOES HERE!"

Grandma nearly shit herself. It's one thing to be shouted at, but it's another thing when it's in a German accent. It's so guttural. It was a big culture shock for her.

Remember kids, if that girl you're nuts for won't give you the time of day, try kidnapping!

Cashier: "A can of what?"

He proceeded to do the crane kick and I proceeded to lose my shit.

	<TEXT> I (18) went to Subway with my little brother (9) and my mother (none of my business). Brother orders a 6 in. Ham and cheese. I was feeling especially peckish, so I ordered two footlong steak and cheese sandwiches. 

Mom's turn. "Nothing for me."

Realization dawned on me at that moment of how expensive my order is. We're not poor. We're not rich. We're upper middle class. Still, two footlongs are expensive. 

In the car, I talk to her, I say I'm sorry. I essentially took my mom's dinner from her. All because of my bottomless pit stomach. She said she was fine. Happy that I was full, but shocked that I could eat that much. I feel horrible :(

TL;DR: I took two feet from my mother.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good questions. The way I see it, I'm *using* my impulses. I learned to control them in this regard. And really it came down to the training. The muscle memory I developed. 

Most people's reaction when they see someone throwing a bunch of fists at their face is to cover up their face and back up. That's their impulse, whether you have ADHD or not. I sucked at first. Like everyone does. 

I am a very physical learner. I know if I'm doing something right if I can *feel* it. It took a lot of training to get to the point where, when someone throws that left jab, I move my feet to the left, center block with my right hand, and counter with a left of my own. The first time I did it correctly, I was like, "I felt that!" 

Yeah, I would sometimes run into the punches, but every time I sparred with a partner, I got a little better. I was rewiring my brain to only follow the good impulses. The split second decisions that let me get out of the way. I wish I could do that with my mouth lol. 

The twitch of the muscle is something I noticed after a fair bit of practice. I thought, "So if that muscle twitches in that direction, then he's throwing this strike. So what do I do to avoid it?" 

I would analyze it. Just like how in a classroom setting, while the teacher drones on and on and on, that mechanical pencil beckons to you. "How does it work?"

After analyzing this-this-this-this, I would put it into practice. I would never think this during sparring. I would be thinking about it after classes. Usually, I remember very few details about my matches. What I do remember, I analyze the shit out of. 

The hyperfocus comes into play during sparring. Usually, for me, my brain skims over all the info around me until I find something very interesting. A person kicking me in the head is pretty interesting lol. Keep in mind I'm also medicated, so I have a degree of control over my focus. I can narrow it to where I'm analyzing everything about what I choose, if that makes sense. 

I'm constantly moving, so I'm using this extra energy to be evasive. It's only when I don't set my feet right that I slip. 

It's not that they're the opposite of what the symptoms are. It's looking at the symptoms in a different perspective. So often, people think about the negatives of ADHD. But there's good and bad in everything. It's how you look at what's been given to you that defines you </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-11-18 18:43:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I use my ADHD to my advantage in a huge part of my life: martial arts. 

ADHD is possibly the perfect thing for a combat athlete to have. I have Inattentive/Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD. The Inattentiveness actually works well when I'm fighting. 

We all know how it is. Our focus is constantly shifting from one thing to another. We notice the tiniest details about everything. Well, it's surprisingly easy for me to focus during a fight because of all the stimulation going on. My focus is on my opponent. All of him. I notice things that others simply don't. I notice the way their body moves saying they're about to throw this kick, or this punch. I notice the twitches of their muscles saying they are going to initiate an attack. I notice their eyes dart to my head telling me they're going for a head strike. 

The hyperactivity helps so much in sparring as well, simply because I have an incredible gas tank. I'm constantly moving around the other guy, not breaking a sweat because I'm so used to constantly moving. 

The impulsivity means I have good reflexes. It's just a matter of training my muscle memory to do what needs to be done without me thinking. Using my impulsivity to react faster. When I fight, I never remember anything that happens. My brain simply works too fast. 

ADHD can be a tool. You just have to find how it works for you.  </TEXT>

A while back, I showed my ex some basic techniques because she was curious. She was having a lot of fun with it. I had a boner the whole time. Good thing it wasn't Jiu Jitsu I was teaching her. She definitely would've known then, and maybe a little weirded out (we never had sex). 

I think part of it stems from me being in love with both her and martial arts. The two of them together= insta-boner </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very interesting questions my dear internet stranger, lol. 

First one, about the literal interpretation. I was born and raised Catholic. I believe in God. I believe in Jesus. I believe in the Holy Spirit. However, I did a lot more thinking about my religion than the rest of my class (Catholic School) did. In fact, between preschool and 8th grade, when the priest came in for religion class, I would always ask the most questions. The rest of the class would just read from the book and nod. The priest once told me that no one else in the class could seem to follow my train of thought on matters of morality, faith, etc. He could, because he heard most of my questions before, but some even stumped him. 

My Catholic school was very open to the idea of discovering your faith. Yeah, there were the religion classes to help with that, but they also had books in the library on things like Greek, Roman, and Egyptian culture. I was fascinated by these books because they were so foreign to what I was taught, yet so similar. 

I have a very good sense of self. And I've discovered that, yes, I believe in the Holy Trinity. I believe that God the Father is Love in it's purest form and that Love is what created everything (but not in six days. I'll get to that later). I believe Jesus is Love incarnate. Jesus came to help give humanity a push in the right direction. I believe the Holy Spirit is the Love that we feel towards our fellow human beings. I believe the Holy Spirit is what gives humans hope. Gives us joy. Gives us a sense of what's right and wrong. 

However, I recognize the fact that science is true. But honestly, I see no reason why science and religion can't be friends. In fact, science is just our way of understanding the world God gave us. We're all human. We're all curious. We want to know more about nature. When humans study the world around them, they are learning more about God. 

I realize that Love is a series of chemical reactions in the brain. That doesn't mean it's not real. In fact, there's your confirmation of Love. Love does exist. Therefore, God exists. Because God is Love. Love is what makes the world we live in a little better. Imagine if we couldn't Love. Life would suck. It would be truly meaningless. People are constantly searching for happiness. That happiness can be found in Love. If it makes people comfortable to not think of Love as God, then fine. As long as you're living a life of Love, however, in my book, you're living the life God wants you to. God wants you to believe in him. In Love. 

I don't believe God created the world in six days. However, since God is eternal, six days in his time could seem like several million years to us. I believe the timeline of the universe is accurate. I just think God is manipulating everything behind the scenes. Example: Big Bang meant God decided to set up fireworks to celebrate the creation of a new world lol. 

He manipulates these parts of nature, but gave living creatures free will to choose. So he might make that hurricane happen. But how we respond to it determines what happens next. Humans can shape history just as much as God can. 

So, I do believe in some parts of religion literally, but more like the philosophical parts. The "science" of religion was something I had to discover myself. 

As for me being the person I am without religion, I am not so sure. The most liberating moment of my life was realizing that my choices affect who I am. I made all the wrong choices when I was younger. I was a very troubled kid. Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, and Asperger's syndrome. I couldn't feel emotions very well. I was miserable all the time. I nearly committed suicide in fourth grade. 

I would love to tell you Jesus came down and sat next to me and told me everything would be ok. He didn't. I was truly miserable. I cried out, telling God to take all the pain away. I shouted out that I only wanted a friend, for it was something I didn't know anything about. 

I got my first friend two weeks later. She was so patient with me. She helped me through a lot of stuff. It was about my sophomore year of high school that I realized, "Holy crap, God gave me her."

My faith had a big influence on me growing up and developing into who I am. I always believed in God. I just thought he hated me. But now I've grown a lot closer to God. To Love. Because of all the shit I've dealt with. I don't think I could've psychologically made it through my childhood without having something to believe in. 

TL;DR: I say the word Love a lot. Also, fuck depression </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those people that never heard of Jesus could have been amazing people anyway. They could make it to Heaven. So long as they live their life of Love (man I sound like a broken record lol). Jesus has some good teachings. Love everyone. Well, these people in America could have figured it out for himself. From what I know of their myths, for the most part they had a code of morality similar to the one Jesus taught. Maybe God did reveal his Love to them, but in a different way. Not through a preacher, but through their experiences.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe it stems from fear. People are afraid of the unknown. That's a part of human nature. So how do you make it familiar? You come up with an explanation. They explained the forces of nature with personifications, or gods. 

These explanations later made them think, "Maybe if we get on the gods' good side, bad things will happen less often." 

Thus began the practice of sacrifice. Also, the moral code began to develop. Humans naturally have some level of morality. But these religions gave a little more structure to it. Societies with similar morals would survive longer. Subconsciously, humans realized this. 

These beliefs began a long game of Telephone. Details were added in and taken out. Add in the different languages and several thousand years, and you have a mess of religions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's because they realize that God is a benevolent being. Yeah, horrible things happen. I believe God causes them to happen. However, I don't believe it's simply to be malicious. I think it's because he wants to bring out the best in people. If we were handed everything, there'd be no reason to strive for greatness. 

Let's think about that doctor doing the surgery. His life might've sucked. He could possibly have lost his father to heart disease. Maybe this spurred him to be a cardiologist? He spent countless hours studying in college. It sucked horribly. Lost so much sleep. His roommate kept him up all night with the girl he brought over. He failed some tests. Maybe some more deaths in the family. Maybe some heartbreak. Maybe he was so preoccupied with his studies he had no time for heartbreak. 

He goes through so many trials. Probably much worse than what I'm saying here. But it's all worth it. He saves this kid's life. And it all started with his dad's death. 

I think subconsciously, the people in your area realize that God is responsible for the bad things that happen, but these bad things can lead to the good. It all depends on how we as humans choose to live our lives. That doctor could've just as easily given up on his life and been a bum. But instead he persevered. God has a plan for everyone. It's up to us to decide if we want to follow it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see nothing about hate in that quote. 

"He who does not gather with me scatters"

"He who does not gather with Love scatters"

I interpret this as Jesus using the word "gather" kinda like a farmer gathering the crops. Crops are good things. People are the crops. Gathering people to live a life of Love by showing them kindness, and not shoving it down their throats. "Scatters" is like when you do shove it down their throats. People GTFO. Or when you are horrible to people. You psychologically affect them to the point where they might just give up on a life of Love </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that's where it gets really tricky. I'm a big believer in choice. Everyone has the right to choose. They can choose right. They can choose wrong. And sometimes they don't know if it's right or wrong till after their choice. The best thing to do is to learn from it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! The extremists aren't real Christians. I have no idea how much I've said this in this thread lol, but you're a real Christian when you love everyone. We are all sinners. We mess up. It's part of human nature. The thing is that you become a better person when you acknowledge you messed up and try to do better. And I'm pretty sure Jesus said, "Be tolerant of everyone" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much :) I think people really should take these beliefs about loving everyone simply for the benefit of being happy in this life. I could care less if they believe in an afterlife. Even if there isn't one, then you were an awesome person anyway </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My belief of God and Love being synonyms fits very nicely with this. Loving God can simply be by loving everyone, because you're living the life God (Love) wants you to. 

I'm not sure if Jesus ever said anything about enemy. That implies hate. That's definitely the opposite of what Jesus preached. 

"Anyone who isn't for me is against me" can be rewritten as "Anyone who isn't for Love is against Love" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe actions speak louder than words. If someone sees you being an awesome person, they'll think, "OOH! I wanna do that!" That's probably the most effective way to get "converts." Let them choose for themselves. 

More than once, I've thought, "There should be a Church called *Our Lady of Be a Good Person and Do Your Best*. Forcing your beliefs on someone alienates them. Being a good person is contagious. 

As for that last paragraph of yours: I personally love the idea of loving everyone. That includes gays. Discriminating against people isn't what Jesus asked anyone to do. Whether they think people should be aloud to have a gay marriage, that's their opinion. Keep it to yourselves. If gays wanna get married, whatever. I just won't get a gay marriage. Just cause they're gay doesn't mean they're a bad person. 

I personally believe abortion is stupid. Whether you believe the embryo has a soul at conception or not, no one can deny that an abortion destroys something that could've been a human. In my book, that's just like murder. Birth control I'm cool with. But once the egg and sperm meet, I think that baby has a right to live. 

That last point about education, look up on Askreddit that one thread from a few days ago. It's about people who were in cults. It's very interesting. You're right. Some people just were uneducated because their religion forbade them from learning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely right. These beliefs evolved over many years. I accept that. That's why I personally take my beliefs from all the sources I can find. A lot of influence comes from my Catholic upbringing. Like the thought of God being synonymous with Love. So I prefer to believe that Heaven is more of a state of being after death. Like the soul is at peace because that person lived a life of Love. Hell is choosing hate over Love, thus the soul isn't at peace. 

I love the idea of Jesus's original teachings. Love everyone. This is psychologically healthy. And if it turns out there is an afterlife, I choose Love, just like in this life </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, I believe that in the ancient Jewish culture, if someone killed in battle or touched blood, they'd have to spend like a week outside camp as both penance and a psychological way of dealing with the fact that they killed someone. So it wasn't really "ok" (at least in that instance) but more like necessary </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I won't lie: I'm not big on going to church. The point of Church is to worship God. You can do this simply by living a life of Love. I previously stated that Christians for the most part believe God and Love are synonyms. So it's technically possibly to be a good Christian by living a life of Love. The life God wants you to live. No Church necessary. So even an Atheist could make it to Heaven if they lived that life of Love because you're doing exactly what God wants you to. Of course, the Atheist would go, "Oops." Upon reaching Heaven, but so long as they're a good person, no harm done </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ??? Is there a religion that actually says sinning is ok if it's under God? If so, you're right. That is ludicrous. 

The definition of sin is a choice of action that rejects God. It's impossible to sin under God simply from that definition. 

Also, sin can be defined another way. For the most part, Christians believe God is Love. The two are synonyms. So sin can be defined as rejecting Love. Anything that doesn't spread Love or that furthers hate is sin.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please don't use harsh words like that. I understand you must've gone through some shit. We all have. I don't know your life story, and I'm not gonna ask. But just know you're not alone. 

I've gone through some real shit too. I nearly committed suicide in Fourth Grade. Was bullied my whole life. Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, and Aspergers Syndrome diagnoses from a young age. 

I've dealt with the only two loves I've ever had deciding they don't want to be with me. I've seen my dad suffer through cancer. I've lived with guilt. I'm only 18. I know it's gonna get worse from here on. 

But making the most out of your difficulties gives you the chance to say, "Suck it Life!"

ADHD? Joined martial arts. 

My only two loves decide they don't want me? Decide that I love them enough to want them to be happy. 

Dad has cancer? Remember all the awesome things he does for me (Plus I can get him stocking caps for Christmas) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a lot more similarities between the different religions and science than you are letting on. I love looking at all religions and piecing together the similarities. Example: Judeo-Christian tradition, Greek/Roman myths, ancient Egyptian beliefs, most other mythologies, and Science all agree on one thing: the universe was created from nothing. That, or from Chaos. 

The Big Bang brought Order to that Chaos, God created everything from nothing, Gaia arose from the depths of Chaos. 

If you put in the effort, you notice many similarities. Most mythologies have a story reminiscent of Noah's Ark. And I believe I read somewhere (don't have the source) that science agrees there was a dramatic flood at some point in the Earth's history. So clearly this flood must've been something serious that people are still talking about it. 

Even if you don't believe in these religions, just doing the research is interesting in and of itself </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We really took for granted how much Dad does for our family. The possibility of him being taken from us created the opportunity for us to grow closer. And we took it. 

Being able to rebound from a horrible event makes a person stronger. I believe God throws these horrible things at people because he wants to see us succeed.  </TEXT>
