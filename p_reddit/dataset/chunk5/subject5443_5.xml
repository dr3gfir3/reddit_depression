	<TEXT> Speaking as a Kerryman who's been living in Cork for ten, it's a great place to live.  People are warm and friendly, it's easy get know them and make friends.  Wilton is surburbia but has shopping centres and all that for convience.  I live near the city centre and there's a great vibe in there.  Easy to walk around, plenty of different types of pubs, clubs, cafes, a few theatres and cinemas.  I suggest joining clubs with your hobbies and interests to meet new people you have something common with.  You'll have a great time, they're good people here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really wish we could choose Danny Boy as our national anthem.  Could you imagine how powerful it would be with a ful stadium singing it?  It's an emotive and lyrical song, which would suit us.  Maybe if Ireland is ever reunited, it could be choosen.  The tune is the Derry Air and the lyrics were actually written by an Englishman about his son that he lost, so it suits our mixed up history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suspect the memorializing the heroic sacrifice of the soldiers that died in that war is a way of nullifying criticism of the war and the elites who engineered it.  They did die serving their country, but it's rarely said their lives were wasted in a futile war brought about by the hubris and stupidity of the ruling classes.  Really I feel there should be outrage at the loss of life in WW1, not carefully manicured sentimentality.  But maybe I'm alone in this, I don't know.

	<TEXT> I'm Irish and a music lover and one time I refused to stand up for the national anthem played at the end of the night in a pub purely on the grounds of musical taste, I think it is a bad tune, it annoys me, we have much better and more emotive Irish songs that aren't a hymn to an ambush driven by military style drumming.  It's just a bad bloody song.  I don't think the people standing giving me dirty looks could intuit my reasoning but at least no-one said anything to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe I'm alone on this but I can't understand why Liverpool didn't/doesn't sign Begovic from Stoke.  The rumour was he was available for about ten million at the time they bought Mignolet.  I consider Begovic one of the top three premiership goalkeepers of the past few seasons along with Czech and De Gea.  The man is a machine.  He also makes saves you wouldn't expect a goalkeeper to make pretty regularly, like in one on one situations.  

The problem with Mignolet is his decision making and judgement.  He's always misjudging corners and flapping under them, also goes when he should stay and rarely makes a save you wouldn't expect, though his reflexes are top notch.  Not so sure how good Begovic is at commanding his area as I usually only watch stoke on MOTD, but I've rarely seen him make a mistake that lead to a goal.  Can't understand why he isn't more highly rated/sought after.  Maybe I should have a word with Brendan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's a case of the straw that broke the camel's back.  People knew after the crash they were going to have to absorb a lot of pain in the coming budgets and did so with little complaint.  The tax burden on the average family has doubled since the crash.  People are pinned against a wall.  Then meter's started being installed outside people's houses, bringing home the reality of this new tax. There's a widespread suspicion it's set up to be privatized in a few years.  Either way people are convinced prices will rise and rise year after year if it gets off the ground. There is also a feeling that the rich are never targeted and aren't paying their fair share. Added to it is a stream of stories of the incompetence of Irish water and the excessive salaries paid to it's employees.  People have had enough, the torch paper has been light and the fire is going to burn down a lot politicians careers. </TEXT>

The you can find lots of guided meditations online or on spotify, give it a try.  Also, if you have religious ocd, a positive healthy faith is important, believe in a God of love who understands your illness and protects you from it doing you real harm, God is more powerful than any fear.  Medication has also helped, but it is palliative rather than a solution.  Pm me if you want to talk more about it or you just need someone to listen, I'm happy to help. </TEXT>

Now they're pregnant, another huge consequence for a teenage girl.  I believe in compassion and I believe in forgiveness.  Their whole lives shouldn't be destroyed because they were niave and made a mistake. </TEXT>

Obviously they were brainwashed and promised the world online and niave enough to believe it.  Now they seen the truth.  They could actually be used as proganda weapons by the west, if they are allowed to return home and are interviewed about what life is really like over there, it may stop some future kids joining up. </TEXT>

Do you think she would see that as reasonable?  She seems to need your life to be only about worshipping her and is very controlling in order to get it that way.  Try to get her to put herself in your shoes, maybe she will see she is being too demanding of you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I often feel like I want to cry but I can't, I have the idea that childhood inhibition as a male is the reason.  But recently I realized that although I do want the release and healing that crying brings, I don't want to feel or embrace the upset that causes it.  I guess if you want one side of the coin, you have to accept both. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read something when I gave up drinking that helped me - Surrender is the only escape.  It's a Buddhist phrase.  When I was having a bad day, when I felt like shit, I would want to drink to change my mood.  When you can't drink what are supposed to do about this shitty situation/day/mood?  Accept it, it is the only way.  Once you allow those feelings in, instead of trying to escape or suppress them, they will stay around a while and then move on, like storm clouds in the sky.  It is a much healthier way to deal with difficult emotions, you work your way through them, it is healing.  It teaches you to come to terms with yourself and your life, you learn you can handle it, you don't need the escape of drinking.  Drinking is a crutch that cripples the walker. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I can relate to what you said.  I have mental illness and was suicidal for a long time.  I fantasized about death as an escape from my suffering, but I was too afraid of going to hell to ever do it (which I'm glad of).  I have ocd which manifests as an obseesive fear of evil, so I too have had 

failures of moral and ethical thinking

as well. I've seen Medusa and it turned my mind to stone.  What can I say?  In the end we have to forgive ourselves and try and be better than we were in the past.  Life is an amazing experience and it's a shame to waste it on misery and regret, we've got to figure out a way to enjoy life or die trying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't develop it until I was about 24.  I became depressed after partying hard for a few years, doing drugs and wasting my life.  I became completely disillusioned with myself, to the point where I didn't believe in the person I always felt myself to be until then.  A fear overtook me, if I wasn't who I thought I was, who was I?  Who was going to become now?  Was I going to become someone evil?  The feeling of depression made me think my soul was gone rotten.  I started reading the bible to learn how to live properly, but all I could see was condemnation and I became convinced I was going to hell.  A particular line where Jesus says something like 'you shouldn't even imagine being with your neighbour's wife because it's the same as doing it' (I'm paraphrasing) convinced me to think a sinful thought was the same as committing that sin.  I thought, ok, I must not think any sinful thoughts.  Which of course, sparked them off.  Everytime I had a violent thought I freaked out and tried to suppress it or pulverise that part of my mind.  All this just made the thoughts stronger and more persistent.  

I wonder if I done things differently, if I hadn't gotten so out of control, if I had got better help, if I hadn't read bible, would I have been ok?  I'm nearly forty now, it's been a very difficult 16 years, although I have gotten a lot better.  I also appreciate that OCD forced me to become a much person through all the changes I made to try and get better.  I hope to leave it behind, someday soon, I live in hope of getting better and leaving it behind. </TEXT>
