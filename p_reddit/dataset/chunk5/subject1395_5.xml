	<TEXT> For cocktails, the Still and Stir is kind of expensive, but they'll make you almost anything. For "girly colorful drinks", I mean, check out most restaurants that have liquor licenses? I personally go to Nick's on Milbury street, and they'll make you fun drinks without grumbling if it's not busy. Best bartenders in the city (as far as being great guys). Armsby Abbey is pricy but has an amazing cocktail menu, though they don't generally stray from it. If you want shitty colored drinks, curacao/midori/etc, check out some of the sports bars on Green St.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted this on the last thread, but I have more information this time:

I have a pair of Sennheiser HD280 Pro 64 headphones that I'm trying to use with my computer. I have been experiencing some static in the right ear, and have been completely unable to fix it. I use a Sound Blaster Omni USB amp/dac thing.

Initially I connected the headphones right to the back of the case, but my motherboard audio jack started to fail. I tried the case-front jack, that one gives me coil whine. Bought the dac and it mostly fixed the issue, but now I was just getting a slight static.

I went so far as to replace the coiled cable on the headphones with a straight one, and I still have the same problem. Is this something to do with the higher impedance? Or an improperly grounded outlet? I think this happened in my last apartment too, so a bad power supply even? Help?

**Update** - I grabbed a pair of Senn HD598CS for $99 on black Friday, and they are exhibiting the same symptoms, but these are 23, which is a lot more average. 

Also tested Bose QuietComfort 15 (73), those have NO static. 

Tried disconnecting powered speakers from the Omni, maybe the static got quieter? Hard to say for sure. Maybe I need a ground loop isolator? 

Any insight is hyper appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tried a hidden alignment cleric once in a 3.5 one-shot. Of course I flavored him as the [cigar-smoking crow from Dumbo](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/a/a9/Dumbo-disneyscreencaps_com-5644.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110531023806) (raptoran) and gave him a crazy voice, so my party was kind of expecting the Death Throes self-destruct.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had them for a few years now. It's definitely possible the drivers are the problem. They are a textured membrane style, so they might be worn out.

	<TEXT> I have a pair of Sennheiser HD280 Pro 64 headphones that I'm trying to use with my computer. I have been experiencing some static in the right ear, and have been completely unable to fix it. I use a Sound Blaster Omni USB amp/dac thing.

Initially I connected the headphones right to the back of the case, but my motherboard audio jack started to fail. I tried the case-front jack, that one gives me coil whine. Bought the dac and it mostly fixed the issue, but now I was just getting a slight static.

I went so far as to replace the coiled cable on the headphones with a straight one, and I still have the same problem. Is this something to do with the higher impedance? Or an improperly grounded outlet? I think this happened in my last apartment too, so a bad power supply even? Help? </TEXT>
