	<TEXT> I like how instead of green screen, they just cut the film from the rebate and pasted it onto it's background for each frame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My biggest compliant is the second screen does absolutely bupkiss. Total waste of a decent idea. I cannot tell you how much I wanted to be able to use that thing for item usage and selection. Instead it's just draining my battery to let me know "hey, you can play this game at 720p on a tiny screen... If you want." The controls are hard enough to get used to (I'm still not - I call my horse all the time by accident.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's gotten to the point where even Reddit front page memes are from 6 years ago. Does this mean internet culture is a cyclr or is it stuck in a groundhogs day type dealy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. My content is much better than a top 10 video, a reaction video, a fake prank, a Minecraft let's play, an unboxing video, a YouTube drama alert, a talking head about the current events or some half assed edited down twitch stream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm on post 9/11 GI Bill and full time student. I cannot fail any college course or I have to pay the money back (which I don't have because I'm a student). I got partnered with a deadbeat last semester who threw me under the bus and claimed I took over the project, which I did, only after I Lt became apparent she didn't want to show up to anything. Fmr?!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's a matter of getting it out there and getting it seen. Not saying that the static image isn't "enjoyable" however, if you can crank out about 100 episodes of those in the time it would take 1 of much higher quality (perhaps something with a budget, props and actors, sets, etc.) But since the market is FLOODED with absolute crap and YouTube can't tell the difference... Whats the point? He's right. I was doing the YouTube thing for years as a micro budget film maker and gave up on the platform altogether. It's impossible to trudge up that hill when it's filled with so much garbage content. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She did and she returned it. I told her I beat that one a decade ago.  It's out of stock everywhere in town so... I guess it's gonna have to wait. </TEXT>
