	<TEXT> Hi, 

I'm Zach. I'm 21. I love to talk and meet new people. I haven't had much time to meet or talk to someone and actually get to know someone. On top of that, I haven't really had much luck finding someone who actually holds a conversation. With that being said, I'm a nice guy and would love to have a friend. If you're interested, you can either reply on this post or send me a PM. Thank you for taking your time to read this. Have a great day! :)
