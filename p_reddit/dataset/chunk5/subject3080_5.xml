	<TITLE> 2016 October Book Discussion: Arguably: Essays by Christopher Hitchens Part 3: Amusements, Annoyances   Disappointments </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-08 20:04:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Part 3 of Arguably starts on page 389 with the 'controversial' essay "Why Women Aren't Funny", an essay taken out of context by folks that didn't bother to read or understand it and tried to paint Hitchens as a misogynist when in fact he is a champion of women often stating the only true cure for poverty is the empowerment of women.  

One of my favourite essays from this part of the volume is probably the one on Victor Klemperer. It lead me to picking up a copy of his diaries, and also writing an essay (as yet unpublished) on Victor's life under the Nazi regime. 

Enjoy folks. Apologies again for the delay.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a Trump supporter at all. I'm considering moving back to the EU if he's elected.... but I have to say this:

I see a lot of hypocritical shit here, and online. Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broderick in the 70s. Christopher Hitchens documented this in his book No One Left to Lie To. I've spoke with Juanita about the incident as well. Hitchens makes the claim that there's two other women. Bill bit the face of Juanita when he pinned her down before raping her. Bit her cheek.  

Juanita told me that Hillary came after her, threatened her. She claims the secret service killed her dog and sent threats to her. She lived in fear and still does.

Now, Juanita is a big pro Trump supporter, which I am not. So we don't see eye to eye politically, religiously (I'm atheist), so this isn't some pro-Trump bias.  

Hillary supporters going after Trump over his 'grab her by the pussy' comments is ridiculously hypocritical. I'm not saying Trump shouldn't be roasted over this - he should resign and this should have come a long time ago.... BUT Pence is a thousand times worse than Trump. And that fucking terrifies me.

Pence, Trump, Hillary. THEY ARE ALL FUCKING AWFUL. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chipping and putting did it for me. And being consistent off the tee. On my lowest rounds of 70, 71, 72, 74 I hit every fairway, and never putt more than twice. When I needed to get down in two (if my approach shot missed the green so I didn't hit the green in regulation) I got down in two, with a good chip and a putt.  

Your short game is key, but it's also very important to be in a good place from your initial drive as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When the Ryder Cup was in Europe, fans cheered and clapped as American players were teeing off or taking shots. It was white noise. There wasn't shouts of "YOU MARRIED YOUR FATHER" or "Suck a dick!" or "YOU'RE GOING TO MISS!" when players were standing over a ball.  

You can't equate the two honestly, either. What we've seen the last few days is being caused by roughly 0.10% of the 50,000 there (50 folks or so). 

It sucks that the US players are having to police the crowd. It sucks that the commentators are focusing on it as well. On Sky Sports you don't hear it as much as the volume from the crowd microphones are lowered way down. Maybe that's what should happen in the future? Mute the microphones before/after a shot and only allow us to hear the club being swung. Maybe feed us a 10 - 15 second delayed feed so crap can be removed?  

This is the unfortunate result of golf becoming popular in a country currently going through nationalistic rise with Trumpets feeling emboldened and racism on the rise as well.

Ryan Moore is gonna fucking destroy Westwood, so we'll definitely be relying on the young lads. Europe has come back from worse, which has no relevance here but should inspire the lads.

	<TEXT> He said the cheers from the pro-Nick Faldo gallery when Azinger landed in the sand on No. 18 didn't bother him. It was so un-golf-like a reaction from the crowd that tournament chairman Alister Low publicly rebuked the fans afterwards, saying, "I'm sorry about the unsporting reception that Paul Azinger received at the second shot on the 18th hole."

Nobody here is complaining about this. Show me the fan that shouted "YOU MARRIED YOUR FATHER" at him. Show me the fan that shouted MISS before he took his shot, or during it.

Both sets of fans seem to be cheering when someone misses. That's not what the gripe is here. We are all annoyed at the behaviour when a player is about to take a shot, or is lining up for his shot. 

Big difference between that and people cheering when a ball goes in the sand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do feel for the proper golf fans in the states. Must be embarrassing as well. This is what happens when a sport gets popular unfortunately. You wouldn't have seen this in Arnie's day. This all started after Woods revived (a much needed revival lets all agree) the sport. The lads heckling players that are standing over balls aren't proper fans. I won't let them claim to be either. </TEXT>
