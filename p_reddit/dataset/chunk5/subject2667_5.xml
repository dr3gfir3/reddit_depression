	<TITLE> Keeping Up With the Joneses Review </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-24 18:47:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Did Any one watch the movie? I dont understand why it flopped in the box office , I thought it was a decent comedy.


Keeping Up with the Joneses has this great nostalgic feeling, a kick back to those wonderful 80's comedies that fuse action and humor, while actually making you care for what the characters are going through. It's a bit of the oddball The 'Burbs with elements of classic spy flicks like True Lies or Mr.   Mrs. Smith. Zach Galifianakis is hardly recognizable, after shedding most of his weight, but he still keeps his iconic lovable every-man persona intact. He's also one of two things that keep Joneses moving in a smooth pace, with his perfect timing and hilarious delivery making way for tons of good laughs. Isla Fisher does a decent job at portraying Karen Gaffney (opposite Galifianakis's Jeff), a 40 something mom leading a rather dull life in suburban America, who finds her semi-average life challenged when a new couple moves next door. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Snipet is from hearing  of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old [shirley lynette ledford](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Shirley_Lynette_Ledford_Sunland-Tujunga_1979.jpg). These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake "Hollywood" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trailer- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxPApTGWwas

With the plethora of mediocre historical series out there, I did not expect much from this show. I, however, was utterly blown away by how compelling it is, and by the excellent acting by all. The subject matter is fascinating, and it depicts well the harshness of living, and surviving, in a barbarous world, with an emerging, equally barbarous "new" religion. The casting was terrific. The actor who played Scorpa, the Dane of the White Horse, was beyond fierce. An unforgettable presence. I was especially, impressed by the lead, Alexander Dreymon, whom I had never seen before. As the series progresses, you really see this guy's acting chops. His range is from the tender to the ferocious.  

  The characters and the actions are well developed, the landscapes are amazing, the dialogue is also incredible. Everything is just outstanding and introduces the viewer in the period which the show represents. I'm so happy i gave it a shot and I want it so badly to continue for at least a couple more seasons. Oh, if only more series would be as good as this one, but unfortunately it's really hard theses days for a show to stand out, considering how many there are out there. So all I can really say is The Last Kingdom is a masterpiece so far and it really should be continued. Well done with the casting and the director is really good.

And yes it is better than History channels Vikings. No matter how much I like the latter.


If you watched it and like it you can vote for it to be nominated as it has been shortlisted for this years National Television Awards for Best Period Drama

	<TEXT> Granted it isn't your traditional English Houmor that is more subtle and humble, I guess it's one of theose shows that you either love or hate. Like [The Eric Andre Show](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheEricAndreShow) in the US but being as unconventional as it is Celebrity Juice won 7 awards including 2 BAFTA's  (more than most panel shows) and is on its 16th series  so it obviously has a following... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Different strokes for different folks then, I watched my first episode with tears of laughter streaming down my face. It  is hilarious because the guests are put through some of the funniest stuff I have ever seen! My only negative is the continued use of Jedward, but the games in which they are involved are mildly amusing and Keith often steals the lime light. I like the character Keith Lemon, he is funny, risky etc and i think if there was a different host, it wouldn't be celeb juice anymore, he would be missed, no one is as risky as him. It is not just him being funny, it is the things he says, they shock you, you wouldn't expect someone on TV to say the stuff he does so you laugh in shock. It makes a change from programmes being so serious and professional, c'mon it is good to see a show where celebs can be themselves and have a laugh instead of being stuck up and boring. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happened me to 2 years ago, I was going to catch a train from asmara (Eritrea) to another town the next morning.Me and my dad had to talk to the city administration about my great grand fathers properties which included 3 factories, a hotel, mills and a cinema and houses in the capital that was nationalized by a communist government, but we couldn't get it back because Ethiopia and Eritrea separated afterwards. Anyways I was with my dad and I told him I'll take the next train tomorrow because I wanted to stroll in the city and it's beautiful architecture. I saw this really beautiful lady wearing red dress and a white scarf, kinda weird because every body was coming from church mass and every one was wearing white. I followed(stalked) her for a couple of long and twisted ailes like the onces inmedieval Italian cities, I saw her making a left so I started walking and made a left too , it was a dead end, there were no houses no nothing and she was gone, I was really perplexed. any ways I toured the city afterwards It was getting dark so I got a room at this old Italian built albergo, I got a keys to my room, I shut the door, locked the keys, set my alarm and went to bed. The next morning I was a going to catch my train when suddenly there was a lady in red sleeping next to me. It was the creepiest shit that's happened to me mostly because the door is still shut from the inside and there are no windows and I had seen the day before. I was going to wake her up and ask her questions but I was going to miss my train. I jolted out of there real quick.

	<TEXT> indie movie I saw, I think it came out in 2010's maybe 2014. I cant quite remember the plot. But it was about this guy , I think he checked into a hotel and notices this rich young girl in a swimming pool who liked him. afterwards he along with her and her friends gathered for a drink and later he told her he has a wife and she told him she doesn't care who he goes out with as long as he is with her. I am sure there is a lot to the story and I just wrote a whole lot of blubber but that is all I remember. Me and my friends were talking about it but for the life of me I cant remember the title or anything about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you are wrong. Cush never refered to all dark skinned sub saharans it reffered to a specific group of people  that were located south of Egypt. Some historians thing this is because the inhabitant of ancinet kush included most part of semetic Modern day Ethiopia as There are plenty of Axumite texts sound in modern day Sudan/Nubia . Others think this is because of axumite conquest which brought forth the doom of the nubian kingdom far after biblical times. In the new testament there is a story that  Philip the Evangelist was told by an angel to go to the road from Jerusalem to Gaza, and there he met the Ethiopian eunuch. He had been to Jerusalem to worship (Acts 8:27), and was returning home. This and the fact that Ethiopia is the only christian kingdom in the region and oldest christian kingdom in the world implies that kush/Ethiopia in the bible refers to  or includes for the most part semetic modern day Ethiopia. </TEXT>
