	<TEXT> I'm in Canada, been going to a private clinic for weekly sessions... However I'm getting to my insurance's maximum reimbursements, so next ones will be out of pocket :( 100$/session is a lot. I don't know anything about inpatient treatment, is that like when you're hospitalized?

EDIT: I'm sure you'll finish your qualification, good luck on that :) I wish you the best! </TEXT>

I feel like I'm complaining way too much for the circumstances, I know people have it way worse and would love to be in my shoes, but I can't help that I dread Monday morning all day Sunday, couldn't sleep last night because of this. :/ I just feel like an ungrateful little shit sometimes *shrugs*

My plan will have to include turning off Wifi once I actually get started on working on my Master's so I don't spend all day on TFAB!! </TEXT>

The best-case scenario would be to finish my degree with a break from work, but financially that would not be possible (because we have a house). Honestly I'm thinking about asking to be put on sick leave by my doctor. That would at least give me a percentage of my salary while I'm off work...

I would consider changing jobs for a part-time job, but honestly although I hate my job, I can't argue that the conditions are nothing to complain about (decent salary for the amount of work, paid vacations, etc).

I understand that quitting everything might not help, but damn that's what I feel like doing just now. I don't want to see anyone or do anything.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been at this job since May, and the main reason I hate it (and also hated my last one, which I worked for 4 years at), is that I'm currently completing a Master's degree but I'm working a freaking office agent position. I feel like my "talents" or "potential" is being wasted on trivial unimportant tasks that don't mean anything to anyone...
My colleagues are just... bittered employees who probably hate their jobs too, so I feel like everyone's just on the edge of a breakdown all the time, all I hear is complaining...
I am looking at other positions, but I don't want to change just for the sake of change, because I don't see how things will improve if I just get another entry-level job..

It just sucks and I feel like the longer I'm stuck here, the less I'll be able to do a better job, because right now I just hate everything so much I don't even feel like doing my actual job.
I've just started a reduced 4-day week, with my day off to be used to finish my Master's. So far I've succeeded in waking up at 11, then stressing out because I'm wasting my day off :/

TL, DR: I'm stuck in a rut, and know it's partly my fault. I need to snap out of it soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been feeling really down lately, and I have the feeling that isn't going to just go away on its own if I don't do something...

There are many reasons why I'm feeling like this, TTC being part of it (I think it's just excerbated things that were already there). I hate my job and I feel like a failure, because all my life my parents' focus on me had been my good grades and all that.. Well now, at 27, I feel like I'm letting everyone down because I'm not working in nutrition, the field in which I did a Bachelor's degree... I didn't love it that much and decided to do a Master's in education in order to be able to work with special needs students... Forward 2 years later, I'm still not done and I'm just struggling to keep my head above water. I don't even know if my Master's is going to bring me anywhere and help me secure a job I actually like... All these feelings are just crappy and I feel like I'm stuck here in this bad headspace.

I went to see a therapist last May because I hated my old job, it got me thinking about stuff and I changed jobs and figured I'd be fine... Well now 8 months later I hate my new job even more and feel like I've got no strength left to continue to go to work and plaster a smile on my face. I'm not productive, I hate all my colleagues, I feel so out of place and I just wish I could stay home...
I've gone back to see the therapist in December and am going weekly now, but I don't feel like it's helping at all, I just feel like I'm getting worse week by week. I spent the new year's countdown crying in the middle of the crowd, everyone just looked so happy, and all I could think was that 2016 had been absolute crap and I wasted my year feeling numb and sorry for myself, with no hope that 2017 would be any better.

I think I have depression. But I'm not able to say it out loud, to admit it to myself or anyone else. I don't know what to do. I feel like I need a break from work if I'm ever going to get on top again.

Holy crap I'm so sorry about the long rant, I feel like I'm just a Debbie-downer in here. But somehow typing all this to strangers takes a (tiny) load off my shoulders...

How's that for a Moody Monday? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw my doctor in November (after 3 months, 90 days into my first cycle post-HBC). She sent me for blood tests (the basics) and an ultrasound, told me to go back and see her in 3 months (February) if things still hadn't regularized by then. I have an appointment for next week, seeing as I've had 2 extremely short periods since the withdrawal bleed when I went off HBC in August.

I'm planning on inquiring more about thyroid issues (my TSH was 3.7 in November and I feel like crap all the time), as well as other hormonal issues (been having bad acne since getting off HBC along with lack of cycles). I definitely would like more testing and feel like if there's something wrong I'd like to know sooner rather than later on... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, it is really frustrating... I get that there's only a 20-30% chance per cycle in the best of circumstances, but pisses me off that we've only had 1 proper chance in 6 months... And doing OPKs seems helpful for many of you ladies, but I POAS for one whole month last cycle, never got a positive OPK when I finally did ovulate on CD41, so it just feels like a lot of work for nothing these days... It all just feels like I'm forever waiting, with no results at all, and I am NOT a patient person :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I get wanting to be in a better place before doing anything else... We've been at it for 6 months and I've only ovulated once, so obviously this is gonna take a while. I'm not in a good mental space right now, and not being pregnant is probably adding on to that, but there's a part of me that's almost relieved I'm not pregnant because holy crap I need to feel better before I can possibly think of growing a human being :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like this idea of making a list together- it's less of a contest as to who's doing what, and further testing could help figure out what's going on with her cycles. The SA is also a good idea, my fianc is supposed to call his GP for one soon, even though I'm pretty sure that due to my fucked up cycles the problem is me, at least we'll know things are ok on his end.
As for caffeine and alcohol, without 100% cutting it out, is it possible for you to reduce a bit? If your SO and you are both cutting down together it might be easier and less frustrating. 

As for the emotional shutdown, I have no useful advice except try to communicate openly and without judgement... Good luck and I hope you get answers soon (and a BFP) </TEXT>

In any case, just letting you know you're not alone and wishing you good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome!!

I highly suggest temping to confirm ovulation, that way you know that if you ovulated late (for example, on CD 25 instead of CD15) so you won't think your period is 10 days late and stres about getting BFNs and not knowing what is going on! As someone having gone off HBC in August and having had a 106-day cycle, then a 55-day cycle, if I wasn't temping I'd be going (even more) crazy.

Good luck! </TEXT>

I did talk about it to my doctor because of all my symptoms, but she said that we really weren't there yet (3 months ago, 3 months after stopping HBC). She said my body might just need more time to regulate post-HBC. I'm also not the "typical" PCOS type (BMI of 21, had no actual kysts on my ovaries, and yes I feel like I have some facial hair but I'm super blonde so it doesn't show too much), but I definitely feel like the other symptoms related to male hormones are there, so I will definitely bring it up at my next appointment with my doctor in 2 weeks. Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, fellow 27-year-old with flaring teenage acne here! :( Honestly this is the worst side-effect of going off HBC for me... I still haven't found anything that completely fends off acne, but I wash my face with Clean and Clear foaming oil-free cleanser, and my doctor prescribed a face cream with clindomycin and benzoyl peroxyde (one of the only combinations that are safe when pregnant).

For my hair, I used to easily go 2 days, and be able to stretch for a 3rd day, and now I stretch to 2 days :( I've started using Lush's Restauration shampoo and I love it, as it takes care of my oily roots without destroying my ends too much (I've got long hair and it's blonde, so the ends break super easily).

If anyone else has a magic combo, I'd love to hear of it!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I second alfalfa, it's usually more extreme quantities of physical exercise and extreme calorie deficits that mess up cycles, not a healthy workout 3-4 times a week! :) Good on you for starting to run more regularly, feels so good!

(PS- My best friend and I ran a half-marathon end of August and she was 2 weeks pregnant and didn't know it, so it didn't harm her baby, she's now 27 weeks along and super healthy :) ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kudos on doing it until the end! My sister asked for the Whole30 book for her birthday, I very quickly leafed through it but was like "Whoa, not sure I'd be willing to go all out!" I agree with the general sentiment but I don't necessarily feel like cutting out complete food groups is realistic! Although I feel like I'd need an overhaul of my current habits haha, I'm falling off the wagon :/

It's almost embarrassing lol, I've got a bachelor's degree in nutrition :O </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on Yasmin for almost 12 years (15-27 years old).

I don't really remember how I was before HBC to be honest, except that I had acne, and the pill was supposed to help.

So, this past August I got off HBC -- My boobs shrank, I got really bad acne (and backne, FML), still here after 6 months, I lost a lot of hair too (my hair was almost too think so it's not a big deal for me), got hair popping up all over the place.... :/ Sorry for not offering reassurance, but the effects really vary from person to person, and apparently, my stupid body is really crappy at functioning on its own... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, to be fair, I,ve only ovulated once since August so far, so whenever I did ovulate definitely wasn't *normal* hahaha! 1st cycle off HBC was 106 days anovulatory, 2nd cycle I ovulated on CD41, and now here I am, CD19 of my 3rd cycle... So I definitely don't consider myself a reference :P

(And yes, I am going back to see my doctor, I know this isn't normal)

Thanks for the vibes, I'll take O whenever it happens haha </TEXT>

I woke up at 10:30! OOps haha I guess I needed that 11 hours of sleep...
Still waiting to ovulate (CD19), I should start peeing on OPKs soon. Not looking forward to it, as last time I did so almost every day for a month, never got a positive OPK but ovulated on CD41 :/
Now I have to get off TFAB and get going! Have a nice day ladies :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hahahaha I know exactly how you feel!! Entering my temps last cycle after I had ovulated was like "Woohoo let's keep this temp up!" and now I'm on CD19, still haven't ovulated, and I'm just always anxious to see what my chart is going to end up looking like (spoiler alert: it's super wonky and spiky so far :( )

As far as the alcohol thing, you can tell your friend (wink wink) that it messes up my temps *big time* -- I'm usually between 96.6 and 97 before O, and if I have more than 1 drink it goes up to like 97.7, 97.9 :( I just discard those temps... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stopped HBC in August 2016 and went to see my doctor in November when I still hadn't gotten my period (ecept the withdrawal bleeding in August). She ran blood tests, hence how I know my TSH was 3.7 in November, and an ultrasound (I had a 3-cm kyst on my left ovary). She then sent me for a follow-up ultrasound in January (all clear, no more kysts), and told me to go back and see her for more testing in February (I have an appointment on the 23rd) if things don't regulate by then... So here I am, on CD19 of my 3rd cycle in 6 months. I was planning on asking about thyroid function as well as other hormonal problems... I never thought that I'd be here after 6 months :( I can't even plan BD around my fertile period, as so far I've had only one! I'm also temping and doing OPKs to have the most data I can get. Thanks for the support :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aww, Moondog... That's a lot to take in. I read the whole thing (woo hoo!) and your rambling is totally normal and was indeed informative. I'm glad you took charge of things to get answers instead of waiting around, it always feels better to know we're doing *something* at least...

I totally get that you don't want to give up now, and that's perfectly fine, you've still got some options!

It was also informative for me to see that they've given you meds for your 3.7 TSH, mine was also 3.7 in November and I've had long, fucked-up and anovulatory cycles, so will definitely talk with my doctor about possible hypothyroidism.

I just wish you the best of luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I get that... Did you explain to him that taking his vitamins and doing his part for the SA are things he *can* do to get more involved? And also remind him that without his swimmers there will never be a baby, so while you may be doing most of the temping and peeing on sticks and all, it takes 2 to have a baby!

And just the fact that you're aware you might be a little bit too self-sufficient might help you include him a bit more in the process if he wants to be? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man this sounds almost exactly like my situation...
My best friend and I both stopped HBC at the same time in August, thinking we might get pregnant around the same time... She got pregnant 2 weeks later (is now 27 weeks), and I've ovulated only once in that whole time, no BFP remotely in sight. I love her and she's my best friend, but she will never understand what I'm going through with TTC, not knowing what your body's doing, and being scared that you'll never be able to have a baby. I am really happy for her, but at the same time it hurts so bad every time I see her and her beautiful belly. It's not getting easier with time, her due date is coming up and there she'll be, with her perfect little baby, while my uterus will still be woefully empty... It sucks, but it's life. On top of it, I'll probably have to *organize* her shower, and I have no idea how I'm going to deal with that...

The one thing that's helped me a little bit is reminding myself that babies are not finite resources; just because someone else is getting one does not reduce your chances of having one too, it isn't pie! ;)

	<TEXT> Hmm, the auto-mod assumed you were new? But I know you've been here for a while Swiftlet :)

All kidding aside, I get your frustration... It seems like you feel like you're working a lone somewhat, like he isn't doing his part in this hard journey. It's good that you talked and that you were able to be honest. I hope that you guys get answers and that things move along for you, I'm rooting for you!

I'm sorry I don't have more useful advice :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure about the exact mg of the dosage, but I take the Mucinex pill (regular kind with only guafaisine (sp?)) just one a day in mid-afternoon (the package says the effects last 12 hours). I start taking it around CD12-14, but last cycle took it for a month, as I ovulated only on CD41. Hopefully this cycle I won't need to do it as long. I stop taking it once I know I've ovulated. And drinking water helps, otherwise there's nothing to liquefy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awww, even though I'd feel the same way about not getting ahead of myself, I think it's sweet that he's on board and optimistic about this! 
FYI my first cycle off hBC lasted 106 days with no ovulation to be seen. My second cycle lasted 55 days with confirmed O at CD41, and I'm now on CD14 of cycle 3 after 6 months off HBC. So don't give up hope, but it's good to be realistic and realize that with your long cycles you may need to arm yourselves with some patience. I hope you're getting answers on your PCOS and that things work out in the next cycle, fingers crossed! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, welcome! I don't have any "official" medical conditions which would make TTC a risk for me right now, but the past few months have brought up a lot of emotions for me, I'v been having a hard time (TTC-related stress may have exacerbated this but most of it is me being so unsure of myself and self-esteem issues and realizing I'm 27 and ain't got shit figured out and bla bla bla) and I think I may be in a depression and actually think that's it's been on and off for me for a *long* time. 

Anyhow, I get the TTC guilt when I think of how crappy I'm feeling right now and "why the hell do I think I can bring a baby into this world and take care of it right now" and "what if I stay this unhappy forever and end up being a crappy mother" and "you're crazy if you think having a baby will make you happier".

Sorry about my too-long ramble, but is there any way you could broach the subject with your doctor, to see if there are any major issues that would really warrant not having a baby vs. what you *think* your doctor may think of you? Sorry if I'm not being clear. What I mean to say is that if you really want this, then go for it! What you're doing right now by trying to get healthier is great. Ask questions to your doctor, advocate for yourself...

Good luck! </TEXT>
