	<TEXT> someone with California problems should not matter more than someone with Utah problems. 

If only you cared about the opposite being true.

There are [approximately](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2012/11/presidential_election_a_map_showing_the_vote_power_of_all_50_states.html) 508,000 Californians per electoral vote and 315,000 Utahns per EV, giving Utahns roughly 60% more voting power. I don't think Californians should have roughly three-fifths the vote as Utahns.

And a New Yorker has approximately 1/4 the voting power as a Wyomingite.

America is the only democracy that so overtly perverts the basic democratic rule of one person, one vote. Land mass does not vote. People do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Women are unfair men-blamers. I keep quotes of women to prove how bad they are. Also, I'm not the sexist, they are."

I'm aware of women in a single state, New Jersey, being allowed to vote if they owned land, but only until 1807, when that loophole was closed. (Women's property would conventionally become owned by their husband upon marriage, anyway.) And I'm aware of a single case in Massachusetts. I'm not aware of any such provision in Oregon. There may be information to the contrary, but it seems quite esoteric if so. Regardless, the legitimacy of a government derives from the consent of the governed, including those putatively irresponsible non-property owners. </TEXT>

The first woman was elected to the Oregon House in 1914 and the Senate in 1915. The first woman was elected to Congress in 1936 and to the US Senate in 1950. But it took until Barbara Roberts in 1990 before a woman was elected governor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was from the FBI report, which was released the Friday before a three-day weekend. 

[Here's an article:](http://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/03/fbi-report-platte-river-network-employee-bleachbit-delete-clinton-e-mails/)

Sometime between March 25 and 31, 2015, the Platte River employee had an Oh expletive moment that the files werent deleted. He told the FBI that he then deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the PRN server and used BleachBit to delete the exported .PST files he had created on the server system containing Clintons e-mails, according to the FBI report.  ...

 The employee told the FBI in a May 3, 2016 interview that he was aware of the existence of the preservation request and the fact that it meant he should not disturb Clintons e-mail data on the PRN Server.

 Clinton told the FBI she was never deleted nor did she instruct anyone to delete e-mails and was unaware of Platte Rivers deletions from March 2015. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speaking of liars, the FBI concluded that Hillary did not delete her emails, a tech at the firm where her server was kept did. He was given immunity so that he could rat out Clinton without incriminating himself, but he told investigators he wiped the server of his own accord because he thought it was supposed to have been done earlier for security purposes.

Also, Trump is floating Petraeus for Secretary of State, the guy who actually committed a crime by willfully handing over classified information to someone who wasn't supposed to have it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There have been other holidays in the last 40 years. This isn't some sudden development because of a four-day week. Here's the [four-week moving average](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IC4WSA), which smoothes out any single-week phenomena. As you can see, it is still the lowest in over 40 years. And there is no big leg downward where one state or another reduced their benefits and therefore made them less tempting. That can have an effect, but the sheer magnitude of the decline is simply unexplainable by such factors. This really is a factor of fewer layoffs, as indicated by [this chart of layoffs and discharges](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTS1000LDL). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As you probably know but are hoping others don't, Republicans and Democrats were essentially the opposite parties on race until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was pushed by JFK until he was assassinated, and the GOP moved to grab the South through the "Southern Strategy" for decades thereafter.

Today, the Republican choice for White House strategist has [some kind of issue with Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley](https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/17/trump-advisor-takes-issue-with-silicon-valleys-asian-ceos/), while a Trump surrogate is [citing the internment of Japanese](https://thinkprogress.org/carl-higbie-trump-muslim-registry-internment-camps-769310d9f9c6) as precedent for creating a Muslim registry.

There are now 12 Asian-American Senators and Representatives currently or soon to serve in Congress. All of them are Democrats, none of them are Republicans. They are Marie Hirono, Tammy Duckworth, Kamala Harris, Robert Scott, Mike Honda, Doris Matsui, Judy Chu, Ami Bera, Tulsi Gabbard, Grace Meng, Mark Takano, and Ted Lieu. </TEXT>

But [racial views are way more predictive](http://www.salon.com/2016/11/13/yep-race-really-did-trump-economics-a-data-dive-on-his-supporters-reveals-deep-racial-animosity/) than economic views of which candidate people supported. If it were vice versa, and we concluded that people were drawn to an economic message, there wouldn't be nearly as much resistance to believing that. But because the data shows it was more about race, people resist accepting it.

	<TEXT> This was not an election about economic policy. Trump voters did not ignore "Mexicans are rapists," "lock her up," and "complete shutdown of Muslims," they were drawn to it. The chants and t-shirts at Trump rallies weren't "No more NAFTA," they were "TRUMP THAT BITCH." Trump is a gold-plated billionaire or millionaire offering massive tax cuts for other millionaires and billionaires who has no realistic ability to bring back industrial jobs, as the GOP is [already admitting](http://grist.org/briefly/mitch-mcconnell-has-already-admitted-gop-promises-to-out-of-work-coal-miners-wont-come-true/).

I didn't lie, I quoted numbers with links that you quibbled with to once again avoid the massive lie about 3 million. If you aren't satisfied that the data presented is appropriate, find data about 3 million that you actually can believe.

Those with criminal records were prioritized, but there were still only 226,000 with criminal records, and only 86,000 with serious offenses. Criminals are convicted in court. We know who they are.

	<TEXT> When we talk about criminals, we're talking about people who have been convicted in a court. It's not like we don't know about them.

[Between 2008 and 2012](http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/310/), ICE issued about a million detainer notices where they wanted to apprehend suspected undocumented immigrants. Of those, only 226,000 had criminal records, 86,000 being serious cases. This was in a four-year period. And those with criminal records were prioritized for detainers, it's not like there were a bunch of criminals that ICE didn't care about.

Most of the annual removals of people with criminal records are people who got a conviction that year and were taken into custody and processed for removal. Remember, criminals are convicted in court. There aren't millions of free-roaming undocumented immigrants being convicted in absentia.

The real numbers are simply nowhere near Trump's massive, baseless, fear-mongering lie about foreign hordes of millions of dangerous bogeymen that he'll protect us from. </TEXT>

The other commenter was promoting the "reasonable fear" standard, where it's your fear that matters, not an immediate threat of death or injury. "I feared for my life" is a very potent tool for avoiding conviction, but it has a reputation as a get-out-of-jail card that is often abused.

	<TEXT> I'm not actually talking to you, I'm talking to the reasonable non-Hitler fans who may be reading. Heritage's logic would deport the white working class voters who gave us Trump, since it's predicated on the non-college educated paying less in taxes and receiving more benefits. (Total college grads voted for Clinton.) They use single-year averaging to avoid how virtually *every* citizen, not just current retirees, will cost a ton in Social Security and Medicare, which undocumenteds will provide a net benefit to by only paying in and not taking out. Heritage also fails to admit that taxes and benefits are a mere fraction of a person's economic impact. Consumer spending is big. It creates jobs by providing the demand for goods and services that businesses require. It's the whole reason why booming populations lead to rising economies, even in poorer countries like China and India. All that spending and employment also increases tax revenue. But again, taxes aren't the only economic benefit from a growing population. </TEXT>
