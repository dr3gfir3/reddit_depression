	<TEXT> Hey..

So this is my first time posting here and I deeply apologize if this question has been asked alot, but:

Is there ANY server that has INSTANT PVP with a very big population, no p2w elements and is actually very fun to play? 
I was about to play on "http://wowsulvus.es/fusion/" but found out pretty early that it is only populated by spanish people.
So does anyone have a suggestion to where I should go?

Thanks in advance 3 </TEXT>

I heard that beta should be no longer than 6 months. Would that be true? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey!
I don't know if there has been other posts regarding this, if so: I'm sorry.

But, I've heard somewhere that the finishing product will support mods. Is this true? ARE the mods going to be limited to "battle-royale mode" or is there potential for survival mods like "dayz" and other things just like in arma3. Because that would be very neat!

Thanks in advance 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> oh thank you so much! I just tried combat calculator and it is amazing. But I didn't use it before though, that's no problem I guess

I'll try to do the most important quests that every guide is suggesting too and try to follow the combat calculator to level up as many skills as possible for my current combat level. thank you so much dude. you're amazing 3
