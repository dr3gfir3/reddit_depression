	<TEXT> The seat belts would only require suitable mounting points so that would not be difficult. Airbags would require sensors and electronics. Integrating that into the original steering column and dash would not work. At this point it starts becoming more of a resto-mod. I don't think it would be impossible to adapt modern airbag components into a resto-mod but it doesn't look like it is very popular. [Here is a 34 Ford resto-mod](http://www.thebaycitymotorcompany.com/c0000247) and [here is another one.](http://www.spudsgarage.com/vehicles/34FordVicKen/) Both have shoulder belts and many other modern components but not airbags. </TEXT>

I can't find a reliable source for the fourth one but since that is the Statler Hilton on the right it is after 1956.

Not sure of the source of the seventh one but it appears to be looking east down Commerce with the Santa Fe Terminal Building in the center of the photo.

	<TEXT> [The Library of Congress says](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2009632339/) this was August 20, 1959 and they were at the Arkansas state capitol in Little Rock protesting the admission of the ["Little Rock Nine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Nine) to Central High School.

In 1957 the integration had initially been blocked when Governor Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to support the segregationists.  The nine were eventually admitted to Little Rock Central High under the protection of the US Army's 101st Airborne Division, but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse by many of the white students. In 1958 Faubus ordered the closure of all four public high schools, preventing both black and white students from attending school. On August 12, 1959 after moderate school board members were elected the schools were reopened and the black students returned. [On that day a crowd of some 200 people gathered in protest at the capitol but when they marched to within a block of Central High they were met by the police. The police used force and fire hoses to disperse the crowd and some demonstrators were arrested.](http://i.imgur.com/Gz1EeIB.jpg)

I don't know if the date shown at the Library of Congress is incorrect or if the protesters shown in the posted photo were assembling the week after the schools reopened. </TEXT>
