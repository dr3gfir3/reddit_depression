	<TEXT> I honestly don't know. It could've been left outside; and I'm pretty certain it was. I changed my preferences the other day on the courier website to leave parcels in/outside the shed because I didn't want to go round that creep's house and somehow my stuff still ends up in his house. What is scaring me the most is the aspect that in a short amount of time my parcel went from my garden to his house, all whilst I was inside my house.  </TEXT>
