	<TEXT> My Mum makes a pot of soup every Saturday and has done for my whole 21 years. Every Saturday my Dad will sit and eat a bowl of soup and proclaim that he thought it was great and really enjoyed it. He told me in confidence about a year ago that he hates soup, always has done, and that it makes him feel sick. Yet he still eats it and has never told my Mum. I think that gives you a good idea of what my parents are like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The council is cracking down on the number of bins in the centre with a new pilot on rose street to start with that means that commercial bins are no longer allowed on the street, and rubbish can only be out at certain times of the day for pick up. The problem with this is that it's expensive as hell for small business and that the commercial bin company's are incredibly unreliable. For the bar I work in it means that we have to keep our rubbish on the premises over night and we are a tiny bar about 24ft by 20ft. This causes all kinds of hygiene issues with as far as we can tell, no real solution. Suggestions welcome! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most interesting man I ever met whilst working was in the pub in Edinburgh I worked in for a bit. A guy called "Ronnie". "Ronnie" was one of our regulars, an older bloke who had done loads of stuff in his life. An ex-army boxer who served in Northern Ireland during the troubles and when he de-mobbed worked in a bar in London run by the Cray family. Whilst he was working for the Crays he dealt with guns pointed at him, cops harassing him etc even though all he genuinely didnt have any involvement with them criminally. After this he worked as a porter at the Ritz for a while and met all sorts of celebrities. Now here he is in Edinburgh sitting at the bar most days, and there wouldn't be a day that went by without someone coming in and having a heart to heart with him, he is a marriage counsellor, grief easer, story teller, advice giver and friend to many people from all over the world who whenever they are in town, will make the effort to come and see him. A properly stand up bloke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Making cocktails - sure memorising a lot of drinks takes time, but when you come down to it most cocktails are just a formula. Sours are 2 strong one sweet one sour, doesn't matter what the strong, sweet, and sour actually are. Shake that with an egg white, put it in a tall glass and add soda and boom! You've got a fizz! People are very easily impressed by that and its not a difficult skill to learn. Actually using it to make money is a whole different ball game though - think cooking at home compared to working in a professional kitchen. </TEXT>

Rest of the week much the same, although a bottle of laphroig is waiting at home for me when I get in tonight. In honour of St Paddys day, have a poem -not my own as I have the word smithing skills of a dyslexic aardvark but something you will hopefully appreciate none the less. 

Some Guinness was spilt on the barroom floor 
When the pub was closed for the night 
Out of his hole crept a wee brown mouse 
and stood in the pale moonlight. 
He lapped up the frothy foam from the floor 
then back on his haunches he sat. 
All night long you could hear him roar, 
"Bring on the goddamn cat!" </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Could have been stabbed on Saturday night... </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So there I am working away on Saturday night when a group of guys come in and start ordering jger-bombs, 10 at a time on top of all the pints/spirit+mixers etc. Within half an hour of them ordering maybe 40  jger-bombs in total (it was a group of probably 8-10) it becomes clear that two of them are well on there way to being drunk. My bar is pretty small so we have a strict door policy. One of my fellow bartenders explains to the group that they're going to have to leave, we apologise it's not my personal policy it's part of the licensing act etc etc. The group does not take this well and my colleague has to retreat behind the bar. So I go and speak to them to stop them yelling abuse at my colleague, I'm very much of the fight them with smiles school of cutting people off but even still initially there is one guy who is very very in my face, his mates actually pull him back at one point. Eventually though, through persistent smiles and apologies out of my control feel free to come back another time etc etc they agree to finish they're drinks and leave. An hour later I've managed to get outside for a cigarette, two guys who had been in earlier but had left whilst I was talking to the group approach me and tell me that they'd left because the guy who was all in my face had a blade and was about to use it which is why his mates pulled him back... So yeah nearly got stabbed. I'm just real glad I was nice to them, could have gone a lot worse. </TEXT>
