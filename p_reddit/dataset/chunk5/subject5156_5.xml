	<TEXT> I honestly feel like this game isn't designed to win defenses at all, on either side. It seems like both sides can easily 100% a base, especially if you use 6 airstrikes. I'm a new lvl 8 Imperial, and unless I have 4 snipers in my Squad Center, I will lose every single defense. Even with snipers, I can easily loose 100k in resources or 1,000CB if my shields get taken out and the rebel uses air strikes. I think the air strikes are way overpowered. You shouldn't be able to destroy a resource storage holding 50k or 100k loot with a 6,000 credit air strike. I play a lot of Clash of Clans as well, and I kind of compare the air strikes to the lightning spell. I can't imagine how the game mechanics would be broken if you could use 1 lightning spell to destroy an entire storage.

For attacks, I usually use the Hero AT-AT, 3 tanks, 2 spider tank guys, 5 dark troopers and 18 or so storm troopers. I can consistently get 2 stars and most of the loot, and especially if I use air strikes. That being said, I've been absolutely wrecked by rebels using nothing but med droids and heavies.

There are a few things you can do to make your base less appealing to attacks, beyond what others have already said. You can expose your HQ and hope that people just snipe it and move on. You can also try to never have too much of both credits and alloy. If you're heavy on both resources, you're a huge target, but if you keep one low, you will be a less desirable target. </TEXT>
