	<TEXT> for 19 miles of my 25 mile drive to work the system works flawlessly. i am much more happy when i arrive to work and i am much less endangering myself with my own leadfoot.

 nbsp;
when the wife and i ordered the car i had no intention of adding autopilot, but she really wanted it so ok then...   on delivery day i enabled AP for the first time and it was a white knuckle situation. was afraid the car would not turn for that curve, would not brake for that car, would not see the jerkhole that cut in front of me. turned out it could handle all those situations better then i would. the car does not get frustrated and is not susceptible to road rage. the more you use AP on a drive to work the more enlightened you get. i have far less anger when it comes to other drivers, because i can use my newly freed up brainpower to analyze there actions more. i also have less of a "in a rush" feeling to get where ever it is i am going. 

 nbsp;
re: mistakes, never. not at all. maybe its my route but in the 8 month history of my car the only time i ever saw AP totally fuck up a situation was an off ramp that has little to no markings and makes a 270* change of direction with a radius of 120 ft. back in the early days of AP there were 2 spots on the 210 freeway where the car appeared like it was just going to drive into the center divider on a curve, but later i learned it just took them WAY late. 1 software update fixed that. </TEXT>
