	<TEXT> Let's take the case of a rock with a smiley face painted on. When a person says "it's cruel to heat that rock" we reply to them "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked by the smiley face into thinking that the rock is qualitatively different from other physical systems."

What I'm trying to get at is that, when a naturalist thinks that they have encountered a genuine instance of empathy (i.e. one with a real human, not a rock with a disguise) which provides a justification for treating them differently to an inanimate object, naturalism inescapably leads to the conclusion: "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked into thinking that the human being is qualitatively different from other physical systems which it is clearly **not** cruel to treat in this way (blocks of marble, clouds of helium gas, pools of tar, and so on).

As prominent philosopher of biology Michael Ruse put it: *"If everyone recognized the illusory nature of morality (and could escape from their biology sufficiently to take advantage of this recognition), then very soon people would start to cheat and the whole social system would collapse. Altruism would go and with it would go altruism. Hence, our biology leads us to objectify morality. Ethical skepticism may be the correct philosophy; but our genes are working flat out to make such a conclusion counter-intuitive.*"

To extend the analogy, imagine you asked the person "What is your intellectual justification for saying "don't be
cruel to this rock"? Surely you could see how if they answered "It's so glaringly obvious: I experience
a feeling of empathy toward it, and I think that this feeling arises in me because of the evolutionary history of my ancestors", all they have done is **described** certain experiences they have: they
haven't actually provided any justification.

-------

As to pointing that there are people, or societies who don't rape and murder, and who aren't religious, this misses the point of the argument.

Person 1: Belief A and  behaviour B are intellectually inconsistent

Person 2: Thats not true at all: I met a man who says that he believes in A and I saw him do B just the other day.

Person 2 hasn't demonstrated the intellectual consistency of A and B by pointing out this example. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for elaborating.

Let me point out that you initially claimed that *"In the debate against Carroll, for instance, he opens with "Everything that begins to exist requires a cause", which he then clearly uses as a stepping stone for a Kalam type argument. But then, no, suddenly when cornered by Carroll's deconstruction of Craig's Kalam, it turns out Craig meant it was actually to be interpreted a la Leibniz."*

You now say that you were thinking of his debate with Krauss, but, contrary to what you said here, Craig does not, as you said, start out his debate with Krauss by discussing the premise "everything that begins to exist has a cause" and then redirecting to the Leibnizian argument when he has been addressed on the former front: it's Leibnizian from the very start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Augustine differs in that he didn't make the sharp distinction of the works of believers being part of sanctification as opposed to justification, like many Reformed thinkers do. In chapter 18 of his book Grace and Free Will he writes:

*Unintelligent persons, however, with regard to the apostle's statement: We conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law, Romans 3:28 have thought him to mean that faith suffices to a man, even if he lead a bad life, and has no good works. Impossible is it that such a character should be deemed a vessel of election by the apostle, who, after declaring that in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, Galatians 5:6 adds at once, but faith which works by love.*

In the same work he goes on to ask *If eternal life is rendered to good works, as the Scripture most openly declares: "Then He shall reward every man according to his works" Matthew 16:27, how can eternal life be a matter of grace, seeing that grace is not rendered to works, but is given gratuitously, as the apostle himself tells us: "To him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt" Romans 4:4, and again: "There is a remnant saved according to the election of grace" with these words immediately subjoined: "And if of grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace?" Romans 11:5-6 How, then, is eternal life by grace, when it is received from works?"*

But then he doesn't go on to say "these passages are to be harmonised in the following way: Christ was rewarded for His works, and we have His works imputed to us in justification", as many Reformed thinkers would.

Rather, he goes on to argue that these passages are to be harmonised in that *"those good works of ours, which are recompensed with eternal life, belong to the grace of God,".* </TEXT>

Surely you would agree that people experiencing empathy and an instinct for self-preservation might be the kind of thing we'd expect to see in a world in which nihilism is true?

If so, then you can't take the fact that people experience empathy and an instinct for self-preservation as evidence for the claim that nihilism is false (i.e. that the fact that these experiences exist "generates morality").  </TEXT>

A short but beautiful reading which serves to remind us that the ultimate end is not merely the continuation of the finite good things of this life forever, but union with God. 

Communion setting was Michael Haydn's Missa tempore Quadragesima, with the Gloria taken from Walker's Celtic Mass.

For All The Saints and Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones were the hymns I remembered.

	<TEXT>  How many rapists do you think will confess? Oh, look, 0. Great work.

Could a rapist who would only confess if they knew that they wouldn't have to face any legal consequences for their crime ever be considered truly penitent? 

And if so, wouldn't a reduction in their numbers just mean fewer bad confessions, which wouldn't really be a loss, would it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This reading gives me an excuse to post my favourite quote from St John Chrysostom:

*"As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.*

*And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old said, "You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."*

	<TEXT>  an emerging academic consensus over the past couple of decades that the Israelite God indeed commanded firstborn child sacrifice from Israelites,

Well, I'm certainly aware of it, but beyond the level of something like refuting the EvilBible.com proof-texting of Exodus 13:2, I guess I don't really have the time or learning to fully address it. But based on my past experience, lemme just say that, it seems like if there's a *possible* trace of disunity in Scripture then critical scholars are too quick to treat that as a *probable* case of disunity  ;)

	<TEXT> The remark about a lack of wooden legs at Lourdes by French skeptic Anatole France's friend is often quoted in isolation, but here's the full version of what France actually wrote:

*Happening to be at Lourdes, in August, I paid a visit to the grotto where innumerable crutches were hung up in token of a cure. My companion pointed to these trophies of the sick-room and hospital ward, and whispered in my ear:*

*One wooden leg would be more to the point.*

*It was the word of a man of sense; but speaking philosophically, the wooden leg would be no whit more convincing than a crutch. If an observer of a genuinely scientific spirit were called upon to verify that a mans leg, after amputation, had suddenly grown again as before, whether in a miraculous pool or anywhere else, he would not cry: Lo! a miracle. He would say this:*

*An observation, so far unique, points us to a presumption that under conditions still undetermined, the tissues of a human leg have the property of reorganizing themselves like a crabs or lobsters claws and a lizards tail, but much more rapidly. Here we have a fact of nature in apparent contradiction with several other facts of the like sort. The contradiction arises from our ignorance, and clearly shows that the science of animal physiology must be reconstituted, or to speak more accurately, that it has never yet been properly constituted. It is little more than two hundred years since we first had any true conception of the circulation of the blood. It is barely a century since we learned what is implied in the act of breathing.*

*I admit it would need some boldness to speak in this strain. But the man of science should be above surprise. At the same time, let us hasten to add, none of them have ever been put to such a proof, and nothing leads us to apprehend any such prodigy. Such miraculous cures as the doctors have been able to verify to their satisfaction are all quite in accordance with physiology. So far the tombs of the Saints, the magic springs and sacred grottoes, have never proved efficient except in the case of patients suffering from complaints either curable or susceptible of instantaneous relief. But were a dead man revived before our eyes, no miracle would be proved, unless we knew what life is and death is, and that we shall never know.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We know this with a high degree of confidence because the Tower of Babel was specifically constructed with brick-and-mortar to withstand another such flood, which means the flood needed to be small enough that an ancient brick-and-mortar tower on a high hill would be able to withstand it:

Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon states that the Tower was destroyed by wind, and Sanhedrin 109a states that one-third of the Tower of Babel was burnt by fire.

I have a problem with the official account of events, though: wind can't melt clay-brick towers. And what about the 4000 Shemites who were told not to go into work that day? Just a few honest questions from an open mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And, at the First Pentecost, 3000 are put to death for idolatry. (Exodus 32:28)

At the Greater Pentecost, 3000 are baptised. (Acts 2:41)

St John Chrysostom wrote in his "Instructions to Catechumens":

*"As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.*

*And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old said, "You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."*

If you are interested in pursuing this topic, I recommend the [following video to begin with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAIHs5TJRqQ).

Really? Are you sure it's not Odin?

If you have a look at that video, you might get a sense for why the arguments of classical natural theology do not lead to an entity with the properties that I would think that Odin or Zeus would have.

This is a nonsensical statement, and I don't think you understand what the words mean when you type them.

Not at all. [See this Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry for more, if you are genuinely interested in pursuing this topic](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentals-medieval/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, this statement is flawed in that it presumes that all replication will be 100% perfect. Obviously it is not. The fact of evolution requires that.

This premise doesn't presume that there will be a 100% accurate replication: it presumes that mutations will have a more deleterious effect on early developmental stages than later ones. Read the quote by Miller and Levine.

 Yeah, no shit. Organisms of different species are different. What a giant fucking shock. 

And, as the citations in the original post note, evolutionary theory predicts that early development *should be conserved*, and so then the question becomes whether the observed deviations in early development are sufficient to falsify that prediction.

Whatever, I don't even know why I'm bothering talking to you, your imaginary friend will just tell you that everyone is lying for ... reasons. Probably satan or something.
