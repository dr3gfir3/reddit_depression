	<TITLE> PSA Dota players are being targeted and physically hurt by these grocery store workers </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I like to wear a elaborate Silencer costume as part of my every day life. I went to the grocery store and saw how depressed everyone was, so I thought I would help. I started dancing in the aisles and yelling at people and running up to people and taking things out of their cart. It was great fun. Then when I went to check out, there was only one lane open and there was a long line. I screamed and screamed while in line and danced, bumping into other people. I opened a box of baking soda and threw it around. Finally, I got to the checkout. I started making noises at the cashier and I kept pressing buttons on the computer. Some people in line were groaning because the line was getting very long, but that gave me even more incentive to make them laugh. I climbed onto the table and started kicking peoples groceries on the floor and screaming. The manager and one of his goons pulled me off and said I could never shop there again. Can I sue for harassement or possibly assault? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why being toxic might actually be a good thing, an open and honest discussion. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why peope are toxic. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

Full disclosure, i sometimes behave toxic in ranked. If a player in my team dies, I spam ping him, say gg over and over, tell others to report him, and then go into his lane to get his xp. I may also feed a courier to punish him for dying.

You may think this behavior is bad but it is actually a good thing. I make the person who died feel like garbage, and make myself feel like a king. He is motivated to not die again, and the other players see me not as a teammate, but an iconoclast to be worshipped. This makes us play better and become more cohesive as a team. In the end, we have a much better chance of winning because of me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You couldn't be more wrong. Lag doesn't ruin a game, missing a chance to connect with another person does. Many times, a friendship that starts in Dota leads to a real world friendship.

	<TITLE> Why playing on other nation's servers is a good thing, an open and honest discussion </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why using foreign servers is a good thing. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

Some people get bent out of shape when players from other countries play on their home servers. This is foolish. I play on servers all over the world. It helps me experience another culture and meet new friends. Some guidelines to help you do the same are:

1. Pause early and pause often. Each pause is an opportunity for discussion and culture.
2. Use google translate. If you don't speak the language, pause every time someone chats and input it into google translate so you understand
3. Stay in the jungle. If your ping is too high to play effectively, stay in the jungle for easy xp.
4. Get to know the other players. Insist on discussion, if they don't answer consider grabbing their attention with pings.
5. Punish unwelcoming cultures. If ur teammates don't participate, send an message that Dota is a welcoming community by feeding the courier or gems to the other team.

Remember, playing dota can be a wonderful and cultural experience if you invest the time and energy to do it right! Thanks and good luck!

I occasionally feed the courier. I am not proud of it, but I admit it. I do it primarily because it makes me feel good. For a brief moment, it feels like I control my teammates and they view me as a god. I'm not trying to ruin the game or anything like that. I also think people overreact to a courier feed. 1 courier feed hardly decides a game, and I think weaker players use it as en excuse for their own poor playing. Those are just my opinions, and I welcome yours. Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently moved into an old house with my family. When I first moved in I met a man who lived in the neighborhood. I came back from work early and saw this man running through my backyard. I asked my wife and she was all disheveled, she said she saw him too. She then told me that this man had died recently and must be haunting our new home! I have seen him several more times, once in my bedroom while my wife was sleeping and for a few days he was in the basement. My wife told me to stay upstairs so she could hold a seance to get rid of him, but came back in a few hours looking exhausted, saying it didn't work. I also once saw him in the grocery store at the checkout! Are there any ghost experts out there who can help me, I want to move but my wife refuses too. She says I should just ignore the ghost! Is there any way to get rid of a spectral being!?!? Please help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife is constantly calling me a loser just because I like dota and the character Silencer, and am having trouble getting a job. She thinks she is so great because she is a lawyer and makes a lot of money. I like to wear a Silencer costume and go around town. I go into stores and dance around, knocking merchandise on the floor. I dance in front of cars so they can't move and the drivers get mad. I knock on houses and when they answer I scream in their faces and try to push my way in to smash their things. I like to entertain people and spread Dota awareness. I believe that is more important then making money. She yells at me all the time. I asked if we could include the Silencer costume in our lovemaking and she flipped out. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why I encourage Peruvians to play on US servers, an open and honest discussion </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why letting Peruvians play on us servers works very well. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

First off, yes they have bad internet and computers. So what? If they lose the connection just pause it. If they feed or spam, take the opportunity to try and help him mature. These people live in poverty, they need our help, not our disdain. I had a Peruvian on my team, and he died 5 times in the first 10 minutes. Did I freak out? No, I talked to him. I trained with him. I wired him money to help with his bills and family. A friendship formed. Now he is 6k MMR. I was invited to his village for his birthday, which was a great time. I ended up being intimate with a beautiful Peruvian woman. Be helpful, it pays off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why the current reporting system works very well. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

First off, full disclosure. I occasionally feed the courier. I am not proud of it, but I admit it. I do it primarily because it makes me feel good. For a brief moment, it feels like I control my teammates and they view me as a god. I'm not trying to ruin the game or anything like that. Many of you would like to be able to report me and get me banned. Luckily, the report system won't let you, and this is a good thing. You see I bring a meta game to the table. But not knowing if I will feed the courier, my teammates have a more exciting game. In your anger, you try to report me but I'm never stopped. You see ur monthly report is not enough to do anything, and the chance that everyone will have a report available for me is non existent. In effect, there is no way to stop me, and that's great news. So sit back and enjoy a more exciting and more rewarding gaming experience!

Those are just my opinions, and I welcome yours. Thank you.
