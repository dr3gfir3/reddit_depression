	<TEXT> I heard a saying once that might help you better articulate this: women talk face-to-face, whereas men talk side-to-side.

It's part of the reason, as I understand it, that men's sheds are project-focused - Mrs Smith's lawnmower might still be broken by the time everyone goes home, but all six guys who were "fixing" it have a more confident understanding of their adolescent children, for example. </TEXT>

The name of the Facebook page was "A Real Marvel Fan Always Stays Until After the Credits" or something along those lines.

	<TEXT> 'Sup folks.

I'm wondering if anyone could offer me any advice by way of saving my phone's USB port. Data transfer has become unreliable (at best), and now it looks like charging is only possible if the phone is held t'the cable at a slight angle.

I'm open to attaching a wireless charging pad to the device in the hope that this might extend the port's lifespan, but I'm wondering if anyone else can offer any assistance? Any tips at all would be helpful, as getting a new device isn't really an option for me at the moment.

Many thanks in advance folks, I'm looking forward t'hearing all of your suggestions. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Photo Backup - Possible to Maintain Folder Integrity? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-20 18:34:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all,

So I've accumulated an enormous amount of photos on my devices since I first purchased it, and over time I've sorted them into individual folders on the device. I'm interested in backing these photos up, which is a difficult enough task, but I'm also interested in keeping the photos in their assigned folders, which is proving nigh-on impossible.

Can anybody recommend a way I might go about doing this? Local back-ups are preferred (I'm on a Mac, if that helps), but I'm happy to resort to cloud-based options, if that's all that's available.

I'm really hopeful that this whole folder situation can be helped, it'd save me a *tonne* of work in the long run.

Thank you all so much for your help. :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's nothing inherently disrespectful to the doctors written in this article. All they say is that his son's medical team realized they could do nothing more for him. The focus after that is entirely on the trip, the child's merciful recovery, and how grateful they are for his improvement, long may it last.

Don't get me wrong, I acknowledge that pieces regularly appear in glossy magazines and tabloids and the like outright *attacking* modern medicine in favor of some ridiculous diet, exercise regime, faith healer, or other "alternative" treatment, but there's none of that here, that I could detect anyway.

As for the doctors themselves? They've undoubtedly worked very closely with the child over the five years of his illness, I'm sure they'd be just as relieved as his family to see him well again, regardless of how or why that's come about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Women don't give a shit about men's feelings unless they are feelings about women's feelings.

It's pretty clear that he's talking about *all* women here, regardless of a man's relationship with them, and the three of us have said that not all of the women in our lives are like that. I'd think most people in relationships are, in a sense, reluctant to share *everything* with their S.O., due to fear of rejection.

It's not a gender issue, it's a *people* issue, and the objective is to surround ourselves with *people* who value us and will listen to our struggles, and to eventually engage in and nurture a relationship with one such *person*. The price of this is the time it takes to wade through and weed out those people who don't value us and/or assist us through our difficulties, and then do the same for those who will. It hurts finding out someone doesn't value you as much as you value them, but this is a practical pitfall of paying the aforementioned price. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *[Superman: Red Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Red_Son)* was a take on Kal if he'd landed in Soviet Russia rather than America. It's a really amazing read, and even though it's an *Elseworlds* imprint it serves as a shining example of Kal's flawless character. It falls apart toward the end, IMHO, but it's definitely worth it for the journey. </TEXT>

I've had the bootloader unlocked for a while now on my XT1052, but Motorola sent me a link to the XT1053 .zip. Is this because I requested the bootloader unlock code, and am therefore automatically using a developer edition Moto X/XT1053? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 40, or thereabouts.

I got up at 08:00 the day of my grandad's funeral, attended said funeral, skipped the afters (not that I'd've been going anyway, t'cut a long story short) and headed straight back to college to put the finishing touches to my final year project's thesis, which I did overnight in all alone. I also had a piece I'd written for a magazine due for completion, so I did that too, picked up some comic books to reward myself, and headed on home again, but I don't think I hit the hay 'til about midnight or thereabouts, maybe even later. I think I slept for about fourteen hours or so afterwards.

In all honestly I'd do it again, it was nowhere near as bad as the bouts of genuine insomnia I've suffered over anxiety and related issues. The difference between "can't sleep" and "won't sleep" is a chasm you don't take so lightly once you've stared across it with your own bleary, unfocused, and bloodshot eyes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> CM 12.1 on Moto X XT1052 (2013) - At this stage I can't not go for it, but first I've some questions... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-25 01:07:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm fairly certain that CM 12.1 is the way to go on my European variant 2013 Moto X, but I've a few questions first:

1) I flashed Faux Kernel onto 4.4.4 some time ago, and understand that this may be a problem. I'd happily jump through the hoops of reverting to stock before flashing CM 12.1, but Motorola have linked me to an XT1053 .zip instead of the XT1052 .zip, which I'm going to need, right? How do I go about attaining the correct .zip, or will this be necessary?

2) With regard to backups, I've made a NANDroid in TWRP, but would like to be able to restore my apps and their relevant data in CM 12.1, including contact details, call logs, and text messages. Would I be right in saying that Titanium Backup is insufficient for this task? If so, what alternatives should I apply? Is there a separate solution again for the various pictures (saved from the web, photos I've taken etc.) on the device? I really don't want to sacrifice any of this data...

Major thanks to anybody who can help me out here, if there's any more information that might be of help I'll do my absolute best to provide it.

I'm looking forward to jumping aboard the CyanogenMod hype train! :-P </TEXT>

He dutifully carries out The Patriots' orders to his last breath, offing Liquid, Solidus, and Ocelot/Liquid Ocelot, to protect the otherwise disgraced U.S. government from humiliation, to prevent a rebellion against his masters, and to ultimately protect and assure their ascension to total global domination, respectively.

His adversaries are extremely well constructed characters because of this, of course; we, as players, can eventually "get behind" them and their motive, which all serves to create an extremely engaging experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it was last Tuesday or thereabouts. I was listening to a live performance of Coldplay's *Fix You*, and in the middle of it, just before it picks up, Chris Martin asked aloud if everybody was okay. I just lost it. He leapt off the stage and into the crowd hugging random individuals all throughout the solo, and made it back on stage just in time to help the audience finish singing while he wrapped up on the piano.

It turns out this is something he seems to do at most gigs, and I can't help but think that it's a really sweet gesture.
