	<TEXT> I have something similar but with sandflies, which are basically fruitflies that suck blood. Happened like three or four times, the one on my elbow was the worst, it hurt to move it and it swelled up to cover the whole elbow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I think I had something like that happen once. Sometimes when it gets laggy or I don't have a strong GPS/Mobile signal. Only solution I found was a force restart. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could just as well be difficulty in transport. Not keeping the vaccines at a proper temperature during any point in the journey is going to reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. The countries mentioned are all not hugely developed countries, especially outside big cities and are all close to the Equator so they are especially prone to this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is HUGE! One of the biggest problems in before in getting a vaccine to non-developed areas like in Africa was keeping the vaccines cold enough during transport to still be effective. If more vaccines like these can be developed, 500,000 lives would seem almost like a small number. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is one of the main reasons we installed a security camera over the till. We are a small family business and we don't have till balancing. Since different bills are different colours it is easily identifiable on the cameras. My mom had that happen to their boss back when she was working. He just simply pulled up the camera footage and the customer just shut up and left. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on which paper you use. Rolls are generally flushable, but the cheap stacked rough paper is less so and probably the reason why they put it in a bin. Also, most public toilets don't provide toilet paper and you have to bring/buy your own which is generally like tissue packets and I don't think they are very flushable either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Collectible Sticker albums used to be all the rage when I was a kid, in Argentina. They pretty much had one (or more) for every popular cartoon/anime/kids show that was around. Haven't seen any even mentioned in other countries I've been. </TEXT>
