	<TEXT> Color can be misleading. Groundwater and mineral chemistry affects fossil color. They are certainly teeth of *C. megalodon*. One of the indicators is the prominent chevron or triangle shaped feature above the root. It's called a burlette. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Industrial runoff, agricultural runoff, iron in the water. Sewers emptied into the river pretty much unchecked in places. In the 1870's the mayor of Cleveland is quoted as saying the Cuyahoga was an open sewer flowing through the middle of the city. Today, thanks to the Clean Water Act, EPA, and Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, and countless unsung activists and concerned citizens, the Cuyahoga is cleaner than it has been in nearly two centuries. It is full of many pollution-sensitive species that would not have survived in the river of this photo. </TEXT>
