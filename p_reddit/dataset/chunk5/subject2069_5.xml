	<TEXT> It's not that humans care more about cats, it's just that:

A. Animals act on instinct, not malice, so if your cat did something humans deem as "bad" then beating it is unfair and doesn't accomplish anything.

B. The cat was not involved in your girlfriends infidelity.  So beating it shows the beater to be an immoral human.  Beating women is obviously bad, but the reason courts even consider crimes of passion is because the capacity for those exist in humans. Seeing your girlfriend cheat and running off and smashing her cat is calculated and cruel. </TEXT>

Also, I'd do further research on any topic that I have a vested interest in - whether pregnant women can sit in first class of a rail company, in a country I don't live in is not high on my priorities list.

Source saying this particular train was declassified at the time of her travel?

Also, my original point holds true - the guy I replied to was telling someone to read this article and quoting a line, when the very next line from the article to that which he quoted says something that counters his point entirely.

Say you wait 6 tables in an hour and each tips you this universal minimum, you've just made $30/hour. If you did this minimum each hour, not including your base salary, you'd be getting 60k a year. Obviously in some restaurants they split tips, but also on average I'm sure you'd do more than 6 tables and if this was the universal minimum you'd also get more from most customers, so the $30/hour figure isn't too far off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disagree with you on many fronts here:

1.  Tipping isn't a big thing here in the U.K. And our cost of eating out is pretty in line with yours, so I doubt paying a little more would push prices up. Yes, if just one restaurant tried to pay more they'd try push their prices up to compensate. But if the whole system changed and did it, as soon as one restaurant tried to push their prices up then people would just eat elsewhere. 

Plus, if you're expecting like 20% tips then there's a pretty big margin there for food to get more expensive and cost the consumer no more than they're paying anyway.

2. Good / bad service shouldn't mean your reward is scaled. If you're good at your job the reward should be keeping your job, if you're fundamentally bad at your job, you probably shouldn't have that job. 

Also, your point that it creates accountability isn't true where the culture is also such that you're expected to tip regardless. Bad service should = no tip if this were to work. I had a post in /AskReddit about tipping and one guy said even when he gets poor service he feels too guilty to not tip.

	<TEXT> Yeah I'm Scottish. The process was alright, actually. I tried to get a place like 2 years ago and was turned down because I had no credit history - I.e. I'd never been in debt in my life, which means they were unsure if I'd be able to handle debt. It's quite silly as having never been in debt, it should show that I can handle my finances. So I bought a motorbike on credit and paid it off over a year to raise my credit rating. After that I had to make sure I had a deposit (10% of mortgage value) + 3k for lawyers fees etc, then I was good to go. Saw one place I fell in love with, shmoozed the seller a bit, put in an offer and negotiated for her to leave a lot of furniture and here I am a year later!

Interest rate at the moment here is quite low, I got mine at 2.7%. I took a 30 year mortgage and repayments are initially weighted as a lot more interest than actual repayments, but if I overpay by 40% or so every month it'll bring my mortgage down by 15 years, so I sit that extra money aside every month to make sure nothing crops up (like redundancy!) and then pay it at the end of each year, or so the plan is.

Yeah, all my previous flats I rented have been white walled, beige carpeted ones too. The week I got my keys myself and my girlfriend came in and stripped all the wallpaper and painted the shit out of the place! I also tried my hand at building a big (8 metre +) flower planted in the back garden! 

If you were worried about repaying you could always get a two bed and rent out a room? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I love it! I rented with a friend before so it was fun having a room mate, but I was paying 400 a month rent and trying to save 1000 a month towards an apartment - now I own a place I just need to pay my mortgage (which is essentially money in the bank, minus the large interest) and save a lot less!

Also, it's fun being able to paint it decorate however you want! And just knowing you own a home is pretty nice!

I lost my job like 3 months after I got my flat, so that was a tiny bit stressful but I got a new one pretty quickly so that was lucky - would've been screwed if I couldn't get one in the longer term!

I'd say the pros are everything except that it sort of ties you down and means you need a recurring income for the next 25/30 years without exception, which is quite daunting!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, a question:

If you could get paid, say, $15 an hour but nobody tipped, or $2 an hour but you had to rely on tips - which would you choose? 

And I do agree completely with what you're saying. It just seems like when you're saying "when you tip you need to factor in how hard I work, how hard chefs work, how hard bartenders work" the phrase "when you tip" should be substituted for "when your employer pays you" - in literally every other job and industry your paid based/promoted based on your effort and typically harder/better workers earn more. 

Also, the service industry is one of the only industries where tipping in generally expected. 

Why is it that a server deserves a tip for doing their job but a cashier at a store doesn't, or your garbage man doesn't, etc? Other than saying your wages are low, which is surely your employers responsibility, not your customers?

Not arguing, by the way, just trying to get a servers thoughts on these things! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the informative and balanced answer!

Don't get me wrong, I do think American servers should get good tips (in U.K. they earn the same wages as everybody else in similar industries so it's not so vital here), but it was specifically the percentage thing I was asking about.  From your example above it sounds like you deserved $30+ tip. But say you were generally happy with 20% tips, in your above example 20% would have still only been $16 for 5 hours for 2 people, aka $1.60 per person per hour. Shouldn't tips just be a lump sum based on performance, effort, time etc, it shouldn't factor in what the customer specifically ate or drank (except quantity, which again would come under time and effort)?

Also, I'm sure you are lovely, but when servers always mention how they ask about people's day, ask how they are, etc - that's just common courtesy, something I've done in every job I've ever had and in general life. You shouldn't feel that you should be reimbursed for talking to your customers? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I semi see where you're coming from, except yeah, it's the customers who foot the bill - plus, your analogy is slightly off as a good salesman will bring in customers and maximise sales - it's not like servers are outside the restaurant roping you in, and other than dessert or sides it's not like they up-sell:

"I'll have a burger"
"Are you suuuuure you don't want the lobster and caviar?"

It just seems so weird to me that servers can be annoyed at customers for not supplementing their income as opposed to being annoyed at their employer for paying them $2 an hour. 

Plus, even then, what's the minimum wage in America (I honestly have no idea, let's assume it's $8). So if you serve 6 customers in an hour and each tipped $1, you'd be up at earning minimum wage - why do servers assume they should earn much more than that? Is being a server a massively more complex/difficult job than comparable minimum wage jobs such as grocery store employee, a cleaner, etc?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But then why do you tip at all if they're not attentive or absentee? If the service wasn't good what are you actually tipping them for? If you paid a guy to wash your car and he brought it to you dirty you wouldn't pay him, let alone tip him?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely get that - my question is specifically related to gauging a "good" vs "bad" tip as a percentage of your customers spend.

Like, say you spent ten mins on two customers where one had a much more expensive meal but both customers tipped $10. Would you be annoyed at the guy who had the expensive meal if that wasn't a high percentage of his total bill? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was listening to a podcast today and it had some waitresses who were annoyed their customers were "only" tipping 15%. 

It got me thinking - that's a completely arbitrary scale to go by? Like whether a guy orders a $50 steak or a $5 omelette or whatever, your job as a server involves saying hi, asking what he wants, taking it to him and saying bye - why do you feel you deserve $10 from steak guy and $1 from omelette guy (provided you're happy with 20% tip) for the exact same service? 

Of course it might be a gauge of how well off the customer is financially, or just what they fancied eating that day, but again, none of that is your concern as a server? </TEXT>

As somebody said above, you pretty much have to go out your way to consume this many calories and not exercise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. Especially as, for someone her size, walking about it essentially 10x more strenuous than it is for someone who isn't morbidly obese. Her muscles have to work harder, she burns more calories doing little things than someone much smaller.

The guy saying that it's a misconception that exercise causes weight loss is most definitely wrong. Yes, diet  exercise. But, as I said, provided her diet doesn't change to compensate, doing any exercise she doesn't currently do, with result in weight loss. To be at her current weight her body requires X amount of calories - Y amount of exercise, so if X remains the same and Y increases her net weight reduces. </TEXT>
