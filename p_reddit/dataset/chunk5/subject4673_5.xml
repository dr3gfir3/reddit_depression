	<TEXT> Sorry i wasn't thinking when i wrote the title. It is the curious case of benjamin button. My bad. Brain fart! When I first watched it, i was blown away by the cinematography, special effects and everything. This movie gets me every time. It is a powerful and beautiful movie. It is a hard movie to explain to people. I think it is an epic movie about love, loss and the hardships of Benjamin. Cate blanchett is so beautiful and she has that old hollywood look. Brad pitt and cate blanchett are a match made in heaven. David fincher is one of the best. I always enjoy his movies. He really puts his heart and soul in his projects. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it got crap reviews and people said it wasn't funny but I thought it was pretty funny. Basic plot but you can't go wrong with gal gadot and isla fisher in lingerie. Predictable and straight forward but loads of fun. It was good to see patton oswalt in a movie too after everything he has been through. It had some fun moments. You can tell gal was a for israeli soldier, she is strong and can hold her own. She is just so stunning. Jon hamm was pretty good in it. I want to see him in more movies. Makes me want to try snake wine and eat snake. Zach Galifianakis was funny as usual. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>
