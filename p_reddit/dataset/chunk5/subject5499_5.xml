	<TEXT> FOR THE DOUGH
4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup (1 stick) cold butter, cut into small pieces
1 cup cold water
1 large egg, lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon water (do not beat until ready to bake)

Make the dough: In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Using your fingers, cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Add just enough cold water so dough comes together. Roll out and cut rounds. You can crimp them with a fork after putting filling in and then use a egg wash on them and bake at 400F for about 30-40 min until the color you like

After doing this though it is much easier to use frozen Goya premade empanada dough or even puff pastry. </TEXT>
