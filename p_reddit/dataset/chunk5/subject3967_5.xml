	<TEXT> I'd stay in Capitol Hill. Upper QA is lovely, but it doesn't have the same energy. Considering you're from NYC, you're probably going to crave the same grit/energy as Manhattan. Capitol Hill is probably the better bet for that "feel". For the record, I've lived in LQA (backside by SPU) and spent a good amount of time on UQA. I currently live on the Pike/Pine corridor, it's definitely more "lively". Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rival is going to be your best bet. I've been a member of Rival for roughly 2 years. They have 4 squat (power) racks and a set of olympic weights (bounce). It's small, but will meet all your needs. I know lots of folks at Foundation. It's probably the best Crossfit gym in the city (I'm obviously biased here). I don't think they allow "free gym time", you have to do the classes.

I made a comment on some other gyms here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/44tw4g/finding_a_decent_gym/czsyfr6

Good luck, PM me with questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only lift I ever really did (or see others do) were deadlifts. It was noisy, but no trainer/employee ever came over to stop anyone from doing it. It's a relatively small space, so I don't recommend cleaning, jerking, and tossing the weight towards the mirror like in some other gyms.

	<TEXT> Yea I get it. Finding a good gym is important to me, not so much to others. If I find a good gym, I'm a loyal member for at least 2-3 years. That said, I've only been a long-time member of a couple of gyms, so I can only speak on the pros/cons of each of those:

**24 Hour Fitness Yale**

Pros:

* entire floor dedicated to cardio
* dedicated weightlifting floor with 2 squat racks (1 power rack)
* olympic style weights in a corner

Cons:

* super crowded at peak times
* not as posh as the Northgate one (this can be a pro as well, as the weightlifting area is all business, no frills)

**Rival Fitness on Capitol Hill**

Pros:

* indoor turf area (nice for athletic training)
* 4 (YES FOUR) squat racks, all of which are power cages
* olympic style weights

Cons:

* very little variety of cardio (treadmills, step mill, and bikes)
* little to no weightlifting machines (shit like Smith machines)
* small as hell

**24 Hr Fitness in Northgate**

Pros:

* large cardio area with lots of different machines (and TVs)
* decent free weight area, 2 squat racks (1 power rack)

Cons:

* super crowded at peak times
* no olympic weights (though I see people deadlift with standard plates anyway...)

**Harbor Square in Edmonds**

Pros:

* olympic style weights
* big facility, plenty of parking
* pretty much everything (pool, tennis court, basketball court, racquetball, etc.)

Cons:

* lots of old people (not much of a con, but worth mentioning)
* far away, Edmonds

All opinion, and these are only things that come off the top of my head. If you have any questions about each one, feel free to PM me. Good luck, stay healthy.

*edit: I tried to format it so it's readable but gave up half way, fuck it. PM me if you have questions.* </TEXT>

If it's accomplishing these things, then I'm guessing it's enough. Seems to be making a positive difference in your life. That's healthy.

If you eventually want to run a triathlon, then you might want to take it to the next level and actually start a running program. A quick Google search brought me [here](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/cms/category.asp?catid=28 authorid=0 page=1 spp=15).

Good luck.  </TEXT>

If you really only want one shoe for both, I'd recommend a minimalist shoe like Inov8 FLite 195. That's the shoe I use, it has a 3mm drop, which is flat enough for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the issues I've had while running on the beach is being extra careful with my ankles. When I run on concrete, it's kind of mindless, just hit the pavement. However, with sand (or trail) running, I have to be more cognizant of where I'm stepping.

An advantage would be working muscles you otherwise wouldn't be working while hitting pavement. </TEXT>

 Try turning off your onboard graphics in yout bios

How would I do a "proper" sweep of the driver? Just completely uninstall it in the Applications list? Or are there files I have to delete as well?

	<DATE> 2016-01-24 12:03:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know there have been some threads on the Steam forum regarding performance issues with Nvidia cards in the past, but I was looking to see if there are any recent updates on the issue I'm having. I'm averaging very low FPS (8-12) in a city of a population ~50k on highest settings.

I don't think my system is being pushed to the max:

* Intel i5-4440 (3.1Ghz)
* GTX 970
* 8GB Ripjaws

* Windows 10 Home 10.0.10586 B 10586
* Nvidia Driver 10.18.13.6143

Here's a screenshot of my monitors, GPU-Z and Resource Monitor: http://i.imgur.com/fX6otEH.png 

I've tried the following with little to no improvement (~3 FPS gain?):

* forced DX9 through 'Launch Options'
* rolled back my Nvidia driver to previous release
* unparked my CPUs
* ran in compatibility mode for Windows 8, then 7
* re-installing the game

No assets, mods, etc. Pure vanilla game.

Any ideas on why this might be happening? Any help at all would be appreciated, thanks!
 
**UPDATE (1/25/2016):** A fresh install of Windows 10 did the trick. If you upgraded from 8.1 or 7, wipe the HD and re-install if you're having performance issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For 3 years, I ran and lifted in [Merrell Trail Gloves](http://www.merrell.com/US/en/trail-glove-3/17571M.html). When these went to shit, I purchased a pair of [Inov-8 F-Lite 195s](http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-FLite-195-Black-Lime-Azure.html). The 195s are a 3mm drop, which isn't terrible. I'm not too sure about the grip, but I haven't slipped in them yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bro answer: clothes don't make you lift any heavier, wear whatever the hell you want. 

MFA answer: I really like Nike's running dri-fit tops. I also have some of Target's workout brand tops as well (C9?) if you're looking for cheaper options. I wear mostly Nike shorts, but I'll also wear any old pair. For shoes, I have a dedicated pair of Asics for running and a pair of [Inov8 F-Lite 195s](http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-FLite-195-Black-Lime-Azure.html) for light jogs and weightlifting.

I hear a lot of good things about Lululemon tops, thought they are quite pricey.

	<TEXT> Cautious optimism, the Seahawk fan's motto... I agree, but I think, if anything, it shows that he has the ability and confidence to make those types of throws. Yes, it was against arguably bad secondaries, but it still takes a good QB to execute those kinds of plays.

It also helps that the run game is something opposing defenses will have to respect moving forward, even without Lynch. Thank you, Rawls! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. I've actually learned a lot playing Madden. Especially on the offensive side of things. What to look for pre-snap: using motion to detect man vs zone, CBs in press, LB blitz reads, etc.

Can't say the same for defense though. I always just rush the QB with the DE, lol. </TEXT>
