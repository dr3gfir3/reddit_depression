	<TEXT> As an Ebarb user himself, agreed.

I will always say it, at the risk of kids downvoting me for using EB (this has actually happened before)

# EB aren't hard to counter

A skeleton army plus mirror is my enemy (-1)

Ice Golem + Musk + Ice Spirit (-1)

Wizard + Ice Golem (-1)

Rocket. Fucking rocket. (0)

Pekka (-1)

Tornado + Ice Spirit (bonus points if you actually activate the king tower with them, +2)


And I can go on. People are overblowing this situation more than it should be. I can understand the idea of the RG being OP af, but the EB?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The S8, G6, Xperia XZ, OnePlus (4?

Do people seriously think these companies started manufacturing their phones in September? 

The S8 (per reports) started development even before the S7 was released. Samsung never knew Apple will not include the jack. 

Same applies to LG, HTC, and other companies when they release their flagship devices. 

In the case of the HTC Ultra, there is no way they developed that phone in just two months. So it took it from Motorola, who released their "no-jack" phone on July </TEXT>

 Why does it need a buff?

 For 7 elixir it's the only card that can't take a tower by itself (I'm fine with this, not all tanks should take a tower

Glad you know that ("not all tanks should take a tower") The Hound is supposed to be a tank. It serves the same purpose in CoC. In CoC, people use it to have building tackle it while other troops destroy it. 

  It has low health

For a tank is fine. The pups could use a tiny tiny buff in HP, but is not necessary. 

 Has very few synergies

I'm not sure a buff will fix this. However, for the Hound's purpose, it doesn't need a lot of Synergies. Remember, the Hound is mainly a support/tank card. Think the lavalloon. Who makes the most damage and it is untouched until after the Hound is destroyed? The Balloon. 

 Isn't a threat at all by itself and is easy to counter. 

I wouldn't say it is easy to counter. Is the Giant easy to counter? And of course it isn't a threat. Refer to point 1.

 Has MULTIPLE hard as fuck counter

So does every troop. Trick is to kill these counters so the Hound can keep living. Use a rocket or Lightning

 EVEN worse when one tower is taken because of it's bullshit pathing

As a Hound user, I agree with this.
