	<TITLE> Decadence AZ - Weather/stage/shuttle question </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-14 09:18:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, all! 

I've never been to Decadence before, or really any winter night time event. (I'm used to 100 degree EDC or indoor smaller venues for artist shows, there is no in between for me lol) 

What's the weather like in AZ around then? I've heard the stage is indoors, is this true? Is it super hot inside? I have no idea what to expect for this and what to wear. Also, has anyone done the package with them with the certain hotel where you get to ride a free shuttle? What's that like? Again, I'm used to EDC and the shitshow that is that shuttle system, so I'm betting it's better than LV but is it good enough to warrant booking that specific hotel? 

Fianc and I are going for our five year dating anniversary because this lineup is full of a bunch of our all-time favorites. Also we're old and we don't do anything for NYE most years anyway, so this was a good excuse, haha. Can't wait! :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the idea of the smaller garland! A suggestion - if you're not super attached to the idea of a veil but maybe want one, what about a simple one for the ceremony only? A single layer of tulle clipped to the back of a garland like this would be simple and pretty and you could take the veil off after the ceremony to show off the back of the dress.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They did something like this at my school every few years - not every year because then kids would catch on. They always picked one kid to "die" - usually someone well liked, not super popular, someone sweet and friendly. And they would go for a week or two like this. The kid couldn't tell their friends. The story was they were either driving while on their phone or with someone who was. One year I think they had a kid "die" because he got high with his friends and thought he was okay to drive. Brutal. But I'll be damned if it didn't at least make ME think twice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really want to have a discussion about numbers vs numbers, it's already making me uncomfortable just posting this, but due to a crazy family situation (both parents divorced and remarried, my grandmother basically raised me, FH and I are putting a big chunk of money into this) our budget is around $32k. It seems like an ungodly amount of money and it absolutely is. But as someone who previously claimed "I'll never spend more than $10k on a wedding", I was pleased to find that our family all really wanted to contribute (with the exception of my father, which... Ugh) and that we'd have a little more financial freedom. 

But either I let it get to my head or I severely underestimated the cost of a wedding. Probably a bit of both. We're getting married near Temecula, CA - just north of San Diego. It's an expensive area and vendors are mostly all pricey. We knew we wanted high quality food and photos, and our venue costs $6k because it's a full weekend rental (four days, with accommodations for 19 and tons of cabins on property for additional cost). After food, venue, and photographer, we're already at $17k. For less than a hundred people! Our food cost works out to $100 per person (again, we really wanted really nice food) 

I feel like my panic is amplified because I've never seen this much money in my life. Neither FH or I come from wealthy families - we're hard workers contributing $10k ourselves, and our four other contributors are pretty evenly split with the rest of the budget. My family was dirt poor growing up, and my mom has gone on to get a nice job and my grandma has had a few thousand saved up for this since I was little. FH's family is good about managing their money but not obscenely wealthy or anything. 

I mean, I could buy a nice car for this much money. It could be a decent down payment on a house. But our families are supportive of us having our dream wedding - only, every little tiny decision and tweak and adjustment can mean a couple thousand dollars shifting priorities. And as a bride who isn't used to money, there's a ton of pressure on me - admittedly, mostly my own worries about financial contributors not being happy with choices we make when they're giving us so much. The only person I have really heard any negative feedback from has been my FMIL (that's a whole other story) but I'm stressed out anyway. FH and I have a fairly specific vision for our wedding, fairly non-traditional and a little eclectic. I know not everyone has to love every aspect. Doesn't change the pressure on every decision. 

And EVERYONE feels like they want to be involved. With everything. FH thinks his mom isn't involved enough, but she was with us when we picked out venue and she paid the deposit (even after I asked her not to). We haven't done much else. I explained it to him like this: we're allowed to bring three people with us to our catering tasting. Three. Guess how many people have said they want to go?  Nine. Obviously, everyone can't be part of everything. 

I'm about ready to tell everyone to keep their money and let us elope. As much as I'm grateful for the help, when it comes with this kind of pressure attached, it's also a burden. 

I know this sounds like a spoiled, entitled rant. But I don't want it to. I'm not used to this much money. I could never handle being rich. Ugh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to agree with the general consensus here - give her a brow product. But I'm going to suggest powder instead of a pencil - pencil can take several tries to get used to and the creamier formulas settle into the fine lines on some older ladies I know. A soft, neutral powder is easy to brush on and doesn't require too much blending. 

Also, because she wears glasses, I suggest a fun liner (I like the blue! Maybe green?) or a fun, sheer lip color. Anything too opaque, again, settles really easily and is more obvious. Something more sheer is easier to apply but can build up a little if desired. someone here suggested the UD Vice lipsticks - they have tons of sheer finish shades (my favorite right now is Sheer Ladyflower!) so that she can have a bright pop of color with minimal effort. 

Agreed with cream blush too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was supposed to be my date, until we realized my grandma was booked on a cruise. Whoops. Luckily our venue was fine with changing. 

Now we are on the 9th (9/9!) but I had to tell you what my cute ass fianc did. We were standing in the kitchen the day before our One Year to Go and he's like "we should go out tomorrow" and I'm like "why??" Because I am dumb and also the worst. So he says "because tomorrow is 9/9. One year to go. It's like an anniversary but backwards. It's like..." 

And then like a moment from a really dumb movie or something, we look at each other and we're like "it's like a reverse anniversary. A Reversary." Which is some super gross shit we do all the time. Ew. 

So go, friends! Celebrate your Reversary with a date or beer or pizza or whatever works. Enjoy!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very rarely do I drag myself down to the point of calling a minor an asshole, but wow. What an absolute dick move. I'm not going to shame you guys like some other commenters, that's pointless, but I'm going to weigh in all the same.

As someone who used to trade "that's not mine!" Or "it's not my fault!" Punishments with my sister in a similar matter, and whose parents didn't do shit about it, I'm urging you to make a quick and significant gesture to your younger son. 

Older kid, in my opinion, gets this: twice the amount of time grounded. Minimum. Phone taken away. If you absolutely need to get a hold of him, buy him one of those dorky little kids phones where he can only call the numbers you program in. Maybe a sparkly pink or purple one. Any major electronics and events for the next several months are no longer his. 

The thing that got me most was that he was acting disappointed in his brother, then laughed the whole thing off. 14 is too young for that to happen to a kid and not really, really hurt. 

Younger son? He is gonna need a really, really nice new present. And you know what? It's not really all your fault that the grounding happened, though it's certainly some of it. Personally, I'd help younger kid get something cool. Laptop? Camera? Xbox? I don't know what the kids are into these days. But don't just pay for it yourself and ground the older kid. Find a family friend or a local business that's willing to hire older kid part time. He can start his first day of "work" the day you take younger kid to get his gift. Take the kid to lunch wherever he wants, get ice cream, whatever. Tell older kid that he is going to give 100% of his pay checks towards paying for little brother's present until it is paid in full, and then towards paying for his own outpatient rehab and/or therapy. Your kid has some issues if he's willing to go MONTHS of watching his younger sibling suffer, plus adding to that suffering by pretending to be so disappointed in the younger brother. He hid that box under brother's bed for a reason - he WANTED him to get in trouble. He knew this might eventually happen and decided he'd rather watch his younger sibling suffer than accept punishment for his own shortcomings. 

Lastly, I am so sorry this is happening to you. I cannot imagine being in this position as a parent. I was a hellion myself as a teenager, though I wasn't mixed up with drugs or alcohol at that age. I was just an asshole. Being older grants me the gift of retrospect, which makes me a little embarrassed for myself. Hopefully older kid will be too, eventually. You were right to jump to a strict punishment for weed like that, especially so since you believed it was a 14 year old's, but failing to take into consideration that it could have been someone else's (and not having proof that it was younger kids) was a slip up that you know you'll have to work through.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad and I were really close growing up. My mom was/is mentally unstable and not easy to be around. She's better now, but I was much closer with my dad when I was younger. He has his fair share of problems, I'll get to that in a sec. When he and my mom finally divorced five years ago, he almost immediately moved two hours away, married a new woman with two daughters just like my sister and I, and stopped trying to have a relationship with me or my sister. We'd do the obligatory Christmas visit and stuff, and for a while we went out there fairly often, but he just stopped trying. After several years, I stopped too - it's exhausting being in college and working and trying to keep up any semblance of a social life, let alone chasing after a relationship with a father who doesn't give a shit. 

My dad is a pathological liar. He's a horrible communicator and he's said awful things about me, my mom, and my sister for several years now - like my mom is brainwashing us to hate him, that we never call him (phone goes both ways!) and that we don't ever come see him. Uh. We chase after him to make plans. He always says he'll call or text and doesn't. He threw a fit on Christmas Eve because for the last three years or so I had gone to his house, but this last year he never invited us over or even asked if we'd be there, so we had to split the night with my fiance's dad's family. We still drove two fucking hours out there on Christmas Eve because we wanted to see him. But he was all pouty and that doesn't count because we should have just KNOWN we were invited and just shown up. Uh. 

He also gave me money once when money was tight for me. Less than a thousand dollars. Insisted that I never pay him back. That it was a gift, that he was glad to help. Then a year later called, after he quit yet another job, to ask when I was paying him back that money. I reminded him it had been a gift, but that if he really needed money I could afford to give him less than $100 a month. I have medical bills to pay and rent and bills. He just stopped answering me after that. He called back a few months later like nothing was wrong, and I found out that that's only because my fianc secretly drove two hours out of his way, took a half day off work, went to my dads house (coincidentally on my dads birthday a few years ago, the selfish hack probably thought my fianc was bringing him a present) and wrote my dad a check for the money back, and told him to quit treating me like crap over money. (I do love my fianc dearly, but had he mentioned this to me before doing it, I would have told him not to waste his time/money, that it wouldn't last long.) sure enough, a few months later, he stopped inviting us over again. But he still acted friendly most of the time. 

Basically, I was the mediator. Mom needed paperwork signed? I told him to call her. Sister hadn't seen him in a while? I called him to make dinner plans. He's driven out here all of three times to see us. Just in the first year after he left, we drove out there probably fifteen or twenty times. So in February, I had my engagement party. He showed up! And the next weekend, he helped me move! 

And then I didn't hear from him until June, when I texted him for Father's Day (I was out of town anyway so couldn't have made plans if I wanted to) and he swore he'd call me back to make plans when he knew they were free. Nope. 

So since February I haven't seen him at all and have only texted once for about ten minutes. 

I felt like I'd finally given up. That I was done chasing after a relationship with my father if he didn't give a shit about me. I don't really believe that he doesn't care about me at all, but he's a selfish, immature little brat. 

I recognize that my description of him is really shitty. He's done some really shitty things. But I do still love him and I know he's not all bad, just very very immature. I have made sure not to make plans on his birthday just in case he decides to invite us over for whatever he's planning this year. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to buckle and be the facilitator again. But I don't want to just stop talking to my dad entirely because he's being fucking stupid. I haven't talked to him too much about it because I don't want to ruin anything when we do actually see him. I'm getting married. He's definitely not walking me down the aisle but I also do want him there. 

Anybody have any ideas for breaching the accidental NC barrier and the topic of communication while still putting the ball in his court? I can't keep chasing and chasing. It's exhausting. 

Tl;dr lesser of two evils but still immature turnip NDad has drifted out of my life and I sort of want to contact him or see him around his birthday but also maybe not  </TEXT>

"He just thinks that because she wasn't thinking maliciously, I shouldn't be pissed off." 

This is the kind of behavior my FH was guilty of until we started managing it in therapy. He would claim that his mother had good intentions, so why was I upset? Ever heard that saying, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions?" Sort of applies here. Even if his mommy dearest was only suggesting this second wedding (that you offered before and she shut down) because her siblings are old and don't want to travel, she's missing the point of how much stress that puts on you and FH. If she wants this second event, after she told you no the first time, she can plan it and pay for it herself. 

Now, my FMIL is also a cracker eating quack, but not evil. I am well-versed in the ways of not wanting things to blow up but needing to be firm. 

Talk to FH, and with his permission, send an email from the BOTH of you stating that since you offered before and she seemed to not want two events, you planned and budgeted for only one event, and that that's where the money is going. It's already committed. Let her know that if she and her family don't attend that, that in a few months after the wedding, when everything is settled, she can host a party to get her family together to celebrate the wedding they missed. But that you'll be planning for the wedding that you thought everyone wanted, and the second party is up to her. 

Same with the future infant. No way in hell are you dragging a baby on a plane full of germs several times a year. When that comes around, offer to help pay for her airfare to come visit you as a present. Reasonable accommodations.

	<TEXT> Firstly - listen to the voicemail. It sounds unlikely, but your mom could have had a change of heart. 

If that's not the case, you need to be firm with her - their divorce happened almost two decades ago. Dad's girlfriend is family now too, she's been around for a long time, it's not fair to tell her she can't come when she's been so inviting and welcoming to you for so long. You want her there. That's that. 

And more than that, tell her that what she's doing is effectively making you choose between inviting your mom or your dad to your wedding and leaving the other one out. Tell her that that's completely unfair of her, and that her asking you to do that on the most important day of your life is frustrating and hurtful. She needs to know that you are NOT going to be making that decision. You're inviting all parties because all parties deserve to be invited. If she chooses not to come, that's on her. Offer to make reasonable accommodations - she can sit on the opposite side of the room, they won't have to talk to each other, whatever. But you're not going to choose. 

My fianc and I both have divorced and remarried parents. My stepmom is a bit of a handful and my dad is a pathological liar so naturally we've had drama with my stepmom refusing to be cordial with my mom before she's even met her. They met (and they got along fine) because I gave all parties a stern warning - get along and behave, or everyone can be escorted out. Ended up fine. 

You are in charge here. Not them. Your dad and his girlfriend have done nothing wrong, and the fact that he was willing to have that conversation and uninvite the girlfriend the first time shows he's more committed to trying than your mom. If she can't suck it up for a day, her loss. Harsh, maybe, but don't let her force you into making that decision. 

ETA: How are they going to handle things when you have kids, if that's in your plan? Having little people in the mix can change any routines you've had for the last several years. You can split holidays sure, what about birthdays? Graduations? This problem will persist unless you stop it now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My 3YO crazy person had the best response to a guy cutting us off on a totally empty street. She wasn't quite three when this happened. 

"I'm gonna hit him! I'm gonna get a hockey stick and I'm gonna hit him and hit him and hit him until he's dead! Then I'm gonna bury his body in the ground and wait a long time, and when it's done, an apple tree is going to grow there! Then I'll have a snack!" 

I thought THAT was weird, until we got home and I was telling the story to DB. 3YO, sitting on the floor between us, hears me say "some jerk cut us off" and she says "Yeah! F*ckin' Asshole!" 

I was like "wait, she didn't get that from me..." And that's how I learned that "Daddy says bad words sometimes and 3YO is a parrot" 

We were also at Target once after Christmas, each kid checking out their ONE thing separately because they had their own money. It's not busy but this lady behind us is complaining like we're taking an hour in the only open lane. 

3YO, who is sitting in the cart,  hears her say "these kids are taking forever" and leans around me, looks at the lady, and says "Hey! F*ck you!" 

I try to stammer out an apology but I can't manage it and the lady just says "oh, okay, it's fine" and doesn't say another word.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! Just focused on healthier foods - bought a funny vegan cookbook and ate mostly vegan for a week just to practice switching up my proteins. I already ate fairly healthy some of the time but I would binge all the time. I haven't binged in over three weeks. I had a tendency before this to try and jump straight into strict calorie counting and working out five times a week and I'd burn out in days. This time I'm taking my time and finding foods and exercises I like.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, all! 

Reposting some things I posted several months ago. I am getting married in a little less than a year (woo!) and also I just have way too much stuff at this point. 

If there are things in the verification album that aren't on this list, they're gone - that includes the entirety of the ColourPop lot. It's all sold. I'm just on an app right now waiting for a doctor's appointment and can't edit the imgur thing for some reason. 

Minimum purchase of $10 before shipping.

Shipping starts at $3 and increases with weight/number of items. Tracking will be provided as soon as I can ship. I ship within 48 hours of the time I receive payment. If you'd like rush shipping, let me know. I ship using bubble mailers and I wrap all items in at least one more layer of bubble wrap, two if the item is a little more fragile. If you'd like another method of shipping, feel free to ask - I can send a flat rate mailer and pack it with bubble wrap also for an additional fee.

Failure to pay within 24 hours will mean I release product back into sale. PayPal gift only, please. 

Most importantly - *MAKE ME AN OFFER!* None of these prices are concrete. I lowered almost everything this time around, but I'm willing to go even lower. 

All items marked FWP are also eligible to be, you guessed it, free with purchase. One FWP item per $20, please.

	<TEXT> Sort of depends on circumstances, doesn't it? And what I didn't mention in my comment is that I do all of the meal planning, grocery shopping, and meal prep in one day, which is time consuming and a way to help us get things done without it being cleaning or a real chore. Also, I'm disabled. So yeah, my fianc does the big work (he offered!) and I make up for it in other ways around the house. He asks nicely for me to pick up the random crap I leave around. That's all I'm saying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, playing Devil's Advocate because I'm a lot like your SO. I am chronically messy. My fianc is a neat freak. It took several years for us to find our groove with living together, but it finally boiled down to this - My SO could ask in a perfectly reasonable way for me to clean up. But because it's always been an issue before, I felt attacked or blamed. That made me just not want to do it. Fight starts. Repeat. 

I told him "just remind me nicely!" And he would say he would, but his reminders were usually frustrated before he even got a chance to mention it to me, so sometimes it came out a little clipped or blunt and, go figure, I didn't like that. Sometimes it's a little tone change. I fully admit that I'm sensitive about that kind of thing, and maybe your SO is. Or maybe not. 

Here's how we worked it out - my SO does a majority of the big chores - laundry and dishes and vacuuming. Stuff like that. But twice weekly, he's supposed to say a *scripted* line - "Hey, can we spend ten minutes picking up the apartment tonight?" 

That takes away any potential for being offended. It makes it a team effort. But it also makes it about accountability and working WITH your partner instead of a "my stuff/your stuff" argument. 

My fianc grew up in a neat and tidy house and doesn't own a ton of junk. I grew up in a disgustingly messy house - mold, mice, the whole deal. I used to get screamed at to do chores that weren't mine to do, or in the middle of the night. It took a long time to realize that it was really just a difference in upbringing, standards of living, and also me being a little sensitive. It takes a long time to break the habit of just being messy. Be patient, but absolutely tell him that you need to work together to fix this.

	<TEXT> Okay, as a fellow Chronically Ill Person, I am begging you to dump this jerk before you make the mistake of serious commitment. 

Here's how a partner SHOULD react to hearing their SO had a diagnosis like this. 

1. Ask questions. 
2. Be supportive. 
3. Come with you to appointments when possible. 
4. Make sure you're taking care of yourself. 
5. Be an advocate for you and your care. 
6. Not do any of the things your SO just did. 

My fianc was incredibly supportive and helpful from the get go. I offered him an "out" - he didn't sign up to be with a sick person, I didn't want him to feel guilty and stick around out of that guilt. He told me I was being crazy, of course he'd stay with me, and he wanted to know as much as possible. He has gone to appointments with me, held my hand and rubbed my face the ER, brought me pain meds and ice packs and heating pads and a stiff drink. 

A partner should be supportive through ALL things in your life. If this dude is crying wolf and being this much of an ass during a big challenge in your life, he's going to keep doing this. When you talk about getting married. When you have kids, if that's your thing. 

Call his bluff. Tell him you refuse to admit to something that you did not do, that if he's that scared of your diagnosis he can stay gone. You'll figure out the truth really quick - this dude is either cheating on you or he's a total coward.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My problem before was accountability. If I really didn't care about my weight, I would be cooking chicken piccata and unhealthy stuff for every meal, I'm a decent cook. I would eat healthy but binge every other weekend or so and feel like crap. And I also mentioned that I was potentially not eating enough, which is a problem for a few health issues I have. I just needed to find a system that had a good reputation. I do meetings with my mom too, so that's half my accountability right there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I was just trying to fill points at the end of the day. I wanted the wine anyway but I might have had half as much if I wasn't trying to meet the minimum. And as for breakfast, it's big! It's two jumbo egg white veggie muffins. I'm totally satisfied through lunch, or I might have a couple pieces of low sodium turkey for a snack. I think my problem is that I've been eating so low carb/high veggie/high lean protein for so long that I'm having trouble justifying adding high point items just to meet a quota. I basically worked out what I used to eat and I was eating about 1100-1400 calories depending on the day, but some of those days were only 15 points! I think my other thing is healthy fats. I was definitely not eating enough of those. Maybe adding some salmon and avocado and stuff into the mix will help.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Smart Points "Healthy Range" - what does it mean? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-21 06:50:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry if this is something obvious that I'm missing, I'm just starting out and just a bit confused about a few things. 

I'm supposed to get 33 points per week. Great! There's that "Healthy Range" calendar at the bottom of the app that states that my range is between 30 and 40 points per day. I'm trying to stick exactly to the plan, so I'm eating within that range. But as someone who has already been eating really healthy for several months before starting WW, I'm finding it hard to reach that 33 points! I weigh my food out to the gram, I've been liberal with things that might help me use up my points, but I had to have basically a fourth big meal at the end of the day for the last few days because I was only at 19 points. I know this is kind of a silly problem to have, but I'm concerned about what those points mean, calorie-wise, and how eating all this food is going to be beneficial to my weight loss. I'm having to eat twice as much to reach my points as I was eating before WW. 

Am I missing something? Is it that big of a deal if I don't meet 30 points per day? I'm assuming plenty of people go under their points range but it has been a concern for me before that when I decide to buckle down and eat healthy, I'm not eating enough. So I'm trying to meet my range, but I'm feeling like it's too much food. 

For example, here's my intake for today: 

Breakfast: 
Egg and veggie muffin (2) 
Fruit Cup (0)

Lunch: 
Chicken (1)
Chickpeas (2) 
Ranch (1) 
Millet (1) 

Dinner: 
Veggie "Lasagna" (6) 
White Wine (6) 

Fourth Meal: 
Almond milk (1) and cereal (4) 
Veggie "Lasagna" (6) 

That's 30 points. Calorie-wise, it looks... Okay? But I felt so full most of the day. And as you can tell, I had to eat ELEVEN points at the end of the night. 

Is there something I'm missing? Is it okay to be that far under at the end of the day?

	<TEXT> What is a hyperconservative male (another thing I see from your post history) even doing on this sub? Oh, right, you got linked here from a post complaining about this post. So you decided to waltz right in and accuse me of encouraging rape? What the actual fuck is wrong with you? This is a place that has (until you) been a supportive, light-hearted conversation about consent with sexual partners. Nowhere in here did anyone say "gee I wish some neckbeard would fly in and tell me I'm propagating rape culture because I wanted my partner to also give consent" 

What is wrong with you 

In no way have you been kind at all in this conversation. I don't owe you any kind of "explanation" for an anecdote I told online in a FEMALE-CENTRIC sub in a thread about support and consent. 

You wanted to make assumptions about me from my post history, I made a few about you. How about the one thing you didn't find in my post history? I am the survivor of a brutal sexual assault that left me with cracked vertebrae and a concussion. There is not a single cell in my body that would ever encourage rape or rape culture. You took a simple string of words in a post that had **nothing to do with you** and twisted them into something incredibly fucked up, just so you could go giggle back with your fellow neckbeards on SRSsucks. 

This is exactly time for ad hominem. You come to a female-centric sub and insult someone you yourself stated is a liberal feminist, insinuating that the person actually doesn't know what they're talking about and is encouraging rape. Uh. Please go lock yourself back in your basement somewhere and come back when you've thought that one out a bit more.  </TEXT>

I think it's so sweet that you are taking precious time out of your day full of fashioning tinfoil hats, raving about climate change being a myth, and the exhausting work of being a Trump fanboy to come tell me things that you think you know! I'm sure happy some random person on the interwebs swung by and granted me some of their infinite wisdom so that I might see that I am totally wrong about my own life! I only wish I had seen before that what I was doing by telling a story about my life was ACTUALLY looking for some hero to come tell me that I'm messing up! Oops! It was clearly a cry for help that I'm so glad you answered!

Say hi to your Orange Overlord for me, fuckboy!

	<TEXT> You've done what you can for now. The hiring process for Disneyland is notoriously slow at times. Because you applied in the middle of summer Peak season, they already had most of their seasonal cast members and likely didn't need to hire any new people for a while. When I applied I got lucky, I applied one night, got a call the next morning, went for an interview a few days later, and got hired on the spot. But a few of the friends I worked with had been applying over and over for several months. It depends on where they need people. They needed attractions cast at the time, so I got on quick. 

If it's in progress, they're looking through it. They'll get to you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yessss I love hearing other people's stories of this. My now fianc was a virgin when we met, almost five years ago. I was not. The night we first slept together, we were just making out and seemed to want more. And he's like "are you sure? It's up to you." And I was like "uh no given circumstances this is entirely up to you" and he just stopped and pulled back a few inches and he's like 

"No. No. Really. This is not just up to me. Do you really want to?" 

And I'm like, in my head, "this dude is gonna get it so good"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Purging is what we call the reaction some people have to certain new chemicals or treatments - basically, things that are a little stronger. Some people have a period where they have worse symptoms (usually worse acne) for up to a few months after they start the new product. So for example, some people who use Curology "purge" for two months or so when they first start using it, then their acne really clears up. I got lucky and my acne didn't get worse before it got better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a really similar turn of events. I used to get really bad acne on my cheeks/jaw/chin, finally stopped using abrasive products and just started using a gentle cleanser and moisturizer. 

However I did have a TON of luck with Curology. I was super scared about purging for a few months like some people do but I never did. I've been on it for just over a month now and my skin is already so much clearer! Have to reformulate to work on some texture issues but I have gone from 5-15 new pimples a week to one or two.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a really negative view of mental illnesses, and it would be a good idea for you to maybe educate yourself or consider context instead of passing judgement on someone you don't know. They never said that the state wouldn't give them a license, just that it was difficult for them to obtain one. Big difference. 

I didn't get my license until I was almost 21. I have fairly terrible anxiety issues which are great for nannying sometimes (I am always prepared for every possible problem and I'm hyper vigilant) but was not great for learning to drive a very heavy, very big, very dangerous vehicle for the first time. 

I am excellent with kids, my mom ran a daycare growing up, I have been a nanny for several years and babysat for several more before that. But driving a car was terrifying at first. It's a whole different ball game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> August has been a crazy month for our schedule - both I and the family were on different vacations for a week at the beginning of the month. I came back for a week and a half, I'm here today and Friday, then I'm gone for another week on a family vacation. Mom boss graciously offered to hire a one off, week long replacement so my fianc and I could go the whole week! Which is awesome. And then the day after I come back, the kids start school again, and thus ends their summer break and lets us go back to normal schedule - big kids in school during the day, I just have all three before and after school and toddler during the day. It's a great recipe for missing the last week of summer, which is usually full of too much energy and crazies. 

But all three kids have been freaking terrors for the last few days. They were crazy all last week when I was back, they've been crazy this week, and I'm sure they'll lay it on thick for this afternoon and Friday. 

I'm bribing them with a slurpee if they can keep it under control for a while, but who knows. 

The big guy, who is nine, has such an attitude today. And all days. He's old enough to know his behavior is crappy but he continues. It's infuriating. He's got some undiagnosed anger issues that he's seeing a therapist for and he likes to blame everything on that. He'll hit his sister over something stupid and say "I can't help it! It's my anger problem!" He's often rude and sometimes outright cruel to his little sisters and i am so done with it.  </TEXT>

Ask maybe your closest Colorado friend if they'd be up for helping you throw together a girls night out since your bachelorette was so far away and you'd like to celebrate with them too! 

My bridesmaids are mostly my sisters, and two of them won't be 21 by the time I'm getting married. So I'm doing a big trip with all the sisters and my two other bridesmaids to Disneyland for an overnight (complete with tutus and matching shirts) and then another weekend I'm doing a wine tasting weekend with a sleepover for my older friends and family. 

And I'm just mentioning it like that! "I got to celebrate with X already, I want to celebrate with you too, Y!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woo! That sounds like a party! Ours is small but we're still taking up the whole place. We're thinking 90% of our people will stay on property because it's kind of remote and there aren't a ton of other places that arent a ~20 minute windy mountain road in the dark. All of our party crowd is staying on property for obvious reasons ;) 

That's awesome! My family has been fairly helpful too and luckily a pocket of our family lives sort of in the area and has lots of good connections - so we'll be lucky when it comes time to find a caterer and stuff like that. I almost lived just outside London, but I ended up staying stateside because I was just starting to date this guy, and it looked like things were going really well. Now we're getting married, so I like to think I made the right choice. We can always travel together later!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I figured I would start one! And it seems like it's predominately mountains and outdoors, which is awesome. 

We don't have a ton of friends (lol) and our closest friends are like... A couple that got married eight years ago in another state and a bunch of singles. But my uncle just got married in March and my new aunt who I adore has been super helpful and basically offered a bunch of her decor stuff to us (really nice stuff we'll totally use) plus their photographer is a family friend who is going to give us a good deal and does amazing work. And that uncle is going to be our officiant. So I guess we have a liiiiittle more planned than just our venue. 

Dress shopping is the thing I'm most nervous about. 

CA is a great state! Born and raised here and I only get the urge to move about once a year :P but it's so diverse, in terms of sights to see, and we love it. Come honeymoon out here! Lots of wine, breweries, forests, great camping and B and Bs, all kinds of stuff.

The place we booked basically feels like a camp though - there's a big main house that sleeps 19, a dozen or so cabins and tent cabins, ten tent camping spots, and like acres of land. It's so beautiful and it is secluded and exactly what we wanted. 

I can't imagine planning a wedding from a different country. As it is, mine is 3 hours away and I have to plan a full weekend day or a weekend to go meet with vendors and stuff. Still worth it.  </TEXT>

It's an appreciation of a piece of clothing and an idea about how else it could be used. They were discussing the different forms of that top. 

I've seen people all over this sub comment about hair and jewelry and tops and dresses all the time. Part of talking about makeup is talking about how it plays up the other parts of our outfits or accessories. "This goes great with that!" Is common. -15 net votes is not warranted for a comment about a shirt. It happens here every day.

I actually tried on dresses once a few months ago. Im going to start really looking again because I know it's going to take me forever, but I actually really liked one of the first ones I tried on. I have a super hourglass figure with unfortunately wide hips compared to my waist and broad shoulders/big chest so dresses are proving difficult unless they're a corset/ball gown/a line type thing, which I'm not really into.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! FH and I got engaged in December 2015, on our four year dating anniversary. We knew right away that there was a specific feel and structure we wanted for our wedding. We're both outdoorsy and life time scouts, we didn't want to spend a bunch of money on an eight hour event so we wanted a full weekend kind of deal, hopefully in the mountains, where we could spend quality time with friends and family. It took us several months to find our place, but we finally booked our venue a week and a half ago, so we finally have our date! September 9th, 2017. Woo! 

We live just south of Los Angeles and have a very non-traditional family structure (both sets of parents divorced and remarried, lots of siblings and step siblings, lots of nieces and nephews, some adoptive family, not a lot of friends) so we knew from the beginning that we didn't want anything traditional. Nobody who is contributing financially is contributing towards any specific thing. We're grateful for any contributions but not demanding anything. My fianc [28M] and I [25F] have lived together for almost our entire relationship. He's involved in planning. We're very detail oriented and we know what we want, so having four sets of parents with very different opinions is difficult, to say the least. 

But we have our venue booked! And a date! A few days short of 13 months out. We're excited to really get to planning! But we have zero other choices made, really. I know my bridesmaids. 

Where is everyone else at in planning?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay I am having a similar problem with bridesmaids. I asked all of my sisters and stepsisters (I have 5 total) to be bridesmaids, plus my two closest friends. My wedding is only going to have like 65 people, lol. 7+7 for a bridal party for a wedding that small is... Unwieldy. 

So I'm not asking anyone to step down or anything. They're all technically still bridesmaids and still a part of the day. But the sisters I'm not as close with will be sitting, not standing. this won't come as a shock to them. My standing crowd will be my bio sister, my youngest step, my oldest guy friend, and my best friend of 6 years. The other two steps will be sitting and my FSIL will be on FH's side as they're fairly close. Bingo. Extended party but only a few standing. They'll still wear coordinating dresses (we're going mismatched but cohesive) but not stand. Easy. 

My future MIL had lots to say about the size of my bridal party. This seemed like a good compromise and she hasn't said anything about it since then.  </TEXT>
