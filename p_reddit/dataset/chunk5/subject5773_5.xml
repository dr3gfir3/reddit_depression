	<TEXT> The ones I can think of that are active users (as in the ones who actually use them besides just doing an AMA)
* /u/zachinoz - Zach Braff
* /u/wil - Wil Wheaton
* /u/GovSchwarzenegger - Arnold Schwarzenegger, obviously
* /u/ColChrisHadfield - Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who did his AMA from the International Space Station
There was one more I remembered but I've now forgotten.
Edit: I remembered who it was but someone else said it. /u/here_comes_the_king - Snoop Dogg (sorry, Snoop Lion).
I never noticed this before. Check out Zach Braff's overview and look at the subreddits that he mods:
* /r/GeriatricPorn
* /r/CODCIRCLEJERK
* /r/Clownporn
* /r/handporn
* /r/ShemalePorn
* /r/MILFporn
* /r/grandmasgonewild
