	<TEXT> Was making a deck, then game bugged and couldn't do anything. Exited, came back and saw that the deck had 0 cards. Remade the deck. Game bugged again.
Now couldn't even get to the main menu. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would be cool though, to see a younger Cairne, in his prime. Too bad there was just no way to write him into the story there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> F2P, playing since the Jan or Feb last year, haven't paid a dime for any packs or adventures. Sure as hell am not going to start now. When Naxx was announced, i started to save and hoard gold for a month and could just buy the last wing a couple of days after its release on the 5th week. Have recently created quite a few good legendaries aswell, like Rag, Boom and Sylvanas and i have been lucky with some packs, got Grommash and Baron Geddon, so i've got a somewhat decent Control Warrior setup + the much cheaper and very much hated Mechmage and Scumhunter, and whatever else i have put together.

Bring it on, Blizzard! I WILL STILL HAVE MY FREE FUN!

...wouldn't hurt to make the minimum quest rewards like 50+ though... </TEXT>
