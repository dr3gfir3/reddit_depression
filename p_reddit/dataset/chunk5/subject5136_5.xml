I was simply answering and the pollution part.  I think there is just as much talk of other pollutants as there is about CO2 emissions.  The big difference is that we admit these others are a problem, and have seen measurable efforts to reduce them.

It's explicit goal is to monetize the externalities, making alternatives much more affordable, relatively.  You should look up what the revenue neutral part means, government benefits would be small to non-existe.  I'm not sure what segment of the population is getting fucked over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, was on mobile.  

My point is that there's this impression that the overwhelming amount of shale oil needs 90+ to make money.  This simply isn't true. In late 2014, service companies had every rig on a 3 month wait list, were paying high school dropouts 200k (not necessarily a bad thing - great for local economies) and upper execs ungodly bonuses, while turning 20% profit margins. 

This is a large reason why production costs were so high.  Those costs have dropped substantially as service providers are forced to actually compete and become lean, and costs will continue to drop as technology is forced to improve.  And the pop above 62 for prompt WTI allowed a lot of producers to hedge cal 16, 17 - that bump was a pretty substantial game changer.

Traditional global wells are the ones cutting spending the most and curtailing projects, and on projects that have 2-3 year lead times.  Shale oil can have 6 month lead time from initial infrastructure, 3 months for sites with infrastructure, and almost instant production for wells in the frac-log, although reports waver on how much it has decreased. </TEXT>

Previous prodx was hedged at 90, with costs at 80+. Some marginal wells higher than that, and those owners should go under.

New wells hedged above 62, Q2 costs well below 60.

The trajectory of oil production had rigs not dropped was astronomical.

Any producer who knew anything the past few weeks hedged when prompt was 62. Their current costs, with ~1/2 the US rigs looking for a home, is below 60 for good locations, same costs Nov were 80+. </TEXT>

Comparing boom-time service costs, when every rig in the US was backlogged, to bust-time costs is not a good comparison.

Many wells are now profitable w/ oil at 60, when they were previously profitable at 90.  While many locations still aren't doing great, thinking that they are selling 60 and paying 80+/bbl total service costs is off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really cool album, thanks for this. Considering growing some very soon, and hope you can help with a few questions.

Where did you get the original spawn, and did you make those jars of spawn you used yourself? 

Once you harvest the fruits, will it fruit again?

Can you use the spores to create a new colony?

	<TEXT>  What about fertilizer? What about farm fuels? What about pesticide production? What about emissions from water pumping energy? What about transportation of the product? What about transportation of the seed to the fields?

 And you don't care about biodiversity? About monoculture? About water and so many other factors? But, that's not even the point. The point is that you can't just harvest old growth forests and say "Well they had stopped sequestering carbon, so it doesn't count."

I brought this up because we had this exact argument a few weeks back.  You were arguing for industrialized food systems, and I brought the argument of corn and soy to CAFOs - the real monoculture - vs. pasture raised and finished, a biodiverse ecosystem.  It's funny that you mention monoculture.

I'm certainly not arguing for tearing down old growth forests to ship across the ocean to burn for electricity, just showing some perspective for food systems. </TEXT>

There was some discussion in another thread last week about China's use of robots, WSJ reported on it over the weekend.

Some interesting points:

"China already ranks as the worlds largest market for robotic machines. Sales last year grew 54% from a year earlier, and the boom shows every sign of increasing. China is projected to have more installed industrial robots than any other country by next year, according to the International Federation of Robotics."

"One reason China will continue booming is because it has relatively low robot density, the trade group says. China has about 30 robots for every 10,000 factory workers. In Germany, the density is 10 times that amount."

"Meanwhile, there is little evidence so far that robots are having a big impact on employment. Average urban wages in China rose more than 10% in 2014, even as the country remains on target to create at least 10 million new jobs this year." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely don't think that they should force:

a black baker to make a confederate flag cake or require a Jewish baker to make a nazi flag cake

But that's not what happened with the Christian bakers.  They wouldn't make any cake for a gay couple, but they would make the exact cake for a straight couple. It was the people vs. the content, which I know it doesn't matter to you - they should be allowed to choose how they like, and I lean towards agreeing with that sentiment.

BUT your comment, and many I've heard in this sub, came off as "these poor Christian bakers, being enslaved by gay rights dictators. What did they ever do?" while *actively lobbying* for preventing someone else's rights to marriage. i.e.

All I am saying is that one group actively lobbying for discrimination is not the same as one group actively lobbying for equal rights. </TEXT>

This example is nowhere close to slavery in the diction that most people agree upon - they are able to stop baking whenever they want.  They can go work in another line of work.  They can even start a club and do the exact same thing they are doing.  So if slavery = inconvenience, your reasoning has some issues.

	<TEXT> Let me preface by saying I understand the scientific literature that says that direct human consumption of transgenic crops has been proven safe.

But it baffles me how many of these blind *raw raw science* people think that commecialized transgenics are creating super cool, futuristic crops, when the overwhelming, vast majority of approved - and likely near future - transgenics, by any number, are glyphosate and other herbicide resistant, and bt corn and soy to animal feed and ethanol.  These crops are hugely subsidized with a price floor that sends the *exact opposite* signal that a market would.

A huge amount of the corn to animal feed goes to CAFOs, creating horribly sick cows pumped full of antibiotics.   There's [more and more evidence](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/document-1355766984329/) that grass fed beef has advantages for the environment over CAFO fattening beyond the health of the animal. 

I don't think GMOs should be labeled, but I do believe that GMOs are a cornerstone in a horribly inefficient industrialized food system held up by terrible government policies.

I'd prefer to have concrete solutions past step 1 than looking at some silly sub.  

Am I wrong to have the impression that essentially all public funding for mental health institutions would be cut.  Call me skeptical, but I believe there would be way less private money replacing that public money, and people with serious mental health problems mentioned above typically aren't able to pay for those services.  

I'm fairly certain that no matter the conclusions from step 1, with significantly less funds to implement any potential solutions discovered, said solutions would fail. </TEXT>

As for grass, it's also a given that it's more biodiverse, as this is often the intent of the ranchers.  [Here's a study that includes the carbon sequestered for the footprint, and addresses a number of the monoculture concerns.](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/document-1355766984329/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Industrial system:

Ungodly subsidized, giant, sterile monoculture corn and soy corn fields feed into giant, disease ridden CAFO facility which has to pump the animals full of antibiotics because they are sick from the living conditions and food they aren't meant to eat.

Here we have 100% of the used land as the complete opposite of biodiverse.

Alternative system:

Biodiverse, healthy grasslands raising other animals with synergies - mainly broiler and laying chickens.  

Here, assuming the assertions I made are completely wrong, we use marginally more land for production - but that land we are using is significantly more biodiverse than the industrial system. But if the alternative systems are further developed possibly less.   This article isn't helping the case for further development.

I also didn't see the carbon previously sequestered in the soil when corn fields are tilled being released back into the atmosphere, nor carbon sequestered from healthy grassland, of which Iowa has released huge amounts of.  And in the study the "waste" products - for field systems they are an valuable input and go back into the fields.  For large scale CAFOs they become a toxic waste that goes into tailing ponds. </TEXT>
