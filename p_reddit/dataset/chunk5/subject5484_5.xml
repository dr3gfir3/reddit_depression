	<TEXT> Yes, I'm talking about speech.  Go to r/atheism and have a look, or go to Youtube and search for "atheist pwns".

Let's say I'm a Jainist.  I believe all life is holy because God is the cosmos.  I try to escort mosqitoes out of my house and eat a strict vegan diet.  I am absolutely a believer and not an atheist.  I also abide in a policy of non-interference and believe in finding my own inner peace.

What use do I have for a bunch of atheists rolling in a-hootin and a-shoutin about the existence of God?

Why not just do what I, as an atheist, wanted all along?  Just fuck off and let me do my thing.

And, dammit, I'm not saying there's an equivalency.  There's simply what you do with yourself when you escape previous oppression.  Do you rise and value your newly found status, or do you slump back down into ugliness?

Secularism is on the rise.  Atheists are doing no one a favor by mistaking the rise of secularism for the rise of atheism.

Rather, a loud and obnoxious segment are going on the offensive.  I think they think they are helping with "the cause".  Atheists didn't advance secularism by getting in people's faces.  Secularism advanced without any atheists speaking out.  It did so quietly without affiliation, without identifying as anti-god.  If god doesn't exist, then it ends at non-existence, not going after those who believe to make them believe something else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my wee town where I grew up, the clergy went after the first Pizza Hut for being open on Sunday.

The owner refused to bow down, and now pretty much everything is open on Sunday.  Why?  Mostly because a bunch of less pious pragmatic-minded people moved into the area.  Based on where I live (very very red), these outsiders weren't a bunch of atheists.  They were Christians who were more interested in shopping 7 days a week and didn't give two flops about some local religious crap about businesses being closed on Sundays.

This is what happened.  Now, let's propose that, instead, a bunch of card-carrying atheists convened on the area and demanded that Pizza Hut be open on Sunday because god doesn't exist.

My guess is that things would be much closer to what the old status quo was than the progress that occurred without such agitation.

Saying that much of US policy is influenced by religion is hard for me to agree or disagree with.  I see it from a 40-year perspective and can definitely say that it is less so than it used to be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, but human rights violations need not be supported by arguments that god does not exist.

Been to China? I lived there.  They're 90%+ atheist because the communists banned religion.  They're a very real illustration of how an "areligious" society doesn't behave any more ethically than ones with religion.

To say that obnoxious atheists are the equivalent of all misdeeds committed in the name of religion would be false equivalency.  

That's not what I'm trying to suggest.

If you look at the history of Christianity, it was very much in keeping with "The meek shall inherit the earth".  They were very thoroughly persecuted before they finally achieved primacy.  And after all that persecution?  The bullied became the bullies.  In a grand, multi-millennium fashion on a scale the world had never seen.

So, when atheism (really secularism more than atheism) gains traction, it disturbs me at a fundamental level when I see atheists take their newly-found stature on the offensive and start bullying the religious.  Neither Christianity nor Atheism bullied their way out of persecution.  Atheists attacking the religious is being vengeful.  Christians failed to resist this temptation, and I don't need religion to understand that vengefulness is wrong.  It goes right back to the human rights abuses you begin with.

So, no, atheists haven't done all of those bad things, but is bullying an indication of how atheism/secularism results in a better world?

	<TEXT> I've lived in some very different parts of the world, so I take your point.

I'm largely speaking about the status of atheism in countries like the US and UK.

At the same time, rather than militant atheism, the shift in the countries I speak of is and has been based on separation of church and state.

Bangladesh comes to mind as a country where atheists have been killed for their beliefs.  I don't think anything I'm saying applies to a scenario like that, but I still believe that a country can't jump from theocracy to atheism.  If the US or the UK had attempted that, we'd still be at square one.  While I had no intention of writing about this in my first post, I'd actually say that this separation between religion and state needs to first occur to make further progress.  Freedom of religion paves the way to the legitimacy of secularism.

I grew up somewhere where I was told by my classmates that I was bad because I said I didn't go to church.  I was 8, but it still remains as a random conversation that became more important as I grew up.  I could try to ride back into my village and try to assail those who done me wrong, but the better solution was to just get out.

I hope that getting out is an option for you as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That might be true, but Dawkins is no teenager and his books sold like gangbusters.

And you can have a field day teeing off on people like the Kansas Board of Education and Kent Hovind.

But pushing only encourages a counter-push, and it's polarizing.

Secularism's achievements lie largely in passive resistance.

So yeah, being young lends itself to militancy, but mental age is another factor and I wouldn't be so harsh on a specific age set when people much older do not always gain the nuance one might expect from being older. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's interesting, but I don't hesitate to defend against aggressive religious types.

More importantly, a subreddit is still some kind of attempt to collectivize.

I grew up with my beliefs (or lack thereof) in a town of 3000 with 22 churches.  It was nice to talk to others with similar life views and was the target of believers, but I never needed and still do not need to be a part of a club.

It was nice to escape that little hamlet and even better to see the world become more secular, but the Dawkins-inspired rise of militant atheism was not something I anticipated or welcomed.

On the other hand, apatheism seems to be an inadvertent endorsement of labeling and "identitarianism".  There are centuries of thinkers and authors who were atheists without being apatheist.  It simply doesn't seem useful to me.

Disclaimer: I've learned about all of this in the past hour, so maybe I'll rethink it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, Mark Cuban,

1) Remember back during the campaign when candidate Trump was entitled to intelligence briefings but didn't want them?  That's kinda fishy.  Maybe guilty is a better word.

2)  Remember him winning and still not wanting anything to do with the intelligence briefings?  That's also kinda guilty.

3)  Then he got a standing ovation.  Then there was Flynn.  Then Sessions.  Then Manafort. Then Jared.  Then even Nunes has Russian links through a vineyard. As opposed to him not vetting, it looks almost like you had to have Russian links to be a part of his transition team

4)  I have no idea what brilliant conspiracy Cuban is referring to when he says Trump's too dim to have led it.

The brilliant conspiracy boils down to "Hey Russians, can y'all help us with this election?  You can?  OK, sweet!"

There is nothing brilliant at all about this hot mess.  It's more like you have to wonder what these turnips were thinking when they pulled all of this egregious shit and thought that it would never come to light.

5) Now Marky, if this is your idea of demonstrating your shrewd powers of analysis before you attempt a 2020 run, let's just say it isn't too brilliant on your part to guess at length and exonerate the president BEFORE the evidence from all the investigations is revealed.  It isn't a prudent move at this juncture, and the fact that you couldn't be bothered to write an article but instead, of all things, had to tweet your 12-part theory does not bode well for you, either. </TEXT>

This country is no longer divided.  

There a lot of different views and agendas, but the vast majority are united against Trump.

I reject any and all suggestions that we are split down the middle.  We may have been at one point, and we may be again in the future.  

BUT this president does not represent the majority of American people, nor does he come close to representing half.  In fact, he stands for things that the majority of Americans oppose.  Even if he won the electoral college, he no longer has the support he did.

I'm not going to label those who still support this man deplorable, but I will call them what they are:  a minority.

This vocal minority may want what the president wants, but the vast majority does not.  

America is united against Trump.

Don't let him or his followers convince you otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for specifics.

Tortoises v Solar station- I'd be inclined to hear what ecologists have to say.  Our country has a long history of screwing the environment for profit.  Granted I've heard of NIMBYs not wanting wind farms in places because they're an eyesore as opposed to killing birds, so yeah, there may be tweaking to be done here, but that shouldn't mean tossing the EPA.  Sniff Test:  What would other G20 countries do in this case?  I'd guess most would protect the tortoises.

ADA- Most of the ADA deals with commercial property/real estate.  It's about building facilities to a standard that makes them accessible.  A small business owner who can't afford to meet these standards needs to rent a facility if they can't afford to keep theirs up to code. AFAIK, you're talking about ramps and doors that let wheelchair-bound people negotiate a property.  If there are more excessive requirements, these might need to be rethought.  Sniff Test:  What would other G20 countries do?  My guess is that they have code up to US standards if not stricter.

Patents-  It's interesting because Mark Cuban says that patents are wreaking havoc on the software/app industry, with profiteers miring down new ideas by filing claims they know they don't truly have but are hoping to be bought out so that publishers can move forward.  It's also interesting that on Shark Tank, the first question sharks want an answer to is whether people have secured patent rights to their innovations because, otherwise, they have nothing and will be knocked off by competitors.  At the same time, I am aware of Disney trying to extend copyright from 70 years to however long they can get it extended.  Personally, I'm pretty sure all of the newcomers and small businesses want the protection that patent and copyright afford.  I could see how there might be rules set that are industry-specific, but patents serve a valuable purpose.  Sniff Test:  Any G20 countries that have or plan to ditch patent/copyright?  Not at all.  So, not here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NP.  Here's a bit more:

Moran also claims that on the evening prior to his death, Poe repeatedly called out the name of Reynolds. Substantial efforts have been made to identify who Reynolds may have been, with unimpressive results. At least one scholar felt that Poe may have instead been calling the name of Herring (Poes uncle was Henry Herring) (W. T. Bandy, Dr. Moran and the Poe-Reynolds Myth, Myths and Realities: The Mysterious Mr. Poe, Baltimore: E. A. Poe Society, 1987, pp. 26-36).

Poes clothing had been changed. In place of his own suit of black wool was one of cheap gabardine, with a palm leaf hat. Moran describes his clothing as a stained, faded, old bombazine coat, pantaloons of a similar character, a pair of worn-out shoes run down at the heels, and an old straw hat (Moran, Defense of Poe, p. 59.) J. E. Snodgrass offers a more detailed description: a rusty, almost brimless, tattered and ribbonless palmleaf hat. His clothing consisted of a sack-coat of thin and sleazy black alpaca, ripped more or less at several of its seams, and faded and soiled, and pants of a steel-mixed pattern of caseinate, half-worn and badly-fitting, if they could be said to fit at all. He wore neither vest nor neck-cloth, while the bosom of his shirt was both crumpled and badly soiled. On his feet were boots of coarse material, and giving no sign of having been blackened for a long time, if at all (Snodgrass, The Facts of Poes Death and Burial, p. 284). Moran also quotes Capt. George W. Rollins, supposedly the conductor of the train, as noting two men who appeared to be following Poe (Moran, Defense of Poe, pp. 60-61.)

	<TEXT> So, two fathers of movements and two of the most important Post-Impressionists, one of which is considered among the most influential painters in western civilization.  I'm speechless.

That's like saying Robert Johnson, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane are a bunch of amateurs compared to Skrillex.

I think artistically you are completely missing the whole concept of genre.  There's a reason you can't compare the Rolling Stones to Mozart.  I'm pretty sure there are simply a whole pile of genres you're unfamiliar with and, because you prefer whatever current genres you prefer (you make very little effort to support your side of this argument), yours are way better and more important simply because you like them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My study abroad year of university, everybody at my school paired up to go Eurail around before the semester started.

I chose to do the same with "Steve".

Long story short, traveling with someone is second only to living with someone in terms of potential conflict and stress.

I hated it.  For Christmas break, I went out by myself and loved the experience.  I was so much more focused on taking it all in as opposed to inane yacking, and there was no stress at all about where we'd go, when, and how.

The only case where I travel with others is if we're going to go hang out on a beach or some such that doesn't actually involve a lot of real traveling.

If I'm hitting the road, I'm going it alone and very happy that I'm solo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously, communism has failed on a large scale due to corruption everywhere it's been attempted.  

Markets started out free until, inevitably, people try to cheat and abuse them.  The whole free market premise that "pure competition" will result in ethical business if we just remove all the rules is a horrible idea that will result in all new levels of cutthroat business and collusion than anything resembling a more ethical market.

I'll just add that, from a purely philosophical viewpoint, neither is truly a bad idea in its own right.  There's a spirit behind each that I can appreciate.  However, in practice, they are both highly problematic.  Note what both extremes have in common.  They are both tragically vulnerable to corruption.

Social democracy, which is what everyone from the USA to Sweden has, has proven the most successful and enduring.  Finding what is precisely the best "mixture" is an ongoing project, and there probably isn't one single best combination that would fit all countries and all situations.  And obviously, social democracy is not free itself from corruption.  On the other hand, it has proven to hold corruption in check far better than the other two extremes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2/3 of famous painters' work looks amateurish?  I have no idea what art you're looking at.

Music becoming overproduced is a cyclical event.  It last happened in the 80s.  After a while, there will be a new move back to raw.  See Nirvana.

In sports, the current players have the huge advantages of being able to learn from past players as well as new technology and materials.

Everything builds on everything.  So much is also derivative.  To prove your sports point, you'd have to get Wilt the Stilt, Jordan, Kareem, Kobe, LeBron, and Steph all playing each other at the height of their careers at the same time to establish who was truly the best.

If you're going to look at someone like Bolt, you're gonna have to resurrect the best sprinters of all time, give them the money to train full time, and give them all the bells and whistles that modern training offers from the lightest shoes possible to pulse monitors and dieticians.  Even then, Bolt and Phelps are both one-offs who will probably not be "demolished" by the next couple of generations of athletes.

And do keep that in mind.  You'll be OK twenty years from now when all of these current people are demolished and called amateurs by the next generation, right?  The babies being born right now are going to denounce all of that layered music and take buzzsaw guitar music to new heights.  I hope you're ready. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is slightly off-topic, but in the early days of the net there was this website with a list of pbem games.  I know TKO Boxing was on it, and I played a kind of fun space themed card game where every turn you could anonymously or publically bolster one opponent and screw another with asteroid collisions and whatnot.

Also on that list was a game I never tried but was said to be based on a rhetoric/oratory game from Ancient Greece.  It started with 15 players, and each round every player would submit their "oration", which could be about anything.  Then, after reading/hearing all of them, everybody voted one person out.  This continued until only one player was left.  I believe the name of the game was Plonk.

Anybody know what on earth I'm talking about? </TEXT>

You really want smaller government?  He's giving you that by appointing people who hate certain federal agencies to run those very agencies.

This is the moment of truth.  Is it really a good idea to neuter the EPA, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the Department of Labor, and the State Department?

That's shrinking alright, but now that it's happening how good of an idea is this?

	<TEXT> Hmmm, so I'm not supposed to mention things made by inventors and scientists to compare with the internet, which was made by inventors and scientists?

OK, I'll have a go at it even though your argument is completely illogical.

You could simply say that internet, a technological innovation, is apples and oranges when trying to compare it to the founding of a state.

Then again, founding of states is historically a move that promotes stability when done right.  Without a stable state, innovations like the internet are far less likely to develop.  Perhaps the best example is when the collapse of the Roman Empire plunged western civilization into the Dark Ages, a thousand years of very little development where people just struggled to get by.  Things got a bit better in the Medieval era, but really took off with the development of the Italian city-states where the Renaissance took hold.  These states highly valued both scholarly endeavours and the arts, funding them in unprecedented fashion.

Whatever conditions may be afflicting America at the moment, the founding of the USA represented a new direction in pluralist governance that ended the age of monarchies.  And who funded the people who would create the internet? The US government birthed the ARPANET via a technical research program and the Department of Defense.

And, really, the internet is a one-off kind of invention that changes everything.  Your original claim is that people today are "consistently" doing better things than their predecessors.  I doubt they're doing much of anything that isn't highly derivative and extremely dependent upon those who came before us.

What we accomplish now, we only do so because we are standing on the shoulders of giants.  </TEXT>
