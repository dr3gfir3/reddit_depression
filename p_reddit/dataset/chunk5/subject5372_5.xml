	<TEXT> For this visualization I categorized people 15 to 34 years old are as Millennials. I found that almost 27% of people in the US fall into this age group. While Most states did not significantly differ from this I found that their were a lot of variation in the counties, especially smaller counties. This visualization lets you explore that with the ability to filter by gender and highlight by geography.

The data used in this visualization is compiled by the US Census Bureau. I used Table PEPAGESEX from American FactFinder to determine population counts by age. Once I had the data and the age groups I was going to use, I cleaned the data with Excel and used Tableau to create the visualization.

	<TEXT> The idea for this post came from one I completed a few months ago about what the unemployment rate has been in each county in the US for the last 25 years. I used this data and the latest 2015 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to make this visualization. The data was cleaned in Excel and then Tableau was used to create the timeline. The data published by BLS is the average unemployment rate for the year. I then strung them together to make the timeline.

In addition to using Tableau and Excel, the website Codepen is used to host custom CSS and JS coding. The idea to do this came from Ben Sullins website. In a recent blog post, he explains how to use this coding and Tableau to create 50 state maps. I used this same idea to create timelines for each states unemeployment rate. Be sure to check out his site for more great ideas on using Tableau, CSS, and JS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that you are right that if you use too many filters it can get too small to make sense. I just think it is better to provide users with the entire interface and let them decide what makes sense and what is drilling in too far.

I can't think of a way to allow to drill in for each of the variables without presenting them all. I am also looking into ways to improve this for future visualizations such as including margin of error or using the 5 year ACS dataset.

	<TEXT> The data used in this visualization is compiled by the US Census Bureau which produces the American Community Survey. I used the 2015 one year estimates from table B12001 from American Fact Finder. I used Excel to clean the data and Tableau to create the visualization.

For this question, respondents have 5 responses that they can choose from. Only respondents that are 15 years or older have there responses tallied in this total. Since the question is set up this way it is worth pointing out that this likely is only individuals that current relationship status is divorced. If someone was divorced, but remarried, they would likely choose to say that they were married. A screenshot of the question has been included in the post </TEXT>
