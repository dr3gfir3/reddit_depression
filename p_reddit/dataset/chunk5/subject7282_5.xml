	<TEXT> I was in a unisex bathroom at a hole in the wall pizza shop in NYC and the knob was one of those weird "push in the knob and rotate" to lock things. I did what I thought was lock it when suddenly an older lady opened the door, yelled and hit me with her purse in surprise. Thankfully I was facing away from the door so I didn't expose anything! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to get an oil change recently and the guy pointed to the [pure drive](http://www.greeleygazette.com/press/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/PureDrive.jpg) logo on the back of the car saying that logo means I need the "super premium platinum gold high milage whatthefuckever synthetic oil". 

I declined and went for the basic, not entirely sure what the logo actually means, got home and discovered it basically just falls below certain CO2 emissions by Nissan.

Fuck that guy. </TEXT>
