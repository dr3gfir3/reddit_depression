	<TEXT> This will never happen and it's not because of the cable companies in most cases.

Content distributors mandate that if cable companies want to carry X channel, then you also need to carry I.e. Pay us, to carry these other 10 channels. This is the source of the bundle forced on the consumer.

Now that doesn't mean companies like comcast are innocent, they are after all a content distributor. However, take a content distributor like YES Network   (20th century Fox is majority owner) whose carriage agreements mandate other channels with low viewership must be sold as well, and you can see why Comcast dropped them in 2016.

	<TEXT> I was waiting for someone to say that I.e.  "we had so   many colonies"...which makes sense but certainly does nothing for the ol' America ego!

World War 1 we are taught a lot about actually (or a fair amount.). The Franco-Prussian empire, assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, secret alliances etc are covered.  They really focus on the post Lusitania war activities but we do learn about the run up.

WW2 is a totally different story.  While we are *very* educated about the rise of Nazi Germany, the US school system glosses over the Japanese side of the story.  

As I've gotten older, I've come to the conclusion this is intentional simply because then it fits the narrative of Pearl Harbor being an "out of the blue" attack.  The overwhelming majority of Americans have no knowledge of The Nanking Massacre or other Japanese aggression that ultimately led to our Oil and Scrap Metal Embargoes of Japan or that we closed off the Panama Canal to them, greatly impacting their economy.

Japan and US were very much at odds leading up to Pearl Harbor but to say the surprise attack was truly a "surprise" feels a little disingenuous. However, to teach that in school would mean America has to tacitly accept responsibility for the fact that Japan's declaration of war was motivated by our own actions (even though our actions were well intended and meant to stop them from committing acts of further aggression) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That doesn't surprise me.

America was all about "no kings! Throw off the yolk of the king!" and King John being forced to sign the Magna Carta by men that broke into his home, plays nicely into the American narrative about the "common" man beating the monarchy.

England, as far as I am aware, still takes pride in their monarchy (and I don't think the Monarchy would look to kindly on that time the king was forced to do something!)

(If any of my understanding of Magna Carta, and how it came to be signed is wrong, then blame American textbooks for their description of events) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on what they do.

There are a lot of people with jobs in this industry that have zero exposure to the markets, regulators, etc.  In that case you are 100% right.

There are also people that ascribe to different schools of economic thought i.e. what actions best produce the best macroeconomic/microeconomic results.  In this case you're not wrong, but it's more in line with your comment about rolling the dice.  The global economy is far too complex to say "taking A action will cause B result every time" (barring insane scenarios like replacing your fiat currency with an economy based on bartering Reddit Karma...that will always cause a market crash lol)

While that leads to disagreement, at least it's informed disagreement.

	<TEXT> When you think about spying in America you have to start with Nathan Hale, a person that in all likelihood was well known even 100 years afters his death.

Hale holds the dubious distinction of being the first US spy executed. Within the article below is a list of "official rules for spying" compiled by a museum about the Cold War.

If we apply those rules retroactively to the Civil War, we can see that the likelihood of effective spycraft is reduced because of rule 2: Don't Attract Attention, Blend In. (First link below)

While we were one country, Northerners and Southerners were disparate enough groups of people that blending would have proved challenging, despite sharing a similar language (see second link below).

Lastly, just to state the obvious, even if spies were widely used, their names might never be known nor what they did. (Kind of defeats the purpose of being a spy and puts the spy's life in future jeopardy)

	<TEXT> B student in high school

C- student in college  (was on academic probation after 1st semester)

Never applied myself at all and was actually embarrassed by a professor in front of entire department and all families at my college graduation.

Took a shit job out of college (payroll at a law firm) and, after a year of that pursued a career in banking and investments.

Was still a fuck up and almost got fired twice.

When I finally got married I decided to apply myself and now I'm the management level below the C suite at a wealth management firm.

TL;DR:  If the only reason you're a C student is because you're lazy like I was, then you're just standing in your own way. You need to find something to actually motivate you to care or things are never going to change. </TEXT>

While I'm certainly not a neurologist, I'm guessing that uneasy feeling occurs because even though you have the heart rate and blood pressure drop, you never actually lose consciousness (but your consciousness is effected)

I think you might be perceiving a general lack of warmth toward everyone as a directed attitude toward women (because you expect there to be a softer touch when interacting with women).

Also, when did Russia become "renown" for misogyny?  You can say a lot of negative (and true) things about most countries, but at least provide an objective reference.

Less corruption = less money for FIFA board members et. al.

	<TEXT> Perhaps encyclopedia brittanica is more to your liking (see below)

Also, just because "Badass of the week" cites Timur, doesn't invalidate the actual historical conqueror.   

And that wasn't even remotely a bait and switch. If it turned out Timur was actually a vegan painter that lived in Temecula, CA and drove a Tesla, then that would be a bait and switch.  

I laid out a number of known historical facts

I intentionally omitted further facts to ensure my point was not misunderstood

I included two bits of trivia and cited them as things **not considered genuine** (the very definition of Apocryphal). 

History is littered with examples of this: 

the Gordian knot and Alexander of Macedon

The cherry tree and George Washington

King tut and his tomb

None of these bits of apocrypha make history any less Interesting or true.  They are *minor* facets of a much larger story BUT are nonetheless interesting. Which in turn makes some (like me) research why they came to exist at all. Perhaps the OPs friends will feel the same.

	<TEXT> I'm calling them Apocryphal only because I can't easily cite a source, but I learned them in my own college history classes.

Rather than represent those stories as fact, I wanted the OP to know I couldn't vouch for their veracity. 

And, just to state the obvious, I don't honestly believe there was a curse on Timur's tomb that led to World War II; however, that doesn't mean the OP's friends won't find this piece of information interesting (which was his original goal, to make it interesting.)

Truth be told, I actually **omitted** a fair amount of historically accurate info about Timur because I didn't want the OPs post to turn into a flame war about modern terrorism and religious extremism. I just wanted to give a response that might drive OP's friends to dig a little deeper.

	<TEXT> So I don't see any posts that actually answer OPs question: why suspend a kid from school.

Answer:

There was once a time when kids were actually left back a grade or expelled.

Suspensions were events that either preceded those events or, ultimately, led to them. 

Nowadays that rarely happens and kids are essentially passed to a new grade/school to be "some other teacher's problem"

Hence, while today an out of school suspension amounts to giving a kid vacation days, the original intended purpose was a precursor to a much more severe punishment intended to ensure the child behaved. </TEXT>

If you stick to the censorship interpretation, and she's knows the below, then you might get a poor grade

If you give the "official" interpretation, and she doesn't know it, then you might get a poor grade

Does it need to be controversial philosophy? If you want to be a suck-up you could always read "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance".  It's Eastern Philosophy told through a novel and most philosophy professors I had loved it.

Edit: Also, if you have any actual interest in egoism, start with Aristotle and work your way forward in time. 

Thinking you understand egoism, because you read Ayn Rand, is like thinking you know Star Wars because you saw Episode II.

1) Lived 100 years after Ghenghis Khan and subjugated 3/4 of his kingdom

2) estimated to have killed 5% of the *global* population with armies

3) Known for building towers/pyramids using the bodies/skulls of conquered enemies

4) Made no exception for women or children

5) Apocryphal story exists that if his tomb was disturbed it would bring about the end times.  Hitler visited 2 days after his tomb was disturbed. When Timur's remains were returned, the Russians beat back the Germans in Stalingrad very shortly after (again, apocryphal)

6) Apocryphal story exists about marching prisoners into a chasm until their corpses were piled high enough for his army to cross (again, *very* Apocryphal)

I'd link to Wikipedia but not always reputable.  That said, Timur definitely has a *very long* wiki entry. </TEXT>

Always made me think the girls who wore them looked like Andre the Giant....probably not what they were going for! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm missing the part where you refute my point about the United States being successfully invaded.

Capture/attack of merchant vessels does not equal continental subjugation and loss of national identity/forced assimilation and loss of our language.

Barbary pirates in the 18th century were no more invading America than Somali pirates are today. Case in point, the attacks you cite occurred in the Mediterranean (not exactly an imminent threat to our sovereignty).

The difference between conquest and thievery is like the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing one.

	<TEXT> Not to shit on other states but many of the "pointless" states (as you put it) are sparsely populated compared to those on the coasts.

For example, the entire state of Wyoming has half as many people as the 6 largest counties in New Jersey **individually, not combined" I.e. Simply by population, 6 of NJs counties are justifiably their own states (which plays into your other point.)

While I agree it seems ridiculous in some ways, I think the alternative (numerous small countries) would be worse and the contiguous US would face the kinds of challenges European nations face I.e. Hating all your neighbors and going to war with them when you finally feel justified or they attack an allied nation. </TEXT>
