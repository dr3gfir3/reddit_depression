Bannon is a total and complete whack job. His website publishes complete and total Looney Tunes nonsense every single day. The idea that I have to take that website seriously in order to be "nonpartisan" is completely and totally absurd.

As for proof that George W. Bush lied us into a war Are you kidding me?  Nobody's even pretending like that didn't happen. What the hell? everybody acknowledges he did that. Nobody really cares. </TEXT>

There is none. That ship has sailed. The military-industrial complex is basically completely taken over our foreign-policy and is nothing you and I can do about it as far as I know.

The so-called liberal media ignores  monstrous crimes by right-wingers and hypes up much less consequential crimes by liberals, all while right-wingers insist the media is against them

the wack job that runs Breitbart is our presidents number one advisor. the climate is going to hell and our entire government is infested with climate deniers. The world is going insane.

The course of action is to put George W. Bush and all of the people that lie us into a war on trial, convict them of their crimes against humanity, and lock them up in prison.

http://www.newsweek.com/2016/09/23/george-w-bush-white-house-lost-22-million-emails-497373.html

Like Clinton, **the Bush White House used a private email serverits was owned by the Republican National Committee.** And the Bush administration failed to store its emails, as required by law, and then refused to comply with a congressional subpoena seeking some of those emails. Its about as amazing a double standard as you can get, says Eric Boehlert,

Seriously, this is absolutely Looney Tunes.

In other words I've researched ACTUAL cases of people in high places participating in pedophile rings. What you people have done is create a complete fantasy out of whole cloth. your "Hillary and the Democrats are literally Satan on earth"mentality has warped your entire worldview.

you make it easier for people to completely dismiss out of hand legitimate accusations of pedophiles in high places by acting like complete and total wing nuts

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> it's no secret that the Republicans have long desired to slash or even cancel altogether any kind of tax credit for subsidies of solar wind and other clean energy sources.

Given the Republicans control all three branches of the government currently, it's safe to say clean energy subsidies are going to get reduced, big time.

How will companies like Tesla/spaceX/solar city survive this?

-----------------------------------------------------------


http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html

Los Angeles entrepreneur Elon Musk has built a multibillion-dollar fortune running companies that make electric cars, sell solar panels and launch rockets into space.

And he's built those companies with the help of billions in government subsidies.

Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, together have benefited from an estimated $4.9 billion in government support, according to data compiled by The Times. The figure underscores a common theme running through his emerging empire: a public-private financing model underpinning long-shot start-ups.

**"He definitely goes where there is government money," said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Jefferies Equity Research. "That's a great strategy, but the government will cut you off one day."**

The figure compiled by The Times comprises a variety of government incentives, including grants, tax breaks, factory construction, discounted loans and environmental credits that Tesla can sell. It also includes tax credits and rebates to buyers of solar panels and electric cars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Republicans have a nasty habit of crashing the economy very shortly after getting into power, and people either seem to forget this were never notice it in the first place.

Bush the first crashed the economy almost immediately after taking power. most forget that this was in part caused by a savings-and-loan scam enacted by none other than Neil Bush The president's own brother! that's right, a sitting president's own brother stole $1 billion, helped to crash the economy, and got away with it by paying a $50,000 fine.

http://rationalrevolution0.tripod.com/war/bush_family_and_the_s.htm

http://critcrim.org/potter.htm

the savings-and-loan scam only occurs because of sweeping DEREGULATION of the savings-and-loan industry under Ronald Reagan

Bill Clinton took office and the economy recovereed.

Bush the second took office and promptly crashed the economy in just six or seven years. This was in large part due to Guess what? DEREGULATION of the financial and banking industry under both Clinton and Bush the second.

Barack Obama and the Democrats took over 2008 and the economy recovered (sort of) 

So now we have more Republicans in power. I GUARANTEE you they will figure out how to crash this economy within four years. Mark my words is going to happen. Hell, most of the DEREGULATION they need is already in place!

Grab your nuts boys it's going to be a rough ride

Don't worry, Republicans will succeed in crashing the economy in record time. Bush the first crashed the economy immediately. Bush the second  crashed the economy in six or seven years. I'm sure Trump et al will crash it in his first term.

While Bernie was trying to educate people about his actual platform that contain actual positions on actual issues, the media was busy circle jerking wall-to-wall 24 seven coverage of the Donald Trump Circus.

I remember in the run-up to the Nevada primary they were interviewing voters, and many of them didn't know who Bernie Sanders was or what he stood for. And then the more they became educated about his platform, the more favorable they looked at him. but there was too little coverage and too little education and ultimately the Sanders campaign failed their.

But the media basically REFUSED to make this entire campaign about the issues! the media wanted to make this a reality TV style circus in order to gather short-term ratings. They HATE issues because they're boring and they require actual intelligent people which the talking heads on TV are not

So this is what we get.

 That's all fine and good. But these people rejected a "globalist" and instead embraced a GLOBALIST! Donald Trump is a living breathing embodiment of globalism. His clothing line was made in China, his hat  accessories were made in Mexico, the steel that built his hotels were forged in China, and he runs around the globe building golf courses for millionaires.

He is literally EVERYTHING these down-home rural voters you just described hate. He is literally the type of businessman that lives and breathes to screw these people over!

They've essentially divorced their abusive husband so they could marry their rapist

So I'm all glad that the average hillbilly Joe got their voice heard this election. It's just too bad that they embraced a party that is hell-bent on raping them in the ass over and over and over and over and over and over again. Because that's what Republicans do every time they get in power They economically screw over their base.

I know multiple people with schizophrenia and to be perfectly frank I think your sister is more likely suffering from some kind of extreme manic phase of bipolar disorder. But I am just an asshole on the Internet, she needs to be evaluated by Dr.

one thing I will say is this- People in this situation are IMMUNE to logic and reason. If you think you're going to sit down and explain to her that she's acting completely wacky and have her understand that and change, well Good luck to you.

The best thing you can do is to continue to tell your sister that you love and care for her and want what is best for her. Whatever you have to do to get her evaluated by a psychiatrist You do that. Whenever white lies or manipulations or this or that you have to do Do it.

Your sister is in danger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny you should ask!

I was just listening to this fascinating interview from a man who was in a car accident and basically crushed. Nearly torn in half. His insides were essentially Jell-O, and even his spine was crushed. He has made merely a complete recovery.

At one point he only had 6 inches or so of his small intestines, and they're supposed to be like 15 feet long. The miracle is that he literally GREW several feet of small intestines which is scientifically impossible to do

Fast-forward to 1:10 (one hour 10 minutes) for the story about his intestines, but the whole interview is absolutely fascinating. He left his body, had a NDE, went through the tunnel of light, talked to God the whole 9 yards

	<TEXT> I'm enraged. If I can't get the change I wanted the last 8 years, any change will do, for several reasons.

First of all you should not be getting down voted since your post is perfectly acceptable, although unpopular here

Secondly, what you said here is simply delusional. You will NOT get any kind of significant institutional change with Donald Trump as president. You will not.

Looking at his actual economic policies it's just more of the same right-wing Republican BS, cut taxes on the wealthy and screw the middle class that we've been seeing for decades from this party.

 He's not going to  "blow anything up" or cause the system to come crashing down or any of this other nonsensical ridiculous stuff you people believe is going to happen.

Trump will do what he always does, he will screw people over left and right and leave a wake of angry people in his path. Meanwhile with control of the House, Senate and presidency the Republicans will push through all of the truly awful horrible policies they've been salivating at the mouth to push through for years and years. and all of you Trump voters will get royally screwed bbecause this is what the Republicans ALWAYS do economically, they screw over their base.

I'm sorry but you people believe a lie. Which is exactly what this article is trying to explain to you and you just don't get it. </TEXT>

Theory

Arnold is not dead. Arnold faked his death, possibly using a robot body double, so that he could enter into the simulated world completely.

In fact, Arnold is Wyatt.

 Ford suspects something along these lines because he specifically asked Dolores when her last contact with Arnold was. Why would he ask her that if he knew there was no way there could be any more contact after Arnold's death?

Donald Trump: an erratic unhinged narcissist with absolutely no fleshed out actual policies who most likely is a serial sexual assaulter

do I like Hillary Clinton? No. But there is absolutely no way in hell I'm going for any of these other losers.

	<TEXT> the two movies share a nearly identical plot structure, and at least one nearly identical character

Observe

* a super evil big bad guy who wants to kill everybody/destroy the universe

beyond: check
guardians: check

* a weapon conveniently exists that will allow the super evil big bad guy to do exactly that

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* However! This weapon is missing one key element to make it fully functional. Super evil big bad guy must find this element so he can activate the weapon

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* a small group of good guys band together  to stop the super evil big bad guy from destroying the universe/killing everybody

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* An interspecies romance occurs involving Zoe Saldana

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* ample use of old-school pop rock music. Very unusual for a sci-fi movie.

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* Lots of high-powered action interspersed with lighthearted comedy

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* In the end the big evil bad guy finds the missing part of the weapon, puts the weapon together, and actually begins to deploy the weapon that will kill everybody/destroy the universe.

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* In the end of course the big evil bad guy and the lead actors/protagonist must face off mano a mano, alone, man-to-man. (in TV tropes this is called "alone with the psycho"). And of course the good guy wins, deactivates the weapon that's going to kill everybody/destroy the universe, and the big evil bad guy is destroyed.

I mean honestly movies these days or soooooooo formulaic, predictable,  and they all resemble each other.

Simon Pegg wrote this movie, and quite frankly he is a much better writer than this. I don't know what happened.

If you want to watch some absolutely great, original, fascinating sci-fi the check out HBO's Westworld. Sci-fi movies and superhero movies are basically now the same genre, and quite frankly it's kkind of boring.

	<TEXT> getting a little tired of hearing about how "Republican Party is dying" on this website all the time

MOST of the governors of this country are Republican 

MOST of those state legislators are Republican dominated

The house is Republican majority and will stay that way for The next 10 to 20 years? I don't know

The Senate is currently Republican majority  and may or may not stay that way right now. Projections for 2018 show it will likely swing Republican either way

And thanks to gerrymandering, and the fact that poor white Americans consistently vote against their own best interests, this is likely to stay this way for the foreseeable future

The Republican Party is NOT dying. </TEXT>

Eschenbach's source is Kyot, a mysterious French poet who originally got the story from Muslim contacts and later traveled throughout Europe researching the tale

Eschenbach's version of the story is definitely Muslim influenced, and that's what sets his version apart from all the others which are amalgamations of Christian and pagan/Celtic myths

the Grail and Camelot myths are the perfect synthesis of pagan/Celtic mythology and Christian mysticism. It really is equal parts both. To understand the Grail myth you really need to look and study Celtic myth, as well as Christian symbology

	<TEXT> fun facts

In the very earliest telling of the holy Grail myth, the Grail is in fact NOT a cup! according to Wolfram von Eschenbach's telling of the story,  the Grail was a stone (called lapis exillis) that fell from Heaven that was associated with the neutral Angels. These were Angels that sided with neither heaven nor hell in Lucifer's rebellion.

in one telling of the tale the stone is referred to as a black stone. Which is fascinating because at the center of Islam's holiest place, the kabaa, sits a black stone.

The first mention of the Grail being a cup was by Chrtien de Troyes. In this telling of the myth the questing knight Perceval finally finds the Magic Castle where witnesses the sacred procession of the Grail King, also referred to as the Fisher King.

During this procession there are several sacred objects presented, including the spear that dealt the deathblow to Jesus on the cross. One of the sacred object is referred to as "a Grail", which meant a saucer or a cup.  Note that it says "A" Grail, NOT "the" Grail. At that point in the myth it was just one of several sacred objects associated with the Grail King.

It was only later that it became "the" Grail, and as the myth progressed the Grail became more prominent and gained more and more redemptive/transformative powers.

There is also a whole other myth regarding the Spear, but that's another story for another time.

	<TEXT> I will preface this by saying yes OBVIOUSLY you consult with your doctor before taking any supplements

Having said that, there are supplements that have been shown to induce neurogenesis, which is the birth of new neurons is what you need to heal from a TBI

DHA/EPA-in omega-3 essential fatty acid that is absolutely CRITICAL for too many brain and nerve functions to mention. The best brand by far is Nordic naturals

B vitamins-get the methylated version, Jarrow brand is awesome.

Thiamine (vitamin B1)-on top of a multi-b you need extra vitamin B1. The best is allithiamine, which is a fat-soluble version of thiamine.

Lions mane mushroom - scientifically proven to stimulate new nerve growth. Google it.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23510212

DHEA - an over-the-counter readily available hormone that has been scientifically proven to stimulate neurogenesis. Best thing to do was ask your doctor for a blood test to see where your levels are now

those videos are pretty interesting actually. You should watch them.

This Democratic operative basically says "the Trump rally crowd is so full of unstable wing nuts that all we have to do to get some kind of violent conflagration to breakout is send somebody in with a Planned Parenthood T-shirt"

I mean they were definitely sending people to the rallies with the intention of causing trouble. It's just that the crowd is so full of crazy people it makes their job really easy.

Also that guy got fired the next day.

And fine They do good things! Great.

The point is that it is still a pay to play organization which allows foreign governments to pay bribes to the Secretary of State, soon to be president, of the United States of America. That's not okay. That is not a good thing.

The fact that they also happen to do good things is awesome, but it doesn't detract from my point.

	<TEXT> look, I totally completely hear what you're saying. And you make a lot of sense.

However!

The Clinton foundation is possibly the most corrupt political entity in America. I am not joking. And no I am not a Donald "unhinged lunatic racist rapist" Trump supporter.

the Clinton foundation has taken bribery to the next level. It's made bribery international. Is just not pay to play for American corporations, now it's pay to play for international corporations and foreign governments!

Think about that! If Saudi Arabia wants a favor from Sec./President Clinton, all they have to do was make a nice juicy "donation" (i.e. bribe!) To the Clinton foundation and Voil! Suddenly they get a nice juicy favor

I mean  Qatar "gifted" Bill Clinton $1 million for his birthday (recent WikiLeaks). You think they did that out of the goodness of their heart? They expect a favor in return for that!

I'm telling you we are electing an extraordinarily corrupt president and things are not going to go well for us.

As the law currently exist right now all of that is perfectly and completely legal. does it indicate  that corruption is very likely going on? Of course. But you don't prosecute on "indicators"

In order for it to be treason they would need a document saying "here is $1 million payment to Bill Clinton. In exchange I fully expect the US government to do  ____________ for me and/or my organization and/or my government etc."
