	<TEXT> It completely depends on the redemption. If you use points for an international DeltaOne flight, you may get several cents per skymile in value, but that assumes you would consider paying the cash price for it. Domestic in economy will usually run you between 1-2 cpp, maybe more if you're lucky.

If you have a Delta Amex card, they have an option where you can "Pay with Miles", wherein you pay the cash price for a ticket and can discount it by $50 for every 5k miles you redeem. This guarantees you a 1cpp value, so you would never go below that.

Also - you can only open 2 credit cards within 90 days, so with your SPG you could only get one other Delta card. As far as I know, the Delta Platinum offer is currently 35K skymiles + 5K MQM, so not a great offer (unless someone has a better referral offer, I have not been able to get anything higher). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I appreciate the work that went into this, I think it is disingenuous to assume that everyone who voted "No" or abstained from these votes receives no money from the telecom industry. A more fair representation would be to do a comparison between those who voted yes ($8.1 million) and those who didn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Supreme Court ordered a lower court to look at whether or not merchants should be allowed to openly state they have a "credit card surcharge" / "cash discount" for consumers who wish to pay with a cc. This doesn't change anything, but it's interesting to see where this will go.

Final vote results from the House clerk: http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll200.xml

edit: The House is now debating and will vote to pass the joint Senate resolution, with no amendments, to make this a bill.

**edit 2**: After the passage of H. Res. 230, the House has now **passed Senate Joint Resolution 34**, repealing the FCC privacy protections. The joint resolution now goes to President Trump for signing.

edit 3: Thank you to u/dayzstu for pointing out my error - this is H. Res 230, not HR230 (which is a different bill) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once the miles from the Delta Gold are in your Delta account, they are there permanently. Even if you close the card, you will keep those miles. I think the key long-term benefit of the Delta Gold is the free checked bag; if you're not getting enough use out of that to justify the fee, then it's worth closing since the CSR provides better returns. </TEXT>
