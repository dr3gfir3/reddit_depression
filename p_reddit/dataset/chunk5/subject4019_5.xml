Rhaegar and Rhaego are the babies of the family, twins. They're quite funny, and don't take much seriously. They do love jousting and meleeing though. And finally, my sister Nymella.

	<TEXT> Visenya could always feel his stars, and sometimes she'd even catch him in the act, which made her quite nervous. She didn't ask him to stop because, truth be told, she liked this one. She found herself starring at him more and more often now, though, she made sure she was very subtle about it, so doubtful he'd know. Though, she was sure that he caught a few, but definitely not all. 

During the trip to Rivierrun, she couldn't help but notice how much of a man he was becoming, and a good looking one at that. He didn't seem as rough as the other northmen, which she liked.

"Thank you Damian," she blushed. "You don't look too bad yourself."

	<TITLE> [Lore] Arrival at King's Landing </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-16 17:24:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "*We've finally arrived in King's Landing*," Selwyn thought.

"Little lord, we're here," said the fat carriage driver.


  King's Landing was absolutely beautiful, and high atop the hill was the Red Keep, as red and huge as ever. The city itself seemed as though it went on for miles, he looked as far as he could, and it didn't end. He wondered how big it could be. It was a loud city, quieter than the outskirts of Dorne, that's for sure, he wondered if he'd like it here. Then again, he would get to meet the two princesses, and maybe if he was lucky, the future king? Or maybe the greatest knight who ever lived, Ser Arthur Dayne?

 It seemed to take forever to get to the Red Keep and the way there was not as pleasant as Selwyn would have liked, so he closed his eyes until he got to the keep.

"Where do I go now?" Selwyn said, as he got out of the carriage.

"I would best go the Princess herself little lord," Martyn said, wiping the sweat from his forehead with a cloth.

"Martyn, would you accompany me to the gate?" Selwyn asked, a little nervous to be in King's Landing.

"Sure," Martyn smiled. 

  The Red Keep was much bigger than Selwyn ever dreamed of, he tried to lift his head up as far as possible, but even then, he didn't see the top of the keep.

"Get out of here," one of the guardsman said, pointing his sword at the slums.

"This is young Selwyn Santagar, grandson of Ser Aron Santagar," Martyn said, walking towards the guard.

"Do you have any business here?" the guard said, with a hint of anger in his voice.

"Yes, just ask Princess Arianne," Martyn said.

"Fine," he said, going into the Red Keep. "Keep an eye on these two." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They'd never been anywhere out of Dorne before, when they go to walk the streets of Oldtown, Rhaegar and Rhaego Sand were absolutely amazed, the fabled city of Oldtown was astonishingly beautiful. The smell of fresh bread and the sound of people talking filled the air. It was a beautiful day. 

"Isn't Oldtown wonderful?" Rhaegar said, moving the long pale blonde hair out of his eyes.

"Eh, it's ok. Can't believe I lost," Rheago said.

"Winning isn't everything brother," Rheagar said. "What a great city Oldtown is."

"Why don't you move here then?" Rheago said, agitated.

"I don't think I could, I'd miss all the Dornish girls," Rhaegar chuckled.

"You've never even been with a woman," Rheago said, trying to avoid the mud that was on the street.

"Maybe not, but nonetheless, they do look more beautiful than any other girls in the Seven Kingdoms," Rhaegar said chuckled.

They finally reached the Seven Shrines, it was as big and as magnificent just as Rhaegar had imagined.

"Why the hell are we here?" Rhaego said, looking at the shrines.

"To worship the gods of course, " Rhaegar said, looking at the shrines too.

"Fuck the gods, their cunts. I prayed and prayed to win this match and they didn't give me a win," Rhaego said, spitting at the shrines.

"You can't do that here! This isn't Spottswood where you can call the gods cunts all you like, you're at a shrine, show some respect," Rhaegar whispered, trying not to start a scene.

"Fine. Now if you excuse me, I'm going to find a whorehouse," Rhaego said, walking away.

"But you've no money," Rhaegar yelled.

Rhaego left without saying another word to him.

	<TEXT> The Santagars had arrived at Oldtown on time this time, all of them excited to see the events. The girls dressed up as beautiful as they could, in hopes of finding a suitor, and the gentlemen were just as handsome. It was a cloudless day when they arrived in the beautiful city of Oldtown.

"Might we see Quentyn?" Rhealla asked.

"Doubtful, he's at the Citadel" Ser Aron said, walking into the festival.

"Maybe we should visit," Oberyn insisted.

"If we've time, sure. I'd like to socialize first though brother," Ser Aron said walking towards the nearest crowd.

"Aron and his socializing, hasn't changed a bit," Oberyn chuckled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was dawn when Selwyn left Spottswood, the sky was a mix of red, orange, and white and the birds were chirping in the nearby trees.

"Please tell father said goodbye," Selwyn said, moving his dark hair from his eyes.

"I will," Ser Aron said. "Do you have all of your books?"

"Yes, grandfather, I have them all," Selwyn smiled.

"Umm, my lord, I believe we should be going now, we've got a long day ahead of us," the fat solider said.

"I believe he's right Selwyn," he said,trying to help the boy onto the horse.

"Now Selwyn, be a good for Princess Arianne all right? Same goes for little Princess Serenei," Ser Aron said. "Please send my regards to both."

"Yes, grandfather," Selwyn chuckled.

"Now you best be off!" Ser Aron said, a moment later the whip sounded, and there they went.

"Will we ever see Selwyn again? King's Landing is a dangerous place, Aron," Madelyn said, with tears in her eyes.

"We'll see Selwyn again, I'm sure of it. He's a smart boy, he knows how to protect himself. And who knows, maybe he'll practice fighting with the great Arthur Dayne" Ser Aron said, not sure himself if he'll ever see Selwyn again.  </TEXT>

House Martell has done a great deal for House Santagar, and we appreciate everything that you've done Princess, if we stepped over the line by asking this, I'd like to say, I meant to do no such thing at all.

"Because uncle, I love those old dusty books, and history, and healing people," Quentyn said, packing his things up. 

"Why not go hunting? You'll love it," Lorence refilled his goblet 

"I don't. Father took me when I was 15, it was terrible," Quentyn said, grabbing the wine on the table. "However, this, this is wonderful."

"Well, at least you like drinking," his uncle chuckled

"I am a man after all uncle," Quentyn chuckled. 

   Quentyn took a huge sip of wine and grabbed his bag.

"That's all you're taking?" Lorence said, shocked.

"It's all I need. Until then, uncle," the boy waved while walking out of the room.

 After the boy left, the room was dead silent except for the sound of spilling wine.

Drinking the spiced Dornish wine, Ser Lorence muttered "Gods I'm gonna miss that boy."

After, he drank in silence for a long while and feel asleep. </TEXT>

One day while Lorence was on a hunt, his son said that he should start a business selling furs. Since Lorence loved gold, he immediately thought that this was the thing he should be doing with his life, selling furs. "What else could I do that was better than hunting for gold, he thought." On that trip, Lorence acquired five furs, and is ready to sell them at a moments notice.
