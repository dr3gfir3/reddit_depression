	<TEXT> I wish so bad from the first time I saw RotS that we never saw Vader's suit. I had always imagined Vader's look in ANH to be his refined almost ceremonial equipment. I wanted to see a very gritty Anakin, burned, and more machine than man. I think Lucas just rushed the Vader look to sell more toys. Why the hell would he look so polished? Palpatines just had these perfectly fitting pieces of gear lying around to reconstruct a man?  
I wanted to see the monster that Anakin was truly to become. Decked in mech, deformed/burned and a black cloak, hunting down the final Jedi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently it was only poisonous decades ago when they only had incomplete samples and had to synthesize new adamantium to infuse Wolverine. I just read yesterday that Bullseye has some adamantium bones but he was infused with the purest form. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure if this has come up in Hulk history, or if there's a what-if sub. Just talking to friends over a few drinks about the difference between Banner and Hulk. I don't believe Hulk's skin could be punctured to accept adamantium, and Banner wouldn't last long into the procedure before becoming Hulk.   
Anyone have any insight or ideas on these silly thoughts? </TEXT>
