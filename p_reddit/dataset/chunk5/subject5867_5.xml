	<TEXT> The main character from Scalebound sure caught my eye. ;) 

Seriously though, Batman: Arkham Knight looks awesome, Rise of the Tomb Raider looks really promising, I'm intrigued by Inside, and I'm sure that Mirror's Edge 2 is going to be cool, as long as they don't screw it up. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOMT] Ritual Creepypasta that would get rid of fear </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-16 03:25:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I remember reading a pasta awhile ago, that was a description of how to do this ritual that would involve lighting a candle, writing your fears on a piece of paper and leaving the candle and paper alone in a dark room.

Then you would come back later and your fears would be gone. I think I read it on the Creepypasta Wiki, if that helps. If anyone remembers the title of this, I would very much appreciate it. </TEXT>
