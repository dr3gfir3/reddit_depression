	<TEXT> I agree with you 100%. 60e for an essentially MP game with not many maps. Better wait for full reviews. And what about campaign mode ? There is one right ? 


Right ?.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep same for me I was dueling a guy with my nobushi vs his raider. He won the first but I won the 2 other ones. He then switched to hos main warlord and we did a few more duels. All friendly and helpful. Very interesting and the best way to improve ourselves! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes you re right.

I changed it to another mouse button (number 4 on Logitech G502) and then I could finally counter guard breaks.. Middle button sucks since we don't have a finger on it all the time and it's rather hard to make a double click with it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same, I ll wait for the reviews and all, If the campaign mode is good then it might be worth the price. But if it's just MP then it should be 40e maximum. 

The gameplay is awesome but the maps are very tiny and there is only a few of them.I hope they have much more content for the full version. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well this worked the 2-3 first times as I wasn't expecting such poor behavior, I guess it is the same for many people. Also GB are hard to block for novices so his shit spamming probably worked the whole OB! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is our only strategy against shield classes. Nobushis are in paper any 2 handed weapon can 3shot us.

And you are free to block/parry the attacks yourself too !

I met a PK that was only doing GB and running away, rinse ,repeat. So annoying and boring but hell it feels good to destroy them afterward. When they play like that it means they aren't skilled so just train and outplay them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah for sure most people wouldn't want it, war in Europe is not even thinkable today, as it was created specially for that purpose. I really don't want to see a war in EU and I too love the open borders, I would even like to have a stronger EU, with countries working together to make the best for the Union and not trying to get the best interest for themselves.



It's more like a cold war right now IMO, obviously led by Russia that actually wish to expand back to USSR size. Expanding already their political dominance in the USA and they are the one supporting Le pen in France who is against the EU. I guess they wish to see the fall of the EU.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Drug trafficking is huge I'm France. Just weed business is worth about 1 billion per year so yeah imagine drug dealers in the guetto are like supermarkets. They have money to get weapons and hire lots of desesperate young folks that see more benefits in crime than in school. Probably because the first one allows them to get a better wage than the teacher.

We swim in our own shit. Fucking hypocrisy everywhere. You get rekt with wine and you are a patriot. You get stoned with weed you are a drug addict.

Gun ban ? Nah more like a gun control. My father owns several rifles and pistols he just needed a license with background and medical check. He needs to go training at the shooting range a certain amount of times a year to keep the license. And he cannot carry the weapon without having it locked in a box. </TEXT>
