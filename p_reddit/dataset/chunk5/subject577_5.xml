	<TEXT> One difficulty was a general lack of understanding of the Handbook itself

Maybe because it's secret and hidden?

With same-sex marriage now legal in the United States and some other nations, the Church felt the need specifically to address such marriages in the Handbook to draw a firm line and encourage consistency among local leaders.

They didn't feel the need until TSCC lost on Prop 8 and gay marriage in general, *in the United States*. TSCC is not a global church, it is an American church.

In reality, very few same-sex couples would bring children for the formal Church ordinance of naming and blessing, since this creates a formal membership record. But Church leaders want to avoid putting little children in a potential tug-of-war between same-sex couples at home and teachings and activities at church.

Bullshit! The initial policy was explicitly clear, "child of a parent who has lived or is living in a same-gender relationship." If the biological parents are divorced and one is not LDS anymore and is in a gay relationship, the children are subject to the rule change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The provisions of Handbook 1, Section 16.13, that restrict priesthood ordinances for minors, **apply only to those children whose primary residence is with a couple living in a same-gender marriage** or similar relationship.

This is a significant walkback from the earlier instructions of Handbook 1, 

A natural or adopted child of a parent living in a same-gender relationship, whether the couple is married or cohabiting,

What if a never-LDS woman is bisexual, and lives with another woman in college. Years later, she converts, marries a man, and has kids. Her children, even though she repented, were fucked over with the initial policy change.

When a child living with such a same-gender couple has already been baptized and is actively participating in the Church, provisions of Section 16.13 do not require that his or her membership activities or priesthood privileges be curtailed or that further ordinances be withheld.

This is a significant walkback from the very clear initial instructions. </TEXT>
