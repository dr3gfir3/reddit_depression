	<TEXT> About 10 years ago, this was different, everybody was creating his own engine. But games have become more complex, and there are now much more platforms. So for most people, this is not managable, and it is a no-brainer to use an existing game engine instead.

BTW, the part with
 that assets are usually paid for

 is also there when you are coding your own engine. Well, somehow, someone need to make your assets. And you are not likely to get them for free. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO that's perfectly OK. It's somehow just like some game developers adjust their prices to different regions (like expensive in Australia). As long as the plan works, and you can make money from your game without pissing off your customers, I'd say go for it. </TEXT>

What is a bit frustrating on reddit is that most interesting subreddits are usually booked out, and reddit does a very bad job at telling you when they are available again. The ad team on reddit has been told this several times already, but they don't seem to be interested in fixing this. </TEXT>

It is done with the library CopperLicht. The houses are done like in minecraft, with bricks. Hope to make them nicer in the near future, with smaller bricks. The terrain currently is just a sin/cos function. Grass is placed by a deterministic randomizer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice to hear that it worked nicely on the iPad too. I didn't think about support for this, but it was created using CopperLicht which includes support for mobiles. Adding a control for movement on touch devices is just about a line of code, I will do that for the next update. Thanks for the feedback! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help us translating the CopperCube 3D game editor </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-24 05:45:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi,

 it is pretty hard finding people who know game development jargon, and are translators, so I decided to made the translation of the CopperCube 3D editor a community effort. Help us translating the editor, and **you'll get a free CopperCube Professional license, worth 380 euro** as thank-you.  
  
  
So far, we already have translations for Russian, Turkish, German and English. Doing this is pretty easy, but probably a bit of work: There are about 950 strings in the editor (yes, that beast has a lot of features :) ).  
   
  
If you want to help, see [this thread with the details in the CopperCube forum](http://www.ambiera.com/forum.php?t=3889).

	<TITLE> CopperCube 5.2 released </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-27 10:47:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The game editor is now available in version 5.2. From the change log:

 Realistic Realtime Water  
 Added realtime reflecting water surfaces. There is now a special scene node which renders water surfaces and can be used to create rivers, lakes, and oceans. It is highly configurable, so it can be used to create various, realistic looking water surfaces. It works on all targets (Windows, Mac OS X, WebGL, Flash and Android)  
  
Procedural Tree Generator  
 There is now an interactive tree generation user interface for creating procedural generated 3D trees  
  
 Lots of smaller changes:  
 - DPAD support on Android  
 - updated and modernized user interface  
 - new prefabs  
 - 21 day trial (instead of 14 before)  
 - Localization (German and English for now)  
 and more  
  
[Details with screenshots](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/changelog.html)  
  
The WebGL backend also has been made open source recently, so this is also useful for programmers.  </TEXT>
