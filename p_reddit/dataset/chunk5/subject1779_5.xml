	<TEXT> Smut's not my cup of tea either, to the point of being a pet peeve. 

There's a few...kind-of-okay romance stories on AO3, but the only ones I'm familiar with are part of fandoms that are much, much smaller than Harry Potter.

Basically, there's this one sit-com that has fanfic that I...occasionally skim, though I rarely follow a fic closely.

But yeah, the smut on AO3 can make even Deviantart look respectable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think u/okmvfr is referring to James Garfield actually surviving for eleven weeks following the assassination. 

One of the bullets was lodged in Garfield's side, and doctors used dirty, unsterilized tools to attempt to find it (Not that they managed to find it; they were actually looking on the wrong side). Infections from the botched attempts to remove the bullet, combined with malnutrition brought on by Garfield's severely limited diet, contributed significantly to Garfield's death.

Many historians and doctors now hypothesize that had Garfield gotten proper medical attention with more capable doctors, he likely would have survived the assassination attempt.

The assassin, on the other hand, was put on trial in November of that year, in one of the first prominent cases involving an insanity defense. He was eventually sentenced to death in January, and executed by hanging in June 1882. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, my favorite Young Adult fiction author is Caroline Cooney. She's best-known for the *Face on the Milk Carton* books, but personally, my favorite is *A Friend At Midnight.* You want realistic teenagers? *A Friend At Midnight* is top-notch in that regard.

To me, I think the popularity in YA fiction is a mere advancement of the books about primary school aged children.

To clarify, the books we read in elementary school were often books about children our age. The cast of *Sideways Stories from Wayside School* are, what fourth graders? Encyclopedia Brown is ten. Harriet the Spy was in the sixth grade. Henry Huggins was eight in his first book, and twelve when his stories ended.

By comparison, a lot of the classics we read in high school were most certainly not about teenagers.

Now books about teenagers have existed for decades (Sweet Valley High comes most readily to mind), I think there was still a bit of a vacuum. Combine this vacuum with our desire to read about heroes, and the increasingly large number of Young Adult fiction makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A mixture of reasons.

Keep in mind, it's been quite some time since I saw the films.

**Shrek**

The first Shrek is a bit of a spoof on fairy tale movies. It plays with, while still maintaining many of their tropes. 

There's an ogre? He's not kidnapping anyone or destroying crops or livestock. He's not out to hurt anyone, he just wants to be let to his own devices.

There's a talking animal? It talks. That's it. There's no curse on it, it didn't use to be a human. It never shuts up. It's not a wise sage--though he does have some advice on when it comes to treating people  decent.

There's a quest to save the princess? The prince doesn't feel like doing it himself. He'll send a knight. But all the knights get beaten up? Okay, he'll send the one who beat them up.

You get the idea. But Shrek also holds true to some morals that are not completely unfamiliar to what you'd see in Disney fairy tales. "It's what's on the inside that counts" sounds very much like a lesson Disney would endorse (Beauty and the Beast, for one).
*****

**Shrek 2**

If the original film was a spoof on classic fairy tale ideas, then the sequel is a spoof on Disney itself. All the fairy tales are apparently real, and it's a whole world.

There's new environments--Far Far Away is a much larger city than the gimmicky Duluth. In a way, it's like the writers were making fun of themselves as much as Disney. They don't pull punches against anyone. A lot more jokes are made, many of them at Hollywood's expense in general. The award ceremonies, the gazillion Starbuck coffee shops, etc.

Shrek 2 also introduces characters that were quite new at the time. Puss in Boots is a trained assassin, but also steadfastly loyal to Shrek for sparing his life. A mercenary who has honor. 

Prince Charming is reminiscent of Gaston, but bratty and prone to tantrums. 

And the Fairy Godmother is brilliant. The best villains think themselves the heroes, and that is certainly true here.

And the themes are nice. 

While the first film was built on Shrek and Fiona overcoming their own personal insecurities, and falling in love, the sequel is focused on the idea of family. When you marry someone, you marry their family. And although Shrek loves Fiona, and he knows Fiona loves him back, the world still doesn't.

The overall theme of Shrek 2 appears to be not so much "it's on the inside that counts," but "you must value who you are, and who others are." It's not so much "Be Yourself," but "Be Your Best Self." Shrek may be an ogre, but that doesn't mean that he can't be friendly with his in-laws. 

Donkey and Puss are total opposites, but they can still be best friends, if the end of the film is any indication

King Harold has spent his entire adult life putting on a show, hiding his true nature, because he was ashamed. But in his actions with the Fairy Godmother, he became a very unpleasant person, that he himself dislikes. It is in his last act as a human, that he shows the best humanity, in his attempted Heroic Sacrifice to protect his daughter and son-in-law. He is reverted back to a frog, but Queen Lillian tells him that this is the best he's been in years.
******
Shrek the Third has none of that. 

The humor is a lot more crude--Dreamworks has a well-deserved reputation for crass humor and slapstick but there was a conspicuous lack of wit in Shrek 3 that had been present in the previous films.

The new characters are boring at best, and flat-out annoying at worst.

And the climax was supposed to be fantastic--Shrek is willing to sacrifice himself to save Prince Arthur, in front of all the villains of all the fairy tales.

But there wasn't any decent build up. Shrek and Arthur have very little rapport. 

Worst of all is the very boring moral. Arthur gives a little speech to the bad guys and it feels like an After School Special, and that's because it IS an After School Special. Arthur the High School Student tells all the bad guys that they can be anything they want and then that's IT. </TEXT>

These mecha--they can't be too large. My main heroes have melee weapons and small firearms. I can't let them get too overshadowed.

But how can they fight? I don't want them to just punch the bad guys to death. I could use giants for that.

Elementals...fire, water, earth, air, wood, metal....what if there were weapons that were these weapons in themselves...

Not blades that were on fire, not blades of pure plasma, but swords of actual fire. Or metallic weapons that could switch their state of matter (solid, liquid, gas). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like slice-of-life fics, especially those featuring Ginny and Luna's friendship. But keeping it platonic. Let some of Luna's Luna-ness rub off on Ginny. 

Ideas? It may be nice to see more of Remus as a teacher--not many fics focus on him during Prisoner of Azkaban, but don't have him pine over Sirius. How would he interact with McGonagall or Snape or Hagrid? Imagine his reaction if he overhears students bullying another (who may or may not be Luna)?

Plot points? I'd like to see more Harry-and-Dudley-reconciliation fics. Or where Krum stays behind at Hogwarts and joins the Order of the Phoenix.

Funny scene that I want to see? I'd like to have seen Sirius and Snape get into a fight. A Muggle duel where they pull hair and bite and kick and Sirius mentions that Snape has to get over the ghost of Lily.

Other funny scenes? Zacharias Smith getting beaten up in various ways would be nice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just saying I personally will have a hard time getting as emotionally invested in that as I was/am in Rogers/Evans.

Could part of it be how old we were when we saw it? Or what was going on in the world when it happened?

I was in college when Winter Soldier came out. My political leanings were shifting--Cap's ideals of right and wrong, combined with his resolve to stand against corruption and consolidation of power, was something I was experiencing first hand.

******

Maybe the trick is to see Evans in his other projects--he's got a new movie due out in just a few weeks.

If we get used to Evans as Not-Captain America, maybe that'll help seeing Not-Evans as Captain America. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I was just saying in another comment - my enjoyment of the MCU is so deeply tied to Chris Evans' depiction of Cap. When he leaves, it's going to be really hard for me to get as excited for future MCU stuff.

There's Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie. Assuming that Bucky and Falcon survive the Infinity War, one of them is bound to take up the mantle and be Captain. YMMV on Comic Captain Falcon, but if Mackie's improvement in *Civil War* over his already excellent role in *Winter Soldier* is a glimpse of things to come, I'm delighted.

I'm also keeping my fingers crossed for Falcon to appear in Black Panther.

Also, Black Panther. Black Panther is something to get excited about. He damn near stole the show back in *Civil War.*

I had high hopes for Spidey, but I'm really growing weary of RDJ's Tony Stark. I hope Spidey can succeed without a heavy dose of Iron Man.

Personally, I've long thought that Spidey is best suited for a Netflix series. Preferably one that takes a lot of influence from the animated *Spectacular Spider-Man.*

That said, I'm looking forward to the movie. Tom Holland did a great job.

As for Stark, I'm still fond of him, and since I barely knew of RDJ, I still like his interpretation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A perfect example of this, from *Winter Soldier,* concerns that one computer technician. His name is Cameron Klein.

Brock Rumlow and the rest of S.T.R.I.K.E. have guns pointed at him, demanding he release the codes. But he remembers Captain Rogers giving his little speech about how *the cost of freedom is high, but it's a price I'm willing to pay.*

The only person that Klein could take in a fight is pre-Serum Rogers. He knows that Rumlow could trounce him. He knows he'll get his brains blown out if he doesn't do what H.Y.D.R.A wants. But he still takes a stand.

What makes Captain America truly special is that he is able to make others take a stand as well.

Edit: I stand corrected. The name of the computer technician is Cameron Klein. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it is true that overall the number of guns in private hands in the United States has increased, the number of gun owners has been decreasing. 

In 2004, a Gallup survey 38% of Americans either owned guns or lived with someone who did. In the most recent survey (I think it was 2015), it was indicated that only 32% did.

Now, some have speculated that some of the respondents might not have been truthful, but that's speculation. </TEXT>

"Dead Beat" is probably my favorite of all the Dresden books, and Butters is a huge reason why.

Butters is the best ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats and have lots of random facts about them.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

The five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well. Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers."

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism. 

Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat and are actually somewhat smaller than their normal cousins. Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes. It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs.

When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

*****

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well.

	<TEXT> When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty, I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.

	<TEXT> I'm not much for shipping, so I'd like to see what fics you'd recommend that are "slice of life." Length doesn't matter to me too much, so long as it's well-written and the stakes are relatively low. Hogwarts or home are both fine, so long as it doesn't break canon too much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can understand your point. If the point of a comedy is to make people laugh, then it should also make sure that we're laughing for the right reasons.

Ideally, we need to be laughing *with,* not laughing *at.*

On that note, general silliness is a plus.

As a fan of Boy Meets World, I laugh hardest at Big Brother Eric's general silly goof-ups. Same logic applies with Kyle (We still don't know his last name) on Last Man Standing.

Now, there's definitely room for an "asshole" in a comedy. Take Scrubs--Dr. Cox is often very funny, especially when he yells at JD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always loved the big cats. Big cats, wolves, bears--they were my favorites. I used to read encyclopedia entries on them for fun. </TEXT>
