	<TEXT> All i remember from my first lucid dream is reaching up over my head to feel a long, warm, wrinkly arm (yes it was an arm) of a man before waking up terrified and looking around my room to see no one there. I could of sworn it was real and even asked my dad and brother if they had come into my room that night and they denied all knowledge.

	<TEXT> I really agree with this. I did not see the point either, they could of portrayed Harry and Ginny's relationship in numerous ways throughout the film, like they have in the book. It's like you said with the whole Voldermort thing, they totally contradicted themselves here with that. 

The only other thing I cant think of is that they put it in to add more action and get that in the film early than just right at the end. Maybe to also introduce some more death eaters rather than just Bellatrix, so that when the final scene with Dumbledore on the tower came about, the audience wouldn't be like 'Who the hell are they?'

Still a really pointless scene, they should of stuck with the book and have the minister coming to visit Harry to try and get him on the ministry's side, lot more sense. 

Sorry for rant haha :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In HBP when Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermionie are sitting by the common room fire and Ginny explains her discussion with Romilda Vain about Harry and his 'Tattoo'; 
"And what did you tell her Ron's got?" 
"A Pygmy Puff, but I didn't say where" 

Not only did I find it funny but it also highlights just how awesome and witty Ginny (My favourite charcter by far) is. Something I truly wish the movies had portrayed properly, making her a key character instead of the quiet as a mouse character you see her as. </TEXT>
