	<TEXT> Yeah I know. Nothing wrong with a little camp (which the arkham games have) and tonally the nolan duology was fine. Fantastic really, I appreciate batman begins so much more than I did way back in 2005. It and casino royale were the only "gritty/grimdark" reboots that actually focused on the heart and personal emotions of their characters, instead of just being gritty for the sake of it like other copycats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Batman is so broken that we'll probably never see a good live action version, he's better suited to cartoons. To be a good live action version he needs to have the martial arts prowess of Hong Kong action movies, with none of the quick sloppy editing that defines western action movies, and also have the strong characterization of western movies. 
The suit would probably also need to be cgi'd like black panther was, to give him full fluidity of movement, and do the awesome stunts that batman of the arkham games does. Could you imagine if we got a live action version of that? So awesome... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Dark Knight manages to be one of the greatest movies of all time despite the fact that poor heath ledger died during post production, so we'll never know what could have been if he hadn't killed himself and taken a fistful of pills (still don't understand why he'd do that...)

So yeah, I still regard it as an incomplete movie. 

Also, why didn't batman just throw a batarang at the end there to disarm 2face... it's like his iconic weapon, the very thing used when crooks are holding guns. 

But yeah don't even go there. I don't even acknowledge tdkr as the same series as BB and TDK. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why did the death of his ex cause him to retire when he became Batman as a result of his parents being shot in front of him?

Why did Talia and Bane's plot require so much time that it allowed her to let her sworn enemy put his Batdick in her mouth?

Why did Gotham literally send 98% of its police force underground?

Why did Bane's goons armed with assault weapons not shoot at the unarmed malnourished police force?

Why did Gotham believe Bane's reading of Gordon's letter at face value right after bombing a stadium and sacking the city?

Why was Bruce's power cut literally the day after being bankrupted when PG E let me float two months past due when I was in college?

Why did the Gotham paper misspell "heist"?"

I just was hoping someone got the reference of krysten ritter playing a character in dttbia23 and having an episode where she is a superheroess and has her own comic books that someone drew portraying her as such, and then she went on to actually be  a comic book superhero character, in jessica jones. But I guess not) </TEXT>

I can't stress how peeved I am at the focus on the "past" bits with jlaw, this whole nonsense about her losing her "innocence" by killing for the first time, what nonsense... also wouldn't it make more sense for the sentinels to have been created from rogue or I don't know, someone with copying powers...

Then it wouldn't be as much of a horribly brought back cliche of the black guy dying first. Plus it would have led to a nice tease for the sequel. Or at least it would have if days of future past hadn't killed off almost the entire first class team, and also any good that movie brought back to the stagnating movie franchise...


Then again it wasn't a big name actor that played him so unlike stupid jlaw there's no chance of bringing him back huh...  </TEXT>

Anyway I always thought this movie is what started Tom Cruise's revitalization in awesome movie roles again, because in the 2000s he faced some popularity backlash (and the scientology thing didn't help) but since then the 2010s have seen him be in some great films and he himself showed how great he was in them.

- Colored in

Last one isn't necessary but appreciate it if found. I've liked pisu hame a lot (inexperienced boy that all the experienced girls want to fuck and get creampied by? That's pretty 10/10) and some of the Kisaragi Gunma titles like a straight line to love. Mai favorite is also great. 

Any like that would be appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds awesome lol, wish I could have been a part of that. 

I identified a lot with Tobias and always thought about what it would be like to fly away and be a hawk. His whole entire arc was about how he was slowly distancing himself from humanity, living like a predator, through the rules of nature etc. I could identify with that, as I was similar to Tobias as a kid. 

I was glad when the the ellimist have him morphing powers again though and he was no longer a nothlit </TEXT>

I remember owning so many books and picture books on all the different types, some posing questions like what really did kill the dinosaurs eg meteor, starvation, drought..

I'll never forget that passage in megamorphs that said dinosaur flesh tasted like fish, when the kids were eating it. For some reason that really stuck with me, why did Applegate think dinosaurs tasted similar to fish? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know right? Sometimes I forget that they were barely teenagers when the series began, and were still teenagers by the end of the war. They acted so much older than their age, considerably so in hindsight, and that's not even counting the loss of innocence from basically being... well it's kinda like child soldiers isn't it? Especially when they recruit the disabled kids at the hospital, I mean boy that was.... that was dark, especially their rationale behind it. 

Yeah the series is a lot darker when you think about it. 

I liked Megamorphs as well, and I enjoyed the one with them going back in time with the dinosaurs, though I think Elfangor's Secret might be my favorite? Actually I can't remember why the book was even called that, it had nothing to do with Elfangor did it? His only secret being he was actually the dad of Tobias? Also now that I think about it were **all** the Megamorphs books involving time travel? Huh. </TEXT>

You know what's unfortunate though? I never got a chance to read Visser back during the height of my Animorphs fandom. I just never found the book.

	<TEXT> Neither. A game is only counted when the developers themselves actually announce it, and Atlus aren't showy developers, they only recently announced it. 

Although, some did speculate back when Catherine came out that it was clearly to test the engine (at least graphically) for persona 5. Anyway can't wait for the game, and also can't believe they made a ps4 port instead of focusing on just the ps3, like how p4 was ps2 only and not simultaneously released on ps3. Ah well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a rule of thumb, the longer a game goes through development hell, and the longer the delays are, the worse the final product ends up being, either actuarial or simply from hype-to-expectation letdown (which of course isn't really a fault of the game itself)

I mean the most famous example is duke nukem forever, but there have been several others. 

However RE 4 went through around 6 years of development time (and this was early 2000s, so inflation of development time in mind this would be like 12 years with today's expensive technology and subsequent long development times) and got scrapped several times, with one of the scrapped designs actually ending up being a whole new game (Devil May Cry) which I definitely think is downright unheard of and unique in the video game industry. 

Just wondering what other game took a really long time (let's say, 5+ years minimum?) but still ended up good. I think I recall one of the marios like super mario galaxy but can't be sure? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the weirdest movies. It's a sequel to Desperado, the 3rd in Robert Rodriguez's el mariachi trilogy. I dunno, something about the movie has a real surreal vibe throughout. 

In particular is the scene with Johnny Depp and eva Mendes where she scoops his eyes out (what in the actual fuck) and he has empty eye sockets the rest of the movie, and instead of going "what the fuuuuuck?????!!!" like the audience is going, he just sorta goes with it, puts on a pair of sunglasses, and moves along with the plot. 

It's just so... not normal reaction to having your eyes scooped out and going blind. 

That's the part of the movie that always makes me absolutely bewildered.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I became crazy about mcu right around the time of watching agents of shield. Loved it from the very first episode, had a very whedon esque buffy scooby doo gang vibe to it, then the hydra twist happened and everything got flipped/turned upside down. 

Then season 2 happened and it was by far the greatest thing on television of that year. I mean agents of shield season 2 was just immaculate. The finale of that year had me on the edge of my seat moreso than the entirety of avengers 2's disappointing mess, that's how much I loved agents of shield season 2, with skye and the inhumans and discovering her parentage and tying those particular plot threads from season 1, that hit really close to home for me. 

Season 3 couldn't (and didn't) follow up on the amazingness that was season 2, but I just hate the fact that season 4 might be the show's last, because more people are tuning in to watch CW's teenage fest superhero shows than agents of shield and netflix's mcu shows. 

Oh well. I enjoy agents of shield, enjoyed agent carter (shame it got canceled) and am going through luke cage now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And see, *that's* how I thought they were going to make the ninja and punisher plot line intersect. By having punisher just shoot them all, since I was expecting the show to go the subversion route with mystical ninjas since they seemed to be building that up with daredevil questioning stick's "fortune cookie nonsense" so having it end with punisher showing you can take these so called magic cult dudes with regular bullets would shatter the illusion of this magic war. 

But I guess they didn't go that route, they played it straight instead of subversion.  </TEXT>

Because I  was so sure that was how they were going to introduce the Punisher (costume and all), by having him take out like the entire gang in an anti-climactic way where daredevil and Elektra are just stunned by how easy it was, in a classic nod to when Indiana Jones took out the guy with a sword with just one shot. 

Instead he shows up after most were already taken out and 4 remained? Less of an epic intro to punisher's intro.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's a guy with such a selective choice of movies that he only does a couple every decade, and has now won 3 oscars, securing the most out of any actor in history.

9 is not a bad movie per se, it's just... eh, you know? A cliche riddled meh movie that DDL had decided to star in, and in the movie itself has Marion Cotillard as a wife but decides to cheat with Penlope Cruz? Over Marion Cotillard? Absolutely absurd.

I've always wondered why he chose that, when in the past the kind of movies he's chosen were My Left Foot, Last of the Mohicans, Gangs of New York, and Lincoln. Nine seems like an odd misstep (again not a bad movie but... considering DDL's picky tastes, what made him choose this over other roles)

The movie is a musical and I guess it's alright, the songs are kinda catchy and I guess that's all that matters, I'm assuming he chose the role because he wanted to try his hand at singing. But otherwise it's a very uninteresting movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh that's a whole nother issue with American mainstream porn (which I incidentally don't watch, for so many reasons) in that it's so sterile and just non-erotic. There's never any kissing, any actual touching, communication (besides the oh so boner killing generic statements like "oh yeah oh fuck oh fuck" which make me go flaccid instantly because they're just so stupid) between the partners over what they like, what they enjoy, and communication, actual sensuality is more of a turn-on for me than the Ikea-esque porn of a guy just shoving his dick in and out of a girl. I prefer actual communication, like a girl telling the guy to rub her there, or in the heat of the moment telling him to bite her, or just actual back and forth, like the guy saying how much he enjoys being with her and how great it feels with her. Anything in that range. 

What I like from European porn or X-Art/Joymii/Sexart is when the partners are actually caressing each other, kissing a lot (which is my favorite thing) and slowly go from foreplay to intense passion, there's an actual buildup to it instead of disgusting mainstream American porn where the guy slaps his dick on the girl's face. Who finds that sexy? I know I don't. Oh also the guys in X-Art/Joymii etc are usually very handsome, fit, have six packs and just a nice physique, which I have to say is a welcome change from the fat hairy Ron Jeremy types of American porn hehe :P.  </TEXT>
