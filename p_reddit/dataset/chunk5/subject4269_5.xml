	<TEXT> Yes exactly! I've cut my short angled Bob for 10+ years and the two times I visited a salon I wasn't all that impressed. Seemed like they didn't know what to do with my multi-direction hair at the back either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I've cut my own for over 10 years. I have a short, angled Bob and people are always impressed with the cut and I'm frequently asked where I get my hair done. It's not always perfect at the back but I can't imagine the amount of money I've saved. 

I also cut my husband and my two boys' hair with a clipper. I wasn't great at first but now I have to say I am pretty decent. I've cut other people's hair too but I am pretty nervous. 

I would say if you keep practising you'll get pretty good and save a ton of money,  especially women.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all,

I've been reading up on this subreddit because I finally need to start taking control of my finances. I'm not sure if any background information is relevant so please let me know if I need to provide more info.

Right now I have very little in my chequing account.  In my savings account I have about $1100.  And on my credit card I have about $1000.  

I just want to double check that it would be wiser to keep the money in savings (ie as an emergency fund) rather than pay off the (I think relatively) low credit card balance all at once.  It feels very tempting to just wipe out the CC balance because I can probably only contribute $50-100 to pay off that balance.

Any advice / criticism is welcome.  I have been foolish with money and need to get a grip because I am 33 and have no retirement savings what-so-ever.

Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really good advice about the teacher and I agree about just finding one other kid.  I'm going to try to take some time off work and volunteer in the classroom so I can get a feel for the kids and maybe meet another parent or two.  Thanks for your input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, I'll look for it in the issue.  I guess my instinct is to just flee the problem rather than try to deal with it, which is what that program would be more about (dealing with it, which is the better more healthy idea of course).  I think I would feel better about the whole thing if I even knew one other parent.  I used to volunteer so much in the classroom but now since I'm working I can never help out. :-( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone,

Problem: Today my son came home quite despondent from school saying he isn't in any group and the other kids are ignoring him and excluding him.

Background: At the end of June we moved from a large diverse city to a suburb that's much more homogeneous.  The kid's last school was small, near a University and we'd been included in the community after joining the community playschool many years ago.  So my son had grown up with many of the kids and they had shared interests, like video games and toys.  The new school is on the edge of the suburb and also serves rural students who get bused in.  It has a more "country" feel and reminds me of the small-town school I grew up with (for better or worse).  We started this September.  I am starting to dislike the school for a few minor, petty reasons, but I am trying not to let that cloud my judgement and also my Kindergartener seems to love it.

Situation:  The boys in the class (when you're in grade 3 of course you don't really want to play with the girls I guess though he had a few girl friends at the last school) seem to be ignoring Aidan and excluding him from the lunch table.  The classic "oh we're saving this seat for someone" or "we only want 5 people at the table" bullshit.  I have seen him walk up to a group of boys in the morning and he doesn't seem to say anything (shy) but they don't seem to even acknowledge him.  There was another new boy in the class and he said that they include him.  They also pick him last for everything.  He says they don't share the same interests (Star Wars) and I've observed that the school has a greater emphasis on sports (hockey, this is Canada) so I wonder if he isn't connecting on that level.

Another problem is that I've started working full-time for the first time ever so I don't have the opportunity to see the other parents or socialize.  Everyone in the community we moved to has kids going to schools all over so I haven't found any kids that actually go to this school in particular.  We bought a house next to this school so the kids could walk. And we couldn't afford to buy in our old neighborhood.

It's breaking my heart.  I was never a popular kid but I always had  friends because I'd been in my hometown my entire life. I want to help him but now sure to what extent to do it.  Here are my possible solutions:

* talk to the teacher to see what she suggests
* work with him to improve his likeability/interaction (horrible, he should not have to change)
* ask to switch to the other Grade 3 class in the school
* consider switching schools, but there's no guarantee the kids would be any better at a different one and we also had a hard time finding out of school care anywhere.
* ????


Any advice / perspective / ideas, etc would be welcome!!!! I feel so bad for him and I don't want him to be the outcast. He had a great group of friends in the old school who still miss him and love him.

Thanks. </TEXT>
