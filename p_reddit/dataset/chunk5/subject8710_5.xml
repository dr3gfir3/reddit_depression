Mourinho won the first treble in Serie A history and Heynckes won the first treble in Bundesliga history - equally as impressive. He won the Intertoto Cup twice with Schalke   ended Real Madrid's European Cup drought since 1966. Heynckes also led Borussia Mnchengladbach to the UEFA Cup final. Heynckes deserves to be here. </TEXT>

Each of them have been dominant throughout different periods and sometimes simultaneously. 

I'd also like to give an honorable mention to Squirtle. While he's probably not the best Protoss player ever, the GSL final vs. Mvp was one of the best performances I've ever seen and I've never admired a Protoss players play like Squirtle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Women like men that are "upfront". And chase her if you have to, sometimes you just have to. I've ended up sleeping with some girls after chasing them for a while after being rejected at first. I would say ask her out again and suggest different things because not every girl is down to "go for a drink". If it doesn't work out then go after other girls but keep her as a friend because you never know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In terms of talent, producing the best players, etc. who would you guys say are the top nations?

For me:

- Korea 

I mean, it's Korea. Don't really have to explain.

- Canada

Been producing top-tier players for years such as Grrr, HuK, Scarlett, MaSa, KiWiKaKi, TT1, David Kim, etc. Won the 1st OSL, deep runs in GSL, and numerous premier tournament wins. 

- Not sure

The 3rd spot is why I made this thread. I feel like there are a lot of options here. The US nowadays but historically France, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Taiwan, and others. </TEXT>

She's Eastern European, green eyes, blonde hair, big tits, pretty much the ideal milf. I never thought it would go anywhere with her but we ended up sleeping together recently and now I don't even think about my ex. I've learned that there are a lot of women out there so don't ever be hung up over your ex.

Eastern European women are the best. Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech, Austrian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, etc. are truly the hottest ethnicities in my opinion. Anybody else agree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the Super Bowl era, who do you guys say is the best rushing QB of all-time?

For a quick comparison:

Cam Newton has *much* more rushing TDs.

Michael Vick has *much* more rushing YDs.

Both were #1 picks in the NFL Draft and the similarities are endless. What does r/NFL think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which university did you write your PhD essay on Inter's history at? Still bitter over losing a European Cup to Inter? 

Real Madrid sanctioned rival clubs in La Liga making it a 1 horse race. Real Madrid had a ban on Kubala. The 'great' Real Madrid erased the competition. But keep talking about Inter. </TEXT>
