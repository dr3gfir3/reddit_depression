	<TEXT> The big ones that always shock people when I tell them I can't watch them because I need to read the books are Silence of the Lambs, Oil! (There Will Be Blood), most of the film noirs (Laura comes to mind), No Country for Old Men, Forrest Gump, Schindler's List (I have read the book, it is dense), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Shrek, and Trainspotting (watched before I realized it was a book). Before I get hate, not everyone is a book buff like all of us so people do actually get surprised when there is a lesser known book that preceded a blockbuster movie. 
Also there are some movie interpretations of books that people do not know exist such as Lolita (it's directed by Kubrick!).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Newbie needs help with postmodernism </TITLE>

	<TEXT> This week, for some strange reason, I have become increasingly interested in postmodernist literature. I have heard the greats are Gaddis, Pynchon, Delilo, DFW, Gass, Eco, etc. I have read a bit of DFW's work (mainly his nonfiction; opinion- his nonfiction is much more interesting than his short fiction). I need help finding a starting place. Do any of you wonderful people know a good video series, lectures, or introductory books that help explain postmodernist literature? I also would love it if someone could recommend a good starting place with actual author's works. The authors I am interested in are mainly Pynchon and Gaddis (because I can not find a clear starting point for either). But I am also interested in other authors. I know the big red box staring at me is saying I can't ask for recommendations but have mercy upon me Reddit moderators. Thanks ahead of time all commenters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Magic Mountain, by Thomas Mann**

**Winesburg Ohio, by Sherwood Anderson**

The Magic Mountain is captivating and a lot easier  than everyone says it is.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say they are biased in the sense that O'Reilly and Duggard selectively chose facts. I read both Killing Kennedy and Killing Reagan and the both leave out facts that they deemed not important towards their goals with the books. They are more general overviews of the events of the people they are covering's lives. They are good reads but not necessarily the most informative books on Kennedy, Reagan, Lincoln etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Swann's Way, by Marcel Proust** 

**Journey to the End of the Night, by Louis-Ferdinand Celine**

 Almost done with Swann's Way. I read 50 pages a day for the last week. I recommend the Lydia Davis Translation.

	<TEXT> I agree with the Fagles translation advice. However I would recommend before reading to do a little research on The Odyssey. It is a "sequel" to the Iliad and there are a ton of references to events or characters in the Iliad. I would also recommend the Crash Course videos on The Odyssey. John Green is bae.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Up until this year I never reread a book. I felt that I understood a book enough the first time reading it, thus it would be pointless to waste the time reading it again. Then I decided to reread a few of the books I "read" for class in high school. I reread Catcher in the Rye and The Great Gatsby. Catcher in the Rye was a nice reread but because it had been 4 years since I was 15, relating to the "teen angst" was not there. I did feel the isolation feeling. The Great Gatsby was a huge disappointment. I had spent the year reading Fitzgerald's other novels. When I reread Gatsby the novel did not stand up to his other novels. It is a very overrated novel but is worth reading. I recommend everyone rereads their high school reading list. Your favorite or least favorite books may have a new effect on you the second time around.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Chronicle of a Death Foretold, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez** 
I've wanted to get into Marquez for a long time and thought this short book would be a perfect introduction.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime by Mark Haddon is an emotional rollercoaster. It teeters between a funny novel and a depressing novel.  </TEXT>
