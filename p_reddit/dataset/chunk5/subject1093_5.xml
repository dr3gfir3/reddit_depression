	<TEXT> Hey there! Your post has been removed because you did not include a correct tag at the **beginning** of your title. Without this, I'm not able to assign the appropriate flair. Please re-submit your post with one of the following tags in the title.

Your post will also be removed if the title is in all caps or if there are less than 2 words in the title (not including the tag). Please be sure to use a descriptive title.

If you're unsure of what tag to use, then [Question] or [Discussion] would probably work for most borderline cases. Thanks!

Tag | Usage
:--|:--
[Release] | New tweaks that have just been released or submitted
[Update] | Existing tweaks that have just been updated
[Beta] | Tweaks currently in beta
[Upcoming] | Tweaks currently in development
[News] | Tweak and jailbreak related news
[Discussion] | Jailbreak related discussions where anyone can give their opinion. For example, favorite/recommended tweaks, tweak concepts, tweak configurations, etc.
[Question] or [Help]| Troubleshooting jailbreak or tweak related issues and questions
[Request] | Requests for a tweak to be made or updated
[Tutorial] | How-to posts
[Meta] | Posts about /r/jailbreak itself
[Giveaway] | Theme or tweak giveaways
[Tip] | Shorter how-to posts

**NOTE: ** If you wish to use multiple tags, please do not "split" your tags like this: `[Question/Discussion]`. They should be separate like this: `[Question] [Discussion]`.

	<TEXT> **/u/safehealth, Your submission title isn't right for listentothis!** We have to remove it.

Artist Name -- Song Name [genre genre] (year) 

For example: Three Trapped Tigers -- Reset [math rock] (2012) 

The ' -- ' spaces around the dash and the [brackets around the genres] must be included.

Click on the 'delete' option above to remove this before submitting again.

The submission guidelines are summarized on the submit page for quick reference.

The reasons for these community guidelines are explained in the [subreddit introduction.](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette)

If reddit displays a message telling you to wait a little while before submitting again, moderators are NOT able to assist with this. This is a site-wide feature, and the message will not appear once your account age and total karma exceed required thresholds. [Verifying your email address](http://reddit.com/verify) can help resolve this issue.

Preferred sites are: [soundcloud](//soundcloud.com), [bandcamp](//bandcamp.com), [youtube](//youtube.com], [vimeo](vimeo.com), and [spotify](//spotify.com).  These work best with reddit's embedding feature.  It is *highly unlikely* that you'll be unable to find the content you're trying to submit on these sites.  Spotify should only be used as a last resort, as many users do not have access. *Please* use conventional URLs, *not mobile links.*

If this stream is an exclusive release only appearing on one specific website, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/listentothis subject=One-time site approval!) and we will review your subimssion.  Please ensure that you have searched for the artist on each of our preferred sites before contacting us.

If this stream is a bandcamp or soundcloud link that is being embedded in the artist's home page, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/listentothis subject=Bandcamp or Soundcloud on Artist's Website!) to request manual approval.

	<TEXT> Get your dunce hats out, Fittit, it's time for your triweekly Stupid Questions Thread.

Post your question - stupid or otherwise - here to get an answer. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer. Many questions get submitted late each week that don't get a lot of action, so if your question didn't get answered before, feel free to post it again.

**As always, be sure to read the FAQ first.**

Also, there's a handy-dandy search bar to your right, and if you didn't know, you can also use Google to search fittit by using the limiter "site:reddit.com/r/fitness".

Be sure to check back often as questions get posted throughout the day. Lastly, it may be a good idea to sort comments by "new" to be sure the newer questions get some love as well.

So, what's rattling around in your brain this week, Fittit?

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)

We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

Please read through the [NewTubers Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/52atut/newtubers_rules_v21/) so that you can understand what this community is about and the rules it abides by.

As such, it may be easiest for you to observe for a bit how the community operates before diving in and asking for feedback on your channel.  If you're ever unsure of how things work, you can always ask the Mod team!  We'd rather you ask *beforehand* than get your posts removed for violating a rule.

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

	<TEXT> IMPORTANT: Here is an explanation of [what sort of content belongs on /r/WoahDude](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_.22woahdude_material.22.3F). If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Please note that it does not matter whether a post has 1 karma or 1000 karma. (I'm sure a leaked photo of Natalie Portman nude would get lots of upvotes too, but we will protect the integrity of our subreddit and remove it anyway, sadly. It's not all about the upvotes.)

TL;DR - We are NOT interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other "general" subreddits meant for sharing interesting or amazing content.

Instead, we're specifically made for **trippy or mesmerising** stuff that makes you go "woah dude!" in the way a stoned person says *woah dude* when confronted with something that tickles their mind or senses. In other words, we have a bit of a psychedelic slant. We're not about posting things that are merely neat or amazing, but instead, things that sort of mess with your mind, warp your reality. Things that might make a sober person feel like they're on drugs, or really disorient people who are already on them. 

Mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerising. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness.

	<TEXT> IMPORTANT: Here is an explanation of [what sort of content belongs on /r/WoahDude](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_.22woahdude_material.22.3F). If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Please note that it does not matter whether a post has 1 karma or 1000 karma. (I'm sure a leaked photo of Natalie Portman nude would get lots of upvotes too, but we will protect the integrity of our subreddit and remove it anyway, sadly. It's not all about the upvotes.)

TL;DR - We are NOT interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other "general" subreddits meant for sharing interesting or amazing content.

Instead, we're specifically made for **trippy or mesmerising** stuff that makes you go "woah dude!" in the way a stoned person says *woah dude* when confronted with something that tickles their mind or senses. In other words, we have a bit of a psychedelic slant. We're not about posting things that are merely neat or amazing, but instead, things that sort of mess with your mind, warp your reality. Things that might make a sober person feel like they're on drugs, or really disorient people who are already on them. 

Mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerising. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness. 

Think of the bizarre, erratic and psychedelic nature of Adult Swim. Or the wondrous, mind-expanding, awe-inspiring nature of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Or even the reality distorting, confusing, mind-fucking nature of Eternal Darkness for Gamecube. We're all of that.

	<TEXT> Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abtkq/worst_or_useless_superpowers_you_can_think_of/).

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

	<TEXT> Hello /u/mishranamitmishra! It looks like you're trying to post a direct image, or something that might not be the original source, to /r/dataisbeautiful. **I've removed the current thread,** since you're probably trying to do one of three things. Let me help you with posting...

---

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [complete original source article](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization *where it was originally introduced* by the author (not an image on the site, but **the actual full web page article**). [More information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Need+help+finding+the+original+source message=I+need+help+finding+the+original+source+of+this+image:).
        
---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Resubmit your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. subject1093 will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_plagiarism.3F) in this subreddit. No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.
        
---

##If the original source is a PDF:

*Leave your post as-is* and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Exception+for+PDF message=I+need+an+exception+for+this+post:%0A%0AOriginal+PDF:). We'll make an exception for you. In your modmail message, be sure to include the original PDF.

Your post will be manually approved by the mod team, and we'll sticky the original PDF to the top of the comment thread so our readers can get context.

	<TEXT> It seems you are possibly discussing stealing or stealing-related topics. Although this is against every countries' rules (and even a pesky commandment or two to those non-atheist filth), it's important to remember to be responsible. Content creators can only create said content because they receive funding from things you shit on.

Stealing is an important freedom in our fascist dictatorships, and it's important to remember these things before you pass rightful judgement on thieves discussing it:

 Some steal games because they believe the creator doesn't deserve financial compensation for the state of the product that was released. Those people are dicks.

 Some steal something that they already bought simply to remove the DRM. Which is just another word for stealing.

 Some steal to emulate NES games they definitely had 25 years ago. I signed that waiver Bill Clinton.

 Some steal to try products before they make a financial commitment to them. Just like WinZIP.

 Some steal simply because they cannot afford it. They are like Aladdin. But instead of stealing life sustaining nourishment, it's No Man's Sky.

 Some steal to get something that's no longer available. Nobody actually does, but we'll leave this here because it's the one of two somewhat legitimate reasons.

 Some steal because their country censors or doesn't import it. Despite the irony that pirating was stealing things from other countries, this is a somewhat valid reason to do so. Please move to a new fascist dictatorship.

 Some steal games because of timed exclusivity. If they don't have access to it yet, they use piracy as a method to access it before it's available to them. Just like when Greg who works at Gamestop slips me a copy on Monday. I'll totally pay him, er, uh Gamestop later.

Lastly, here's a few tips: AdBlock is awesome for hiding fake download links. Fake download links are usually a sign of a reputable website, please don't help fund them. Deluge is an excellent open-source client that isn't in close cooperation with the MPAA (unlike uTorrent, uninstall it as soon as possible, OH MY GOD, I'M GONNA CUM). Oh, and remember: torrenting in itself isn't illegal, and it's probably not stealing! It's simply a method of transferring copyrighted files. It's what copyrighted data you transfer that matters.

If you're submitting fanart, you may link directly to a DeviantArt page, ArtStation portfolio, blog, etc.  If you're submitting a Play of the Game or other Highlight, you'll need to use a Video/GIF host such as YouTube or Gfycat.   

Imgur posts are automatically removed, even if its a GIFV, as we're not able to detect which type it is.

	<TEXT> IMPORTANT: Here is an explanation of [what sort of content belongs on /r/WoahDude](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_.22woahdude_material.22.3F). If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Please note that it does not matter whether a post has 1 karma or 1000 karma. (I'm sure a leaked photo of Natalie Portman nude would get lots of upvotes too, but we will protect the integrity of our subreddit and remove it anyway, sadly. It's not all about the upvotes.)

TL;DR - We are NOT interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other "general" subreddits meant for sharing interesting or amazing content.

Instead, we're specifically made for **trippy or mesmerising** stuff that makes you go "woah dude!" in the way a stoned person says *woah dude* when confronted with something that tickles their mind or senses. In other words, we have a bit of a psychedelic slant. We're not about posting things that are merely neat or amazing, but instead, things that sort of mess with your mind, warp your reality. Things that might make a sober person feel like they're on drugs, or really disorient people who are already on them. 

Mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerising. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness. 

Think of the bizarre, erratic and psychedelic nature of Adult Swim. Or the wondrous, mind-expanding, awe-inspiring nature of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Or even the reality distorting, confusing, mind-fucking nature of Eternal Darkness for Gamecube. We're all of that.

Examples of material that is considered trippy or mesmerizing include but are not limited to:

* **Intense use of color and patterns:** [Intricate designs](http://i.imgur.com/UnbMnGl.jpg), [intense colors](https://i.giphy.com/26AHL9ByMyHJzgjkc.gif), [complex geometry](http://imgur.com/a/BAJ8j), [hyperrealism](http://imgur.com/a/xVX48), [fractals](http://i.giphy.com/xT0BKzyF3d7ljlJpug.gif), [recursion](http://i.imgur.com/HiwhxED.gifv), [psychedelia](http://www.oddityart.com/), [abstract art](http://i.imgur.com/ARL6oWs.gifv)
* **Extreme perspective:** [Macrophotography](http://imgur.com/a/vvvmC), [electron micrographs](http://imgur.com/tk9HiBi), [astrophotography](http://i.imgur.com/CWDYFwa.jpg)    
* **Giving a new understanding:** [Mathematical visualizations](http://imgur.com/gallery/moDHTKh), [scientific visualizations](http://imgur.com/FTeAKrr), [engineering visualizations](http://imgur.com/gallery/oC8j4Kn), [data visualizations](http://i.imgur.com/cpHrPyQ.jpg), [physics explanations](http://i.imgur.com/INKrGUS.gifv), exploded diagrams, [cross-sections](http://i.imgur.com/4n7hroi.jpg), [scientific art](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/2bv5b6/watercolors_added_to_ferrofluid_and_then_placed/), [reconsidering assumptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/12y8j4/the_rock_is_in_a_pool_pic/), [reframing perspective](https://i.imgur.com/gz4R6ty.gifv)
* **Altered reality:** [Slow motion footage](http://i.imgur.com/lFatiV7.gifv), [stop motion footage](http://i.imgur.com/00At51C.gifv), [bullet time](http://i.imgur.com/LqzejN9.gifv), [compositing](http://i.imgur.com/MtNUELc.gifv), [long exposure](http://i.imgur.com/9EAxa00.jpg), [special effects](http://i.imgur.com/P8DMiGR.gifv), [drug trip simulation](https://gfycat.com/PastBossyAxolotl)
* **Mesmerizing:** [Cinemagraphs](http://imgur.com/gallery/9cR4L), [chill music](http://open.spotify.com/user/123156102/playlist/0EedULhw6qjt7m6PD0Zsjb), [tranquil art](http://imgur.com/a/JN5Z7), [repetitive mechanical motion](http://i.imgur.com/jBG8fcN.gif), [interactive art](http://weavesilk.com/)
* **Sensory confusion:** [Optical illusions](http://imgur.com/a/VIeMk), [distortion](http://i.imgur.com/jHaAm.gif), [aural illusions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IXm6SuUigI), [stereograms](http://imgur.com/a/iGNlP), etc.
* **Cognitive confusion:** [Surrealism](http://imgur.com/gallery/8s9f5), [absurdism](http://i.imgur.com/G7p2clq.gif), [fifth-world art](http://i.imgur.com/HmtdV.jpg, [mystical art](http://i.imgur.com/LUzuxmr.jpg), [hypnagogia](http://imgur.com/a/kYONn), [strangeness](http://i.imgur.com/4MihoxD.gifv), [the fantastic](https://gfycat.com/LeafyPowerlessCorydorascatfish), [disjointedness](http://i.imgur.com/8PTGLci.gifv), [random and erratic behavior](http://i.imgur.com/dacZgCw.gifv), [datamoshing](https://i.imgur.com/zcuAETF.gifv), [pareidolia](http://imgur.com/OhwaPuD), [paradoxes](http://i.imgur.com/u6rR3BA.gifv), [strange philosophy](http://imgur.com/a/fRuFd?gallery), [strange science](http://imgur.com/gallery/crbiq), [cuil theory](http://shiranuiamaterasu.tumblr.com/post/33080297938)

Material that is NOT considered woahdude material:

* **~~Rarity~~:** ~~Rare talents, dangerous stunts, extreme human abilities, 1-in-a-million shots, sports highlights, etc.~~ **This type of trippiness is not allowed in WoahDude. It would totally flood our subreddit with stuff that's better suited for larger general subreddits like /r/videos, /r/gifs, etc. where these things are already very common.**

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6absym/natural_disaster_survival_stories/).

	<TEXT> Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

	<TEXT> Hello, Your post appears to be too vague and breaks Rule 6 (and possibly others) of /r/mildlyinteresting and has been removed. Your title must be a concise description of the content. No jokes, backstories or other fluff. "This was inside my car" or "The way this door opens" are unacceptable. It should act as a "spoiler" for the image. If it leaves the viewer surprised in some way after viewing, it will be removed. [Read about rule 6 in more detail here or in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/21p15y/rule_6_for_dummies/). Still unsure? Feel free to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmildlyinteresting) with a link to this post for a detailed explanation.

	<TEXT> Hey there! Your post has been removed because you did not include a correct tag at the **beginning** of your title. Without this, I'm not able to assign the appropriate flair. Please re-submit your post with one of the following tags in the title.

Your post will also be removed if the title is in all caps or if there are less than 2 words in the title (not including the tag). Please be sure to use a descriptive title.

If you're unsure of what tag to use, then [Question] or [Discussion] would probably work for most borderline cases. Thanks!

Tag | Usage
:--|:--
[Release] | New tweaks that have just been released or submitted
[Update] | Existing tweaks that have just been updated
[Beta] | Tweaks currently in beta
[Upcoming] | Tweaks currently in development
[News] | Tweak and jailbreak related news
[Discussion] | Jailbreak related discussions where anyone can give their opinion. For example, favorite/recommended tweaks, tweak concepts, tweak configurations, etc.
[Question] or [Help]| Troubleshooting jailbreak or tweak related issues and questions
[Request] | Requests for a tweak to be made or updated
[Tutorial] | How-to posts
[Meta] | Posts about /r/jailbreak itself
[Giveaway] | Theme or tweak giveaways
[Tip] | Shorter how-to posts

**NOTE: ** If you wish to use multiple tags, please do not "split" your tags like this: `[Question/Discussion]`. They should be separate like this: `[Question] [Discussion]`.
