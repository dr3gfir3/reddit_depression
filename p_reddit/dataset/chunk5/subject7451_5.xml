	<TEXT> This right here is just eerie:

*Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements  extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If/when the first is the most popular, we try to do that.  But that wasn't the first.  So you still would have been asking your question.

And it's a valid question.  But this generally always is our policy--and, again, it has nothing to do with not having fun.  It has to do with trying to be fair to everyone. 

As an aside, most mods with whom we've been in contact report that they face the same challenges in these types of situations.  Everyone says that no matter what they choose, they try to be consistent.  So that's what we do.  And we've *never* claimed not to make mistakes.  Moderation almost always means navigating a slippery slope.

As for our reputation, we do the best we can.  We're unpaid volunteers who have lives, families, jobs.  The sub has a wide variety of users, with a wide variety of experiences, expectations, and maturity levels, each of whom comes here for a different reason.  We try our best to meet everyone's expectations.  Unfortunately that means sometimes we'll make some users unhappy.  Our growth suggests that we're doing something right.  

But we always are willing to listen to suggestions--as long as they're not simply ad hominem attacks.  Helps, too, if they're made via mod mail, to ensure that we see them, and to help keep the sub on point.

	<TEXT> Automoderator removed it due to the sheer number of reports it generated--all generally due to complaints of circlejerking and karmawhoring.

That led us to review the high number of similar posts, all rejoicing over the same thing.  While that one was the most popular, it was hard to justify removing all but one, particularly as that one was not the first.  So we left it removed, removed the others, and set up this thread.

While we understand fans are excited, not everyone wants to have their feeds overwhelmed with variations of *yay Cowboys are in the playoffs*.

One of our jobs as mods is to ensure that feeds maintain their variety.  And there are plenty of other places on reddit which cater to karma-mongoring.

If we'd removed the others and reinstated that one, we would've been subject to criticisms about favoritism.  So we had 3 competing interests--no way to win.  And then we *still* would have been faced with the problem of removing future threads while leaving that one up.  Accordingly, we took the steps that seemed most consistent with our goal of maintaining quality content and which seemed most fair to all users.  

Understandable you might disagree, but there was at least reasoning behind it--and it had nothing to do with not being excited.

As a friendly suggestion, next time you have a question like this, maybe better to message the mods to be sure we see it.

Cheers.

	<TEXT> This story is from June 2016, as the article says at the beginning.  Unclear why the paper decided to run it again, as no updates were included.

In fact, [here's the update](http://archive.northjersey.com/news/education/boe-rules-on-students-gift-to-teacher-1.1676327), from October 2016: *The board ruled that the teacher could keep one of the tickets. But the students doing the fundraiser had to return the other one; Board President Betsy Ginsburg said that approach made the gift less extravagant.*

Board still isn't acting in line with its own policy. 

In any event, givers just need to ask the teacher who she'd invite and give the ticket to that person (who presumably isn't constrained by the policy). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In your early 20s....You must've been really small when your dad retired.  Still, it's an unusual perspective on life, and my guess is you may have some unique views.

I remember your father as a player; he gave everything he had on the field.  As long as you'd remember not to reveal too much personal information, why not?  

If your father wanted to do it, that would be fine, too. He'd just need to be advised that he can ignore anything he doesn't want to answer or which is inappropriate.

We've gotten zero support from the Cowboys, despite repeated attempts.  Our subbies are pretty educated about the team; he might find it fun.

But either would be fine.

Let us talk internally for a bit about how best to present it.  And somehow we'd need verification. Hm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dickerson was a terrific player--fast, big, strong.  He was the epitome of class, professionalism, and style.  

In terms of toughness, he was a little below Earl Campbell, who essentially was a mountain.  In terms of toughness, Campbell and Lawrence Taylor were men among boys.  But as Campbell can't walk now without help, over time I've come to believe that maybe it's good not to try to run people over all the time.  

In terms of speed and shiftiness, Dickerson was below Walter Payton and Barry Sanders.  But as a combination of those three, he couldn't have been much better.

Finally, as I recall he was an absolute blue chip coming out of college.  If he were to stay healthy, it was clear he was going to be a great one.  And he was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thing I noticed about the Vikings defense was how quick they were.  At least 2x they cause Elliott from behind.  Sure, he was behind the line of scrimmage and possibly hesitating, but that they got back there suggested they got around the line.  And, in any event, we've almost never seen that happen all year. </TEXT>

They get 16 tries to win, and every game matters.

I'll take a hard-fought game that's a win over a high-scoring game that's a loss every time.

Or perhaps you'd prefer a [48-51](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201310060dal.htm) shootout loss?

	<TEXT> Yep, yep, yep, and yep.  One of the many interesting things to me about being a Cowboys fan is seeing what guys do with the opportunities they're offered.  

No question that the NFL is a brutal game and that careers are short. Also no question though that the amount of money available can be astronomical--I mean, even a $1M contract is more than the average American will earn in 20 years.

So these guys have been working their entire lives to get to this point--but sometimes the baggage they bring with them is so heavy they can't finish the trip.  

Dez was able to do it; he stripped away all the mindset that was holding him back.  Sadly, like you say, Gregory can't.

It can become a celebration of the human spirit.   But also a mourning of the human condition. </TEXT>

If all goes well, surely the Cowboys will focus on the pass rush next year, right?  But in light of their record, not like they're going to have the best draft position.  

Still, as we've seen with Dak and maybe even Anthony Brown, where a guy is picked doesn't matter nearly as much as his willingness to learn and his motor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I would agree with this.  This is not just about the *tools* Dak has on offense.

This is about what Dak has brought to the offense--decision-making on par with the best QBs in the game, a calmness under pressure that seems to extend to his teammates, and a willingness to compete--all of which have gone with him apparently throughout his career.  Dak is contributing to the offense just as much as the OL, Zeke, Beasley, Witten, and Dez.  

He is the real deal.

Which isn't to say Wentz isn't.  But no one really can say how he'd be performing in this offense, because with him it would be a different offense. </TEXT>

But 3 years in, you know?  The equivalent of almost 2 full seasons.  And in that time he's averaging 4.8 sacks a season.  Pretty sure they expected more than that.

	<TEXT> As much as I hate to say it, DeMarcus Lawrence has not been what they envisioned when they drafted him in the 2d round.  Some of it is due to his injury in his first year, some to his suspension this year, some to the lack of lack of development due to his lost playing time, and some to the lack of performance by his teammates.  But 9 sacks in 30 games is disappointing.

Remember, he was scouted for the 2014 draft as having a first-round grade and being one of the best pass-rushing prospects in the draft.  Not saying the reasons haven't been valid, but he has not lived up to that.

That said, he did leave school early, and he's still young.  It would be nice to see him get through a training camp and play a full season.  So assuming he can do that next year, then we'll see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please don't judge me, but I've been a Cowboys fan a long time--longer than most redditors have been alive.  That said, over the past 20 years, they've been mediocre at best.  Their environment didn't change until Jerry Jones finally got out of his own way.  It's a complicated story, but in short he hired football guys and let them run football operations.

For the Browns ever to be successful again, Haslam will have to hire football guys and leave them alone.  He'll need to go out and get a good GM and then let the GM set up the organization.  And consistency matters.  4 coaches in 5 years is not the way to do it.  If Jerry can learn that he's his own worst enemy, anyone can.

I root for the Browns because I despise what Modell did, and I admire the pressure that Cleveland fans put on the NFL to regain a team.  As much as any NFL fans deserve success, its Browns fans.

All of that said, it's important to remember that fans have more in common with each other than they do with teams.  We're the ones out working and trying to make livings--we're the ones those players depend on for their livelihoods.  Kills me when fans are nasty to each other.  There's just no point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, there's probably a continuum which allows for fans of all types.  I understand why some fans might think *once a Cowboy, always a Cowboy*, and clearly emotions come into play, as sometimes a fan connects for some reason to a player's story.  There's nothing wrong with that.  

However, some fans only care about a guy as long as he's wearing the star.  Nothing wrong with that, either.

Conflict arises, maybe, when those 2 types of fans disagree with each other as to the nature of loyalty.  Both sides have valid perspectives.  

As a mod, I'd like to see a little more understanding from both sides, just to keep the peace in the family.  Not always so easy, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a slippery slope, and that's part of the problem; it's one of the many reasons we've resisted doing this.  Also, of course, I can't speak for mods of other subs.  What I *can* say is that if they complain to us, we'll review a user's history first to see if they're actually involved in our sub and then to see if they actually trolled the other sub.  Civil discussion of the game isn't trolling; pointing out that X player said Y isn't trolling; etc.  But if someone gets in there and in all caps starts going nuts, etc., getting personal, and so on--we all generally recognize trolling when we see it--then we'll act on it.

	<TEXT> We have run into situations involving users who attempt to dox mods, to attack mods with the release of personal information across multiple subs, including the posting of children's photos, names and addresses.  We have needed the cooperation of admins and mods to get these types of situations under control.  For obvious reasons I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about the communications that have occurred then.  

But any individual user's right to troll another subreddit pales in comparison to that.  I mean, it's not even a conversation.  But to ensure that mods get the cooperation they need, we have to get along.

The continuum runs all the way down simply to the level where other subbies are banned from other subs simply because they're Cowboys fans.

Thing to realize is that, like it or not, we represent each other.  Yeah, yeah, it's bullshit.  Except it's not.  When we receive a report from a mod, we examine the user's history to see if he's active in our sub; then we look for the reported conduct; then we evaluate whether it's objectionable; then we implement whatever ban.

But so if a user who's been active in our sub goes in and starts telling team X's fans, for instance, that they suck player X's childrens' dicks, we have a problem.  

Edit: just realized only the first half of this post really answers your question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from.  You've been on reddit a long time, and you've seen all kinds of things, just like a lot of the long-timers.  I see that you're looking at this from the perspective of an individual's expectations as to what he should be allowed to do online and the consequences of his behavior.
  
But there are ways to vent that have nothing to do with trampling on other people's expectations, violating expected rules of civility, or interfering with other people's relationships.  

And reddit is not just about an individual's efforts to communicate.  It's also about the people who own/run it and the people who volunteer to help.  We have considerations too.

This all boils down to what we're expected to do when other mods complain to us about the conduct of a few.  We do not believe that because a few people want to troll other subs Cowboys fans should face hostile environments in those subs.  And, like it or not, we do have to work with other mods.

This post is not a formality.  It's an attempt to discuss something we haven't particularly wanted to do.  And it's giving us a lot of feedback about ways we might implement this policy--which isn't one that we've rushed to follow, as apparently we're one of the last NFL subs to do it--and things to consider. </TEXT>

Realize: just because a mod tells us that X user was banned doesn't mean we're going to do the same.  Instead, we review the user's history and try to respond as appropriately as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To go with what SK says, so far we haven't hit any situations where we felt the need to contact other mods.  For us, removal and bans (if appropriate) have been fine.  

But we recognize that other mods may be more sensitive.  And it's not entirely their faults that they're not fans of the greatest football team ever.  So we cut them some slack.

Mainly for us what this is about is ensuring that we have cooperative relationships with other mods; a second benefit is encouraging civil, mature behavior.  Again, we're not reddit police.  But all of us probably recognize that some kinds of comments are less objectionable than others.  There is a continuum.  And at the far end of it, bans can be appropriate.

	<TEXT> That was our initial response--until we realized that makes it far more difficult for our subbies to encounter welcoming audiences in those subs.

Simplest solution: as a user, pretend that you're looking at the faces of the people you're talking to.

It's not grade school at all.  Society has expected rules of behavior.  And reddit has been around long enough for those rules to start to filter through.  In short, in life you're accountable for what you say.  Separate and apart from this policy, I don't see anything at all wrong with applying the same standard of accountability online. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We'll implement whatever type of ban we think appropriate.

Contrary to what some people seem to think, we're not power-hungry, and our personal lives actually are pretty good.  We don't ban users just because we can--it's not fair, and honestly it's not worth the aggravation.  In that regard, we're kind of like the police.  A ban creates extra work.  

That said, we are unpaid volunteers, and we all have jobs and families, and we will put up with grief and aggravation only to a certain point.  When any user becomes more trouble than he's worth, we stop sympathizing.

Also, another thing to remember is that sometimes bans are implemented simply to initiate dialogues, as some types of users won't respond otherwise, and for the most part we have no idea initially with which type of person we're dealing.

Also, just like you say, something to remember is that any user's response to a ban can have an impact on the length/severity of the ban.  For instance, if a user recognizes that what he did might have been out of line, we may go a lot easier than on someone who, for instance, as one troll did recently, told us to *go suck romo's dick, faggot*.

In short, we don't care what anyone does anywhere else.  But when/if a person becomes a problem for our relationship with another mod, we're going to care.

Or simply behave like an adult and this never should be an issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This appears to be a throwaway account, so I'm not sure you'll ever see this.  But I can hope I guess.  Ha!  I can have faith.

Anyway, the problem is that faith doesn't have to do with intellect.  You don't want a response based on Christian/catholic ideas, but the definition in the Bible, without getting all religious about it, is a pretty good one: *the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen*.  

Probably could spend years trying to understand that.

And notice it doesn't necessarily require a belief in religion.  It can be important to separate the idea of *religion*, defined as a conduct based on a belief, from the belief itself.

What I've found is that many religions fail because they don't account for so many aspects of our lives, or their adherents violate the tenets of their own beliefs by being judgmental/angry.

Faith doesn't seem to be about those things.  It seems to me to be rooted in humility, as it requires a confidence first in something other than ourselves, and second perhaps in something greater.

These days a lot of people have trouble believing in anything other than themselves, even while they screw up their lives in so many ways.  Even the things/people in which they purportedly do believe simply mirror their biases or serve as bases for confirmation bias.

But faith is something other than that.  Humility, yes.  Maybe trust, too.  Trust in your ability to perceive, but also trust in the quality of the other.

This might only have to do with God in the same sense that Arthur C. Clarke said, *"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."*  But to say that God is simply something/one we don't understand doesn't quite work, does it?  Because that suggests, like chaos theory, that given enough time/study we could understand God.  But who's to say we couldn't?

There's a great quotation, from The Thin Red Line, that I quote on Reddit all the time: *One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain. That death's got the final word, it's laughing at him. Another man sees that same bird, feels the glory, feels something smiling through it.*  

I am that second person.  Maybe it's just the glory of existence, I dunno.  But it's enough to give me faith.  In what I do not feel compelled to try to answer.  But it's enough. </TEXT>

Both books were heavily researched and are amazingly compelling reads: [Power of the Dog and The Cartel](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps field-keywords=power+of+the+dog). </TEXT>

The FCC isn't the cause of local monopoly laws; those are caused by embedded business interests which pay local/state governments to restrict choice.

Step 3 in that process seems not so intuitive to us!

The 300 * number above the radical + 30 * number above the radical * x + x^2 part.

Where's the 300 come from?  And why's it times the number above the radical?  And why the 30?  And the x + x (squared)?

Also, just wanted to say again that your explanation about long division was terrific!

	<TEXT> That's a great answer for long division!  Thank you. 

As for the development of the process, I found this explanation: *In a Greasham College lecture by Robin Wilson at Barnard's Inn Hall in London, he credited the invention of the modern long division process to Briggs, "The first Gresham Professor of Geometry, in early 1597, was Henry Briggs, who invented the method of long division that we all learnt at school"*  [here](http://pballew.blogspot.com/2013/10/division-some-notes-on-history-of.html).

The calculation of cube roots is another story.  The process is so unintuitive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I speak for the whole mod team in wishing every one of our subbies a happy Thanksgiving.  This year, with the team's success, we have a lot to be thankful for.  It's been a magical season so far, and no matter what happens the rest of the way, I'm guessing we'd all agree that it seems that, at long last, the Cowboys have changed the direction of their franchise.  Yay for them and yay for us!

Also, speaking personally, I am thankful to be a moderator of this sub.  The mods themselves are all terrific; each one brings something different to the mod team.  They are thoughtful, rabid fans, not just of the Cowboys, but also of all our subbies, and they work hard behind the scenes to keep the sub running optimally and to work as part of a team.  Thank you; you are each my mod brother.

I also feel thankful for our subbies.  You guys are awesome!  Fractious, insightful, cantankerous, funny, fanatical--you also, as I often say, are the most knowledgeable group of Cowboys fans I've ever found.  It has been a pleasure to talk with you, tease you, learn from/with you, and have my own mistakes noted (sometimes far too often (sigh)).  

Going forward, please, always let us know what you think via the [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcowboys) button.  We are very interested in your opinions and appreciate every opportunity to consider your ideas.

You make this sub special.  Thank you.

And again, happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Now let's root for the Cowboys to beat those stinkin' Redskins.  Redskins fans wanted the Cowboys?  Fine.  You got 'em!  Let this lesson fall under *be careful what you ask for*.  Go 'Pokes! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In no particular order:  
  
1) I read to them every night of their lives while they were small.  
2) I told them stories after reading to them every night of their lives when they were small.  
3) I stayed with them until they fell asleep every night of their lives when they were small.  
4) Their first Broadway show.  
5) Their sibling is their best friend.  
  
6) I carried them everywhere as often as I could until they finally got too big for me to do it.  
7) I always had time for them.  
8) No question was ever too silly or unimportant.  
9) In fact, the sillier the question the better.  
10) I loved nothing better than snuggling with them.  
    
11) They were gifts to me for not giving up after [my difficult early life](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rr0bl/im_not_really_sure_if_i_should_ask_this_question/c47zg09).  
12) Every single day as their dad has been a gift and better than the one before.  
13) Their mother changed my life for the better.  
14) Being smart only gets you into the waiting room. Being smart and working hard gets you into the room with the toys.  
15) We are lucky in all that we have.  
  
16) We are the universe expressing itself as people.  
17) I love them with all my heart.  
18) I am lucky to be their dad.  
19) Play is important.  
20) Achievement is important.  
  
21) Working hard and doing your best is important.  
22) If you're going to do something you might as well do it right.  
23) I always had glue and tape.  
24) I always had bandaids and soft words for boo-boos.  
25) Hugs and kisses were the best kinds of money. 
  
26) Share with the same generosity that's been shown to you.  
27) I am a master tickler.  
28) Doing it matters more than just saying you'll do it.  
29) Watch how we (parents) behave and practice that.  
30) It's not whether you make a mistake that matters--we all make mistakes.  It's what you do once you have that defines a person.

31) I've written letters to their future selves on every birthday, to be delivered upon my death or when they turn 18, whichever comes first.  (I'm rooting for the latter).  
32) I expect them to listen.  (Note: I don't mean to obey, but to hear, the same way I listen to them.)  
33) I only give orders when they are necessary.
  
I'll add more as I think of them. </TEXT>

I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  Not a false step in it.  Tense, scary, extremely stylishly done.  Anyone who liked It Follows or The Babadook (i.e., almost everyone) will love this.  

You guys have something to look forward to, seriously.

	<TEXT> [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/580uou/romo_or_dak_please_post_all_linkstextsmemes_etc/) replaced so subbies won't have to worry about contributions being lost in the flood.  We'll keep doing this until the issue subsides.

As with the first thread, all posts on this topic which are made outside this thread will be removed and may subject the subby to a ban. Keep it here!

NOTE: a third version will be going up after the Eagles game.  Let's hope we need it because it'll mean Dak played well! </TEXT>

Edit: THIS POST WILL BE REMOVED/REPLACED WITH A NEW MEGA THREAD ON SATURDAY OCT 21.
