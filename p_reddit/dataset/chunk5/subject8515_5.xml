	<TEXT> No-Man's Wharf bugged the ever-living shit out of me. It was the third area I went to and it kicked my ass something fierce. It's actually not bad as far as level design goes, but the enemy placement is absolutely ridiculous for a level so early in the game. Granted, I had unwittingly joined the Company of Champions with no clue of what it did, so that probably didn't help... but it felt so good to finally get past that godforsaken area. At least the boss is easy and there's a shortcut so you can just run to him.

A few tips:

-It's worth it to use the Pharros Lockstone on the second floor. It adds a lot of much-needed lighting to the area and forces the Darkstalkers into the houses, making later parts of the level much more manageable.

-Speaking of which, if you're doing a Strength build, it's worth your time to explore the uppermost house full of Darkstalkers as one of the chests at the top holds a Greatsword, a very good PvE weapon.

-Be sure to kick down the bridge for the shortcut toward the end of the area. If you're not worried about collecting everything, you can just run all the way through the level without killing anything. Be sure to run semi-unpredictably, as the archers often shoot in anticipation of where you *will* be and running in a straight line pretty much guarantees you'll get hit.

That's all I got. Good luck and I hope you have as much fun never going back to No-Man's Wharf as I did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this exact thing a couple nights ago! First playthrough of Dark Souls, finally beating Ornstein and Smough after hours of trying. The surge of satisfaction was fucking unbelievable.

I'm about halfway between that and the end of the game, and so far, nothing has even come close to being as hard. Four Kings was obnoxious as hell but mostly because I hate the aesthetic of New Londo Ruins and I got sick of running through it over and over. The fight itself wasn't too bad once I got used to it. Good luck on the rest of your journey! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Entirely melee, SL 54 with most points in Strength and a fair few in Dexterity. I had been using a Battle Axe+10 for the whole game up to that point, but it wasn't doing enough damage, so I ended up going all the way back to Undead Parish to ascend my Zweihander. Got it to +10 and five two-handed hits with that bad boy was enough to kill Ornstein in the first phase. Smough got stuck behind a pillar on the last three hits, so that wasn't too bad. Then it was just a matter of being lucky enough for Pika-Smough not to do his electricity butt-stomp or charge attack too many times (because I suck at dodging those). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a fair point. I guess what I meant is that any single item you see only has a 1/250 chance of being Mega Blast. And the chance increases the more items you pick up, yes, but that 1/5 makes the difference pretty negligible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you tried the Eden method? It's a lot more effective than fighting your way to devil deals over and over. To be precise:

Mega Blast is 1/5 as likely to spawn as any other devil room item, and there are 50 devil room items total, so that's only a 1 in 250 chance of seeing it appear any time you enter a devil room (assuming you don't get Krampus).

On the contrary, there are 87 active items in the game, and Eden always starts with one. Mega Blast is just as likely as any of the others. So the trick is to restart with Eden over and over until Mega appears. If you've played the game this far, chances are you have more than 87 Eden tokens, so the odds should be in your favor.

That's how I finished 1001%. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help! Trying to play without Afterbirth and game won't launch! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-22 22:24:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> EDIT: I figured it out. Turns out the mods I had installed didn't delete themselves when I reinstalled--removed those and the game is working again. I'll just leave this here in case somebody else has the same problem in the future.

-

I've played the hell out of Afterbirth and enjoyed it very much, but I'm out of things to do (1001% on all save files and I've had my fill of Eden streaks). I want to go back to the original Rebirth for a while before AB+ comes out since I never did get Real Platinum God.

But here's the problem: I've unchecked the Afterbirth DLC to uninstall it, and now the game won't run. The "Binding of Isaac Rebirth" window opens for a brief moment before going white and producing the error message "isaac-ng.exe has stopped working." The game works again if I reinstall Afterbirth, but I can't get it to work without it.

Things I've tried that didn't solve the problem:

-Deleting all local files and reinstalling without Afterbirth checked

-Verifying integrity of game cache, before and after reinstalling (the error message takes longer to come up when I do this but otherwise nothing changes)

-Restarting Steam

-Manually backing up and then deleting the files in *C:/Users/XXX/My Documents/My Games/Binding of Isaac Rebirth* before launching, as suggested by loads of people when Rebirth first came out in 2014

Playing on a Windows 10 laptop that far exceeds the recommended system requirements.

Problem is, I hate the direction they've taken with Capaldi's Doctor; I loved the dark humor in "The Caretaker" because it suited him so perfectly, but in what I saw of series 9 I felt like they had done some major backpedaling and tried to force Matt Smith comedy into his persona. </TEXT>
