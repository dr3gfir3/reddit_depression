	<TEXT> I've noticed that he tends to judge an actor's performance by their off-screen activities.  His dismissiveness of K Stew was one element, but what really made me realize it was his review of Gone Girl, how he dedicated like five minutes of his review making fun of Tyler Perry and the movies he makes.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a huge fan of Tyler Perry either, but his performance in the film was actually really good.  He personified that charming television personality with the knowings of how the game worked underneath...  It worked really well.  But in Adam's review, it's like, "Hey, Tyler Perry is shit right?  How weird was it that he was in this movie?  Let me ramble about that for a bit." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been thinking about this a lot lately.  FFG is missing a great opportunity of people who want to play as Imperial or Evil characters.  Right now, it seems like people have to work it our narratively if they want to play as the bad guys, but I would love some mechanics added to allow for Evil Campaign plays!

There's a lot that could be added!  Players could play as Imperial Double Agents, perhaps a specialized Stormtrooper Squad made famous in the most recent comics, Commanders of ISDs, Sith Apprentices, Inquisitors...  I think there's a lot of possibility here. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Doing Mount Fuji and Aoikgahara Forest in two days. Looking for some information. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-01 16:14:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys,

So, a friend and I are planning to climb Mt. Fuji and explore the infamous Aokigahara Forest in two days on our two week vacation.  Our vacation is planned for early September, so we know it's gonna be cold.  We have a few questions in relation to getting there, getting to Aokigahara and then getting back.

1. The schedule for the buses at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo were very vague.  I think we're under the impression that you take a bus as early as 9:30, and then get to 5th Station.  But I've seen videos, like Abroad in Japan, that seem to show buses taking off at a later time.  Could we get clarification on that by any specific link?  

2. We reserved two spaces at the Mountain Hut at 3,400 meters, but I've just learned how expensive it is and we may choose to forego that option.  If so, what options do we have besides sleeping outside?  Are there little spaces to hang out, eat, drink, and maybe not freeze to death?

3. After we do the mountain, we want to climb down and make a trip to Aokigahara Forest since we are in the area.  Now, the impression we got is that we make our way back to Kawaguchiko station, which we assume the buses go back from the station we climb down at, and then take something called a 'Retro Bus' towards a Station by a bat cave.  Can we take the Retro Bus back?  Has anyone done this as well, and what did you do similar?

4. And just to clarify, we are under the impression that taking a train to Hiroshima, using the JR pass, from Kawaguchiko Station is impossible.  It seemed to us that it'd cost less just to take the bus back to Tokyo and start on the train from there, but we wanted to clarify.

Thanks for any help, and I'd appreciate any tips for exploring these two parts of the Fuji area. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've frankly just started it, but it seems like their focus is more on Murderers.  The last two episodes I listened to were some of the most recent releases, and one was about two different cases of women killing their family.  That was very disturbing, because they played the panicked phone calls of the family begging not to be killed.  The other was a story about a woman in Japan named Junko Futura.  If you've read American Psycho, that's what you're in for with her story.

It's audio murder porn basically.  Like what you'd see on TV with Deadly Women or something similar... </TEXT>

You can get three pounds of chicken for under ten, and the others shouldn't rack up the cash either.  Limit yourself to 2-3 tacos a day, and you literally have a week+ meal to draw from.  It has been pretty rad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really want to like Pokemon Go.  Hell, I'm the type of person who would benefit most from it!  I walk 5-6 miles a day for work, and sometimes podcasts or audiobooks just don't do it...  But even with my long walks, Pokemon Go is a broken catastrophe.  I distinctly remember walking home, just TRYING to play this game, and having it freeze up or crash with every attempt to catch a Pokemon or take a gym.  And to add insult to injury, it works for the ratatas and pidgys, but when a rare pokemon pops up...  THAT'S when it freezes.  It seriously turned me off to the whole experience, and I still get very frustrated, just giving it one more go...  Only to have the same problems consistently halt my progress.  

I think I hate this game.  Not what it represents, or the technology it's pushing forward.  All of that sounds great and new and interesting!  But the unintentional negative feedback loop attributed to how mind-numbingly broken this game just makes the whole affair seem fruitless and pointless.  Play Ingress instead.

If you're really wondering if you should get this game, I highly recommend waiting.  My problems have seriously skewed my opinion of the game, and now I am biased against it.  If you wait 6 months, you might get a betterb experience!  But I doubt I am going to be playing this game anytime soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want to read a tragic story, read this woman's diary entries:

Shanina's personal life was thwarted by war. On 10 October 1944, she wrote in her diary, "I can't accept that Misha Panarin doesn't live anymore. What a good guy! [He] has been killed ... He loved me, I know, and I him ... My heart is heavy, I'm twenty, but I have no close [male] friend". In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she "is flogging into her head that [she] loves" a man named Nikolai, although he "doesn't shine in upbringing and education". In the same entry she wrote that she did not think about marriage because "it's not the time now". She later wrote that she "had it out" with Nikolai and "wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one'". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she "cannot find a solace" now and is "of no use to anyone". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Age: 27

Sex: Male

Weight: 260 lbs

Height: 6'1

Race: White

Duration: A few years now...

Location: Night time, when I'm trying to sleep in my bed.

Existing Issues: Allergies, frequent urination at times...

Current Medications: Vitamins I take in the morning.

Will provide a pic if necessary.

Can anyone tell me what this is? It usually happens when I am in bed, unable to sleep. I usually sleep on my side, and I'll sometimes open my eyes to the white walls to the left or right of me.

When I do, I'll see a shadow of a large spider. It looks like a tarantula, but the legs are sharp like a black widow. It used to make me jump, but now I've gotten so used to it I just watch them for the few seconds they exist before they disappear.  It's usually only one Spider, directly in the center of my vision.

The hallucinations only last a few seconds. It feels like the same sensation you get when you press on your closed eyes and see lights. I know they aren't real, so I feel like they aren't effecting me psychologically. But it's so weird that I was wondering if there was a name for this weird thing that happens? </TEXT>

I was thinking of how awesome a HITMAN game would be with this format.  You walk around a GPS representation of your surroundings, find objects in the world like you do with random pokemon.  You can kill targets with the camera like you would the AR part of Pokemon Go, or snipe other Hitmen who are playing the game, based on their google picture.  

Strongholds/Safe Houses can work as the Gyms, and people can start claiming territory like they would a Mafia game or something.

I think he's funny a lot of the time, but I honestly can't see how anyone could listen to him ramble about sports, sexism, whatever for hours like people do with his podcast...  I tried to listen to an episode, and it was just him bitching for an hour.  It felt very high school.

I think he's a great comedian, and him telling Philly to go eat a bag of dicks was one of the greatest comedy moments in this generation, but yeah...  He can shut the fuck up sometimes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Utopia...

I'm the rare American fan, and the entire series ended with one of the main characters turning evil and taking over The Syndicate, all our main characters captured by syndicate, and the anti-hero awaking from his coma...

God, I am so upset it was cancelled. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Possible Spoilers]What are some single shots that ruined or damaged your experience of a movie? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Ruined is a strong word, bit I remember one of the final shots of Unbreakable really pissed me off.  The shot I'm referring to is when David is walking away from Mr. Glass after discovering it was him who was responsible for numerous terrorist attacks, including the train crash David was a part of...  As he's walking away, the picture freeze frames and details the epilogue as following: 

"David Dunn led authrorites to Limited Edition where evidence of three acts of terrorism was found."

"Elijah Price is now in an institution for the criminally insane."

These two shots, one after the other, nearly ruined the entire film for me.  They were so out of place and unneeded.  They implied that the events of the film actually happened...  I know M. Night gets a lot of shit for his newer releases, but these added shots completely baffle me.  How could he think adding them was a good idea?

Another example if my friend who claims he is taken out of the experience of Star Wars by the Stormtrooper who bumps his head on the raising door in A New Hope, but I find that one a bit over doing it...

What shots ruined films for you /r/movies? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fucking hate Eraserhead.

I get what it was, I understand how this was a film that pioneered modern surrealism in film, and how it elevated David Lynch to a director to absolutely care about and watch, and how it was a fantastically done with prosthetics and filming, and how the tone and atmosphere is completely drenched in a horrific vibe that unnerves you and makes you eye everything with your own interpretation...

But that doesn't stop it from being one of the most miserable 88 Minutes of my life.  I will never watch this movie again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so glad NakeyJakey is getting more traction on /r/games.  He has a Dunkey level of 'reviewing and critiquing games,' but he puts a lot of effort into his videos, and even his rap reviews have solid criticism in them.

That said, he has the same issues with GTA V.  For an open world game, none of the missions are free form.  I think in one of his 'games that should bang' series, he stated he wished for the mission structure of MGSV over what GTA V offers, which I agree with. </TEXT>
