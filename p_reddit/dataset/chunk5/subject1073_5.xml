	<TEXT> That's true.  Unfortunately, we had a choice between a candidate who wanted to "tweak" a system that needs fundamental improvement and a con artist who promised to cover everyone with better insurance for less money while reducing the deficit.

Who won? </TEXT>

Let's not remake Hillary's extremely pro-Wall Street centrist campaign into some great progressive movement it never was.  She would have been better than this insane shit-show, but she wouldn't have been good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you'll give more credit to political hacks with degrees because they allow you to justify your fear of others, ignorance, and gut feelings.

If you actually put medical expertise before your desire to punish those who don't act as you demand, you'd listen to the vast majority of medical doctors who denounce this fringe group of morons. </TEXT>

Is your need to control the identities of others so strong that it causes you mental anguish when they don't conform to your expectations?  If so, you might have an entirely different mental impairment. </TEXT>

I will mock and criticize her bat-shit crazy beliefs and her willingness to lie and deceive her followers to push a hate-filled agenda.

	<TEXT> Gee, let's frame the discussion in a way that absolutely makes the other side the bad guy without any context.  

Let's not talk about the corporations who provide incentives for these people to come here. 

Let's not talk about the fact that their ancestors lived here long before Europeans stole their land and pushed them out or slaughtered them.

Let's not talk about the policies the US has pushed to crush governments that seek to empower people in Central and South America.

Let's just call them criminals and talk about how to punish them. /s </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And Brietbart isn't the "Right."  It's a tool to manipulate low information voters so that corrupt corporations can rape the country while mouth-breathers scream about abortion and welfare.

Likewise, Brock is a tool being used to do the same thing from the other side.  

So long as these greedy, power-hungry assholes can keep us fighting over gay rights, abortion, welfare, and guns, they go about their business of stealing our future without much worry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought this was going to be a smear piece until I saw that it was about David Brock.  He really is the "Brietbart of the Left," only far less successful.

As we saw in the primaries, Brock has no attachment to the truth or decency at all.  He will make up any lie and do dirty deed in order to manipulate low information voters.  

I want to win elections, but doing it Brock's way will not give us a progressive president who is looking out for our values, but instead a "Trump of the Left" who will throw us a few social values bones while giving our futures away to corporations and personal corruption.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you think that was clever as you wrote it?  I'm sure you're regretting typing out something as stupid as that now, so I was wondering.

On the off chance you actually believe what you wrote, please look into things before simply calling people names and spewing bullshit as fact.  I know the con-artist in the White House seems to be getting away with it at the moment, but you aren't him and will only continue to look foolish. </TEXT>

But if you want to be known as a racist fascist, I'm not going to argue with you.  In fact, I'll wholeheartedly agree with your own assessment. </TEXT>
