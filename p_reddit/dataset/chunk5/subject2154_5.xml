	<TEXT> Our son was interested in joining the scouts a few years ago as well.  I was a cubscout/boyscout when I was a kid so I had many of the same feelings and see the value in many of things they teach.

At the time, I explained to my son my concerns and he agreed it was not fair that some people would be excluded based on sexual preference (although it has since changed to some degree as OP noted).

One thing I have been considering, as there is no alternative in our area, is to purchase a Boy Scout manual and then teach my son and daughters, many of those valuable skills on my own.  It would be a great way for us to spend time as a family and an opportunity for them to learn skills they don't get much exposure to.  

Best of luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I had a friend in town so I only caught the last 12 minutes or so but I thought they looked to be playing more as a team and I really love the chemistry.  They could have shut down Miami a few times and allowed them to come back, like 3 unanswered 3 pointers.  If they clean that sort of stuff up I think they could be very competitive.

It's exciting and I'm happy for our University. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This thread is no different than the guy who was "listening to that band way before they were popular".   I hate that guy!

Look, a lot of of us have been looking forward to this games release and put our money up to play it a long time ago but I haven't kept track of the developers favorite yogurt flavor or what time they drink their tea.  I saw a potentially great game and pledge my money to show my support.  I kept my eye on it at a distance but I wasn't glued to every detail and its silly to point out others who haven't.

Instead, lets celebrate the amount of admiration and excitement that this game is receiving and from what I've seen it is well deserved.  What great day, I'm looking forward to playing this weekend! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> what is nearly complete?  What if my friend gets 70% complete and gets a refund but I do 75% and not.

what determines the completion rate?  What if I push through the game but dont do any side quests?  It may only show 25% total progress but someone with OCD only gets to level 2 but shows 50% complete

I get what you are saying but its too subjective to work IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this is just how shitty "fans" of anything are getting.  Game developers get death threats when they patch a game and it breaks something unintentionally.  

Attacking these student athletes who are playing a game is about as low as it gets.  I'm sure these same assholes are the ones going to little league games and screaming at the umpire.  

I went to THE University of Nebraska in the 90's when we won 3 national championships.  I know how incredible winning can be.  However, I don't have a meltdown and lock myself in my room when we have a bad game.  BUT I assure you, anytime a Husker fumbles (which is often), there are 10 assclowns tweeting that player and telling him he sucks.  We had a potentially great quarterback but he got ridiculed for 4 years for the way he threw the ball.  That kid busted his ass for our university and took hits that would make me shit my pants.  He played injured, hobbled and never complained.  He deserved our thanks but he was asked endlessly about this throwing motion, it was analyzed in slow mo video on ESPN and Big 10 network and then when he made mistakes, the freaks would come out of the wood work (myself excluded) and tweet to him or rant on message boards.  I don't know how these kids can do it.

Our coach had a mega meltdown on Friday and I would too.  The expectations should always be high but when you get a 24/7 media breathing down the neck of a 19 year old kid and anytime he makes the slightest mistake, you have a bunch of grumpy old codgers personally attacking them, I'd unleash the Kracken myself.

I'm so disgusted with "fans" this year....it may have always been like this but it seems worse this year, all around, for any team.

Good luck to this kid, he doesn't deserve any of this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's a good kid, did everything that was asked of him and beyond.  He was never in trouble, good student, lot of charity work.  He just wasn't hip enough for the media at times and he fell into that trap of trying to do too much when we fell behind and I think he just couldn't over come the injuries that have added up.  

The first half of his freshman season were pretty incredible.  Go back and watch some highlights, pretty awesome stuff.  Here are the highlights from the OK State game ( [LINK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPF2qDw45k4) ).  

Edit - Here is the K-State game, which was my favorite that year.  (  [LINK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVI64Yih2Ug).

It's like how they always wait for Bo to start yelling on the sidelines but when you watch any other football game, the other coaches are just as upset and animated but its brushed off.  Lazy "journalism".

I was scared about being shot at by men in pickups and living in a hut but on the bright side I could have a pet monkey.  That was literally my thought process...ever the optimist.

	<TEXT> It's quite daunting but once you whittle it down, its not too terrible.

* do parent only
* remove casino type games, can't remember what they were called (those whacky Japanese games).
* remove games that require controls you don't have on your cabinet

I just sort of narrowed it down like that, I'm sure there were more things to remove.  I even think there is a Video with recommendations on Don's site.

In addition to that, I purchased a sub to EmuMovies and then used that to get to my final list.  It took a number of hours but I was happy with the results. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have said...

I love our game and our company so much, that it allowed me to overreact to negative comments.  This was wrong and I am incredibly sorry.

Our company has made major mistakes and we are working to overcome those.  You all have every right to be mad and frustrated and we should  allow you to vent those frustrations, especially on a site such as Reddit.  

If you will allow me, I want to spend everyday moving forward trying to re-earn your respect.  I want to show you the exciting things we have in the pipeline and I want to prove to you that although we are very late on delivering this product, that it was well worth the time and your investment.

My job as a community manager is not to police our users, it is to represent our company in a positive light and give you a reason to be excited for Castle Story.  

I have failed to do that and for that I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies.

As you can see I am married so I've had to apologize a lot in my life. :) 

As stated before, I haven't posted on here or the forums.  I am disappointed at the delays and all the other drama going on but I haven't said a word.  I was in indie development at one point at the turn of the century.  I know how frustrating it can be.  Our team was doing it in our spare time with zero budget and no time line or schedule and we still had people riding our ass every day about updates for a game we hadn't even released or sold.  We had never done anything other than Map Packs for various games so we were also learning on the fly.  It became too much for some and they moved on to greater things.  This is why I'd never get after a dev for a delayed game.

I do get upset when people who are rightfully upset get banned on Reddit by the game devs.  This is the only reason I spoke up.  You took someone who wasn't mad and gave me a reason to be.  It was a dumb dumb move but its now over.    This is a defining moment, in my opinion.  Don't walk away with your head down or frustrated with the community.  Go ...*they are right, we need to make this fun and exciting again*... then set out a way to do that.

We all want you to succeed and I am certainly rooting you on.  Give us a reason to spread the word.  Remember, winning cures everything.

Best of luck to you and your team.

	<TEXT> I am a kickstarter backer of this game and while I subscribed to this subreddit some time ago, I've never once posted.

I have certainly been disappointed in the progress of this project but as someone who was involved in Indie development ages ago, I can appreciate the challenges it can present.

However, this is a clear example of not only completely blowing it with the community that supported the project, it is also an example of how not to fix things when you screw up.  

The smarmy half apology is unfortunate and the little faith I had left in your company is now gone.

The only thing I would agree with is you screwed up.  I do it constantly, all the time, endlessly.  Honest screw ups should be expected but we are measured by how we respond to those screw ups.  Your "apology" or explanation or whatever it is, comes across as a defense for acting like a fool and your subsequent comments are smarmy and are not mending fences.  

You shouldn't consider, not being a jerk as "Unknown Territory".  This is really common sense but here are some big tips for you, since you need it.

* We are your investors.  Consider this first before you comment or react.  We believed in your company and gave you money to show just how much. 

* We are probably the best marketing tools at your disposal.  Treat us as such and give us a reason to want to share our experience with your game.

* If you don't have anything nice to say....DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

* This is our community, not Sauropod's.

As an example of HOW to do things, I purchased an indie game for $15 about 2 years ago.  It was in alpha and certainly not perfect.  That developer created a community that we wanted to support, that we cheered on and made me want to talk about all the time.  They treated their community with respect, responded to critics with respect and communicated often.

That game finally launched on Steam a few weeks back and after all this time, they have a great solid product, a large community that is growing and a game I still play all the time, 2 years later.

You can do that here.  This is that defining moment.  Say I am sorry, I really screwed up and there is no reason for it.  Remove yourself totally as a mod, of any kind, and work to rebuild these relationships and build a fun exciting community.  People were already mad and frustrated, rightfully so...your moderation made it much much worse.  

Don't make excuses.  Don't be defensive.  You screwed up...that is acceptable.  The response...could be better.  Don't be a white knight.

As long as I see SauropodBox listed as an admin, I have zero faith that things are salvageable.

Best of luck to you and your company.  I hope you are able to turn things around. </TEXT>

Fans are different.  I'm sure yours are like ours...1/3 think you will win by 20 points, 1/3 think it will be a close battle and it could go either way and the final 1/3 think your team will shit the bed.

	<TEXT> You can measure angles in Sketchup.  For myself, I used a table saw to cut that angle but as stated by Button-Masher you can cut angles with  circular saws as well.  Even my jig-saw allows me to cut at an angle so there are options.

When the control panel meets the bezel, its another angle to cut to make it flush or you can use some sort of a metal bracket that could be bent to fit the angle.  it could be similar to what you will use for the marquee.

I went through all of this when I built mine too.  You may need consider what tools you have when you design your cabinet.  Don't design what you can't produce. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we all can agree that Pi is great with a big scoop of ice cream.

I kid I kid...I've used my pi as a nes/snes emulator for my kids and it worked great.  I utilized a powered usb hub and 2 xbox controllers that we had.

I would like to build a single player bartop with only a few select "classic" games for my father-in-law and I do want to test it as an option.  I think in that instance it would be viable.  If not, I have an old laptop that I could use.  

I would agree that if you want to use a Pi, to have reasonable expectations on what you will be able to play and some of the challenges it will present.  I would also agree that a desktop pc will give you more options and flexibility and is the better way to go.

Good post, always do a ton of research before spending any money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem was only when using *any* front end and when I changed the game selection and the new video preview played, it would flicker, like if you changed the channel, S-VIDEO would come up in giant green letters..  If there were no videos, no flicker.  My understanding is that it was a problem with refresh rate but no matter what third party app I used to adjust that, no change in behavior.  I had spent SO much time on configuring the front ends and the extra cost for emumovies, I just could t abandon that work to use a different front end or no videos.  I didn't really have a chance to think about your suggestion since I first read it.  Your recommendation had to do with mame and all the games work fine, looked glorious.

I certainly could have "lived with it" but I figure I can work out the bugs on the side and the family/friends still have something to enjoy until then.

I saw a few other AGP cards on various sites and ebay.  I think I might still have a few more hiding around here somewhere.  In a worst case scenario, I am going to be upgrading my main pc here in the next 3-4 months.  I thought about testing it with my current rig and if it resolves it, waiting until then and using that hardware.  

I appreciate you taking all this time to consider my issue and offer suggestions.  It means a lot that you would do that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you the thumbs up on the design and great question.  The challenging part (to me) about building one of these was, you will find STRONG varied opinions on every single thing.  With regards to this, ultimately, my Double Dragon has glass and I like that i can pull that out and clean it and it looks new.  On a few cabs I've seen around, with the plexi, it has tiny scratches and doesn't look quite as good. That doesn't mean that would be the case here, but it was what I considered when weighing options.  

I have 3 kids who will touch the "screen" so I thought it would be the best way to go.  For the cost, it's only about $15, I think the plexi was comparable so if I decide I don't like it, I can change it.  I was also on the fence about tinting.  I decide against it b/c some felt it diminished the colors and I will rarely play "in the dark".  Again, for the price, I can get that later as well.  The nice thing about these is nothing is set in stone, I can always change some aspects if I don't like it later on.  It's a learning process with 200 miles of wiggle room. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did it to save space on each side and the back.  The back was 8" deeper with the case, 12" total for the sides and I believe about 6" on the top.  I couldn't meet my size requirements otherwise.

I would have also been able to build my own bezel to clean up the look...the case was silver...I was also hoping to rewire the power/input button as well.

You don't have to do that and I have seen many folks just set it in there and build with it in mind, or paint the existing bezel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would consider myself a novice as well.  I had never built one and I'm sure if I did another it would turn out better, of course, but there is so much to know and learn, it's what makes it attractive.

I'll try to answer your questions the best I can.

* MDF is the type of wood I used, 3/4".  It is extremely dusty.  It basically turns into a very fine powder and will get everywhere.  Cut as much as you can outside.  

* the paint wasn't too much of a problem.  I applied a 50/50 mixture of glue and water to the cabinet first, as my sealer and sanded it a ton.  I painted it with a roller, then sanded anything that I had concerns about. Then painted again.  The side art material can bring out the flaws more than paint so keep that in mind. 

* Screws, I dont remember.  I believe they were 1 1/4" in length, wood screws.  The biggest mistake I made here is I put the screws in from the outside.  At the time it made sense, I was worried about them screws coming through the other side.  In reality that wouldn't have happened and I had to fill in and sand dozens up dozens of holes.

* I believe this is the light I used [LINK](http://www.menards.com/main/lighting-fans/indoor-lights/accent-lights/fluorescent-20-white-undercabinet-bar/p-1779157-c-6349.htm).  I think it looks great, very similar to my original arcades.

* I did not countersink the joysticks.  I mounted them underneath and they are just like my Double Dragon ones.

Tips??

*  Plan, plan and then plan.  Buy some cardboard and build the design to make sure you will like it and it will fit. 

*  Think forward....future proof the system as much as you can.  Make it easy to add/remove components down the line.

*  Don't order the T-Molding until you are nearly complete.  I underestimated and had a strip that wasn't quite long enough, so I had to order more.  The min order was 20ft so I have two strips of left over I can't use.

* The one question I always wanted to ask on Reddit before my build (but I didnt) was, what was one thing you wish you knew before you started?  Now that I am done and can answer that.  The build will be harder and take longer than you expect.  Assume you will go over budget and plan for it.  Realize there is so much to know that you will overlook something and/or make a mistake...that is ok and part of the fun. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I built a Mame cabinet from scratch for my son's 10th Birthday.  We had the party last Saturday and it was a big hit.

* Here is a small imgur album:  [LINK](https://imgur.com/a/DQ9Zl).
* I wrote small blog on the project if you want to see more images: [LINK](http://myarcadium.blogspot.com/).

A few items to note.  I originally started out with a 27" tv and it looked great!!  However, late in the process I ran into problems with it.  With little time left, I used a 4:3 LCD I had but that's something that can be upgraded later.  Second, I purchased a pane of glass to cover the bezel. It is too snug of a fit so I will need to get a little bit trimmed off before I can properly install it.  It felt as if the paint was going to get scratched OR the glass might crack.  Not worth it obviously.

I wanted to post this here as well b/c this is the subreddit where I rekindled my love and appreciation for the original arcade machines.  I had no idea I could buy them for a reasonable price until I stumbled upon this place.  I now have an awesome Double Dragon that works perfect and an Outrun I'm still restoring.  I plan to continue purchasing and restoring original cabinets but I thought this was a great way to expose my kids to some incredible games we simply don't see around our parts.  They think an Arcade is a place to win tickets to trade for plastic toys.

Thank you all! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> with my j-pac, I had several buttons with the same keycode.  It took me a bit to understand the reprogramming but once I "got it" it was easy.  I am not sure if the i-pac is the same as a j-pac but here is what I did.

* connect the ps/2 keyboard into the passthrough port on the j-pac
* note what keys share the same keycode and any others you want to change. Also note what is available to use as replacement keys
* open notepad, press cntrl/alt/p (this will be where the built in progamming "displays" its text)
* press a button, then press the replacement keyboard button
* once done, press e (I think)

This took me a bit to figure out, I don't feel the instructions were clear but I am also a slow, small brained moron.  :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, to add one final thing.  Another thing you can do is use Sketchup.  They have a free version of their 3D program and if you google "sketchup insert favorite cab name model" you will likely find a free available 3d model that you can use to help with your final design.  I based mine off of a Double Dragon cabinet but when it changed to a 4 player cab, I expanded my existing design and then looked at the TMNT cabinet for some good control panel dimensions.

* [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/)

---edit

I was curious if I had misread the Diabetes thing but here is something from a recent [article](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/09/tom-hanks-type-2-diabetes):

"The actor  who lost 13kg (two stone) for Philadelphia and 25kg for Castaway, and gained 13kg for A League of Their Own  said that "may have had something to do" with his having type 2 diabetes, "because you eat so much bad food and you don't get any exercise when you're heavy".

But Hanks said he had had the symptoms for 20 years. "I think I was genetically inclined to get it and I think it goes back to a lifestyle I've been leading since I was probably seven, as opposed to 36."" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watched a big chunk of the game and the only thing I was left wondering, why did they take out Kain when they got to the red zone...he'd get them there and then ole Passy McPasserson would come in and the defense would just full out blitz him.  I think some of the offense calls were questionable but what do I know.

Overall I was really impressed with Northwestern.  On TV, they often looked half the size of their counterparts but I could tell they wanted to win more than the other team and no one was going to get in their way.  They looked prepared, they were mentally and physically tough and they are going to be a very hard team for the rest of us in this division to beat.

They'll bounce back and play great....just need to get those Alums to show up to the games and support a great program.
