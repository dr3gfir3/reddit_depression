	<TEXT> Didn't effect me. I'm a black female. I literally never gave two shits about the race or gender of my super heros. 

I still played like I was a ninja turtles even tho they were all dudes. I still was trying to be wolverine even tho he was a white dude. I was never a fan of storm. 

The closest I came to caring was when they had Ryan Reynolds play the green lantern. But that was more of a I grew up with Green Lantern being a black guy so I thought he was supposed to be a black guy.  </TEXT>

I liked Jem not cus she was a chick but because same name situation. If anything, I was always very meh about supers that looked like me. I wasn't a big fan of storm. 

I care more about back story. 

I get Batman cuz we're both orphans. 
I get other super heroes because their stories get to me. 

Race and gender are cheap tricks. And mean nothing in my opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it wasn't the joke that ended the relationship. It was the resulting argument. 

Like she got into this whole, "You should be grateful for your son and that you get to be there for him."

and I was like "The fuck?!? Grateful? I love my son, but you couldn't possibly understand the toll that it takes one me." 

and then she like got into her whole bullshit about how hard her life is. which is laughable. I'm sure it's hard but chick got like 100K divorce settlement and her ex (who is an asshole) pays for private school for the kids. 99% of the problems she has are her own doing and not a shit roll of the dice of life. 

And I'm sure divorce isn't fun no matter how much money she had. Like I was there for her thru all of it. I alibied her when she was stepping out on her man. I helped her move. I babysat her kids. All kinds of shit. 


What ended it was really when I said, "If I can't make jokes about how unjust it is that meth heads can have perfectly normal kids and yet people that do everything right dont with You my bff since high school, then who can I?" and she said "Idk maybe other parents with kids with autism." 

In my opinion that was just a really nice way of saying: "Go fuck yourself".

I hadn't considered looking at pricing now. Or anything like that. 

That would really help me to ballpark the amount needed. Cuz there are all kinds of calculators to estimate future value. 

Thanks. 

Also yeah, I thought about all that stuff with additional children. 

I definitely didn't want to have them feeling less loved cuz I knew how that felt growing up. I was orphaned and taken in by family, but you could really see the difference in how much they cared for their actual children vs me. And i definitely wouldn't want my kid to feel like they were born to care for someone else. 

It's a serious problem. And something that always gives me pause.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not true at all. I very seriously couldn't handle my son having autism. It took a fair amount of therapy for myself to get over my want to just pack my shit and leave. 

After he was diagnosed, I got him every possible service he could, but as things got worse and I realized how much more help he needed, I got depressed. I started drinking. I got very very very obsessed with suicide and just leaving my husband and son and only having a financial obligation. 

Someone eventually noticed and helped me out. But I very well wouldn't be able to handle it now if not for outside intervention.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because they don't realize how hard it really is. 

I remember my sister in law would always say things that basically insinuated that I was just being lazy and a victim about my kid having autism. Nothing outright like that, but essentially suggesting that I dont make momming my focus. She has 3 kids and I only have 1. 

I'm trying to think of a decent example. The best I can think of is she once kinda got on me for not making everything from scratch. Like I buy premade pancake mix, meatballs shit like that. 

So basically, since she has 3 kids and makes all her shit from scratch that I should have the time cuz 3 kids has to be harder than 1 kid with autism. 

So she watched my son for me 2 times. 1 time he was pretty good but needed a little extra attention so no big deal. The 2nd time was more challenging, I believe at one point during the 4 hours she was watching him he decided to take off his diaper and pooped on the floor and then tried to clean it up which just kinda smeared it on things. 

After that day where she watched him she hasn't had such an attitude like she did before. I'm sure she still thinks I could do more, but I think she finally realized that it's not the same.  </TEXT>

Most people have a plan for their lives, even if that plan is have kids, send them to college and retire.

	<TEXT> Ah, I see. 

I am definitely not a huge fan of the tests. 

But I didn't realize how much emphasis they put on them. 

I think when I was in school that the big thing was you can't even really study for it. It was just, you either know it or you don't. 

They should go back to that or something like it. 

I know that the big push was to find out if the teachers were quality. 

But that's not a way to measure quality.

I could make anyone memorize 2+2=4 and get them to perform on some test and say that. But a real measure is finding out if the kid knows why. 
A good teacher can teach that and I don't see how many tests could test that. 

At least not if you have to teach like how you're doing to get them to pass it.

	<TEXT> To be fair, unless you adopt a child that is already old enough where you're sure they don't have a severe disability, you won't know right away anyway. Most people adopt young children (like sub 3). And for most it's not obvious that a kid has things like autism until over 2 years old. 

And even then it isn't a guarantee that nothing else will happen. One of my facebook friends is friends with someone who had a very bright normal child. And then one day they were at the park or something and a really heavy tree fell on the kids head. The kid survived and is alive but last I saw he's still in a wheelchair and they are making every effort they can to regain the abilities that he once had. I dont think he can talk, he can barely communicate, he's very much severely disabled. 

And idk even what someone would do at that point. Even if they could just give a 7 or 8 year old up for adoption while still keeping their other non-injured child. That would definitely make them the biggest pariahs ever.  </TEXT>

And we still did all that stuff. I'm not a teacher so I'm not saying I know all about your job and how it works now.

	<TEXT>  One day it hit me that none of that ends. That's your life until you die.

minor correction: that's you life even after you die. 

I don't mean like haunting and such. But I'm more afraid of what happens after I die than what happens up to that day. 

Like assuming I myself don't end up with dementia or something. Unless i have another child (which isn't even a guarantee of them giving a shit about their sibling) there will be no one to check on him after I go. 

I know many people who have or had elderly parents who had dementia or alzheimers and had to be put in homes. These people weren't like super poor that they had their parents in like super cheap state run homes or anything. But even in what were supposed to be good nursing homes, they still had tales of finding out that orderlies were stealing from their parents or not caring for them as they should. 

Knowing that my kid will likely live to 100 and I think the life expectancy for someone my age is about 80. When I'm 80 my son will be 55. That means he'll probably live another 45 years from then. That's 45 years of life that I have to hope that one of his cousins, maybe (if i can have another child) sibling, family friend, church friend or something is going to be around to make sure that he is being treated properly by people who are paid to look after him. Not to mention that I have to hope that some kind of social safety net is in place for him or that I could ever hope to have saved up enough money to last well past my own death to his. 

Maybe if there were like really good robots i'd be able to relax. Honestly, super intelligent robots and Trumps nuclear holocaust are the two biggest hopes for my future. Robots because as long as it's programmed appropriately a robot won't have the capacity for human style neglect and abuse, so i wouldn't have to worry. 

And in the case of the nuclear holocaust everything will end so no future to worry about. ;) (LOL)

	<TEXT> Just cuz the special needs doesn't turn up until later doesn't change how sever it is.

My son was diagnosed around 15-18 months old (1.5 years). He was considered high-functioning up until about 4 or 5. He didn't have language, he did the toe walking and hand flapping, he didn't do eye contact and such. But he could do a lot of stuff for himself. He would go get what he wanted (so he could tell you what he wanted), he knew how to use tablets and dvd players to an extent. 

However, even with us getting all the speech, aba and special schooling for him for the first few years of his life. His language barrier really has turned what seemed to be High functioning into maybe middling. He's still very smart, but he's almost 9 and still in diapers. There's many things that he can't do because of language problems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I know that feels. 

And I know how shitty it feels to feel that. 

Like you can't tell anyone you know things like that. 


I remember telling a friend once. That I wanted to have another kid and joked that in order to ensure that the kid was normal I'd drink and smoke the entire pregnancy. This is a joke because when I was pregnant with my son I was stone cold sober (was one of those evangelical Christians that don't drink) was taking prenatal vitamins cuz I get anemic and prenatal vitamins basically have everything you need to counteract that. And while pregnant I was super serious about everything that doctors and baby books said to do and avoid. 

Anyway, my friend called me a monster and what was a 15 year friendship was ended then. 

Not cuz of the joke persay. But because when she got upset about the joke and said that jokes like that aren't acceptable and why I'd even joke like that. 

Well I said I joked like that because I did everything medically appropriate while pregnant and she smoked weed and drank during both her pregnancies. And yet my son has autism and she's got kids in the gifted and talented program. And her response was I should be thankful for what I do have. But I don't see how being thankful and being upset can't co exist. 

I love my son more than anyone else, but at the same time, why can't I also hate that he has autism. Hate that it's not the parenting experience I'd like to have had? 

I'm sure if I had to get my foot cut off to save my life I'd be happy that I'm not dead, but I can also be upset that I don't have a foot anymore. They aren't mutually exclusive.

	<TEXT> Why can't you just do both? 

I know that tests have changed, but we had standardized testing when I was in school and we still did stuff like this. 

I remember for every subject in science, math, english, and history(social studies). We'd have one long project that went along with the theme of the chapter/section. 

I remember we did mold on sandwiches when we learned about fungus. We grew plants, we did research. And had lots of fun and at the same time we learned all the parts of a whatever. 

My favorite was from middle school. We were learning about cells. And the big project was we were going to make our own cells. 

In the mean time we learned about mitosis, what mitochondria was, RNA and DNA, shit like that. And after learning each part the teacher would have us brainstorm what kind of food stuff we could buy that looked like it. 

I'm sure I'm missing something but it just seems that testing as onerous as it may be doesn't stop people from doing these things.

	<TEXT> I lost 1.4 lbs since last weigh in. w00t! Okay, i was totally depressed last week when I only lost .3lbs. And I didn't do any of the shit I was supposed to do this week for weight loss. I didn't gorge myself or anything but you know I didn't track. 

So, I'm going to actually do this shit this week. Also I feel like a tool because I forgot to log my steps and shit and so we lost out on a bunch of work. 

1. I don't have any pets right now. I'm trying to get a dog but that's a whole thing cuz it has to be a service animal.
2. I only have 1 pair of shoes really. They're sneakers, Sketchers and black.

	<TEXT> When I was in high school, there was this kid with special needs. I think a middling  autism cuz he definitely didn't have downs syndrome. 

All my friends were kinda dicks to him. And apparently he used to touch himself in class, and so it felt justified to do so. 

Anyway here I am 16 years later and my son has autism. He's 8 and he often gets naked in inappropriate situations. People can be dicks about it. Not like, "Oh your kid is naked" but like kinda mean about it and about him. 

I fear that when he hits puberty that he'll probably not realize the boundaries of how you shouldn't touch yourself in public. And that kind of thing is for home in your room or bathroom. And because of this normal kids will treat him like shit. 

Also even tho he doesn't touch himself now, people especially kids treat him like shit. 

Took him to Vacation Bible School and the best class that would work for him was the 5 year olds. So he's 2 years older, anyway some of them didn't want to touch him during group games (like ring around the rosie and stuff) 

At the park i've heard kids say, "Don't play with him cuz he's too stupid to know how to talk"

From his cousins I've heard, "Why does he have a baby's brain"

These effect me probably more than him. But Occasionally I think about that boy from high school and how he must have felt and how his parents must have felt. 

side note: When I heard the comment from the kids at the playground (which wasn't said to my son but between themselves) I had to grab my son and leave the park. I was like seconds away from saying some devastatingly fucked up shit to a 6 year old.  </TEXT>

But if he's like a drunk or something who'd say sure tickets and then be the kind of person to hock them somehow for drugs, I'd not bother. 

Tho possibly instead of relying on him to come to them maybe do a whole family trip to that state during the summer if you can and let them hang with him and you do something else. 

Just as work arounds to his flakiness.

	<TEXT> I'd liken it much to drinking excessively. 

I am an alcoholic. But I couldn't stop until I wanted to stop. You can mention the weight and how it's hurting her. But she's not going to stop until she's had enough. 

And don't feel bad if you can't continue along with her on that road. 

Just cuz it's weight and eating won't make you a jerk for saying "I'm not going to watch you do this to yourself and I have to go." 

I hope it doesn't get to that point but honestly don't feel shamed for not wanting to be around for that. Cuz diabetes and all the obesity related diseases can become really gut wrenching to be around. 

Just like when I was drinking, things weren't that bad. I'd drink but basically I was the same person I am now, but I wouldn't have blamed my husband for saying, "I'm not going to watch you kill yourself with booze" 

So don't blame yourself if you can't watch her kill herself with food.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When a bad thing happens it's also because of those same two things just the opposite (bad luck and doing something incorrectly). 

My kid has autism, why? Bad luck. Genetics or not it's bad luck that I have those genes i certainly did everything medically appropriate while pregnant. 

I got into a car accident once, why? Because I wasn't paying attention to the road appropriately. So I did something incorrectly. 

It's just as appropriate to ask why me for good and bad results or whatever. However, when I'm thinking why do I have a million dollars, people don't consider it self pity but introspection. But if I'm thinking about why I can't afford groceries, or why I have a disease, people do consider it self pity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I remember that terrible movie 40 days and 40 nights. I was a teenaged girl and thought how is this chick mad about him "having sex" when he was 1, tied up, 2, didn't want to, and 3, was drunk? or something like that. 


I don't remember the enchanted but I wasn't a huge fan of that movie. IIRC that movie was the one where the chick came from fairytale land to NYC? If so I hated it because it was like heavy handedly about how women can do whatever they want.

Which is fine, but I just don't see too many movies about how men can do whatever they want. In fact, I believe this was around the time Disney really started pushing the motivational Girl Power princesses trope. 

But I notice that they don't have anything similar for boys. Boys need role models and people saying they can do anything they put their minds to as well. 

Also not a huge fan of Enterprise. Tho i haven't watched it.

	<TEXT>  Infuriated at the double standard, I am incentivized more to try to relax and enjoy this experience. I pull my book out for a distraction.

What the hell is she talking about? There's no double standard other than her own mental hangups. 

I'm a chick. I'm also overweight. I'm also not going to go to a nude beach because of my own mental hangups about being naked in front of strangers. But I'm also not going to go around acting like it's some weird double standard. 

 As we almost reach the end of the beach, a stalky, silver-haired nude man probably around my fathers age approaches me and says the rest of the beach is too rocky to go down. He may have very well had good intentions, but after a lifetime of being approached by creepy men, a small voice in my head says, He wants you to stop here so he can see your tits. I try to ignore it. 

So now this dude is some kind of creeper because he gave her advice? Could he have been a creeper? Sure, but maybe he's just a sensible dude who gives advice to newbies at the beach. She seems rather on edge about EVERYTHING.

Also I read the bikini one that she wrote http://archive.is/7DU6R

She seems to have upped the bitchiness in this nude beach one. However, she does seem to be slightly upset at people for looking at her in that one too. Of course people are going to look at you, you're outside and in a bikini in NYC AND you have the number 30 written on your stomach and the 3 is backwards. I'd look at her weird too. 

Fucking "VICTIMS"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm doing the /r/bodyweightfitness program using their Android app. 

I figure that I might be more likely to actually go thru with the workouts if we worked together. 

I'm going to do my workouts Monday Wednesday and Friday. 

Anyone else interested in doing the same? 

We can link up via snapchat or IG or twitter or something. And remind eachother to get it in! And guilt eachother into doing it when we don't feel like it. LOL

	<TEXT> Disney licenses tons of shit that they can do themselves. They don't do it themselves because they would rather not have to deal with it. 

Nintendo can do it themselves. But I imagine the patents by niantic might be cost prohibitive for them at this juncture </TEXT>
