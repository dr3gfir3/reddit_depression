	<TEXT> They're a minority fringe fortunately, just a vocal and emboldened one presently.

It is worth pushing back.  Both for the sake of the people they're targeting (if you're lucky enough that's not you personally) and for the sake of the state of the society more broadly.

Far right nationalism has a long, *long* history in this country and it's bubbled away under the surface since colonial days.  Every now and then it spills over and every now and again we beat it back into the dirt.

We can and will do it again and you only need to look at the successes of the broadly tolerant, multicultural Australia we've grown this country into to see why the fight's worth fighting, as exasperating as it can be dealing with this sort of ignorance and hatred. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well they've certainly done a fine job of painting themselves in a bad light recently.  Their social media presence reads like it's managed by Alex Jones.

On more substantive subjects, there is a growing pool of documentation that has been touted for release and then quietly buried, or openly so in the case of Assange's comments during the recent US election.

Add dubious business relationships, increasingly erratic commentary and now repeated attacks on other organisations releasing information such as the ICIJ and you rapidly wound the credibility of an organisation that porports itself to be an arbiter of the truth whilst being so opaque. </TEXT>

They hold singular accounts yet with amazing temerity and incredible alacracy to the contents of private communications between Mr Thwaites and other individuals *via other mediums* their actions cast him as the racist cunt he was accused of being.

He really should address this, as to a casual observer you would think it was all coming from the same person. </TEXT>

* Get 10 or so journos from The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, CNN, The Guardian, BBC, Suddeutsche Zeitung, Le Monde, ABC Australia, ICIJ etc. in a room.

* Go through the documents together, identify high profile names agree on time tables for a mass release from their own outlets.  Have it all written up and ready to be published with the push of a button.

* Send it to Wikileaks and watch those names like hawks for a few weeks and see how much the content of the leaks is acted on.

And either a few weeks later when Wikileaks should have had time to vet *or* the second they tweet the release, everyone publishes including the document in full and unedited. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You confuse integration for assimilation.  Australia's multicultural society is grounded in the former.

As to what it represents, I could say much the same about numerous more traditionally "Australian" institutions and there's some irony in decrying treatment of people as second class citizens whilst deeming them inappropriate to represent Australians on a billboard advertising Australia Day.

I'd also suggest you get to know a few Muslim women. </TEXT>

"There were a series of complaints, some of which were of an abusive and threatening nature, that were made to the organisation QMS that put the billboard up," he said.

"And they've made a decision based on the safety of their employees and business infrastructure to temporarily remove the billboard."

Doubt they were threatening to tickle 'em.  I've been on the receiving end of enough to guess at the content. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There definitely needs to be some thought put into it.

Victoria's IBAC is ultimately pretty toothless.  NSW's ICAC may have overreached to an extent though I'd argue it's biggest problem was that it aimed at things other than what the NSW government expected.

All that said though, this has been a "must do" for well over a year now, a "should do" for arguably a decade or more and it's *clearly* got massive support in the electorate.  If the Labor Party *and* the Liberal Party don't have policies ready to go on this they're frankly negligent. </TEXT>

You'd need a real factional outsider to pull the trigger on this, that or a party facing complete electoral oblivion.  Anything meaningful is going to result in a bipartisan bloodbath by the looks of it.

One interesting option would be the crossbench denying both support *and* supply to either side until it's implemented.  The majors could band together but I can just imagine how well that would go down with the electorate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd somewhat disagree.  Trump would take an existential threat to his business quite seriously.

Don't forget Russia has objectives in the near term as well, in particular the French and German elections via Front National and AfD respectively.

Furthermore, dividing US institutions and electorate from the President would have impacts measured in years even if Trump was Article 25d on day one.  Any successor is still going to have to deal with a core of Trump true believers that are sufficient in size to cause major political disruption regardless of the extent of any potential betrayal of the Union. </TEXT>

As people may or may not know, you can connect most USB keyboards to an iPad or iPhone via the USB Camera Kit Apple sells.  What I'm wondering is whether you can cut the middle man out and build a cable that runs directly from mini USB to Lightning and have it work.

Has anyone given it a try?  Hoping to build a short little cable for my new Minivan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely.  Current conversations on climate change, water, fracking etc. have started to challenge that narrative a bit and the recent milk industry issues showed a party, or at least MPs, prepared to go out of their way to act as an advocate.

It's very much baby steps at this stage but ones worth continuing.  The rural vote is significant and just as deserving of a voice as anyone else.  The Nats locked up the former whilst failing utterly on the latter. </TEXT>

Out of curiosity, I've noticed that the modifier key behaviour is different depending on the order of the key presses.

In particular Win + Fn + L is different behaviour to Fn + Win + L

I assume there's no way to make the behaviour consistent regardless of the order and I'm just going to have to retrain the fingers, yes? </TEXT>

The Commission does not currently have the power to make decisions as to the standards of the case and what does and does not go before the courts.  In fact, the AHRC under Triggs has been seeking the power to make such decisions for several years now with no action from Government to so empower the Commission.

The AHRC does not bring cases.  Nor does it have the power to prevent causes being brought.  Though I see Turnbull's slur on both the Commission and Triggs has had its desired effect regardless. </TEXT>
