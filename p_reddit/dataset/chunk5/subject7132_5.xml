	<TEXT> About Keith Girard, author: 

Keith Girard 30 years of experience as a reporter, editor-in-chief, and senior media executive. Keiths career began in Washington, D.C., where he was a reporter for The Washington Post and worked as a contributing editor for Regardies, a regional business magazine, and Washingtonian magazine.

In 1992, he became editor-in-chief of The Daily Record, a six-day business and legal newspaper published statewide in Maryland and editor of its sister publication, Warfields Business Record, a weekly newspaper. In its third year of publication, Warfields was named the best regional business newspaper in the United States by the Association of Area Business Publications (AABP), a national trade group that represents 68 newspapers. In 1996, he merged Warfields into The Daily Record to become part of its expanded weekend edition. The following year, the AABP named The Daily Record the best business publication in the United States.

In all, the paper won more than 60 editorial awards under his tenure from the Maryland, Delaware, D.C. Press Association, the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), the Associated Press, and the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW) for reporting, editorial writing, graphics and layout, and design. Through his work at The Daily Record, Girard gained a reputation for turning around publications and was recruited by Crain to take over InvestmentNews at a critical time 18 months after the newspapers launch.

Because of his success at InvestmentNews, he attracted the attention of VNU Business Media and was offered the role of editor-in-chief of Billboard magazine. As editor-in-chief of Billboard magazine, Keith oversaw a global staff with five bureaus in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. In just one year, he engineered a complete overhaul of the newspaper and led the paper through a strategic redirection that included two staff reorganizations, expanded coverage, the opening of a San Francisco bureau to cover digital music, the launch of a new Web site and Billboards first e-newsletters and a major industry event focused on touring.

In his own reporting career, Keith has won nearly two dozen journalism awards for feature writing, general reporting, investigative reporting, editorial writing, headlines, and publication layout and design. He has written one book, on the role of the Marines in Operation Desert Shield/Storm. In 1982, he was named one of the 100 future leaders of Washington, D.C., by Washingtonian magazine.

	<TEXT> Yeah, agreed on your assessment of this source. I wavered prior to posting, but am glad I did as it's generating some good dialogue here...and it also speaks to my own concerns that he may have dementia. I'm old enough to remember Reagan going downhill. (In fact, as a kid I met and campaigned for Reagan).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was at a Dartmouth hiking lodge up in NH. Someone broke out extremely dank crippy. We gazed into the firelight and smoked for hours. Smoking and taking and gazing. After a while the light in the embers just started to come alive as patterns and, eventually, as full on little creatures. It is was quite fun. The rational side of me knew it was simply the weed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not so black and white to many of us. This headline asks a question and then endeavors to answer it. I don't see how this article or this resulting dialogue disrespects the democratic process. There is a system. It is being tested. 

You're likely arguing in defense of what you think protects the American people, and I certainly feel that I am doing the same. We are America, and we are all trying like hell to figure out the next steps. What happened was a big deal. To wave that away is disingenuous. My work trying to dispell the onslaught of fake news throughout this election was exhaustive and futile. So from my perspective - dealing in boring and mundane facts versus a barrage of Macedonian bloggers ad nauseum - it was like my team showed up clean and the opponent was on steroids. Literally half of my Republican friends still believe Hillary ran a child sex ring. Dude. That shit is bananas.  </TEXT>
