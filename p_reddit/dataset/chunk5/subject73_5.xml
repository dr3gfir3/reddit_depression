	<TEXT> Hey there. I'll just cut to the chase- I find it incredibly hard to empathize with people. Sometimes I do find myself empathizing with people, but as soon as I realize it the empathy goes away and I can't figure out how to get it back. I was just wondering if I could have any help "faking it till I make it" or any advice from others who were in a similar position. Thanks! -Gallifralone </TEXT>
