	<TEXT> A White House official said that Bannon was placed on the committee in part to monitor Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and never attended a meeting. Hes no longer needed with McMaster in charge of the council, the official said.

Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13 for not disclosing to the president or to Vice President Mike Pence the extent of his conversations with Russias ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, before Trumps inauguration.

Which, of course, means that either they're lying or they knew Flynn was a security risk but went ahead with it anyway. All while taking the joint chiefs out.

The United States has announced a shift in its diplomatic policy on Syria and is no longer insisting that its president Bashar al-Assad be removed as the head of the war-torn country.

In a clear departure from the Obama administration's stance on Assad, and against EU policy, the US is now moving its focus to its battle with Isis.

http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/us-shifts-focus-syria-no-longer-prioritising-removing-assad-office-1614589

Based on the Trump administration's statements as to who to blame and why, and Trump's actions, the only logical conclusion is that these chemical weapons attacks by the Assad regime on Syrian citizens is the fault of Donald Trump and his policymakers.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the last administration's weakness and irresolution, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a 'red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing.

Meanwhile, four days ago:

The United States has announced a shift in its diplomatic policy on Syria and is no longer insisting that its president Bashar al-Assad be removed as the head of the war-torn country.

	<TEXT> Interagency intelligence sharing was started under Bush in reaction to 9/11, especially with the 2004 intelligence reform act. Obama did, yes, reauthorize the PATRIOT Act 3 times, including the expansion to narcoterrorism. But significant protections were also put in place under Obama that didn't exist under Bush and are now once again being stripped away under Trump. 

Spying is a fact of life if you want to have any kind of society in the modern world. But this "both sides are equally bad" rhetoric that keeps being spouted is patent bullshit. Obama did a lot of terrible things but he is by no means as bad as Bush or Trump. Not even close.  </TEXT>

Because, if you really think about it, there probably weren't that many cameras on it in the first place and in 2001, it's possible they weren't storing the data off site. Even if they were, security camera footage would be low priority. The cameras on the Pentagon were likely destroyed by having a plane hit them. Flying a plane into it is not great for the structural integrity or storage capabilities of a device. The cameras aren't capturing the other side of the building, they tend to film the side of the building they're on, thus any that captured it would have been hit. They Pentagon also generally frowns on cameras being pointed at it, so there probably weren't many outside cameras filming the incident. No one had cell phone cameras at the time and only tourists and news crews carry video recording devices, neither of which was likely recording the Pentagon because, in all honesty, it's a pretty boring building. No one would be generally filming the sky because why would they? There are 3 airfields nearby (Bolling AFB, National, and Dulles) plus two others nearby in Maryland (Andrews AFB and BWI). So a plane near the Pentagon isn't unusual. 


All this to say, to have video of the plane flying into the Pentagon, you'd need to have a camera pointed at the sky focusing on the correct plane that wasn't on the Pentagon. The chances of this happening are very fucking low.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Am a lawyer. Immunity grants, in these kinds of situations, typically come with conditions and it's almost never a blank check. It's usually immunity from any crimes related to the incident in question. Immunity implicitly means you're waiving the Fifth, though you usually sign an explicit waiver (unless you get a deal where the statements can't be used against you if the immunity is later withdrawn, which often happens). The immunity is in exchange for honesty and testimony, so if you lie or omit anything or refuse to do anything the prosecutor asks, the immunity can be withdrawn and you better believe all those statements you made will be used to prosecute you through parallel construction. Immunity keeps you out of jail, but you become the government's bitch and you're probably going to be looking over your shoulder the rest of your life because you snitched and did no time. 

It's not unusual in cases like this to request immunity, even if the defendant has nothing. It's basically a negotiation tactic, signalling that you possibly have information to trade if you get to walk.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What did I ignore. Did Clinton win the primarys popular vote in 2008 yes or no? 

No one knows because we don't have an actual popular vote count. 

And when are Dems planning on changing their delegate system. The DNC unity reform commission hasn't done shit about it.  

Probably because the DNC chair election just happened and the committee is still not fully staffed. It needs time to actually, you know, exist first. Not that I have much hope for it, but at least it's a step in the right direction.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...they do both. Turns out Dems are quite capable of working to change both. Unlike Republicans, most Dems are not single issue voters.  

Also, gotta love that you completely ignored that I showed you were wrong. Sticking to that narrative eh?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dems don't actually like superdelegates either. Or did you not pay attention to the shitshow that was the Democratic primary?  

And Clinton won the popular vote of the states that were actually counted.  Iowa, Maine, Nevada, and Washington didn't release popular vote results so no idea if they made up the difference. The count included Florida, which neither Clinton nor Obama contested, and Michigan, where Obama withdrew from the ballot yet Clinton did not. DNC penalized Florida and Michigan for violating party rules.

Basically, we have no idea what the actual popular vote totals were in the 2008 Democratic Primary, but we do know the two candidates were within 1% of each other on popular vote, within the margin of error.  </TEXT>
