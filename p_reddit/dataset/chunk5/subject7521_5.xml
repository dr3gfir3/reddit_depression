	<TEXT> I live on a really small lot in a tent. Yesterday I woohoo'd with Sergio Romeo and ended up pregnant. He was very unhappy about it when I told him. He hates children so he won't let me move in with him. It is hard enough providing for myself but now I will have a child to take care of as well. :(

Edit: gave birth and haven't been able to sleep since! My son cries a lot and I'm getting tired of it! Trying to get child services to come free me of this giant burden.

Edit: well, I lost my son due to neglect and I thought it would be better that way but now I miss him a lot. I've spent months try to scrap together enough money to build a small shelter. It's not much but at least I have a roof over my head! I tried to get my child back now that I'm more stable but it seems he's been adopted already :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. Waking up and having to continue with life is so hard...I get angry, I don't know if that makes sense. Sometimes I just lay in bed and pretend I'm dead anyway and fantasize about my funeral. </TEXT>
