	<TEXT> I have a friend that got a girlfriend and now I hardly hear from him. We made plans a while back to shoot pool and have a couple beers and he flaked cuz he got drunk with his alcoholic girlfriend and couldn't drive. I tried to make plans every weekend after that for a month and he would never make time for me because his girlfriend came first. Don't only not flake, make time for your friends even if you have a girlfriend. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean friendships don't matter anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My first thought. Copy paste face. Have her smile. Make her laugh, it produces the most genuine smile. Have her lean out from behind something. Have her make silly faces. See if she can slightly squint both eyes equally instead of one like she's staring into the sun. Have her tilt her head forward and look up at you. Or get beside her and have her look out at something and get that angle. There are so many options and you're in control, take the lead and direct your subject to give yourself a more interesting subject to look at. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depression caused job loss for me yet again. I was pretty successful too for a while until it took over and did so much damage mentally that I couldn't face anyone and my anxiety was through the roof at just the thought of seeing someone else. I wish there was job security or protection for when things like this happen, but people don't understand this isn't a choice, and they arent willing to wait it out. Depression sucks. </TEXT>
