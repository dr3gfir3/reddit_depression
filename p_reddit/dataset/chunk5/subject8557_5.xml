	<TEXT> I was working nearby at a low wage job I had to take to fit my uni schedule. He came in and took a liking to me and offered me a job serving at comet. I declined for months but finally I thought that if the money was better and, since James was so well known and in good standing in the DC area, that he would have good reason not to make me uncomfortable or do anything. I was wrong. Stressed, overworked with school and far from home nearing the end of my 2nd year at Uni, I needed someone to talk to and I went for some drinks with him. That's pretty much how it happened.  </TEXT>

He definitely would have had the resources to pull that kind of thing but I am kind of on the fence as to whether he would do it. I should also note that I think I have some of the symptoms of Stockholm Syndrome.
