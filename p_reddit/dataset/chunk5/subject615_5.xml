	<TEXT> Add me on Xbox. GT is Zorbs 1017. Was rising star in 3s last season and currently Platinum 1 in solo duel so I can fend for myself quite well. Looking for a solid doubles partner because I solo queued my way to Gold 1 Div 3 and need someone to communicate with to climb the ranks. My rank in 2s doesn't justify where I really should be and I can prove it to you if you give me the chance.

Mechanical strengths are aerials, dribbling on-ground and wall aerials/passes. (Working on my air dribbles, only landed a few thus far) Pretty solid on defense but prefer mid to front fieldI can adjust to any position though as I'd like to consider myself a well rounded player.  </TEXT>
