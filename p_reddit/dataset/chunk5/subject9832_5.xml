	<TEXT> It's just how I feel right now.  I HATE IT. I didn't think I would feel this way again. I personally feel like love is a word that's tossed around entirely to much.  Everyday I just see people use it as a hello or as a way to say goodbye.'' Ok love ya!'' It bugs me.  The words deserves more than that. I've made the mistake of abusing the term with people I honestly didn't love. Now I try to not to say things I dont mean.  And when it comes to something like this I just want to say it.  I just want to tell random strangers without looking like a weirdo '' IM IN LOVE MR MAILMAN.  IM IN LOVE 7 ELEVEN GUY.'' Is it just me? I know some people find love and it's just amazing seeing two people in love with each other.  7 billion  people on this planet and they managed  to narrow it down and find each other.  Old couples that been together for YEARS have this.  LOVE GROWS.  I used to think it was this singular thing but fuck does it expand like when a sun runs out of carbon and starts burning helium(something may be wrong there.) . It's this emotional soreness.  Ever miss someone that you love? Their absence lingers. It effects you PHYSICALLY. Why THE FUCK. I know this might all sound negative and I really should have used a throw away but I don't care.  I just had this epiphany this morning at breakfast with her.  Oh boy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last night I decided to take the Boeing 747 at Los Santos Airport for a circle around San Andreas.  Flying this bad boy in first person is amazing.You can move the camera around so you can look off to one side and see that sexy thang called San Andreas or look off to another side and see a vast beautiful ocean. Coming full circle and tempted to crash this mother fucker into a building I thought I try and land it. Unfortunately I started my decent way, way to early and I swore I heard screaming. (Could have been in my head. It would be truely morbid if this airplane was filled with hundreds of San Andreas residents.) The plane crash into the ocean just short of the runway. I will attempt this again because it was truely an interesting 15 minutes and oddly relaxing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was 6 I would eat my dads sweets he had hidden(mostly powerded doughnuts or danishes) I never got caught because I would take them into my sisters bedroom (who was 4 at the time.) and put some of the crumbs in her bed or around her face and leave the wrapper in there. My dad would wake up , find his sweets missing, he would go into my sisters room and see the evidence. I felt pretty bad when he would scold her for lieing,she would promise that she didnt eat them but it was hard to believe her when she had powered sugar on her face and around her bed. I'm 23 now and shes 21 and my dad still thinks that she ate his sweets. (I've openly admitted that I was the one who did it to my sister but when were around family and the topic comes up I deny it.) </TEXT>
