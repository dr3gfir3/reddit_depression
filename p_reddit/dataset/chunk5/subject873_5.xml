	<TEXT> I always thought Seinfeld was an amazing show. Then I moved to New York City and realized just how brilliant it really is. It really was a next-level show. Some of the jokes are funny to everyone but hilarious to New Yorkers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would it be possible to add Yelp to the list of companies that can be reviewed? That way, all the companies that Yelp is essentially extorting money from could give them shitty reviews. I would like to see this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was in my 20s, some friends and I used to call into a college radio show and talk shit. They would put us on air because we were pretty funny. Mostly we were a bit drunk and really high. One week, the regular hosts of the show weren't there and they had a couple newbie guest hosts. We called up and convinced them that we could hear ourselves on air even though they didn't put us on air. We then had a friend call and make a song request. Then we called back and were like "we totally just heard that girl's song request on air." They freaked out and thought they were having technical difficulties that were way beyond their understanding but really they just had a few dick listeners. I guess I don't actually feel too bad about it now but I did feel bad for a week or two. </TEXT>
