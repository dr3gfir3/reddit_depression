	<TITLE> subject2223's special recipe for cranberries (making cranberry sauce is easy) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-22 17:31:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You will need:

 * 2 bags fresh cranberries
 * fresh ginger
 * 1 cup water
 * 1 12oz can frozen Orange Juice
 * maybe some sugar


Put the cranberries in a pot with the water and grated ginger (as much as you want a lot is good) and simmer until all the berries have popped and formed a thick jam. Add the frozen OJ and let it melt.  Heat it for about 10-15 minutes but don't let it boil.  The orange juice will make it bitter if it boils. Taste the cranberries to see if you need to add more sugar.  The OJ has quite a bit of sugar so you might not need extra but I added about 1/2 cup.  

I keep my ginger frozen so I have it whenever I want some.  I just grate it frozen into whatever I need it in.

	<TEXT> First off not feeling like an adult is a pretty good indicator that you are doing okay :) I am still not sure how I ended up being trusted with adult responsibilities.  

Some general good things to be able to do: 

 - Make your own meals.  It's always cheaper and healthier to cook for yourself.  
 - Learn to be good at grocery shopping.  Figure out your staples and learn to be flexible with some things.  
 - learn how to make simple repairs and clean stuff properly.  The internet is awesome for this. 
 - Keep track of your finances.  Again the internet is a big help here.  /r/personalfinance has great resources for this.
 - Make sure to read and ask questions about all your employer's benefits.  Make sure to get dental and vision insurance if it's at all feasible.  
 - pick up after yourself 
 

There is really a ton of stuff.  Is there anything you feel particularly out of your depth doing?  Or things you think other people do but aren't so sure?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every day or every other day is going to be best.  Don't feel like you have to shower in the morning though - I have always showered at night.  It's relaxing before bed and I don't like getting up too early.  Figure out what time of day works best for you, it could be morning, evening, at the gym, etc....

1. Gift cards.  They want you to sell gift cards. 

2. Approach them and ask if they need help. Let them know closing time is in 5 minutes and help them get whatever they need. 

3. Make sure they know you are watching them - offer help and be friendly.  Get coworkers to offer to help them wherever they have scattered to.  (I believe this question is related to shoplifting) 

4. Stay within sight of the kid and get your manager.

5. Offer them a basket to carry things in.  If you saw what they got ask about it in a non accusatory way - "these blue sweaters are my favorite!  you should try one on!" 

6. Time to make sure everyone is on the floor.  Also make sure to greet them this is another "I am watching you" moment. 

7.  If a coworker is close try to ask them to answer.  If not politely tell the customer excuse me for just a moment, pick up phone, politely let them know you need to put them on hold and finish ringing up customer.  You may want to ask if you should answer the phone at all.  Often when you work the register you are not in charge of phones too.


In general when answering shoplifting questions:

 - give people baskets 
 - do not accuse anyone
 - if people are gathering shit offer to take it to the register for them.  
 - if they run let them go, never follow, never accuse anyone of stealing

	<TEXT> Get a refresher but ask them not to add the water and to put it in the blender.  The whole cup should be filled with ice and blended with the regular amount of refresher concentrate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you or your child ever have an "accident" please do not try to flush your - underpants, shirt, baby pajamas, child sized jeans, or other clothing down the potty in the public restroom.

I also recommend not flushing a towel or plastic soda cup. 

Or the shattered remains of the toilet paper dispenser you just demolished.
