	<TEXT> It's called free speech, dude. Idiots didn't adopt the concept; geniuses did. Protest is a right that all Americans have because men and women have died /suffered unspeakable losses in order to make/keep America free for all of its people. It's not about being an "edgy little shit," how you put it. It's about being honest with ourselves that our Nation isn't so star-spangled awesome and we don't actually embody the ideals conveyed by the Anthem.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The flag is just a flag and the anthem is just a song. Any laws protecting the "sanctity" of the flag I.e. the Flag Code, were ruled unconstitutional, as it's regulations violate the First Amendment. Said amendment also guards you against reprisals for "voicing" how *you* feel about the anthem and what *you* believe it embodies. As long as you don't promote hatred with your protest, you are completely in your rights to do so.
