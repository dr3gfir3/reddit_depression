	<TEXT> The team discovered these speech patterns using a new type of waterproof microphone called a hydrophone. This allowed them to record two dolphins at the reserve - named Yasha and Yana - with a high level of detail.

After analysing these recordings, the team says they've found evidence that the dolphins were forming 'words', by emitting different pulses that varied in frequency, volume level, and spectrum, just like human language.

While it's impossible to know at this stage what these words could mean, the team says the dolphins appeared to be forming sentences up to five words in length during their brief conversation.

There's even evidence of grammatical structures in place too, which would allow for more complex sentences, but more evidence is needed to confirm this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the days following the election, Trump expressed deep frustration about how Christie was handling the transition. In particular, he vented about how the governor had loaded up the team with lobbyists, the very class of people Trump had campaigned against, with his calls to drain the swamp in Washington. The president-elect also noticed that Christie had stocked his team with old New Jersey friends and allies.

There were other issues. Once the dust settled from their surprise win, the Trump team noticed that Christie had done little to vet potential administration picks or to dig into potential conflicts of interests. With Democrats eager to pounce on any early mistake, it was an oversight they simply couldnt afford. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the only living bird species that specializes in feeding on marrow. The bearded vulture can swallow whole or bite through brittle bones up to the size of a lamb's femur[10] and its powerful digestive system quickly dissolves even large pieces. The bearded vulture has learned to crack bones too large to be swallowed by carrying them in flight to a height of 50150 m (160490 ft) above the ground and then dropping them onto rocks below, which smashes them into smaller pieces and exposes the nutritious marrow.

	<TEXT> Recently on view as part of Sculpture by the Sea in Bondi, this unusual figurative sculpture by artist Alessandra Rossi seems to have captured the imagination of many, becoming one of the most popular pieces of this years exhibition. Titled Untitled (coral), Rossi says the piece depicting a solitary young girl in a dress is inspired in part by the phenomenon of coral bleaching, something that occurs in nature when ocean water becomes too warm and coral begins to expel an algae giving it a white appearance. Additionally, the work grapples with modern issues of identity, functioning as a metaphor for the patination and discoloration of emotion engendered by the digital era.

The sculptures translucent layered appearance changes dramatically when viewed from different angles during the day and at times almost vanishes against the horizon of Bondi beach.

A polar bear peers up from beneath the melting sea ice on Hudson Bay as the setting midnight sun glows red from the smoke of distant fires during a record-breaking spell of hot weather. The Manitoba population of polar bears, the southernmost in the world, is particularly threatened by a warming climate and reduced sea ice. </TEXT>
