	<TEXT> I wonder: If they do make a season 2, that instead of picking up where we left the story; they'll retell the one we've already heard but from a different perspective. One that's not "The OAs" narrative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first 30 seconds may be a key to the whole show.  OA is seen in a video filmed running across traffic ( on what some say are two different bridges in NYC or St.Louis ). The child filming says to his mother : "She's going to the otherside" and "She let go" right before OA jumps of the bridge. 

I feel like the phrase "She's going to the otherside" is profound here and opens up possibilities to new angles. 

What if the bridge jump scene and the waking up in the hospital scene didnt happen linearly. They're  two separate events.  I have a subreddit on this topic hitting other issues.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol. I get what your saying. I was also trying to point out to us as the viewers hearing and seeing this story,  that saying " She's going to the otherside" may play as a key in understanding the narrative, and putting things together in a outer box perspective  </TEXT>
