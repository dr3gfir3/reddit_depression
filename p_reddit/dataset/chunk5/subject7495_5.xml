	<TEXT> No the Republican did what most professional establishment candidates do-worry about re election. 

Repeal Obama Care whuh whooo. Then since they are always pandering and can't handle negative feed back they feel the urge to hold a pity party and feed the public a line of crap with catchy wording-repeal and replace.

Rather than be honest and say a repeal is needed but certain provisions will be kept or discarded they over promised to get votes and keep their egos safe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Insurance companies and those dealing in/with medicaid got subsidies. The people who handle and distribute the money got more money. The customer/patients, doctors, hospitals, clinics etc didn't get money to pay for actual care. The cost issues that caused affordability problems in the first were never properly addressed. The ACA focused on insurance issues, not care   costs.

The Republicans didn't vote for Obama Care. The bill was passed along partisan lines.

	<TEXT> This is handout for the insurance companies. 

If a person can't afford insurance with some making so little they're exempt from Obama Care IRS fees/fines what the heck do they think a 30% penalty will do. And they'll have the same issues. So many of a poorer person resources will go to just paying premiums they won't be able to pay for actual care/services. 

CARE and COSTS are THE issues. Not how private sector insurance companies are going to get paid. That's why Obama Care is failing now-it poorly addressed CARE and COST issues. The problem is the medical care industry and insurance industry are codependent. They need each because they've both learn how to exploit each other and the customers/patients.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump CARE is as bad as Obama CARE because they're both INSURANCE bills. The problem with Obama CARE it never thoroughly addressed the actual care costs issues, it was just another way to throw money at a problem. 

They need a separate repeal of Obama Care with a sunset on the popular provisions. For now "Trump Care" will have to be the repeal of Obama Care. They'll need to put into law the popular provisions as stand alone provisions.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They 'tap' with high tech surveillance systems. Not an individual device on one line. Fiber optics make the old school wire tap obsolete. 

 One would need a device to pick up lots of blips of light per second and then decode a digitized or encrypted signal on a specific frequency/light spectrum. There might be tech to out there to tap the fiber or line but most taps would have to placed on any equipment used on premises.

 I'm surprised the media didn't note or pick up on that. Trump is/was using outdated terminology/technology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's the issue with government hires and appointees in general. And the higher up the position the more politics and politicians involved. A job in DC especially comes with implied if not direct favors to be paid off/given. The municipal secretary, clerk or sanitation worker etc not so much although they'll be expected to work on somebodies campaign, fill out form letters or place a signature on a petition one day. 

Even at the local level loyalty to a politician that helped one get a government job is expected to do things like work on a campaign, answer phones, deliver flyers etc. One only knows what a politician wants of someone like a police officer they helped get the job.

Point being most government positions are filled with or through political favors even though a politician might not be directly handling the situation. They trade favors like baseball cards sometimes not even knowing the details.

The multiple FISA requests and NSA sharing intelligence with other agencies is the key.

Sooner or later that shared information and ability will be used to convict people of non national security related crimes at the federal and local level.

One of the things Penneys did several years ago was to cut out the sales and go with the lower every day pricing. Problem is other stores with sales and discounters beat those prices. This was a two fold problem-pricing was still an issue and by not advertising the public starts forgetting you're there. They went back to sales and advertising and starting selling some appliances again which was good but too late. 

Hopefully the company survives in some form along with the employees. </TEXT>

It almost sounds like the local politicians are saying the soda companies should just absorb the entire tax themselves. Most will not absorb an increase like that nor they cannot afford to absorb it. So things like layoffs are not a surprise. They'll need another tax to fund the unemployed.

Then they are falling short on their desired revenue goals. Duh, people simply cannot afford spend like that, especially over time. If this tax is new and the numbers are already off what do they think they'll look like by the end of the year.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a member of a union for a sickout. Myself and others got suspended for a week. The union told management they called out sick on their behalf and they won the arbitration 8 years later. 

Protest is one thing. Calling in sick is another. Lying to your boss or not meeting basic job requirements like showing up is a completely different game.

It was not a national holiday. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Union members are more conservative than one would think. Partly because of the money many make and the ability to move to neighborhoods with needs and views more in line with conservatives.  The money makes them a fiscal conservative fairly quick. I know union members who were/are the Republican chair in their town. And they sent their kids to private school, 4 of them last count. </TEXT>
