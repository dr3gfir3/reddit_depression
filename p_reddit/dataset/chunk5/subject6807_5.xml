He really, really doesn't like that film. I think part of it is how personal the story is to him (alcoholic author that could potentially harm his own family).

	<TEXT>  What does Cinemax have to do to get more viewers? 

Good question.

I actually asked here once and the consensus seemed to be there way no way for them to do that since people just look at it like a shit channel based around softcore porn. Which is why I think it's sad they decided to have both The Knick and Quarry there when they could've taken them elsewhere. Guess they had their reasons though.

This show is like the perfect blend of these great pulpy elements and it's beautifully produced like any prestige show

Yep. I still can't believe not a single big site did weekly recaps of it, but guess they also just went along with the it's Cinemax so who cares thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, so great to have the guy back doing excellent work.

Though to be fair, I don't actually know if I ever felt he really went away, since I haven't seen several of his very unpopular films like Last Airbender, The Happening and After Earth.

I'm thinking about giving them a shot though.

If you haven't seen The Visit btw, that one is also worth checking out. Even lower budget than Split, but solid little horror flick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been quite a while since I watched the show, so I could be wrong, but I always felt the word spiritual was more fitting than religious, because it doesn't seem to be strictly speaking about any one religion, but more about things like the nature of faith and such.

Damon Lindelof's latest show, The Leftovers, feels the same way to me.

It's fine and dandy that people want representation and all that, but on occasion it seems to be less about good stories, interesting characters and visuals, the actual point, and a lot more about real world issues.

The 100 debacle is a good example of a case where no once seemed to care about the actual show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really no. Art/entertainment can do many things. It can be fun, but it can also be horrific. Or silly, or whatever.

Son of Saul is a great film, probably a masterpiece. But so is Life of Brian.

Black Mirror isn't a feel good show, so yeah I'd say they have managed to do what they set out to do.

	<TEXT> I have always felt the Fargo theme is a little more broad than that. To me it's about something like Evil. Both the banal small kind of evil and the demonic insane throwing people in a wood chipper evil.

The animals thing in the film makes me think they were trying to say something about how these things are inside all of us, even if we're Minnesota nice.

Or maybe the Coens just found it all funny. Who knows with those two... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was at least two things.

In the spirit of the time period, the late seventies were really big UFO times (the same reason they used split screen) and it was an homage to the Coen's and their odd sensibilities, The Man Who wasn't There specifically.

I thought it was a wonderful choice and it's not like it came out of nowhere. I could be wrong, but I believe every single episode had hints that aliens were actually flying around in Minnesota. Part of what kickstarts the entire Blumquist storyline was that Rye Gerhadt saw an UFO in episode one.

There may also be some thematic reasons, but I haven't quite figured that part out yet.

	<TEXT>  All that beautiful tension though comes from the fact that I genuinely have no clue what is going to happen at any given moment on Fargo.

At times when they get really close to the Coen's filmography, I could see where the show was going... But then every time they did that, they also threw some little swerve in there to keep me on my toes. Like for instance when they did a riff on the "Look in your heart" scene from Miller's Crossing, or the two kidnappers in a cabin sequences from Fargo. 

It's always done respectfully, but also fresh. It's an impressive balancing act. </TEXT>

They could've gone a much less visually interesting way and it would probably have been accepted, but as a huge fan of the Coens, I enjoy that they actually respect that their films are often designed and structured around imagery, sound, music and all that stuff. </TEXT>
