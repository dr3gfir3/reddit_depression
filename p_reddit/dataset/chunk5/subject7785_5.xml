No clue. Been trying to do all my purchases actually on my Steam Machine. I think that helps out the developers/porters making money off a Linux/SteamOS sale.

Huge freaking oversight IMO. Also doesn't appear that Big Picture mode on other operating systems supports ratings nor writing reviews. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used the health app in the past. Didn't like it. Would think bike rides were actually walks. I disabled it and just used Google Fit and that's worked flawlessly.

I don't wear my watch when I sleep and it would always give me wacky sleep results due to that. 

Now pressing the up button pops up a message asking me to turn on Pebble Health. I do not want to turn it on.

Is there a way the button can be useful again? Maybe by seeing my past Timeline? Or have 1 press of the button open an app of my choice like how long press works?
If not is there a way I can roll back the update to the previous version 3? </TEXT>
