	<TEXT> The Ojo de Agua in Ometepe is not hot, by the way.  It's basically a swimming pool with constantly fresh cool water flowing in and out.  I do recommend it, though! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am quiet, too.  I lived in a house with creaky stairs and always found a way to traverse them without making a lot of racket.  My roommate, on the other hand, will be watching TV or playing a game by himself and manage to make loud interjections like "what the fuck!?!?!!!!" or some other nonsense and i have to ask him "Who are you talking to?"
