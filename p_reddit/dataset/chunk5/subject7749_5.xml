	<TEXT> I know what you mean, but I thought he is supposed to me more of a host there not really commentator. He is a good man to keep the whole thing together, but you are right unfortunately he is not really adding good questions. I have to say though, as bad as this tourney is (organizations, schedule, stream, ipad) its still a good group of caster/commentators, I still enjoy the games I can see! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sad thing is, that we need a strong competitor to twitch, but I totally agree this is NOT well planned with all the breaks and no chat etc. But my love for the game is still strong and I really enjoy the games, maybe BO5 would be better to counter the coinflip/RNG (mirror)matches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I never understood in this whole discussion is the notion of intolerance. Sure I understand people got frustrated with claiming NM's in FFXI, but what harm would it bring to implement a few NMs in FFXIV? 
There is always this very loud group of people condemning NMs, but why not just ignore it and let the people, who enjoy them be. Yes FFXIV needs something on the Overworld, call it Treasure Hunts or whatever, give me an incentive to travel, explore   fight with my friends. Give me gear options, give me danger and excitement.

In the end this is a call for more horizontal progression / not instanced   challenging content.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a timing thing as always. Person with yellow marker stands in the ass of the boss mob, waits till it is about to turn and then runs through it. If there is no patch underneath you will get stunned, if there is you can run through with minimal dmg. Two bad things can happen: Either you are too fast going through the boss (before he is turning), then your tanks get eaten or you are too slow and you are getting eaten. But trust me, everyone can do it, its a matter of a few seconds, just try it out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 485 is still fine for me in t7, but I would aim for 495-500 for later turns. Of course it depends on rear/flank/front. I missed a few hits with 475 in t6 on the main boss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Guys,

Karu here from Eventually, a social / progress orientated FC from Odin. We are atm around 100 Members strong and we are always looking for new active members to play with.
The core of our FC came from Exquisite FTW and recently we acquired players from HERO and CG, to complete our rosters.

At this moment we have 4 weekly active raid teams (2 are done with T5, 2 are working on it) and we are trying to build the 5th one.

We have a lot of fun, a TS3 Server and a Medium House with everything in it!

So if you are seeking a good mixture of players from all over the world, come to us :) You can visit us [here](http://eventually-fc.com) and talk ingame with me or other members, to get more information.

Cheers,

Karu Pika </TEXT>
