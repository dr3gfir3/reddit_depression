	<TEXT> i'm copy-pasting my own comment from another thread, but *this* is what this refers to:

https://np.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/60mz0y/manafort_and_yanukovych_laundered_money_through/

I posted this to /r/ukrainianconflict, it's in Russian, but here a couple of the paragraphs:

The author of this investigation managed to obtain documents which confirm payments from Yanukovych to Manafort using off-shore jurisdictions and banks of dubious reputation.

The documents themselves point to the payments to Manafort being entailing money laundering and scams using payments systems; this is a criminal offence in the United States. 

Then follow a bunch of scans of documnets, quite a few in English. 

They are followed by this:

That is, according to documents, Manafort was not engaged in consulting Yanukovych, but in trade and the buyer of his goods was a Belize offshore company with an account in the Central Asian capital Bishkek. That is a rather non-common channel for laundering money, but sources have said that Kyrgyzstan was frequently used by the Party of Regions [Yanukovych's pro-Russian political party] for these goals. This country was chosen as it is on the periphery and has unstable leadership making it more difficult to investigate.  

"Computer sales" were the cover for these payments. 

 The contract for the sale of the computers is signed by Manafort himself. One can examine the authenticity of his signature by comparing it to signatures on documents available on the US Justic Ministry website. One must first look under the section for lobbyists in the interests of foreign clients (FARA) and find the registration documents for the Davis Manafort company. 

The article ends with this:

Now, after obtaining this Manafort contract, there are groundss to begin a criminal investigation in both Ukraine and in the United States. Since the "laundering" of money in Kyrgyzstan arrived on Manfort's account open in Wachovia Bank in the state of Virginia and the transaction itself was in American dollars, falling under the jurisdiction of the FBI. 

The author of these lines is prepared to give help in uncovering the schemes of corruption in which Yanukovych and his circles are participants. 

The fact that the payments to Manafort could contain a slow-ticking time-bomb was know to or suspected by Russian president Putin. In the autumn of last year, as reported in the dossier from the former special agent, Putin secretly met with ex-president Yanukovych to discuss eveidence f Paul Manafort receiving payments from the Party of Regions. 

"Yanukovuch assured Putin that there were no documented traces which would show payments to Manafort, though Putin told his circle that he did not believe the Ukrainian president", the dossier reads. 

As it turned out, Yanukovych lied again - but this time not to the Ukrainian people, but to his Kremlin protector.

	<TEXT> And then you have people like me, living in Ukraine who have always known Manafort was behind pro-Russian Yanukovych and damn was it a huge red flag when Manafort - who had been quiet since the Maydan - suddenly popped up as Trump's campaign chief. 

Nothing in the news about Trump-Russia since that day has surprised me. Infuriated me? Yes. Surprised me? No.

	<TEXT> i'm going to go way off on a tangent here, but this is fascinating. 

Someday "would of" is quite likely to become accepted. Spoken language moves faster than written language. 

I mean, there was likely a time when "don't" was seen as incorrect. (Except I think no-one cared back then) and proper 'would of' been "Do not". "Don't" simply being the "phoneticized version" of "do not". 

also, someday "couldn't" will shrink to "coon't" and later to "cunt". </TEXT>

Thing is, what do you say to someone accusing you of manipulation when you know damn sure you are samrter than them? *Anything* you say in reply is going to manipulate them. 

Confess? yes, I've been manipulating you - "SEE, THERE YOU GO AGAIN!"

Take offence? I'm really not that type of person. "YES YOU ARE, YOU"RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME!!"

Simply say nothing? ... "DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT! I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR THAT AGAIN!"

Because guess what, the buck stop with the voters. You can cry all day long about how Hillary sabotaged Sanders if that is what you really believe, but when it came time to put your money (YOUR FUCKING VOTE) where your mouth is, if you voted for Trump ro did not vote at all THIS SHIT IS ON YOU.

	<TEXT> thing is, i bet bannon plans to use this to primary the GOP to death.

i mean, if bannon( ostensibly trump) can get the health care law labelled republican, they can primary in whomever they want as an "outsider" to replace "the corrupt GOP". It will play like "Make the GOP great again".

And Dems would have a helluva hard time compting against that. It's a damn good reason to be very fearful of the mid-term elections. 

There may well be a rout of the GOP establishment, but it very well could end happening because of a neo-Tea Party on steroids.  </TEXT>

So, give me some numbers. For example, there were 2,200 heart transplants in the US in 2005. How cheap do they need to be so that anyone of these people could pay for it on their own, or with help from friends and family (and maybe church), so that they don't need insurance? </TEXT>

Janice Phelps, a 60-year-old disabled factory worker in Evansville, Indiana, knows how expensive healthcare is.

Each month, shots for her severe asthma cost $3,000. Quarterly injections for knee pain cost $3,200. Medication for depression costs $900. 

Clearly, once Ryan ends health insurance as a thing, she will have to kick habit of buying 55 iPhone 7Pluses a year.

	<TEXT> Of course every child deserves a home and a childhood. But probably the city, rather than the school district should be working on that.

The school district is going the extra mile with the showers and washing machines. I don't think it is fair to then say "But you need to give them homes, too!"

This school should be lauded for addressing a need in its system - in the schools. These kids need to feel normal at school. They won't smell as bad and the other students won't bully/ignore them so much because they will fit in better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This district is deep Mormon country. They have to be faced with "missionaries". Seriously. Get groups of 12-18 good-looking (and at least 80% of them white) 19-22 year old young men and women. dress them up in white shirts and modest dresses and canvas that district door-to-door from now until election day politly asking people to think about why they vote the way they do.

Have pamphlets ready, maybe some feel-good TV spots. 

Set up a Super PAC to fund this "mission" and you know, there is a fair chance it could work.

But the message has to be taken door-to-door by true believers if there is to be any hope of converting these Mormons.

So, really Reagan was correct. He said: "We the people are the problem". 

And now it is time to say "We the people are the solution".

	<TEXT> thanks. 

on the spoiler thing, the way the page was moving for me when i clicked the link to your comment made it look like the link was opening to show the comment like some subs have so that people don't inadvertantly read spoilers. 

i have to admit it is interesting seeing America wake up to this. I live in Ukraine, so the moment Manafort - who has the reputation over here of enabling dictators - was in Trump's campaign, I was like "oh, it's clear what he is going to do there". Every time Maddow said "we really didn't know at the time why the campaign changed the platform/at the time it seemed there was no explanation", i was like "well, i know you're not following ukraine that closely, but yeah, i could have told you what to look for last summer".

now all i can say is thank god for christopher steele.

Also, I like how you did the "spoiler" thing. which reminds me, when does the real game of thrones start its season this year? I mean, I'm working under the assumption that the white house is doing what it's doing simply to keep us entertained until GoT returns. And then when we have the real GoT, they can take Washington back to being normal, right? *right?*
