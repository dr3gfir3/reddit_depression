	<TITLE> The Rampart Scandal in the 90s: LA Police Corruption </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-01 18:13:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "The LAPD Rampart scandal refers to widespread corruption in the Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) anti-gang unit of the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division in the late 1990s. More than 70 police officers either assigned to or associated with the Rampart CRASH unit were implicated in some form of misconduct, making it one of the most widespread cases of documented police misconduct in United States history, responsible for a long list of offenses including unprovoked shootings, unprovoked beatings, planting of false evidence, frameups, stealing and dealing narcotics, bank robbery,perjury, and the covering up of evidence of these activities.

The New Rampart Police Station

The Rampart investigation, based mainly on statements of CRASH officer Rafael Prez, also known as Ray Lopez, an admitted corrupt policeman, initially implicated over 70 officers of wrongdoing. Of those officers, enough evidence was found to bring 58 before an internal administrative board. However, only 24 were actually found to have committed any wrongdoing, with 12 given suspensions of various lengths, 7 forced into resignation or retirement, and 5 terminated.

As a result of the probe into falsified evidence and police perjury, 106 prior criminal convictions were overturned"

When you take it into context, someone had to be aware that this behaviour was ongoing.  And in the back of jurors mind, they got to be thinking, well if cops could frame people in those hundreds of other cases, why not OJ, the cop did admit to framing OJ on tape, so why not?

OJ Simpson Didn't Do It is a new subreddit that will explore facts, theories and other suggestions that explain why the public should keep an open mind about the accused that is Orenthal James Simpson. Sure, the verdict was "not guilty," but to most of the world, he still "did it".

I personally believe OJ is not the killer. I've done a considerable amount of research (unlike 95% of the people out there who are quick to judge after being consumed by the media). However, a part of me does believe that OJ knows something about what really went on the night of the murders. For whatever reason, Simpson most-likely keeps his mouth shut to protect not only himself, but also his family and friends.

For the record, I'm not black (sorry to be so blunt), but I just wanted to point that out, since there's a lot of "all black people think he's innocent" or "the jury was mostly black which is why he was set free" stuff going on. To me, I believe in the truth, which bares no color.
Unless you've thoroughly watched the whole trial and have done some research outside the mainstream media, nobody has the right to say "He did it." Same goes for any other case.

Plain and simple. Still, not the smartest move for OJ (since he agreed), but when you have financial obligations, you do immoral things.  Quote: "Hey, they offered me $600,000 not to dispute that I [wrote] the book." He said, "That's cash." I said, "They're going to think you wrote it." He said, "So? Everybody thinks I'm a murderer anyway. They're not going to change their mind just because of a book."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The murder of Ron and Nicole was among a string of murders of people associated with O.J., Ron, and Nicole. Casimir Sucharski, a friend of O.J., was murdered two weeks after Ron and Nicole. On March 19, 1995 O.J.'s friend, record company promoter Charles Minor, was murdered. On July 30, 1993, eleven months before the famous double murder, Ron Goldman's friend Brett Cantor was killed with a knife in a manner identical to Ron and Nicole: from behind and across the throat and stabbed repeatedly on the arms and chest. Michael Nigg, a waiter at the Mezzaluna (Ron Goldman was also a waiter there) was shot in the head and killed. Another Mezzaluna waiter barely survived a car bombing.

	<TEXT> O.J. trial judge Lance Ito was reportedly in a position to know what the double murders were really all about. His wife, L.A. Police Captain Margaret York, has been in charge of investigating police department corruption. Captain York reportedly knew of the other police brass as the corrupt secret owners/operators of the fast food sites, formerly O.J.'s businesses (Did O.J. still retain an interest?).

	<TEXT> Norman Pardo, Simpson's former manager, told the Huffington Post the book was written by a ghostwriter without Simpson's involvement. Rather, Simpson had accepted, against Pardo's advice, $600,000 from the publisher ReganBooks and its parent company NewsCorp to say he had written the book and to conduct an associated TV interview.[3] Pardo told the Huffington Post that Simpson had rationalized:[2]

"Hey, they offered me $600,000 not to dispute that I [wrote] the book." He said, "That's cash." I said, "They're going to think you wrote it." He said, "So? Everybody thinks I'm a murderer anyway. They're not going to change their mind just because of a book."

I have saved thousands of dollars with my own remedies (rice, boiled chicken), and they have worked each time.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It only has Lo Meng (from what I remember). And I think for a film to qualify as a "Venoms" film, it has to have 2 or more (I believe) in absolute starring roles. Several films are usually labeled as "Venoms" films, such as "Chinatown Kid," "Heaven and Hell," the "Brave Archer" series, and "Ten Tigers from Kwantung". The reason they're not is because these movies were either vehicles for other actors (i.e. Fu Sheng in "Chinatown Kid"), or they were films with multiple lead actors (i.e. "Ten Tigers from Kwantung"). Otherwise, a film like "Soul Brothers Of Kung Fu" would be a "Venoms" film. hehe But honestly, I've seen "Five Element Ninjas" advertised many times as a "Venoms" film. But for the sake of the article, I just decided to be keep it as real as possible to what a REAL Venoms film is. </TEXT>
