	<TEXT> Back when I was 5, I was sure our neighbour was getting in our trash cans.  So I told my dad and he told me to booby trap the can so we'd know if they were.  He said this because he figured 5 year old me was an idiot.  I went outside for an hour, and came up with a plan.  I duct taped a few party poppers to the top of the can and and then ran all those strings together and looped it around the bar so when they pulled the can open its party time.  The next day our neighbour, who was 70, opened our can and was so startled she had to goto the hospital. Also because I used too much duct tape the party poppers exploded into the garbage and set the can on fire.  I had to pay for a new trash can out of my allowance.  Our neighbour was fine, btw.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always stood by this game and said it was better than GTA IV.  Now im replaying GTA IV and im unsure which game is truly better.  On one hand, GTA V did most of the gameplay better than IV but IV had a better story and mini games.  It's really hard to pick.  Niko was a great character but so was Trevor.  
  
The only real advantage is V with its lack of tutorials.  I swear nothing is more annoying than playing 2/3rds of game and still getting tutorial missions.  </TEXT>

One of the greatest games ever made.  The gold standard amongst RPG's.  It has side missions more complex and amazing than some main storylines. It will keep you surprised throughout the story and it could take you 2 to 3 months to beat it at a fair clip.  If you take your time it could be next year before you finish.  No, im not kidding.  I know this sounds hyperbolic as fuck, but im actually underselling it. It is literally one of the best games ever made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boss said this exact same thing about his truck.  He bought an $80,000 dollar Chevy Diesel.  It's literally the best truck ever.  I drove it a few time for him.  One of our customers in Dodge bought this year's model.  Same color, same packages, same tire size and rims.  He came back almost furious that it happened and said now he's going to have to buy a new truck. </TEXT>

Why would anyone preorder for full price when you can easily get a significant discount?

	<TEXT> Actually, no it wouldn't have been.  During the production of Avengers 1 Joss Whedon wanted to include Spider-Man because hes a fan of the character.  So they put in two optional Spidey cameo's into the script.  The first was when Tony Stark falls, Sony wouldn't allow them to use the character but they tried to bend over backwards to make it happen.  The second was Oscorp, which Sony actually said they could include in the film.  It wasn't in the movie because Sony drug their feet so long that the skyline FX was already completed by the time they got approval.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I bet Microsoft got a discount considering they ordered 60min of footage for Halo 2 and im sure some of these shots cost a lot more than others.  It was just averaged at 1 million per minute. Blur did motion capture for every human in the cutscenes, which is expensive because you have to pay for actors, craft services, medical, stunt teams... etc.  They also had to essentially create new textures and models for everything because that wouldn't be available at the high level they would require. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, they do some great fights.  The problem is they let the directors have free reign over the direction of their episode.  Which means some of the episodes are weaker in that department.  Some people just can't direct action.  Also its a TV show which means they are always filming against the clock.

That said, Curtis is still annoying.  I actively hope hes killed when ever hes in danger.  Felicity is essentially a time remnant from Season 2 now. She never mentions their relationship or acts like her and Oliver dated at all.  It's just gone, like it didn't happen.  I think there was literally one short scene in 17 episodes that had anything to do with their relationship and even that was handled with more care than Season 4. </TEXT>

The last straw was when the dialog option I selected resulted in both characters talking to each other with no sound, then I spent 20 minutes trying to find Sam Node because the waypoint system is really hard to follow.  After I found Sam Node the game glitched so hard the game crashed.  Thats when I uninstalled the trial.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The quality is bad because Bioware built a team to make Mass Effect instead of doing it at Edmonton.  They also lost several key players from the original trilogy, including Casey Hudson. Even though everyone keeps pointing at the janky ass animations and glitches, the writing is also weak as hell which should be the biggest issue here.  During the trial, a Krogan shrugged away the Genophage like it wasn't a big deal and happily works for a racist Salarian whose behavior made his entire clan leave.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This movie was shot with RED's new "Weapon 8K" camera system.  A 6K Camera was used for the Airport fight during Civil War.  That scene was a test to see if these new camera systems would be viable for an entire production.  If you remember the Airport Fight in IMAX then you'll get an idea at how fucking amazing this movie will look. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly, James Gunn downloaded the 50 most popular songs from the 70's and listened to them as he worked on the script / film.  Its why that movie had such great song choices.  The sequel won't be any different.  I still can't believe they used Fleetwood Mac for a trailer, I don't think I would ever hear that song mainstream.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So many neat things that I forgot about since GTA 5 was released.
  
I love how the Auto Target allows you to specifically aim while you are still locked on.  Popping out from cover and shooting someone in the head is just so much fun.  
  
I love how realistic the car crashes are in this game.  You can drive full tilt into a road block and slam the car out of your way.  You can also push morons out of the road.  Its also great that the doofuses get out of the car when you crash like we're going to exchange insurance info.   
  
I love how the animations are much more realistic when you drive over people.  You can hit them and stop and watch them roll, then when they get up you can do it again.
  
I love how mean the vendors are at Burger Shot.  I got a burger last night and the guy said "Fuck you Fatty!" when he handed it to me.  I also love how I finished my burger and shot that fucker in the face for calling me fat.  
  
I also love how the cops will warn you that you're speeding with their siren and the pedestrians will react realistically to your manic behaviour.  
  
Its also great that the cops will actually try to arrest you over just killing you. </TEXT>

Also is Dragon Age : Inquisition a good game?  I noticed it was on there, never played a Dragon Age game before.   </TEXT>
