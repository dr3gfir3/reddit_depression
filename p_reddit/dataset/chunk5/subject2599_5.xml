	<TEXT> Again, sorry.

But elections have consequences. Even if that means puppies, kittens and a minority of people voted a different way, or didn't vote at all, are affected by their decisions or apathy.

What's your alternative? No one is *ever* held accountable for their political actions? That's *crazy*.

I don't take any pleasure in, say, what will happen to our health care system after the GOP pulls their Remove   Replace (With Nothing). Let alone our never having a state option for Single Payer back when ACA was being ironed out. And the Red States are going to be **so** screwed by the GOP on this, worse than us. That sucks!

But what's the alternative? These states asking the Blue States, the major population centers, to pay for their screw-ups? ~~That doesn't seem fair.~~ Oh, wait, that's what they already do. 

Well, no more. Let every person lie in the bed they make. If you don't like your bed, make a new one. Or move to a different bed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One can walk and chew gum at the same time.

The simple fact is, big picture things like CalPERS **should** represent its CA employees, who overwhelmingly favor measures to mitigate Global Warming.

And, local reps  like Kaplan and others  doing non-time-intensive things like this get press, which increases awareness, which creates pressure on CalPERS.

"The people, and public workers, of California, should not in any way finance, support, or allow our money to be used for the destructive Dakota Access Pipeline," Kapland said in a statement today. "The pipeline proposal not only threatens the health of the planet and the safety of the drinking water, it also represents a horrifying example of environmental racism."

Since we are capable of masticating while ambulating, a more germane question to ask is, What the Hell is CalPERS thinking to begin with, supporting the fossil fuel industry, harmful projects and Donald Trump's agenda?

The City of Oakland's employees are members of the CalPERS pension system, and the city pays millions a year into their pensions. Billions of CalPERS funds are invested in oil and gas companies, but the pension system was ordered in 2015 by state lawmakers to divest from thermal coal due to its role in increasing global CO2 emissions.

CalPERS, the state's giant public-employee retirement system, has invested $57 million in Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline. The retirement system also owns Sunoco bonds worth $1.8 million. Sunoco and ETP recently merged. The pension also owns approximately $242 million of ConocoPhillips stock, a major oil company that is directly backing construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. </TEXT>

Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald and Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed join Jeremy Scahill for a discussion on the crazy apocalyptic present in which we find ourselves. 

They break down Trumps attacks on the media, that insane speech he gave at the CIA, and the state of the Democratic Party. Naomi Klein sends in a dispatch from the Womens March against the Trump-Pence administration about whats at stake for people who are not men. Jeremy goes deep into the secretive world of Seymour Hershs kitchen and shoots the shit with the legendary, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist about why he calls Trump a circuit breaker for the two-party system. And we hear a spoken-word performance from hip-hop artist Immortal Technique.

And from /u/Piemonkey's [*excellent* observation](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/5q4m80/uanzai_explains_in_detail_why_the_alternative/dcwew00/):

It's a common tactic that goes like this:  
Them: *statement*  
You: Argument against *statement*  
Them: Evidence!  
You: Okay, here it is.  
Them: lol all lies  
And then they basically ask you for more evidence without providing any of their own at all, in the hopes that eventually you'll give up or make a mistake so they can jump all over you, without ever once responding to the initial disagreement of their statement.  

We've veered far enough from privacy related issues for me to continue. Back to the original topic: *1984* is the #1 bestselling book on Amazon as I type this. Have a great day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny, since even the WH spokesperson said, expect a month or more.

Do you have any cites from reputable sources of the Obama administration muzzling our government agencies for a month-plus like the current one has. If you claim it, let's see them.

It's instructive *which* departments have had a gag rule imposed on them: basically any concerning public safety, health or globally-impacting science. It's no accident.

If you bother to click thru to the article, you'll see why this administrative response against departments that, after all, we **all** pay for, is worrying:

A wholesale clampdown on public information would pose risks, said Steve Lenkart, the executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees.

"I would advise this new administration to tread lightly when ordering any increase of secrecy of government operations or policies," he said. "The American people expect an open, transparent and honest government"

Those concerns were compounded on Inauguration Day, when the Interior Department ordered a shutdown of all its Twitter accounts after the National Park Service retweeted photos showing a substantially smaller crowd at Trumps swearing-in than had greeted Obama in 2009. Interiors Twitter service was restored the next day, but only after the park service deleted the offending tweets and apologized.

The environment *used* to be a bi-partisan interest, and currently has *amazingly* solid support across the entire electorate. Against the *one* report that the Bush Administration published, there are multiple, entrenched threats the EPA has changed for the better over the past decades: [Acid Rain, DDT, leaded gasoline and air pollution](http://grist.org/article/here-are-4-big-pollution-problems-epa-has-mostly-fixed-already/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The **Bush Era** EPA? **A** report?

Okay. One rushed and erroneous report, probably/possibly pushed for political motives or possibly a bureaucratic screw-up. **A** report.

Versus [silencing *every* department](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/federal-agencies-trump-information-lockdown-234122), the Oval Office *directly* ordering the EPA to not talk to anyone outside their department but instead refer them to Trump's hand-picked spokesperson, especially if they work for *our* media.

Federal agencies are clamping down on public information and social media in the early days of Donald Trump's presidency, limiting employees ability to issue news releases, tweet, make policy pronouncements or otherwise communicate with the outside world, according to memos and sources from multiple agencies.

The steps to mute federal employees  seen to varying degrees in the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of the Interior, Transportation, Agriculture and Health and Human Services  are sparking early fears of a broader crackdown across the government, as Trump vows to pursue an agenda sharply at odds with his predecessor.

Your false analogy is very false. And uhh, at worst, shows Republicans are hostile to the notion that the American people are entitled to clean air, water and land. Or even deserve to know the truth about what they breathe, drink and eat.

Bonus Question: Which party blocked funds to 9/11 First Responders for *years* until many people, including Jon Stewart, pushed many times, including on-air, to have our Congress do the right thing? Is that better, or worse, than a single report done once during the Bush Administration?  </TEXT>

Flash is horribly insecure with "must-fix" zero-day bugs that crop up almost every other day. This is another vulnerability, since its another thing that must be updated (and not everyone does this). Plus it's closed source, so gods know what else it's doing. And, most of the toxic ad-based malware relies on Flash. Finally, it's awful on battery use.

Besides that, Flash is *great!* ;)

	<TEXT> Yay! All hail /u/Erktheerk! And his modesty and sharing credit!

And for new lurkers, this is something /r/Privacy veterans are more prone to do: I left out specifically who was involved doing a specific task, letting them come forward if they liked. Giving them control over what of themselves they'd like others to know.

See, it's not that we don't share, or aren't open. But rather, we think folks should be the ones to choose how much to disclose.

30K posts is a lot, and a lot of work. A question I'd have is, would the utility be worth it? Would a Sub with open, general posting be likely to have the vast majority of posts correctly flaired? It seems to be that high percentages would be needed for filters to reliably work  is say 85% or higher realistic?

Are there better uses of our precious time? 

I'm not suggesting answers, but posing questions we'd want to consider. :)

_____

Edit: another thing to consider, is Bots can be kinda dumb. Or we're inconsistent hairless monkeys that are too random for our machine overlords to categorize. "Lavabit Announces Return With New Open Source Service". Is it Crypto? Email? Internet? Business? Surveillance? Political? It's kind of, all of the above. And many titles stymie keywords, so Bots will cry.

We are able to make a decent go of things at /r/NSALeaks, but that's with 6-odd submitters, all motivated to make our Flair system work since we know many of our subscribers like screening for categories. And, if more than 10-ish percent of the stories aren't tagged, then these stories won't show up.

It's stuff like this that all the Mods of all Subs wrestle over  there are often no right answers, just better ones for each Sub. :) </TEXT>

The thing about that is, even with Bots, it'll be your humble Moderators who are manually doing this. That's a **huge** chore, and ask.

We like the idea, believe me. But the logistics get painful.

For instance, I also moderate a curated Sub, /r/NSALeaks. So, no one but Mods can post. Great quality control of the articles. But even us? Forget to apply Flairs more than we should. And we have *really* crackjack Mods who are Bot/Script wizards.

We have three Mods here (which we like: folksy!) Volunteering their time. So, we know they'd be great. *We* think they'd be great. But it'll be a lower priority than other things we do. :) </TEXT>

* using proper passwords to secure your accounts

The F.B.I. is also examining the allegations in that dossier, and a summary of its contents was provided to Mr. Trump earlier this month.

Representatives of the agencies involved declined to comment. **Of the half-dozen current and former officials who confirmed the existence of the investigations, some said they were providing information because they feared the new administration would obstruct their efforts.** All spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the cases.

OK. That's not scary. Not at all.

	<TEXT> American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American officials said.

The continuing counterintelligence investigation means that Mr. Trump will take the oath of office on Friday with his associates under investigation and after the intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government had worked to help elect him. As president, Mr. Trump will oversee those agencies and have the authority to redirect or stop at least some of these efforts.

You know, in a different situation, the irony of the current director of J. Edgar Hoovers FBI helping deliver the White House to partial Kremlin control would be delicious.

	<TEXT> I sometimes get the sense that /r/Apple attracts a lot of people who are Android trolls (for iOS-related posts) and Windows trolls (for MacOS posts). Sometimes, but more rarely, Hackintosh trolls.

I've seen these *looooong* chains form where folks extoll, in lavish detail, the "amazing" benefits of Android or Windows. 

*Always* prefaced with, "As a long-time Mac (iPhone) user, I've recently come to the conclusion that"

Then of course if I point out I come to /r/Apple to read about, well, Apple products, the usual "Apple fanboy" responses fly (with down votes, which I never care about).

I suppose we should be honored that folks using other platforms waste their time and effort here, but it's boring. And distracting. And sometimes results in flames which *Yawn*.

So, if pruning any conversations that seem more an excuse to hype Android or Windows  when perfectly good Subs exist for this  is something Mods are considering, I'd be okay with it. </TEXT>

Oops! Case dismissed!

This trend of anti-protest legislation dressed up as obstruction bills is deeply troubling, said Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, who views such bills as violations of the First Amendment. A law that would allow the state to charge a protester $10,000 for stepping in the wrong place, or encourage a driver to get away with manslaughter because the victim was protesting, is about one thing: chilling protest. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What's the proper work flow for editing a picture in Photos, across multiple devices </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-19 20:43:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I love Photos. I have a Mac and a iPad. I use the latter to take photos but also import photos from my camera to my desktop. I use my Mac to back up and syndicate changes, not iCloud. Although, I have shared galleries I use iCloud for, but not for auto backup.

A couple versions ago, I'd edit a photo and the changes would take place across all my devices. Now, it's more complicated and I find when I edit a photo, it doesn't necessarily propagate. I'm stuck with an old photo and the newly edited one, either in one of my devices or in one of the dizzying number of groups that Photos creates: 

* Photos

* All Photos

* My Photo Stream

* Any of the local iPhoto Events galleries

* Any shared iCloud gallery I've created

* Plus the newer algorithm ones like Faces, Selfies, Moments, etc.

* *Argh.*

So, if I want to make a single edit to a single photo then have these changes take effect across all these groups, across all my devices, which one do I edit? The one in Photos? All Photos? Which?

Bonus Q: I've noticed sometimes when I add a photo to a gallery, it is no longer in one of the groups. *Why?* I simply want to *add* a photo to a gallery, not *replace* it.

PS: If this post belongs in /r/Apple, let me know. I'll cheerfully move it. Or if someone has already written up a decent guide on fathoming this, feel free to refer me to it. :)

PS: Besides this quirk, I *like* Photos (I also like Photoshop  different tools for different uses). So let's not make this a *DAE Hate The Photos App?* thread. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The highlighted part is new. Or, new to me:

Facebook does not deny that there is a vulnerability that can be used to wiretap targeted conversations by, for example, governments with access to WhatsApps servers. And **despite WhatsApps recent public statements, the vulnerability cannot be avoided by verifying fingerprints or checking a checkbox in the WhatsApp settings.**

Am I off? I recall Facebook, WhatsApp and even Moxie saying, No worries, its a design/preference choice, easily corrected if youre privacy-conscious.

Yet, Tobias Boelter writes,

Using WhatsApp [after you've replaced your lost/damaged phone], your friends phones are instructed to automatically re-encrypt and retransmit any messages that havent been delivered. But they dont know if they are sending messages to you or the government. Then, and only if your friends specifically asked WhatsApp to do so, they will see a warning after delivering the messages that there couldve been something shady going on. 

Signal on the other hand will tell your friends something like: There mightve been something shady going on. Do you want to resend your message?

But how often do those situations [losing/replacing a phone] really occur? Id say not that often. </TEXT>

I'm a Mod there.

A link to [our ad is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/51yomr/rprivacy_ad_v3_3rd_is_the_charm/)

I can't think of any longer term issue affecting Redditors than the issue of privacy, required to develop as people, as we share our evolving, uncensored thoughts with peers. Except for cats, but I don't mod /r/kittehpictures.

We're a busy Sub but we're very rigorous in keeping the tone and quality high, with no personal horribleness, promotion or flames. We put special care in ensuring newbies are welcome and encouraged to ask all the "stupid" questions we asked when we were in their position. And we're very glad to see neophytes become more aware of how to empower themselves and others as they learn more about being private while engaging in our digital (and physical!) worlds. We're also fortunate to have many experts and some journalists covering the digital security beat who contribute. We *really* work hard to be a home for both kinds of people.

We humbly think Reddit will become a better place as more people become aware of how to protect themselves and those they care for living in our digital world. We'd like to think /r/Privacy contributes to this. We'd like to contribute more.

	<TEXT> A concern with Threema is that it's not Open Source and auditable, for what it's worth. But it has a decent rep and EFF gives it 6/7.

Signal is tricky since it requires phone numbers, but it doesn't log any activity worth anything.

Assuming transit to ProtonMail is secure enough for both parties (if true anonymity is needed, then Tor; is the device safe, is it shared? Are VPNs used, etc), then ProtonMail is secure. I *believe* the meta data is protected by the PM folks via their ideology and Swiss location. Check on this on their site, though.

Bluetooth threats exist because BT is enabled *and* the accessory comms may be intercepted. So best practices would be to turn off BT when not actively using an ear bud or keyboard, say.

That said, the BT protocol supports encryption and newer devices (iPhone 7, say) have further modules making it even tougher to crack. 

It's not like plain email, in other words, where it's transmitted in the clear. It would require significant work to hack into. Beyond the reach for most, even most governments, but for say the top 12 ones, if they *really* wanted to? With those kinds of resources, you're safer to avoid most mobile platforms and general-use computers. Total siloing. But we're talking about Snowden Archive level type things.

It's further complicated because you have your writers and site on one hand, and your sources on the other. Different threats, different models.

Have you considered contacting the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press)?

We're getting pretty close to the point where I'm uncomfortable being the sole person you're contacting for protecting you and your sources since worst-case scenario, lives are at stake. You might want to also reach out to media pros who have front line experience protecting journalists and sources, and their life   liberty.

I'm honored. Really. But consider also reaching out to them and/or [EFF](https://eff.org). They have more hands-on experience which is invaluable. 

Oh, and if you do, get back to me (or us via this post). I'd be interested in their feedback on what you've done and the small advice I've given. It'll help us going forward if there are nuances I'm missing. :) </TEXT>

There was a mental slip where I mentally crossed wired concerning using iCloud and iMessages on the first post, but then I corrected it, below.

[Explaining] Crypto is *hard*!

I think that's it? A bit odd since the issues stand, simply substitute the two nouns.

But the main point getting across is my primary objective: 

* Messages' E2E encryption is quite trustworthy,  
* For an added layer of security use local backups on your secure Mac rather than iCloud (losing some convenience).  
* Both are rock-solid to protect from mass surveillance, and  
* Apple is reportedly working on removing themselves from the certification process completely, so soon even iCloud will be totally secure.

Don't mind the down votes, though. It all comes out in the wash. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oops. I misspoke. Messages is E2E and, as you note, that means Apple doesn't have a key, by definition.

iCloud is secure, but Apple needs to see it so they can restore, so it's 2-party. Apple's signing key is all-or-nothing and they won't give it up without Nuclear Winter, dogs laying with cats and quite the kerfuffle. They designed it that way, so that there's no "easy" way to force them (outside a legal demand, judicial review and minimization). *That's* where the theoretical MITM attack comes from, and can be mitigated by notifications. But it's only theoretical.

So using iCloud to store data means you and Apple can access it. There's some nuance in that you can back up some kinds of data but not others. Or not at all. Thus, you can also back up to your local hub computer. No cloud. For those that want that extra level of security, they can do that. If they follow this protocol, they're not vulnerable.

And, it's iCloud that Apple is supposedly working on moving to a zero-knowledge system after the *Apple vs FBI* thing. They realized they need to include themselves as part of the threat model. Then once that's done, backing up Messages to iCloud is no longer a vulnerability. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's fine. There's a theoretical threat in that Apple holds the Crypto key. But it's shared among all 120m+ Message users, so if they give it up for you, they would have to give it up for the others. *Apple vs FBI* proved they won't do that without a Supreme Court hearing. And it doesn't have Perfect Forward Security, which is nice, but not mandatory. Rumors are these are things they're working on.

Don't store your Messages in iCloud. That's a biggie. Which means, you need to back up to your local, secured, drive-encrypted-with-great-password hard drive.

Watch your Apple ID account for any notifications that a new device (that's not yours) has tried gaining access to your account (or conversely that a formerly-blessed device no longer can for no reason). This would indicate the (again, theoretical) threat that someone is trying a man-in-the-middle attack. Unlikely and if it happens, you'll be notified before anything bad can happen.

Besides that, it's good enough unless you're not Laura Poitras, Jeremy Scahill or Glenn Greenwald. </TEXT>

I'd consider having work-related mobile (even desktop) devices and then personal ones since it's often the innocent letting one's guard down while on a Sunday afternoon where one slips. Or at least, compartmentalize on the device, where the Apps and things you only use for work-related things. It's good mental discipline that you need to mentally activate your shields when you're using Signal if it's only used for confidential topics. 

Although, then there's the trade-off that you meta-data is screaming "Look at my Signal Contact List for my sources", so there're always tradeoffs (solved by securing your phone and network).

Let's use your original question, are Bluetooth ear buds safe, to show the value of siloing. Use on a Saturday night out so as you're stumbling around with friends? Sure! On a Tuesday when Deep Throat calls? Nope. And, the thing is, since your other comms *are* pretty secured and your threats *are* significant, Bluetooth might be more attractive to them. So for your situation, I've changed my mind  don't use Bluetooth for work things, only for social things (if that).

But only for work. See  compartmentalizing makes it easier to have a life while being secure. No one can be a monk all the time, so plan around that fact.

TAILS is another option (although painful so it's okay if you hold off on this except rare situations). You don't mention [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview). I might suggest [Tor Messenger](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/10/how-to-use-tor-messenger-the-most-secure-chat-program-around/).

On top of that, WhatsApp whimsically went back on their "iron-clad" promise to not let Facebook into their App's comm streams, which they now do. If advertisers can see what you're texting, so can others.

Avoid Facebook. Avoid WhatsApp. Use Signal (or iMessage which is fine unless you're on the NSA/FSB's crap-list). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A security backdoor that can be used to allow Facebook and others to intercept and read encrypted messages has been found within its WhatsApp messaging service.

Facebook claims that no one can intercept WhatsApp messages, not even the company and its staff, ensuring privacy for its billion-plus users. But new research shows that the company could in fact read messages due to the way WhatsApp has implemented its end-to-end encryption protocol.

Note this doesn't mean Open Whisper Systems' Crypto is busted. Or Signal, which is secure. It's (freaken') Facebook's implementation of Moxie's Crypto suite. 

The security backdoor was discovered by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He told the Guardian: If WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys.

The backdoor is not inherent to the Signal protocol. Open Whisper Systems messaging app, Signal, the app used and recommended by whistleblower Edward Snowden, does not suffer from the same vulnerability. If a recipient changes the security key while offline, for instance, a sent message will fail to be delivered and the sender will be notified of the change in security keys without automatically resending the message.

	<TEXT> Yes, but generally only in a relative sense. 

An eavesdropper would have to be w/in Bluetooth range, with an input device and a way to find which channel you're using, then unlock that encrypted channel. There is certainly a bigger threat profile when using Bluetooth, but there are more likely easier ways to compromise your and your source.

For instance, leaving your phone in your office while meeting a source (when possible) is the best security. No geo-tagging, or any other threats.

If you don't mind, can you give some more details? Who's a likely adversary? What OS are you using? What countries? Do you need voice? App interaction (Signal and the like)? Video? Is it your sole comm channel or are you using your phone as a voice recorder for notes? What alternatives do they have? Do you? </TEXT>

The genome  the final frontier  or just a complex mess of letters? 

Somewhere in there, our eye or skin color is hidden. But also, diseases can be diagnosed or predicted by analyzing the genome. More and more research is committed to finding clues for diseases in our genes. The opportunity is clear: If I know about a disease I might get ahead of time, I could possibly intervene before it starts. Yet: How accurate are these predictions and how meaningful are they? And more importantly: What happens to my genetic data once it has been decoded?

And since it's a video w/o a transcript 

Tell you what. How about I approve it, and you add a new comment explaining what it is, how it affects privacy and the rest? That way, folks will know the context. Bonus points for a time reading where she delves into the privacy aspects (science is great, but we're not /r/askscience)?

	<TEXT> Well, if you click thru to the article, you'll see that Mr Steele  who everyone says has superb contacts in Russia and is a diligent professional  based his report on a variety of sources. One could be off a bit (or even completely wrong) while the other sourced allegations not being affected. Further, one of Trump's other go-to lawyers was in Europe around that timeframe. And, as I'm sure you know, the EU doesn't check passports once you're inside the union, so either of these two gentlemen wouldn't have a Prague stamp in their passport (or digital evidence).

That's the thing about those pesky ethics rules that Trump blew off. People like that think these procedures are to protect the public from Kleptocracies. And they are. But they're also to protect those in public office  so everyone is assured there aren't any conflicts of interest to begin with.

Trump He's released his income taxes by now, hasn't he? Divested himself from Trump Enterprises and put the proceeds in a blind trust? Run by competent executors? Shed those billions of debt he had with all those foreign banks? Stopped taking money from foreigners, like the Constitution prohibits? Pulled away from his silly initial notion that hiring members of his family while in the Oval Office couldn't be nepotism since he is "special"?

Good thing  imagine if he hadn't nipped *those* things in the bud! That's among the best evidence he hasn't been compromised that anyone can hope for!

TL; DR: Ethics rules protect both the office *and* the office-holder. We've been doing this for over two hundred years. We know what works. We know what doesn't. </TEXT>
