	<TEXT> I think if hisoka wins his next target would be ging and that would be what brings him into DC. He's already shown interest in fighting ging.

I think if chrollo wins then he'll come back to the PT and realize that all the money he's sending to meteor city isn't going to the citizens but to the new ruler gyro. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is something I think enhancement could suprisingly.  By touching them you could enhance their pain nerves to where they feel pain even from air resistance. A cool twist from the normally positive type of enhancement we see </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then why can razor emit those nen people? Or Netero his Buddha. Transmutation has nothing to do with shape only property. You can give your transmuted nen a certain shape but transmutation is not the type that defines shape </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not in the least. The shape of the arm has nothing to do with the property it's made of, aka transmutation. Just because Zeno uses transmutation when making his dragon doesn't mean transmutation is a criteria to change shape he's just a Transmuter so it'd be easier for him. Neteros Buddha had a much more specific shape but it's emission so that means the arms can be emitted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Asura would be emission. Look at neteros buddha. Zoro is just emmitting multiple arms and manipulating them. Atleast that's how I look at it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It'll be a while for you to see that specific ability. You're still in the simple part of the show. Don't worry about his ability because if all you do is wonder how these powers are doing what they do it could ruin the fun of the show. Also get off this subreddit!! The show will be ruined for you because we don't consider the show to be spoilers and half the time someone says spoilers it's in the title so get off </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see him seeking out hisoka in some sasuke Itachi shit but I do see him having a few words with illumi eventually. In actuality Gotoh was more of a father than silva so I'm sure Killua is upset enough to tell illumi off if a situation arises </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely see chrollo being spared for the sole reason of his unlimited potential due to his hatsu. He's a skilled fighter who can get endless powerful abilities so he only gets stronger and stronger. Hisoka probably sees chrollo as his perfect fruit. A fruit that never finishes ripening because it's always becoming riper and stronger  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just from the phantom troupe, Phinks could kill him. Phinks whole ability is a one shot or a loss but easily a one shot. Vacuum girl can suck his blood out without him using pain packer.  Nobunaga could kill him with his en sword attack which would just chop his head off (this is presuming that nobu's main power is his speed which is hinted a lot) when feitan attacks. Shalnark COULD, but I think feitan could dodge long enough for shalnark to die, but it's very possible that using auto pilot he could one shot feitan.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time I was with a girl, we weren't even dating yet so I don't know why she said "I love you" anyways. But basically a couple days beforehand she told me she made a mistake and gave another guy a blowjob because "he kept asking and it got annoying" so I was planning on ending it completely anyway because who does that because they got "annoyed". But basically we met up and started talking.  I was planning on ending it once we both had to part ways but she beat me to it. She had to go home so she said "I love you" and kissed me. I softly took her off me and said "that's cool" and walked away. Once she couldn't see my face I grinned so big because I thought it was hilarious. "That's cool" is my worst answer to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Imagine you're put into the world of HXH. To survive and thrive as a hunter you get to choose one hatsu that we've seen someone use that will become yours instead
Examples for what I would choose:

Hatsu-Bungee gum
Owner-Hisoka
Why- It is so unique but is only strong if used by someone intelligent. It has endless options for every situation

Hatsu-Warp Punch
Owner-Leorio
Why- I just really wanna Ora Ora someone from a distance using portals

P.s, try not to pick just an op ability like neteros Buddha. Be interesting and have fun  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's interesting to think. Ging can copy abilities just by figuring them out. I'm not saying I believe this but it's very possible that ging has a way to mass produce nen abilities through those cards and other means. If so then he may be the most formidable person alive  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think either of those have anything to do with one another. It's probably just coincidence. If it wasn't then the two pots would be identical but the difference in them is astounding if it was the same pot. The only similarity is they have faces and are pots.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Name:Magnet Mark

Type: Manipulation

Hatsu: Manipulates the magnetic polarization of something. All materials have a polarization but only metals have the right "frequency" to be affected by magnets normally. By touching an object, person or wall with my hand I can control the polarization of them which can give them magnetism.  Once I touch something the magnetism doesn't go into affect until activated. It's activated by either me saying "Negative" or "positive" to decide if it'll repel or attract other magnets. Or it has a preset polarization that is activated when another object with polarization touches it.Cannot control my own polarization. But let's say I touch my enemy and then touch a wall behind me. I can set their magnetic  polarization to be the same, pushing him away from the wall/me, or opposite where he is attracted to that area. In a close room scenario this can be very powerful by touching different parts of the room and the the opponent. Could entrap opponent by surround them with magnets all pushing against them making them similar to a paintball machine

Restrictions: I have to say out loud what each marked things polarization is. The pull or repel is stronger the closer I am to it. So if my enemy is stuck to a wall once I leave it'll be weak enough for them to get out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone saying gon has natural zetsu it still doesn't make sense. Kalluto,  an advanced nen user, used their best zetsu yet hisoka was instantly able to tell he was hiding. To me this seems just like something that wasn't thought all the way through by togashi which happens to all writers. Also I'm sure someone will say that because of his bloodlust he couldn't sense gon. Throughout the entire series when hisoka had blood lust he was keener and more focused on his environment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Leorio is the same level as them when they were creating their hatsu. He already has a hatsu. I think the fact that he had a pretty powerful ability makes up for gon and killuas talent for that time. He's not even close to gon and Killua during chimera arc but compared to greed island Killua and gon I think he's around that level. Leorio isn't a joke character in the manga like he is in the anime. Leorio isn't a weakling, he's just not as naturally talented as those two </TEXT>
