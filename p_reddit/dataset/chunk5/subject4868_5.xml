	<TEXT> Hahaha, you beat me to the exact quote I was going to post.

I would definitely not call conservative ideology drawn from wisdom. It's the opposite of wisdom. It's drawn from a narrow life perspective closed off from outside perspectives and influences. 

Liberalism, is drawn from a multi-generational, multi-perspective place. And takes into account human nature. And even attempts to regulate for human nature. And it's that attempt which annoys and infuriates conservatives. We try to protect them from themselves and they resent it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a few points come to mind.

First, the article mentions Denmark, which was just voted as the happiest country on Earth. They don't have to despair if they miss a single paycheck or get sick or lose their job.

Second, I'm always reminded of the Tea Party rallies of years past where we could see gun-toting conservatives carrying signs saying, "Keep your government hands off my medicare". 

Third, a basic income is being piloted around the world in various countries. Results are pending.

Fourth, Alaska has a State fund which is supported by oil revenues and pays a divident to every qualifying citizen of the state, regardless of their employment status. It's value varies year by year.

Programs which are completely socialist in nature are the following: Public schools, medicare, medicaid, social security, SNAP, Section 8 housing, Earned Income Credit, and others.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States

I always heard my parents talk about how they paid into social security and medicare, and now they were getting it back. But that's not an accurate assessment. And the majority of baby boomers didn't understand this. They didn't realize they were paying into a program that was immediately paying out to eligible citizens. Baby boomers also didn't realize the costs for their collection of benefits far exceeded what they paid into programs.

Socialism is an ugly word to many people. Democratic socialism has a meaning to me that If you're making money hand over fist at the expense of someone, or many people, the government can make you pay more in taxes to cover programs which are going to have to cover services for those people.  In other words, if your company lays off 1,000 people, those people will now have to collect either severance pay or more likely unemployment benefits. If those workers are above a certain age, they won't readily find work. Companies already pay into unemployment as part of their taxes. But, what if those workers start losing their houses or getting sick and no longer have the means to pay for services as they did when they were employed? This inevitably happens. Then they might qualify for medicaid or other services. Well medicaid has to be funded. And It needs to provide more services to more people as a direct result of your company laying off workers, and supposedly outsourcing jobs to India where labor is cheaper. I believe that your company should have to pay a tax for outsourcing work to cheaper markets to make up for the burden you've placed on the government by choosing to collect more profits by hiring cheaper labor. There's a finite amount of money in the system. It can't all go to you. If it does, it's at someone else's expense. And not just your fired workers. It reverberates throughout the entire economy as lost revenues to companies who see fewer sales of goods and services because your 1,000 workers suddenly have little to no purchasing power. When you combine this on a larger scale within the entire economy with regards to shifting labor forces overseas to promote your own profit, you can see the effect it has on the entire economy. Third world countries are building a middle class. And our middle class diminishes. That has far reaching effects on the future of business in America. And over time, with diminished purchasing power, Americans get poorer and poorer, and you get more wealthy. Now you have far more than you would have had. And your laid off 1,000 workers, many of whom have fallen into poverty, or gotten sick and died from lack of care, or fell to addiction, won't ever recover to a living standard they once had. But yours has gone up. And since you're so wealthy, you want to keep more of your "hard earned" money. And you start to think, why should I pay for poor people? They should have made better choices. So our society makes better choices concerning the welfare of the people. We say, you should pay more in taxes to cover the services which are required as a direct result of your actions to seek more profit. And you say, it's mine. I don't want to help poor people. They're someone else's problem. So, when that financial crisis hit in 2008, America got downsized. Corporations lost pension plans, and investments, and suddenly corporate purchasing power went down. Banks weren't lending to anyone. And if banks aren't lending, banks can't earn money. And if you can't get business credit, you can't expand, or in some cases, do business. And now your business needs to downsize greatly just to survive. You must scale back to keep your standard of living. But if you do scale back, the market demands won't be met and a competitor could swoop in and steal your share. So the government steps in and provides economic stimulus. This is corporate welfare. Tax dollars going directly to corporate America to keep the gears turning. But as American citizens, we say, we don't want to help poor corporations. They should have made better choices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With all due respect to Dr. Paul, the GOP tried that and fucked them both up. The country is over the GOP agenda. It has become very clear that the GOP priority is to help the wealthiest Americans keep more of their revenues at the expense of the rest of the country. We're not buying what the GOP is selling. Enough is enough. We're taking our country back from the robber barons and trust fund babies and captains of industry. The "free market" is nothing more than a wealth redistribution scheme. Opportunity will return and everyone will be forced to obey the same rules. The American dream will live again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article cites Jeffrey Carr and "other cyberwarfare experts"

Yet as Jeffrey Carr and other cyberwarfare experts have pointed out, this methodology is fatally flawed. Its important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method, writes Carr:

The "Other cyberwarfare experts" article states this:

CrowdStrike, the firm that detected the DNC hack, calls APT 28 Fancy Bear. Until recently, the company's founder, Dmitri Alperovitch, said he had "medium level confidence" that the group was run by the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service. Now, he says the confidence level has changed to high. The increase comes from the finding by CrowdStrike that a Ukrainian-developed Android application, used to simplify targeting data for the D-30 howitzer, was contaminated with a version of APT 28 malware.

https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-22/why-i-still-don-t-buy-the-russian-hacking-story

And this article cites this:

Cybersecurity firm finds evidence that Russian military unit was behind DNC hack.
While CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to investigate the intrusions and whose findings are described in a new report, had always suspected that one of the two hacker groups that struck the DNC was the GRU, Russias military intelligence agency, it had only medium confidence. Now, said CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch, we have high confidence it was a unit of the GRU. CrowdStrike had dubbed that unit Fancy Bear.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cybersecurity-firm-finds-a-link-between-dnc-hack-and-ukrainian-artillery/2016/12/21/47bf1f5a-c7e3-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?utm_term=.a8b12135ba5c

So, this entire article is based on unchecked sources and random headlines. Total nonsense. Is this what passes for journalism these days? You can't cite an article which disproves your thesis and act like you're actually doing work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Dear white people, black people cant be racist. Prejudice, yes, but not racist. Racism describes a system of disadvantage based on race. Black people cant be racist since we dont stand to benefit from such a system."

Sorry, but racism is
prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

or 

the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.

So, it's discrimination or prejudice based on race. This sounds a lot like "dear white people..." </TEXT>
