We are going around in circles, but let me explain it one more time to you.  Calling a white woman a stereotypical Native American name is racist, regardless of your reasoning for doing it.  It is a testament to your ignorance that you can't seem to understand why that would be offensive.  </TEXT>

Yep, the restraint I exercise is this:  I only call something racist when it is, in fact, racist.  Look at my comment history and you'll see that I very rarely call someone a racist, only when they are using racist language.  I know it is difficult being outside of your safe space.  I know you are probably used to being able to say whatever racist comment you want to make without being called to task on it.  Perhaps you should go to t_d where all dissenting opinions are banned and racism is accepted.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Close Gitmo and do what with the people still there?

Bring them to the United States and put them on trial.

 All troops were removed for all intents and purposes. A small fraction still remain.

Yes, bring them home. 

 Tougher stances regarding those countries wouldn't have done anything at all. Like actually nothing. So you can't count that as a failure.

You can't know that for sure.  Russian expansion, in particular, is a foreign policy failure of the Obama Administration.  I am an Obama supporter, but I'm willing to admit his failure on this front. 

No new wars and no invasions of wrong countries.

These are successes.  I wish there would have been more foreign policy successes.  </TEXT>

Please show me where I said that her sentence did not contribute to her mental health decline.  I never said that.  In fact, I agree with you that her incarceration and the solitary nature of her confinement most likely did contribute to her mental health instability.  That being said, just because a person has mental health issues as a result of their incarceration does not make the fact that they are incarcerated "cruel and unusual".  That isn't my beliefs or ideas, that comes from the Supreme Court of the United States of America.  They decide what is cruel and unusual, not you or I.  </TEXT>

Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road." </TEXT>

Back in July 2014 just 10 percent of Republicans held a favorable view of Putin, according to a poll conducted by the Economist and YouGov. By September of 2016, that number rose to 24 percent. And it's even higher today: 37 percent of Republicans view Putin favorably, the poll found in December. While the Russian president still has a net un-favorability rating among Republicans, his standing has improved dramatically  from a net negative of 66 points to a mere 10 points.  By comparison, only 17 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of President Barack Obama, the December poll found. Obamas net negative among Republicans is 64 points  significantly worse than the partys take on Putin.
