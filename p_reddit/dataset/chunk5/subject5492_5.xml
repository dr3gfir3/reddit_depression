	<TEXT> One just got arrested for stealing a cop's gun and giving it (not selling, just giving it away) to a convict (who was on parole for gun violations).

10 or so have already had kids and have moved to random parts of the country.

One died of heroin OD.

One committed suicide.

Most actually just work at auto shops, as far as I know.

Source: I used to hang out with a lot of the bad kids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had the same problem back at school. The only time was able to go to the gym was at night and I always took preworkout. It had me so jammed up though that I could never fall asleep until like 2. I was so tired for the next day that it did affect my studies eventually.

Back at home, i go to the gym in the morning but don't take preworkout anymore. I have a cup of coffee about an hour before and it does the trick for me. Plus no I can sleep </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm currently running a 1200-1500 calorie diet (19 Male on a cut). It's been about 4 weeks and I've already lost 10lbs (178-168). Is this too much? I presume most of it is water weight. I'm just wondering if I'm also losing muscle mass as well cause of all the weight loss, but my lifts have been about the same though and I'm hitting my daily protein goal as well according to MFP.

Also, where is the best place to by a small food scale? I'm guessing any grocery store?

Edit: My diet basically consists of chicken, eggs, whole grain rice/bread and fruits/veggies. Pretty basic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it bad to change to a new program if you haven't finished the old one. I'm currently doing a bodybuilding.com workout plan, but I don't enjoy it much. The workouts aren't that great and it seems to have a heavier focus on cardio than lifting. I was thinking of switching to a p/p/l split with cardio in between but not sure if I should finish my current program first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am going to go ahead and be the one with the unpopular opinion and take the downvotes.

Honestly in my eyes he only got fired cause he was the women's coach. If he was the men's coach he would still be there and nothing would of happened.

 In one instance, according to the report, a player asked Handrahan to stop yelling at her during a meeting and the coach responded by saying, I havent yelled. Do you want me to show you what yelling is?

If that really is one of the reasons why he ~~got fired~~ then that's kind of bullshit. Coaches aren't there to be your best friend. They are there to get the best out of you and if that means hurting your feelings then so be it. My old lacrosse coach said things 100x worse to us then "get horny for the puck." We just sucked it up and moved on. He wasn't our friend, he was our coach. If he needed to be tough, he got tough. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Look Back At The Arizona Coyotes Last 10 First-Round Draft Picks </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-06 00:20:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So a user on /r/nfl is doing something like this right now where they take a look at the past 10 draft picks of each team. I thought this was a cool idea and wanted to try it myself. If it gets good feedback and y'all like it then I'll keep going. Enjoy!

Team Subreddit: /r/Coyotes 

**Overview**


Forwards | Defensemen | Goalies
--------|----------|-------
7 | 3 | 0

* *Players Still With Organization:* 7
 
* *Non First-Round Picks Whove Had Success:* Keith Yandle, Daniel Winnik, Kevin Porter
 
* *Biggest Hit:* Oliver Ekman-Larsson
 
* *Biggest Bust:* Peter Mueller
 
* *Best Chance At Success:* Max Domi

**Picks**

*All information for players taken from either HockeyDB, HockeysFuture, TheHockeyNews or Wikipedia(no shame)*

*NHL Stats current as of 3/3/15*

**2014: Brendan Perlini-LW (12th) NHL Stats: None**

Analysis: The Yotes newest draft choice, this young boy from England is a pretty big one at 62, 212lbs. A solid draft year saw Perlini score 71 points in 51 games. Known for his hands and puck skills, Perlini adds a nice scoring touch to the offensive game, as shown by 42 goals in 3 seasons of OHL play. Mix size and skill together and you have yourself a nice net-front presence for the future.

**2013: Max Domi-C (12th) NHL Stats: None**

Analysis: Son of Tie Domi, this kid most likely wont be known for dropping the gloves at any time. With slick mitts and a great shot, Domi is an offensive threat anytime he steps onto the ice. Whether it be passing or shooting, look for him to be in the action. His maturity and decision-making has been questioned, but once he hits the show and receives some veteran help, look for that to fade away.

**2012: Henrik Samuelsson-C (27th) NHL Stats: 2 GP, 0G, 0A, 0P**

Analysis: Another son of a former NHLer, Henrik is the son of two-time Cup winner Ulf Samuelsson. With only 2 NHL games under his belt, Samuelsson is still developing and hopes to make the big jump soon. Playing for Swedens MODO as a teen, he made the jump to the OHL in his draft year, putting up a respectable 23 points in 26 games. Currently with 25 points in 51 games for the Portland Pirates, Samuelsson is a big body, power forward with a nice set of hands.

**2011: Connor Murphy-D (20th) NHL Stats: 86 GP, 4G, 10A, 14P**

Analysis: Seriously? Another son of a former NHLer, Murphy is the son of Gord Murphy. A product of the U.S. national development team, Murphy ended up backing out of his commitment to play at the University of Miami and signed with the Sarnia Sting. I say it was a good move as he became one of their top defensemen in his two seasons there. Only spending half a year in the AHL, Murphy made the big jump for the end of the 13-14 season putting up 8 points in 30 games. This season he currently has 6 points in 50 games but hopes to remain a fixture on the Yotes defense for years to come.

**2010: Brandon Gormley-D (13th) NHL Stats: 26 GP, 2G, 1A, 3P**

Analysis: Son of a formerjust kidding. A highly touted prospect in the 2010 draft (6th higher N.A. prospect) Gormley is blessed with a wicked shot and is known for his power-play abilities. Dont knock his defense though as he can shut you down there as well. 4 years in the QMJHL and 3 in the AHL has given this kid all the time in the world to develop and he has excelled at both levels. His current situation has him on the Coyotes roster with 3 points in 21 games.

**2009: Oliver Ekman-Larsson-D (6th) NHL Stats: 321 GP, 49G, 93A, 142P**

Analysis: One of the most dynamic defensemen in the NHL right now, Ekman-Larsson has been a contributor ever since being drafted by the Coyotes. His first full NHL season was in 2011-12 and he put up 32 points in 82 games. A very mobile puck-mover, Ekman-Larsson knows how to find spots and create opportunities. Finishing 7th in Norris voting in 2014, the sky is the limit for this young stud. 

**2008: Mikkel Boedker-LW (8th) NHL Stats: 383 GP, 67G, 107A, 174P**

Analysis: Speed, speed, speed is Boedkers primary asset. A very fast winger with a nice set of hands, look for him to dish the puck around on the offensive side. Going back and forth between the AHL and NHL since being drafted, Boedker got his first full season in 2011-12, putting up 24 points in 82 games. A regular fixture in international play for Denmark, look for him to be a solid 2nd-liner for years to come.

**2007: Kyle Turris-C (3rd) NHL Stats: 376 GP, 84G, 121A, 205P**

Analysis: The Man, The Myth, The Legend. THE Kyle Turris. A great offensive center with a nice shot, Turris was the Coyotes highest draft pick the past 10 years. Coming from the U of Wisconsin in 08, Turris played a solid two seasons with the team before being traded to the Ottawa Senators in 2011.

**2006: Peter Mueller-C (8th) NHL Stats: 297 GP, 63G, 97A, 160P**

Analysis: Ew. That pretty much sums it up. All signs lead to this guy being a great NHLer and having a pretty good career. 2 seasons in the WHL saw him put up 136 points in 103 games. The transition though never happened. After an awesome rookie season, Mueller could never replicate the production and it just kept sinking and sinking. Finally, traded in 2010 Mueller now is out of the NHL and playing in the Swiss League.

**2005: Martin Hanzal-C (17th) NHL Stats: 493 GP, 88G, 158A, 246P**

Analysis: A gritty center, with a solid two-way game, Hanzal has been a consistent 30-point player in each of his 8 years with the organization. Getting the A in 2011, Hanzal has now provided a nice veteran presence that will be good to have in years to come. A respectable 24 points in 37 games had come to an end this season when he suffered a back injury that looks to have him sidelined till the end.

**2004: Blake Wheeler-RW (5th) NHL Stats: 516 GP, 138G, 209A, 347P**

Analysis: A big, burly winger at 65, Wheeler is a very gifted player who can get into the dirty areas. Coming out of the U of Minnesota as one of their top players, Wheeler never played a game for the Coyotes as he was traded to the Bruins in 2011.

 **Final Thoughts:** 

The Coyotes have drafted some solid pieces in these 10 years. With a focus on offense, even with defensemen, the Yotes have been doing well at keeping their picks in the system and helping them grow. Now with their focus on a rebuild, look for them to continue their successful drafting.
