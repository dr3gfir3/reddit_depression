	<TEXT> Sorry, the title says it, but perhaps it's not clear. It's the first time the scientists have been able to observe this--to make it happen--in a lab flask. The controlled conditions, coupled with the amazingly short timescale it occurred on, basically open up a whole new world in experimentation. Or at the very least, in observing the processes of evolution.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the problem, as I see it:

People use this peer review to "prove" that EmDrive is sound and that the "theory" behind it doesn't break physics as we know it. What option do actual science communicators have but to respond to this with a "no" ?  

Honestly, I haven't seen a bunch of "nay-saying people from an armchair." I have seen a bunch of sensationalist media hype (like this article), and then people offering more nuanced perspectives. It's not like there haven't been a proverbial ton of media stories supporting EmDrive. Check the ScienceAlert headline. Subtitle is "It works."

No. It likely does not work, according to scientists. Or at the very least, its viability is seriously in question. Saying "it works" does not make that clear at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "In passing a peer-review paper, the theory behind the drive has now been considered sound and reasonable." 

*No.* That is not what this means at all. What it actually means according to a real astrophysicist: "Its important to note that passing peer review means that experts have found the methodology of the experiments reasonable." That is a notable distinction. The methodology being sound is not the same as the hypothesis being sound. 

Much better articulation of significance: http://www.forbes.com/sites/briankoberlein/2016/11/19/nasas-physics-defying-em-drive-passes-peer-review/#aed8eb676e2c </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  ress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.

Let's quote the rest of that, just to be clear:

"Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage."

Not enough?

"Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a 'discreet and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities."

Yeah. They definitely aren't a minority. Never faced oppression. Oh, and they totally don't deserve equal rights...but they never faced oppression. But yeah, everyone else was doing it. So I am sure that makes him a great guy.

	<TEXT> I think the "in video games" thing makes it kind of clear that it's obviously not talking about literally killing humans. The whole phrase is "An AI Was Taught to Hunt and Kill Humans In Video Games," and that's exactly what the deep learning was used for--to make the AI beat humans in deathmatch scenarios...to help it target and defeat "enemies". That's the word-for-word phrasing used by the researchers. 

If it didn't have that "in video games" caveat, then I'd totally be with you here.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If an autonomous car is taught how to drive, and one of the objectives is to *not* kill humans, then the car was taught how to not kill humans. If an AI is taught to play a game, and one of the objectives is to kill things (humans being one of those things), then the AI was taught to kill humans. The whole point is not "ah, this is terrifying" (because it's really not), but to highlight the importance of developing sound policy as we continue to advance in AI research. It's a discussion of why this matter, not why we should be scared.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the problem boils down to the fact that people upvote **anything** that has to do with UBI, regardless of whether or not it is a quality post that relates to a significant piece of news. The same applies for anyone Elon Musk related...regardless of its significance, if it has Musk or UBI in the title..there is a high probability that it goes to the top.

I'd recommend being more diligent around these topics and determining whether a submission actually offers something that is new, significant, and unique.

They did modify human embryos **again** (as they have been the other other public group to have done this since they did it last year) and then did modify ****against HIV****.

Given the direction of the comments there, I don't blame you though. Just a weird thread. </TEXT>

Regarding popularity, to be honest it's just a super wavering thing. It hasn't been consistently higher than this over the coming months, and it hasn't really been lower.  </TEXT>
