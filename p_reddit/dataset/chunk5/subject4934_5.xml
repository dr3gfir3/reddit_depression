	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'd love to world quest, but I'm also a big fan of healing. Personally, I've struggled with world questing on a healing spec since I picked up the game and don't see that changing. Because of that, I can't decide on a dps class, as I've never really thought about them much and I'm painfully indecisive. 

So for example, I'm curious about the look of Shaman. But I'm also very weary of ranged classes because I feel if they get caught out or get in melee range, it's gonna be a pain to deal with. (the melee Shaman seems way too "buff this basic attack animation" for me).

I'd love some suggestions. I really want to quest the older expansions, but if the answer is Demon Hunter then I'd be willing to pick up Legion sooner than planned.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been looking into making an alt lately, but I really can't decide on another race. I've come to know the stats are a pointless thing to focus on, and it should just be the look that appeals to you most. 

With that.. I can't help but wanting to go human each time. My original character way back when was Human, right now it's a draenei, but looking for my next char.. I can't help but want human again. 

Nothing else really appeals to me, and the zones are all pretty weak when I compare them to Elwynn Forest. Of course other's may feel different but just love running around it. 

Buuuutt.. I also don't want to get 5-6 characters in and have all my characters be Human, as it feels incredibly basic, but damn I can't shake the feeling of them just looking great as everything. 

Thanks for any thoughts! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So after last season, I was lost. The fact that they were filming in Winter killed me because I knew it'd take longer. Then I luckily had a full rewatch of the series with a friend of mine who was new to it, so getting to indulge in her questions was just a wonderful way to keep the world fresh for me. 

Then I dropped all thoughts of it. I always try, to make sure it's not a long year. I don't come to this sub too often, but when it comes to a conversation about it, I can't pass it up.

Anyway, it's around that time of year when we get a trailer. We won't be getting one any time soon I'd imagine, but nonetheless, the feeling of awe is encroaching on my life now. I just watched a clip or two from season 1 and I had that "And this is why I love GoT" moment. It wasn't anything wonderful, but just the simple Ned-Rob conversation on the way to King's Landing. I had forgotten how much time I've given to the show, the books, the mods, the games, the talks.. How emotionally wrecked I was watching the Jon reveal, seeing Dany's ships actually going to Westeros. Of course it was a bit of a joke, "she's finally coming, hurdur".. But it's true. Dany will actually land in Westeros within the next 6-7 months of our lives, and I can't hold back how I feel about it. 

This post may be pointless to a lot of people, but I feel a good vent could get you in the mood too, or just get you excited for what's to come.

I'd love to hear your thoughts down below. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I get it, a lot of you hate Felicity. I've hated her too, but quite frankly, I'm sick of this sub giving her shit. She was right this episode. Yes, she was right most of last season because of bullshit writing, but last night, she was legitimately in the right, and the camera/writing really made it noticeable. From the second she meets Black Siren she is calling the bluff. Then we get a shot of her working on a punching bag. So quite frankly, I'm not even that mad about the punch.

As for the new BCs intro.. Yeah it was weak, but it's also a character intro. How many characters have been introduced through a 3 second clip that is cliche as hell? Give her a real chance.

It's okay for a character outside Oliver to be right. And I get that a sentence like that seems like an Olicitard, but believe me when I say I'm not. I left last season because of it. 

This season has been fucking great though. We've had 9 solid episodes, so to see people say they're out and done already, after one episode of a character on the main team having a "power moment" if we wanna call it that... I just don't understand it. 

I'll agree it's been a weak episode in comparison to this season, but for fuck sake, it's really not worth jumping ship over. Calm down. Sometimes this sub is as toxic, if not more toxic than Olicity shippers. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been playing about a week, and I'm probably 20 games in. (I clocked in a few hours over the years but never went beyond a game or two every few months)

But I've found myself playing on Agility champions. I've played Nukers, Pushers, Carry, but all only on the Agility focused heroes. 

So is this a normal thing to do? I understand you have your tanks, carry, supports, junglers etc. Is what I'm doing okay? 

Even though I come from another MOBA, I have absolutely no idea what's going on most of the time when it comes to builds and jungle routes/clear style (I go by the latest 7.0 builds, but I have no idea why I'm building what I build)

So I'd love some advice. Should I branch out and try a game or two in Strength, Intelligence, or should I learn the Agility builds/items before adding in a new hill to climb?

Thanks for any help. Loving the game so far, and hoping to delve further in. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'll be picking up a PS4 soon, and I'm in a position to pick up one full price game. My three options are: Overwatch, Battlefield 1, and Titanfall2.

I'm trying to decide on one, but no matter how many trailers I watch, or reviews, I really can't narrow it down.

I know one of the upcoming answers may be "whatever looks the most appealing to you" or something like it, but as much as I hate to admit it, I am incredibly indecisive, so I'm looking for thoughts on the gameplay, playerbase, learning curve, and how long it'll last before going dull. (I say that last one because of the first Titanfall game)

So to those of you that play them, can you give me some thoughts please? Thanks!

PS: This won't be my only game, I have another few already, but this will be the game I pick up with the console. 

EDIT: Post says 3 comments, but only has 1.. I wonder what they're saying from the void. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been job hunting since I finished school 7 months ago, and I'm really, really struggling.  I found one that nearly worked, but distance was way too big a factor and it fell short. 

Ever since then, I've been going for retail, and places like McDs, Starbucks, the big chain grocery stores etc. I can't find a damn fucking thing, and it's been killing, even to the point of it's now an issue with my SO, as she hit it on the button with her first application, and is now very much comfortable. 

So, with that said, I've always taken a minute or two to look at jobs like Assistant accountant, personal assistant, cabin crew for ___ airline. 

I've always skipped on them, because of a slight line or two in the "must haves" section, that makes me wonder how much of an idiot or fool I'd be to try get that place, or if I fit it both in personality, and looks quite frankly. Some may say looks mean nothing for a job, but I feel they very much do when it comes to certain matters. 

So I'd really appreciate any help you guys have to try nudge me over this wall I'm at. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So basically, I've just realized after 20 years in the country (give or take), I've seen fuck all of it. And with that, I plan on going west. That being said.. I don't drive. So I'm looking to a bus or train ride, and quite frankly, that seems way more appealing to me, because if it's like I imagine, it'll be beautiful at times. 

What I'm looking to know would be in regards to stuff like the bus' themselves. The room, the comfort, on board services etc. The same going for the train. 

Then how is getting from bus to bus, or train to train, because I imagine it won't really be a one stop thing. Although, being honest, I came here before putting in real research, to make sure this is something that won't destroy me after giving real time and resources to it. 

I'd just love some guidance, as someone who will be travelling the country for the first time, and really has no idea what to do, or where to start, but I know I have to before I regret it later in life. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before I read Geoff Johns' ominbus for Hal's run (only up until Sinestro War) I really didn't care for Hal, or the GLs in general, but afterwards, I was in love. It's easily my favorite run of all time.

With that said, I remember during the Rebirth livestream that Hal's run would be gutted alive because of the writer, but I don't remember the comments on Green Lanterns.

That being the context.. I am really, really enjoying both of the runs. When Rebirth started, I gave everyone a shot. I picked up some new reads, I've learned to like some new characters..But the quality of both these runs is shocking me. Now, in all honesty, I'm only on 11# of both runs, so there is time for it to go wrong, but Hal's will bomb, and this Phantom Ring stuff.. I may be in the minority, because I don't have any opinions on what I read yet, but this is just wonderful IMO.

I'd love to hear thoughts, and if they're negative, I'd love to hear what you find wrong with each series. If not, I'd quite frankly still love to hear how you guys feel, as I've missed out on a lot of Weekly Discussions.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Here's the list] (http://www.readingorders.com/Collections/GreenLantern)

I'd like to pick back up where I left off, but I'm really not sure how the reading order goes. How good is this one? I remember in the omnibus, volume 1, it didn't do entire issues at once, it rather jumped between issues and mixed it up for the best story.

How well does this do the job? And is there anything you feel is missing, or something unnecessary, please tell me so I can get the most out of the story. Thanks!

Also how important are the side issues after New 52? Like GLC, Red Lanterns, New Guardians etc. Hal's journey with Geoff ends in Volume 3 of GL I believe, but New Guardians ends at volume 40? Do I continue that to get the most out of the Guardian story, or do I even to read that? I'd really love some advice as I'm genuinely lost, and really overwhelmed by all of this. Thanks!

EDIT: Looking more into it, where do the 3 issue tie-ins fit during Blackest Night? Tales of the Corps, Batman, Superman etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the amount of songs caught me off guard, and for most of them I try to sing it, but I simply can't find a tune for it, or find myself at a poorly timed end of sentence. Also, when reading in song, I tend to continue the rhythm of the song for a few sentences into normal text. 

Then at times I try continue reading it like it's normal text, but it seems wrong to do, not because I feel people choose to sing, but because it simply feels wrong to do, if that makes sense.

So after passing the tale of Beren and Luthien I realized I need a plan for this to enjoy it as best I can. Any ideas are welcome, thanks! </TEXT>

The thing is, it keeps bugging out and freezing along random parts of the screen, making it all eventually go grey. I'd expect it to be a hardware issue, but I've often watched 1080p files on my pc. 

I tried googling it but it just gave some advice to edit the preferences but I did that and got nothing. I'd love some advice. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically, my SO has been vague about a new coworker of hers lately, which is odd considering she tells me basically everything about the rest of them. 

Then earlier today, I realized she was getting ready more than usual and said something like "I wonder who is working in ___ section today?". Just seemed kind of odd considering she doesn't really have a reason to go near said section, and along with her preparing herself more than normal.. I'm kind of wondering if my thoughts are way outta whack or if she's actually trying to impress another guy.

So, I'd love to hear any stories you guys have. I understand I may be thinking irrationally right now, but I'll still post, because I'm curious as to how others would feel about it, and it usually helps me realize that I'm being an idiot. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is the best way to organize a trip? [Switzerland] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-25 15:55:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've traveled before, but I've never been the head of the organizing. I was either the child, or the student, but I've never organized it myself.

I am now saving, and looking into a trip to Switzerland for 2. Yet I have absolutely no idea where to start. Do I search the web for a flights and hotel package? Just flights, and separate accommodation? Are there any types of sites I should ignore? Should I be going straight to the airlines website for prices instead of a hosting site? Or should I look into this through an actual booking agents, the old way?

Also, if any of you know anything about Switzerland, I'd love some advice on where to be looking. All I was told about it was that she wanted to snowboard too, which is a dream of mine, so that's a must have.

Thanks for any help! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm not from the Philippines, but I do have Filipino friends however, although they don't really talk about him often because they don't keep up with his 'antics' for lack of a term. Being on Reddit however, I see his name fairly often as of late, so..

For those in the country, and outside, how do you feel about him? Would you have voted for him, did you? 

Is his current situation with the US something you admire, removing them etc, or something you hate, and see him to be shaming the country by making such bold statements about the western power?

How do you feel about his drug stance, and current death count under his presidency? Do you feel he's doing right by those in the country, or that he should be taking the 'treat them first' approach? 

And before being afraid to comment, I'd genuinely appreciate how you feel on these matters, so those of you browsing past, please do not downvote others because they feel differently than you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm talking about trust issues, emotional problems etc. 

I ask because I have an incredible problem with trust. I've been with my SO a while now, and we've been great, truly. We had a hiccup or two, but nothing to cause a real fight.

With that, I've noticed a few major times I am flawed. She got back talking to her ex a few weeks back, and I was real worried about it. Quite frankly childish. I've since gotten past it, and now I talk to him on occasion too if we're in the same vicinity. With that... I still get a drop in my stomach whenever they talk. I know in my heart she wouldn't go back, because she really has come across as someone wholly given to me. 

She also works in a bar, doing frequent night shifts, and although I know it's simply part of the job, I can't stand it when she tells me some of the guys flirt with her on the job. She says she doesn't flirt back, and I believe her.. Yet a voice somewhere in my head is telling me she may find someone who hits on her, and pulls it off, then instead of taking the 3am bus home, she just chills with him for a while. 

So yeah... I have problems, I genuinely see that. I've been trying to get past them, but I have no idea how. I can't talk to her about it. Nothing is more unattractive to a woman than a man thinking she'll leave him when she's simply doing her job, or talking to a friend. 

I'd truly appreciate any help on the matter. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll have a few days work for a company this week, and it being my first job, I'm not sure what I do with the dole situation. I'll be collecting on Monday, working on Tuesday. Do I tell them I'll have a week's work when I'm collecting, even though it may just be a week? I asked the guy if it was cash in hand or whatever, and he talked about it not being cash in hand, and he'll need my ppsn. So this seem's like it'll be a full time gig after this week, but he also told me he only knows of a few days this week, and it may be nothing afterwards. That'd mean telling them is pointless, right? Or  would it mean I'd get in some kinda trouble, for being paid for more than 20 hours while on welfare?

I'd love some help here, as I legit have no idea what to do here. Thanks!

	<DATE> 2016-09-05 14:05:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I grew up on the LOTR movies, and when I heard the Hobbit was being released, I loved it too. At the time of release, as bad as they were, I loved them. Maybe not the third one, but I enjoyed the first two, and quite frankly still enjoy the first one.

With that said, I'd never read any of the books, so I subbed to Audible and am currently 'reading' The Hobbit right now. This is amazing. I just wrapped up the first chapter,and as close to the opening of the movie it is... It's just a whole other level of awe for me. The dwarves are definitely tougher. Even Bilbo, as much as I loved Freeman's early Bilbo, I really appreciate how 'to the point' this one is. 

I'm done my walk for the day with my dog, but it has me wanting to just solo walk around the neighborhood so I can listen to it without being distracted. 

Just thought I'd share my thoughts for anyone who was like me, having seen the movies but never tried the source.

So questions. What makes the Took's so odd? The rumor of fairies seemed odd, but at the same time, there has to be a reason they're an odd bunch of hobbits.

Also, apart from Smaug, are there any dragons in the world, or when was the last? We know that the last one in the shire was thousands of years ago, but what about elsewhere?

	<TEXT> So I feel trust issues are easily one of the biggest problems in a relationship, and showing them is one of those things you should never really do. 

With that, I can't help it. I'll be real. My dad left when I was a kid, came back into my life, and left again because he didn't find me worth his time. I've been cheated on twice and left for another guy once. I don't have the greatest track record when it comes to holding faith in people. 

Now, with my SO of 2 months, I'm finding myself getting irked by the dumbest of shit. Jokes she makes with friends that could have a flirt vibe to them, whenever her friends ask her to go out for a night of drinks I feel a hole in my stomach because I wonder if she'll get wasted and find herself on another guy, because after drinking with her once, I realized she turns into that fun loose chic that dances with everyone (and that was only a few drinks during the evening).

I.. I just don't know how to deal with this. I can't talk to her about it, because being real, she has given me no reason at all to feel like this, so if I ever said it, I can only imagine how she'd react, but with my past.. It's just a struggle, and I really can't come up with something to deal with this.

I know Kate from her time in Batman Eternal, right?

That's also how I know Spoiler. Although I never finished the series, I knew of her.

I know Clayface from Snyder's run.

I have no idea who Orphan is though. Was she in Eternal too, and I just missed it? Was she in the Snyder run, and I don't remember her? 

I'd love some help on this, because as of late, with these team runs going around, and all these new names and faces I'm learning from picking up more runs, I'd love some help. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've always aimed high growing up, but now that I'm 20 and really, really want to move out on my own, I've been looking for a job. Considering I haven't gone to college yet, my list of options are small. I've been trying local deli's and shops but being in a small village, work is limited. I've branched out now, and applied for McDs. I get the stigma around it, and at one point I was above it, but I'm not above money. 

I've been looking at Dunnes and Tesco now but can't find any close enough to me.

So what do you feel is a great first job? I'd love to hear your thoughts. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Have you dropped any titles from Rebirth yet? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-27 13:40:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I understand of course we haven't seen all the titles, but we've seen most. [This is the current list] (https://i.gyazo.com/fee97e2f087c16532d6bdc0ba90f9420.png).

Honestly, it's painfully expensive, but the only one I see myself dropping any time soon is Batgirl and the Birds of Prey. I don't know what it is, but I simply haven't clicked with this. I see the humor in some of the lines, but I feel it's not really aimed towards me. (+Something seems off about the artwork, and I can't put my finger on it.)

Besides that, even both GL runs have me curious to how they approach what they're dealing with. With the normal GL run, it seems a whole lot of the writing is caught up in how Baz/Cruz deal with eachother and how they're always conflicting. If they are forever conflicting, it'll mean no character progression. If they stop conflicting.. It'll be interesting to see if they go good cop/bad cop as on the universe. 

I feel I'm writing to much into my thoughts on each run, but it's been a while since I've posted here, so I have missed a lot of discussions, so forgive that. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts though, on both what you've dropped, why you've dropped it, or why you're holding on to a run.

That being said... I don't see myself ever trying for it, unless it's what she really wants. I find myself being way too possessive for the idea of sharing her with another girl. I may be crazy for this, but I just don't see myself being the type of guy willing to share, never mind the joke of actually satisfying two chics.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So hear me out here. I've been reading for about a year, but there was maybe a 3 month break around Christmas, so I haven't actually read that much. 

With that, when starting, almost all of my reading was Snyder's Batman, and then suggested books, like Geoff's GL omnibus, Superman Unchained, and then the general great stories. So reading all of those, I knew going in that I was getting a great read.

Now though, I'm reading the Rebirth releases before hearing the thoughts of others, and because of it, I'll be honest. I haven't been let down by anything yet, and feel it's all pretty solid writing.  Of course there were stand outs, which in my mind, were TEC, Superman: Rebirth, and GA. The rest were solid, but I expected it from King and Rucka, so there's that.

But I'm afraid I won't be able to spot bad writing, considering I don't think I've actually read any poorly reviewed work yet, and  when it shows up, I'm not sure if I'll spot it.

I understand this comes off kind of serious, but it was just a thought I found interesting, that I'd like to hear your guys' opinions on. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been playing on/off for about 2 years now, but never given it my all. Considering I'll be getting a competent pc soon, and Warcraft has me at a high for the series, I'd love to get back in. 

With that, I've tried logging on to my 100 hunter, and my 60 monk. Both of which are so lost for me. While I'm choosing a class, I have no idea where to look, because I've heard about the classic expansion updates coming to all classes, or most classes. 

What are some notes we should take into consideration when choosing a class a few weeks before Legion? 

For example, I love healing, I really do, but it seems a lot of healers that are strong, are required to do DPS to heal. I want someone that strictly focuses on putting out healing. The Pally heals by dps, right? The Monk heals a lot on his own, but I've heard real Monk players are meant to jungle dps stance and healing stance. So is there an update coming to healers that puts what I want into a character? 

Thanks!

EDIT: Also, I don't mind going Horde this time around, as Durotan is probably my favorite character in Warcraft lore now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So a lot of movies are set in New York, but they're just a place the characters walk around. 

However, I feel there are movies that make that setting part of the story and it's a much bigger part than it normally is. For example, there's a Joseph Gordon Levitt movie based on him being a delivery guy, and the city plays a huge part in that. It may not be a great movie, but I hope that explains what I'm looking for.

	<TEXT> A  lot happened this episode, it really did. From Dany to Arya to Bran to Benjen to King's Landing.. But watching that Sam dinner scene again.. It's fucking incredible. 

I was distracted by the scene before it last night, wondering who it was under the hood, but watching it now.. They cast his father perfectly. He has the face of the man told in those stories. He has the tone of someone who truly wouldn't want a son like Sam. It was fucking incredible to watch that scene take place, to the point of me feeling awkward, even from an outside view, you could feel the tension when the camera moved to Sam, looking down at his plate.. 

I just thought I'd make this post, as I feel these scene is really well handled, but it slipped through the cracks because of the insane level of setup they had. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-05-28 00:10:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, going into GL, I didn't care for the character, as the only thing I knew about him was his smart ass comments in the JL run, and his movie.. So expectations were low to say the least. 

Now, I'm sitting here, reading the descriptions for each character, big or small. I can't describe how #25 made me feel. It was pure perfection. Having them fight the end out, without power? While also giving Cyborg Superman a fitting send off, which by the way, completely caught me off guard, and I felt fucking awful for it, which was made worse by his skull yet again floating around. 

But.. The whole reason I gave the run a chance, was because I read a comment once, about how emotional the scene was when the citizens started lighting up the city. I bawled. I cried for minutes with no progress due to the constant stream of tears. It is definitely my favorite moment from reading DC so far. 

I could go into it more, but it feels messy and rant-ish. Sadly though, I need to wait 2 weeks now before picking up v2 due to pay. I also understand you guys want me to try GLC, but it's just not on the cards right now, with how expensive the other 2 omnibus' will be, Rebirth, and my fresh copy of Kingdom Come waiting for me. 

Geoff. Thank you. You brought me into comics with JL V1, and now you've given me another incredible ride. Can't wait to continue it with V2 in the near future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll admit, the first issue took a bit of getting used to, and I didn't really enjoy it, but I also know King is writing it, and having read Vision, and plan on reading Batman, I thought I'd learn his style. 

Grayson 2 got easier, and I'm adjusting to the non-superhero-esque run. 

3 though.. God damn. Well for starts, the "Dick!" page was way outta left field. After that though.. Those final 2-3 pages were upsetting. I found the villain cliche and super 70s with the "blind villain who is connected to revolvers that he looks through", but in the end.. Damnit. It was upsetting, and I'm I can't see why.

Then to make it worse, they killed the agent he was getting on with. Damnit King. If this level of writing is coming Batman... Oh let it be June already.

EDIT: And now, after being chased by some teenagers, he has been re-imaged as a french gymnast who happens to be gay, to stop the girls from following him. This is gold. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So we can all agree, when Jay showed up, we all had mixed thoughts. Some saw the potential for having a Flash duo running around, while in reality, he was a very, very dull character, with little to do and was very stiff acting wise. 

That has completely changed now though, in my opinion. He was stiff because he was actually playing a role. It's like seeing an actor play a bad actor in a movie. He hated being Jay, so because of it, he did as little as he could, while slugging through the shit. 

Now as he walks around, in what I can honestly say is probably the best looking costume on the show so far, he is really coming into his own. Everything from just talking to Barry in his lab, to that haunting look on his face before killing Papa Allen. 

Just thought I'd give my thoughts, and I'd appreciate if you shared what you think about him in general. Thanks! </TEXT>

I don't really know the point of this post, but I had to share my excitement, as I've been fairly away from this sub for a while, trying to subdue my expenses on comics, as I spent about 140 euro within a week on reads.

In doing so, I've gone from B3 to B1 with 80 lp in 2-3 days. I've taken the QT attitude towards the game and damn it feels good so far, and seems to be working. 

Watching his streams do seem to help a lot too, because he's into explaining his builds for the champ he's playing. For example, he's against Essence Reaver on Lucian, because he feels the crit can be found somewhere else for cheaper, along with the damage, and make it a better deal in the long run. 

So what kind of general tips would you give for players like me, just looking to get outta here? Whether it be positioning, champ select notes, or quite frankly, I'm not sure what else could be said, but that is also why I feel I should be making this thread.

There is also a whole lot of stuff I don't know about though. As someone who doesn't have much time in the game, I don't know what items I should be keeping, although I've marked Adhesive down for looting. That's about as far as I've gotten though. I didn't know my water pump set it to my junk collection until I read it on here. I also just found out empty water bottles can be filled up too. Along with the looting, what perks would be a must have? For example, I have idiot savant, and lone wanderer, but because I'm going for a base-centric playthrough, I now need to level up Int twice so I can unlock Science, so my next 3 levels are for one perk. I'd like a place where we can warn people about this, because it seems a lot, lot more important now, considering we can go from exploring the roads peacefully, to being hungry, thirsty, and in a gun fight, in an instant.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking for a game to keep my attention, without being an online game, as I feel I've had enough of that for now. 

I have been trying the Nioh demo, and it's opened my eyes to this genre. I tried demo souls back when I was a full on cod fan, only really playing cod with the occasional sport game. So I of course had noooo interest in a game that punished me as bad as it did. I tried Bloodborne too, and enjoyed it, but if broke after a few weeks.

So what is Ds3 like? When playing the older one, I knew the task was make it out alive, but I've never felt there is a story to the games even though I know lore is pretty huge among the following. 

I don't really know what to ask, because I'd imagine the combat is close to the same as the older versions, but more refined in terms of mechanics and bugs. How is the world? How are the classes? I've heard Knight is the easy run character to go. What are the others like? 

Is this game worth 70 dollars, in your opinion, when compared to other 70 dollar games.

Any thoughts in general would be very much appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I thought it would be done after killing the first demon at the top of the hill. It wasn't. Then I thought for sure it'd be over after the ship boss. It wasn't. Now I'm exploring this new area... And holy shit. I was never a fan of the Souls series, but this will be a pre-order. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the games setting, but just like the souls series, I can't stand the bosses. How do I go about beating this one? I am level 27, and my sword does about 170, while the bigass hammer does about 210. With that, it feels like I never do damage, and then get caught by the spin or fall and that's that. Dead. 

Any advice is great, thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard it as the lovechild of Souls, Ominusha, and Tenchu. 

I have no love for the Souls series, as I got introduced to them way too early into my transition into challenging myself during games. Maybe I'll go back one day, but as of right now, this Nioh demo is quite frankly brilliant. It has the same kind of combat as Souls, and is on par with the level of punishment. It doesn't hold your hand either, although it does drop tutorial notes along the way. 

It's a Ninja/Samurai version of the Souls series. If that doesn't sell it, I don't know what will.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw a post here a few days ago about how great the gaming experience he got from it was, although I didn't give it too much attention because I had just bought MLB the show... 

Even with that, I really haven't seen anything about this game outside this sub. Is it simply because it's the classic game on our console, or is it genuinely a good game, with solid mechanics and whatnot? 

I understand it sounds harsh in the way I ask it, but after dropping 50 on a game that has been replaced by a demo.. Well I'm wary of where my cash goes. I know for sure that come the following week, I'll be pre-ordering Uncharted 4, but for now, I'm wondering about this game, because damn did childhood me love it. 

Now we just need Jax to come back and all will be okay.

Thanks for any thoughts. </TEXT>
