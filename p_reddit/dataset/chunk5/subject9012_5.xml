	<TEXT> wtf are you talking about? seriously. The sets were quite diverse and while there wasn't so much color they were all so unique. The plot had holes on purpose. The soundtrack was one song the whole time played at different speeds. You sir are wrong on 3 levels. One more and you're in wrong limbo for ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally think when they have beat out other actors for a part is better. When you do a roll that was written for you, you don't really need to "flex" your acting muscles because that part obviously comes easier to you. I like to see the skill in acting. I thought Jonah Hill was a one bit actor until Moneyball and Wolf of Wall Street. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's pointless. It's not Nintendo licensed just like the emulators you can get for handheld devices. Even the guy who  owns a retro gaming shop in my area said emulating on your phone or tablet is better if you really must have SNES on the go, and he said they are not selling for shit. 

It looks too big to play comfortably for more then 15 -20 min. Where would you use it the most? Maybe a road trip.? I dunno. The screen is small as hell and some games wouldn't even be enjoyable or playable without really squinting. My honest opinion is that it is a stupid product that isn't needed at all but some people will "have to have it." </TEXT>

A pre 300 Gerald Butler pulls his weight as well. This movie made me realize fantasy/post apocalyptic movies could be just as believable as non-fiction. </TEXT>

My older sister got Aladdin for SNES one christmas because she was in love with everything Aladdin back then. Right away we noticed the games mechanics were 10/10 and the levels got better and better and more fun as you progressed. The Genie's levels were my favorite so I made a up a dumb little jingle to remeber "Genie, Jafar, Aladdin, Abu". 20 years later and I still randomly sing Genie Jafar Aladdin Abu.
