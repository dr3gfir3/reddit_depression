	<TEXT> And personality, etc, would be great if the scripts added it after establishing the woman is pretty. 

But a lot of them don't. "Pretty" is the beginning and the end of the female character's characterization. And that's the problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same premise, but it wasn't the stated inspiration. From Wikipedia:

 On May 12, 2010 it was announced that Columbia Pictures and Happy Madison Productions were in talks to develop a 3D animated feature film based on Patrick Jean's video-game themed short film Pixels. On November 10, 2010 Adam Sandler hired Tim Herlihy to write the film for his studio. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know how when you're reading a book with a lot of dialogue, and occasionally you have to go back and look for a character name, because you can't tell who's saying which lines?

That's what it's like reading a script with a lot of CONTINUOUS. Okay, I get it, the setting is continuous but continuous from what? Continuous from the previous continuous? I go back one page, then another page, and then realize: Oh, okay, it's all continuous from this one utterance of the word "NIGHT" in a scene heading three pages earlier. 

So I'd stick with NIGHT, or THAT MOMENT (sparingly).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Script reader here. I see that a lot, and honestly, I'm not so much a fan of it. It's a bit of a shortcut that paints a picture in broad strokes, rather than getting detailed. I just think there are more striking ways to write it, that aren't as simplistic as "A = B". 

There's also the possibility of clash. If you describe a character as "Tom Hanks", but the character does things that (in my mental image of him) Tom Hanks would never do, then you've accidentally created an inconsistent character.

That being said, one of my all-time favorite character descriptions is an apocryphal one from *Panic Room*, where David Koepp describes Forest Whitaker's character as "*Humphrey Bogart in one of his less pleasant roles*". I don't know if that ever made it into the script, but it's always stuck in my mind: succinct, vivid, clean.  </TEXT>

- Catching your lover's eyes from across a smoky bar?

- Saving the world through the power of music?

- Stalking a dangerous criminal through a blizzard?

	<TEXT> James Dean was an exceptional actor; one of the early adopters of Method acting, as opposed to the classical Humphrey Bogart/James Cagney model. He earned two Oscar nominations, but only starred in three movies.

"Rebel Without a Cause" is his most famous film, because it was one of the first major movies to address an audience that Hollywood had never thought to target: teenagers. Movies were made for adults and children, but with "Rebel Without a Cause", teenagers were finally given a screen idol of their own. 

Dean's popularity grew as a result -- and then his career was cut short by his death. And as is the case with a star who burns out quickly, Dean's iconic status was solidified. So Dean's legend is partly due to his acting, and partly due to the fact that he died at the beginning of a very promising career. Tragedy breeds icons. </TEXT>
