	<TEXT> My boyfriend and I are sharing the same accounting class at school.  We decided to do a homework assignment on a certain day.  I had other homework I had to do first so I tell him to just go ahead and get started because I'm quicker and could catch up. Apparently that's the same as insulting his intelligence and calling him a dumbass and so he storms out of the room.  We both know I've taken accounting before and he hasn't so it's easier for me than him.

Some people could find the insult in a bouquet of flowers.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I thought Mysterious Skin was such a moving film about child abuse.  What are your thoughts on the film looking back at it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was young my uncle asked me how liked my new aunt (he recently got married). I said "She reminds me of Aunt Marta except she's way bigger."

No filter kid-me called my uncles new wife fat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure what to do now..  I want to play Skyrim Remastered with mods, but I'm thinking it'd be better to just wait for the Scorpio.  This is odd because before this week, buying an Xbox wasn't even in my realm of thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely disappointing for me.  Been patiently waiting for mod support for Fallout 4, and was excited to hear about the current-gen edition of Skyrim coming out.  After the PSPro disappointment, I'm now instead seriously considering getting an Xbox or waiting for the Scorpio, which wasn't even in my realm of thought a week ago.  </TEXT>
