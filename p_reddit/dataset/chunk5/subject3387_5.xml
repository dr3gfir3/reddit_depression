	<TEXT> Basically I've recently founded a startup and am in a business incubation centre. Next week I have the opportunity to have a (strictly) 15 minute mentoring session about my business, the market, etc with an angel investor, a management consultant, and a marketing research consultant. That's 15 minutes with each of them, 1 on 1. I'm wondering from your guys experience, what would you ask were you in my shoes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all, first time poster so sorry if this is the wrong place. I'm working on an Asian facing project and trying to get my hands on some figures. Basically, I'm trying to discover the number of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese companies exporting out of their respective countries. Google didn't turn up much for me, nor did their respective national statistics offices or the OECD website. Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What would the second part translate as? I'm having a hard time getting it right in my head. 

"I seem to have a sly thought as to where the authors have have not sold...". Something like this? Or am I totally wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And yes, desu comes after adjectives and nouns. But it also comes after the simple form of verbs. for example (taberu desu). 

Masu is just a form of verb conjugation. . (Tabemasu). I've dropped the "ru" in taberu and added "masu". This is "I eat", the present tense conjugation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically  is . I.e. the verb  followed by the particle . Using  is a lot more casual. 

To answer your question, as another comment says, asking  is fine.  Or even . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also heard good things about Fukui and the JET community though I never went there.

 Ishikawa also seemed to have a very good community and is a good city.  Pretty big, good for nights out, restaurants, lively, young. 

For me, Kyushu is too far away from Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto,  and Kobe. Of course you have Fukuoka city in Kyushu but that's about it. There are a lot of great sight seeing spots in Kyushu and the local food is great, but like I said, a bit remote for me. Although my Kyushu JET friends loved it there. 

I was based in Yamaguchi and couldn't recommend it more.  It has a good active JET community and you're never too far from Fukuoka or Hiroshima.

If I had to choose however, I would choose Hyogo prefecture, with the hopes of getting Kobe. Huge JET community. It has beaches on one side and mountains on the other which is good for the outdoorsy types.  It also boasts a large international
 community. And you're never too far from Kyoto or Osaka if you want some tradition or party respectively.  </TEXT>

Maybe they share with others? Shared houses in Cork are generally about 80 a week. Of course this is really 80 x 4/5 a week total depending on the number of tenants. </TEXT>

His theory is interesting. I lived in western Japan for a long time and never heard this.  You have set me a goal for research though,  thanks!   </TEXT>
