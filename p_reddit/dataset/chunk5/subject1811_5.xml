A Note from the Author: 
*These are the journal entries of Bruno Frei. They were found hidden away at the top of a lighthouse that is located on a barren cliff in Canada. As it was written in 1842, the short passages have been slightly modified so that they are easier to read in modern English. Finally, the events that took place that winter are not proven and should not be taken as fact; these could very well be hallucinations or writings to pass the time.*

__December 27, 1842__

The days go by and the hope of leaving seems to fade. The cold has started to permeate through the walls. I ask my Otto what we should do about our situation, even though I know that the question is meaningless. The repetition I face everyday makes me want to fall from sanity. We are stuck.

We are stuck.

___
__December 28, 1842__

I suppose I should write out our backgrounds. Yesterday I was not in the right state of mind. I am Bruno Frei, of German descent and Otto Jans also is of German descent. We both were immigrated to Canada and we were living well for a while. And then we found ourselves without work and thus here we are, as lighthouse keepers.
Fifteen days heretofore a massive ice storm struck the lighthouse and froze the water. Otto and I are cut off from the rest of the world until winter ends and the ice thaws. We have so many days until spring.

__December 29, 1842__
	
I am writing todays entry in the lamplight after todays event had already taken place. I am going to be frank; Ottos mind is starting to deteriorate.

This morning I woke up to find Otto already awoken. He was staring out of the single window on the ground floor. Even from across the room I could hear his heavy breathing. But I ignored the signs of a man who had gone mad and traveled across the room to eat a breakfast of stale bread.

As I slowly ate the bread I heard him grunt and say, Dont touch my bloody journal.

I bit the side of my mouth in confusion and replied, I never touched your stuff.

I woke up an hour ago and it wasnt beside my bed. So I searched everywhere in this lighthouse to no avail. And do you want to know where you put it? Out in the snow. I repeat, do not touch anything of mine. And do not (at this point, Otto was nearly shouting) put anything out in the snow! I figured saying anything would just make the situation worse, so I said nothing.

Today I assumed the duties of maintaining the main light of the lighthouse. Every other day Otto and I would switch. Today he had to do nothing, which was a terrible thing. Boredom can be horrific.

The view from the top of the tower was awe striking at one point, but now the constant swell of snow prevents me from seeing farther than a couple strides from the tower. 

Around an hour past sunset I climbed up the short ladder to a small nook in ceiling. In it I kept various pictures that I drew to keep myself from becoming insane. But today they werent there. Jumping to a conclusion, I thought that this was revenge for what I had supposedly done to Otto. So I stormed down the narrow spiral staircase and found Otto sleeping on the ground.
	
I furiously roused him awake and after having a tense conversation with him, I decided he didnt do anything to my papers. I can tell when he lies.
	
So today, I managed to steal Ottos journal and have my drawings get stolen.
	
I cannot wait to leave. Spring must come sooner.

What is going on?
	
Ghosts?
	
There are voices.
	
Otto?
	
They say, 1827.
	
1827.

What is Otto doing?

Ghosts?

___
__December 31, 1842__
	
He says that he heard them to, but I think he is just trying to frighten me. The way he holds himself is of confidence.
	
I am writing this entry at breakfast today, I dont want to deal with writing down how Otto frightens me today. It just makes me more fearful. Across from the small table Otto is trying to make small talk, but I cant talk to someone who is doing this to me.
	
I am putting this journal away.
	
What is Otto doing?
	
____
__January 1, 1843__

Otto does not like me anymore. Every time I say something to him he just stares at me and mumbles something back. Is he hiding something?

But I have my suspicions.
	
For the past two days and today various things around the lighthouse are being moved around. There was a ball of rope that normally rested on a shelf on the way up to the top of the tower. On the 30th, that rope was untangled around the ground floor. Otto feigned innocence, but I know it was he. It had to be.
	
On the 31st, a butcher knife we had was stabbed into the wood lining the window. When I pulled it out, I noticed that the knife pierced out of the lighthouse to the outside world. I had to seal it up, by shoving some fabric into the thin slice. Otto feigned innocence to that.
	
And on the 1st of the New Year, which was today, I awoke with no blankets covering me at all. It was in the dead of night. There were no lights on. The lighthouse creaked in the wind. Footsteps seemed to sound from the floorboards. There was a small lamp that I kept beside me at night. I used to not keep a lamp there and then the voices started. I lit the lamp.
	
Shadows danced due to the flickering of the lamp. Otto flipped over in his bed. My blankets were gone and there was no chance that I would go searching for them in the dark of night.
	
When I awoke, Otto feigned innocence. He acted confused, he acted worried. He would make a good actor for a play. I searched through all of the rooms and did not find them.
	
They were outside. A warm fire melted the snow off of them. 
	
Now, I am going to write this next part down in the hope that Otto does not read this journal. 
	
I think Otto is trying to get me to go mad. 
	
But what did I do to merit that?
	
Does he think that this is a game?
	
___
__January 2, 1843__
	
I found something. I was up in the top of the tower today, working the light. In my boredom I was running my hand across the bricks on the wall, when my fingers ran into something along the wall.
	
After a quick inspection of the brick I found out that it could swing open.
	
A secret compartment.
	
I opened the small compartment and in it a journal sat. I carefully pulled the slim book out of the compartment and gently inspected the outside.
	
It was maroon which golden words printed on the front. A Book for Thoughts. It was a journal. But who's?
	
I opened it up and written in elaborate lettering was the name Isaac Walker. I carefully fingered the frail paper and flipped to the next page. On the top was the date January 4. Then there was a rumbling of the metal staircase to the top of the tower. I hurriedly shoved the journal into the wall and properly hid it. Otto reached the top of the stairs just as I faked looking out the window at the constant blizzard.
	
He growled softly, Whatve you been doing up here.
	
Nothing, Otto, said I. He didnt believe me, but he let it drop. I am not going to go through the entire length of the conversation, but to sum it up he attempted to reconcile to me about the past few days. He never apologized for moving things around the lighthouse, but he apologized for the lack of talking.
	
I dont know if this is petty, but I never apologized back.
	
I will apologize when he stops moving things around in the night.

__January 3, 1843__

For the first time, nothing moved around last night. And today Otto and myself seemed to be at peace with one another. Nothing much happened at all. All day I was on edge that something was going to happen. There is such a tense feeling around the lighthouse today.
	
____
__January 4, 1843__
	
After dealing with the maintenance of the light I am ready to read the journal. I dont want to lose anything about the mysterious journal, so I will be copying everything down into this journal. And as the days line up, I will be reading a passage a day and writing it down into this journal.
	
January 4, 1827

I am writing in this journal not in the hope that it will help me, but in the hope that I can record what is happening to me. Maybe this will help someone in the future. I am trying to stay calm, but it is getting harder as the days go on.
Just as a quick insight into my situation, I am a lighthouse keeper trapped inside my lighthouse alone. Things are moving around uncontrollably. I hear voices and they seem to say 1816. If I am going insane then so be it. But I fear I am not.
Tonight I am going to risk my supplies and my life. I will keep the lamps on all night. Something just fell down at the bottom of the tower.*
	
The writing stops at that and I forgot to mention that most of the bread was relocated to the top of the tower as I slept. Otto he is still feigning innocence. But I am starting to wonder
	
___
__January 5, 1843__

Something happened, but I have not a clue why. Did Otto and myself anger the spirits? When I woke up, Otto and his bed were gone. There was an empty space where he previously was. I ran up the spiral staircase and there the bed was. It was hung using the rope off of the framework of the lighthouse. And Otto was tied to the bed.
	
I panicked, but after a few minutes of hyperventilating I managed to calm myself down.
	
At first I thought he was dead, but after using the ladder I untied him to find that he merely lost his consciousness. After we had both recovered the bed, we parted. He to the top of the tower and I to the bottom.
	
For any future readers, I would like to say that although it sounds like that didnt frighten me, you are completely mistaken. 
	
I carried the journal down to the ground floor and hid it behind my bed the day before, so here goes:
	
January 5, 1827

The voices are driving me insane. 1816 1816 1816. Just moments ago all the lights had gone out; including the main light for the lighthouse. None of the lamps down here worked, so I had to go to the top of the tower in the dark. Every step I took my fear grew.
Must my brain be so faulted? When I reached the summit I saw a dark shape move, closer, closer, closer. But when I turned the light on, there was nothing. I swear by the light of the moon that I was not imagining anything.
I fear I may not be able to muster the courage to go up to the top for a while. My emotions seem to be more important than my duty.

I would like to write out that I am now pretty worried. What happened to him, could happen to me.

__January 6, 1843__
	  
The voices have been driving me insane. All through the day and into the night. 1827. 1827. 1827. But a moment ago all the lights had gone out; including the main light for the lighthouse. None of the lamps down here worked, so I had to go to the top of the tower in the dark. Every step I took my fear grew. When I thought back to the journal my eyes got tear filled.
	
Otto looks fine. I cannot concentrate. I am worried. I must continue writing this out. This could save someone yet to come.
	
I have decided to quote the previous journal entry, as my experience is the same as he: Must my brain be so faulted? When I reached the summit I saw a dark shape move, closer, closer, closer. But when I turned the light on, there was nothing. I swear by the light of the moon that I was not imagining anything.
	
I fear I may not be able to muster the courage to go up to the top for a while. My emotions seem to be more important than my duty. Otto may be the only Lighthouse Keeper.
	
January 6, 1827

God save me.
God save us all.
I am trapped.
I cannot leave.
And I have found another journal from 1827.
I cannot write my findings down. It is too much. I would rather hide the thoughts away, then write them out.
I know my fate and I cannot change it.
I am with tears. I almost feel like I cannot continue.
Maybe I should light the lighthouse on fire? Then no one will have to suffer the same fate as I will.
Hope must be kept.

____________

**January 7, 1843**

The journal from 1827 offers no clue to what his fate will be. I need to know, because I fear that I will have the same fate. I have read through the rest of the journal, only three more days, and it never mentions anything else frightening. Almost as if the writer lost his sanity. I am afraid I will not copy them down, because as mentioned before the writer mustve lost his mind.

Just as an insight into my situation I am currently too scared to leave the ground floor. I fear that I have turned into a lady living in a mans body but I cannot help it. Otto spends his entire day at the peak and never mentions the day with the bed.

My hair has started greying. From stress I assume.

But the worst part of all of this is my left hand, which I seem to have lost control to. If I attempt to curl my hand into a fist, my fingers only slightly move.

What could this be from?

Cold has spread in from the frigid outside. My breath turns to steam as it exits mouth. How much longer will this suffering last?

Will the ice ever melt?

__________________

**January 8, 1843**

*Unfortunately, due to the lack of Jan. 8 we can only assume what must have happened. We can connect that this day was a horrible day for Bruno and that he likely lost much of his mind (as the state of the next entries shows that he was basically insane). Sadly, Bruno assaulted Otto on this day; which is referenced on Jan. 13.*

______

**January 9, 1843**

Stop! Please? The madness.

_______

**January 10, 1843**

What is happening to me? What am I doing? I cant remember anything. Something bad happened. What happened? Help. Otto? Hes gone. To where? I do not know. Whats wrong with this damned lighthouse? I do not know.

___________

**January 11, 1843**

He is back. Otto is back. Was he ever gone?

He doesnt speak to me. Have I done something?

I am starting to feel like my journals are my thoughts put into papers. They are so random, so crazed. Please God, please God

Can you help?

______

**January 13, 1843**

I know what happened, but I fear that my knowledge will die with me in a short amount of time. I have accepted my fate. I cannot escape it.

I am going to go tell you the story of Thursday the 12th and of today, Friday the 13th, which happens to be the date of my impending death.

Otto was recovering from a knife wound. Did he stab himself? Every time I went to aid him, he would hold up a knife in defense against me. As if I was the one who cut him. I have looked back in my entries and this mustve happened on the 8th, as there seems to be no pages. I cannot bring myself to believe that I did it.

Suddenly, Otto tensed up and I did as he fearing the worst. And dear God, I shouldve been more scared than I was. And then I heard the noises. They were coming from the tower.

Step.

Step.

Step.

They were getting closer and coming from the spiral staircase.

Otto and myself looked to each other. I looked at him for assistance and he looked at me with anger. We couldnt go anywhere. So I did the only thing that I could possibly do. I ran outside.

The evening sun shone from the horizon in all its glory. I could still hear the footsteps on the metal steps. I grasped my ears and collapsed down onto the ground. The sound still penetrated. And then there was a massive wave of sound, sounding like what I can only assume a gun does.

I stood up shakily and made my way to behind the lighthouse. I was upset at everything.

I was frigid in the outside and since the noises had stopped I went back inside. As soon as I got in the door shook behind me and shut, locking itself. I panicked and tried to escape; I couldnt. I sprinted up to the peak of the lighthouse and here I am now.

Hours passed. Nothing happened.

I locked the door into the top.

God, help there, I hear the steps. They are the steps of the phantom.

Each step I hear. With each step my death comes closer.

The phantom has entered the body and mind of Otto. He is hunting me. I fear the phantom had gone into me on the 8th and I stabbed Otto.

When Otto gets up here he will kill me and then he will bring the bloody blade to his chest and stab himself. It has happened before and will happen again.

God damned life! Hes at the door.

The door is (unreadable scribbles)

And here ends the Lighthouse Keepers Journal. </TEXT>
