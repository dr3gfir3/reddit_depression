	<TEXT>  How do those switches feel versus brown/clear switches? Does the quiet tactile feel similar to browns, and the quiet click feel similar to blues?

*Broadly* speaking, the Quiet Click (aka Tactile) is tactile like Browns, and the Click is clicky like Blues. But they feel quite different. The Quiet Clicks are snappy as fuck! I've used Browns and felt they were more like dirty Reds - they go down a bit, then get a little scratchy (the "tactile" bit), and then go down again. By contrast, the Quiet Clicks feel like the tactility is right at the top, and it's very noticeable.

One thing I should caution you about: I've had my keyboard for less than a year and have had two switches break, and had to solder new ones in.

 Also, do they not have a lot of keyboards out there? I couldn't find anything that was close to what I was looking for with matias quiet switches.

Yeah, it's a bit of a rare thing. Mostly your options are Matias themselves (I don't like their keyboards), KBParadise, or custom builds.

Pretty sure the KBP V104 is close to your needs. </TEXT>

"The Rebel" is more like a second name that the character has, just as I have about 3 different names depending on whether you call me "Henr" (as most do), "Hendrik Christoffel Botha" (as e.g. the government does), or "Botha" (as e.g. a classmate might). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The dominant reason is low production volumes. We are generally spoilt with electronics; most electronics we use are manufactured in massive quantities, leveraging economies of scale to drive the price down as low as it can possibly go. With our niche hobby, production volumes are much lower, especially when it comes to stuff like cool keycap sets and so on. So to a large extent you are paying a relatively high amount for the manufacturer's setup costs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, people hate it. I can't make up my mind about it.

On the one hand, it's pure capitalism: you can't help it if the person who sold it to you set a lower price than they could. You are perfectly within your rights to snag it up and then sell it for higher.

On the other hand, I'm getting more and more anti-capitalist with every passing day. This way of living is not doing the world any favours. It particularly harms small niche communities like ours, where the free market breaks down a little. </TEXT>

You can run into conflicts, but this is no different to any other time you collaborate on a repo (i.e. if someone merges something into master that affects your work). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "not only will we not provide that service, we will actively work to kill it and then try to convince people that they never wanted it."

If killing the other service gets you 20% of its players back onto _your_ service, that's worth it. After all, by law, the IP belongs to you. Those laws exist to _reward_ the creation of IP. There is nothing "dickish" about shutting down people who provide a _substitute_ to your product using your own, unlicensed IP.

 it's completely spitting in the face of players like me, who simply want to enjoy a product that we paid for, but is no longer officially supported.

The _second_ you signed up you knew this was going to happen. Or did you somehow believe v1.0 would exist until the day you die? </TEXT>

The manual system also banned people. The manual system had no reason to favour one champ over another.

Therefore the changeover to the automatic system **would not change the relative play rate of champs**. If your argument - that Vayne players are toxic - is correct, then the Vayne play rate should have stayed **the same**.

The fact that it changed points at a *different* cause. </TEXT>

Yes, because people playing on Vanilla servers are not playing on official servers. There's a direct conflict there. Vanilla servers substitute the actual good/service Blizzard is trying to sell.

Fan art, on the other hand, serves to get people more hyped about   invested in the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand the hesitation, though I think you're wrong. It's not dependency, not really - if a few years later your keyboard breaks, you just shrug and go back to the shitty standard design. 

You seem to have realised that using the numpad is more comfortable for gaming. Very few people realise this, but it's a good insight! The idea with a split is essentially to make *all* your keyboard use more comfortable in precisely the same way. 

But if you're still not convinced, I'm sure others will make some good recommendations.  </TEXT>

I think you need a split keyboard for sure. Look at things like the Diverge and Ergodox. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One way in which competitive team games get new players is by recommendations from friends. I am more likely to try a new game if I know I can play it with my brother. However, most competitive games place limits on the allowable Elo difference between teammates. 

Smurfing solves this by giving experienced players a way to get new people into the game. Growing the player base is almost always good. 

Therefore, there exist at least some situations where smurfing is good for the community.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Could believe that this game has a memory leak issue. With amount of bugs/issues this game has launched with, it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in their QA to catch something like a memory leak.

Not just that, memory leaks are pretty hard to catch in the first place unless you set up test cases specifically for that.

Anecdotally (again), crashes seem to happen during busy moments (lots of fire, abilities, enemies) rather than quiet ones (I don't think we've had a single crash during a quiet moment).

 Have a hard time believing that it could persist through the game crashing to the "desktop". It would be pretty crazy if the PS4's OS allowed memory to remain allocated to a game that is no longer running.

Eh, maybe some kind of zombie process or something? I don't know enough about the PS4. We're just going on experience here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my wife has this suspicion that the game tends to crash when the PS4 is running low on memory. We don't have the PS4 Pro - just the vanilla one. Our experience in the last few days has been that if we restart the PS4 after, say, 3 games, it tends to crash much less.

If you are affected by these crashes, try restarting after every couple games - see if that helps. </TEXT>
