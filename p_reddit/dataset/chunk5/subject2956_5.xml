	<TEXT> Let me try:

Muslims in India should know that we chose to be secular, but our cows chose to stay holy.

Now let me try a non-stupid sentence:

Muslims in India should know that they chose to stay in India after Partition, when they were given a choice not be secular and go to Pakistan, so they have a duty to stay secular, more than any other community. If they don't want to, they can still leave.

	<TEXT> Siva said he didn't know whether Sasikala's behaviour had anything to do with the four "morphed" photos that had appeared before the May Assembly elections, showing the two MPs together. He denied any kind of relationship with Sasikala.

When the pictures appeared in April, Siva had been quick to say they were doctored. Sasikala had remained silent for over a week before releasing the same photos that now showed her with husband Lingeswaran.

The implication was that her husband's head had been replaced with Siva's using Photoshop. She had blamed it on an expelled AIADMK member.

	<TEXT> The most popular President in India's history was a Muslim. I don't see why people won't vote for a capable, secular Muslim for PM. I would.

Muslims can also help by not voting for candidates who they think are good only for their community, but are good for the whole country. There are some genuine concerns that Muslims only look out for their own kind, and not others. A change in their voting patterns would go a long way in dispelling those fears. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very well written, both about the DU admission process and the problems with the TN educational system. Only brahmins and a few other castes(including my caste) are classified as upper castes in TN. Less than 10% would be in the general category. Even within my caste, some sub-castes are classified as backward, making it easy to cheat the system. We have a lot of people from our village who were smart enough to claim that they are from that sub-caste years ago, and managed to get reservations. My ancestors migrated to Chennai generations ago, so they never could do this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Product of dynastic politics, yes he is, but...

He has had a strong academic record - all-India second rank holder Chartered Accountant and second rank holder in Law in Mumbai University. A well-known investment banker, he has advised top corporates on management strategy and growth - [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Goyal)

And now he seems to be doing a very good job as a minister. It doesn't matter whose son he is as long as he can perform and excel at the job given to him. It might be informative to compare his academic, professional and now his political achievements to other dynastic politicians from Mumbai.

	<TEXT> Almost nobody eats beef in TN and very few people even cared about the controversy. Personally I am against the beef ban (though I don't eat beef) because what I eat or drink is my business and I would prefer the least laws regulating that.

As for an alcohol ban there would be much more opposition here if it comes through. While I can't speak for everybody here, I don't take an attempt to curb my personal liberties lightly, even though my alcohol supply is not going to be affected if there is a ban. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note that she wants to ban alcohol in a "phased" manner. I suspect that the first phase which might involve closing the bars a bit earlier itself would last for 5 years.

This so called anti-alcohol movement in TN has been going on for the past 2-3 years now, primarily driven by some attention seeking activists. J has been against prohibition because it's the revenue from booze that has been financing her populist schemes. She is making these noises only to make sure that some of the female votes does not go to the DMK, which also has been saying it supports prohibition. Neither the DMK or J is going to enforce prohibition if they come to power, because then they would have to shut down all the populist schemes which would make them very unpopular.

Personally I am not worried by this because I get all my booze from Pondy nowadays. But even my friends who mostly buy from the TASMAC shops here are not bothered, since they think it's unlikely they would be closed down. </TEXT>

Driver of the Ford Explorer plows through 7 cars without letting off the gas on 295N, Baltimore-Washington Parkway, ramming roughly 3-4 cars off the road and nearly flipping one vehicle. The driver claims "her brakes failed" and appears to hit the gas pedal by accident. No one was seriously hurt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not surprising that there aren't too many Indian citizens in this leak or the Swiss one. Money is stashed abroad primarily by Indian businessmen who export/import a lot, usually in the accounts of close relatives who are not Indian citizens. Richer families even settle their dumber children abroad just for this purpose. Some even hold money for other people for a fee (usually politicians, celebrities or other businessmen). Even if their names crop up in these leaks, they will just claim they have nothing to do with it.  We might see a lot more Indian names if there is a leak out of Dubai, Singapore or Hong Kong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No-one told me I was going to be interviewed by a Muslim.

I don't see what is anti-muslim about that. Mishal Husain who is a Pakistani born presenter was trying to make Suu Kyi say things which agreed more with her pro-Muslim view of the issue when she clearly didn't want to in [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1BRn360e2M). If anybody was being biased here, it was Husain. But then it is blasphemous to call any journo biased. </TEXT>

Footage shot by a driver with his mobile phone shows that the landslide took place at around 09:10 a.m. on an expressway in Anhua. It continued for about a minute, blocking traffic and causing several vehicles to line up on the highway.
