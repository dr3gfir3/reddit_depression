	<TITLE> Having some Mild Barotrauma after a week of diving! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-06 02:05:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Back from a week of diving in Roatan (amazing BTW) and I'm experiencing what I've self-diagnosed as a case of MEBT (middle-ear barotrauma) after looking around online. I got back late Sunday but the first time I really noticed the symptoms, ringing in the ear, a feeling like I'm underwater, some slight discomfort, began on Monday morning. Since then it's persisted mainly localized to my right ear. From what I've read online, and from what DAN emailed me back after inquiring advice from a medic, it seems like the only thing to do it wait ... and see and hope it isn't a perforated eardrum of an inner ear barotrauma or something worse. I'm taking sudafed but I'm a little worried about how long it's going to take since I don't have insurance and don't want to go to a DR if the problem is just going to clear up... Anyone with any experience, let me know how it goes for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exacto. This comment should be at the top. Don't talk to the cops. But this kid, look at his picture, the cops must have had an easy time convincing him he was going to be turned into a piece of currency in prison and laughed at how quickly he rolled over on everyone he sold it too!

Part of the problem here is selling LSD ... at least as far as I'm concerned it's something usually shared among friends, not something one looks towards as a money making venture. He should have stuck to selling pot -- the charges would have been a lot less severe. Hopefully his parents get him a good lawyer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What this means is the Government isn't valuing these employees properly, hence their desire to go to the private sector. This is actually good news in some way, as they're likely to be replaced by people less qualified, with more to gripe about (being underpaid, etc.). Of course, it also means there are private concerns looking at monetizing the prosecution of digital crimes, something that some of Reddit's userbase (to say nothing of r/darknetmarkets subscribers) would find of the highest interest.

Then again, let's remember how RU was caught and how TSR was actually taken down, not by some insanely gifted investigators, but rather by incredibly shitty OPSEC.  </TEXT>

In case you don't know, he's written such gems as Angels and Demons, I am Legend, The Da Vinci Code, Batman   Robin.
