	<TEXT> Welcome to /r/Boston and Boston! I was a transplant from outside Philly about a decade ago. Some thoughts...

- Almost everyone living near the city uses the "T" (our subway). In other cities, people resist public transportation, but in Boston, it's the best way to get around. The T stops running just before 1am, so be prepared to take a cab if you're out late. Developers have build some great apps for the T, check them out here: http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/apps/Default.asp

- Good idea looking for a place outside the city. Some towns to consider are: Somerville, Medford, Brookline, Malden, ~~Jamaica Plain~~. In general, north and west of the city has more transportation options (driving up to Boston from south of the city is a nightmare). The closer you are to T stops, the more expensive the rent. So, if you have your own car, keep that in mind.

- Fun thing to do: Walk the freedom trail. It's a great way to see downtown, get familiar with local culture, and you can just walk it yourself and avoid crowds. Here's a map: http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/maps/pdfs/boston-nps-map.pdf

- If you enjoy good beer or bourbon (shout to /r/bourbon), Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville have so many great places. Go explore and avoid the chain restaurants.

Best of luck!

Edit: JP is a neighborhood of Boston. Maps and stuff. </TEXT>

McManus is writing his dissertation on how Ciceronian Latin rhetoric was the pedagogical lodestar of humanistic learning from the Middle Ages onward, how it was exported to the disparate cultures of the European colonies, and how it changed in those new contexts. His research in colonial-era archives throughout the world involves looking for anything written in Latin, basically, he said.
