	<TITLE> Is there a way to save a prior system version before updating to a new version? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-17 16:15:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Recently I so hated an update to my kindle fire hdx 8.9 that I called and complained, and Amazon reverted my kindle to the prior version.  Amazon also told me I wouldn't receive updates again unless I asked for them.  In short I hadn't liked the updated version because of a change it had made to the carrousel.

Anyway, now I'm reading about the Family Plan, and how it requires an update.  So what I'd like to do is update to the new version with the possibility of reverting again if the problem I'd had with the carrousel hasn't been corrected.

I'd appreciate any information about how to save a prior version!  Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The video was posted on reddit (where I saw it).  It was a high school/college band.  Looked like they were performing inside a church; the video cut off the very beginning (from what I remember).  Video may have been on a cell phone.  Sound quality wasn't the best.  But the performance was terrific.

Thank you for any info you can provide! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted to make a suggestion for the next Kindle, then realized maybe other people would have ideas too.  Never know if Amazon actually checks the sub, right?

Anyhow, I have an 8.9 Fire HDX.  I love it (after thinking before my wife got it for me that I wouldn't).  But I very much would like if Amazon would make the next version's memory upgradeable.  Yeah, yeah, the cloud.  But some sort of pop-in add-on would be nice.  I mean geez I have thumb drives that hold more than my Kindle. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A light netbook-type laptop for my wife? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-11 13:38:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My wife loved an old Asus netbook because it was small, light, and had a keyboard.  She dropped it recently, though, and it no longer works.  I'm trying to find a replacement for her and would appreciate any advice!  She uses it pretty much solely for word-processing.  Weight and footprint are big deals for her because she carries a lot of stuff.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: US

* Budget range: Up to $1500 (cheaper the better of course)

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): netbook/ultraportable for word-processing

* Screen size preference: doesn't matter

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): windows

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): n/a

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): n/a

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): none

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business 
compatibility): n/a

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): probably she'd prefer win 7

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: weight

* Build quality -vs- Low price: balanced

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: low heat

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: no

* A great keyboard: functional keyboard necessary otherwise n/a

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: functional ones

* Great audio: n/a

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.): USB slot for her thumb drive </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Please help me identify a movie </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-06 07:40:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have posted this question in r/tipofmytongue, but they haven't been able to help.  I am looking to identify a movie I saw some time back--I'm not sure exactly when, but it was made in approximately the last 20 years.

It is a zombie movie, not a monster movie.  In it, a female heroine dies at the end, possibly after the credits, on a road, possibly near an RV/after getting out of an RV.  It is not Diary of the Dead or Cabin in the Woods.  

The movie's production values are too high for it to have been anything by Argento or Fulci.  I'm reasonably sure it wasn't anything by Romero, as I'm fully familiar with those movies.  

I don't think it was a remake of one of Romero's movies, either, as I remember how the characters fared at the end in those (Night of the Living Dead--girl finds hunters; Dawn of the Dead, they make it to an island where zombies attack them).

I don't think it was any of the Return of the Living Dead Movies, as only the first one really was good (and I definitely remember its ending).

I am at a loss.  The girl with others escapes from somewhere, only to die (possibly after the credits).

Anyhow, thank you for any help you can provide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The movie was relatively recent--last 20 years.  All I remember is that it seemed as though the female heroine survived, probably with others, and as they were traveling along the road, they stopped for something and she was bitten.  Maybe after the credits, but I don't think so.

Not the remake of Dawn of the Dead, for sure, where they wound up on the island.  In this they were on the road.  I think they may have been traveling in an RV.

	<DATE> 2014-08-27 23:15:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few days ago, [as can be seen here](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2dr4ej/help_adding_second_router), you guys helped me decide to set up a wireless access point; I was trying to figure out how to strengthen the signal of my home wi-fi network on the second floor of our house.

Following your advice, I bought a Linksys WAP54G.  I configured it as an access point, and it definitely strengthened the signal.  Thank you!

But now I have a question.  Previously (using a FIOS wireless router provided by Verizon), whenever I opened my Kindle it automatically connected to my home network.  After I added the access point, when I open the Kindle it shows as connected, but I have to turn off wi-fi and then turn it back on before I can access the net.

I did not change any settings on the original router or on the Kindle, so it seems that there's some setting in the WAP54G I need to change so I can avoid having to take the extra step every time I want to use the Kindle at home.

I just don't know what setting it might be or if this "feature" is simply an unavoidable part of the WAP54G.

Could someone possibly tell me what setting this might be?

Thank you for any info/insight you can provide. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help adding second router </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-17 00:03:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a FIOS system which connects to a router in my basement.  Our pcs connect to it via ethernet and our portable devices connect to it via wi-fi.

I would like to strengthen our wi-fi signal for the use of portable devices throughout the rest of the house.  I understand I could add a repeater.  However, I also understand that I could add a second router, and that this would avoid any signal strength issues which a repeater might cause.

Accordingly, I would like to connect a second router through ethernet on our second floor and use both routers' wi-fi signals for our portable devices.

If I did this, what would be the 2 addresses for the routers?  Would I need to name the 2 devices the same thing and use the same passwords for each?  (Don't worry; they're complex passwords.)

Without addressing the issue of whether a repeater or a second router would be better (as I'm not asking about that), what other issues would I need to address in adding a second router?

I've found [this site](http://www.labnol.org/software/add-router-to-wireless-network/19716) which purportedly explains how to do it.  Do its instructions seem accurate/complete?

Thank you very much for your help!

	<TEXT> As I mentioned elsewhere, recently my Kindle's screen broke, and while I was looking for solutions (resolved now), I came across listings for Amazon's [kindle insurance](http://www.amazon.com/2-Year-Protection-Accident-Coverage-Kindle/dp/B00DQGIIM2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1401461283 sr=8-2 keywords=kindle+insurance+8.9).  I figured it would be worthwhile to see if anyone who's purchased/used it had any useful observations about it.

Thanks for any useful feedback!

Edit: okay actually it's an extended warranty program. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When life has seemed horrible sometimes it's seemed that hope was all I had--a dream that things might improve.  But hope might be a liar, as there is no promise that life gets better, and good almost always is accompanied by bad.

Maybe the best we ever have is good enough.

Not exactly hopeful huh. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question for those who love math </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-28 23:35:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, I apologize if this is the wrong sub for my question.  I was thinking maybe /r/CasualMath would be the sub but I couldn't tell which would be better.

Anyway, here's my question.  My 7 year old, a second grader, is very good at math.  He's so good that he's been doing math on the side for 2 years now (he doesn't get much support from school), and I expect he'll be done with 5th grade math by the end of the school year in May.

One problem I have is that he's been doing this work after school, and, though I'm not afraid of math and am okay at it, I'm not much of a teacher.  So I'm not sure if I'm simply introducing him to the concepts, since we're getting no reinforcement at school, or if he's actually learning the ideas.  He seems to be learning them, but....

Anyway, my question: are there things I can do to encourage his interest that won't burn him out?

I figure the redditors who frequent this sub must love math and so you'd be the perfect persons to ask.  

Thank you for any info/suggestions you can provide.

Edit: I'd like to thank everyone who's responded.  You guys have been awesome! You've given me lots of resources to consider.  Thank you!

	<TITLE> Book recommendation </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-02 15:35:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've recently read a book which ostensibly is about the NY Jets.  But it's actually about life as an employee of an NFL football team--and it's one of the most educational football books I've ever read.  It's so educational, in fact, that it made me think I'd be a bad mod if I didn't tell you guys about it.  

So here it is: [Collision Low Crossers](http://www.amazon.com/Collision-Low-Crossers-Turbulent-Football/dp/0316196797/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 sr=8-1 qid=1391351311), by Nicholas Dawidoff.

Dawidoff was given insider access to the Jets for the 2011 season, and what he wrote undoubtedly will educate *everyone* about the game.  It might make someone a Jets fan, which, lord help him/her, would be almost as bad as being a Cowboys fan (though they did make the AFC championship game 2 years in a row after the 2009/2010 seasons).  But that's a risk worth taking, because it would teach anyone a ton about the daily operations of a team.  

Read this book in the offseason, so next season we can at least *sound* like we know what we're talking about.  Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about Mark Davis </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-31 15:51:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys!  I'm a mod of r/Cowboys, and I have a question about Mark Davis.  For obvious reasons (as we're in the same boat that Raiders fans were in for years under Al, though maybe our boat actually is leakier), Cowboys fans tend to attach their hopes to Stephen Jones, Jerry's son.

But what's been your impression of Mark?  Better owner than his dad?  I mean, Al was great for a long time, but I guess he just got old, maybe.  Addled.  Anyhow, this question has been on my mind lately.  The Raiders have a great and storied franchise, and in my opinion one of the coolest logos in all of sports.  

So I'd appreciate your opinions about the changes under Mark, his skill set, and judgment.  Thanks in advance!

Edit: thanks guys for the feedback!  It was thoughtful and informational.  I appreciate it.

Only consolation I can provide: at least the Raiders have a GM.  (Big sigh.) </TEXT>

Sorry about the italics.  Something about including the 2 blanks seems to be causing them.

	<TEXT> How do you keep from getting lost in the game?  Somewhere right after I finished Sen's Fortress I just started losing the ability to figure out where to go next.  And remembering all the possibilities just became complicated.  Do you take notes?

I'm a parent and I have a job/family, so I can't play nonstop.  But so any time away and I start to forget where to go.  

And keeping track of the story is next to impossible.  The big guy with the floppy ears, the guy down in the dark....It seems like I don't have enough info to figure out who to help and who not to help.  And people I miss!  The lady in the cage below Firelink Shrine, the guy up the stairs to the right at Firelink Shrine who disappears at some point.  It just seems like I'm missing the timing on a lot of stuff I should be doing.

I am *not* ragging on this game.  I love it!  Its combat is the best I've seen in some 30 years as a gamer.  But seriously how do you keep track of where to go/what to do?

Edit: thank you everyone for your great ideas and encouragement!  I'm particularly relieved that I'm not the only one experiencing this. </TEXT>

But then when I try to run it, I get what appears to be a loading/downloading screen (with a little bar), and then the activity stops with the message "Download failed because the resources could not be found".  

This happens whether or not wi-fi is on.

I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing the cache and data, and nothing works.

I've googled and haven't been able to figure out what's causing this.  Is this simply the message kindle provides when a game's not compatible with a device?  Or is something else going on?

I'd appreciate any info you guys could provide!  TIA! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The bad thing about being a Cowboys fan these days... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-16 16:05:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ...is that there's no solution.  Jones won't fire himself, and if he fires Garrett there's no way that any competent established coach would take the job and last for more than a couple of seasons.  While coaching turnover generally is high in the league, turnover doesn't equate with success.  Instead, good coaches tend to stick around because they succeed.  But those coaches generally don't undergo the kind of interference that Jones creates.

The only coach who would succeed under Jones is one who doesn't care about the credit and who Jones would respect enough to leave alone to make football decisions (i.e., Garrett).  As we've seen with the drafts and, recently, the inexplicable extension of Scandrick's contract for no reason (which is a continuation of more of the same), Jones's decisions constantly hurt the team.

No good coach with an established record of success is going to put up with that.

The result is that if Jones fires Garrett, anyone he hires also will be unproven and/or most likely won't stick around.  Teams with coaching carousels don't win championships.

So there's no way out--except to hope that Garrett learns from his mistakes.  To be clear, based on what I'm reading, his mistake in the Packers debacle was his failure to clarify to Romo that the Cowboys needed to run the ball no matter what he saw when he came to the line.

I won't address Romo's own ignorance at calling pass plays when the primary need was to force the Packers to expend their timeouts.  That, at best, demonstrated Romo's distrust of his OL's ability to block well enough to succeed at running plays.

But all of the people calling for Garrett's head offer no realistic solution to the fundamental problem the team faces--and which won't be solved as long as Jones continues as GM.  And Jones owns the team and obviously loves his daily involvement in it, so he feels no pressure whatsoever to stop serving as GM.

This is why it's so difficult to be a Cowboys fan these days.  Rooting for the Cowboys unfortunately means rooting for Jones.  

We're stuck. </TEXT>
