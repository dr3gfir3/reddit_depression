	<TEXT> US education varies a lot from state to state, and from teacher to teacher. In my experience, WWI and WWII were on the curriculum. But because we went through things roughly chronologically, we never actually got to them due to bad time management by teachers.

Had a whole year of "Modern European History," but we never made it much past the industrial revolution. Had a day each for WWI and WWII at the end of the year.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd imagine that blood spurts out pretty fast and looks straight in person (probably why Caravaggio painted it that way). I guess the point is that knowing the physics behind projectile motion changes the way you imagine it coming out frozen mid-spurt. Not been to many beheadings myself, so I can only speculate.  </TEXT>
