	<TEXT> [A list of the archetypes](http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html)

I was reading through and realized that Caroline was probably The Caregiver. I think her drive to help other people is her main motivator. 

Was wondering if you guys had any thoughts about the Salvatores or any of the other characters (Bonnie, Elena, etc) ... Or if you think I'm wrong about Caroline, maybe she's something else. 

edit: Klaus is easy! The Ruler! But I could be wrong about that too... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! First time poster here, so let me know if there's a better sub for this question. 

I'm writing a fight scene.
And it's reading a little bit (a lot of bit) like a tennis match. 

*She does this. 
He does that.
So then she does this.
He does that*

Everything is starting with the two people in the scene. I've tried to fix it: 

*Angrily, he does this.
Not appreciating the punch to the face, she does that.*

But, I'm just masking the problem, not fixing it.

Before I do something out of this world, I pull away then raise my eyebrow,

So, will you, Beth Grimes? I grin.

Her eyes are sparkling. She blushes as she giggles and she says, it will be my pleasure. She pushes me down at the bed.

Then we go back to kissing.



I burst out laughing because the "at the bed" part. Not on a bed. At it. 

And then they go back to kissing.  </TEXT>

The following are the sentences as they're currently written. I'm wondering if I need a comma to separate the clause at the end? The first one, i dont think I do since "as he turns to walk away" is not independent. 

"Out," Curt sharply replies as he turns to walk away.

This next one, I have no clue so I just stuck a comma in there. 

"Blah blah blah," she says, all while still trying to sound disinterested. </TEXT>

I have about 24000 songs on my iTunes. I really have a hard time finding those old gems that I like bc there's so much "junk" in there. I guess from when I used to get music off the internet for free. 

Do you have any suggestions on how to reduce your music storage on your computer? 

Right now I'm scrolling through the artists and listening to songs. I'm just having a hard time getting rid of songs! Like, with Backstreet Boys, I don't actively listen to them, but what if I want one of their songs on a running playlist?! How do you make that final get rid of decision? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hip is popping during squats. This has never happened before! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-04-16 17:34:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi ladies. 

I am trying to lose weight and typically do squats at the gym. But I wanted to add some more squats to my routine, so I thought I'd do air squats on my day off at home. 

So every time I'm at the bottom of a squat, the anterior of my right hip pops as I'm standing up! It's never happened before. It doesnt hurt. But I dont want to keep doing the air squats while that's going on, obviously. I've tried stretching before I do the air squats and that doesnt really seem to help. I've tried changing the angle of my toes. I've tried to push my knees out more at the bottom, I've tried to keep them right on top of my toes ... that doesnt help. 

This popping doesnt seem to happen when I lunge. 

And maybe popping isnt the right word. But it feels like there's a sinew in there that's like ... strumming across the front of my hip bone every time I stand up from a deep squat. And when I go back down it goes back in front of the front of the pelvis and as I stand up, it snaps over the front of the pelvis again. I dont know if that makes sense!

I'd feel silly going to the doctor about it. I feel fine. I was really wondering if anyone has experienced it before and if it's a temporary thing that goes away? 

edit: Thank you guys for all the responses. I'll lay low and see where I'm at in a week. I teach yoga so I will look into psoas/hip stretches! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry if this has been beaten into the ground but ... 

People get VERY up in arms (ha, punny) about suggesting id laws for voting. Or, god forbid, a background checks or mental capacity to vote tests ... 

So legally, what makes it okay to suggest this with guns? I know guns can kill people ... but a lot of things can kill people. We're not given a right to drive cars. Driving cars is a privilege (I think). But we are given a right to bear arms. 

I dont know, I guess I need an Explain like I'm 5 thread or something.

hope this makes sense.

I dont know, did I hear that right? What is CrossFit trying to do with the Power Rankings? Is it just for "ties"? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like a common criticism of CrossFit is that you will get injured, its unsafe, etc. 

And talking to some Level 1 Cert people, they bring up how CrossFit Lvl 1 teachers typically say stuff like, "Ppl get injured playing soccer, running, etc". 

So which is it? Is CrossFit unsafe? Or is being "an athlete" generally unsafe? Or some other interpretation? 

And for arguments sake, let's say you go to a "good box" with good trainers. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm about 3 weeks into No Poo and my hair doesnt look worse. So Im sticking with it more. I'd be interested to see what it does during the summer!

How I do it:
A large spoonful of baking soda with about 6 oz of water in [an applicator bottle like this](http://www.sallybeauty.com/Calibrated-Applicator-Bottle/SBS-305925,default,pd.html?cm_vc=SEARCH) to clean.
and all the no poo communities suggest some apple cider vinegar rinse. So I have that too. About 8oz water and 1/10th of it is the vinegar. My hair doesnt smell bad after using (and rinsing) with the vinegar solution. But I'm just not quite sure what the point of the vinegar really is. 

Anyways, when I workout my hair seems not so dirty but my scalp ... ugh! it could use a wash. So I like that baking soda get up bc I feel like I can clean my scalp but not strip my hair and make it dry again. 

I dont know if I'm making sense but I've had a few drinks :D

Also if you are interested in being a mod, dont be like ADD ME LOL and have no skillz. I really want a cute curly haired alien on the top left and I have NO CLUE how to do that.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-12-15 05:30:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I need to drop about 20 lbs. I've gained weight from eating poorly but, at the same time, started doing deadlifts, squats, snatches,etc. This is anecdotal but I remember eating like some gnarly fast food one day and then that night, I broke my deadlift PR by 40 lbs. Eating more helps me lift more. 

Even when I would eat better and lift weights (like 3 weeks or so) I'd still gain weight.

But recently I've stopped lifting weight and my weight is starting to FINALLY come off. I'm 5'10" and a size 12. Average. But I am about 40 lbs heavier than I was when I graduated college. I'd like to lose some of that weight because I'm overweight right now. I can do cooler yoga sh*t when I drop weight. I honestly look better when I lose weight. I have a bad complexion and my skin tends to look better too. This isnt some body dysmorphia thing! 

There's this other girl that I lift weights with who is thin and who lifts weights and she is totally gaining strength but wearing the same clothes that she wore before she started lifting! 

It seems like if you arent lifting, you're a horrible fitness person or something. Like everyone is a strong proponent of having a lifting routine. But when I do, it's like I'm taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back away from my overall fitness goals. Being strong is just one aspect; I want to be a healthy size for me too! It's not about me getting skinny ... it's about not weighing more than guys my height; I dont think that's asking for much. And I would rather do yoga or run than mess with high rep/low weight. If I AM going to lift weight, I dont want to mess with 8 lb dumbbells; I want to lift a bar and move some EFFING WEIGHT AROUND, y'know!

I was just wondering if anyone had thoughts or suggestions. 

TLDR: When I lift weights, I gain weight or have a hard time losing. Now that I've stopped lifting, my weight is starting to come off. Is there a way to lift heavy weights and still lose weight? Or should I drop the weight and then add weightlifting back into my regiment?  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-11-11 22:50:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I got out of shape for about 4 years. 

I've gotten back into doing CrossFit. I love it! My box really focuses on lifting weights. We dont do a lot of the "metcon" type workouts. But I feel fitter. Last year I couldnt run a mile. A few weeks ago I ran a Ragnar type relay and was able to run my 3 and 4 mile legs with no running type training. I just showed up, was pumped up, and I did it!

But one thing that's a big bummer is that I keep gaining weight. I swear, after every period, I've gained 2 lbs and it never comes off. My pants are getting tighter and tighter.

Is there a way to "cut" while I'm lifting so much weight. I definitely have the weight to lose. I dont really want to stop lifting too much. My diet leaves a lot to be desired. Will cutting sugar and fixing my diet do most of it? I'm also 31 years old. So is this just what happens?  Am I going downhill already??l!!!

	<TEXT> Hi! Awhile ago, my super conservative friend said jokingly, "God, I hope there's bad weather election day because liberals won't go out and vote." 

Do you think the weather will really effect one party more than the other?

Will this hurricane effect the vote? I mean, if there was an election right around Katrina time, that would have definitely influenced how many people even showed up to vote. 

Not meaning to be disrespectful or "wishing harm upon libs" ... so if you're reading it that way, I'm telling you that you're mistaken. Just wondering if there are official studies on this or what everyone's opinion is on weather and getting out the vote. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-09-20 00:34:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems like it's socially acceptable among liberals to mock Christians and Mormons (see wildly successful musical: Book of Mormon by Parker/Stone). It's fine. I get free speech and all that. (Hell, even I'd see Book of Mormon if I had the tix!)

But when it comes to Islam, it seems like there are different standards when it comes to speech. At least with the recent request of the White House asking YouTube to remove the video that allegedly sparked the Libyan riots that ended up with our ambassador (and three other people) getting murdered.

Here's the editorial that says this a lot better than I can! [Muslims, Mormons, and Liberals](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444450004578002010241044712.html) (wall street journal)

Why are liberals accepting of Islam but not Christianity? I just don't follow the logic. </TEXT>

Newt, however, might come out swinging. I think he said some great stuff in the debates. I'm interested in what he's got to say. I just hope Calista isnt up there too much.

	<DATE> 2012-08-21 23:19:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Im trying to leave my house in 20 minutes so hopefully this makes some sense!

Leaks - Obama's Cabinet (or someone in his inner circle) has leaked information about Osama raid which resulted in a movie. Versus Romney's - very tight lipped about the VP. 

Cash - Obama's campaign is spending more than he's campaigning. Romney (there are legal reasons for this!) has not. I'd be interested on how they're spending their money.

Romney's cash advantage: http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79920.html?hp=r7_b1
Obama spent more than he made in July: http://www.theindychannel.com/politics/31371858/detail.html



Headquarters - Obama's campaign headquarters are in Chicago ... and they're having a hard time communicating with the West Wing (inefficient and bureaucratic ... trying to keep too many people happy). Havent heard too many complaints about Romney's camp and in-fighting. [source-ish - politico](http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/08/politico-ebook-trouble-in-obamaland-132516.html)

VP pick - Biden vs Paul ... c'mon.


I just see how Rommey is running his campaign and it seems like a fairly robotic thing. Some slip-ups have happened with each but I think Romney's campaign, overall, seems to be more lean and drama-free than Obama's. 

(not specifically managing a campaign but I like how Romney made a comment against Akin versus Obama still backing Holder ... ?) 

This just further encourages me to think Romney is a better leader than Obama.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ME: for my workouts, I casually do crossfit and yoga. I also sign up for 5k's quite a bit. I seem to be in this black hole of running.. I've averaged about a 10:45-11:00 pace per mile over the last 3 years.

I would like to get it down to a number that starts in that 9 minute range. I dont care how long it takes or anything. 

Is this a realistic goal? How would you go about it? I'm 31 if that matters at all.

It's like when I run I'm out there for 40 minutes and I'm working hard but I'm just not seeing any progress with my pace. </TEXT>

NOW they have it by pages. And you have to click next to get from post 1-10 to post 11-20, etc. And you can only rearrange the first 10 posts! After you hit next, it's like they're locked!

I dont know, I have like 30 fucking quotes that I'd like to intersperse with some pics and now I wont Tumblr famous anymore.

	<TEXT> I dont know. Its like you can just say, "[insert someone from other party here] robbed someone at gunpoint!" and the media jumps on it. And if the politician ignores it, the media interprets it to your detriment. And if the politician answers it, you give people reasons to do those types of salacious claims in the future. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

And then concerning Romney's taxes - I have no reason to doubt the fucker paid taxes. If he releases the taxes, we're just going to hear about Romney's "Rafalca"-type tax claims from the early 2000's for the next 3 months. I honestly think that was Harry Reid's motivation.

I just feel like there's starting to be this trend of "Obama isnt a US citizen!" "Romney hasnt paid taxes for 10 years!" People just saying shit. And then we talk about these dumb distractions instead of meaningful issues. 

That's all.

I listen to Boortz, Rush, Hannity (I actually am not a huge fan of his show but it's on when I get off work), Herman Cain, Eric Ericcson, and Savage.

I can really only listen to talk radio in small doses, but I tend to actively seek out Boortz (I'm from Atlanta) and Savage.  On the east coast, Boortz is on in the a.m. so he's my go-to in the a.m.

I just discovered that Dennis Miller has a radio show, so I need to check him out. I've tried to listen to Beck, but I just don't "get" his show.

I really LIKE Jamie Dupree though. He doesnt have a radio show but he's a great, unbiased reporter! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-07-20 08:04:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not sure where to post this but this seems as good as spot as any. I dont think guys in the generic fitness groups will get it. 

And this will probably be a long post. I think it'll help just typing it out.

MY GYM: Okay so I'm a crossfitter. I pay over $100/month to go to my "box". I know certain people have strong anti-Crossfit feelings but I love doing Crossfit. And I love this box especially. There are maybe 3 Crossfit boxes that I would probably actually drive to on a regular basis and I've already tried out one of the other ones (for over 2 years). This is my 2nd box and I LOVE the progamming and people that own it. Like, they invite some of us to concerts, we do local 5ks together, etc. So it's more than "just a gym" to me. (And Im not trying to whore out Crossfit. I LOVED my old globo gym - Crunch, I LOVED Crunch - when I went there in the 90's. LOVED. IT.)

WORK: I work for a manufacturing company. I work in the lab. And I have to walk through the warehouse area to do my job and go talk to other departments. The hierarchy looks a little like this (we're small): Owner, dept heads, managers (thats me), full-times, and when we're busy we bring anywhere from 1 to 40 temporary workers. So I NEVER talk to temps. I dont have any in the lab that's a temp (bc temps tend to be under-qualified for what I need them to do; I typically hire college grads). And I am not in the habit to talking to them because if I ask them to do something, that might contradict what THEIR manager told them. They come and go anyways so we hardly get most of their names.

THE CREEPER: So there's this one temp that is there maybe 1/3 of the time. And lets just be honest here for a second ... if he were within 10 years of my age and attractive, this wouldnt be a reddit post. The guys in the warehouse think he's a great worker (therefore, a great guy). But the girl in Shipping/Receiving (she's the only full-time female that works in the warehouse that sees the temps) ... she also says there's a creeper vibe about him.

Again I dont pay much attention to the temps. But if they say "hi" or something, I respond appropriately. So he's said hi to me off and on for over a year. When I walk by him, he will stop what he's doing (and it's a mfg company, stuff is flying at you), will stare at me until I look at him, then he'll wave. 

Like, a year ago, he struck up a 3 min convo with me and told me he owned a gym. I told him I taught yoga. And he was like - oh, you should teach for us. And I was like "I'm busy enough but thanks gotta go!" So last month, he tells me he has something for me (on the inside I'm like "fuck! what?"). It's a yoga shirt (definitely not new, has stains on it ...). I say thanks and take the shirt and go back to my office. 

So cut to today and I am done with Crossfit. One of the Crossfit trainers tells me this martial arts guy dropped by and told the trainer that he knew me. And I was like ... who do I know that does martial arts? I think of the guy I knew that did MMA but that wasnt him. And the Crossfit trainer tells me the guy was like "yeah, i just saw her shirt while she was walking by and thought I'd check out the place". And I had wore my Crossfit shirt to work last week! We chatted further and I found out IT WAS THAT TEMP FROM WORK.

Like, I am pretty good friends with the boss of the temp's manager (the head of manufacturing). And I can't even vent to the head of mfg because he might just DNR that temp (that means "do not return" .. the temp in essence will be fired). The temp is a good worker, he hasnt done anything wrong so I just dont want to risk it. The head of mfg is quick to DNR temps because they are so easy to replace. (but the head of mfg might think it's  hilarious and not take it seriously at all either).

But on the other hand, if that temp starts hanging out by my Crossfit gym, I WILL BE PISSED. It's at a pretty busy strip mall with a bar, coffee shop, etc. So it wouldnt be odd for him to chill out there (but I always hang out in that area ... and I've NEVER seen him there). And, OMG, if he joins the Crossfit gym, I will talk to the owner. I feel bad but I would have to go to another Crossfit gym! The box owner just opened up the Crossfit gym so I wouldnt want him to lose a new customer. But I want to have fun when I work out. There's only about 5-10 ppl working out at the gym at the same time. And we're all doing the same thing! I cant just avoid the guy if he joins.

I am sure  nothing will come of this, but Jesus seriously? Leave my Crossfit gym alone, creeper! I have to tell someone! I dont want to talk to the owner just yet (I'm sure if it came down to me or the creeper, he'd want me at the gym; i'm a loyal customer and I'm awesome). 

I dont know, thanks for reading if you got this far. Any Creeper experiences at the gym would be appreciated. Or advice! I like to have a plan. So I tend to map out possible things that are likely to happen and my possible reaction. Like a Choose Your Own Adventure.

TLDR: i wore my crossfit shirt to work last week. today this temporary employee at my job showed up at my crossfit gym (I was not there) asking about crossfit. he's kind of creepy (and this other girl at work has verified his creepiness). but i could be overreacting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found this video of a workout where you did 50 Ninja PopUps
[youtube.com/watch?v=OW0JBaL27Kw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW0JBaL27Kw feature=player_embedded)

[Here's her channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/HangTightwMarC?feature=watch)

And then clicked on her channel and she seems to have a nice little collection there including 100 rep workouts, yoga/pilates, warm up/cool down, AMRAP, TABATA, HIIT (?), etc. 

Just thought I'd share. (Again, I just skimmed I didnt do any like ... investigation of the content!)
Peace holler. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Another article on Mangold (350 lbs Olympic weightlifter).  </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-06-23 05:05:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just really liked some of the excerpts from this New York Times article: [Shes 350 Pounds and Olympics-Bound](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/magazine/shes-350-pounds-and-olympics-bound.html?_r=2 hp)! Sorry for the powerlifting randomness. My intention isnt really to talk about if she's healthy or not (I think there was a thread a week or so back where that came up) but if it happens, it happens. I can seeing it happen because there's just so much talk about size in this article.

But I'm really just intrigued about females in the powerlifting world.  Like, females in general don't like being "big". But there seems to be a lifting advantage if you're "bigger" in powerlifting. I just wonder how that effects women in powerlifting.

I have just met a female powerlifter (who has a great ass, btw and no one would think she's fat if you looked at her) and knowing her helps me feel more fearless around barbells. She goes to this gym that only has weights (maybe a rower or treadmill) - barbells, bumpers and racks/cages (I dont know what they're called). She works out in friend's garages. It's just totally bad-a!

Anyways here's some excerpts 

"When she squats, which she can do with 525 pounds on her shoulders, she looks almost wholly like an egg."

It's true ... serious lifters like that get ass to calves in squats.

"The whole sport of Olympic weight lifting in the United States is scruffy: no money, low participation; its our Jamaican bobsled team."


"Meanwhile, Mangold dangled from a chin-up bar to stretch her back. Id like to see the other 350-pound ladies try this, she said."


"Not all lifters are big, but the women who compete in the 75-kilo-plus category tend to be huge. Mangold enjoys this. I dont want to be small, she said. That would be awful. Nobody remembers the skinny girls name. Understandably, she would like to be known as an Athena, not a behemoth, so she makes a constant string of weight-lifting jokes. Have you seen my beach ball? Its about this big  raises arms into a circle around her head, flexing her biceps  and it went that way  swivels right hand and left foot, flexing triceps and calf."


[I guess the writer is talking about a snatch here]
"Shes just hoping for that feeling when the lift comes together, when her body goes down and the bar floats up. Its like peace, theres no struggle, Mangold said. Thats what were all searching for, that feeling of weightlessness."

(I found that last sentence kind of ironic-ish ... seeing how's she's bulked up to 350 lbs to attain a feeling of weightlessness.)

	<TEXT> I personally am confused about what Obama expects to happen. You are going to not deport the young people. But are their parents' fair game? If so, that is retarded. I would think you'd rather keep a fam together than have one of the kids live in the USA while their parents get on a plane back to Mexico.

"This is not amnesty" 
You sure about that?

Anyways, I am one of those people that believe the USA should have sovereign borders. And if you sneak in here ... you gotta deal with the consequences. 

But it's our own fault. You can't have all that open, unprotected border and not expect illegal immigration to happen like it has. 
I remember reading something that Mexico has a fast growing economy (like on par with Brazil in terms of growth). Maybe we should go there for jobs ...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just saw this movie last night. I knew it was about a Parisian Child Protection Unit. I didnt really know much about it after that. It's just one of those movies that started off kind of meh but then you get sucked into it. And the laughs are genuine and the lows are low. . . . 

Has anyone else seen it? I think it even won something at Cannes.
Hopefully a theater is showing it around you! </TEXT>
