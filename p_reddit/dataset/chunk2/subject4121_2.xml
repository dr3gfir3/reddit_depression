	<TEXT> Trade him to LSU for Fournette and Les Miles. The Eagles trade Murray and Mathews to Buffalo. Buffalo sends Murray, Mathews and Tyrod Taylor to Browns for Manziel. Rex Ryan and Manziel are finally together thus ruining football forever in Buffalo. The Bills move to St. Louis once they leave for California and football is forever ruined for my best friend who is also a huge Bills fan and can never be happy when I'm not.

	<TEXT> Absolutely.  I was flipping through the MSM "news" outlets and HOLY FUCK, the fear mongering strong with these ones.
      Nothing but "ISIS is going to attack D.C. and the rest of america"  and "We need more boots on the ground" and all the military "experts" saying our military is only 30% ready to go to battle because they need more money for training and that the military is being severely underfunded.
  It was hilarious. TPTB don't even have to try anymore. It's right in front of our face yet nothing will or can be done. The masses have spoken. Convenience over confrontation. 

America is a joke, filled with people whose anger and empathy reaches only as far as their ethernet cables.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There's a lot of underlying shit going on with this "terrorist" attack. This is to see who all is on the "I fucking hate brown people" team in order to see who our allies potentially are when we go up against China and Russia and the ME. This is just the start of what's gonna be a loooong, bloody(ier) ordeal in my opinion.
We will get into a small Vietnam in the middle east as the crude barons try one last time to take control of the oil while our dependence on it gets less and less. That will upset china. They will hit the button and tank the dollar. America will have no choice but to show its military might because it's all they have. Russia will join China and the ME because they are just looking for the right opportunity to kick America in the dick. America will have the "I hate brown people" countries and all will go to war. Japan is on our side so we can use them logistically to fight China and Turkey is too for the same reasons.  Just my ramblings. Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why is everyone angry Bevin won? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-04 22:02:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To all the people who are all riled up about Bevin winning....Why get mad now? Of course he was going to fucking win! Seriously think about it. Do you recall any social media posts about how important it is to keep Bevin out of office prior to like 5 days ago? No. To the people who blame voter turn out for this, you are WRONG. How can someone buy something they have no idea is for sale? How can people vote if they don't know there's an election? You can't. There was an independent study done at the campus of U of L and only 12% of the student body even knew there was an election. The blame lies in the horribly run campaigns and most importantly the blame falls on US. Where we're all the anti-Bevin posts a week ago, a month ago or 4 months ago?! How many of you canvassed the streets w/ the message "Keep Bevin Out" and told everyone there was an election coming up and if you're poor this Bevin guy will let you die in order to line his master's pockets? And how many of you just watched a John Oliver segment and decided to get angry when it was too late? People vote just so they can feel like they aren't part of the problem when shit hits the fan. Well you ARE part of the problem. You have to get out there and evoke real change instead of just sitting behind a computer talking to like minded individuals about how liberal you are. This Bevin is a real piece of shit...and right now we ALL deserve every year of him.

      But don't worry, none of this really matters. Soon China will finally collapse the U.S. dollar and we will head into a second Vietnam in the middle east to make up for it. And all that should eat up enough time and resources to be weak when China decides it wants to go to war, with the whole support of the world behind them. So cheer up, and forget about Bevin because things will get a lot worse. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who gives a flying fuck about some Kathy Bates in Misery, outfit wearing bigot from Kentucky! I wish people got as mad at the real issues like the TPP, extension of the Patriot Act, the fact an evil man is buying the water in California for $524 just to sell it back to people in bottle form, etc etc, as they do with some dime a dozen bigot. Where was all the angry posts then? Everybody gets so worked up about micro-aggressors and divisive issues that they are blind to the actual fucked up shit that's happening right under their nose. Assholes like this woman aren't going away no matter what anyone does. All you do by posting shit about her is add fuel to the fire and increase her popularity. If you want people like that to stop having an effect on people and to go away then stop posting shit about her. Ignore people like that and it takes away their influence. This is why nothing gets done in this country. People are too worried about the color of dresses, Caitlyn Jenner's dick, a murdered Lion, a racist flag, some homophobic bitch in KY, Ashley Madison and whatever other bullshit the media decides they want you to get mad at. Wake the fuck up people.....or don't. This country is probably fucked beyond repair, anyways. And it's been a collective effort to make it this way. We are all at fault. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...and there never will be IMO. If this was just some "nut" then it would be in the mainstream media. The man had 1200 guns, 7 tons of ammo, 14 car(with one SUV being able to drive underwater), multiple houses and a ton of cash. There is no evidence he got them illegally but they can't determine or won't determine how he acquired all of it. All this plus his girlfriend and her family's reaction to all this makes for some damn fine entertainment and it keeps getting better by the hour. </TEXT>

"Hey Bryce, you know that old muscle dude that was the governor of California? You know, the one in all those old explosion movies or whatever?"

Bryce:  (mum)shit.  Yes, Gabe, I do."

Gabe: "Well I've been wanting to tell you for some time now but I've had this strange, recurring memory of mom forcing us to go piss next to him, after we had just went, at some rest-stop bathroom while she took our picture."

Bryce: "Here, have another beer."

Gabe: "Something else happened that day, man." "Something bad."

Bryce: "We need to talk Gabe." "Why don't you sit down." </TEXT>
