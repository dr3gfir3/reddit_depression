	<TEXT> In all, the Trump campaigns payments to Trump-owned businesses account for about 7 percent of its $119 million spending total, the analysis found.

Thats an unprecedented amount of self-dealing in federal politics. Even the wealthiest of candidates have refrained from tapping their businesses resources to such an extensive degree, either because their businesses are structured in a manner that doesnt legally allow them to do it with flexibility, or because theyre leery of the allegations of pocket-padding that inevitably arise when politicians use their campaigns or committees to pay their businesses or families.

Difference being that many of those other candidates actually give a tin shit about appearances (and a handful of them also about ethics), not just cramming their pockets full of money.

	<TEXT> C. exigua extracts blood through the claws on its front, causing the tongue to atrophy from lack of blood. The parasite then replaces the fish's tongue by attaching its own body to the muscles of the tongue stub.  The fish is able to use the parasite just like a normal tongue. It appears that the parasite does not cause any other damage to the host fish. Once C. exigua replaces the tongue, some feed on the host's blood and many others feed on fish mucus.[clarification needed] This is the only known case of a parasite functionally replacing a host organ. When a host fish dies, C. exigua will detach itself from the tongue stub after some time, leave the fish's mouth cavity, and can then be seen clinging to its head or body externally. It is not fully known what then happens to the parasite in the wild.

	<TEXT> St. Vitalis of Assisi, O.S.B. (Italian: San Vitale de Assisi) (1295  May 31, 1370), was an Italian hermit and monk. Born in Bastia Umbra, Vitalis as a youth was licentious and immoral. However, he attempted to expiate his sins by going on pilgrimage to various sanctuaries in Italy and Europe. When he returned to Umbria, he became a Benedictine monk at Subiaco.

Vitalis then spent the rest of his life in the hermitage of Santa Maria di Viole, near Assisi, in utter poverty. His one possession was an old container that he used to drink water from a nearby spring. His reputation for holiness soon spread after his death. He was known as a patron against sicknesses and diseases affecting the bladder and genitals.

On 29 May 2011, a head preserved as a relic, allegedly that of this saint, was offered at auction with an estimate of 1,000 at Annesbrook House, Duleek, County Meath, Ireland. It was sold to an unnamed movie star from Los Angeles, California, for 3,500.

	<TEXT> This was the scene of [Heirens' second murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Heirens#Murders):

On December 10, 1945, Frances Brown, a divorced woman, was discovered with a knife lodged in her neck and bullet wound to the head in her apartment at 3941 North Pine Grove Avenue, Chicago, after a cleaning woman heard a radio playing loudly and noted Brown's partly open door. Brown had been savagely stabbed, and authorities thought that a burglar had been discovered or interrupted. No valuables were taken, but someone had written a message in lipstick on the wall of Brown's apartment:

**For heavens
Sake catch me
Before I kill more
I cannot control myself**

Police found a bloody fingerprint smudge on the doorjamb of the entrance door. Also, there was a possible eyewitness to the killer's escape. An "eye-witness", George Weinberg, heard gunshots at about 4 am. According to John Derick, the night clerk stationed in the lobby of the building, a nervous man of 3540 years old and weighing approximately 140 pounds got off the elevator, fumbled for the door to the street and left.

Four days after the murder, the Chicago Police announced they had reason to believe the killer was a woman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The price has increased 450 percent since 2004, when a dose cost $100 in today's dollars, to its current price of more than $600. Many consumers hadn't noticed the gradual rise in price, however, because the company often only added in 9 to 15 percent each time and insurance companies had made up the difference. But with recent changes in the deductible structure and co-pays for some health plans that have put more of the cost for drugs on consumers, many families have been hit with sticker shock. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hilliard):

(happened in Minnesota)

On December 20, 1980, Jean Hilliard was involved in a car accident which resulted in car failure in sub zero temperatures. She walked to a friend's house 2 miles away and collapsed 15 feet outside of the door. Temperatures dropped to -22 F (-30 C) and she was found frozen solid at 7 a.m. after six hours in the cold. She was transported to Fosston Hospital where doctors said her skin was too hard to pierce with a hypodermic needle and her body temperature was too low to register on a thermometer. Her face was ashen and her eyes were solid with no response to light. Her pulse was slowed to approximately 12 beats per minute.


She was wrapped in an electric blanket. After 49 days she left the hospital with no permanent damage to the brain or body besides frostbite.

	<TEXT> To maintain the precise condition of Lenin's body, the staff must perform regular maintenance on the corpse and sometimes even replace parts with an excruciating attention to detail. Artificial eyelashes have taken the place of Lenin's original eyelashes, which were damaged during the initial embalming procedures. The lab had to deal with mold and wrinkles on certain parts of Lenin's body, especially in the early years. Researchers developed artificial skin patches when a piece of skin on Lenin's foot went missing in 1945. They resculpted Lenin's nose, face and other parts of the body to restore them to their original feel and appearance. A moldable material made of paraffin, glycerin and carotene has replaced much of the skin fat to maintain the original landscape of the skin. </TEXT>

U.S. gold medal swimmer Ryan Lochte was robbed in a taxi hold-up in Rio de Janeiro after leaving a party where he had been celebrating the end of the Olympic swimming program, he told fellow competitor Thiago Pereira.

A spokesman for Brazilian Pereira told Reuters on Sunday Pereira had called Lochte after hearing reports the U.S. swimmer had been the victim of a gun-point robbery the night before.

"Thiago and his wife went yesterday night to a birthday party for a common friend with Lochte in the France House," the spokesman said.

"He parted ways with Lochte when he returned to his hotel with his wife.

"Today in the morning he received the news about Lochtes incident, so he called him and Lochte told him he was fine and said the taxi he was in got robbed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The plant works by moving large volumes of air through a piece of equipment where CO2 is absorbed by a liquid solution, and then transformed into pellets of calcium carbonate. The pellets are then heated to 800 or 900 degrees Celsius and break down, releasing pure carbon.

"There's no real magic to it," Corless said. "The pieces of equipment already exist today in very large scale. And we've really adapted them from other industries."

It may not be magic, but it is innovative  Carbon Engineering is a world leader in direct-air carbon capture, Corless said.

Soon the company will take the technology even farther, building another system that will turn the captured carbon into useable transportation fuel by adding hydrogen from renewable sources, such as solar, wind or hydro. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Much of Uday's notoriety abroad stemmed from his position as head of the National Iraqi Olympic Committee, which was accused of torturing and jailing athletes.

The London-based human rights group Indict said the committee once made a group of track athletes crawl on newly poured asphalt while they were beaten and threw some of them off a bridge. Indict also said Uday ran a special prison for athletes who offended him. The International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, said earlier this year that it was investigating the allegations.

One defector told Indict that jailed soccer players were forced to kick a concrete ball after failing to reach the 1994 World Cup finals. Another defector said athletes were dragged through a gravel pit and then dunked in a sewage tank so infection would set in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashi-Dorzho_Itigilov):

Itigilov left a testament asking to be buried as he was at the time of his death, sitting in lotus posture. According to his wishes, his body was put into a pine box and interred at a bumkhan (a graveyard for the lama burials) in the locality of Khukhe-Zurkhen (Dark-blue Heart in Buryat language). One of the testament clauses stipulated that his body should be exhumed by other monks within several years.

In 1955 and in 1973, Itigilov's body was examined by Buddhist monks, who were astonished to observe no signs of decay. They were too reluctant to divulge their finding to the anti-religious authorities of the Soviet Union and the body remained in situ until 2002.

On September 11, 2002, Itigilov's body was eventually exhumed in the presence of the leaders of the Buddhist Traditional Sangha of Russia. The body was transferred to Ivolginsky datsan (a residence of todays Hambo Lama) where it was closely examined by monks as well as by scientists and pathologists. The official statement was issued about the body  it was "in the condition of someone who had died 36 hours ago", very well preserved, without any signs of decay, with whole muscles and inner tissue, soft joints and skin.

A report by Al Jazeera states that the body had been preserved by being packed in salt and shows recent footage of the body being removed from this salt, although the reporter was not clear about when the salt was first applied.

The Buddhist monks approach him as a living person and shake hands with him. Some devotees even claim that Itigilov is still alive, only immersed in a hibernation- or nirvana-like state.

On April twenty-third, 2003, the Buddhist conference recognized the body of Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov as one of the sacred Buddhist objects of Russia. At that time, they laid the foundation stone for a temple entitled Itigel Khambyn ordon and consecrated to Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov. As of 2005, Itigilov's body was kept out of doors, in contact with other people, without preserving any temperature or humidity regimens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For Harriet Jacobs, escaping slavery meant hiding for several years in a prison of her own devising. Born a slave in North Carolina, Jacobs spent her teenage years living in fear of a cruel master who refused to let her marry and made repeated and increasingly brutal sexual advances toward her. When the harassment continued even after Jacobs had two children by another man, she resolved to make a break for freedom. In 1835, she fled her plantation and briefly hid in some friends houses. Knowing her chances of making it to the North were slim, she eventually holed up in a small attic crawlspace in her grandmothers home. The rat-infested room was tinyonly nine feet long and seven feet wide, with a sloping ceiling that never reached higher than three feetand Jacobs later wrote that it offered no admission for either light or air. Nevertheless, she would spend an astonishing seven years living in the coffin-like space, watching her children play in the yard through a small peephole and only leaving for brief periods of nighttime exercise.

Jacobs finally made her escape to the North in 1842, after a friend helped her secure passage on a boat bound for Philadelphia. From there, she proceeded by train to New York and reunited with family members. She spent the next few years working in New York and Boston, but remained wary of being captured by her former master until friends helped arrange her purchase and manumission. Jacobs later became an influential abolitionist and published a searing account of her ordeal called Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hammurabis Code took a brutal approach to justice, but the severity of criminal penalties often depended on the identity of both the lawbreaker and the victim. While one law commanded, If a man knock out the teeth of his equal, his teeth shall be knocked out, committing the same crime against a member of a lower class was punished with only a fine. Other rank-based penalties were even more significant. If a man killed a pregnant maid-servant, he was punished with a monetary fine, but if he killed a free-born pregnant woman, his own daughter would be killed as retribution. The Code also listed different punishments for men and women with regard to marital infidelity. Men were allowed to have extramarital relationships with maid-servants and slaves, but philandering women were to be bound and tossed into the Euphrates along with their lovers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The unique multi-hued bark is the most distinctive feature of the tree. Patches of outer bark are shed annually at different times, showing a bright green inner bark. This then darkens and matures to give blue, purple, orange and then maroon tones. The previous seasons bark peels off in strips to reveal a brightly colored new bark below. The peeling process results in vertical streaks of red, orange, green, blue and gray.

	<TEXT> From last month:

A Dutch foundation developing technology to remove waste plastics from the worlds oceans has launched a working North Sea prototype.

The organisation said that the prototype is the first ocean cleanup system ever tested at sea.

Two of The Ocean Cleanups main partners, the Dutch government, and dredging and marine contractor Royal Boskalis Westminster N.V., were represented at the unveiling.

The prototype has been installed in the North Sea, 23 km (12 NM) off the Dutch coast, where it will remain for one year. The objective is to test how The Ocean Cleanups floating barrier fares in extreme weather at sea  the kind of conditions the system will eventually face when deployed in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

The 100m long barrier segment deployed in the North Sea will help validate the survivability of the system.

	<TEXT> From [another source](http://www.biblio.com/blog/2011/01/bloody-books-a-strange-collection/):

My life has been full of dangers in which I should have lost a lot of bloodbut since I have bled only a little, I asked somebody to write Gods words with my blood in gratitude, President Saddam Hussein said in a letter published by the Iraqi official media in 2000.

Since the fall of Baghdad, most of the statues and other public displays erected by the fallen dictator have been dismantled and removed, but as it is also haraam to throw out or destroy copies of the Quran, the Iraqi government is uncertain how to proceed with this very strange and very powerful book.  It is so touchy a situation that to be allowed to view the Bloody Quran requires approval from a committee, and the three keys that open the vault are secretly hidden throughout Iraq.

The exquisitely crafted book will remain under lock and key until the government committee on historical artifacts and the dubious legacy of Saddam Hussein decides how to proceed with this unique work of religious art. </TEXT>
