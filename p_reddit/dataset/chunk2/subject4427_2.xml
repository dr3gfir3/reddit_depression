	<TEXT> I suspect they will try to shove this through quickly. Like healthcare, the more people learned about it, the less they liked it. Look how fast the internet bill went through... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The store's 45yr old manager, who was married with kids, was caught banging a 16yr old cashier. Needless to say he was not the manager for very long after that. Sad part was he probably took advantage of other underage girl while working there before he got caught.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't understand why the White House doesn't comply. If I were them, I would use Flynn as a scapegoat- his goose is already cooked. By denying this request, it looks more and more like a bad coverup by an incompetent, corrupt administration.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, Im not a mechanic. Now that that disclaimer is out of the way, I had this happen to me on another Toyota. You need an axle puller. You can rent one for free from one of the auto parts stores (I think it was advanced auto). Its still a bear- Good Luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello student loan gurus, I previously used your services to help my girlfriend (now wife) make some headway on on her (now our) student loans. They are (all variable rates):

Navient (Public)- $55,000 total over 6 loans.
3 subsidized at 6.8% interest ($17,000) and 3 which are unsubsidized: (1.) $14,500 @ 6.8% (2.) $20,000 @ 6.8% (3.) $18,000 @ 5.625%

NJ Class Managed by HESAA (Private)- $69,000 Total over 6 loans. 2 loans currently in repayment totaling $13,200 @ 7.2%. 1 loan currently in repayment totaling $3,600 @ 6.74%. 2 loans currently in repayment totaling $28,400@ 6.5%. 1 loan currently in repayment totaling $23,700 @ 6.7%.

So in total we have $123,000 total owed. We recieved an offer from Navient to refinance and consolidate all of her loans at a fixed 4.65%. This reduces the payment from $1600 to $1300 per month and is a 10 year plan. This seems pretty good, however, she is currently working as postdoc at a state university and has an offer to stay on as a assistant professor. I know that some public loans can be forgiven, however, I am not sure that in 120 payments, there will be enough left on the loan to justify the higher interest rate. I am wondering if it makes more sense to consolidate everything or keep the public loans separate? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately that site just gives me "USA" as a location. I used another IP address site and it says Plainfield, New Jersey (which is next to New York). This would explain the New York channels.  However, this is not where I am actually located.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been using Sling TV for a week and it worked well. I was receiving local Philadelphia stations. Yesterday, I started receiving New York stations. I called the sling tv support and the representative said that the IP address determines the location. However, my location, internet connection, and connected devices did not change. Any ideas on how to get back the local stations? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. The park is well lit and there are people at night. It is up against a police station so it seems pretty safe. Most people show up just before sunset.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been going there every day for about a week. Mostly normal spawns but the occasional Parasect, Weepinbell, Pikachu or Tauros. I did get a Nidoqueen and Snorlax there. It is a small park and the Pokestops are very close together so you can generate XP quickly. It is full of people even at 11PM at night.  </TEXT>
