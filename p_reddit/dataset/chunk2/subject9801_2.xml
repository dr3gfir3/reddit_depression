These same Christians who think it's 100% cool to baptize kids at public schools would absolutely shit out the entire chick-fil-a cow if the local muslim imam even tried to come to the school to merely pray with the students. 

They don't believe in freedom of all religions, they believe in freedom of THEIR religion.  </TEXT>

Not saying your average person is going to leave narcotics lying around for their dog to chew on... but that's just as hilarious as saying that stoners are going to leave their weed out for their pets to eat. That shit is too expensive to waste! </TEXT>

Our government **bailed Wells Fargo out with 25 billion dollars.** Yes, they paid it back, but they still needed 25 billion of taxpayer money to repair the damage they had done. [Source.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-tarp-idUSTRE5BM2U720091223)

	<TEXT> This involves more than just voting. There's a huge difference between a pastor urging his congregants to vote a certain way and allowing churches to actively campaign (organize, fundraise, etc.) on behalf of politicians and issues. 

Repealing the Hyde Amendment would allow churches to essentially function as superPACs on behalf of the religious right. That's no good.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Secondly, picketing a church is a good way to get arrested depending on the theopolitical stance of local LEOs. Especially in smaller towns, Jesus salesmen are made men.

A few years back, I think it was during the 2012 primary, Rick Santorum was having a rally at a local church. For context, this rally was held in a city that was [once voted](http://www.onenewsnow.com/church/2016/01/24/and-america-s-most-least-bible-minded-city-is) the most "Bible minded" in the country. 

A friend held up a sign that said "My vagina, my choice," and the word vagina was painted in red. 

I held up a sign that said "tax my weed, reduce my student loan interest." 

Neither of us got arrested, and we were on the sidewalk directly in front of the church. 

Political speech is pretty soundly protected. Any arrest resulting from that type of *peaceful* protest is likely going to result in a costly lawsuit for the city/county.  </TEXT>

It's a conflict of interest to support candidates who promise you things, eh? So every millionaire who votes Republican because they promise to lower taxes, in the same way, has a conflict of interest? 

Or is it only the poor you wish to disenfranchise when they support candidates who help their specific situation? 

What you said here is essentially this: "My ideas can never win if poor people are allowed to vote, so I have to find a *creative idea* to disenfranchise them." If your ideas are so shitty you can't win unless you take away people's right to vote, you should never hold elected office.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eliminating the Dept. of Ed. and returning most education standards to the states would be a disaster. Do you honestly think that states like Mississippi and Texas wouldn't immediately start teaching that Noah's Ark was for real, evolution is BS, creationism is science and that the civil war *wasn't* about slavery? 

If we let all 50 states develop their own curriculum, what happens when a kid from bumfuck Alabama makes it to the University of Chicago and has no clue what about *real* biology or *real* history?

Doing away with national standards would lead to inconsistencies and disparities in education around the country.  </TEXT>

Sure, one vote for one candidate out of 430+ Representatives and 100 Senators is pretty meaningless. **But one vote in favor of a statewide ballot initiative could make a difference.**  </TEXT>

Arizona passed a medical marijuana ballot initiative in 2010. 2010 was a midterm election, and the year that the republicans won big nationwide, and in Arizona. 

If medical marijuana can pass in a midterm election, I think recreational has a very good chance of passing in a presidential election year.  </TEXT>
