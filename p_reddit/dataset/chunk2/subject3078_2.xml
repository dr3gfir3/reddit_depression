	<DATE> 2014-05-20 12:44:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Thank you for all your questions and I hope we managed answer most of them - Maria, George and Jack will drop back in and answer some of the remaining ones as and when (and you know how to get hold of them directly if you want to), they are off to deal with the last two days of campaigning now!

I'd just like to say it's been fun, really busy, some great questions and please remember, that if you are in the EU go and vote for someone you believe in on polling day!

------


Hi Everyone,


The three of us [Maria](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/maria-aretoulaki) (/u/PiratePartyUKMaria), [George](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/george-walkden) (/u/drgwalkden)  and [Jack](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/jack-allnutt) (/u/m2ys4u) are standing in the North West of England for the European Parliamentary Elections.


So, ask us anything!

(And then go and vote for us on the 22nd. Obviously).


----

OK, so our candidates have been going at this for about 5 hours now, thanks for all the questions so far, I'm just adding a note to say that Maria has to go to a pane event on immigration to make the parties case and will get back to your questions later (and probably tomorrow). Jack and George should be around for a while longer. 

I'll also try to make sure any questions not aimed at a candidate get an answer from me, or someone else from the party too!

(Deja-vu? Yes, this was initially posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/260mob/we_are_the_three_uk_candidates_for_the_pirate/) but we ran into some problems with the account it was posted from that we can't easily resolve so it's been removed and recreated here! - Do go and look at what has already been answered, but if we can keep the discussion here that would be great! - /u/subject3078 (I do campaigns stuff for the Pirate Party..)

*Edits: *

To answer a few questions up front :

Our policies are available [on our policy pages](www.pirateparty.org.uk/policy)

Our EU election [pages give an overview of us in this election](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/european-elections-2014)

You can support our EU [election campaign via our crowdfunding effort]
http://www.pozible.com/project/180266) 

Last but not least, a lot of our [campaigns material, including posters featuring all of the three candidates are available too](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/activists/materials) - Feel free to take, adapt, reuse and share (or, if you support us,  print and display..!)

Oh, and somewhat remiss not to include this, but - [You can Join the party and get involved (which includes standing in elections...) here](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/join). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> UK Pirate Party makes the switch to Drupal </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-28 16:36:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I thought this might be appropriate here - The UK Pirate Party switched to Drupal and relaunched its website today (soft launch a week ago, pre-release for about 2 weeks and its been in development since around a year ago - lots of things got in the way!).

I lead that effort and thought I'd share a few things.

Firstly, what we needed.  It probably won't surprise anyone here, but the requirements for something that can be volunteer built, run and managed but also be the core of a political parties IT infrastructure are pretty complex.  

We needed something that first and foremost was a CMS, its all about the content! but it also had to be capable of a few other things too, not least managing our membership, handling mails outs for subscribers members and press, running internal elections, taking payments and donations (and reporting them sensibly), promoting events, and a whole host of other things.  Drupal was selected after looking at all of the available open source CMS's out there.

We also made a decision that for the build we wanted to do as little coding as possible - not because we didn't have the skills in house, or volunteers who desperately wanted to write code, but because we wanted something maintainable and easy to get people to transition on to.  So, apart from the theme and a few tens of patches to other modules (only included if they were accepted..) that's what we did.  No custom code (except a single one off script to migrate users...), no new in house modules.  Of course we use views heavily and there is a bit of using modules as glue, but you could replicate the whole site tomorrow with a list of modules and the theme.

The end result was quite a lot of work, finding a way of running concurrent development and future 'live' systems, trying to get a group of volunteer developers to complete specific tasks on a platform that doesn't lend itself that well to version control and generally working to find combinations of modules and work around to do what we needed.  I'd argue its usually harder to keep things simple than anything else, but that was the aim.

Given [pirateparty.org.uk](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk) is a fairly high traffic site, we also had to look at performance, with our IT lead putting in a lot of time working out how best to deploy drupal on Debian, with nginx in a redundant manner..  But hey, there is lots of documentation and a good community so its more than doable.

Now, the end result isn't earth shattering (and we are now working on phase 2 requirements) but it looks like its going to work very well for us and change the way we have been working for a long time.  It means we can get volunteers in more easily to help us manage and maintain the site and, its going to reduce the amount of time we expend on web related stuff by an order of magnitude.  On our old Django site, a press release took easily 20 minutes to format and publish, blogs and articles took a lot of time to complete, contacting members, donors and others was not-trivial and making even minor adjustments was a pain.  Now it takes us 2 minutes to publish something we have prepared, mail sending can be largely automated, membership management and review is easy.

All in all thanks to Drupal (and Debian, Nginx etc..) we are going to be able to do more of the stuff that we are here to do - campaign and make a difference politically in the UK.  Oh, and after 1 a year of this I can absolutely say that I love   hate Drupal with a passion..

	<TEXT> And the missing poster with more details is here - https://twitter.com/Syncosia/status/414367260086927360/photo/1.  However Millie went missing a couple of days ago after (IIRC) another dog had a go at her.  She might still have her lead attached and may have been injured. 

(For clarity, she's not my dog - this is sort of an extension of the twitter word of mouth that's been going on - I live way down the hill and took my kids out for a look and I've been talking to dog walkers but the more people out and aware the better). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would anyone be interested if we could get an AMA from a Sheffield MP? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-15 13:51:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not sure if I can arrange it, but if I can is there any interest? /r/ukpolitics may be a better bet, but I figured for Sheffield MP's there may be some interest (we have a large enough community now after all!).  I think Paul Blomfield might be up for it, he's been running public meetings for a while, but I can try all of them...

Any thoughts?

The current crop of MP's for Sheffield are:

* Rt Hon Mr David Blunkett (Brightside and Hillsborough)
* Mr Paul Blomfield (Central)
* Rt Hon Mr Nick Clegg (Hallam)
* Ms Meg Munn (Heeley)
* Mr Clive Betts (Sheffield South East)
* Angela Smith (Penistone and Stocksbridge) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just dropped my X61 down half a flight of stairs... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-17 23:35:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> And its perfectly fine, because its an X series thinkpad... However, it's getting a little long in the tooth and I've been looking to see what might work as a sensible upgrade path - however, it seems that there isn't a huge amount of performance to be gained from newer models, there doesn't appear to be anything with a 4:3 screen nor anything without a touchpad on the palm rest...  Not to mention that the X230 I managed to borrow feels a lot more fragile (and less compact somehow..). Am I missing something, or does anyone have any recommendations?  Durability is a huge factor for me so if the newer models are less robust it would probably make more sense to stick with the X61s..

*edit: I should say, I'm in the UK...*
