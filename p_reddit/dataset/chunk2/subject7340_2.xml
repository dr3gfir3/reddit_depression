	<TITLE> For the Love of Tractors </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-06 18:59:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So there's this guy who reaaaally loves tractors. He had tractor toys, he read tractor weekly, he has tractor posters on his wall.... the works. He spent all his time consumed with tractors. So naturally, his mother got worried. She convinced him to go to the local bar to try and meet someone. 

So he reluctantly goes to the bar and, miraculously, he finds a woman who loves tractors too. (Not as much as him, though because NO-ONE loves tractors as much as this guy). But he meets this girl who loves tractors enough to stimulate him, intellectually. 

So fast forward a couple of months and this guy brings his girlfriend to the local field to watch the tractors go by during the sunset. He proposes to her and she says yes. Then they both fall asleep in the field and he has a dream that a tractor was coming to run over him. He wakes and there is a tractor coming towards him! He quickly rolls away but his fiance gets run over and killed.

He is obviously devastated and swears never to even look at a tractor ever again. So he tears down all his posters and spends all his time in his room, alone and depressed for a few weeks until his mother, again intervenes and gets him to go to the local pub again.

When he arrives, the pub is on fire! He rushes in and takes a deep breath, sucking in all the fire and smoke.

The firemen immediately ask him how he did it. 

"I'm an ex-tractor fan." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I drove along the dark desert highway, the cool wind rustling my hair. My coffee was gone and the caffeine boost was wearing off. My eyelids grew heavy and my head lulled back. I jerked back up. I concentrated on the road until a shimmering, hazy light came into view. It was the neon lights of a hotel sign. Thank God, just what I needed

There she stood in the doorway, the pretty but stern looking receptionist. The interior was old fashioned and eerie. It made me uneasy, but I couldn't help admire the photogenic craftsmanship. Such meticulous detail, such obsessive perfection. I thought to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell".

As I grew drowsier, I decided I needed a room. We made the transaction and she took out a box of matches and a half melted candle. She struck the match and lit up the drooping candle. She led me down the quiet hallway, the candle illuminating the dimly lit corridor. As I was lead to my room in my sleepy state, I could've sworn I heard voices. They were whispering "Welcome to the Hotel California, such a lovely place. Such a lovely place."

As soon as I entered my room, I flopped onto my bed, limp with exhaustion. My head sank into my pillow and I drifted off into a deep, deep sleep. There was no dreaming that night, just dark, black unconsciousness.

I awoke hours later, covers strewn about. There was a head shaped circle of sweat on my soft, plump pillow. It was still dark. I strolled about the room, looking for my shoes. I didn't remember taking them off. I searched under the covers, only to find them tucked neatly under the dresser beside the bed.

I traveled out of the room and sauntered down the dimly lit corridor. I heard those voices again. Now that I was more alert, I could hear them more clearly. They were coming out of the other rooms, the sounded creepy. Not malevolent exactly, but more melancholy. "Plenty of room at the Hotel California. Anytime of year, you can find it here."

I got to the end of the hallway and noticed the large window overlooking a courtyard across the lobby. I looked through it and saw her, in her Mercedes Benz. She pulled into the courtyard full of her pretty, pretty 'friends'. They all started to dance. They danced through the wee hours of the morning. Some looked as though they wanted to remember, others to forget.

I went to the bar next, asked for some wine. He told me that spirit wasn't sold there since 1969. I walked again past the hallway, again hearing them whisper. "Such a lovely place. Such a lovely face".

I looked around. Neither the barman nor anyone outside seems to notice or care about the voices. I tiptoed carefully past all the rooms to see if I could hear them clearer. "They livin' it up at the Hotel California. What a nice surprise. Bring your alibis."

Thoroughly freaked out, I left the corridor filled with such haunting voices, and jogged over to a set of double white doors on the other side of the lobby and rushed through them. I stumbled into a large, empty room with a mirrored ceiling. As I looked across the room and I see her again. She said "We are all just prisoners here of our own device." She pointed to another white door across the room. It's labelled 'Master's Chambers'. I assumed it's the owner's room. 

I slowly peered into the room to find all the whispering occupants of the rooms gathered around the master's table. "Hello. I am the Nightman. Won't you join us?", he said. Next, I saw all the tortured occupants stabbing the monster with their steely knives. 

Last thing I remember I was running for the front door, eyes on the desert road, before I was stopped. "Relax" said the Nightman. "You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave."

I turned back into the hotel to find her and all the ghostly voices congregated in front of me. "Welcome to the Hotel California." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sad. I'd even go so far as to say I'm devastated. I've always gone on hunting trips to the mountains with Nate. Every summer since I was twelve. It's what I looked forward to every year. I don't have whole lot of other friends, none, if I'm being honest. That camping trip has been my only chance to socialize in the summers of recent years as Nate has acquired a more........active social life, so these annual camping trips are the only times we really hang out anymore. And now that's gone.

I'm twenty one and I have just finished college for the summer. I prepare for a hollow, lonely summer. I am just home when Nate rings.

"Hey what's up, Nate ?"
"Hey. How about we go on that trip to the mountains this Saturday ?" He sounds serious, lifeless almost.
"I thought you were too busy ?", I ask trying not to sound too pathetically hopeful.
"No. I changed my mind. I already have everything set up. I insist", he sounds pressing, like he's frustrated.

I don't want to piss Nate off right away as I don't have a whole lot of other friends to spend my summer with and this could be my only chance to see him all summer.

"Okay, sure thing", I say, slightly shaken by his out of character forwardness. "What time should we meet ?"
"Midday. Sharp. Don't be late", he replies.
"O-okay. Looking forward to it."

He hangs up. That was strange. I don't question it though, if tomorrow is the only time I can see my best friend this summer, then tomorrow it is. I'm slightly disappointed that the crux of my whole summer off will come and go within the first two days, but I decide to enjoy it while I can.
                                         ***
I wake up on Saturday buzzing with anticipation and anxiety. My bags are packed and ready to go. I stumble down the stairs and open the wardrobe. I freeze as something catches my eye. My heart turns to ice as my eyes adjust to the man standing outside my window. I slowly turn around, heart in my mouth. He's gone.

I begin to calm down as I gather my things and hesitantly head out to my car. Excitement gradually replaces fear as I drive closer to the mountain. I travel up the winding road leading deeper into the thick, green forest of the mountains and I realise I've had a goofy grin on my face the whole way up here.

I remember that Nate didn't mention exactly where we'd meet. I decide to ring but I hesitate before I press dial. I think about how he sounded yesterday; annoyed, angry, almost as if he was forced to go on this trip with me. I don't know why he'd choose to go if he didn't want to, though. Maybe he broke up with Sally. Yeah, it's probably not me. I reckon it's better to ring him than to leave him waiting so I reluctantly press that green button. It dials for what seemed like hours before he picked up.

"Yes ?", he asks in a deep, husky voice.
"Oh hey, I was just wondering where we were gonna meet ? I think you forgot to tell me yesterday." I try a chuckle in a futile attempt at livening the conversation.
"Last parking lot before the top. Head down the leftmost track. You'll see me."
"Okay tha-"
He hangs up before I could finish.
 
I reach the last parking area and start to unpack my stuff. I look around. I've never been up this far before. There's no cars or any signs indicating trails or routes. Once I lug all my gear out of the boot, I make my way towards the leftmost track.
 
This track is significantly smaller and unbeaten than the rest. I nearly missed it when I drove in. I try to think of good jokes while I make my way along the increasingly narrow pathway. If I'm going to convince Nate to hang out with me again this summer, or, at the very least cheer him up, then I can't afford to be boring or sad.

Finally a camp comes into view. I can see a fire pit as I near closer. I can see Nate's legs now. Shrubbery is blocking my view as I inch closer to the camp. My heart's racing with excited nervousness. As I draw nearer, I notice that he hasn't budged from where he was standing. Surely he would've heard me coming and at least reacted. His legs were deathly still and firmly planted in the ground. 

I pass through the bushes that were obscuring my view. My heart sinks and my feet go cold at the horrific image I witness. I feel light-headed as my brain struggles to process the sight.

"NATE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ?", I scream.

I go from sobbing to catatonic when he looks up at me. Nate was standing over the fire pit, which contained two mangled, headless bodies, which were gushing blood all over the forest floor. Nate was holding one of the the heads in his hands, after taking a bite out of the side of the face. My best friend could never have done this. As my vision ceases to blur, I come to realise that it's not my best friend. It looks identical to Nate except for the long, yellow points instead of teeth and blood stained claws for nails that are sunken into the skull of the decapitated head.

It grins at me, bits of flesh stuck in it's sharp, bone-like teeth. It's eyebrows are furrowed into a frown as it grins an evil, terrifying smile with it's yellow, huge eyes. It lets out a high pitched giggle, like nails scraping a chalkboard, as it crouches, still, in the silent, peaceful forest.

The message to run finally gets from my brain to my legs when the creature bounds towards me. I sprint, not even able to scream from sheer, pure terror. I trip over something and fall into a pile of leaves. It's Nate's phone. I grab it, realising I've dropped my own in all the panic. I manage to get back to my car without looking back and I start the engine and speed down the twisty, turny road back to civilization.

I contemplate ringing the police but, what could I say ? Something that looks like my friend killed someone ? No, I had to go to Nate's house and confront him.

An hour passes and as I pull into Nate's driveway, I find myself still shaking with shock. I barely make it up the steps to the front door of the bungalow without collapsing. I ring the bell. No answer. I ring again. And again. Somewhere around the seventh try, Nate answers the door, seemingly exasperated by such a minor task.

"Hey buddy", he says patronizingly before noticing the obviously petrified look on my face.
"What's wrong ?", he asks, alarmed, his eyes slowly widening.
"Na.....ther......dead......wo....", I begin to sob, knowing he'll never believe a word I say. "There's something in the woods !", I blurt out.
"Wha-what are you talking about ?" He takes a step back.
"There's something in the woods that looks like you. It killed a couple of hikers and it rang me on your phone."
"Wait, wait stop for a second. Some thing that looks like me rang you and killed some people. I think I left my phone in your dorm room when I met you in school last week, anyway."
"No, no. I know it sounds nuts but you have to believe me, please. It had your phone and......"
Sally comes in from the living room, looking concerned.
"What's going on here ?", she inquires.
"Oh hey Sally. This is my friend. You know, the one I've been telling you about ?", Nate says, looking at her. "This is my girlfriend, Sally."

I remain silent.

"Uh listen bud, have you ever thought about going to see a doctor or a therapist. I just think you could really benefit from it", he forces an artificially caring smile.
"Yeah my friend is a psychotherapist. She's really great and she treats all kinds of people", Sally says.

They're talking to me like I'm a child. Ever since Nate broke into his new group of friends, he likes to treat me as if there's something wrong with me and that he only remains friends with me because he feels sorry for me, but we both know he was as lonely and unpopular in school as I was. But I don't mind. If wants to use me to make himself look good in front of his new colleagues then that's fine with me. Right now, I need a friend and he's the best I have.

"Listen, Nate, just come up to the mountains with me and I'll show you."
"Look, I know you love our little trips up to the woods, but like I said, pal, I'm busy. I have a girlfriend now."
"I'm not trying to get you to go on a trip with me...... Nate, just believe me, you're the only friend I have and this concerns you too. You can bring Sally along if it makes you feel better. Please, just humour me this once and you'll see."

Nate thinks. He finally sighs.
 
"Okay. Just this once." 
"Fine, thank you. Uh, you might wanna bring a phone."

The trip up to the mountains is long and quiet. Every now and then Nate would whisper something in Sally's ear. They're probably discussing whether or not to believe me. Just a little longer, then they'll see. Occasionally, Nate would check up on me from the back seat.

"You alright up there bud ?", he'd ask, condecsending me.

Eventually, we reach the car park. It's night time now. It only adds to the eerie atmosphere. I lead them down the same I track the creature lured me down.

As we near the campsite, I can hear my heart beating louder and louder, hammering at my chest. I stop before the bushes that conceal the firepit.

"Okay. This is it", I say.

Nate is trying to act as if he finds it amusing but Sally looks as scared as I feel.

We pass through the brushes and enter the site. There's nothing but a burnt out fire pit and an old, tattered duffel bag.
I hear a muffled sigh of relief from Nate.

"No.....no", I begin to say.

Nate stands up straighter.

"Is this where you saw the bodies, bud ?", he asks, amused. I can hear the smile in his voice.

Now it's my turn to smile.

"No, but that's where they will be", I say as I take the machete out of the duffel bag.
