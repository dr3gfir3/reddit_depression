	<TEXT> I find them to have different goals and could be best utilized side by side. Buddhism I feel is best to get rid of suffering whereas Taoism is best for making life "easier" for the practitioner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm using ZUI Locker and it has pretty much all that stuff. The look and feel of it is very customizable, as well as having a daily wallpaper setting so I get to wake up every morning to a new wallpaper. It also a quick settings draw that you can pull up from the bottom where you can go to the camera or toggle wifi or the flashlight and whatnot. The only problem I've seen with it is that it sometimes doesn't open when rebooting the phone so the lock screen will be bypassed allowing access into the phone (doesn't happen all the time though). Highly recommend it though, I'm loving it and it has a lot of cool features. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I Install Cyanogenmod? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking to install Cyanogenmod on my Note 4 hoping that it will allow the phone to run a bit smoother by getting rid of bloatware and providing a more stock experience. However a main concern of mine is what will happen to two main features of touchwiz on the Note 4 that I enjoy (specifically s-pen usage and the pop up windows you can get when you hold down the back button). Would I be able to install CM but still keep those couple of features? Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simply put:
If you see a chair, one is immediately going to recognize such as a chair. However, this is just conditioning, because if you were to try to figure out what exactly that particular "chair" was, you would fail. Look up the Simile of the Chariot for a run-through regarding a chariot. We are conditioned to recognize form as being the Self of an entity, just as much as we are also conditioned to recognize mind as the Self. Understanding that this is just conditioning brings us to anatta (absence of Self). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember my public school history class taught Buddhism fairly poorly, stating how Buddhism was a monotheistic religion that believed in a single creator God.

Another class of mine taught that the book Siddhartha was an accurate depiction of Buddhism, despite the character Siddhartha realizing Brahman at the end and arriving at the conclusion that everything is relative to the observer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think of it as taking a candle, lighting a second candle with it, then blowing out the first. It seems as if the flame was transferred, but in reality the only connection between the two flames is that the second was caused by the first. Think of reincarnation like that, with the person being the flame. The flame is not a definite "thing", it is merely the product of the wick burning and releasing energy. Every moment in time the flame is different; such is the person, such is everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Read the book What the Buddha Taught, it highlights most aspects of basic Theravada Buddhism very well (I believe it also touches on Mahayana a bit). Buddhism is also something that you don't necessarily have to be open about as well, the point of it is to help yourself and to help others. If you yourself understand the Dhamma and live as such, then you will be receiving the benefits as well as others through your good deeds. I also suggest reading the Platform Sutra of Zen Buddhism, it's a different perspective on Buddhism than what is taught in the Theravada school and most Mahayana schools. </TEXT>
