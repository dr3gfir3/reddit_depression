	<TEXT> i'm presuming you know how to make simple syrup ( if not heres a guide http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Simple-Syrup ) make that but add fresh grated ginger for the heating time and add 24 hours to infuse then strain.
Make it a double measure of cello (so 50ml if your British) and half a measure oo single of syrup in a collins glass then top with soda ( these measures are entirely dependent on how sweet you like your drink) cointreau goes down nicely with a single measure in this too. </TEXT>
