	<TEXT> If Google Trends graphs are even only a slightly accurate indicator of something's popularity, Facebook has been steadily declining for a few years now, while Snapchat is the next big online network that's rising, and indeed they have a massive IPO scheduled for March. Then, a few years after that, there'll be another one, and then another one. People want an online commons for communicating and sharing stuff with other people (in parallel to real-life relationships), so there'll always be some major service, and of course in the '90s it was AOL.

I've voted solidly Democrat in every presidential, midterm, and local election since I turned 18, and now I'm voting for Trump, who has drastically re-defined the Republican platform, so he's not actually a standard Republican as we have understood the label to mean over the past 35 years, but he knew that to run as an Independent or a third party would guaranteed be a waste of time, energy, and money, as Ron Paul (who ran as a Libertarian in '88 and then as a Republican candidate in 2008 and 2012), Bernie Sanders (who switched from Independent to Democrat right before running), and Trump (who ran on the Reform Party platform in 2000 and then as a Republican this time around) himself have all indicated. This was Ron Paul's highest-profile appearance in the '88 election:

 Richard L. "Jake" Siewert, Jr. (born February 1, 1964) is head of corporate communications for Goldman Sachs. He served as White House Press Secretary during the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton and in Treasury department during the Obama Administration.

 In June 2009, Siewert joined the Obama administration in a position advising Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.[1][3]

Classic example of the revolving door!

 In politics, the "revolving door" is a movement of personnel between roles as legislators and regulators and the industries affected by the legislation and regulation.

	<TEXT> He definitely thought he was invincible. In the footage from the bar, he brags so emphatically about having done this for YEARS, in previous electionS, and he's like (paraphrasing) "I'm sure you're familiar with my work..." Saying "my work," like he's a fucking sophisticated *auteur* of anarchy just because he wears a pink shirt and shiny white tie. Anyway, an interesting thing about the videos is that the footage is spread out from different times, as indicated by his hair. He has GOT to be having some insanely paranoid nightmares about the very face of the whoever was filming him. Imagine hiring some enthusiastic person to work for you, who totally seems to be on-board with everything you do, and then they release hidden-camera footage of all the most self-incriminating things you said?!

I myself have won 2 monetary bets with a friend about this: first, my friend predicted the campaign would end after the David Duke bullshit (he was like "that's it! he's too racist too run!"), and then that it would end after the Chris Matthews question about abortion ("that's it! he just the vote of every woman!").

	<TEXT> The early 21st-century America is so fundamentally different society, political system, and culture from any year of 19th-century America, that I can't help but think that your view of things may be clouded by your study of history. The two almighty monolithic parties have been so entrenched in our society and so ingrained in the American psyche at a full 50-state national level for generations now, and perhaps the most massive difference between now and the 1800s, from 1800 all the way to 1899, is that we are totally bombarded by national media force: follow the history from newspapers to magazines to radio to television to the Internet to social media, and it's hard for the average person to even notice, let alone really see and understand just how slyly and how thoroughly the two-party duopoly, the mainstream media, and major corporations have sunk their claws into social media (See: https://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/4nip9u/astroturfing_information_megathread_xpost_rshills/). Even for those who assiduously avoid consuming any *news* media, the *entertainment* media machine has political views and attitudes and assumptions implicitly in the storylines and dialogue. 

It was acknowledged by Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012, and by Trump many times early in his current campaign, that if you run as a third party, the national two-party duopoly makes it so incredibly difficult to get press coverage (in whatever form), get included in a single debate or forum with a major candidate, and get on ballots--but the lack of press coverage is the most devastating preventative measure taken against them, as TV, [Yahoo](http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/news-websites), and Facebook (with its cleverly manipulated Twitter-like "Trending" sidebar) are where the America masses, from coast to coast, find out about anything or anyone. I wonder what actual percentage of Americans would know the name or face of Gary Johnson or Jill Stein. There have been officially self-label "Independent" candidates who were in debates, like Ross Perot, but I'm talking about anew party, not a party of one--and he withdrew in July and said it was because Republicans disrupted his daughter's wedding, then re-entered later:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1992#Ross_Perot.27s_candidacy

So, to predict a slow decline of the two-party system is, in my view, to willfully disregard just how powerful the two-party system really is. Even as the 2 main Veritas fraud videos have gotten 5M and 3M views on YouTube, and were played fully on Hannity Fox News show, there are still tens of millions of voters who would refuse, right off the bat, to even watch the videos for more than a minute, let alone at all, because of the source and how the mainstream media has been aggressively bashing O'Keefe. And CNN, the NYTimes, et al, are giving their own drastic editing, characterization, and contextualization of the videos: note how virtually every single sentence of this Times article works to undermine O'Keefe as well as Trump: http://archive.is/6oTFU. Even in my own personal life, living in Manhattan, I work with and am also even related to several well-spoken young and middle-aged adults who graduated with good grades from various universities (for whatever that may be worth), and they flat-out refused to watch the videos or take them seriously. I've been hearing these people say that Trump is a "joke," an "idiot," and a "psycho" for months and months. 

Michael Moore has been repeatedly proclaiming the demise of the Republican Party over the past 15 years, and yet, in July of this year, he published a detailed list of reasons why Trump will win: http://archive.is/7wGHO. **But I'll put this in concrete terms and let the test of time see who prevails:** ***What*** **specific actual  major third party do YOU see emerging within the next 20 or 30 years?** If not the Libertarian, Green, or Constitution Party, then who? An official Tea Party, a Socialist Party, or what? Roger Stone has said that every president has re-created the party in his image, and *that* is what I see continuing the happen. There are huge policy differences between an Eisenhower Republican, a Reagan Republican, and W. Bush Republican, but they are all "Republicans." WITHOUT the support of current elected Republican Party officials (Senators, Congresspeople, Governors, Mayors, and others), and the sea of tens of millions of Americans who proudly identify themselves as lifelong Republicans, be they day-to-day news-followers or not--with the support in the form of statements, rally turnout, and indeed financial support--Trump would have faced far too many obstacles in terms of organization, supporter mobilization, party unity and solidarity, and even just getting his message out, as you would have to infer that there would also be a Republican AND a Democrat running against him, with their own respective party officials all opposing him. This isn't some abstract theory on my part. Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian in 1988 and later bemoaned the near impossibility of getting any chance to reach out to the public (there was his now YouTube-famous appearance as a guest on the Morton Downey Jr. Show, where he was endlessly ridiculed and insulted, but responded again and again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxXwKPLZyVs). Then there was also Trump's Reform Party candidacy that went from October 1999 to February 2000; regarding party disorganization and disunity, he ultimately said, upon withdrawing: "So the Reform Party now includes a KlansmanMr. Duke, a Neo-NaziMr. Buchanan, and a CommunistMs. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2000

If Trump wins and is the next president, my bet is that Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democrat candidate, and as I see it, she's already been aggressively campaigning against him every week since he entered *this* race: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/55q99z/pocahontas_2020_if_trump_wins_i_think_the_2020/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thus, in a very ironic twist, it may end up being *Democrat* side (Establishment side) who "horrifyingly" challenge the results--and who do so, shortly after the precinct totals start being reported, since if a couple of those all-important "swing states" vote OVERWHELMINGLY for Trump, that will foreshadow a few others and then there's nothing they can do to stop the historic Trump landslide. This is just imaginative speculation, but it's still a good reason for there to be a paper trail! 

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/58g0ce/operation_stop_soros_crowd_sourced_weaponized/

Again, this is just a crazy hypothetical scenario. I mean, in the past 3 elections and now this one, there have been endless predictions about the "end" of one party or the other, and that obviously hasn't happened, just as it won't happen this time, as there are just way too many members of each of the two major parties for there to be a new party. There have been a few Independent state politicians (such as Bernie Sanders and Jesse Ventura), but there hasn't been an actual third party at even *that* level in many decades, and I don't see any new third party, whether emerging from an existing major party or not, without there already being at least 20 or 30 members of that party being elected as senators, representatives, and/or governors.

	<TEXT> As much as I can't stand Facebook as a service and a conglomerate, Zuckerberg's $2B purchase and ownership of Oculus points to it becoming much more than a gimmick. I'd say that Zynga's games were a gimmick, a fad, but Zynga happily cashed out with an IPO (see the all-time stock graph below), and didn't have to go the buyout route.

	<TEXT> Of course there need to be and will always be messaging services, and there'll probably be another big one to emerge and even be bought out in the next 5 years, but that doesn't somehow contradict that overall development within the tech industry that the study shows. And I don't see these VR companies as *following* a trending, but as *setting* or *leading* the trend, *leading* the future. Furthermore, the move over the past 30 years from phone calls to email and instant messaging, to texting, to messaging *apps*--with text-messaging alongside photo-messaging and video-messaging--and video-chatting, has been dramatic. I could see VR systems that involve video-chatting and video-conferencing. And in that way, VR will have reshaped messaging as we know it. So the next big messaging service may be a VR service.

http://catholicendtimetruths.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/APfiKi.jpg

Trump supporters don't see her as some sort of mastermind running her own campaign; she just has the most name recognition and connections and it's her "turn," regardless of her failing health. There's not a contradiction. The leaked emails show just how much other campaign workers at various levels handle everything:

	<TEXT> Social, email, and mobile technology companies and products are being gradually supplanted by Virtual Reality ones, thanks to the accelerating advances made in that field, and there are now a few products whose names are known to anyone who follows technology, and there is a concurrent steadily growing base of users. Consider Facebook's $2B acquisition of Oculus VR in March 2014, and then take a look at such subreddits as /r/oculus, /r/Vive, /r/GearVR, and of course, /r/virtualreality). This report provides the statistical support for the trends that are already very much developing, and perhaps just have only a year or two more before it hits the mainstream tipping-point. Consider just how rapidly such things as the mp3 player, smartphone, and tablet caught on after their release.

 By the 2000s, Hollywood's largest talent agencies were known as the "big five"[7] or "top five".[8] Creative Artists Agency (CAA), William Morris Agency (WMA), United Talent Agency (UTA), International Creative Management (ICM), and Endeavor. In 2009 two of the agencies, Endeavor and the William Morris Agency, merged to form William Morris Endeavor (WME).

The Access Hollywood video was supposed to seriously upend his campaign, but if you believe that polls have any accuracy, consider that in 3 of the 4 latest national polls (by Investor's Business Daily, Rasmussen Reports, and LATimes/USC), Trump is actually beating her. I personally believe that he will win.

Obviously, Katy Perry isn't individually behind that feed; it's clearly just another propaganda arm of the Clinton campaign. For much of last year, her profile picture WAS Hillarys "H" logo. 

Shes the most followed Twitter user but, curiously, if she really has 92 MILLION people following, why do most of her posts only get merely a few THOUSAND likes? The real number of active daily followers is probably several thousand. More fake numbers here in this ranking of the top 1,000 users:
