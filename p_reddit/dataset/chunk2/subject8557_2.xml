	<TITLE> TIFU by not reading the ingredients in Neosporin to see if I'm allergic. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-13 19:29:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So about three months ago I had to walk through some rain for a couple hours and then wear wet shoes all day. I had a tiny little scratch that was healing on the top of my foot and after having had wet feet all day, it became somewhat worse. So I went to my local CVS and bought some Neosporin. And, while I'm looking at the types of Neosporin, I notice the triple antibiotic neosporin and think: "Hey, this stuff has got to a little better and worth the marginally larger price," so I buy the triple antibiotic, take it home and start using it. A week goes by and it's gotten worse yet. I contribute this to the fact that it is on an area of my foot that rubs the shoe a lot, and just keep using the antibiotic every other day. A couple days later, I cut my arm and used the triple antibiotic, but this time, the entire band aid left a little rash. So now I think that the adhesive in the band aids were making my foot's sores worse and I switch to medical tape and gauze and continue using the fancy Neosporin. Then, as it continues to worsen, I realize that I'm still allergic to something and that it wasn't the band aids or any of the other factors. So, I read the ingredients on the Neosporin and sure enough, I'm allergic to 2/3 of the active ingredients in the Neosporin; the sulfate drugs. 5 seconds of critical thought could have saved me months of discomfort. So, now I've had a healing wound on my foot for months and feel like a complete idiot for assuming that triple antibiotic neosporin is just as good for me than the original stuff without thinking I might be allergic to any of the ingredients. So take a moment and read the ingredients to make sure you're not allergic to the ingredients. 


Tl;dr:Read the ingredients when buying over the counter medications, it can save you months of discomfort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Monsanto. Pick a reason, any reason. 


Edit: this is a little more controversial than I expected. The reasons i had in mind were the lawsuits against honest farmers whose crops had been pollinated by neighbors' Monsanto patented  crops. I'm not really against GM crops, but the way Monsanto covers up its products says foul play to me. Its good that they've provided more high yield crops, but they didn't have to do it by stepping on honest farmers and thumbing their nose over their prowess over the law at everybody.  </TEXT>
