	<TEXT> I would really prefer they make this a la carte, so people can add only the exact channels they want, and pay whatever added monthly fee each one costs. The online streaming/DVR component is nice, but this is just going to turn into another bloated cable package as more channels are added. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see any anti-transit comments in the article. If anything, it talks about how transit is important and doesn't need to be expensive, as evidenced by costs in Europe. It's more a criticism of the project management and bidding systems currently used in American infrastructure projects. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This actually gives a better idea for why these things cost so much here: https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2012-08-26/u-s-taxpayers-are-gouged-on-mass-transit-costs

It's not union salaries alone, otherwise European infrastructure wouldn't be way cheaper than ours, the way it currently is. These construction companies love that we blame it on worker salaries, rather than their waste. </TEXT>
