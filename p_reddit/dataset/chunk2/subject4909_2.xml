	<TEXT> I watched a bunch of shows. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Naruto, Gossip Girl, Supernatural, Nikita, One Tree Hill, Jane the Virgin, Orange is the New Black, How to Get Away With Murder, Grey's Anatomy, etc. Right now I am rotating between a couple of shows.

I don't exercise, I actually don't like to move around too much. The most I will do is go walking and I do love to dance (nothing formal). In the future I will like to take a dance class.
Anyway thanks, I love you too random internet stranger 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> @Churchly: This is going to sound ignorant but I don't believe in taking medications/drugs. I am totally down for therapy and things along that line but medications/drugs is not for me. </TEXT>
