	<TEXT> I have NEVER heard of someone doing that. The last guy I dated still has my Nintendo DS though, and a Game of Thrones inspired cookbook that he hasn't returned after about 3 months. Maybe that's his doucheface "fee" of our 3-week-long aborted fetus of a relationship. Apparently saying my ass was fat, whilst feeding me pasta and as much grease as you can imagine (I am 55kg, and pretty insecure about my body, and usually eat quite healthily), and telling me all of my opinions were wrong and that I was crazy (despite having a college education, while he had dropped out of senior year high school). He also hijacked all of my cooking. I LOVE cooking, especially breakfast. He fucked with my french toast and it was awful. He mixes the egg and milk together on a PLATE. a PLATE!!! It practically went all over the bench! It doesn't even mix properly! So we had to have a breakfast-off, until he finally admitted my cooking was better. 

He borrowed my pokemon games too. He's NO GOOD at sex or pokemon, and it was just as painful to endure either. :/ 

Whoops. That was a wall of text if ever I saw one .

TL;DR: Asshole took my DS and can't cook. Also, never tell a chick her ass is fat if you want to keep her around/are not a complete turd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Poor guy. I'd cook you breakfast, but you'd have to wait 10 minutes as oppose to 2:45... I'm not that good :p but mine includes pancakes and French toast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree. Relying on someone else for your happiness only sets you up for disappointment/heartache cause ultimately all anyone cares about is themselves. A few months back my long term boyfriend broke up with me and I thought the world was ending, I was depressed and abusing whatever substance I felt like... Until I woke up and realised that no-one is worth being miserable and wasting your life over, and decided to take control and move the fuck on (currently still single but happier than I have been in a long time).
It's an overused saying but, "Every 60 seconds you spend being sad is a minute of happiness you'll never get back". Life's too short to let people who aren't worth it bring you down :)
