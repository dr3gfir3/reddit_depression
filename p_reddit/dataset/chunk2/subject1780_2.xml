	<TEXT> At first, I debated letting him have his chance with her - protected, of course, to please my sweet, little angel. However, after a little internal struggle and some more observations, I decided that her crush needed to meet his fate in an unfortunate accident. He was flawed. It was the only way to keep the lineage strong without destroying Ursula's heart and making her resent me. Stress isn't good for the offspring.

I followed him to the back of the Diner on 27th one evening. He was attempting to smoke a cigarette - fucking poser. I was certain he saw me approaching him, but when I greeted him he jumped farther than a watermelon seed in a spitting contest. I kept the encounter brief. I asked him if he would be interested in making some cash and, as young ones are wont to do, he agreed without hesitation or asking what he had to do. *Flaw.*

My plan was simple enough. I had him come to the outskirts at midnight that Thursday. Once there, and I knew he was alone, I sicked my dogs on him. Sure, people looked for him. Probably for weeks - I don't keep up on the news. When they found his body, though, it was just shreds of decayed flesh and tattered bones - hardly identifiable. The death was blamed on wild animals. Ursula was upset, but she had no idea it was my doing.

	<TEXT> I absolutely *love* this phone. I do. It got random cracks on the back somehow (no, I didn't drop it). Even with that I just love it. I use the stylus constantly, the camera is insanely sharp, and it runs so smoothly.

However, I have a family. Keeping this and taking the risk would be one of the most selfish and ignorant things I could do. So it has to go.

I don't know what to replace it with. 

I've always avoided iPhones, even ragging on my friends that have them. But the 7 Plus seems to be the closest comparable option. The Edge doesn't really appeal to me, although I will admit I don't know much about it aside from friends who have it and letting me toy with it a bit.

What do you recommend? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it's simply implied. I haven't read them in a while, but from what I recall the rules make it pretty clear that you need to make it believable. I've also seen a good amount of stories get removed for believability issues over in /r/nosleepworkshops, so it's definitely enforced even if it is just implied.

I fully understand your point about the believability of a story falling on the author's shoulders instead of the reader. That's the entire purpose of this sub. However, readers need to not be cynical dicks and try to disprove everything. There's rules in place for that, too. It's reciprocation.

Also, some stories are actually true or mostly true. I'm still stuck in a police station in Greenville,  SC. So there's that.

	<TEXT> Micah sat back, stunned at what he had just heard come from the lips of this Robot, but before he was able to formulate a response a sharp pain radiated throughout his body and his world went black. When he awoke, Micah was sitting upright in a chair surrounded by walls full of computers and wires.

"Oh, about time ya woke up!" The Manager said as he floated his chair over to Micah. "Do ya see what I meant, son? She un'erstan's things that no Robots do. It's progress."

"Wh...what?" Micah stammered as he stood up to walk around the room and examine the area."What the hell is going on here?!"

"Highly magnetized motherboards. I wouldn't touch 'em if I were you. They don't store any mem'ry for longer than a day - so ya can't damage 'em - but hot dang will they shock the shit outta ya." The Manager chuckled. "I'll just be up front. I put ya in here. I called in the work order. I'm payin' for this...job."

Never one to lose his cool, Micah sat back down in the chair he woke up in. Not speaking nor taking his eyes off of the Manager. In his gut, he knew something was off about this old man, but he also knew that even without weapons he could end the Manager's life easily.

"I'm glad you're an easy-going fella. Don' worry - we're safe in this room."

"Safe?"

"Welp, years an' years ago, I pioneered a new tech and installed x-ray scanners into my girls' eyes. Material on this Region is ev'rythin'. Anythin' can be sold. So, I designed 'em to be able ta find stuff."

One of the walls began to whir, drawing Micah's attention. 

"Just that orb, son. Nothin' worth gettin' worked up over." The Manager stood up to stretch. "All of my girls cum. Every time. It's a fluorescent splatter that jolts inside of the patron 'n it sends a little 'lectric charge into their body. It delays the end of the transaction by somethin' I call 'Euphoric Paralysis' which gives the girls long 'nough to take what they can. No one has ever caught on."

"You're a crook, old man." Micah stood up. "I'm not taking your dirty money." He began to walk towards the only thing that resembled a door in the entire room. He placed his hand on the scanner and the wall disappeared, revealing a Robot riding on top of a slightly overweight man who was clearly out of breath. The Manager stood beside Micah and crossed his arms. "Watch."

Within a moment, the moans intensified and a bright pink liquid secreted from the Robot's vagina. The man, looking so pleased with himself, laid there looking to the ceiling as the Robot raided his pockets on the other side of the room. 

"It was an infection," the Manager said softly, "she went ta get energy packs when a Grud stuck 'er with it's tendrils. No normal doc could help 'er, and we had to rely on experimental treatments." He wiped a tear from his eye. "They were...expensive. That's how all this started, and now I'm in too deep ta just stop."

"Who?" Micah asked, beginning to feel something resembling sympathy. 

"My wife." The Manager walked away from the window. "I couldn't save 'er. I became attached to Felicia because she looked jus' like my wife did in her youth. I think that's how she became sentient."

"I'm sorry. I don't quite follow. What does this have to do with me?" Micah returned to his chair.

"Exactly what I'm payin' ya for. Felicia needs to be shut down." </TEXT>

Susan began to cry heavily. Although she was strong and prepared going into surgery, she didn't expect to feel so empty and guilty post-op.

Ashley helped get Susan into the wheelchair and took her down the hall into a small, cozy room filled with comfortable furniture and bland decor. 

"Do you need anything, Ms. Reynolds?" Ashely asked. 

"I was going to name him Peter," Susan whimpered between sobs, "Little Petey Reynolds." She stared at her stomach.

"It'll be okay, Ms. Reynolds. Just press this button if you need me." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As soon as they stepped off of the ramp, the roar of currents transcending through inaudible moans deafened them.

"This is the UltraWhore," the navigator yelled "robo-prostitution is the entire purpose of this place." He walked towards the edge of the platform and down at the dozen or so cheap, 2040s style motels below. The kind that gangsters used to churn tricks out of. The navigator reached in his jacket and placed a brown envelope in his companion's hand.

"One of them have gone sentient." He paused with a concerned look. "It wants *love*, Micah."

"Aren't these things only programmed for sex?" Micah responded.

"That's why you're here." The navigator gave Micah a nod and returned to the vessel. The UltraWhore was one of those places that everyone was aware of but no one acknowledged. Using Robots for sex became legalized by Consul Robertson about twenty years prior, under the condition that the line of software used was, under no circumstances, allowed to be programmed with A.I. capabilities. These were drones. Similar to the machines that used to manufacture automobile parts in the 2000s. Mindless husks who served one purpose: pleasure fulfillment. The fact that one of the Bots became self-aware meant a developer broke the law.

Despite all of the controversy, the UltraWhore operated smoothly. Sure, there were protests. All of those "Robot Lives Matter" groups *loved* to spend their weekends in front of the landing platform telling all of the patrons how terrible they are. It had the stigma one would expect a place like this to have. Despite it's crisp, clean appearance, at the end of the day beings were coming to this place for sex - it never sat well with society. Micah wasn't one for politics. As a sanctioned vigilante, he took jobs for the paycheck - not morals.

Micah descended into the small city, reading over the contents of the envelope on the transit ride. 

`Building 84`

`Female: Model F81-FBF6D9-0`

`Manufacturer: Vital Wires Corp.`

`Robot has gained awareness. Subject allegedly asked multiple patrons if it "is pretty enough" and has told some male patrons it loved them.`

`Payment will be received upon deactivation of unit. Additional payment may be acquired if proof of fault is provided.`

Enclosed with the briefing was a PcC with the Robot's stock photo. Young, blonde, and Caucasian with blue eyes, large bust, and slim waist- the generic model that most of the I.G. politicians preferred. It confused Micah. He couldn't fathom why such a popular model with the tenure it had would possibly have gone live. 

*"Building 84 - your stop, sir or madame."*

Micah stepped out onto the stoop of a short, long building with the number '84' partially illuminated over the doorway. As he walked up to the archaic revolving doors the smell of sweat and sex permeated the air.

"Must be the spot." He chuckled.

Micah placed his hand on the door scanner and a little floating orb appeared next to him. 

"Micah Gladstone. 36. Male. Unwed. What can we help you with?" The orb stated in a surprisingly pleasant tone.

"Er. Hello. I'm here to spend some time with F81-FBF6D9-0. I just nee-"

"Requesting Manager. Please wait." The orb interrupted. Not even a minute later, the doors lifted and an older gentleman briskly walked out, grabbing Micah's hand without hesitation. 

"Hey there, son. I hear you're lookin' to see my Felicia. This way." The Manager walked inside the building and Micah followed, slightly taken back.

"Micah, is it? My niece dated a Micah once. Pleasant boy. Son, I know you were sent to come deactivate my sweet, inn'cent Felicia but first I need you to un'erstand somethin'."

"Sir, I'm just here to do a job and collect my payment." Micah stopped walking. "I understand you have a job to do, but I also have tasks I need to complete." The Manager turned to face Micah with a homely smile and warm eyes.

"I know, son. Just listen. Then I'll take ya to see Felicia. Deal?" He stretched his hand out to Micah.

"Deal."

"Thank You. Pardon me if I bore ya. I don't often need ta come 'n talk with our patrons." The Manager began walking down a hall, signaling Micah to follow. "In these halls, Robots are sex toys - nothin' more, nothin' less. The 'lectrical currents runnin' through them pleases our patrons by the thousan's. Here, our currency is pills - ya know - the meal pills. Mostly roun' and small ones but pills nevertheless. We donate our earnings to the kids, Micah. I pride myself on keepin' money outta this. This is purely to help people feel better, be it those hungry kids or business fellas. Now, a few days -"

"Sir," Micah interrupted. 

"Now, now. We had a deal." The Manager smiled at Micah and kept talking. "A few days ago, on'a my most popular girls comes up to me 'n says she wants to feel love. Love, son. They aren't supposed to want that...and yet here we are." 

The Manager stopped in front of a dark purple door and pulled Micah under his arm.

"Like I said, I run this comp'ny to please. Felicia wants to feel love - can you at least listen to what she has to say?" The Manager pulled away and walked up to the door. "I know you have a job. I know she can be replaced...give her a shot." The Manager opened the door, upturning his palm, telling Micah to enter.

Given the passion of the Manager, Micah was expecting this Robot to be different than the usuals. Gorgeous - stunning even. Something special that would set it apart from the other, similar models.

Nothing. 

The stock photo was dead-on. A slim, blonde bombshell was sitting on a silk covered bed rubbing the spot next to it with it's hand.

"Come sit, Micah."

He obliged.

"I know why you're here. I get it - I'm not supposed to feel this way," it leaned over and whispered in Micah's ear, "but Robots need love too." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom and I went to go see my grandma in the hospital on a chilly December afternoon. I had just talked to her last night and, honestly, I couldn't contain my excitement to visit. Since she got admitted, it was the longest time in my entire life that I had gone without seeing her. As we made our way through hallways at the hospital, I began formulating a list of all the things I wanted to tell her. I brought her a handwritten copy of my Christmas list too, just in case she wanted to see it.

When we crossed the double doors into the ICU, my grandpa stopped us. He told me to go sit down by the nurse's station and he kept my mom back, talking to her for a few minutes. After a couple of confused looks and more crying by my mom, my grandpa called me over and said I could go see my grandma. With my Christmas list in hand, I went into the room ready recite my memorized speech.


I still have nightmares about what I saw when they pulled back the curtain to her room. 

My grandma was lying there in her hospital bed, tubes down her throat, and hooked to tons of machines. She was concious, though. My mom walked my up to her side and told me to go ahead and talk to her. That she could hear me but she just wouldn't be able to say anything back because she needed the tubes to help her breath. I put my Christmas list on her lap and told her I loved her and I couldn't wait til she got out. Although she couldn't say anything, she had a look in her eyes that said everything she needed to. It was happiness, mixed with just a touch of sadness and confusion. It also had that feeling that you get when you know you'll never see someone again.


That's when everything finally set in. I understood what was going on - my grandma was going to die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never outgoing and never popular, Jacob went through most of high school without a single person whom he felt comfortable calling "friend." On top of his shyness, Jacob's heritage made him the brunt of many jokes at school. "Kike" and "Half-Dick" were the most frequent, but he had heard more slurs in his three short years there than some people do in a lifetime. Jacob's mother was always hesitant about sending him to a Catholic school, but it was the highest-rated school in the state. It was just something he learned to live with.

Despite the passive teasing, most kids simply left Jacob alone to his own devices until senior year, when he landed in the same class as Chad. 

To say that Chad was your typical pretentious bully would be an understatement to the extreme. On two separate occassions he was so persistent with his bullying that the victim committed suicide. Any other student would have been persecuted, but Chad's family had almost the entire city in their pockets. 

From the moment Chad walked into study hall, Jacob knew this year was going to be his worst. "Look at this fucking half-dicked dreidal spinner." Chad said as he walked to the back of the class, standing in front of Jacob's desk. "You're done here, Jew."

Chad didn't let up for the entire duration of senior year. It started with aggressive name calling and random beatings in empty hallways. Then, it progressed to broken windows and damaged property. Jacob's parents called the police so many times that the station could have written a chapbook with the transcripts, but nothing ever came of it. "No evidence" is what they were told.

The bullying peaked when Chad began following Jacob home from school. Up until that point, Jacob took solace in the fact that at 3pm he was away from the pain for another day. He craved that last bell...and now it didn't matter. Chad knew every street. Every turn. There wasn't anywhere Jacob could easily walk to that would lead him back home. He began studying maps of the area, hoping to find *something* to get him away from Chad and home as fast as possible. It wasn't until he started studying older maps that Jacob realized where he could go: the junkyard.

That was it! Well, assuming it was still there. It was 1998 and the map he found the junkyard on was from 1986. Filled with eagerness, Jacob almost sprinted on his way home the next day with thoughts of finally having some peace again. When his legs got him to his destination, Jacob understood why the place was no longer on the map. It was solid walls of scrap and other materials. Rusted wire fencing loomed overhead, topped off with barbed wire and a sign that warned against trespassing with a strange symbol. 

"Safety," Jacob thought. Before he had a chance to find a bell or a way to be let inside, Chad yelled from the distance. 

"Found ya, Ashes. Stop moving"

In a perfect blend of desperation and desire, Jacob forced himself into the yard between a couple of rolling metal gates. The junkyard was a maze of car parts and appliances from all eras of modern times. Jacob, however, had no time to admire the historic aspects of the yard - Chad was more than halfway through the same opening Jacob came in. Jacob took off running as fast as his legs could muster. After a seemingly endless amount of twists and turns, Jacob ran into his downfall - a dead end. 

Without knowing it, Chad had been on his tail the entire time and had Jacob cornered. 

"You're dead, Jewbo-"

Before Chad had time to finish his insult, the walls surrounding the boys began rumbling and decades of debris began falling all around them. Amidst the chaos, some of the junk began to pull together, forming a gargantuan body not too far off from a human. Stunned, neither boy ran nor spoke.

The creature stood in front of them, now with rusted bolts for eyes and washer hoses for hair. As Jacob attempted to understand what was in front of him, Chad threw a large paint can at the head of the beast. It erupted with white paint, revealing the word "emet" across it's forehead.

"Golem..." Jacob said under his breath.

"Wh..what?!" Chad yelled back, as the golem wrapped it's dilapidated steel hands around him. "Help!" There was no helping him. The golem lifted Chad up and gave him such a hard squeeze that blood exploded from him just as the paint can had done. 

Jacob ran. 

The thunderous footsteps grew louder as Jacob attempted to navigate the maze along the same path he took in. Left. Left. Right. Left. Without realizing the golem had stopped chasing him, Jacob plowed through the gates and didn't stop until he was safe at home. 

Chad was given a grandiose funeral, and the city honored him as a hero. The story was that he was crushed under falling debris whilst trying to save the old junkyard dog. Whether or not people believed that story is debatable. However, only one thing mattered to Jacob. 

He was never bullied again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how long I've been here. Maybe four, five days tops? Although it feels like an eternity, logically I know it couldn't have been *too* long.

I fell asleep in my apartment in upper Manhattan and woke up in this old, rustic cabin in the middle of an endless field of sunflowers. There's an older woman, maybe fifty or sixty, here with me. She seems to be a caretaker, of sorts. Every day at 8am, 1pm, and 6pm there's a full table of food put out. She's constantly cleaning and doing other chores as well. The newspaper clippings I've found lead me to believe her name is Lois, however, she doesn't answer me when I talk to her so I've been unable to ask. Come to think of it, she doesn't even acknowledge my presence. 

Initially, I tried to get back home...but the fields just don't end. Green stalks with gold tops that stretch closer to the heavens that I ever could hope to. There was one time I think I came close. Just once. I had been walking for an hour or two when I noticed the sunflowers were beginning to wilt. They began hanging lower and lower until they all became grayscale in color. Even the ground and sky seemed to fall in line with the new scheme. Going further, I saw a clearing not too far off in the distance - and that's when she showed up.

"Thomas." She said, crisp and clear.

Everything went white and I woke up in the same bed. That was the closest I've come to the end. The other times I've..fallen. I pass my body every time I try to leave again. They keep a nice trail of my progress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was walking, drunk. It was 11:30 pm, and I had to get home to get ready for work the next day.

I've never liked the idea of driving drunk.

It was a rather chilly night for fall and, of course, I hadn't properly dressed for the weather. 

Maybe that's why the white truck pulled up next to me and asked me if I needed a ride. I told him no, but he insisted.

I obliged.

"Where to?" He asked, revealing the whiskey on his breath.

"I'm about four blocks down the road, on the corner." I lied.

When we pulled up to "my" house, he locked the doors.

"I know you, don't I? Mike's brother." He said as he shifted his left hand down towards the bottom of the door.

Instincts took over and I didn't wait around to answer him. I slammed on the door as hard as I could and ran into the backyard of the house as soon as the door swung open.

I heard him cursing under his breath and his footsteps coming closer. Then, as if by pure luck, he turned and walked away. 

I stayed there, calling everyone I knew would be awake but had no success. 

I ran home. 

I always take a taxi now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks great on mobile! My only comment is on the stories tab vs. read stories tab. I don't fully understand the purpose of that. Still, I love it! </TEXT>
