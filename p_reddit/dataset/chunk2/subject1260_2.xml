Planning on eatin 1800 calories a day and cardio (treadmill, cycles and rowing) at the gym a minimum of 3 days a week for about an hour and half for all those that need that info. My job makes it very unlikley that I can go to the gym or exercise more than that though. </TEXT>

In your head you just think it's going to go on forever, when I watched Fish Scroll last week I had no idea. No one did. Jake and Amir have been massive inspirations in my comedic career, being two comedians who helped me pick the mic up in the first place. Their web series was just the start of my love for them. Without this web series where would I be? No idea. I suffered from depression for a good many years and through therapy and medication ,Jake and Amir kept me sane every week without fail. Kept me smiling. 

However this feeling is bittersweet and am so happy you two are willing to branch out with your careers. I know we all wish you the best of luck.

You two are heroes. I frickin mean it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (Jake is sitting at his desk, working on his laptop. For a second he stops as Amir approaches with a swagger in his step and a song in his heart carrying a Cookie Monster Plush Toy)

Amir: They see me rolling, they hating, all because Im riding Bernie (As he says Bernie he points at Cookie Monster. Amir then stands there with his mouth open and a huge grin on his face as he waits for Jake to comment)

Jake: (Looking defeated) You know how most people have at least one redeeming quality? (Amir nods his head loosely) Well you dont. Okay, you just dont. You took a beloved childhood character say that youre riding it and then dont even have the common decency to get that characters name right? Just stop. Youre bad.

(Amir sighs loudly, looks defeated, takes his seat and brings his laptop out sitting Cookie monster to the side of it so it looks at Jake)
Jake: Really? That was it? All I had to say was that to get you to start working? By the way I have told you these things numerous times. Id say at least once a week for the past 7 years.
(While Jake has been talking Amir has been typing)

Amir: I just sent something to the printer could you go get it for me? I have no shoes on.
Jake: (Taken aback) Weird reason why you cant go to the printer, youre inside. But okay because its the first normal thing youd asked of me since Ive met you.
(As Jake walks away Amir stares at him with his eyes narrowed. Jake arrives at the printer and is horrified to see that out of the paper tray an already rolled up and wax stamped scroll has come out. Jake looks back at Amir)

Jake: How?! How do you print out a scroll? Let alone have it rolled up and stamped for you?

(Amir puts his hand out to Jake)

Amir: The scroll please, you troll.
Jake: No! Not if youre going to call me a troll! Youre the tro-

(Suddenly Jake doesnt have the scroll and it is in Amirs hands)

Amir: (proudly declaring) Top 10 sneakers to wear by Amir Jakery Blumenfieldwhizz

(Jake takes his seat back at his desk and looks on at Amir, surrendering himself to what is about to happen)

Amir: Number 10, I know a lizard named Glen. He came frown the sewer and I did know fewer-

Jake: (Interrupting) Fewer? Fewer what? Fewer lizards? Also you sound like you know a lot about this lizard. Why are you friends with it?
Amir: (Continuing) But then Glen become a bit too big for his boots so I shot him with a moose. (Amir chuckles to himself)

Jake: So when you said fewer you did mean fewer lizards which is just a weird thing to say. What do you mean too big for his boots? You tell me these stories with nothing to base it upon. No backstory no nothing and how do you shoot someone with a moose?

Amir: (Continuing still chuckling) and then I wore him on my caboose! (As he says this he puts his feet on the desk showing his bare feet)

Jake: You mean feet! And no youre not. There is nothing on your caboose. Cmon buddy. You havent made this little sense in ages.

Amir: Number 9. Oh. What. Is. The. Time?

Jake: Stop pausing in between words. This doesnt have to take as long as you think it should.
Amir: (excitedly) I say its time for crime! I got me and my cowboys together for a rodeo where we got some whores and bought some (waiting for a response but doesnt wait long enough) blow!

Jake: (Mouth ajar and hands in the air) I dont get it. I dont know what to do. You got your cowboys together? What? Do you ever self examine? Do you ever think about what youre going to say? And if this is all true then you live a deprived sad little life. Bud, I want to feel sorry for you but I cant.
Amir: Let me answer your question with a question Jakey. What do you think Number 8 is? Yeah thats right dont be late! Put your Air Jordans on and get some Pear Gordons, Ron! We got a plane to catch let me just fix up this sweater patch. (Pulls out a sweater with a patch on it)

Jake: Why? Why have you got that? To make that rhyme? And well done it took you two attempts to even put a brand of shoe on your Top 10 Sneakers to wear list.

Amir: Number 5
Jake: Wrong

Amir: Sneakers to jive. Chocolate covered and full of peanuts thats what we get when we wipe our butts. (He says this as he puts his hand up his asscrack and brings out a lump of his own shit)

Jake: (looking like he will be sick) Oh my god! Why? Why have you just pulled out shit from your asshole? In the office? Thats not okay! Thats not fine!

(Amir is giving the shit to Cookie Monster as he tries to put it in his hand)

Amir: Well then

Jake: No! Not well then! Wash your hands!

Amir: Number 2

Jake: Wrong Number! Wash your hands!

Amir: The Cookie has poo.

Jake: (Shaking his head) How dare you! How dare you actually look like youre doing work and then do a full 180! Not even a 180! A 270! You planned all of it! You planned actually looking like you did work and then planned to pull shit out of your ass! What the fuck is wrong with you?

Amir: And the cookie becomes then a poo shoe. 
(A long pause occurs)

Amir: Number 1. Fun in the sun. A vacation is what the doctor ordered.

(Amir rolls back up the scroll)

Jake: What the fuck man? What did I just hear? On your top 10 list of sneakers to wear list you only had 6 entries. With a lot of effort gone into the first 3 and no effort in the last 3. In fact Im pretty sure you copied youre Number 1 from a previous scroll and you havent even commented on the shit thing.
Amir: (Stares with his hands together looking at Jake and appearing to take in his every word) Youre a poet Jake. A god damn 55% poet. (Amir goes back to typing) Could you get something from the printer for me?

(Jake accepts as he cant see it getting any worse, a piece of paper with the words C is for Cookie and cookies are for shit on it. Then runny shit spurts from out the printer. Closing the episode)

	<TITLE> Just completed all of MK 8's Grand Prix's. Overall I am feeling a bit disappointed by the game. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-27 12:54:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I got a Wii U this game was on the top of my list. In fact I went out and got the game the very same day. Mario Kart 8 topping many "Best game of 2014 lists" and being advertised as that on the Nintendo eShop. It was fair to say that expectations were high I love all of the other Mario Karts and this one should be the best one yet. Right? I'm sorry to say that I found the game just a tad on the disappointing side.

For me the tracks were just not as good as the other games tracks, I say this because I can't really remember them. I could tell you my favourite tracks in MK Wii or DS but with 8 I just cant remember any of them. For lack of a better example I felt that in this game, the game that introduces anti gravity in the series they could have done an amazing Rainbow Road. But alas it wasn't as spectacular as the other ones. In fact I prefer playing the Retro Rainbow Road in this game than the new one.

I'm also not completely down to clown with the whole anti grav thing, it's fun the first time you do it but sometimes I just feel it's a bit too gimmicky and would have preferred some "normal flat tracks".

However it's not all doom and gloom, the production value is amazing and a fully HD Mario Kart was always going to be a joy to look at. Also having alot of fun with the online mode!

Does anyone else not get the hype behind this game? Or am I alone?

Edit: Also the character roster is a complete and utter joke. 4 Baby characters?! Pink Gold Peach? What?!

TL;DR : MK8 dissapointed me, it feel gimmicky in places and unmemorable. Does anyone else feel that way? Or is the genrael opinion that it's amazing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello all just stumbled into this sub here and thought I'd ask a question. I love Lego. As a product it's fantastic and I spent many hours of my childhood building. To be honest I'd like to get that back, my only problem is money. To be honest again alot of the Lego sets I have seen are very *very* expensive and can't justify to my parents (I still live at home) spending that much money on a "childrens toy". 

How can I justify my new found hobby when approached? And what sets etc should I start out with? 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello folks. I hope you have had a good Christmas holiday. First this is a confession. I have confessed to those I am accountable with, however I love this community so thought it would be best confessing here to. So for a few months I have been hitting it off with this girl. She's great, I'm attracted to her and her theology is on point. We have alot in common and she often comes to me for advice etc. Last month I told her I liked her and she said she would pray about it as she wanted this to line up with God's will. Great! Sounds like my kind of girl. However it's been over a month now and we havent bought it up once. She texts me every morning without fail and we talk every day to. We meet one and one and just talk about Jesus but never what our relationship is. Recently I have seen her like her exes pictures on Instagram and Facebook. He's a Christian to so whenever he posts a bible verse she likes it and vice versa. They seem to talk on Twitter and over comments on Facebook. This has turned me into someone quite obsessive. On the Facebook app you can see when someone was last online and I keep checking to see when they're both online and when they are instantly get jealous. I check their Twitters and other social networking to. As I've been at home all Christmas my days have been spent like this. I have no evidence that they like each other in anyway other than comments and Tweets I've seen and from what I can gather she does like me and if she doesnt then I feel shes been leading me on. I need peace in this situation as I'm having sleepless nights thinking about it.

Thank you all!

TL;DR - I like a girl and when I see her ex like her Social Media posts and vice versa I get angry. This has led me to stalk both their online lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Didn't know how to describe this in the title. Basically I have liked this girl for 5 years and the other month I told her I liked her. She giggled and said she didn't know how she felt she'd give it time. Since then she pretty much gets me everyday. However because of my anxiety I think she may like another guy because she likes his Instagram and Facebook posts quite regularly. 

I know this is all a bit silly and I'm probably over reacting but what do I do? This is making me lose sleep.

Thanks for understanding. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dont get me wrong I love Game Grumps and I love content but I personally think we're a bit spoilt really. I cannot think of another channel that posts 3 episodes a day. That's insane. No wonder half of you think Game Grumps is declining in quality.

The practical reason for this thought is that I really want to watch through the Sunshine series again while keeping up to date with the Sonic Boom, Katamari and DKC episodes. Man it's a lot of time to spend watching games each day.

Maybe Monday, Wednesday and Friday could be video days and prehaps a One Off or VS on Sat and Sunday. I think if these was adopted people wouldnt complain about lack of quality in the show and we would have more days to catch up.

Just a thought. </TEXT>

I'm going to playing the game single player, first and have matches with my friends of course. But as I want to start a new hobby I thought I'd go and do For Glory matches alot and possibly get competitive. This is a man who played Brawl as his first Smash game and loved it but never played competitively.

What do I need to know?

Edit: I mained DK in Brawl and will most certainly main him here to. </TEXT>

Also just the blatant fact that Arin doesnt know where he's going anymore. In some regards thats the games fault but I have it and it's not as bad as they make out. </TEXT>

Edit: with the old cable it DID work once but the cable died in my care (it was battered) so there is hope.
Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello all. My dad (60) recently got a tablet for his birthday and as doing so also signed up for Facebook. I helped him sign up at that time there was no phone numbers in the house that could be verified with his account so we skipped that part. Due to privacy settings Facebook signs you out of the app every month or so, however my dad cannot get back into the app without ID. The app is asking for a picture of at least two forms of ID. He no longer has his birth certificate, he doesnt drive and has never been abroad. I come here asking for help, is there a way to revert back to using a mobile number as ID? It's not giving us the option. Or is there a way to contact Facebook and discuss the problem?

Thank you! </TEXT>

I want a relationship but my job right now doesnt give me time to actually see people. I understand that seeing and interacting with someone is a MASSIVE part of a relationship but even if we were going to I just wouldnt get time to. 

I know ads like this stink of trolls and etc but please none of that.

	<TEXT> This is an update from this:https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/2n90bn/brought_a_nintendo_64_in_a_drunkdepressed_state/

So my Nintendo 64 came and I was naturally very excited. I set it up and hooked everything up but I cannot find the blasted thing on my TV. I have two options and that is either to plug the AV Composite cables into the TV itself or put them into a SCART head and do it that way. However I have tried both and the problem persists. I have dug abit online and it does seem like a common problem without a common fix. Some people have had to buy upscalers etc, I'd rather not do that because of being tight with money at the moment. To try and be as helpful as possible my TV is a Toshiba 40BL702B. Anyway thanks in advance for any help! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So recently I have seen posts about "Grumpcade" and what it actually is. I have a few questions regarding what the show is/ confirmed to be?

1.I heard that in the same vein as Steam Train being any combo of Grumps playing PC Games that Grumpcade will be any combo playing console games. Is this true? If so then what will be the point in Game Grumps?

2. I also heard it would be for 4 player console games. Again isn't this what Steam Rolled is?

If anyone can explain what Grumpcade is meant to be I will be grateful!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This post is just another thank you to the Grumps. With all the negativity in this sub I thought this would be a welcome change. Here's my story.

This week I have been basically diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety, this is fine every other day of the week because I have work and it takes my mind off it. However on Sundays I don't do anything from 1 in the afternoon and my mind starts to wander and get sad. However yesterday I decided to go on a "Grumps Spree" and dear me. Did it cheer me up and to end my day the new parts of DKC and Sonic Boom.

I'm aware the Grumps cannot cure my problems and I am not relying on them to do that as after all they are just a web show. But for a few hours at least I can be depressed with a smile. </TEXT>

Prayer over this would be massively appreciated. Please PM me if you have any questions or anything to say.

	<TEXT> I'm not here for advice on which phone to get, I have decided to get the iPhone 5c because at the moment it has the best deal for me. What I want to do with it is phone, text, use Facebook, Twitter, Install a few low graphically demanding games, a few news apps, email and search the web. I have heard reports of the phone not lasting the two years I will have it on contract for, so other than the advice "Get a better phone" how can I maintain my phone and apps so that in 2 years I can say goodbye to it not dissapointed.

Thank you all.

*Edit for clarity*: I have never had an iPhone before and my last phone was a Blackberry the one before that was a Nokia Lumina.

TL:DR - Getting a 5c for low maintenance use how is the best way I can use it so that I am happy for the next two years? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-10-28 12:15:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all, Recently I felt God has been trying to help me break away from my porn and masturbation addiction. 

**A little background information about my struggle**

I've been chronically masturbating for about 5 years, everyday, many times a day. I've tried on and off to stop doing it to no avail. I realised recently I can't keep going on like this. It's rewiring my mind, taking up time and recently has eaten up finances. I know about the sub r/nofap and r/nofapchristians and if that is the community you need right now I highly recommend them.

For me personally being in a community talking about masturbation made me feel guilty and not convicted by the spirit. I need to stop though and I know it. I need the wider church to pray for me because I just cannot do this anymore. I dont have the willpower or strength to do it because in the moment it's enjoyable. I want that to change. For Christ.

TL;DR I masturbate alot. Pray for me to stop. </TEXT>
