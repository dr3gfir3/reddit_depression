	<TEXT> people jump on any bandwagon weather it be team related, player bashing, or player cock sucking. you'll see people post things in one thread, and then the exact same people turn around and contradict themselves in the next thread because it's "what everybody else is saying."

r/nba is no different from the other sports subs on Reddit in those regards (in my opinion). Not that I consider anything you wrote to be incorrect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love how Bernie is out there fighting for us and Hillary has dropped off the face of the planet.

edit: You guys are the left's version of trump supporters. Please just stop with crap like this sub, you make liberals look fucking ridiculous. There is a reason that well over 50% of the country, not limited to just dems and repubs hate her. 

edit: Since I seem unable to respond to people (dont know if I am banned or what the deal is) I will write what I tried to respond to someone with:

You'd think if she actually cared like she tried to tell people she did, despite it not being her job any more, she would be doing *something, anything*, to fight Trump. But she isn't. 

Whenever I say this, the only response I *EVER* get, is "and if she was here you would be telling her to go away".

Is that the case with some Bernie supporters? Yes, I am sure it is. Is it the case with all of them? No, obviously not, because it isn't how I feel. 

May I ask you, as a strong Hillary supporter, you really prefer her doing nothing right now?


edit: Plenty of people replying and messaging me nasty things, yet no one answers the question I asked in my previous edit....funny. Exactly like Trump supporters.

	<TEXT> In my opinion, I dont think that is really true. Its not like they are on the phone with each other every week trying to get a trade worked out. This was something they discussed earlier on but it fell through when it was revealed how much Chicago was asking for. 

If they are talking again, it means something has changed on one side, and its not the Celtics.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My take on this is that the Bulls *know* what Danny has said it would take to make the trade happen. 

The fact that Danny is quite obviously NOT desperate to make one, makes me believe Chicaco has come to him and is willing to reduce their asking price. 

My prediction is, if this report is true, he is going to be a Celtic. 

Of course these things are often bullshit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you explain that he had more production in St Louis than in New England then? And Im not saying this as a sleight to him, he has had injury problems which has kept BB to use him on a limited basis. But BB will tell you how much he loves Danny. He calls him a "football player", like the best compliment BB can give. 

Also, he has been our most clutch receiver in the playoffs the last 3 years. 

You opinion makes sense from an outside perspective to an extent though. </TEXT>
