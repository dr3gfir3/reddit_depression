	<TEXT> I was just passing through the LaSalle blue line entrance. A young couple had two young kids and were passing through the gate with their strollers. The CTA woman working the booth gave her small bag of Cheetos to the younger of the two little kids for them to share, and the look on the kids face made it seem like he just saw Santa. So excited over a bag of Cheetos. 

It's the small things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted this in MLS but I figured some here would enjoy reading it as well. 

Chicago Fire has had a horrible problem with people using the puto chant. A few games ago, Section 8 fans and other Fire fans were actually getting into fights over using the chant. It's been getting out of hand. It's embarrassing, hurtful, and does not align with our desire to include everyone.

While the argument can be made that it's tradition for some, most of us Fire fans personally believe it has no place in MLS. Management finally made an announcement about the chant and threatening to eject fans that use it due to the nature of the chant. 

The announcement is overdue, but it's very appreciated by the fans, especially on Pride Night.

	<TEXT> Most people probably know that, in the last couple years, Chicago Fire has had a horrible problem with people using the puto chant. A few games ago, Section 8 fans and other Fire fans were actually getting into fights over using the chant. It's been getting out of hand. It's embarrassing, hurtful, and does not align with our desire to include everyone.

Throughout the primaries, time and time again, we exposed the DNC for their corruption, only to be told we were "crazy conspiracy theorists". Yet here we are, days before the convention, and the truth has finally been brought to life with evidence. 

Do not sit quietly while certain media outlets refuse to report this. Every single one of us should be outraged. Take your voices off of Reddit and let them be heard. Email your local journalists, news reporters, etc. Reach out to international news outlets. Do not sit silently. We let our voices be heard during Bernie's campaign. Continue to be heard. Keep fighting what we've been fighting since the beginning.

We can be the change in the political landscape. I am still with Bernie. </TEXT>

Edit: I just asked the mods why it was removed when they said it would not be and only when it hit the front page. No response yet. 

Response: "Yes sorry about that. It was discussed and even though the revelations may be important until it actually effects Bernie or the campaign it is off-topic. Better suited for a Hillary related sub or general politics. Sorry!" 

Very confused how a document that's released that proves what Bernie has been saying about the DNC and Hillary all election is off-topic.

	<TEXT> Bernie has criss-crossed California this past month holding an absolutely astounding34 rallies, and he has the sunburns to prove it. He is going all in to win CA, and he needs our help. 

Text4Bernie is taking a YUGE challenge - contacting 1 million voters in CA by Tuesday. First and foremost, we want to make sure people know to get out and vote. We also want them to know where to find their polling locations and what to do if there's a problem. 

In the last few days, I've talked with hundreds of CA voters; ALMOST ALL of them are voting for Bernie. Some need help finding their polling place or just have general questions. CA is feeling the Bern.

Please consider starting Text4Bernie this weekend. In 1 shift you can reach a couple hundred people, and you can reach over 1,000 people a day. 

It's a self-starting process - go to textforbernie.com to get started. We have a great support network to help you through every step. 

We've come this far because of passionate people like you. Let's take this to the convention and beyond. </TEXT>

* Canvass. If you're lucky enough to be in or around a state voting on Tuesday and you'd like to go door-to-door, find a group to canvass with! Lots of people find this one of the most exciting ways to connect with other Bernie supporters. Find a canvassing event in your area at Bernie.to/map. 

* Donate. If you aren't interested in volunteering in the ways above, you have the option to donate. Make sure to use the link in the sidebar! Please remember to only donate if you live in the US. 

As always, thank you for helping us come this far. We have become so much more than just a political campaign. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm wondering if I can do anything about the creep on the blue line this morning

Edit: I took a picture of the guy as he was walking off the train so I know what he was wearing and I have a good visual of his face. I'll probably go in and try to file a report, so at least they have this on record if this fucking creep continues doing this sort of thing. He almost gave himself whiplash trying to check out two 15 year old girls walking past him, so I'm sure this isn't the first time this has happened.

Double edit: Got in touch with the Forest Park police dept. since this was at the Harlem stop. The officer heavily encouraged me to come in and file a report after I get off work so they can pull surveillance, get a report going, and see if any other complaints have been made. He was incredibly helpful and genuinely nice. Thanks for your replies and advice!  

Last edit: Just left the police station and made a report. Cops couldn't have been nicer. Don't know if it would have been the same if it was CPD, but I'd still encourage anyone to encounter something like this to report it to police. FPPD told me to straight call 911 next time I encounter something like this, so I'll pass that on to you all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can make a YUGE difference. If you want to volunteer to help us out and get Bernie elected, now is the time. We're in the homestretch and there is no better time to get involved than RIGHT NOW. Californians LOVE Bernie, we just need to make sure they know their options for voting. You can: 

* Phonebank 
* Facebank
* Text4Bernie
* Canvass
* Donate 

NPP voters that want to vote by mail have until 5/31 to request a Democratic ballot.

	<TITLE> If you've got a smartphone and a little bit of free time, you can reach up to 1,000 potential Bernie supporters a day. It's incredibly effective, super easy, requires no calling, and you don't even have to wear pants to do it. Here's how. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [TextForBernie](https://www.textforbernie.com) has easily become one of the most effective ways to reach a large amount of people in a short amount of time. Here's how it works:

Do a short training and introduction. Get acquainted with the system, the lines of communication, etc. One of the best things about TextForBernie is the amazing support system from other volunteers. 

Download the app. The app allows you to easily contact the pre-loaded voter base and protects your personal information. 

Sign up for a shift. Each shift will have a different message you're sending. Everything is pre-loaded, you just have to press send. These messages are to encourage people to attend events happening near them. 

Send messages! You'll get lots of responses, either from people asking for more information, asking how else they can help, and the occasional person who asks to opt out of communications. 

So what is so great about this? California has become a priority for the campaign. Californians are jumping at any opportunity to volunteer and are incredibly receptive to messages from TextForBernie. The more that we can get Californians involved, the larger chance we have come June. Of course, there are other primaries coming up and there will be shifts focusing on those primaries as well. 


If you don't like phonebanking, you've run out of Facebanking options, live too far for canvassing, and donating isn't your thing, TextForBernie is an amazing option. I highly encourage </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The last two days I've been texting California through [Text4Bernie](www.textforbernie.com) about volunteer opportunities. Out of the hundreds of messages I've sent, I got 2 no's because they support another candidate. Only 2. 

There are older folk (65+) who are jumping to go to a phonebank event. There are college students who want to phonebank in their dorms while they take breaks from studying. There are people who want to bring their friends to rallies and show them what amazing support Bernie has. 

These are actual responses I've gotten from people. Those who can't make the event I'm texting them about are asking for other events in their area. People are offering rides to these events for other Bernie supporters. The Bern in California is unreal right now. 

It's so crucial that we get as many people in California as involved as possible. While you're phonebanking, Facebanking, canvassing, or texting, remember to ask if they're interested in volunteering. Most of the time they WILL say yes. You just have to let them know how. 

We can win California. I know we can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the last year, more Americans are waking up to the reality of our current political system. We **can** be part of the change that desperately needs to happen. Bernie is our frontman, but he needs our support now, in the final stretch, more than ever. 

Text4Bernie is now back up and running. It's incredibly easy to use, quick, and effective. Get started at textforbernie.com. We have a great support network to help with any questions you may have while volunteering. There are loads of open positions for shifts this week! This is great if you can't Facebank, Phonebank, or donate. 

If you can donate, please consider also donating to Tim Canova. Tim is facing Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her congressional seat. Let's face it, the DNC needs a makeover. This is a great start. 

Thank you to everyone who has helped the campaign get this far. Every dollar, call, text, canvassing conversation, Facebank.and vote has made a difference. You are now part of a much larger movement. You should be proud of yourselves for helping Bernie get this far. Let's keep pushing. 

To the convention, AND BEYOND!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If phonebanking isn't your thing, you've exhausted Facebanking, and you're not in the area to canvass, what can you do?

TEXT FOR BERNIE.

I can't believe how incredibly simple it is. I sent 180+ messages in a few minutes and started getting replies almost instantly. It's handled through Hustle so your personal phone number is never given out, and the number you're sending from is a number local to where you're texting. There are volunteers on various slack channels to support you, laugh with you, and cry with you. People will respond to you with questions, comments, (a complaint here or there), so it's similar to phonebanking BUT it's great because you have more than a few seconds to respond. 

I watched the introductory webinar, went through the steps, and signed up for my first shift within an hour. Right now, I'm talking to voters on the west coast. I signed up for a shift tomorrow after work as well. 

This isn't a post to shame anyone into volunteering. This is simply to show how easy it is. If you're uncomfortable phonebanking, Facebanking is no longer an option, or you can't canvas, this is a very easy way to get involved if you want.

**Facts to help as talking points for IN** 

**Veterans**

* As of 2014, there were 476,283 veterans living in IN. 

* Across the US, on any given night last year, nearly 58,000 veterans were homeless. During 2012  the most recent data  about 140,000 spent at least a night at a shelter or in a housing program.

**Unemployment and Trade Agreements**

* Employees of the Carrier manufacturing plant in Indianapolis were recently told they will be laid off when their jobs are moved to Mexico. Additionally, their sister company will be moving to Mexico, taking a total of 2,100 jobs. This company made 7 billion in profit in 2015 - the CEO is paid over 14 million. 

* Since 2001, the USA has lost over 60,000 factories. Trade agreements are not helping keep jobs in America. 

* Since NAFTA, Hoosiers have lost 113,000 manufacturing jobs. 

* Bernie has opposed EVERY trade agreement that has lead to these effects. HRC has supported almost every trade agreement. 

**Living Wages**

* Minimum wage in IN is $7.25/hr - not a livable wage. Minimum wage should be raised to $15/hr. 

**Childhood Poverty**

* Over 330,000 kids are living in poverty in IN. That's over 21% of the children living in the state. 

* The childhood poverty rate in Indianapolis is over 30%. 

* 16,000 public school kids in IN were homeless during the 2012-2013 school year. 

**Young Generations**

* Young generations now have a larger chance of having a lower standard of living than their parents. To some, the American Dream is dead. Bernie wants to expand the middle class of the country and keep the American Dream alive. 

* We live in a competitive global economy. It's important that Americans receive the education they need WITHOUT graduating in thousands of dollars of debt. Americans should not be punished for receiving an education. 

**Drug Reform**

* Reform our drug policies. De-criminalize marijuana and end the war on drugs. 

* Substance abuse and drug abuse are not criminal issues, they're health issues. 

**Native American Rights**

* 18,462 Hoosiers reported Native American as their only race

	<TEXT> Last night was rough. We won RI, we were close in CT, and the other 3 states were lower than we had hoped. No one ever said this was going to be easy. Our campagin doesn't have money pouring in from millionaires wanting to protect their special interests. Our campaign relies on people like **us** to continue our passion. Here's what we have immediately coming up ahead. 

**May 3rd - Indiana OPEN Primary (83 delegates)**

If you will be 18 by November 8, 2016, you can vote in the primaries! 

[If you'll be voting, check your registration and polling info here](http://m.indianavoters.com/)

**SANDERS45%**


This is a winnable state. We are close. If you're interested in volunteering, there are quite a few options: 

**In the area? Face-to-face conversations are your thing?**

 Two Bernie canvassing events are happening this weekend. These links also contain information regarding carpooling.
Saturday, April 30th - https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/gpgfmp
Sunday, May 1st - https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/gpgfzm

Interested in showing support? [Bernie is speaking in West Lafayette, IN](https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/rally/gpg34k) and [in Bloomington, IN at IU](https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/rally/gpg347). The West Lafayette event is out of tickets, but you can ask around to see what kind of overflow there may be showing support outside. 

**Outside of the area?**

We know how crucial phonebanking has been to our campagin. It's fun, easy, and effective. 

[Texts for Bernie] (https://www.textforbernie.com/) is a great tool to use. Not only does it serve as a reminder for the primary, it allows people to ask questions they may have about voting locations, hours, etc. 

Facebanking is great for those in IN and outside (depending on how large your social network is!). It's incredibly easy to use and takes a couple minutes. 

Donating - anything and everything donated is important. 

**What else can we do?**

There's a Facebook page called Hoosiers for Bernie Sanders (about 6k likes) that provides up to date and important information about the efforts currently happening. See what issues are being talked about most - what hits home for IN? 

Have more ideas specific to the primary in IN? Ideas on the best talking points that will be most effective in IN to use in elevator pitches? We can do this. </TEXT>

We are all tired of election fraud. We are all tired of corruption. It is only all the more reason to keep fighting with Bernie.

If Bernie sweeps today, take the day off tomorrow (if you need it) and get right back at it on Thursday. If Bernie ties or loses by close margins, take the day off tomorrow (if you need it) and pick it back up on Thursday. 

Forget CTR trolls. If CTR is proof of anything, it's that the HRC campaign and her millionaire donors are SCARED. They have good reason to be. We can't make this an easy win for her like she wants.

Bernie will not give up - through every primary, every suspicion of election fraud, every moment of blackout in MSM, we need to be there with Bernie. 

Bernie wasn't supposed to make it this far. He has because of people like you. Do not give up. We're fighting a good fight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The neighbor's daughter made the headlines this weekend.

"27 Year Old Woman Shot in Head at Party"

Saturday morning around 6:30AM, we woke up to pounding, screaming, and crying. Assuming our neighbor had been locked out for the 3rd time this month, we tried to go back to sleep. The sound of sobbing echoed through the walls and we started to wonder if something else was wrong. 

After the 15 minute mark, we decided to call the police. When the dispatcher asked what the emergency was, I tried to explain how our neighbors are a quiet family, how it's unusual for this kind of behavior from them. When the call ended, we were staring out the window facing the alley, trying to follow the sound. 

Our neighbor, an older woman who's always the first to smile and say hello to you, is in the back of the house. We've found the source. She's screaming "my baby" between sobs. The rest of her family is piling into their car. Silence. The car pulls away.

The police arrive 2 minutes too late. We explained that we weren't sure what was happening, but thought a wellness check was in order. We said the family had just left, so there's probably no one there to answer their door. They said to call back if we hear anything else and wished us a good morning. 

We left Saturday morning and returned Saturday night. The block was lined with cars. Now we knew something awful happened. We're greeted by friends and family of the neighbors. When we ask, "how are you?", they respond with "our niece was murdered" and "they lost their baby girl". They tell us that she was shot in the head, that it very briefly made the news, and that Chicago was stupid. That people need to put the guns down. We let them know that we're right upstairs if they ever need anything, and we let them have their peace. 

Sunday morning is filled with more crying. There's screaming, arguing, "don't ever talk to me like that again". Emotions I can't even begin to understand. It carries on throughout the day. 

We run into the neighbor Sunday night, who says "I'm happy I caught you guys, I wanted to talk to you". He says he's sorry in advance, because there's going to be a lot of people coming in and out in the next few days. He tells us his daughter was murdered. His face says that it hasn't fully hit him yet. 

We let him know we're available for anything they need, and he apologises for making it a sentimental moment. A man whose daughter was just murdered is apologizing to us.

This is what's behind the "2 dead over weekend from gun violence" headlines. We read the headlines and carry on with our day. On the other side of that story, there's a broken family crying through all hours of the night. There are friends who feel they can't do anything more than say "I'm sorry".

There is more to this story that I can't quite fill in. This is only secondhand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been to every home game in S8 this season. I've heard S8 supporters actively rally against racism and homophobia. Game after game, S8 supporters are always there after the game to show the players our support. Last night hurt to be at. The puto screaming fans that were so loud you could hear it on the TV broadcast. We're a better club than that. Some S8 supporters stuck around after the game for Accam and Johnson. Some people actually booed Accam when he walked over. This is not our club. 

I'm at a loss. Who is actually going to the game Wednesday? They're running another Groupon so I'm assuming itll be similar to last night. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I keep putting off going to the gym today because I'm afraid of running into the Wednesday creep </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I tried asking last Wednesday in this sub after a run-in how you guys deal with creeps at the gym, but it came out crepes. 

Wednesdays are my leg day and I fucking love leg day. But for the last few weeks on Wednesdays, I've been running (at all different times of the day!) into this guy who has gotten progressively creepier. It started off with him complimenting my squats, asking if I was in a contest and saying that he would have run over and spot me after seeing the amount I was putting up IF I WAS A GUY, but was afraid of doing that for a girl because "people call the cops over that sort of thing". I took the contest part as a compliment and just went on with the rest of my routine. 

After that, it seemed like if he saw me at the squat rack on any Wednesday, he would just wait right behind me until I was done just to say one thing to me. I once went over to the weight section that only goes up to 60lbs to do some lunges since the normal section (across the gym) was way too full. He walked all the way over, made it seem like he was looking for something, looked up at me and commented about how much weight I was using. Just walked away after that.

Last week, I was squatting and he took the smith next to the squat rack I was on. Started chatting me up as I was racking plates, saying things like "quit messing around, just put two plates on already". I was happy to be done squatting because I thought he would just leave me the fuck alone already, but when I went to the machines HE USED EVERY FUCKING MACHINE THAT WAS BEHIND THE MACHINE I WAS USING. HALF OF THEM DIDN'T EVEN FIT INTO WHAT HE WAS WORKING ON THAT DAY. EVERY FUCKING TIME I MOVED TO A NEW MACHINE, SO DID HE. 

I don't want to come across as someone overly paranoid, but this is weird right? Like, you guys would be weirded out if someone did this to you at the gym? I'm sitting here in gym clothes ready to squat 215 newborn bears and I'm just dreading going for fear of running into this guy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted the exact same thing in /r/socialmedia a while ago because they had the same problem. I'm talking about the posts where the title says "X amount of ways to do X/Y/Z" and the post is nothing but a sentence and a link to the person's blog. Either these people are just trying to get more traffic to their blog, or they're digging for more emails. I have NO problem with people who link to their blog at the end of a post that's actually helpful. I'm just sick of seeing these spammy posts all over this subreddit. There's quite a few on the front page right now.

r/Startups has a rule that I think would be great in this sub: "If you are submitting your own blog content, the full body of the content must be included in the post, properly formatted for reddit. A link to the original blog post is allowed. One exception: you are allowed to make a (lengthy!) summary of the post if your content is longer than 2000 characters." </TEXT>
