	<TEXT> Yep. Besides being a total lunacy, it's a straight war right there. Let's not pretend - it was the US that set all the ME on fire - Iraq, Libya, Syria and it was their making to "fuck the EU" (as the other bitch AsstSoS Nuland declared openly) with the flood of immigrants which might as well bring the EU down. Same goes for the coup d'etat in Ukraine which brought the accession of Crimea to the RF and the war in Donbass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that tactic is called "bombing", didn't expect a 160 big flash mob will attempt it. I do believe women and kids were sent away initially, sounds too organized and if it was a remote location I guess the staff besides, being taken by surprise, also wouldn't dare chasing them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks and sounds good tbh. Now let Dems figure out what got them stuffed all over the country in the most pathetic way. Maybe her shitty mouth yapping about more wars and sticking it up to Russia ? Anyway for me it was lose-lose situation and I guess it had been like that for many others. I will def not shed a tear for the hypocrite. Especially now when I see all the obnoxious McCarthy rhetoric coming back. She got what she deserved, the American people - not so much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, I see s/o saying that 30K is the lowest wage and not average. The poster also says that the majority of women don't work in Moscow. How come and what gives (unless they are on maternity leave, let's say)? What else is not true from what he posts? Also economic hardships are not a reason to sparkle russophobia, such things exist worldwide, the US included (to be precise the % of ppl living under the poverty level is bigger in the US than in Russia, to say nothing about the poor members of the EU as Romania and Bulgaria or former USSR republics like Ukraine). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, this is not "The Miracle in Milan" movie by Vittorio De Sica where the whole city jumps on brooms and disappears in the sky. Are you trying to tell me that it took the Spanish police a couple of hours to arrive while the 160 could get on the public transport and safely arrive home so they couldn't catch them? What is that ? Another 'maana moment'? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, I know it's more work but I believe the national statistics are a bit different from the source you used for 2015 e.g. there were just 1130 Jews left in Bulgaria in 2011 (official national statistics online) and I believe there were even less than that in 2015 but it shows 2000 in your source. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can add organized crime to that and multiply the time they will have to do by factor of 3. Though it won't qualify as a grand theft but petty larceny as they will divide the 10k by 160. However the repeated offence could chime in too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Clinton had lots of plans for revitalizing rural america.

She lost royally and rurally. Don't ever remember her talking any essential thing about the economy. Don't ever remember the old hag being critical about the time she spend in the Govt. Serves her right. So either give a quote from her platform that confirms what you say or... you know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I said this is just a blanket standard mail send to everyone. It's NOT personally addressed despite the fact that the name of Churkin is there otherwise it would have at least a title as Mr before the name to say nothing that if it was really addressed to Vitaly Churkin, the Ambassador it should start with HE (His Excellence) etc. So that's nothing of essence and just media crap and PR stunt by the mission. McCain is a nasty and obnoxious old fart but he ain't no fool. And as I said that is illegal in the US. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They do blanket mailing requests for contributions.

	<TEXT> Not really. That means that the mfos in Kiev (whoever they are by that time) won't be able to sell the country's valuable assets for pennies and cash out the bribes for that kind of robbery i.e. this will prevent them from really running the country into the gutter and selling their own down the river. So basically Russia will have them by the balls and Ukraine will have just a geopolitical value void of economic such. Well, such assets don't last long as they require financial input without any return. </TEXT>
