	<TEXT> Sorry to disagree, but from what I've observed over the years, most Cleveland fans I know were only mad because of being rejected on national TV. LeBron himself has acknowledged that The Decision was a bad idea. I think Dan Gilbert had a come to Jesus moment on the letter he sent. 

Time heals all wounds. So does money and the chance to win a title in your hometown. 

EDIT: Also for what it's worth, the fan base that doesn't deserve him is Miami's. Those fans booed him in Game 4 of the Finals even after he led them  to four straight conference titles and two title games. I remember Cleveland fans applauding their team when San Antonio brushed them aside in the 2007 Finals.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've went back and forth between Cleveland and Miami all week, but I'm going with Cleveland. 

To me, it's such a perfect storm of events. Miami not only loses in the Finals, but gets dominated in a historic fashion. Afterwards, Pat Riley calls out the Big 3 in a press conference, even if all three took less money to sign there and Miami let Mike Miller go for ownership purposes. In the process, Wade looks bad and LeBron's supporting cast was horrible. 

Cleveland, on the other hand, unexpectedly wins the lottery and drafts Andrew Wiggins, one of the most hyped pro prospects in a long time. They have a nice core of young talent already and financial flexibility now and for the future. They may not win the title next year with LeBron, but they are set for the next five to seven years if James goes back there. Miami? Big question mark. 

Unless Riley pulls something out of his hat in the next 24-48 hours, I think LeBron goes home.  </TEXT>

That said, I don't think losing is the only reason this drama is happening.

	<TEXT> Gut feeling: LeBron's going to publish a logo of the team he signs with on Instagram or his Facebook page. There was something in a report about how his decision this time around would be quick, sudden and to the point. I think that's how he's going to do it this time. 

I think Monday is when we start seeing the dominoes fall one way or another.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Germany 3, United States 1: I just think Germany's too strong offensively to not at least score a couple goals on this team. USA has played well so far, but their defense has cracks in it and Germany is a major step up from Ghana and Portugal. I also believe the Gijon incident from years ago will motivate the Germans even more to play hard. That is already starting to pop up in media reports. 

I have no idea on Portugal-Ghana. Ghana missing a key piece Thursday will hurt them. Portugal is due to play well in one of these games. Gut feeling is a 1-1 draw.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - I thought the Spurs were finished after Memphis beat them in the postseason a few years back. Instead, they've won two conference titles and if this team closes it out, you could argue this was the best Spurs team ever. 

- I thought Spo wouldn't last in Miami and Riley would eventually run him off so he could coach LeBron. Instead, Spo's proven to be one of the best coaches in the league. 

- And one to show my age: I thought the Bulls/Magic series in 1996 would go down as one of the greatest postseason series ever. That Bulls team was great, but the Magic beat them a year before and Shaq/Penny were in their primes. Instead, the Bulls sweep them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may not be necessarily answering the question, but I wish Magic would have been able to finish out his career on his own terms. 

A lot of fans forget Magic retired at the age of 31, meaning he had at least five to six good seasons left in him. While he was older, he was still playing very well in 1991, averaging 19.4 and 12.5 assists. He also averaged 19, 12 and 8 against the Bulls in the '91 Finals without a completely healthy Worthy and Byron Scott. I still think the Bulls win the title that year, but it goes 6 or 7 with a healthy Lakers team. 

But if Magic plays five to six more seasons, I imagine Jerry West would have found a way to build a solid roster around him. Perhaps the Lakers trade for Barkley instead of the Suns? How about Magic, Shaq and Kobe on the 1996-97 team? 

A lot of what if's, but if Magic didn't get HIV, there may have been two more titles and three to four more Finals appearances in his column. If Magic retired with seven titles and 13 finals appearances, the debate between Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson becomes very interesting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LaGuerta's death practically meaning nothing for Season 8. Her death should have been the catalyst for the main plot of Season 8 --- whether it was Dexter being on the run again; a season-long Dex vs. Deb plot (who takes the fall) or motivating Batista to pick up where she left off on her own investigation. After all, he was married to her. 

There are things here or there I didn't like. I didn't like Hannah McKay. I wish Lumen could have lasted longer. I wish Brian's ghost would have hung around a little bit longer in Season 6. 

But LaGuerta's death hardly being mentioned in the final freaking season of Dexter was unforgivable for me.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> WANTED: Digital salesperson, 50 percent commission on all sales, thousands of leads available </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-17 03:58:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Edge Media Technologies is looking for an experienced salesperson to increase business for our network of local news Websites in Wyandotte County and Johnson County.

Edge Media Technologies publishes four Websites: The Kansas City Kansan (KCKansan.com), The Gardner Edge (GardnerEdge.com), The De Soto Edge (DeSotoEdge.com) and The Olathe Edge (OlatheEdge.com).

The Kansan and Gardner Edge have been in existence for nearly four years. The De Soto Edge and The Olathe Edge were launched in January 2013. 

Together, the Websites average over 70,000 different readers each month.

The position is commission only to start out with. The commission rate is 50 percent on all sales and is uncapped. The potential salesperson would also have thousands of leads available, as one-third of all economic activity in the State of Kansas happens in either Johnson County or Wyandotte County. In our four communities alone, there are at least 19,000 businesses.

We sell display advertising, business directory ads (similiar to chamber of commerce memberships) and job postings. 

The ideal candidate would have these features:

- At least three years of sales experience, with media sales a plus. Training in digital sales is available.

- The commitment to conduct follow-up calls. Most sales deals are closed on the fourth or fifth try in digital marketing.

- A self-starter with a record of working independently and "grabbing the ball and running with it" when it comes to closing deals.

- A great understanding of today's technology, particularly computers, mobile phones and social media - i.e. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

While this is a commission-only position at this time, as our company continues to grow, a negotiated salary could be determined down the road.
Though there comes risk with a commission-only position, there is high reward. This is a position that has high-income possibilities, combining our aggressive commission rates and the high leads already available.

Those interested in this position should email a resume, cover letter and references to Director of Marketing/Sales Joel Johns at joel@olatheedge.com and Nick Sloan at nick@olatheedge.com. </TEXT>

Having watched a lot of SEC football since Mizzou (my school) moved to the conference, Ford came up big in all of Auburn's games last year and he played his best when Auburn needed him most. He has a lot of confidence and I think the Chiefs got a good one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a Mizzou fan who watches a ton of SEC football, I like this pick for the Chiefs. He got better and better throughout the year. He gets to the quarterback and terrorized Mizzou in the SEC title game. 

He also saved his best performances in Auburn's biggest games, which says a lot about his character on the field.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jackson had his flaws as a head coach and there were problems behind the scenes, but the issue I have with firings like these is just like players, coaches improve and grow year by year. 

In the first eight years of his coaching career, Doc Rivers failed to win a playoff series in Orlando and Boston. He was on the verge of getting fired in Boston before they landed KG and Ray Allen. 

Flash forward to 2014 and Rivers is regarded by many NBA fans as a Top 3-5 coach in the league. The Clips traded a draft pick to land his services. 

I'm not saying Jackson's going to win a title, but his first three years as a coach compared to many are not too bad.  </TEXT>

I know Ollie's won a title, but I'd wait at least two years before hiring him.   </TEXT>
