	<TEXT> I totally agree OP. I know it's like comparing apples to oranges, but I prefer the animated film over the book. 

-The Bird and The Sword by Amy Harmon (You made me realize there is a parallel between this male protagonist and Howl) 

-Caraval by Stephanie Garber (It's a wild adventure with heart that definitely has a Miyazaki vibe) 

- Uprooted by Naomi Novik (There is social commentary that I think Miyazaki would approve of)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's okay OP, totally been there. Definitely start reading Neverwhere first. Ranking as in rating or ranking them in the order I would read them? For rating I would give them all a 5/5 stars. The way I placed them is the perfect order to read them. I'm really bad at describing books, so forgive me if the descriptions don't sound appealing. 

The Bird and The Sword revolves around a world in which people with special abilities are condemned. The protagonist has special abilities and she is made mute at a young age. She circumvents this hinderance with the help of a king. In the process she comes into her powers. 

Uprooted focuses on nature and magic. It's a great social commentary on what is happening with deforestation.

Caraval is a great journey in magic, mystery, and illusions. The writing invokes great imagery as well. 

The Grisha Trilogy also involves people with magical abilities. Their powers give them ranking, and the protagonist learns to harness her power through some trials. 

Resenting the Hero pairs people with magical abilities in order to stop natural disasters. The pairs become connected in order to be proficient enough to complete their jobs. The rub is when you are paired with someone you are not fond of. 

Hope this helps. Happy reading.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stay strong OP. Just keep taking small steps, one thing at a time. Look for a professional if you need it. The past is in the past, you can't change it, so there is no use thinking or worrying about it. Just make better choices in the present, and be kind to yourself. The world is full of people to tear you down so be your own best friend. Don't worry about what others think, their opinion is not who you are. You know yourself best. Good Luck OP. 

P.S. I just discovered the song Same Dark Places by JR JR to be comforting. 

Glad I could help with the poem! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Beau Taplin is a good contemporary poet.

"The way I love you is relentless. It breaks my concentration when I am busy and drifts my mind away to thoughts of you when I am in the middle of conversation. Like a desperate, needy child it pokes and prods tirelessly for my attention. And in the end, it always gets it.
