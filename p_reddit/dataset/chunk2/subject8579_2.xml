	<TEXT> A rather confident man walks into a bar and takes a seat next to a very attractive woman. He gives her a quick glance then casually looks at his watch for a moment. The women notices this and asks, "Is your date running late?" "No", he replies "I just bought this state-of-the-art watch and I was just testing it." The intrigued women says "a state-of-the-art watch? What's so special about it?" "It uses alpha waves to telepathically talk to me" he explains. "What's it telling you right now?" "We'll it says your not wearing panties..." The woman giggles and replies, "Well it must be broken because I am wearing panties" The man explains, "Damn thing must be an hour fast" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My 16 yr old 'friend' did this. She had a daughter that lived for about an hour due to all these problems which include multiple fingers on one hand disformation on the feet etc. 

Anyway once the baby had passed, she decided to dress the baby up and take a whole lot of picture of her cuddling it and sitting it up with her teddy bear and stuff. 

I guess this was just her way of grieving for her lost child but what made it even more weird was that she posted it all over her Facebook page and still continues to do so. It's just a bit unnerving seeing all these pictures of this baby all dressed up like it's alive and well whilst knowing that it is actually deceased in all the pictures. </TEXT>

Personally I use books, I find it comforting to know I can use them as an escape from my problems and I can just dive into either someone else's or escape to another world altogether :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That I find social events awkward and I am constantly self conscious the whole way through them, even family ones. This makes me not to keen on to go to them as I know I will not feel good all night and probably hide in a corner somewhere, until I have had quite a bit drink. I don't want to come across as boring to them as the rest if my family are really outgoing party people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lupin was always a very serious character in the books and although he did bond with him some what in the 3rd book I think they never really connected emotionally unlike how he did Sirius. Sirius was his dads closest dearest best friend, they knew each other ringside out, the thing harry has always dreamed of knowing so I think to harry Sirius was that link he was missing from his parents to himself, after all he is his god father. Also Sirius always told harry the straight out truth, or at least wanted to, about everything going on where as everyone else dodged around it trying to protect him when they were actually doing the opposite, so this brings them even closer  </TEXT>
