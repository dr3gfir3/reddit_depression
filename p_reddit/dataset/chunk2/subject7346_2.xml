	<TEXT> So let me give a little background about myself. I am currently 26 years old, Im married, and what I am about to share happened around 5 years ago and it still haunts me. I warn now that this story is pretty long, but after finally sharing the story with my husband, I want to know if Im alone in seeing this figure.

It all starts when I was living with my parents along with my brother and sister. I didn't have a job or car at the time and my boyfriend at the time (an ex well just call Cole) was working on trying to save up to get a place. I was a college drop out, my mom having convinced me that I would never amount to anything even if I went to school. My mother and I didn't ever see eye to eye and our relationship was toxic. She never abused me necessarily, but her dope habits at the time were not helping our relationship either. I was simply there to make sure my brother and sister were taken care of and to be there when they needed a sound minded adult. My mom didn't have a job and my step-dad was a trucker. All my mom ever did was lock herself on her room and never came out unless my step-dad was home and she wanted to play mom of the year, or to yell, scream, or slap some sense into us because we woke her up at 4 in the afternoon whenever my siblings came home from school.

One day, my step-dad announced that him and my grandpa had gotten a couple of trailer houses and they were going to convert it into a extra large trailer home. You know, with hillbilly rigging. A couple of months passed before the moving and merging was completed, but it was worth it. Despite us living in the middle of a horse pasture of my grandparents land in a couple of dumpy looking trailers, it was nice. Four bedrooms and four bathrooms, the second living room converted into a game room and my siblings and I had our own kitchen! After settling in, it was good for the first couple of weeks. It was the first time in our whole lives we actually had our own rooms. We felt like we're living like royalty! That is my brother and I did.

At about the second week, my sister came into my room one night claiming there was a man standing at her window. Concerned, I told her to hide under my bed, picked up my baseball bat, got my brother, and decided to check it out. My brother went outside and I went into her room. It was dark no light at all. Even with the full moon I had a hard time seeing around in her room. Nothing. I went to her window and looked around before opening the window. Bubba, you see anything? I called to him, expecting him to be behind the house still. To my surprise, he was actually right under the window. I jumped a little whenever he spoke, telling me that he didn't even see footprints. I looked down at him and kinda nervously laughed, shaking the little spook he gave me. My brother is about 511-6 tall. There's no way my sister could have seen a man looking at her through the window. Cmon Bubba, I think Sis just had a nightmare. There's no way someone could have been tall enough to be creepin in her window. He agreed and we shrugged it off. My sister slept in my room that night, too terrified to go back to her room. She was only 11 or 12, so I just brushed it off.

This happened a couple times afterwards, but it always ended up in my brother and I not finding anything and just going back to bed. One day, though, she claimed the man started hiding in her closet. Ill admit, I started to lose my patience with the matter. I pulled her with me to her room and slid open the door to find nothing. I scolded her for letting her imagination run wild and scaring herself. I forced her to sleep in her own bed that night. When I saw my mom the next day, I told her about it and gave her the whole spill about he whole situation. She flipped her shit and just accused me and my sister of just lying and coming up with crazy stories just to make her paranoid and crazy. This was normal. I just took my licks and rolled on. The only thing I could do in this situation was to just deal with my sister going through the monster in the closet faze rather late. Eventually she stopped coming to my room and I just assumed that she got over it. I was wrong

About a month after I told my mother about the man, my sister came to me in the morning before going to catch the bus. She looked tired and rather rugged. You ok, sis? You don't look like you got that much sleep. I asked. She didn't answer immediately. She looked around and gave a sigh, as if she was being forced to tell on someone. The man in the closet kept me up all night talking. My heart stopped for a second. He talked to her? Oh really? I asked, trying to keep calm and just remind my self it was her imagination or a dream. What did the man say? All he wanted to talk about was who he liked and who he didn't like. He just went on and on and on about people. He was even talking about people I don't know! She complained. I felt as though there was something extremely wrong and dark about the matter but I had to be strong for my sister. Well I tell you what! You can sleep in my room until dad gets back and Ill have him, Bubba, and Cole get together and chase the man away! How's that sound, sis!? I asked cheerfully to try and give her a smile before I left for the day. She just shrugged her shoulders. The man in the closet said he likes daddy and Bubba, but he HATES Cole. He said Cole is a dirty dick. I blinked and cleared my throat. Don't talk like that. It's ugly. You're not ugly. She sighed Im only saying what the man in the closet said! God she got mad and left. It broke my heart.

I spent the day inspecting my sisters room. I even deep cleaned it and organized it nice and good, hoping it would pep her spirit up. When I finished her room, I noticed my mom was up and she had her friend Darla over. Yes! I confronted my mom about the situation and thankfully it was one of her good days. My mom, her friend and I inspected my sisters room and outside. Nothing. I told mom I had found a section of the floor that opens up to under the house, but it was too small for anyone to get in. My moms friend decided to bless the house and cleanse my sisters room with her Gypsy hoo-doo herbs and crystals I just shook my head. When my sister got home the only thing she remarked on was how stinky the sage made her room never mind the tidiness.

There were no incidents that night or the next few nights. This made me happy. A week passed after the cleansing and it was my 21st birthday. My sister knew I had plans and left me a birthday card in my purse. Cole picked me up and got me wasted at one of the bars in town to celebrate. I had found the card in my purse when I went to the bathroom and showed it to Cole. It read Happy Birthday, Sissy! I love you! The man in the closet said that Cole is a dirty dick. Cole got pissed off and decided to take me home. He asked who the man was and I spent the whole car ride explaining the situation. He got extremely concerned and decided he wanted to be a Billy Badass. When we got home, he put me in my room and went to my sisters room. She was fast asleep. He inspected the room but found nothing. I had already fallen asleep before he returned to my room to go to bed. He stayed the night just to tell my mother off the next morning. I woke up to him screaming vulgarities to my mother and her quickly returning some back. Before I let them see me, I made sure my brother and sister were at school and to my luck they were. I didn't want them to have to deal with this. The argument boiled down to Cole accusing my mom of being a terrible mother for not being more protective of her daughter when she was saying there has been a man in her room. This got me involved and it eventually got so heated, my mom tried to grab me by my hair to slap me, but Cole shoved her into her room, threatening to call the police if she ever laid a hand on me again.

She locked herself into her room and cried while I tried to calm Cole down, but he just left. I was distraught. I waited a couple of hours before finally deciding to run away to Dallas. Cole had to go to his National Guard drills that day and I had a bunch of family on my biological dads side that lived there. After making a few arrangements, I was on my way. I thought that I wouldn't have to deal with my mom again. I knew I wasn't going to live in a shit home again. I wasn't going to be dealing with the man in the closet I was wrong on the latter
