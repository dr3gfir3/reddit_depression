	<TEXT> **CLARIFICATION: I did not buy only fake watches before this watch. I owned a few affordable quartz watches that I could wear every day and bang around. This is my first watch purchase that I'm super proud of. Hence calling it my first "real" watch purchase.**

Hi everyone! I'm new to the watch game and this subreddit.

Been wearing watches since middle school: Fossil, Baby-G, Casio, Timex but I figured since I'm in my late twenties, it's time to buy a "real adult watch." Saw this 1965 Seikomatic Weekdater and fell in love. I've never owned an automatic watch before and I can't believe what I've been missing out on!

As a female watch-lover, I was afraid it'd be a little too big for my wrist but this 38mm body looks perfect, I think. 

Loving this subreddit and can't wait to share my future purchases! </TEXT>
