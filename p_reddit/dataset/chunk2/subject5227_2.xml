	<TEXT> Calm down. Let me include the part that you left out:

They both aren't much different from each other beyond their rhetoric.

I'll show some examples (for anyone else interested) of how Trump's rhetoric doesn't match up with his staff, like on the TPP and lobbying. But busy at the moment.

Edit: A couple Republican delegates suggested banning corporate lobbyists from the party, but received blowback from others including Trump delegates. [SRC](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/18/two-delegates-propose-banning-corporate-lobbyists-from-the-rnc-get-crushed/)

And a [list](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/29/trump-team-tpp/) of Trump staff who support the TPP.

Not even the head of the largest derivatives marketplace in the world could see major policy differences between Hillary and Trump in regards to financial institutions.

	<TEXT> Sometimes media will actually spin leaks too. The one example I can think of was where msm said that a US diplomat was recorded saying a swear word. However, they ignored the rest of the recording where the US diplomat said things that sounded like the US handpicked a leader in Ukraine.

Will try to find a reputable source

	<TEXT> If there's any website you're a big fan of, you should also make a backup. Despite the rhetoric about 'once it's on the net, it stays there' - it doesn't hold up to reality if something you like is sufficiently obscure. E.g., I thankfully once saved an offiline version of an old website, using HTTrack, where the author died and it shutdown. I can still navigate through the website like as if it were still online.

This also goes for really anything else, such as YouTube videos - because accounts and videos can be taken down very easily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's also used any case that involves breaking DRM, including security research.

It's also used for a variety of other situations like **price fixing,** believe it or not. If you own a smart car, a mechanic will use a diagnostics tool that has to bypass the car's DRM protection. Thus, the maker of the tool (ie the maker of the car) will force the repair business to sign an agreement to use their diagnostic tool (which will bypass the DRM), which might include that the mechanic can only use parts made by the manufacturer in repairing the vehicle.

EFF member and sci-fi writer Cory Doctorow has talked about the problems of the DMCA at length. [Here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=zlN6wjeCJYk) is a recent talk he made at the Decentralized Web Summit that was hosted by the Internet Archive, graced (ironically) by the appearance of Tim Berners Lee.

I know for a fact Cory talks about it [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=f2IIoHNqJBs). He's a great speaker and I recommend listening to him if you commute anywhere or have time to listen.

Remember stories like this, and that the TPP is looking to expand copyright regulations, [NOT spread existing US Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trans-Pacific_Partnership_intellectual_property_provisions) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What Gingrich failed to mention in his enthusiastic endorsement of the MEK, however, is that the Iranian dissidents previously spent three decades trying to achieve their aim through terrorist attacks, and some of their first victims were Americans. He also avoided talking about the fact that the groups terrorist cell was once based in Iraq, where it was armed and protected by Saddam Hussein.

In recent years, as The Intercept has reported, the MEK has poured millions of dollars into reinventing itself as a moderate political group ready to take power in Iran if Western-backed regime change ever takes place. To that end it lobbied successfully to be removed from the State Departments list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2012. The Iranian exiles achieved this over the apparent opposition of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in part by paying a long list of former United States officials hefty speaking fees of between $10,000 to $50,000 for hymns of praise like the one Gingrich delivered on Saturday in Paris, where the MEKs political wing held its annual Free Iran gala. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't about free trade. Few tarriffs remain between the US and existing trade partners. It's about things like copyright expansion ([not just spreading current US laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership_Intellectual_Property_)). And to this day, it is still being presented in [extreme secrecy.](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160506/17281834365/european-parliament-orders-mep-to-take-down-video-about-his-attempt-to-visit-reading-room-trade-documents.shtml)

In the past, the USTR has admitted that it demands such secrecy because if it had to reveal its positions publicly, the public wouldn't support the agreement.

In the US, this has led to ridiculous situations such as when Senator Ron Wyden, who at the time was the chair of the Senate's subcommittee on international trade, was not allowed to bring a staffer of his, who is an expert in international trade, with him to read the latest text of a trade negotiation. Because that went against the rules.

And it's been standard practice in the US that if a politician does want to see the documents, they can't bring anything with them (not just no staff, but no electronics, no way to write anything down). They can just "read and retain." The EU has been following the US's lead on this, with special "reading rooms" for elected officials where someone watches over their every move. Again, they're not allowed any electronics. They are allowed a pen and are given paper to write on, which is a modest improvement on the USTR's system, but still ridiculous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Resistance/activism isn't only about voting. It's about resisting these trends in whichever way we can. It might be informing ourselves of the injustices so that we can angrily cite long lists of transgressions (backed by credible sources). The people responsible for those acts want us to forget them, and merely remembering them and reminding ourselves is an act of defiance.

Resistance might mean finding allies who openly take up these causes - people you can root for and cheer as they face huge challenges. Journalists, whistleblowers, organizations, and speakers.

Resistance might even be as little as changing small habits, e.g. using Tor to make mass surveillance more difficult.

Activism and resistance is about finding carthasis in how we express our growing frustration, not popularity.

And no matter how terrible or hopeless things seem, there are always people who are fighting against it. </TEXT>

Tip: if a site has been removed from Bugmenot (as they take requests to take down pages), do a site search with a search engine of your choice.

E.g., suppose nexusmods.com is blocked on Bugmenot, using StartPage.com as your search engine, search "nexus host:bugmenot.com"

The reason for this is that people will often hide credentials to banned websites by using similar names. I remember submitting a link as login.nexusmods.com used to work when nexusmods.com was banned (for example). </TEXT>

Kissinger: Ecevit can be very helpful. Art will see the Germans on the way home and also see Haig to see about getting surplus parts out of stocks. And [Ambassador David] Bruce was helpful.

Esenbel: The Europeans should find ways to meet quick needs; for example, the Air Force needs spare parts. For other items that they can't find in the stocks, maybe you could make a deal with the Dutch or others to send it here. 

Macomber: That is illegal.

Kissinger: Before the Freedom of Information Act, I used to say at meetings, "The illegal we do immediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer." [laughter] But since the Freedom of Information Act, I'm afraid to say things like that. We'll make a major effort.

So what do you reckon the joke is? </TEXT>

I bet there's going to be a lot of misinformation circulated that conveniently ignores the glaring double standard.

However, I wonder what the US intelligence community is thinking - such a double standard must be impossible to ignore considering secrecy is a huge aspect of their work/life. They likely are often reminded of what happens when they break it, even accidentally. </TEXT>

We can show political games, lies (like times CIA lied to congress), corruption, censorship, and surveillance   their consequences by tracking reliable/strong sources and staying informed ourselves.

Once I successfully showed to one person IRL that was pro censorship how that kind of power is [already abused   hurting people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Ivory_Coast_toxic_waste_dump#Suppressed_BBC_report)

*separation of powers, they ignored Congress' explicit defunding of an operation

And one of said liars (Poindexter) entered the private sector and was **HIRED BACK AS A CONSULTANT to the US DoD to start a [mass surveillance program](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office) that was defunded by Congress** and continued under the NSA under different names.

	<TEXT> I'm most concerned by the expansion of copyrights. Also the extreme secrecy it is being presented in is telling. [For example](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160506/17281834365/european-parliament-orders-mep-to-take-down-video-about-his-attempt-to-visit-reading-room-trade-documents.shtml)

In the past, the USTR has admitted that it demands such secrecy because if it had to reveal its positions publicly, the public wouldn't support the agreement.

In the US, this has led to ridiculous situations such as when Senator Ron Wyden, who at the time was the chair of the Senate's subcommittee on international trade, was not allowed to bring a staffer of his, who is an expert in international trade, with him to read the latest text of a trade negotiation. Because that went against the rules.

And it's been standard practice in the US that if a politician does want to see the documents, they can't bring anything with them (not just no staff, but no electronics, no way to write anything down). They can just "read and retain." The EU has been following the US's lead on this, with special "reading rooms" for elected officials where someone watches over their every move. Again, they're not allowed any electronics. They are allowed a pen and are given paper to write on, which is a modest improvement on the USTR's system, but still ridiculous. </TEXT>

There are four parties using drones in this area: the U.S., U.K., Russia, and the Iranian groups. It could have been any one of them,

But I'm most doubtful of the numbers they released because, as commenters keep pointing out, they have officially defined in the past 'military combatants' as males that are 16 years old or older.

Still, does that mean 64-116 women or young children were killed by drones outside of warzones? I'm looking forward to hearing adversarial journalism give their critiques. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Coming from /r/technology where there is often active discussion of ads and adblockers, this article somewhat shows (to me) how limited ad money has impacted journalist business models.

E.g., Politico has sponsorships with a few interesting advocacy groups.

Politicos nearly non-stop programming during the conventions is led by the outlets award-winning team of reporters and editors. In both Cleveland and Philadelphia, Politico plans to hold a Caucus Energy Conversation sponsored by Vote4Energy.org, an election effort of the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lobbying arm of Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other major oil and gas companies.

Politico is also hosting a discussion of the economy with the Peter G. Peterson Institute, an advocacy group that pushes for cuts to Medicare and Social Security. Other Politico convention event sponsors include Microsoft, Diageo, Google, and Bank of America.

Vote4Energy is also listed as the underwriter for The Atlantics cocktail caucus during the Democratic convention to explore the nations energy and environment landscape.

Their conclusion sums it up well:

But the role of media outlets in embracing the same strategies is the latest sign that the ethical boundaries of journalism are changing.

As traditional advertising revenue has collapsed over the last two decades, many newspapers and magazines have turned to sponsored events for income. 

Many media outlets have embraced native advertising, an industry term for advertisements that looks like editorial content, except for a small disclosure to identify the content as sponsored. In 2013, the Atlantic briefly hosted an advertorial from the Church of Scientology that promoted controversial leader David Miscavige. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But if the NSL is trying to identify a leaker by targeting the records of the potential source, and not the journalist, the Justice Department doesnt need to be involved.

Wow, that sounds like a rule on how to merely phrase the requirement.

The guidelines also specify that the extra oversight layers do not apply if the journalist is believed to be a spy or is part of a news organization associated with a foreign intelligence service or otherwise acting on behalf of a foreign power. Unless, again, the purpose is to identify a leak, in which case, the general counsel and executive assistant director must approve the request.

Even better, if the requirement claims the journalists are working with Russia - it's okay.

In seriousness, I wonder if that second part was specifically referring to Wikileaks. Whenever a Wikileaks or Snowden appears, it seems like rumors get spread that they're working for China or Russia. 

I get the impression this happens a lot internally because I once read about a FOIA requester who found out that gov officials were spreading rumors internally that the guy was crazy. Going to look for the source.

Thats exactly what Elizabeth Warren and Chris Murphy believe: **If the U.S. government views you as suspicious, that is proof of your guilt.** Thus, a suspect is the same as ISIS. </TEXT>

But we were barred from conducting discovery since 2008 because the government succeeded in putting evidence gathering on hold while it tried to get the case thrown outthereby preventing us from requesting important information about how the NSAs mass surveillance programs worked. But the government failed to get the case thrown out.

	<TEXT> Time Warner Cable's Maxx upgrades not only deliver faster top speeds up to 300 Mbps, but a notably overhauled improvement to the company's set top box interface. But Time Warner Cable has been telling company support techs and engineers that the upgrades were actually put on hold as of May 26.

The memo implies Charter is taking inventory of the acquired companies and is busy plotting a course forward.

"The Maxx Internet Speed Increase Program is currently undergoing review by our leadership team," says a memo obtained by Stop the Cap.

"As a result, all speed increases and customer communications were placed on a temporary hold beginning Thursday, May 26," states the internal communication. "Once the updated launch schedule is determined, updated hub schedules will be posted to KEY and area management will be notified. Customers will continue to receive notification when the new speeds are available in their hubs."

The article also warns to expect price hikes to happen later, but besides that - I don't think this article is saying what people are thinking it's saying. Wish they did use the better title you suggested. </TEXT>

Some members on the US Copyright Office [said weird things](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160517/17541834469/dozen-bad-ideas-that-were-raised-copyright-offices-dmca-roundtables.shtml) even after [receiving a letter from the EFF filled with takedown abuse](https://www.eff.org/document/eff-512-study-comments) (page 12 onwards)

[A statement from the source of the Panama Papers:](https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html)

...while Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the United States Treasury, just announced her resignation to work instead for HSBC, one of the most notorious banks on the planet (not coincidentally headquartered in London). And so the familiar swish of Americas revolving door echoes amidst deafening global silence from thousands of yet-to-be-discovered ultimate beneficial owners who are likely praying that her replacement is equally spineless.

But [Regulatory Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) describes only part of the story.

The [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) has been seen working with Republicans and Democrats.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate

And the State Department's efforts to [spread fracking into Poland (which would then hopefully spread to other countries)](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/23/hillary-clinton-fracking/)

An email dated December 3, 2010, shows that the State Department had Poland firmly in its bulls-eye and that companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Marathon Oil, Canadian firm BNK Petroleum, and Italian energy company Eni expressed interest in tapping into Polish shale. One official suggested enlisting Eni to help organize the pro-fracking campaign in Poland, as well as bringing in U.S. companies.

And the many quality reporting on the TPP and the TTIP   the secrecy and incredible power it gives to corporations (more than just extending US law)

	<TEXT> In its documentation of APFS, Apple explains that full disk encryption has been available on OS X since version 10.7 Lion. APFS differs in that it encrypts files individually rather than as a one unit, similar to other encryption mechanisms Apple introduced to its iOS platform in 2010. It also encrypts related metadata  the basic summary attached to each file  and will keen data secure even when the device has been physically hacked.

I am excited for what is coming from Apple as of late. 

Many of the features announced at WWDC expand security of user data, something Apple has been keen to promote as protecting user privacy. Safeguards include running artificial intelligence on the device itself, rather thanin the cloud, and using a technology called [differential privacy,](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apples-differential-privacy-collecting-data/) which anonymizes data Apple does collect from its customers. 

Also, the article mentions WhatsApp. Surprisingly, [OpenWhisperSystems helped them implement their encryption.](https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/)

Of course, there are still issues with all of these services/technologies (like privacy with WhatsApp, trusting closed source software with Apple) - but it is really nice seeing some of the positive actions they have taken.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well said. However I think mainstream media is a lost cause. Even in a perfect world where media is forced to 'fact check,' that's an easily abusable requirement. I don't think we ever want anyone to be forced to write something in a particular way. I think it's best to just avoid them and point out the holes in their reporting (e.g., I have [lots of NYT examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4n3sny/according_to_ceo_thompson_of_the_new_york_times/d428qle), and it's easy to point how quickly MSM stopped reporting on the NSA disclosures and focused entirely on Snowden)

There is quality investigative journalism out there, it's often a matter of finding them and keeping up with "what needs to be changed, what terrible new laws or agreements are on their way, and who is a bad actor and needs to be publicly denounced or removed from office" etc.

You're right, there is so much disinformation and obstacles to breaking down traditional world views. Still, I think education/raising awareness has a lot of potential. There are many stories that are undeniably terrible and eye opening to anyone. IRL I've made people reconsider their stance on surveillance and censorship with reliable/strong sources detailing raw   brutal truths, like how UK censorship laws were [abused](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire_toxic_waste_dump) in the Trafigura case to benefit a company that was hurting people.

	<TEXT> I think we can somewhat counter it by raising awarenes, online   IRL, that old cards like "Democrats vs Republicans," "liberals vs conservatives," and "us vs extremists" are complete bs. With reliable sources/evidence, we can show the abuses of power, the injustices, and common tricks that elites use to obtain influence   distract the public.

Additionally, I think the astroturfing problem is only going to get worse and posting sources   evidence is the only counter I can think of. The reason being that I still read comments that are heavily downvoted   I bet others do too. If people still end up reading evidence/sources, astroturfing has failed in completely stamping out information from spreading.

Have any ideas about the problems we're facing now   in the future? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Huh? Deep into conspiracies? The Wikipedia article (which is based on the Associated Press articles) I linked on the "journalists have been surveilled and prosecuted by the DOJ" bullet is an example of abusing surveillance power. 

I think you mean dragnet mass surveillance is overrated. I agree with part of that, in that it hasn't been helpful for preventing attacks. However, it can be turned on activists, whistleblowers, and journalists (such as in the above case). It also contains a lot of blackmail or discrediting information that can be used against political opponents. 

Recently [Forty-One Secret Service agents tried to access a Congressman's private data to discredit him,](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160604/13455634625/forty-one-secret-service-employees-punished-illegally-accessing-congressmans-private-data-hopes-discrediting-him.shtml) and the punishments were mostly warnings. 

if an incident occurs, then they winnow in on a specific person and make connections

Somewhat. It depends. If we're talking about their program SKYNET[1], they try to use machine learning algorithms to make predictions about behavior which escalates people on kill lists. Unfortunately, a data scientist has [estimated](http://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2016/02/the-nsas-skynet-program-may-be-killing-thousands-of-innocent-people/) that thousands of innocent people are being misclassified - and possibly killed as a result.


 But to actually get info about a person while on line or the phone? Not possible.

This confused me. Do you mean in terms of their technical capabilities? They already have programs to automate infecting devices such as [TURBINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TURBINE_%28US_government_project%29) and the [QUANTUM programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations#QUANTUM_attacks).

and the largest surveillance program in history existed and grew for over a decade without public knowledge.

With such lacking transparency, how do you hold the executive branch accountable? Wouldn't you say credibility is important? If someone is willing to lie now, what will happen when keeping secrets becomes even easier?

	<TEXT> I wouldn't blame the general public too heavily this time. There's an unusually high sentiment that the election is a rigged game. I mean, even the [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) has been seen working with Republicans and Democrats.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate

It's a game run by   for elites. If we are to protect our civil liberties from unrelenting assault, I think paying attention to this game (not the tabloid trash)   showing others is in our interests.

Public scrutiny of their methods is the last thing they want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hillary also said she's always has been [against fracking.](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/23/hillary-clinton-fracking/)

If you do not wish to read it (or trust the leaked documents), here is a direct quote from Hillary on [State.gov](http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/04/140286.htm)

the United States will promote the use of [shale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale_gas) gas. Now, I know that in some places is controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources. If developed, shale gas could make an important contribution to our regions energy supply, just as it does now for the United States.

Why is it hard to accept that a politician can lie? If we stopped arguing about which party is better, we could together watch [Candidate Obama argue with President Obama over government mass surveillance] (https://youtube.com/watch?v=7BmdovYztH8) or [Donald Trump arguing with himself over foreign policy.](http://nytimes.com/2016/05/01/opinion/sunday/donald-the-dove-hillary-the-hawk.html?ribbon-ad-idx=6 rref=opinion referer=) </TEXT>
