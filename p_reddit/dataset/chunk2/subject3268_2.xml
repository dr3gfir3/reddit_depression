	<TEXT> Free car thing: I live the furthest away and I can get away with saying it's because of that. The trips away, in the motor trade there is always lots of trips and courses etc. Loads of others in my office go away on trips with Salesmen, assistant Managers, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I was only 17 at the time I couldn't buy drink at our Christmas party. So he started buying me a few drinks, and I made a small flirtation along the lines of ''You're trying to take advantage of me'' etc etc. But after a few I came to realise that he was indeed wanting to take advantage of me. Because I found him exceedingly attractive, I slept with him.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the comment, but I really have no guilt about this anymore. When it first started out, I did feel awfully guilty, but now I don't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not particularily. He's wonderfully sexy, but I do find myself getting jealous sometimes if I see other girls in the office flirt with him.  </TEXT>

The nastiest place was in him and his wife's bed, it made me feel weird though so we never did it there again. That was at the very start of our affair.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My sister knows, I think my brother has suspicians to. My sister found out after I turned up at her house in one of the swanky cars I get at work which I'm not meant to. She made a joke along the lines of ''are you getting all these cars 'cos you're bedding your boss?'' Which at that point, my stunned silence said it all.

She doesn't approve of it but she knows that it is not just a sexual fling. I know that if I do find the right person, I will end the affair, but at the moment I will carry it on. </TEXT>
