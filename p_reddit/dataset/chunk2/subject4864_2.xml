	<TEXT> Check out the Fallout 4 top 25 mods on Nexus. I like the weather mod as it really creates a more realistic mood. There are many weapons mods - I like the M14 mod. I use visible companion affinity to see how much my followers like me. The armorsmith mod adds a new dimension to modding armor including eyewear. Right now I try and avoid anything that will throw off the balance of the game, so I avoid cheat mods - but in FONV I did use the unlimited companions mod and cranked up the difficulty.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cards are subjective and everything needs context. There is so much more going on with your question. Do you have a negative self-image? So often people turn to the cards for divination answers to how other people think or feel when it is us who is creating the situation in the first place. Always start with yourself in your readings and post up here for additional insight. The hardest people to read for are ourselves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These types of relationship divination spreads always rubbed me the wrong way. This particular one places an interesting amount of  emphasis on appearance which leads me to believe it is popular with teenagers. They key to a quality relationship is having as much self awareness of our motivations and fears as possible. Yet, so many people only want to address the fulfillment of their desires. 

Addressing some of these cards - the 10 of swords is hitting rock bottom and speaks to moving on after. In some ways, I see it as the minor arcana Death card in the same way as the 2 of cups is the minor arcana Lovers. I've always felt these minor majors are on a more personal level and are something we have more control over as opposed to the spiritual forges of the major arcana.

The Devil is more complicated - he is telling you that this relationship ideal that you have created exists and someone is out there that will fulfill it. An unfortunate lie that will have you trying to impose your reality on another person to which the only end is disappointment.  

Why waste your time with a powerful tool trying to divine a future that you will superimpose your own desires? Like so many people, you will get frustrated with the Tarot and feel it doesn't work. Look to it for self discovery and find friends and do readings together.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats! The LCP that's the one I carry. Make sure you take it to the range and put 100+ rounds through it. It's small, and until I got a good grip, I would occasionally hit the mag eject button and it would jam. I can't say it's the most fun to shoot, it's got a hard slide and trigger pull - but that's better because it does not have a safety. Still, for around $250 it's a great deal and it's very small. I like it!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. You should not need to take the CCW course if you are military, but you do need to be 21.  You apply at the tax collectors office - Check the website to see what documentation you will need and to make an appointment. I don't know the requirements compared to a resident,  but you can get a non-resident CCW.
2. I know my FL CCW is valid in (I think) 37 states. It's less for non-resident CCW holders, but Alabama is OK.
3. I like the Ruger LCP as it is a tiny 380 and can be found for around $259-$279, but definitely ask around. </TEXT>
