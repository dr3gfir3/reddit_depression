Every society in human history has kept human figurines in their presence. Theres a reason for it; but ask ten different people and youll get ten different reasons why we do so.

In the summer of 1868, the Kolmer family lived in a cabin on what was then Minnesota frontier land. Mr. and Mrs. Kolmer had just one child; Addie was eight years old. 

When her grandmother visited that summer, she brought Addie the gift of a small figurine, eighteen inches tall, with cobalt blue eyes.

Mama, I dont like this girl. She looks at me.

Addie, her mother scolded. It was a gift.

Shes right, Addie, her father said sternly. Besides, she looks so much like you. The same blonde hair, shes even got a red dress just like yours.

Papa, I dont like her. And my eyes are brown. Shes not like me at all.

Her mother picked up the figurine and brought it into Addies bedroom, setting in on the bureau facing the bed. It stays here, and thats final, she said, placing her hands on her hips.


The next morning, Addie came to the breakfast table looking haggard. 

Whats wrong, Addie? her father asked. Why are those brown eyes so red?

Addie turned a bloodshot look toward him. She says she wants my eyes. 

Her mother laid two bowls of steaming oatmeal in front of Addie and her father. What do you mean, Ad?

The girl swiveled her reddened eyes to her mother. I couldnt sleep. It only talks in the quiet. She opens my ears when I close my eyes.

Her mother hardened. If this is about your grandmothers gift, Ill have none of it. Its in your room, and shes staying there.



The next morning, Addie looked even worse. She kept dropping her eyelids and nearly falling into her oatmeal, but would catch her self with an abrupt jerk of the head every time. Upon waking, she would glance around as though terrified. 

Her father placed a hand on her shoulder. Whats going on now, Dee? Are you sleepy?

She whipped a bloodshot glance at him before dropping her eyes again. Addie snapped awake. She uses she uses the quiet for words. Dori, Ori, Laso, Laso. Dori Ori Laso Laso. 

Her eyelids fell in place and stayed there for five seconds. When they shot open again, she sprang out of the chair, wiped her hands on her red dress, and sprinted out the door into the sunlight. Mr. Kolmer raised his eyebrows in concern at his wife; she crossed her arms and remained stoic. 


At night, they heard it too. It was far too aggressive to be a whine, too mirthy to be a growl. Mr. and Mrs. Kolmer raced from their beds and sprinted toward their daughters door. Mr. Kolmer grasped the knob furiously and pulled on it, but could not overcome the resistance. 

The door had no lock. 

Addie screamed from the other side of the door  not a loud scream, because people only scream loudly when they have hope of being saved. She screamed because it was impossible to express herself through tears alone. 

Theres no window on that side of the cabin! Mr. Kolmer yelled, his knuckles white, eyes wide and wild. We have to open this door!

There was an odd splashing sound from the other side. Mrs. Kolmer wailed.

Mr. Kolmer sprinted outside the door while his wife tugged fruitlessly at the knob. She collapsed in sobs, pawing weakly at the wooden frame.

Tears of blood, crying tears of blood. They were the first clear words from the other side of the door. It sounded very much like Addie and very unlike Addie at the same time. 

The husband came barreling back into the house wielding an axe; she barely dodged the swing in time. He used the momentum from his run to bring metal upon metal; it bounced off with a ding, and Mr. Kolmer careened into the door and sank to the ground. 

His wife was crying openly now, and the sounds coming from the other side simply lacked description. They were not nice. 

The man brought himself into a kneel, and raised the axe far above his head. He brought it down upon the door with all his anger; it bounced violently back, cracked him on the forehead, and rendered him unconscious before he had hit the floor. 

Mrs. Kolmer crawled over to him and cradled his face. Fresh sounds brought her attention to her daughters door frame, and she crawled as far as she could before the door stopped her advance. She scratched vainly at the wood. Scratching returned from the other side, and Mrs. Kolmer furiously dug her nails in, hoping against hope that her daughter was trying to communicate with her. 

It took two full minutes before she realized that all of the scratches were exact imitations of her own; whatever was on the other side of the door was mocking her. 

Mrs. Kolmer clutched the doorknob and rested her face in her arms. She did not know how much longer Addie would be able to cry, but from the sound of it, it wouldnt be much time. 


Mr. Kolmer awoke first. Dappled sunlight shone on the rug, the hearth, his wife. She still lay slumped against the door, passed out from exhaustion.

The world waved under his feet as he unsteadily rose; blood caked the side of his face, and his balance was loopy at best. 

When he fell to the ground, his face stopped inched from his wifes eyes. They immediately bolted open, completely bloodshot. She was confused for only a moment, then scrambled in horror as she took in the sight of the bloodied man.

Addie, Addie! the man screamed, and forcibly pulled his wifes panicked figure from the doorway. 

This time the doorknob worked. He threw his weight into the wood and stumbled into the room. There he stopped. 

His daughter was dead. She lay on the bed, perfectly still. She might have been sleeping, but she was not moving at all, and her eye sockets were empty. Dry, cracked blood caked her face in twin paths between her eyes and her shoulders. 

Mrs. Kolmer sprinted past her frozen husband and scooped up the corpse that had been her daughter. She screamed.

Mr. Kolmer walked slowly, unsteadily toward the scene. His dead daughters face sat on her mothers shoulder, dead skin already beginning to droop as her head lolled to the side. 

He sat slowly on the bed and rested his hand on her neck. Mr. Kolmer pulled his hand back quickly; her skin was unnaturally cold, and he was not prepared for it. 

His wife slowly laid the body back on the bed and pulled away, her sobs now frozen still by shock. They sat and stared for a moment at the body. It would have been looking up at the ceiling if it still had eyes.

The corpse reached out its icy left hand and grabbed Mr. Kolmers wrist. He was too petrified to react at all.

Addies body rotated its head to her mother, fixing its empty sockets on her eyes. It spoke, with resolve, in her daughters voice.

Dori. Ori. Laso. Laso.

Then she was still.

It took several moments before Mr. Kolmer finally found the emotional strength to pry his dead daughters fingers from his wrist. Her muscles had already started to stiffen, and they did not come loose easily. 

He dropped the wrist limply to the bed. 

Mrs. Kolmer looked where it landed. It was only then that she noticed that the trail of blood continued across Addies blanket, down to the floor, across the room to the bureau. There, the caked blood rose up across the face of the drawers and to the feet of the standing figurine. 

It had brown eyes. 


The story circulated across an expanding nation. It is still recalled today, when people use the acronym of the chant to describe these housebound figurines.
