To do that, go to contacts  settings  import/export 

Export the contacts to device storage first, then do the same steps but import. When you import it will ask what account, Google or phone and choose Google.

Not to mention, your "huge premium" is hardly more than a non UDP customer AND you aren't paying for a home ISP. 

Playing the "I live in a rural area and have no options card" is probably the most tilt inducing thing ever, move then if you require high speed Internet at home.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not if it has LTE. You'd have to activate it and get service and a credit check. 

If you have Verizon already then it's just $5/mo for the service, not sure what the point of getting an LTE model would be if you can t afford that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But that's not how it works unless you get promotional trade in credit. 

Plus, why shouldn't you have to pay off your financial obligations to your previous carrier? Should Verizon just go out on a limb and pay $1500 just for you to switch back or something?  </TEXT>

People who don't rely on the phone as much or who are only doing minimal things don't need to spend $700. </TEXT>
