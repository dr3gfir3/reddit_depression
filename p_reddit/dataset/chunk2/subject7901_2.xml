	<TEXT> This is best understood by Karl Marx, who said that wages would fall to the price necessary to reproduce the supply of labor.  In the U.S. the cost of reproducing a skilled labor force has gotten higher than the income earned by labor. The fix is to get cheaper labor elsewhere, whose education, health, etc. are paid for by others.  Goodbye. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Viewing your election from over the pond, and from left-internationalist eyes, it looks like Labour has no convincing answers to working class concerns about jobless futures.  UKIP's immigrant phobia is not a good answer, but it's better than nothing.  SNP does offer hope: anti-austerity both in Scotland, and more widely, in a democratic Europe.  Perhaps it will reawaken the spirit of Keir Hardie in England, and release Labour from its self-defeating loss of vision. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  this little-known provision in the tax code, known as a like-kind exchange, has become a popular tactic for a new niche of investors: buyers of high-end art who want to put off - and sometimes completely avoid - federal taxes ... The exchanges have become prevalent enough, and the cost to the government significant enough, that the Obama administration is seeking to eliminate them, a prospect causing no shortage of alarm in sectors of the art world...  Lawmakers in Washington, meanwhile, are receiving phone calls and letters from the growing corps of like-kind exchange advisers in opposition to eliminating the exchanges.
Experts say the use of the tax break has expanded in response to surging prices for art and the rising number of savvy investors, often veterans of the real estate industry or Wall Street, who have come to view paintings and sculptures as tradable commodities.

What is "high-end art" really worth? The answer appears to depend on how much of your tax obligation you can avoid, as you bid up its price.
It will be interesting to see who among our legislators will justify continuing this tax scam.

	<TEXT> Consider tactical voting. That means that if you live in a clearly Red or Blue state, you can vote your conscience, and send a message.  On the other hand, if you live in a "battleground" state, the stakes are higher.  For myself (someone who is addicted to voting), if I lived in a battleground state, I'd probably hold my nose and vote lesser-evil.  But for anyone in a battleground state who can't stand voting for Hillary, vote Green (or another party that conforms to your beliefs).  Your vote would not change the outcome of the contest, but it is a vote against cynicism, which is the big-time ally of entrenched power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I support Bernie Sanders' run in the Democratic primary because it's the only way that the public can be reached to get engaged in the real issues that he raises.  The danger of the move, however, is to bring another generation of movement activists into the Democratic Party, the way that Jesse Jackson did in 1988.  The DP is an institutional roach motel for progressives.  You enter at great peril to your integrity.  I am registered as a Democrat to vote in primaries in NYC.  But I vote Green Party, which, in New York has a  line on the ballot as long as it gets 50,000+ votes for Governor.  As its candidate for President, Jill Stein did a great job raising issues.  But the audience is still small.  I hope that the Green base will grow as people who support Bernie look around for a long-term base for talking and acting politically.  In the U.S. electoral system a vote for Green Party may turn an election in a perverse direction. In 2000 the Florida vote for Ralph Nader, if it had gone for Al Gore, would have given Gore a clear victory in Florida, which would have made him President.  I have supported "strategic" voting in the Presidential election.  That would mean that small progressive parties would not contest in close states, but would campaign actively in both "red" (Republican) and "blue" (Democratic) states.  That would let the message and organization develop.  This is not an elegant position.  It is an acknowledgement that a progressive program does not have enough support now to take the Presidency.  But I hope that the Sanders run will help reveal a broader base of support for a progressive program than anyone anticipated.  Being part of an independent institutional structure that is participatory and democratic (i.e., not the Democratic Party) is necessary for a new movement to grow with integrity.  Bernie's integrity is unimpeachable precisely because he never had to be a DP loyalist.  I hope that the next generation of radicalized Americans follow the same path, and prevails. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may be right about the EU.  I myself am not a social democrat but a libertarian socialist.  That's as close to anarchist as you can get while recognizing that capitalism has fatal flaws (speculation and bubbles are built into the DNA).  A cooperative libertarian society strives for decentralization, with as little structure as we can get away with.  But what structure is needed is a social construction that must be democratically decided on.  The sustainable society of the 21st century, if it is to happen at all, must minimize waste.  That means high utilization of resources.  Public goods like parks vs. lawns, transit (including smart taxi options and car-sharing) vs. multiple private cars, etc. are what we need.  But for that to feel desirable means that sharing must not be Procrustean.  We are now close to having a technology to implement freedom and cooperation without paying the lion's share of our effort to the .01% whose claims of indispensability  have proven to be a consumer fraud.  They hijacked decision-making on what gets produced and how. Their claims of entitlement to that power must be questioned, and, just perhaps, rejected.  A culture of participatory democracy is the only possible alternative to unsustainable capitalism or unbearable bureaucratic collectivism.  It requires staying involved and open, and not trusting others to do your thinking for you.  Creating that culture is worth fighting for.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The American standard of living is doomed in a world where multinational corporations are the only recognized stakeholders. They get to know the rules that will be imposed by the TPP (and the other treaties that will be based on it) before the governments do, because their "experts" are on the drafting committees.  Unions did not drive manufacturing out of the U.S.  They were just too weak to hold back the exodus to countries with cheap wages, and low health and environmental standards.

Sometime after U.S. economic well-being peaked in the early 1970s, people bought the line that the government is the problem. And this is the result of the ensuing politics -- a government beholden to business, without the internal morale to govern properly. Dedicated public service is viewed as a quaint notion, not to be taken seriously. It didn't have to be this way.

Many Americans now anticipate that their children will do worse than they have. They do not see how the stagnating standard of living of the lower 90% can even be sustained. Unless it is supported by real production, the American standard of living is, indeed, not sustainable. 

The American Way of Life can be maintained only temporarily, through the use of our previously accumulated wealth and power, which we are currently expending to support consumption greater than the value of what we produce. The fearful majority, who propelled the Republicans' 2014 election victory, understand that the U.S. still remains an attractive place to make a living. But what does America produce that cannot be produced elsewhere cheaper? Primarily (1) stuff that must be made or done here to be sold here, in this still rich country -- retail, houses, hands-on healthcare, etc.; (2) resource-based industries -- principally agriculture and fossil fuel production; (3) the military-industrial complex, whose costs have become too expensive to bear as America's overall economic body weakens; (4) high-end technology, which quickly gets manufactured elsewhere (iPhone, etc.); and (5) financial and managerial services, which have been growing as the real economy stagnates, propped up by the dollar as the prime global currency. 

American military power is key to keeping superpower privilege intact. Why else should capital markets, and the lucrative financial services industry they support, remain based here, even as the center of gravity for global economic activity moves east to Asia? 

Now added to this mix are the shale oil and fracking boom, which are being sold as the fountain of revitalization for manufacturing. This is in total contradiction to our long term interest in combating climate change.  The policy contest on this issue is heating up, and is not going away. On the one side is the need to confront the emerging climate disaster revealed by science, in a world increasingly beyond the grasp of American control. On the other side is a deep ideology that believes in American exceptionalism, and must increasingly deny reality in order to keep its confidence up. Delusions of grandeur --belief in a divine right to continued dominance -- are the hardest of illusions to break. 

Capitalism is a system designed to reward winners. Losers are a "social problem". The real question is whether most people, being economically unnecessary, will continue to be fed. To the extent that the society rejects social answers to social problems, we are in trouble.

The world has limited resources, and limited ability of the environment to absorb the unconsumable byproducts of production (global warming is just one aspect of this). Reality presents threatening questions, and the political class offers no real answers. As of yet, no one on the political stage is pointing our attention towards a modest but humanly acceptable future. It's time to call for a new script and new players on stage to surprise and awaken us back to living the possible life.

Bernie Sanders points in the right direction.  He's too radical for business-as-usual America.  He talks about the real world.  But his Keynesian solutions are not radical enough to reconstruct America along sustainable lines.  I plan to volunteer in his campaign so that I can help start the conversation we need, once we start asking the right questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Growth of inequality is the product of a game whose rules are set by the winners.  If the game were fair, inequality would stabilize, reflecting the rewards needed to elicit efforts.  Are the efforts that are receiving increasing rewards for the winners becoming more onerous or risky? Probably not.
Rather, the winners have the power to withhold their money from use. It may earn nothing. But it is not lost forever like time, nor does it have to eat.  With no bargaining power, labor's share of the national product has fallen to an historic low. Increasing inequality no longer can be justified as the price we have to pay for a prosperous economy for everyone. The magic of the market is not working. Increasing inequality means lack of sustainable final demand.  The crisis of the market is summed up by the question: Investment in what?  Instead of real progress, we're getting bubbles, stagnation, and competitive currency devaluations. Something new is needed. How about investing in climate resilience (and minimizing further climate damage)? We'd be a lot better off that way than we will be otherwise, globally. But there is no private market mechanism that will take us there. Climate change, resource limits, globalized production are the background conditions. We cannot afford waste -- neither of resources, nor of people. There is more than enough work that needs to be done. We need a fresh perspective and a political sea change.

	<TEXT> As usual, David Brooks marshals information to prove that the problems of the poor are the result of their own cultural deficits:
 The problem is not lack of attention, and its not mainly lack of money. 
...
 But the real barriers to mobility are matters of social psychology, the quality of relationships in a home and a neighborhood that either encourage or discourage responsibility, future-oriented thinking, and practical ambition.

Differences in power never enter Brooks' mind as a factor in how well people do in life.
What's needed in Baltimore and elsewhere is a process which rebuilds communities with a vision in mind -- sustainability in the world of the 21st century.  Climate change, resource limits, globalized production are the background conditions.  What we know now, that can let us start to build for the future, is that we cannot afford waste -- neither of resources, nor of people.  There is more than enough work that needs to be done.  Skills must be developed.  And people must be involved in a realistic conversation about what is possible in a post-consumerist world, where we must share public spaces convivially.  Cities are needed.  They must be desirable places to live -- not hellholes for the dispossessed. 
When people have channels to work for desired goals, they become capable of working together -- even as the Bloods and the Crips came together to form the thin line of sanity separating an enraged tormented population from their tormentors.  The peace they created is the precondition for justice. But without justice, no peace can hold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The views of older voters deserve scrutiny. They worry that redistribution will come at their expense, in particular via cuts to Medicare, 

What will it take to convince people that greater economic justice can be achieved without harming "middle class" people whose heads are barely above water?  

What's needed first is a public educator who can explain why inequality has ballooned since the 1970s -- the same period in which the "Great Society" welfare state came under attack, and income was shifted from wages to profits.  

The business-friendly state since the '70s has focused on "incentives to invest", produced an economy overwhelmed by its speculative financial sector, and hollowed out the guts of the productive economy.  

As America's economic strength recedes, people who are still afloat think that they'll sink further if they try to save  anyone else.

Until someone (Bernie Sanders? Elizabeth Warren?) raises the bigger question of economic direction, the call for increased social-economic justice will seem like dangerous liberal do-goodism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is not so simple as "trade is good".  Setting the conditions under which trade is undertaken in a globalized economy comes down to: Whom do you trust?  Trade deals which are written by corporate "stakeholders" are bound to tilt the game in their favor, even if they claim to "address" concerns about working conditions, the environment, health, etc.  Until there is a democratic process, no deal is better than a contract that we blindly sign.  Making the rules of trade is a process, and it has been hijacked.  They're at the controls, threatening to crash the system unless we click "I Agree".  That is the death of democracy.  The alternative, which is admittedly difficult, is that democracy must be globalized. </TEXT>

In other words, there is a point of diminishing returns, and then absolute loss, associated with applying pressure on a debtor country.  It does not add to discipline over the others if even one country slips out of the net of control.  This is not a threat but an analytical statement. The risk to creditors must go up with Grexit, and that drives capital away from other weak economies -- a vicious cycle. </TEXT>

And enforcement agents must have incentives to stay independent, with no prospect of being captured by the regulated.

He thought he could force American backing for Israeli policy in Iran -- a policy which is geared to start a war, which America would be compelled to fight -- to save Israel.  Now it is clear that Netanyahu has crossed the line,  Israel can no longer base its bragadocio on its certainty that the U.S. will come to the rescue, no matter what.  Democrats, who have been the object of Netanyahu's contempt for years, are learning that they need not be afraid.  They are learning to just say no.  Enough is enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Varoufakis is a game-changer.  The question is-- can he sell his new game in which debt-holders' interests are linked to the success of the real economy of Greece.  To make the new game credible, Syriza has to be credible itself.  It must have the power to successfully confront and replace Greece's longstanding corrupt political-economic establishment.  Because if they stay with their power and interests intact, nothing productive will be built, and Greece will remain pauperized. A desperate Greek people have shown themselves willing to bet on Syriza to win this fight.  Varoufakis now has the trickier job of proving to the European financial establishment that they should give Syriza the chance it is asking for -- to throw the Greek oligarchs off the boat.  That might save the Greek people, and give the best return possible on the Greek debt that the troika holds.  But it would be a breach of class solidarity in the club of rulers.  Which side are they on? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What if Greece establishes the New Drachma as a dual currency which would be the required means of payment for the portion of taxes 
budgeted for domestic spending?  

The supply and price of ND would initially be set by the State to be equivalent to one year of  revenue, but then would  be determined by supply and demand as recipients of ND converted them to s to the extent required  to make  other purchases.  ND would be legal tender for all domestic payments at the current exchange rate with s.

The initial distribution of ND would take two forms -- sale of ND for s to cover taxes and as payment for domestic government obligations.

The government could issue or retire ND based on revenue needs and the value of the currency.  

The objectives of this course of action would be (1) to align government expenses with domestic  revenue sources; and (2) to maximize the employment of domestic resources -- which would accept payment in ND while external sellers would probably not be willing to take the currency risk without receiving a larger risk premium.

Assuming that the ND depreciates relative to , then the price of Greek goods would decline relative to the price of international goods.

The real drawdown of externally held debt would not begin until Greece establishes a balance of payments surplus.

The long term direction of the Greek economy can be as the leading edge of a sustainable Europe in a world in which material growth will be increasingly limited by resource constraints and the need to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

A progressive democratic state is the prerequisite for pushing such a program. 

A Sustainable Reconstruction program must be based on recognition that the efficient use of limited material resources will require a shift away from competitive consumption (with its increasingly unequal distribution of wealth) and towards meeting most  needs with public goods that engender strong engagement, starting at the community level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the Saudis have so far refused to curb production to prop up prices. Its not clear yet how far OPEC is willing to let prices slide. The U.A.E.s energy minister said on Dec. 14 that OPEC wouldnt trim production even if prices fall to $40 a barrel.

I find it interesting to consider how long-term limits on fossil fuel production, to forestall the worst ravages of climate change, provide a context for understanding Saudi Arabia's  decision to let the market sink in a flood of cheap product.  I hope that the Saudi action may provide the kind of disruption that allows for fresh thinking, and a post-crisis re-configuration of the energy market.

The Saudis seem committed to continue producing full-tilt, as long as their low-cost supply lasts.

I think that one motive for the Saudis' market decision may be as a response to their increasing certainty that restrictions on carbon emissions will come.

High energy prices have been based on Saudi self-restraint, limiting supply in order to keep prices high. That has reduced Saudi market share, but that loss has been more than compensated by increased economic rent per barrel (i.e. market price minus production cost).

The Saudis may understand that they are now in a "use it, or lose it" situation with respect to oil as an economic resource.  Expanding their market share,  despite the immediate impact on price, then becomes a rational profit-maximizing strategy.

The current low price is not the end of the story.  Current high-cost producers will not re-invest as their existing wells are depleted.  That will eliminate the current glut, stabilizing oil prices.  As demand increases, more expensive oil will be tapped, and the price will rise again, but Saudi existing capacity, at that higher price, will be the first to fill that higher demand.  That is because their cost for expanding production will, in general, be less than the cost of developing new production elsewhere.

Thus the Saudi play to crash oil prices should inhibit new investment in the development of expensive unconventional fossil fuel for a long time to come.  Even when prices rebound somewhat, projected future prices will have been ratcheted down, because Saudi forbearance can no longer be expected.

This speaks directly to the business case for divestment in fossil fuel companies.

Here's a few recent articles along this line of thinking:

  Does Keystone XL make sense as oil prices fall?
  http://m.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy-Voices/2015/0116/Does-Keystone-XL-make-sense-as-oil-prices-fall#unhide

  Stanford faculty members call for fossil fuel divestment - full letter
  (Letter signed by 295 faculty members calls on US university to pull out of all fossil fuel investments)
  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2015/jan/11/stanford-fossil-fuel-divestment-letter

  Axa IM warns that companies linked to fossil fuels risk their reputations: Climate risk is becoming `synonymous with reputation risk' as a growing fossil fuel divestment movement gains traction with investors around the world, says major European investor Axa IM
  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/15/axa-warns-companies-linked-fossil-fuel-risk-reputations

So the question becomes: what is the business case for investment in a sustainable future when the immediate (and unsustainable) price of fossil fuels is so low?

The perspective of investors must shift from quick returns, which sharply discount future consequences.  That mode of thinking is consonant with high interest rates.  Those high rates embody the implicit assumption that the future will take care of itself:  there will be enough growth to pay off any adverse consequences arising from current activities.

That perspective has been dead since the dotcom bust of 1999.  Attempts at re-floating investor confidence have kindled property bubbles, even in China.

It's time for the mass of world capital to wake up to its new task: preparing the planet for people to live successfully within material limits.  It is a huge task.  Failure by the political class to do its part in securing the path forward makes investment riskier.  But keeping blinders on is not a rational alternative.  If the Saudis can face a carbon-constrained future, so can other investors, once they see that there is no other alternative.  If the current managers of capital cannot credibly manage that capital, then that role will be forfeited by them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> RWV is a model for diligent advocacy work. Open the attachment to see the level of specificity needed to effectively advocate for patients under ACA.  The same level of scrutiny and sensitivity to the effect of rules on people would be needed even if Single Payer were in effect.  Without ACA or another comprehensive government program, like Single Payer, the issues raised by RWV would still exist, but there would be no place to turn to address those issues.  The free market, by itself,   cannot resolve this level of complexity efficiently.  That is because we, as consumers, are often presented with major health need decisions which must be made without "shopping" -- i.e., we are perishable, and can't wait for full information.  That is why the provision of vital health services is inherently a public good, and why a well-informed and active civil society is critical in making any public service work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is the Saudi strategic agenda in crashing the price of oil? As the low-cost producer they will survive and continue to pump out their reserve, while undercutting all of their geopolitical rivals as well as economic competitors -- principally Iran and Russia. They will make fracking, deepwater, and tar sand extraction bad investments, not only immediately, but even after the price goes back up, because SA has demonstrated its power to impose disastrous risk on these high-cost operations. But there is a deeper strategy that I believe may be operating as well. If the world's major powers -- China, EU, and eventually the U.S. -- recognize that earthbound carbon must remain sequestered in the ground, then there is no value for SA in holding its reserves in reserve for future use, say, post 2050. They have a direct interest in spewing it forth while there's still a market, even at a discount price. And once they've broken the unconventional extraction industry, the price can go back up without eliciting new supplies -- a win-win for the Saudis. For long-term economic as well as environmental stability, this is the time to impose a carbon tax. It would keep energy prices at a level that people and businesses are used to paying, and provide the funds needed to build out the new economy that must replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, and meet a myriad of other resource constraints that cannot be efficiently addressed by market forces alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The police have an impossible job defending the property and consciences of the protected class (most of us -- more than the 1% who are inexorably taking all of our marbles, but definitely excluding those whose communities are already dispossessed of hope).  The cops job is to quarantine the unpleasant dysfunctional reality of the resulting contagious social disease.  And they become infected.  The mindset of an occupying army becomes more brutalized over time, because the underlying conditions do not go away.  And, increasingly, their actions shock the conscience of those who they are actually trying to protect. Some of us even denounce the police, say "not in our name".  But that will remain a hypocritical protest until we, the protected, turn our guilty consciences into changing what we want.  Subjugation and oppression work for a while. Simon Legree whipped slaves to death to serve as an example -- to instill terror. But that kind of "law and order" is not sustainable. It is bringing the endless war home, and only one thing is certain: no one will win. A libertarian vision must finally understand that the unconditional defense of property under conditions of injustice creates the police state that threatens all of us.   So, what to do? Only attending to all the cries can rest the vengeful urge in mourning's peace. Repeat in your own words what the other is saying, until you understand it.

 The concept gaining traction from Wall Street to the City of London is simple. Limits on emissions of carbon dioxide will be necessary to hold temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius, the maximum climate scientists say is advisable. Without technologies to capture the waste gases from combusting fossil fuels, a majority of known oil, gas and coal deposits would have to stay underground. Once that point is reached, they become stranded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe that the rejection of the reality of climate change, and the fetishizing of fossil fuel production as the elixir for American world power, have even deeper roots than discussed by Klare in his analysis documenting the connection between the fossil fuel industry and the Republican Party.
Rational energy companies are hedging their bets. See: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/business/energy-environment/nrg-sets-goals-to-cut-carbon-emissions.html
They recognize the growing divestment movement. See: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/us/harvard-students-move-fossil-fuel-divestment-fight-to-court.html
On the other hand, Republican obstruction asserts a story that its base supporters want to hear to reassure them that American power will be restored, fulfilling their thwarted American dreams.
Many Americans, not only Republicans, now anticipate that their children will do worse than they have. They do not see how the stagnating standard of living of the lower 90% can even be sustained.
Unless it is supported by real production, the American standard of living is, indeed, not sustainable.  The American Way of Life can be maintained only temporarily, through the use of our previously accumulated wealth and power, which we are currently expending to support consumption greater than the value of what we produce.
The fearful majority, who propelled the Republicans' recent election victory, understand that the U.S. still remains an attractive place to make a living.  But what does America produce that cannot be produced elsewhere cheaper? Primarily (1) stuff that must be made or done here to be sold here, in this still rich country -- retail, houses, hands-on healthcare, etc.;  (2) resource-based industries -- principally agriculture and fossil fuel production; (3) the military-industrial complex, whose costs have become too expensive to bear as America's overall economic body weakens; (4) high-end technology, which quickly gets manufactured elsewhere (iPhone, etc.);  and (5) financial and managerial services, which have been growing as the real economy stagnates, propped up by the dollar as the prime global currency.
American military power is key to keeping superpower privilege intact. Why else should capital markets, and the lucrative financial services industry they support, remain based here, even as the center of gravity for global economic activity moves east to Asia?
Now added to this mix are the shale oil and fracking boom, which are being sold as the fountain of revitalization for manufacturing.
So the policy contest on this issue is heating up, and is not going away.  On the one side is the need to confront the emerging climate disaster revealed by science, in a world increasingly beyond the grasp of American control.  On the other side is a deep ideology that believes in American exceptionalism, and must increasingly deny reality in order to keep its confidence up.
Delusions of grandeur --belief in a divine right to continued dominance -- are the hardest of illusions to break.
The world has limited resources, and limited ability of the environment to absorb the unconsumable byproducts of production (global warming is just one aspect of this).
Reality presents threatening questions, and the political class offers no real answers.
As of yet, no one on the political stage is pointing our attention towards a modest but humanly acceptable future.
It's time to call for a new script and new players on stage to surprise and awaken us back to living the possible life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Protecting victims of crime and human trafficking as well as workers. The Department of Labor (DOL) is expanding and strengthening immigration options for victims of crimes (U visas) and trafficking (T visas) who cooperate in government investigations.  An interagency working group will also explore ways to ensure that workers can avail themselves of their labor and employment rights without fear of retaliation.

This policy can be aggressively used to reduce illegal immigration in the future.  It appears to allow undocumented workers who have been the victim of crimes by their employers, such as wage theft, to turn to the legal system for redress, and for the first time be eligible for "immigration options for victims of crimes" which should protect them from deportation. </TEXT>

Both have spoken and mobilized.  But for a movement of change to be real, it must have its own life, outside the grasp of "leaders".  Otherwise existing power will always make deals with those leaders: " Dismantle the movement and we the powerful will address your issues."  But the price is to never change power relations: who rules.  In this process, corruption of the leader is inevitable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A mindset in need of an intervention. Israel may wish to be Isis. But it is not. Even it's nuclear might is insufficient to exterminate its enemies. Time is not on it's side. Kill And Be Killed doesn't work. The alternative is to repair the damage, do what is just, and starve the fires of destructive rage by removing the fuel. That is a long term task. Israel will deserve everyone's support, including Palestinians, if it chooses the prophetic path to peace. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If both Israel and Palestine seat their core identities in an unresolvable contradiction, the winner will not have enough blood left to survive.  To unlock the deadly embrace, Palestinians must be released to a life of real prospects -- morally as well as materially -- i.e., into conditions which transcend revenge.  What must Israel become, in what kind of world, to make this possible? What would resolve the contradiction is a post-Israeli/Palestinian identity which is not yet on anyone's horizon.  An identity against both Jewish and Islamic Statism because they potentiate each other and are a mortal peril for us all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Israel must learn the lesson from the 2006 deadlock with Hezbollah, and the survival of Hamas in Gaza.  If sovereignty requires a monopoly of power, then Israel cannot secure its state.  After 2006 we should recognize that Israel has lost its full spectrum dominance. The use of force now becomes increasingly costly as it proves itself to be ineffectual. Greater than the material cost is the deplenishment of its moral capital.  Israel cannot live in this world if it has bankrupted its account of goodwill. Like every country, Israel must live within the limits of its power, even if that power cannot guarantee its total security. The goal has to shift to accommodation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My comment to the FCC: The internet -- the information superhighway -- must be open to all users at the same speed.  We understand that the infrastructure that is the medium of telecommunication must be paid for.  But users already pay their internet service provider.  ISPs form a network that must be integrated, like the electrical grid. Final distribution to users is often a monopoly, and therefore must be regulated as a utility.  No benefit is served by establishing a regime where monopolistic carriers of data can establish discriminatory conditions as to price or speed of service.  A proper regulatory structure is needed to assure that overall system capacity is sufficient to provide the level of service that people are paying for.
I urge you to use your Title II authority, to declare that internet providers  are common carriers, who cannot prioritize who gets served and who gets stranded..

The deeper problem is the functioning of the body politic that is, at an increasing rate, excreting the homeless as its waste product.  Our economic system is focused on eliminating waste to maximize profits (labeled "staying competitive").  No one has the job of seeing what people need, and producing it, if they don't have money.

	<TEXT> Nursegate.  Christie's (and Cuomo's) fear play has boomeranged.  Hysteria in power leads to the use of excessive force.  States have the inherent police power to quarantine anyone who is a threat to public health.  But that is not a license to round up people and detain them on vague suspicion.  That's not due process.  That is an appeal to mass fear.  What is needed is a public health system capable of identifying people at risk, and then providing close surveillance and management of each case.  That costs public money -- i.e., tax money -- and politicians avoid that like the plague.

	<TEXT> This approach, which bypasses climate change as the rationale for carbon pricing, would take us a long way towards establishing the architecture of incentives needed to switch into a low carbon-emissions economy.  More is needed.  An even higher price for carbon, over time, would require explicit acknowledgement that this it is being done to combat climate change.  And more will have to be done beyond the capacity of the market to handle -- regulatory and policy frameworks that support our move towards a sustainable relationship between the planet and its peoples.  Carbon pricing is necessary, and it is a good place to start acting locally, even before we understand how to think globally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the 19th Century, when the germ theory replaced the sin theory as the explanation for disease, there was a revolution in the public sphere, where respectable people understood the need to not let the poor become the vectors for the spread of disease to the more fortunate classes. Public health, starting with a safe water supply, became a major government responsibility, for which people were willing to pay taxes, and even have some of their property rights regulated. Over the last forty years or so that awareness has gotten lost. That's when homelessness in the U.S. went from a rarity to an ever-present population who most of us avert our eyes from seeing. And now that vast unseen population of vulnerable people may subvert any possibility of tracking and containing deadly infectious diseases like ebola. The moral foundations of human decency are, in fact, practical. We are responsible for the long run consequences of our actions. If we fail to give a damn, here and now, the conditions which support our daily lives will disappear. Public health -- your health -- cannot be maintained when other people fall below the minimum standards for healthy living. And, with ebola, we see that that principle applies globally.

Of course, China can bring in troops from the provinces to crush any local population.  But mass repression is not stability -- witness Syria.

	<TEXT> thoughts from a disposable man, and health policy maker

  My father illustrates the situation well. About a decade ago, just shy of his 77th birthday, he began having pain in his abdomen. Like every good doctor, he kept denying that it was anything important. But after three weeks with no improvement, he was persuaded to see his physician. He had in fact had a heart attack, which led to a cardiac catheterization and ultimately a bypass. Since then, he has not been the same. Once the prototype of a hyperactive Emanuel, suddenly his walking, his talking, his humor got slower. Today he can swim, read the newspaper, needle his kids on the phone, and still live with my mother in their own house. But everything seems sluggish. Although he didnt die from the heart attack, no one would say he is living a vibrant life. When he discussed it with me, my father said, I have slowed down tremendously. That is a fact. I no longer make rounds at the hospital or teach. Despite this, he also said he was happy.
As Crimmins puts it, over the past 50 years, health care hasnt slowed the aging process so much as it has slowed the dying process. And, as my father demonstrates, the contemporary dying process has been elongated.  </TEXT>

China's utopian quest for stability without democracy is doomed to fail because self-correcting systems need broad-based input.  The Party is not big enough to see the whole picture unless everyone is included.  Democracy needs active participating citizens who share enough common goals so that they want to live and work together.  Hong Kong's struggle shows the process by which a people is created which is capable of ruling itself well.  Joshua Wong has struck the moral bell, and the resonance has activated a people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am for Single Payer because I believe that basic health care is a human right that should be paid for out of tax dollars.  And I believe that taxes should be based on ability to pay.  But that only starts to answer the question of how well the service is provided.  Conscious participation by the stakeholders is required to make anything work well.  If people don't take care of themselves, the results will turn out badly, no matter what the system.  As far as the point you raise about lack of medical practitioners, I think the best remedy is to make medical education, like military training, a cost we bear collectively.  Train the number we need so that there won't be a shortage, and pay people what we need to pay to keep the supply stable.  Medicine should not be run as a self-protective guild. High incomes (and similar high returns to Big Pharma, etc.) reflect market failure to provide sufficient supply to drive down prices.  Good policy can correct that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Affordable Care Act is built on a pathological private insurance system that cuts costs by minimizing its coverage of vital medical services. Insurance systems need to be big enough to spread the risk. In most places that means that there are only a few choices, and, therefore, people who need insurance have no bargaining power. A single-payer national health program would change that equation. It would be, at least conceptually, possible to rein in costs and provide decent medical service. For such a system to work well, however, civil society will have to be a lot healthier. The electorate will have to be attentive and interested in holding those elected officials responsible for the consequences of their policies. The deeper disease is the cynicism that most people feel about their power to act together and make a difference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The rule of law is what allows people, and business, to form rational expectations for planning and decision-making.  The market cannot work without a set of rules (not necessarily fixed, but also not arbitrary and volatile).  The law itself must evolve with conditions.  That's why democracy is a pre-condition for the effective rule of law.  The democratic idea takes as a given that there is no all-knowing authority -- that governance must constantly correct its course.  It is the way that conflict can be minimized, and real change achieved voluntarily, without coercion.  It is a process, best played out by people who have similar values and are roughly equal in power.  If the people of Hong Kong can hold themselves together to win democratic rule,  all China will benefit, because it will inevitably follow Hong Kong's path. </TEXT>

Syria-Iraq is only the starting point of the Caliphate.  Jordan, the Arabian peninsula, and Egypt all have regimes which embrace Western materialism while concentrating those goodies of capitalism in the hands of the few.  Totalitarian Islam is a populist response to the failure of modernization to make the lives of most people desirable.  The Arab Spring was the last great hope. The Egyptian military never lost power, and Morsi failed to reach out beyond the Moslem Brotherhood's small business and rural base.

	<TEXT> This can be a turning point -- when the cowardice and conventional wisdom of those holding "fiduciary responsibility" shifts from opposing divestment, to supporting it.  The old CYA default mode position is represented by Harvard:

 Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvards president, has issued statements that she and her colleagues do not believe that divestment is warranted or wise, and argued that the schools $32.7 billion endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.

But that is directly challenged by the RBF divestment:

 Steven Rockefeller, a son of Nelson A. Rockefeller and a trustee of the fund, said that he foresees financial problems ahead for companies that have stockpiled more reserves than they can burn without contributing significantly to climate damage. "We see this as having both a moral and economic dimension," he said.

The whole objective of CYA is to avoid taking responsibility.  With RBF's logic to respond to,  Harvard's cover has been pulled.  Does Harvard et. al. join the climate change deniers, or does it admit that climate change makes a difference, and act accordingly?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of the three cable news network stories, Fox is the most surprising. Most of Fox's story is about how the climate issue does not interest the American people. But they not only gave the crowd estimate, 310,000, they explained how it was derived:

 To calculate the attendance, organizers used a crowd density analysis formula developed by a professor of game theory and complex systems at Carnegie Mellon University. The formula calculated average crowd density over specific intervals, factoring in the surface area covered by the crowd and the speed and duration of the march.

The crowd estimate (which was three times what the organizers had expected) was believable because the organizers had the courage to let the estimate be generated by an objective method -- not their own wishful thinking. And I want to give credit to Fox News, which had the honesty to report that number, despite the fact that it totally contradicts their spin. Something is, in fact, happening. I was there. It was a great experience, filled with good spirit and energy.  People left that march with determination to stay connected, and have an impact.

	<TEXT> The non-violent revolution against Assad was lost when it failed to expand its base of support to include Alawites and other minorities.  This is not a criticism, but an unfortunate reality. The result was that the Alawite-dominated military did not desert Assad, but has brutally crushed Sunnis and other opponents of the regime. ISIS opportunistically has stepped in, attacking other opponents of Assad far from the front line of conflict.  And now that the Sunni reaction has spread to Iraq, to Mosul and beyond, panic has set in.  Everyone agrees that "there is no military solution".  But it is only the military dimension that will get done by the U.S. and its satellite nations.  The alternative route is to forebear military responses, and renounce the entire objective of maintaining Western power in the region.  The wealthy countries can provide resources so that local peoples are able to develop their own self-defense strategies.  The goals that are worth promoting would minimize violence, and make coercive occupation too expensive to sustain.  All countries should be opening their borders for resettling refugees.  ISIS would then find that it has captured only itself.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zephyr Teachout's concession speech was really a victory speech.  She demonstrated that principled, issue-driven politics can go on the offensive, and come remarkably close to beating money and intimidation.  Zephyr gave special tribute to her campaign manager, Mike Boland, who left the Working Families Party after it sold its soul to keep its ballot access.  Cuomo has shown only contempt for the WFP.  The larger lesson is that cynical "realistic" politics mobilizes zero enthusiasm.  Established institutional politics responds to incentives that quickly degenerate into bribery.  The fighting spirit of the Teachout campaign is the only hope for progressive values to survive.  It is the evidence that people can self-organize, with very little money.  And maybe, one day, they'll win.

But unless they are organized, and operate in a legal framework which supports collective bargaining, they will be too weak and atomized to maximize their advantage.  That's why unions and labor-based political parties have been necessary to counter capitalism's tendency to extract ever higher proportions of the value of production. </TEXT>

What is the effect on the proliferation of for-hire vehicles, which would be a traffic disaster in Central Business Districts like the Manhattan Core?  If Uber takes enough business away from licensed cabs, and of public transit, they may lose economic viability.  Cutbacks in those services would make access almost impossible in dense areas.  If Uber can pay for all of the adverse consequences for which it is responsible, then it would have to have deep pockets indeed!

	<TEXT> Take the time to read Adam Shatz' long article on reporting the Middle East.  It is the very point of Shatz's evolution (as a person of the left who values intellectual integrity) that he offers no resolution, no new movement to support whose program and analysis would lead us onto a hopeful path forward.  Shatz is a man who knows what is right, and would like that right to prevail.  But he has no faith that struggle against an immediate oppression builds the momentum that would take us to a fuller liberation. After every victory is a confusing moral subsidence.  His loss of faith in the future comes from his vast experience and openness.  He is fully embedded in the complex.  It is a painful place to be, without a path forward to counter depression, as civilized aspirations appear increasingly quaint.
I do not disagree with Shatz analytically.  But my own need for an anti-depressant raison d-etre requires the possibility that people, sharing the same despair, find solace in common cause.  I hope that others come to share and act according to my faith and identity, which are universalistic.  However unlikely it is that a sustainable humane future can emerge in a world filled with lesser and contending identities, I know that I have to make the case for that whole vision -- not just root for the good guys in particular struggles. The greatest threat, from my point of view, is to succumb to inertia, not bothering to fight for the unlikely.
So I plan to join the Peoples Climate March on September 21 in Manhattan.  Not because it will work, but because I am still here. And quaint is the only hope we have.

	<TEXT> Every non-military Gazan injured or killed by Israel, and every non-military Israeli injured or killed by Hamas is potentially the victim of a war crime.  Each attack deserves an impartial international investigation.  Hamas does not claim to avoid civilian casualties.  Its criminal culpability is therefore self-evident.  Israel claims to have made heroic efforts to avoid civilian casualties.  Surely it must have the ability to document its pretensions.  If it fails to show what justified its actions in each case, then it too, like Hamas, must be deemed guilty of war crimes, and must to be held accountable by the world community. </TEXT>

 Ken Hughes ... has worked on the Nixon tapes since 2000 as part of the ambitious Presidential Recordings Program at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. His "Chasing Shadows," the best account yet of Nixon's devious interference with Lyndon Johnson's 1968 Vietnam War negotiations, shows just how early Nixon's dirty tricks began and just how deeply he was involved... Hughes establishes that as soon as Nixon came into office, he knew he had a big secret to hide. Hughes then shows how this secret contributed to Watergate...

To organize an indigenous Resistance movement, you need to offer a political program -- a future -- that is worth taking risks and fighting for.  That is a slow and risky process, but, if successful, it would create a powerful support for a democratic Ukraine, embracing all its regions.  The alternative, chosen by the Ukrainian government, is typical of the imperial game played in this region forever.  Bitter indignation at the shabby treatment of Donetsk civilians will be the basis for a contentious future.

	<TEXT> Netanyahu's problem is that perpetual war achieves no long-term objective.  The current exercise of "mowing the lawn" -- destroying enough Palestinian lives and property to get submission right now -- only creates a more punishment-resistant strain of Palestinian politics.  If Hamas survives, so will its capacity to launch rockets.  If Hamas is eliminated, ISIS will fill the vacuum. And actual genocide of Palestinians is a policy which is a reactionary utopia.  The Palestinian diaspora and the Arab and Muslim world cannot be eliminated, and they will not always be powerless to inflict revenge -- even on innocent Israelis who oppose the madness of perpetual aggression.  Actions have consequences.  The first step in the right direction is to change direction.  Open Gaza's supply lines to the world, let people come and go.  And take responsibility for the damage that has been done.  Hamas should pay reparations for all of the collateral damage it has done to Israelis, and Israel should pay for all of the collateral damage done to Palestinians.  Let's start by assuming that an Israeli life and a Palestinian life are of equal value.  How much is a life worth? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tunnels can be stopped on Israel's side of the border. But of course, that would be unacceptable -- Netanyahu would have to use some of Israel's sacred territory, opening him up to the charge that "the terrorists have won".
Tunnels can also be used to hide rockets, or to get supplies from Egypt.  The only way to eliminate those tunnels is for Israel to fully occupy Gaza and remove the entire population while Israel searches and destroys.
The problem for Israel is that this effective response is exhorbitantly costly in Israeli lives and continuous occupation.  Genocide would be cheaper, but would also impose political costs, like bringing Rand Paul into office in the U.S., ending the gravy train.
So all this is for show.  
Hamas has the long-term advantage that Israel's impotent display of ruthless aggression will weaken Israel over time, while the world will owe a moral debt to the remnant of surviving Palestinians, just as the world owed a moral debt to the Jews for not having prevented the Holocaust. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The job of a democratic state is to protect the right of peaceful assembly so that people can express their views, and to protect citizens against attack from any side.  Banning demonstrations which do not call for violence is preemptive and illegitimate use of state power.  It reveals the character of a state: that it would rather repress its non-violent dissident citizens than limit itself to restraining people whose acts are in fact criminal.  Once a state acts preemptively, even thoughts which "challenge order" become punishable offenses.  The Police State mentality has a logic which can be found almost everywhere.  Like all paranoids, its fear-driven acts create the resistance it only imagines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The key question Colvin asks is: What will people do better than computers?
Colvin's jobs for the future appear to be mainly for the leaders:

   Consider the skills in highest demand over the next five to 10 years as specified by employers in a recent survey by Towers Watson and Oxford Economics. Those skills didn't include business acumen, analysis, or P L management. Instead, relationship building, teaming, co-creativity, cultural sensitivity, and managing diverse employees were all near the top....

   Building the skills of human interaction, embracing our most essentially human traits, will play to some people's strengths and make others deeply uncomfortable. Those people will be in trouble.

Unfortunately, that description has only one group securely employed -- Fortune's readers, many of whom, I suspect, are managers hoping to rise up the ladder to leadership.

The more troubling question is not discussed.  What happens to most people, who are becoming economically unnecessary? Capitalism is a system designed to reward winners. Losers are a "social problem".  To the extent that the society rejects social answers to social problems, we are in trouble. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course, it is not only the Israeli regime that is trying its damnedest to torpedo a reasonable accommodation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.  The kidnapping and murder of the settler kids was designed to heighten the brutality of Israeli repression, thereby forcing the Hamas leadership back into the rejectionist camp. Hamas did not have the courage to denounce that crime.  They were stuck with their traditional line that in the fight for liberation, all settlers are fair targets.  That is the politics of endless war.  And it is the fuel that the Israeli regime needed to whip up national unity to re-open "pinpoint" attacks against Hamas "militants".  And there we go again.  Israel aggression could not remain unanswered. Off go the rockets, and the escalation follows.  The question then becomes: How low in the moral order, how high in the ranks of pariah states, is the breaking point for Israel due to the growing revulsion -- both internally and internationally.  Can a burgeoning Israeli culture of sadism (pleasure in inflicting pain) smash the humanist impulse? Israel cannot win this fight. 
There is no Final Solution that Israel can impose on the Palestinian people and on the wider Arab and Muslim world.  The only alternative to extermination of an enemy is accommodation.  
I believe that Israel must demonstrate forbearance unilaterally, even if the rockets continue to be launched. That at least offers the hope of escaping the vortex of death, in which Gaza will not be the only death camp. The United States can help those in Israel who wish to move out of the death trap.  As an American Jew myself, I ask my country to cast its lot for peace, and take the first step itself.  
We must ask: what concrete steps must the U.S. take to show that it does not follow along in support of Israel's pathological path. 
And, of course, I also call for Hamas to unilaterally halt its rocket attacks.  Rockets and terrorism will not stop continued Israeli oppression and expansion.  Making Israel morally worse only deepens the trap for all.
But Palestinians need to know that the world gives a damn about their slow relentless strangulation as a people.
Perhaps the hardest task for us here in America is to not avert our eyes and attention, just because it is all so awful. </TEXT>

Or we could decide to do better.  If we stop thinking of the world's poor kids as excess baggage -- garbage to be disposed of elsewhere -- then we have a different class of problems -- a big moral dilemma, but one that is worthy of addressing.
Without moral ambition, what do we become, and why do we deserve our good fortune?

	<TEXT> In a 2003 memoir, Fighting Injustice, Michael E. Tigar, the lawyer who represented Mr. Truong at his trial, described the prosecution as part of a political backlash against opponents of the war.

Unrepentant for its errors in Vietnam, he wrote, the government turned against those who had opposed its policies. Rather than opening debate about matters affecting national security, it invoked draconian laws to maintain the wall of secrecy.

Mr. Truongs sister said in a phone interview on Thursday that her brother took a more pragmatic view of the case.

He saw it as a political case, and himself as a very small piece in the game that countries play when they want to achieve their political goals, she said. In that game, she added, her brother understood that we are all expendable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are some things you should know about the proposed rule:  
On June 2, 2014 EPA proposed its Clean Power Plan which establishes state-based targets for reducing carbon pollution from existing power plants, under Clean Air Act Section 111(d).  Under the plan, carbon emissions will be reduced from 2005 levels by 30% by 2030. Also by 2030, the plan would reduce by over 25% pollutants that contribute to the soot and smog that make people sick. 
EPA considered four Building Blocks, or areas of opportunity, to determine reasonable emissions targets for each state.  In determining feasible cost-effective goals, EPA identified best practices already being done for these contributing factors.  
Targets were then set using (1) a consistent national formula, and (2) state- and regional-specific information.  When taken as a whole, state-by-state targeted emissions meet the overall national goal.
Each state can either follow EPA's "Best System of Emission Reduction" path to meet its target, or it can design its own program to achieve that target. The plan establishes interim and final goals.  States will have flexibility in their rate of program implementation during the 2020-2029 period. They will only be required to achieve a cumulative emissions goal over that whole period.  Thus, states that start slowly will need to have a more aggressive slope of implementation in the later years. 
Building Block elements included to determine the BSER target for each state are:
1. Make fossil fuel-fired power plants more efficient.  The target deemed feasible is a 6% reduction in emissions rates (the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of electricity) from coal-fired plants.  (The significance of this factor in determining a state's target depends on the proportion of power plants fired by coal in that state.) 
2. Expand use of lower-emitting sources as a proportion of the electric power dispatched over the grid. This entails increased utilization of existing (i.e., already operating) electric generating units such as natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants.  EPA assumes that a capacity utilization of NGCC plants of up to 70% can be achieved.
3.  Build more zero/low-emitting energy sources.  EPA's targets for renewable power recognize that states start at different places.  States with a low level of renewable power are assumed to have the opportunity to increase their proportion of renewable power generation, up to the average level prevailing in their region.  
4. Use electricity more efficiently.  Energy efficiency goals are expressed in terms of an annual rate of improvement.  The rate of improvement can be ramped up over time (in EPA's plan, by an increment of 0.15% per year) so that by 2030 all states achieve an annual rate of improvement of electricity use of at least 1.5% (some states are already improving their energy efficiency at a faster rate).
Individual and multi-state plans are due June 30, 2016.
The proposed rule, as well as information about how to comment and supporting technical information, are available online at: http://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan
EPA will hold four public hearings during the week of July 28th in Denver, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.
There will be a 120-day public comment period on the proposal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congress needs to weigh in on any decision to start bombing Iraq once again. Your Congress member should sign onto the Scott Rigell-Barbara Lee letter, saying the President must come to Congress for authorization before taking military action in Iraq.

Iraq will not turn out the way we desired.  All we can do now is to not make things worse. Any U.S. re-engagement in Iraq would sink the possibility that Iraqis will find a way out of the current crisis.

The politicians who we have backed do not have the confidence of the Iraqi people.  That is why this regime is  losing the country to a vicious opponent.

Further American support for this regime will lead to an uncontrollable civil war.

What is needed is a national unity government that Iraqis are willing to fight for.  It must include Sunnis, Kurds, and Shias who are not corrupt.

An honest Iraqi unity government will not want to be tarnished by association with the U.S.  That is the legacy of our previous actions.

It is better to save lives and recognize the defeat of the American intervention in Iraq than to deny reality in an attempt to save face. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Krugman is right about the deniers of climate change who do so because addressing it would contradict their laissez faire ideology. But an even more serious threat to effective action is the ideology of mainstream economists who do not deny climate change, but think that we should just grow the economy, and then we'll be better able to afford any mitigation effort that might be required. The problem with this approach is that commodified wealth, valued in money, is treated as a universal metric -- for wealth to count it must have a market value. But it is a fallacy that if you have enough wealth, you can buy anything, including mitigation and adaptation for climate change. That disregards every form of wealth that cannot be bought and sold. Degrading natural wealth in the service of commodified wealth is how we got to the fix we're in -- not only on climate, but in many other dimensions. Mobilizing resources to fight climate change is not a market function. It is a global and governmental function. It requires making the transition from following the agenda of private accumulation to that of meeting common needs.
How real is the Obama administration's commitment to effective action? The Keystone XL decision will be a strong test. Stopping KXL only makes sense if we push on from there to a global strategy that sets a rapidly declining cap for carbon emissions. But if KXL is not stopped, the business-as-usual juggernaut will roll on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the comment I wrote to Harvard, along with my signature:
Meet with Divest Harvard's students as soon as possible to discuss the Harvard Corporation's divestment from fossil fuel corporations.

Investment in the fossil fuel industry is a bad choice for Harvard, on strictly economic terms.  See Nicholas Stern's report, Unburnable carbon 2013: Wasted capital and stranded assets  http://www.carbontracker.org/wastedcapital

Our last hope for averting disastrous climate change depends on drawing a line that contains in place a large portion of the world's remaining (and deeply sequestered) fossil fuels. If we are serious about changing course, investments in the fossil fuel industry make no sense. The necessary restriction on carbon use over the life of expensive new investments, like the Keystone XL pipeline, means that the anticipated fossil fuel product that justify these investments will not be realized.  Expensive fossil fuel production -- the kind that is still left to invest in -- will not be able to compete economically against other cheaper sources that are already developed, that will fill the quota of allowable carbon emissions.  And the price for existing reserves already reflects their value. There is no bonanza left for Harvard to tap. 

When new investments like KXL fail, who will pay the cost of decommissioning the pipeline and restoring the environment?  Corporations (and their hapless investors) will bear their share of the liability, and the rest will fall on taxpayers, leaving an unknown amount of residual damage to be borne directly by the environment and the public.

Of course, it would be wonderful news if you can prove that climate change is not a problem. But if it is, and we have to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions globally, then the cornucopian promise of an abundant fossil fuel supply only makes the global political task more difficult. If we fail to act to protect this world's climate, we will reap the whirlwind.  Then there is no predicting the risks to our social and economic order.  In a world where Cambridge is inundated by the angry rising sea, Harvard will have no Plan B.

Harvard should know what it is doing.  It has a choice to make.  Which side are you on?

Maidan demonstrators were calling for an end to a corrupt oligarch-controlled state.  But, the Maidan demonstrators lacked an understanding of the dangers of neo-liberal austerity, which the EU would like to impose (as has been done in Greece, Portugal, and Spain).  Fighting domination by both the EU and by Russia would have been a tough agenda, but the basis for building a united people.  Sadly, the political class of Ukraine was not ready to present such a bold program.  The result is a no-win situation for the Ukrainian people.

However, if your intention is to ameliorate climate change,  support for the pipeline makes no sense.  The cost of basic extraction and processing makes that tar uneconomic to bring to market.

We need to sharply reduce carbon emissions. KXL is just a line we must not cross, where we must say Stop, because stopping it means that we are serious about preventing business-as-usual uncapped carbon emissions. Indeed, stopping KXL only makes sense if we push on from there to a global strategy that sets a rapidly declining cap for carbon emissions. In that scenario (the only outcome where the planet is rescued and lives are saved) tar sands oil will be far too expensive to use (the limited carbon cap will be filled by cheaper conventional sources), and any pipeline to get tar sands oil to market will be a stranded asset -- i.e., a disastrous investment. If KXL is stopped, it is because we mean business. If not, the business-as-usual juggernaut will roll on without regard to climate change, and the disastrous consequences it portends. </TEXT>

Soybeans have been a boon to Brazils economy, and global demand is growing. Under intense pressure from agricultural interests, Brazils Chamber of Deputies approved legislation in July 2012 that rolled back many provisions of the 1965 Forest Code, reduced the amount of reserve areas in the Amazon and gave amnesty to past violators. To her credit, Brazils president, Dilma Rousseff, thwarted some of the most damaging provisions of the new legislation, but the rate of deforestation still rose.

The struggle to control GHG emissions must be global, but that means overcoming special interests in every country, without having a guarantee that responsible policies will be followed in other countries.  What is needed are strong global incentives to do the right thing.  Until that happens, active citizen participation will be needed everywhere, thinking globally and acting locally.  To be successful, such movements need international solidarity.  It's hard to mount a campaign if you think your cause is right, but your efforts are going to prove futile.  Those who oppose Keystone XL in North America must see those trying to protect the Amazon rain forest as companions in the same struggle.  We need each other. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difficult choice to keep costs down entailed restriction of choice of doctors and hospitals.  This reflects the problem of ACA's architecture, dependent on insurance companies -- a fault that could be remedied by a well-designed Single Payer system, where choice can be maintained, and the real cost of care reimbursed.  From the article:

 In an unusual decision that had a strong impact on consumer choices, New York required insurers to offer the same type of coverage on the exchange as off. The result was that none of New Yorks insurers offered out-of-network coverage for individuals, except in a small part of western New York, because they wanted to hold down costs and avoid being swamped by sick people. So regardless of whether individuals buy their plans on the exchange or off, they cannot get coverage outside a fixed network of doctors and hospitals, even if they are willing to pay more for it. </TEXT>

KXL is just a line we must not cross, where we must say Stop, because stopping it means that we are serious about preventing business-as-usual uncapped carbon emissions. Indeed, stopping KXL only makes sense if we push on from there to a global strategy that sets a rapidly declining cap for carbon emissions. In that scenario (the only outcome where the planet is rescued and lives are saved) tar sands oil will be far too expensive to use (the limited carbon cap will be filled by cheaper conventional sources), and any pipeline to get tar sands oil to market will be a stranded asset -- i.e., a disastrous investment. If KXL is stopped, it is because we mean business. If not, the business-as-usual juggernaut will roll on without regard to climate change, and the disastrous consequences it portends.

	<TEXT> China's economic development is reaching a point where the costs outweigh the benefits, even for those close to the top of the class pyramid. This trajectory is unsustainable. Living within its environmental limits is not an achievable objective under the present political-economic order. Now that even the leaders are forced to admit the reality, a new path becomes possible. That would require a broad-based democratic consensus about what China should look like. China cannot afford to support billionaires supported by exploited workers who are fleeing rural poverty. Democratically controlled development with a sustainable future in mind is possible, and the only way out of the train wreck that is contemporary China. That is what most people who fought for the Chinese revolution wanted, and have been denied, for 65 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The principle operating here is that corporations are not citizens, and they should not even be allowed to consider taking responsibility for the consequences of their actions.  (On the other hand they can make unlimited political contributions, as long as that does not serve a public purpose).  What have we come to?  Gallagher's mindless doctrine is coming not from the corporations, but from someone appointed by President Obama to protect the well-being of the people.  With such defenders, who needs enemies? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His half-hour speech amounted to a call for overhauling the rules governing proxy access, which some companies argue has been overrun by ideologues putting forth proposals that have no chance of passing and merely make statements about various social or political causes. Such proposals, these companies contend, waste time and ultimately shareholder money. </TEXT>
