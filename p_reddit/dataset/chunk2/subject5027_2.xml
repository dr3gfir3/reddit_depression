	<TEXT> Like I said I want to enjoy it. Like the comment says that's a review from the Guardian. You're in a rush to give it merit here. You can only fast travel to map locations with the double white arrows beside it, and it costs Gil. So you travel to your car. Fast travel. And then drive the rest of the way. I haven't gotten that far before giving up entirely and I noticed the advertisements. If you say more power to developers by sliding down that slope... Well may jebus have mercy on your soul. The camping... At only very limited spaces predetermined ahead of time and did nothing to help break the grind aspect. 
You're entitled to enjoy the game. But people enjoy candy crush. And that shit ain't for me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah this is a great point. Although the guy saying use a sex theme for the next fallout is obviously a fucking retarded asshat. I feel like the reality would be to play whatever music you found and collected in the post apocalyptic world. There'd likely be much less consistency with style and genre. But whatever, a valid point. There's several mods that allow addition of music and full channels. I enjoy adding my own music and it cuts down on soooo much repitition </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Desperately wish I read the Guardians review first at this point 
"If you make it past Cindy, and through the combat system, therell be something else that will get you. Perhaps it will take until the late game, where the open world is ripped away and youre forced through a series of corridors reminiscent of the worst of Final Fantasy XIII; perhaps it will be when you realise how thinly drawn the main characters actually are, living on the level of quips and catchphrases but with little in the way of backstory or motivations.

Perhaps itll be the first time the game drops a plane-load of soldiers on top of you just as youre about to finish a rare hunt, or the first time one of your allies falls off a cliff in a dungeon and runs all the way back to you, training every enemy in the area after them in one long conga-line of death. Perhaps itll be the first time you notice the insane product placement, with adverts for American Express and JapanAir in a world with no America or Japan, and an entire side quest about improving a brand of noodle.

At some point, though, itll happen, and youll realise this is the game you waited a decade for. Your heart will break. Youll move on. Youll finish the story, to see how it ends, but youll stop caring about the side quests quite so much. Youll skip through the voice acting, and just read the wiki pages for the tie-in films (which will finally explain why any of this is actually happening). Youll get to the end, and be glad you did, and be glad its over"

Right now I'm on a mission that's eight minutes drive away. I smoke a whole fucking cigarette to get to most missions and then they end up just grind anyways. But between me and Reddit.

	<TEXT> Yeah there's that screen at the start up... 'A final fantasy for fans and newcomers alike' or whatever. And I'm thinking.... Did they throw in the soundtracks to the previous games to fulfill the obligation to fans??
There's lots to enjoy, like the combat system.... And uh.... That blonde girls tits hanging out of her outfit. But only four characters, unable to name them, all of them boy band rejects... Constant grind missions... The worst travel system I've ever seen... There's just so much wrong it's really begging me to hate it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a philosophy on civilization types. And you indeed have thought of a key aspect of it. It's believed there are a few moments all species would face and the ability to cross one into the other would dictate the likelihood of contact. The manipulation of the fundamental building blocks of nature (the atom and subatomic particles) is the one we are at and it will lead to self destruction or proliferation of a species across space at a previous unheard of rate. Should we survive instead of weaponize this moment we might yet hear from a species who has done the same. They may watch but with a danger like that they're unlikely to want to get too involved. The next civilization stage would be the manipulation of the spacial fabric of time. Fingers crossed lads </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's the sound source, presumably a TV. Have you tried headphones, does this happen with any other games? Hard to tell with such little information but it's possibly a clipping issue or normalization from the TV or a passive limiter set some how. Reset all your TV settings to defaults and game defaults and ensure your system settings don't have any normalization or weird effects on. I'm short with minimal information just do a system wide reset first </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to say it, most games suck and are just rehashed ideas with mild modifications in gameplay or aspects of character control and interaction. Original stories with independent self revolving gameplay is rare. One, maybe two games come out a year that are holding my interest. There's just the way it is now, used to be movies, now it's the game industry. Too much money, not enough story tellers </TEXT>
