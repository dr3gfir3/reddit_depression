Or, as the article hints at, people later in life. Outside of the classroom setting, there's less of an expectation that you be friends with the people you spend lots of time with.

	<TEXT> "The right to dine out in public during the day was an early victory of the women's rights movement at the turn of the 20th century... While women had long visited each other for tea and company in the home, the idea of a woman eating out at a restaurant, unaccompanied by a man, was seen as downright scandalous... (And forget about going out at night: Only women of ill-repute did that.)"

"Taking the luxurious step of brunching at a restaurant eliminated the cleanup that might fall mom's way if, say, the kids decided to make pancakes at home. But even for those women without children, brunch became a sort of public expression of women's lib. As Ternikar writes, 'By the 1960s, ladies who brunched were often the ladies who worked Monday through Friday.' The weekends were when they got to socialize and spend their hard-earned money."

	<TEXT> Day-to-day, you don't really notice that they're there unless you're walking by a refugee home. But there are a lot of institutional problems [edit: by problems, I mean barriers to assimilation]. Most of the refugees living in Germany have long asylum processes ahead of them, so they're kind of in limbo and won't really be on track to integrate until they're approved (and many won't be).

There have been some serious issues with refugees [not having real access to the German healthcare system](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/does-germany-need-to-rethink-its-policies-on-healthcare-for-refugees). 

Though of course there are some nice stories too, like a program [teaching refugees to code](http://refugeesonrails.org/en/) so they'll have job skills when they enter the labor market. And a cool program at Potsdam University [preparing refugee teachers to work in the German school system](http://www.rbb-online.de/politik/thema/fluechtlinge/brandenburg/2016/04/gefluechtete-lehrer-potsdam-fortbildung.html).  </TEXT>

Daher will ich gerne zu den englischen Podcasts, die ich regelmig hre, auch einige deutschen hinzufgen. Sanft und Sorgfltig wrde mir schon empfohlen, ist aber nicht wirklich mein Geschmack.  Deutschlandradio finde ich manchmal gut aber andererseits auch oft etwas zu seris. Was gibt es sonst fr Optionen?

Als Gegenleistung empfehle ich hier mal fr diejenigen, die sich dafr interessieren, einige englischsprachige Podcasts, die ich besonderes Unterhaltsam finde:

[Slate Podcasts](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts.html) (insb. [Political Gabfest](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gabfest.html), [Culture Gabfest](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest.html), [Slate Money](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/slate_money.html))

This interview published last week offers an fascinating context in which to place yesterday's attack on the MSF-supported hospital in Syria. That attack is getting international attention, [including here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4gtmhl/airstrike_destroys_doctors_without_borders/), so it's interesting to realize that it's just the latest of over 358 similar incidents.
