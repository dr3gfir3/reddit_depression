	<TITLE> How do I [35/M] get my mom and girlfriend to stop asking me for suggestions about stuff I have no interest in? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> They both ask me for suggestions often.  When I have something to offer, I offer it.  Sometimes I don't care or have no insight into the problem.  For example, most "girly" things.  They'll ask me to help pick out jewelry for each other as birthday gifts.  They'll ask me my which blouse looks best.  Or whatever.

I honestly do not care, and I don't think my opinion counts anyway.  How am I an expert on fashion?  I'm not.  They should know better than me.  I say thinks like, "Whichever you want" or "I don't know" or "It's not my area" and they seem to get upset.

Is there some secret to just getting them off my back about this and trusting me when I say "I don't know"?  

It's not like I'm indecisive.  If they ask me a question I have an opinion about or am knowledgeable about, I'll tell them what I think.

**tl;dr:**  I don't have an opinion, but my mom and girlfriend try to force one out of me anyway. </TEXT>
