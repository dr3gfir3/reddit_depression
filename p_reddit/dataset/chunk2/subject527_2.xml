	<TEXT> Mine is hormone related and Insulin related. Yes everyone can be at a healthy weight and unfortunately I'm not 100% sure why i couldn't do it the natural way but I have been on shakes, pills, all the healthy eating diets, fad diets EVERYTHING and nothing worked...at most I would lose 3 - 4 kg and that would be over 6 months.  </TEXT>
