	<TEXT> The guy they got information about uploading the youtube clip. His name was leaked and everyone started hating on him, as they would. Police interviewed him and he was no longer in interest of the police.

	<TEXT> As a few other states it depends on the teacher, the connection between them and yourself. I, for example, took a subject with network engineering and administration. But the teacher didn't feel like a teacher. He felt more like a Co-worker and a friend. There'd be days I'd sit in the lab until he said he had to close the school for the day because the automated alarm was soon to start. 

We always enjoyed classes whit him. They were raw, funny yet we always learned something.

Then I had a teacher in Advanced English (I'm swedish so I apologize for any mistakes). This teacher was from Canada, which meant his English was amazing... my previous teachers still had that shitty swedish accent. 
What he did to make me interested and listen to him was that he always had new stuff to do, we never did the same thing in class. And when it was time for talking about grades and stuff he was really straight forward. example. "So, unicorn. There's a few places where you can approve; usage of commas, still pronouncing a few words wrong. Want to iprove on both of them or just one? And how would you like to do it?" It was great to decide for myself, and decide how to do it aswell. 

TL;DR Teacher #1 - He treated me like a co-worker. I hated being treated like a 5 year old in school.

Teacher #2 - He gave me my own choices and he also made everyone feel okay with making misstakes in class. No-one would laugh. And if they would laugh it'd be with the person, not at the person.

HOPE IT HELPED. SORRY FOR LONG POST 

Love to you all 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know what you mean...

Just try to give abit of yourself, not too much. If the person of your interest doesn't bite, you should probably move on and see if you can find someone else. At some point you'll find someone who will give back, and intrigue you to share more of yourself. I too, am single, 20 M and I've been shot down so many times I rather not put myself out there. 

I'm going along my daily life to see if i can't find someone who likes me, and shows interest in me first. And the way I do this is by being myself and just... That's it really. Just be yourself! 

I wish you the best of luck, dearest one! </TEXT>
