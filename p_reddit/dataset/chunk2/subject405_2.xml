[Navigable networks as Nash equilibria of navigation games](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150703/ncomms8651/full/ncomms8651.html)

by Andrs Gulys, Jzsef J. Br, Attila Krsi, Gbor Rtvri and Dmitri Krioukov

 **Abstract**

 Common sense suggests that networks are not random mazes of purposeless connections, but that these connections are organized so that networks can perform their functions well. One function common to many networks is targeted transport or navigation. Here, using game theory, we show that minimalistic networks designed to maximize the navigation efficiency at minimal cost share basic structural properties with real networks. These idealistic networks are Nash equilibria of a network construction game whose purpose is to find an optimal trade-off between the network cost and navigability. We show that these skeletons are present in the Internet, metabolic, English word, US airport, Hungarian road networks, and in a structural network of the human brain. The knowledge of these skeletons allows one to identify the minimal number of edges, by altering which one can efficiently improve or paralyse navigation in the network. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love to go hiking and never use a photography backpack. My camera for hiking is the Panasonic GM1 with two of my pancakes: 12-32mm, 14mm and 20mm. Sometimes I take my 14-150mm instead which fits in the same bag as well (without a second lens, though). This fits in a very small camera bag which I either carry over my shoulder or in my backbag.

I still have to find a photography backbag which has a compact enough section for camera gear and a large enough section for everything else. On the other hand, my solution fits my needs perfectly fine. </TEXT>

However, this subreddit is a very civil and fine community. So we should not understand the announcement of the new group as enticement of users, as an invitation to move, but as an addition instead.

That being said, when I joined Snapzu, I got three invitation codes which are still unused. Everybody can read and take openly published codes and that's why I removed the codes after posting them here yesterday. If you want an invitation code, please feel free to send me a PM: if you are an active member of this group, you will get one as long as I have one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My answer to the first part of your comment concerning the banned subreddits is:

I didn't frequent them either, but at least I looked into one of them because a discussion in /r/Stoicism. As far as I know about the banned subreddits, if banning them meant the end of reddit, the end of reddit would be well-deserved. That does not mean that everything is ok with reddit, but one has to look more closely who complains loudly concerning freedom of speech and why. Sometimes it's not because freedom of speech at all. </TEXT>

Although I grant that there could be questions not to be asked for legal reasons, dismissioning moderators and banning users because of hard questions seems to be a rather vicious act to me. Being able to cope with critical voices virtuously would be so much better than reacting like that, but it seems that it's more trendy to disallow everything which could interfere with what I'd call a narcissistically oriented self-image. </TEXT>

Not that you denied that, but wanting to achieve the best possible technical quality is a completely valid position and he also explains why it is so important to him ([ultraprint](http://blog.mingthein.com/2014/02/27/introducing-the-ultraprint/)). To be fair, he has already shown photos he took with his mobile and also accepts such photos for his Flickr group.

	<TEXT> The impact of Luther's translation is huge indeed. I want to add that Luther was the first who published the protestant New Testament, but the first complete protestant bible was the *Zrcher Bibel* of 1531. Huldrych Zwingli was one of its translators.

Revisions of both bible translations are still in use. While the Luther bible has been revised carefully to keep Luther's language as much as possible, the Zrcher bible has been retranslated several times (the last time in 2007) and is both more precise and easier to understand than the Luther bible.

	<TEXT>  Today, there is a big general incentive towards healthier lifestyles (among first-worlders). Gluten-free diet, veganism, you name it.

The claims of these people are mostly not supported by scientific research at all. Many of these "healthier" lifestyles are actually rather unhealthy.

 This alone turns me off. At this point, there are very few people on earth who follow a gluten-free diet that I might take seriously. It's like a religion, they want you to join their side so much. I say this because I know it is a turnoff for many other people.

You are right with your comparison with religion. This is turning off a lot of serious people indeed.

 Meditation is real. It's not a belief.

Yes, and that's why it is good to see scientific research being done which shows exactly that meditation is a real thing. On the other hand, opposing scientific research or showing its results, respectively, is exactly what fits better with bullshit. I wouldn't expect that from someone who calls himself *a very no-bullshit person*.

Posting links to every wishy-washy article about positive effects of meditation is certainly contraproductive, but posting links to articles being based on sound scientific research should be perfectly fine. I think, opposing that is contraproductive, too. </TEXT>

 Epicurus did not discuss evil as theological problem. He was interested in the practical problem of living well, and his discussion of goods and evils is part of his solution to this problem. It is in this connection that Epicurus makes a lasting contribution to understanding evil and its causes. He rejected the dominate line of thought from the classical tradition of Plato and Aristotle. Epicurus seems to have been an empiricist, not a rationalist. From within this perspective, he developed a new understanding of the good life.

	<TEXT>  **Abstract**

 This essay proposes to share with the readers some of the experiences of using commentaries on Sanskrit texts, particularly philosophical texts. No Sanskrit work can be understood properly or adequately without the help of commentaries yet the commentators were not and could not be omniscient. After providing an overview of how ancient texts in India were taught by the gurus and how in course of time commentary writing side by side oral instruction came into being, it is shown that all commentaries cannot be reliable on all occasions. The time lag between the base text and the commentaries thereon often disables the commentators to be certain about the collocation of the words, especially technical words in the base text. Secondly, lack of historical sense often makes the commentators opt for untenable significations of certain terms occurring in the base text. Thirdly, the personal philosophical affiliation of the commentators often misleads them to interpret the text in a way inconsistent with the intention of the original author. All this has been shown with examples selected from various texts, philosophical and otherwise, and their commentaries. The essay concludes that commentaries are doubtless necessary and helpful and should be made use of wherever available; nevertheless it must be kept in mind that ancient commentators were no less, if not more, fallible than we are and their works should be treated with caution, not regarding them as the last word, as some students and scholars still do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So the fact that their philosophical system included the gods (plural) was unremarkable.

Did it include the gods? Actually, it did not. That's the point you miss. Their theology was not polytheistic, which was the given in ancient Rome and Greece, their God is pantheistic and rather similar to Spinoza's God. Basically, one can use *God* and *Nature* interchangeably. Take that and providence away and you leave Stoicism. The point is: what you claim as fact is not the case at all.

 in our modern world atheism is a given.

In our modern world secularism, the separation of state and religion, is a given (at least in Western democracies). Atheism is still the minor position.

 The essence of the Stoic life is self-reliance, the capacity to remain calm and equable in the face of whatever life throws at you.

The essence of Stoicism is that *arete* (excellence of character, virtue) is necessary and sufficient for *eudaimonia* (human flourishing, happiness in life).

 That attitude is totally antithetical to reliance on the grace of a superior being, which is the hallmark of Christianity.

It's true that Stoicism is *antithetical to reliance on the grace of a superior being*. But I cannot fully agree otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fear of pain is something I think Epicurus' argumentation may not be as helpful for as his argumentation concerning the fear of the gods and the fear of death. According to Epicurus, strong pain only lasts for a short while and long lasting pain is not strong. In ancient Greece that may have been the case, since most problems which lead to strong pain most probably lead to death soon in ancient times.

	<TEXT>  As for your other point, could you point to any text supporting your position on a single god in Stoicism?

Read, for example, the Chapter *4. Stoic physics* from John Sellars' [*Stoicism*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources isbn=0520249089), beginning at page 91 (*God and Nature*). According to Sellars the Stoic God was a philosophical god and can be seen as *the providential ruling force in Nature*. The Stoics can be seen as pantheists identifying God with Nature. It was also common among Stoics to see Nature as a living being. Sellars points to the theological discussions in Cicero's *On the Nature of the Gods*, Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus and Diogenes Laertius.

 Stoicism was Greek and Roman, and by no stretch of the imagination was Graeco-Roman religion monotheistic.

In ancient Rome they had to follow the usual ritualistic acts and this they certainly did. However, Stoic theology was rather different to Roman polytheism. On the other hand, I would not call their theology *monotheistic* because that refers to a personal god. /u/paniniconqueso basically describes the Stoic God as monotheistic god which is certainly not true. The Stoic God was a pantheistic God, the Stoics identified God with Nature.

 Saying that their many gods represented a single entity is again a Christian reinterpretation of their beliefs.

The monotheistic interpretation of the Stoic God certainly is a Christian reinterpretation and is wrong. On the other hand, the Stoics were no polytheists, either. </TEXT>

I really like Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, but I am not comfortable with recommending it as a general introduction to Stoicism, since it is the result of Marcus Aurelius' Stoic practice which was never thought to be read by anyone else than Marcus Aurelius himself. For someone knowing what it is, it is highly valuable concerning Stoic practice, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But there is a difference between suggesting a hypothesis because you think it might be supported and having results that actually support the hypothesis, right?

In my opinion you are splitting hairs. It's not a theory, it's just a hypothesis.

What is a hypothesis? [Merriam-Webster is your friend](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypothesis):

 an idea or theory that is not proven but that leads to further study or discussion

[And what did they write](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129118)?

 As earlier research by Zoia et al [[31](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129118#pone.0129118.ref031), [33](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129118#pone.0129118.ref033)] showed, the kinematic patterns of the movements of fetuses reflect intentional actions, and advanced motor planning, therefore it is plausible to suggest that the observed fetal responses to the voice and touch in the present study may have a communicative intent. </TEXT>

 Mothers, fathers and other family members talk and even sing to the fetus throughout pregnancy with communicative intent. Many report changes in the fetal behaviour as a response to such communication. And although we used the term touch, the condition however was not direct skin-to-skin contact but an indirect stimulation of the fetus via stroking the abdomen applying slight pressure. Similarly to talking to the fetus, most mothers and even fathers attempt to communicate with and regulate the behaviour of the fetus via stroking of the mothers abdomen as a response to the kicking or positional movements of the fetus. Even the expecting mothers mood is affected by massaging the abdomen resulting in reduced depression [[36](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129118#pone.0129118.ref036)].

	<TEXT>  **Abstract**

 Despite the increasing attention that has been paid by contemporary scholarship to the place of philosophy within elite Roman society, this article argues that the extent of Epicurean affiliation during the Late-Republic has failed to be adequately recognized or narrated. This study assembles numerous literary and epigraphical sources, of both Epicurean and non-Epicurean provenance, to help refine our understanding of the diffusion of the philosophy during this period. Recent papyri finds from Herculaneum are also integrated into the discussion, allowing the notable influence that Epicurean teachers on the Italian peninsula enjoyed to be demonstrated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Buddha never denied nor claimed the existence of a permanent self.

The Buddha did not deny a self indeed, but he definitely denied a permanent self. This teaching is known as *anatta* which is one of the most central Buddhist teachings. According to Buddha there is no permanence at all and that is certainly true for the self.

The self the Buddha did not deny can be seen as what we may describe as an emergent phenomenon of several processes today. Traditionally these are called the *khandhas* (in Pali) or *aggregates* (in English): matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  **Abstract**

 This Masters thesis examines two conflicting images that can be presented in contemporary scholarship on the classical Epicurean movement: that they are either a reclusive and isolated group, or that they had a missionary dynamic/purpose akin to that seen in the later Christian missionary movement. Sources for the first generation of the school are examined, and it is suggested that the Epicurean movement held an open-closed dynamic with regards to mission: incorporating features that both expedite, but also restrict the inclusion of outsiders into the group. Epicurean doctrine is also probed to find features that would either broaden or limited any missionary concept in the school. The closed dynamic is found to have come under pressure in subsequent generations, particularly from Epicurean adherents on Roman soil; where popularisers, in conflict with earlier generations of the school, sought to overtly proselytize their message. Lucretius intention as missionary to the educated elite of Roman is explored, and a chapter examining the extent of Epicurean influence on the Roman elite is also provided. </TEXT>

[Universal decoherence due to gravitational time dilation](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphys3366.html)

by Igor Pikovski, Magdalena Zych, Fabio Costa and aslav Brukner

 **Abstract**

 The physics of low-energy quantum systems is usually studied without explicit consideration of the background spacetime. Phenomena inherent to quantum theory in curved spacetime, such as Hawking radiation, are typically assumed to be relevant only for extreme physical conditions: at high energies and in strong gravitational fields. Here we consider low-energy quantum mechanics in the presence of gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads to the decoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation induces a universal coupling between the internal degrees of freedom and the centre of mass of a composite particle. The resulting correlations lead to decoherence in the particle position, even without any external environment. We also show that the weak time dilation on Earth is already sufficient to affect micrometre-scale objects. Gravity can therefore account for the emergence of classicality and this effect could in principle be tested in future matter-wave experiments. </TEXT>

by Thomas Dietz, Kenneth A. Frank, Cameron T. Whitley, Jennifer Kelly, and Rachel Kelly

 **Abstract**

 Starting at least in the 1970s, empirical work suggested that demographic (population) and economic (affluence) forces are the key drivers of anthropogenic stress on the environment. We evaluate the extent to which politics attenuates the effects of economic and demographic factors on environmental outcomes by examining variation in CO2 emissions across US states and within states over time. We find that demographic and economic forces can in part be offset by politics supportive of the environmentincreases in emissions over time are lower in states that elect legislators with strong environmental records. </TEXT>

[Having a Lot of a Good Thing: Multiple Important Group Memberships as a Source of Self-Esteem](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124609)

by Jolanda Jetten, Nyla R. Branscombe, S. Alexander Haslam, Catherine Haslam, Tegan Cruwys, Janelle M. Jones, Lijuan Cui, Genevieve Dingle, James Liu, Sean Murphy, Anh Thai, Zoe Walter, Airong Zhang

 **Abstract**

 Membership in important social groups can promote a positive identity. We propose and test an identity resource model in which personal self-esteem is boosted by membership in additional important social groups. Belonging to multiple important group memberships predicts personal self-esteem in children (Study 1a), older adults (Study 1b), and former residents of a homeless shelter (Study 1c). Study 2 shows that the effects of multiple important group memberships on personal self-esteem are not reducible to number of interpersonal ties. Studies 3a and 3b provide longitudinal evidence that multiple important group memberships predict personal self-esteem over time. Studies 4 and 5 show that collective self-esteem mediates this effect, suggesting that membership in multiple important groups boosts personal self-esteem because people take pride in, and derive meaning from, important group memberships. Discussion focuses on when and why important group memberships act as a social resource that fuels personal self-esteem. </TEXT>

Several Sony Alpha lenses are still old Minolta designs and some of them do not meet today's standards, but that's not much different with some of Canon's and Nikon's older designs. Thus I think that you did not describe the quality of Sony's lenses well by saying that Sony glass sucks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it is true that Sony has some really excellent lenses and only very few that suck (and as far as I know none of these are native FE), lenses are Sony's weakness nevertheless, however not in the sense as said above. Sony is by far not as quick in releasing lenses as in releasing bodies and although it is hard to catch up with old and complete systems like Canon and Nikon, Sony certainly could do better. Fuji, for example, has been much better in that. </TEXT>

The site linked by /u/Samana_Johann is thought as a mirror of the original site and is supposed to offer Buddhist texts in German. Some of the original content has been translated, but there may also be original German content. Although German is my mother language, I don't use that site, but I can say, to the best of my knowledge, that it isn't a spamming site.

Obviously, /u/Samana_Johann uses that version instead of the original and does not look for the corresponding links to the original.

	<TEXT>  We'll have to agree to disagree on the first point. I think "meditation" as a concept has been tainted beyond recovery.

If I do, I use the word *meditation* in context with Stoicism exclusively within groups of people I assume to know more about meditation than the broad public. If I have any reason to assume that people just know the stereotyped understanding of meditation, I will completely abstain from using the word *meditation* in context with Stoicism.

 It's almost inconceivable that the Stoics were unaware of Buddhism and Asian religious traditions considering that the Greek philosophical community was so tight-knit and that philosophers often traveled with men of power.

I may have been much too imprecise by writing that *the ancient Stoics did not know Buddhism and Asian religious traditions*, since we do not know what exactly they knew about other cultures. But we know that, if they had substantial knowledge, at least the Stoics were excellent in hiding that knowledge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There's too much baggage to continue using the word like we are.

A part of what the Christian tradition used to call *contemplation* is what we call *meditation* today and some of the Stoic's practices were what we call *a kind of meditation* today. It's obvious that you do not like the word *meditation*, but that's no reason not to use the word anymore. There are a lot of meditation techniques and what most people associate it with is just a small part of what is called meditation. The ignorance of most people of a given field should not forbid the usage of some words within that given field.

  ancient Stoics did not know Buddhism and Asian religious traditions

 I'm curious where you got this. Hellenistic philosophy absolutely was in direct contact with Buddhist traditions as a result of Alexander's conquests.

Actually, I consciously call myself *subject405* after one of the philosophers who joined Alexander the Great on his trip to Asia. He was no Stoic, though. The influence of Asian philosophy on Greek philosophy is widely overstressed and although it can be argued in favor of an influence on Pyrrhonian skepticism, a direct and substantial influence on Stoicism is far fetched and widely not assumed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The only reason the modern idea of meditation seems to be associated with Stoicism is the title of Marcus Aurelius' Stoic masterwork.

This is not even cheap polemic...

Of course, in Stoicism there is no meditation tradition which is as rich as in Buddhism, but it is totally wrong to say that there is no meditation and mindfulness tradition at all. It is further wrong to say that the meditation rechniques practiced by Buddhists are the only meditation techniques, although it is correct that (apart from mindfulness) the Buddhist meditation techniques are typically not what Stoics practiced.

However, what Stoics practiced is what we call *mindfulness* today. In Stoicism this is called *prosoch* and is described in [Prosoch: Illuminating the Path of the Prokoptn (PDF)](http://collegeofstoicphilosophers.org/show_book/PDF/ChrisFisher-Prosoche-IlluminatingthePathoftheProkopton) to mention one example of literature. There are Stoic practices which can perfectly legitimate and undoubtedly be called *meditation*, although the ancient Stoics did not know Buddhism and Asian religious traditions and there are significant differences concerning the techniques and the meaning and status within the teachings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is one of the most cited and misunderstood Suttas and is mostly cited in order to justify free inquiry, strip teachings like rebirth from Buddhism and secularize Buddhism. [Bhikkhu Bodhi writes](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_09.html):

 Though the discourse certainly does counter the decrees of dogmatism and blind faith with a vigorous call for free investigation, it is problematic whether the sutta can support all the positions that have been ascribed to it. On the basis of a single passage, quoted out of context, the Buddha has been made out to be a pragmatic empiricist who dismisses all doctrine and faith, and whose Dhamma is simply a freethinkers kit to truth which invites each one to accept and reject whatever he likes.

 But does the Kalama Sutta really justify such views? Or do we meet in these claims just another set of variations on that egregious old tendency to interpret the Dhamma according to whatever notions are congenial to oneself  or to those to whom one is preaching? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/9209364/The_Buddhas_skill_in_means_and_the_genesis_of_the_five_aggregate_teaching)

The problem tackled in this article is ambitious. Through examination of how certain fundamental teachings of the Buddha originated  the author argues that those teachings must indeed go back to the Buddha himself. Thus the author builds a chain of argument which creates hypothetical links rather than declaring a priori that links and connection cannot be established.

This article argues that the Alagaddupama Sutta, an important early Buddhist text, portrays the Buddha in the process of formulating his thoughts. If so it contradicts the myth that the Buddha awakened to the entire Buddhist Dharma on one occasion, and should be dated to the fourth century BCE. Such an antiquity, and peculiar didactic structure suggests that the text contains authentic teachings of  the Buddha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most basic and fundamental teaching of Buddha, *anatta*, that what we experience as self is no permanent and independent substance, but an emergent phenomenon of diverse processes instead, is widely compatible with science and does not need faith anymore. The rest is essentially a consequence of that insight and can mostly be argued for in a very rational way, although there are exceptions like the teaching of rebirth which is difficult to be argued for at least from the standpoint of Western philosophy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, Buddhist counseling can be done in a good way, but also in a bad way. I think that [immanentfire has a good point](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/38pyoz/rbuddhism_can_we_tone_down_the_dogma_a_bit/crx3drm). There is a phenomenon called *spiritual bypassing* which should be avoided indeed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That's literally the entire point of Buddhism.

Exactly. That's why I wrote in [my reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/38pyoz/rbuddhism_can_we_tone_down_the_dogma_a_bit/cry8upo)

 Basically, that's what Buddhism is about and what Buddha taught regarding suffering. Withholding what Buddhism offers for the suffering of those seeking advice may even be evil and in my opinion it is evil indeed.

and

 If one is ill and comes to a physician, one is supposed to hear medical advice and to get a medical treatment. Nobody would expect the physician to refrain from dense ramblings about the nature and cure of the illness. This is exactly what the physician is supposed to do and that is true regarding the advice on suffering in /r/Buddhism as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If a lay cultural Buddhist comes here asking for advice to help deal with the sorrow of a recent break up, is it really wise to beat them over the head with dense ramblings about the unreality of the self or universal nature of suffering from attachment?

Basically, that's what Buddhism is about and what Buddha taught regarding suffering. Withholding what Buddhism offers for the suffering of those seeking advice may even be evil and in my opinion it is evil indeed. It surely makes a difference how one talks to each other in such cases, but at the end of the day that's what someone coming here for advice on suffering is supposed to hear. If one comes to /r/Buddhism, one is supposed to read about Buddhism and what Buddhism has to say about one's matter instead of just some psychological phrases for self-help (that's what /r/selfhelp is for).

EDIT: If one is ill and comes to a physician, one is supposed to hear medical advice and to get a medical treatment. Nobody would expect the physician to refrain from *dense ramblings about the nature and cure of the illness*. This is exactly what the physician is supposed to do and that is true regarding the advice on suffering in /r/Buddhism as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It only depends on your taste. 28mm would be too wide for me as only lens, but quite perfect in combination with the 55mm. If I have to choose a single lens, it will be 40mm (which I actually choose as single lens within my own system). But your mileage may vary - it really is a matter of your own personal vision. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Even when they talk about some of its real content in the west, often parts are left out. I didn't know until much older that rebirth included as gods or in hells.

That's so right. That's one of the reason why I like Damien Keown's highly recommendable book *Buddhism, A Very Short Introduction* so much. It is a short and very clear introduction, but he even manages to explain such relatively unknown facts like Buddhist hells and heaven. </TEXT>

The more I learned about Buddhism, the worse my thoughts on that work got. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only few people are trained in critical thinking, most pick up all sort of things and believe they know something. Unfortunately, a lot of people call themselves Buddhists and don't have a clue. There are even introductionary books about Buddhism written by people not having a clue at all.

There are people who seem to believe that Hermann Hesse's *Siddhartha* is an introduction to Buddhism and Robert M. Pirsig's *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* is about Zen and Benjamin Hoff's *The Tao of Pooh* is about Taoism. *The Tao of Pooh*, for example, is often recommended by people calling themselves Taoists and someone who does not have a clue may think that these people knew what they are talking (or writing) about.

I think, if one doesn't have a clue and listen to people who call themselves *secular Buddhists* or to those who are basically esoterics calling themselves Buddhists, it may be extremely easy to adopt false views about Buddhism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I get upset when they don't acknoweldge it after an explanation and just get mad

You expect too much because there are only few people who acknowledge their errors in internet forums. Especially irrational people do not respond to rational arguments well.

The best thing is to explain their errors in a sober way and not to expect anything from them. As long as they react in an acceptable manner one can go on discussing the matter with them, but that may not always happen.

By the way, you do not know how many other people read and learn from your comments, so giving expanations may not necessarily be in vain even in the case the people you are answering to react in a negative way. It can still be frustrating, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, I really like this talk and do not think that "not bad" is an exact description of it. This talk would fit in a list of recommended talks about Buddhism and its teachings, but it is neither bad Eastern philosophy nor is it about bad Eastern philosophy. It is more about Buddhism than philosophy anyway. If there is a list of recommended Buddhist talks at /r/badEasternPhilosophy, this talk may be a good candidate. However, at the moment there does not seem to be such a list (although there used to be one). </TEXT>
