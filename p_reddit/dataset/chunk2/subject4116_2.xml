	<TEXT> That is incorrect. As I said in the top comment, if you pmed the name "Belton" it would go to, as far as I can tell, one of the three at random. When you did /whois Belton it would return one of the three, as far as I can tell, at random. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not aware of any way to determine the amount of a specific unique on the market besides either parsing the API yourself or just counting how many items poe.trade shows per page, then counting the number of pages.

	<TEXT> Sure it is, It's just not t1. Mjolner in general is probably t2-t3, LL Mjolner is maybe T1.5. But for the currency you have to put into it to get it to that point it's probably T3. </TEXT>
