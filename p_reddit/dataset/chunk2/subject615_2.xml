	<TEXT> I feel like it's due to being a recipe for some sort of disasterimplemented to stop the changes of finding glitches and bugs with the trading system and whatnot.

Obviously if you're split-screening you know the person you're with very well (arguably), and thus you would be able to trust them and try new things and from an outside perspective it just seems a little sketchy even if you truly do have good intentions.

I too have questioned but then thought about it from Psyonix's viewpoint and it makes more sense. Hope this helps or maybe I'm just ranting but either way have a good day :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WHY DO WE SOLELY RANK UP OR DOWN BASED ON OUR TEAM PERFORMANCE AND NOT HOW WE PLAY/MEASURE AS AN INDIVIDUAL (solo queueing problem, but still a problem nonetheless).

I WANT PERFORMANCE/MVP/CARRYING RANKING SYSTEM WHERE THOSE WHO SHINE BUT LOSE GET "PUNISHED" LESS AND THOSE WHO CANT EVEN REACH 200 POINTS IN A MATCH ARE THE ONES WHO SUFFER </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm silver 3 in solo standard , bouncing in between gold 1 and high divs of silver 3. I know this is typically everyone's philosophy but it just seems like the teammates I always get paired with couldn't even carry a pencil if they tried </TEXT>
