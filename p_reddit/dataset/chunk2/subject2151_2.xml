	<TEXT> My wife-to-be was ordered deported in 1995 (for not showing up to an asylum hearing for which she recieved no notice) and I married her quickly after to "sort it out." I did want to marry her anyway, it just changed the timetable. Long story short, it is now 2016 and she still has no permanent residency, and the daughter she brought with her is now 23 and also has no legal residency. 
And no solution in sight. </TEXT>
