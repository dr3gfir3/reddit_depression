	<TEXT> This is sweet and well-intentioned. But sometimes when the kufr do this kind of stuff, it seems patronizing. 

Like I do not need/want their support or approval. I also do not need their "protection." I fear none but Allah Subhanahu Wa T'ala! Especially not some old, Canadian white man.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have all of the aforementioned in Saudi, too. Paved roads, zoning, A/C everywhere, lots of English (though Arabic is a far superior language), many universities, friends, cars, and fast internet.

	<TEXT> I miss my family, but I was living on the opposite coast (they're in California, I was in Philly and then NYC) for nearly a decade. And I have my husband now, and am creating a family with him. 

I miss Whole Foods. But really, the KSA has nearly everything America has and I feel it's only a matter of time before a Whole Foods pops up. 

I don't miss Amazon as they ship to Saudi. It takes a bit longer and costs a bit more, but not by inordinate amounts. 

I never want to live in America ever ever ever again. Visiting will always be necessary though since keeping up family ties is crucial in our Deen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, Arabs are still a pretty racist lot. But this is down to culture, not our Deen. Our Deen is the most perfect and non-racial. </TEXT>
