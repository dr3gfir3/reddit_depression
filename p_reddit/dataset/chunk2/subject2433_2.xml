	<TEXT> im not sure where else to ppost this, but this seemed apporpriate. ive been trying to find out why ive been depressed, and after doing some thinking and meditation and trying to figure out the reasons behind the way i feel I think one of the big reasons I may be depressed is because life is unfair and I feel bitter.

Ever since I've been a kid no one ever explained to me the reason behind all the bad things that happened to me, and it made me feel bitter, and I still do. I mean if people can do bad shit and get away with it, and bad things happen to those who didnt deserve it, then what the fuck is keeping the world from falling apart? Why isn't there total chaos if order simply does not exist? What is the point?

I was reading something too, about something called existential depression. Its basically where your too smart for your own good and you think about the reasons behind everything, and you get depressed at the results of what you do, or don't, see. I don't see the point behind things in life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now I feel extremely lonely right now, because I'm on summer break from from college, and all of my friends I made are from that college (and being summer break, they all went back far away to their homes). 

I'm basically stuck at home right now and so damn lonely, and I don't know how to make friends around here. I'm asking for books because books do seem to help me calm down when i read them and not feel so frustrated.

I'm afraid of approaching people and I dont even know where to begin to try and make friends. I did try meetup.com, but the only groups nearby are basically for mothers. I thought of going to a bar but I'm afraid of going to a bar alone. I would try the gym I go to, but I don't know where to start there either.

I'm trapped, frustrated, and depressed from being lonely, and I don't know what to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm looking for friends just to hang out and do things with. I'm up for just about anything, from video games to going to bars.

I'm in Brookfield right now, and on summer break from college right now, and I have no friends at home so its quite boring, i'm really tired of sitting around all day at home playing video games, and it would be nice to get out and do something with people.

also if you work out and want to work out together that would be awesome too, since I'm working out on trying to lose weight and working out with other people is much more fun

	<TITLE> having trouble getting motivated at the gym and sticking to diet </TITLE>

	<TEXT> hi, I've been going to the gym every day in an effort to try and lose weight, as well as trying to follow a diet for the last month or so

problem is I'm losing at every turn and obsticle. I do go to the gym every day, but after 15 min on an elliptical I get so worn out/bored that I just can't continue any longer, and that's even with watching Netflix on my phone. I do try to do weights, but because I'm intimidated by most of the guys doing weights I'm restricted to maybe 4 machines which I do each time I'm there. I had a feeling that getting a gym buddy would help, but I have no friends nearby and its doubtful that anyone on reddit goes to the same gym in Chicago suburbs I do

and for the eating part I'm doing very bad too. I'm trying to follow a strict diet my mom did to lose weight, and I mean its really strict about everything, even which fruits and vegetables you can eat. well every day I'm finding that I cheat, usually going out to get 2 big slices of pizza everyday. yesterday was the worst, were I was bored and instead of going to the gym I go to McDonald's and eat there, then go to the story and get candy and eat all of it.

its like I don't even have the motivation to lose weight, even though I want to. I keep getting the thought In my mind that I can't do it, I try to fight it but looking at all my recent fuck ups, like cheating everyday, it really seems like I can't do this, even more so since I've been big for as long as I can remember. it doesn't help either that my mom is constantly trying to guilt trip me into doing this, it just makes me feel like shit and less wanting to do it

what can I do to get on track and get motivated at the gym and to eat better? what can I do to stop the negative attitude? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will do, thanks. It looks promising so I'll give it a shot. Also, Any recommendations for which CBT book I should get?

One more thing though maybe you can help me with. One reason I realized I have trouble making friends is because I'm too afraid to approach people, and go out and do new things by myself. I realize I missed many opportunities in life because of this, like my entire highschool period where I made no friends at all. I guess I'm really just very shy too but I don't know how to get over it.

I also feel like I'm so different from other people because it feels like I don't share the same experiences that so many other people have, such as having a significant other, or having an awesome highschool experience, or working very hard to achieve some goal. It feels like I don't fit in and it upsets me for some reason, even when people like me I still feel like I don't fit in because I don't have similar experiences. I haven't worked very hard at things in my life either, either that or the things I worked hard at didn't amount to anything or ended up having no value </TEXT>
