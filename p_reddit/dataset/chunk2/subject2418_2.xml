But I don't know. Perhaps go to that quiet place again.

	<TEXT> Jesus spoilers? Well okay... He did some sweet miracles, preached some real good things about being a worthwhile human-- the Pharisees were not down to fuck around, perhaps because he was saying he was the son of man, and also he was preaching his own way, pretty ballsy no matter how you game; so they wanted him sliced out. They got a rat man Judas (it was an inside job)-- Judas told the Pharisees where was at just trying to digest his meal, just digeting a meal, havin a chat with his old dad in the park. His dad is all on him about his earthly duty he's got.. Jesus was hesitating, didn't matter. Judas and a squad of roman soldier boys show up on scene, take Jesus away. Judas is like... fuck what i done. They jail him, and give him a mock trial. Basically Pontious Pilate, the roman ruler of the area (Jerusalem was under Roman rule at the time), took him out front with this criminal Barabbas and asked the crowd who the wanted to live. Barabbas was well known in J-slam, so they picked him. This let Pilate feel like he wasn't guilty.  
  
Next day or so they make our man J carry a big old cross through the town. Not only are we gonna get you dead, we're gonna show you shame supreme along the way. He's whipped, given a crown of thorns. And they make him pull himself all the way to Golgotha, a rocky outcrop outside town, and at the top of this rock, with only his mom, his main gf, and the only brother of his squad still with him, referred to only as "the disciple Jesus love" (hm?).  
  
The clock strikes 3, our man J kicks it, asking up to the heavens "Father why have you forsaken me?" A line I always found very intriguing.  
  
3 days later, his girl Mary Mags, goes to visit him to polish off his body with sacrificial oils, and finds the rock that was covering his tomb moved. One would suspect that perhaps the Pharisees stole the body so he didn't go on to become a martyr whose religion would dominate the world for centuries, but on her way back to tell the others, she sees him... him... standing there. He looks different, but there he is.  
  
A little later Thomas (doubting thomas) is strolling outskirts of town, when there he is. Thomas is like no way J, I saw you get it. J is like, feel this. He has Thomas stick his hand into his exposed gooey wound. Thomas is like, yeah that's real. He goes and tells the other. A little later Jesus appears to them all. Never really hanging out like before, more like an Obi-Wan/half ethereal phase. And then a few weeks later, one last visitation and he's like cool I think I want to go home, I'm out. He flies up into the sky. Next thing the squad gets a visit from the holy spirit which allows them to go speak to all the people and spread J's word around earth. And so it trickled all the way around to here, where I'm telling it to you right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think what we may be seeing the initial moments of, is that specifically in Germany but I think it's a larger trend, the desire to root out cultural insensitivities, of being *told* to accept peoples or ideas without question, because it is  "right." These kinds of efforts to stymie so-called hate speech will in fact engender those very same sentiments. People and certain groups will begin to feel too much that they are being told what to believe. If this feeling grows enough, it could create a very dangerous situation; a self-perpetuating situation where, say, you are told you are racist but you feel like that is a simplification of how you feel, if not outright wrong, you will feel *even* more so feeling of being misunderstood, and alienated, by the very culture from which you come, for the sake a culture which is not your own.  
  
We all can imagine how those feelings could coalesce, so how almost bizarrely fitting that this experiment in mass exodus is being conducted in Germany. A place where the series of escalating tensions I just described above, could explode out of hand. I do not envy this problem Germany has brought upon itself, but I am fascinated with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Want to see a raw, cold blooded killer version of Inspector, where he's still got all his high-tech hi-jinks, but the killers are real. The mystery this time is a triple homicide on the south-east side. The bodies are stacked one on top of the other. They're mutaliated in such a way that they seem experimented on, with pieces of electronics coming out of them.... as if someone were trying to improve upon them... these bodies keep coming until one day they stop... because whoever created them figured out the recipe: and now there's an army of mean-ass robots with wings, and guns as hands, and they go on a rampage.. on the south east side. The Inspector is sipping on tea when one flies past the window. A stray bullet zips through the glass and explodes his tea cup. "We'll isn't that a thing." He grabs his coat, walks to the balcony flies off into a mid-air tackle of one of the flying killers. 
  
We find out Dr. Claw killed The Inspectors entire family, but Penny cold hacked him so he would forget (until reminded) and he never recalls his true motivation for chasing after Claw, until one day a Proustian madeleine reminds him of what happen and he goes through tramatic recollection of being there and being made to watch his family die. He asks Penny why she made him forget, and she says, because she wishes she could (Claw killed her family too).  
  
Can he avenge all this murder? Will he ask Penny to wipe his memory again? Will he get to the bottom of this one? Or will it get to the bottom of him.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole Kylo turning good... I been thinking about it and wondering.. how far bad can go one go and still be redeemed. I mean, if he kills Han Solo as is much supposed, can that really be forgiven? Would Finn trust him after he lops his arm off (again as is supposed)? Plus he most certainly kills a few others I'm assuming. Is this all forgivable? Can he truly turn and be an acceptable hero? I would *love* to see him go against the other Rens at some point though. Oh man, I am foaming at the mouth imagining that (which which would surely happen if he turned). The other solution to a ton of redemption, is for a last minute redemption, a la Vader.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their weapon is fear. It is the base root of all their attacks-- to create fear, vulnerability, and divide the people. That is why they try to strike us at our most together, our most normal. They want to kill the lives of goodness we've created-- and indeed perhaps we've taken our stability and our culture for granted, not knowing how great and peaceful a world we've created.  
  
That's why this, this reopening, is exactly our weapon against the weapon of fear. I encourage anyone living in Paris to go to as many shows at the Bataclan as possible. Many comments here in this thread will be voices of fear, because fear is natural, but courage must be found. Go to the Bataclan. Go to Champs-lyses. Sacre Couer. Allez partout. You are still free, they have stolen nothing. Go, allez. Then you will be the soldier against their weapon fear, and there is only one weapon you need: to continue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nazi comparisons diminish critique. Bless Germany for rebuilding, and rebranding after being the worst scourge in the history of man. However, for the love of fuck, you don't need to apologize anymore. That wrong can never be righted. I think Merkel saw an opportunity to do good, and wanted to-- but the *open invitation* to the migrants was absolute unnecessary insanity. They are risking the stability of the EU and their validity as its de facto leader with these actions (and acting like any dissent is absurd). The rest of the EU needs to ball up and say enough. Go Poland for getting the ball rolling. </TEXT>
