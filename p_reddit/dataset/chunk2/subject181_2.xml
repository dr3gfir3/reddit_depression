	<TEXT> wow you're right! there's a file of him laughing.. this is gonna be a bit crazy but there are a few elements to be connected here;
-- When you arrive at the area where the merchant is a Drake (!!) lands just in front of you in the opposite direction of where the merchant is (maybe he's hiding?)
-- That Drake afterwards stands at where a broken statue of the nameless king is
-- In Dark Souls 3 the nameless king is riding a storm drake 

could the drake from dark souls 1 have been searching for "Yulia"? maybe the merchant found her somewhere and went into hiding? maybe the storm drake in dark souls 3 is "Yulia"?? jeez.. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Minor Lore Theory] Yulia is a baby dragon crossbreed </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-16 00:10:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I posted this on r/fantheories a couple of days ago and was also wondering what you guys make of it.

Something that always weirded me out was how in Dark Souls 1 there's this Undead Merchant who keeps talking about his "little Yulia". He mentions how she's in love with him, would never leave his side, that since he has her nobody pelts him with stone anymore. He also warns you to be careful as she'll "bite" your fingers off. Hmm....

At first I thought he was referring to his sword or just plain crazy but if you look closely you can see he's petting something just above his bucket. This really seems odd even for a weird game as Dark Souls..

Later in the game you (may) find a dragon crossbreed named Priscilla and if you decide to fight her you notice that she can turn invisible. And in Dark Souls 3 you also find Oceiros holding his crossbreed baby dragon Ocelote who we don't see as it seems he is invisible.

But how in the world would he come upon such a rare creature? This I don't know but he does mention that his wares come from scavenging the bodies in the area. Could he have really found an unknown dragon crossbreed? Maybe there are clues from the items he sells..  </TEXT>

Sure some may be open to interpretation but there seems to really be a baby during that fight! With Oceiros being blind he might not even be aware that his child is invisible.. </TEXT>
