	<TEXT> It may be dumb in hindsight, but it looked fine at the time.

1. At the time of the signing, he'd just finished seasons of 141, 130, and 171 OPS+, one of which was an MVP season. Over that time he slashed .313/.370/.583.
2. The contract was only 5 years long, ranging from age 31-36. Not terrible by any means. 
3. The contract was back-loaded, and is actually worth an average of $22 mil per year. Pretty shitty, but that puts him [ranked 23rd](http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/rankings/) in baseball, which is far from the worst. 

The Hamilton contract is bad. Don't get me wrong. But it's far from the worst, not least because it was only 5 years long. I don't think any contract that's only 5 years long can be called the worst.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Because I have seen male politicians and female politicians both attacked for their looks. It's pretty common to attack politicians based on their looks. Just look at any political cartoon.

To be clear: I'm not saying men don't get attacked for their looks. I'm saying women get attacked *more* for their looks. The double standard in this past election, with insane focus on Hillary's wardrobe compared to Trump's, was nuts. 

And come on. That article is from Monica Hesse from the "Style Section" of the Washington Post. That's not the same thing as someone with a political segment saying, "I'm going to ignore all of her policy because her hair looks stupid," which is why I was clear to limit my statement to journalists/news anchors.  </TEXT>

I don't know how you could possibly believe this. 

 excuse/hand waive away any attack on men's appearance.

I'm not hand-waving *any* attack on men's appearances. There are obviously plenty of such attacks that would be inappropriate.

I am, however, waving off the mention of Trump's hair. *People* make fun of his hair, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a journalist/news anchor (is that even what you can call O'Reilly?) doing such during a live news segment.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a beginner golfer who just started playing last fall. I typically shoot around 100. 

My biggest problem is my consistency devolves as the day goes on. I'll "find" my swing at the driving range while warming up, play consistently well for the first 8-9 holes, and then fall apart after about 3 hours. Suddenly I can't hit the ball flush. I don't think it's a fitness thing; I'm not *tired* on the back 9, I just feel like the muscle memory disappears and I can't find my swing.

Is this normal for beginners? Is there any way to improve on this, or will regular practice slowly help me get over it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Usually the pitcher just fires in a strike

I would disagree with this. Usually when it happens at the last minute the pitcher totally fucks up his pitch and sails it over the backstop or buries it at 30 feet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem (as they see it) is that they used endless Benghazi hearings as ammunition against Clinton, and are afraid of the Democrats getting a toehold in the same idea.

Obviously there's a difference since Benghazi was all BS and this is a legitimate investigation, but to them it's the same idea.  </TEXT>

You have been taught wrong. Nixon spent all 2 years denying everything tooth-and-nail and then only resigned because impeachment was imminent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to play devil's advocate and defend the pitcher.

There's a phenomenon called visual fixation where, when watching something, the body will physically react in that direction. It's common in driving or cycling: you see a hazard on the road ahead like a piece of tire or trash, and it becomes difficult to avoid it because the brain is still focused on it, even though you logically know you need to move to avoid it. Same for it you stare at something on the side of the road: you'll start to drift in that direction. I'm a cyclist, and it's amazing how focusing on something with your eyes can paralyze you from other physical decision-making.

I could see that being the case for this pitcher: batter suddenly moves, pitcher follows him with his eyes, and then throws in that direction. In the video, the entire thing happens in about a quarter of a second: the batter doesn't start moving until the pitcher's hand is already pulled back. 

Or he's a dick trying to hit a guy out of spite. Could be that too.  </TEXT>

1. They want the meetings to be public, not private
2. They know Nunes is compromised and don't want to share any more information with him
3. They are nearly ready to ~~bring~~ **recommend** charges against everyone involved, thus negating the need for committee hearings.
