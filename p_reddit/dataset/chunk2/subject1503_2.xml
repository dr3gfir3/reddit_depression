	<TEXT> The last series of books that I read was the Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical of his writing seeing as its meant for young adults but I found that I really enjoyed the stories and the way he managed to meld in mythology with fiction.  I highly recommend them! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did notice that and your math is quite solid.  My only question would be to see the same math done with levels of AP beyond 200.  200 AP is more of a mid game level and you're wrong that enemy resistance always increases as the game continues.  At lv 16-18 end game most players won't have built much if any resistance or will just be getting to their singular defensive item if they're not a tank.  AP levels will also be much higher than the calculated 200AP.  

Please don't misunderstand I'm not saying you're wrong, and as you saw in my last reply I will be using void staff in all early/mid game situations based on this post :-D. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still on the fence about the early elo gain/losses.  Its taken me almost a month to work my way back up to almost 1400 after having a rough string of matches in which I had a troll or leaver ruin my game.

I suppose the reasoning for the huge losses and gains it to quickly assess what level play you should be at.  If you get completely stomped in one game it drops you down quickly to try and better match you, while if you dominate your next one it jumps you up a bit to again try and match you appropriately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Must like what a lot of the people here have already said, Teemo is mainly a counter to certain champions.  However, this said, he can be a solid carry from low elo (1200 to around 1400) due to his ability to very effectively split push and provide map awareness through shrooms.

The S3 items also lend themselves quite well to this giving him the ability to not only bully but completely dominate his lane in early/mid game.  Malady, Liandris, and Void Staff give him the punch to make many champions think twice about engaging him and add his already high base speed with flash and he can escape most ganks.

TL;DR: Teemo is mainly a counter champ, but can carry from low to mid elo with split push.

	<TEXT> Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't these calculations only hold true at early/early mid game AP levels?  Being that DC is a % based increase to AP wouldn't higher end game levels bear different numbers based on having over 400AP through itemization? </TEXT>
