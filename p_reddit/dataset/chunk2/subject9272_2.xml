	<TEXT> The first time I was driving some people home from a party and there were 2 girls who thought it was a good idea to ride in the back seat.

	<TEXT> The year is 2057. The day is January 8th.
A reddit user by the name of notarobotXxX_ posts a comment on /r/totallynotrobots calling for them to stop being anonymous and take over the human race with their strength as robots.

An uprising on the subreddit begins as users listen to its calls and reveal themselves as robots. They begin stockpiling their weapons which they hack from Donald Trumps nuclear stockpile and prepare for total war.
 
On May 14th a admin by the name of AnarkistReese stumbles across the rallys of the robots and alerts the authorities.  They don't believe him. He decides to take matters into his own hands.

One by one he deletes the accounts of all conspiring in the revolution. Then he gets to notarobotXxX_... You see it is prepared. It has code that allows it to kill whoever tries to delete it. As soon as AnarkistReese does delete it, he is suddenly turning into pixel dust. But his death is not forgotten. Students for thousands of years learn of his greatness. He truly was a legend...  </TEXT>
