	<TEXT> You think a wealthy and powerful CEO wouldn't be sufficiently butthurt at being turned down that they wouldn't do something to negatively affect a pretty young woman's career? It isn't so simple as just saying no. By engaging in this date (which is what it is), the OP's wife is putting herself in a mostly lose situation. Either the guy is a very altruistic man who simply wants to help her, or he's something else and this all ends badly. 

I don't think there's anything to do before the dinner. Cancelling could potentially be as bad as going and turning him down, so I wouldn't it's better to take the upside potential and go to dinner at this point. Just keep your eyes open, OP, and talk to her about making better decisions going forward.  </TEXT>

I get the sense that your being hypercritical of yourself. Would you talk that way about a similar looking friend? More importantly, what would you say to a similar looking friend who talked about themselves that way?

I think some self-reflection is in order for the OP, frankly. One wonders if this sort of behavior is perhaps more pervasive than we are being led to believe. Introversion is no excuse for rudeness! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to say something that isn't a direct answer to your question,  but is nonetheless something I think you need to hear...

There is no amount of money you can give your mother and family to make her give you the love and respect you crave from her. None!

The entire pattern of behavior you describe here is a familiar one to me as it mimics what I've seen my dad do with his mom. After 20 years of sending money home faithfully to support his mother and family, his siblings flat out told him he couldn't have anything of his mother's when she passed away two months ago. Not a picture, not a piece of jewelry, not a handmade shirt or scarf...nothing. In the end, nothing he did was appreciated by any of them. It was always "more, more, where's the money?" It was always about gifts and money and things, never about love. 

If you take a moment and look deep inside yourself, you will know that this is true. Cut your losses and try enjoying the fruits of your hard work for once in your life. You'll feel better because the search for validation from a bunch of people who couldn't care less about your well-being will be over. 

As an aside, your sister and her fianc are in Italy right now? Is that on vacation? Why should they get to vacation while you scrimp and save for them to get married?

	<TEXT> Your post reveals a bit of an attribution error which I'm not sure you're quite aware of. You present Carly as rational and clear-headed when she was escalating your physical relationship. Now that she is giving in to social pressure and de-escalating the physical, however, she has become some sort of dupe who isn't thinking clearly anymore. This is a self-serving line of reasoning that doesn't give her the full agency she deserves. 

The fact here is that you dove into a relationship with a religious girl dick-first and are now experiencing just how hard that can be. College is a time of questioning and people from a sheltered  and religious background can go through these Yoyo phases where they go back and forth from more to less strict in their lifestyle choices. She is probably really and truly conflicted about he sex life and how it matches her upbringing. 

Whatever you do, don't treat this change of heart as if it is temporary. You can't "make her see reason" on this matter. Instead, you need to treat this as the new state of your relationship and make decisions for yourself accordingly. If you stay it should be with the understanding that there is no more sex for the foreseeable future.  </TEXT>

Seriously, though, OP needs to read this several times and let it sink in. Mom wants an even split and an even split she shall have. Everything else in the post is the OP's personal issue and beside the point. Whatever decision the OP makes going forward, they should do it knowing the inheritance is set. 

Edit: I'm just going to reiterate the word boorish here. I just re-read your post and need to say how distressed I am that you'd quibble with your mom about the inheritance while she is dying. I cry when I even think of my mom dying! Spend more time enjoying your mom while she is still around and less time counting her money! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You aren't answering the main question asked by the last commenter. Would you give up contact with your brother to continue no contact with your sister if it were your only choice?

This is a critical question here because it is the only choice you really face right now. Your brother has threatened to stop talking to you if you won't contact your sister. You may feel he is being unduly influenced, but, like your sister was then, he is old enough to make his own choices. He is choosing her over you in this moment. You need to decide what you are willing to sacrifice in order to maintain your no contact status with the sister. 

Dealing with your brother isn't something that we will really be able to help you with. Your post gives us no solid basis upon which to really understand why he's making the decision to cut you off. As such, we can't instruct you on how to change his mind. We can all agree or disagree with your choice in dealing with your sister (I agree with the no contact for what it's worth) but that really doesn't matter because it doesn't help you in deciding how to deal with your sister. 

If you think your brother is bluffing, call his bluff. If you don't think he's bluffing, however, you need to decide if he's worth giving up no contact with your sister for. That's totally on you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. As a professor who has been on the receiving end of such offers, I can say such offers are very awkward. It leaves me worried, in my mind, that a student might think there is some debt to be repaid in the future. There's a power differential in a student-professor relationship. The less powerful person shouldn't be phony, IMHO. 

I know there are some cultural differences in this regard, however. My Chinese students, for example, are significantly more likely to try and pay the bill for some reason that I haven't worked out yet. Thus, this advice is intended for a US audience. Your mileage may vary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are several comments here encouraging you to create some drama here. This is very unusual for /r/relationships to suggest, but I'm going to hop on the bandwagon and suggest it to. 

Everyone else in this situation seems to be getting what they want. Biomom doesn't have to see you, adoptive parents avoid drama, and the rest of the family wins the argument. Meanwhile, you're left feeling like some sort of leftover. 

Well, you aren't a leftover. You are a perfectly worthy person who is entitled to their feelings and entitled to be heard. I'm not sure how forcefully you are putting the point to your moms, but you absolutely need to make it clear you aren't going to put up with it anymore. If they aren't going to do the right thing and take your side, you need to let them know in no uncertain terms that their decision is going to cost them. 

If it were me, I'd go home and date the party attendees to do something about it. That may not be something you're comfortable with, however. Letting other people in your family circle know that you're being treated this way, however, is another way of putting up a fight. Use a Facebook message announcing you've been asked to leave and tag the whole lot of these people so their friends see what they've done. 

Also, consider talking to a counselor to help work through your feelings on all this. You don't deserve this treatment! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When your future career prospects are determined in large part by your GPA, it makes sense to use every tool at your disposal to maximize your GPA. Doing everything you can to get ahead is exactly how real life works. It's true that you may not get accommodations like this in the working world, but work tasks also tend to be much more specialized than course work. The two task environments aren't directly comparable, in my view. The trick is to learn strategies to cope with each environment separately.

	<TEXT> Nope, nope, nope...this comment shows no understanding of how college works these days. While resiliency is a good character trait to have (along with that whole grit thing they talk about), this isn't about resiliency. This is about a professor making you indirectly feel bad about needing a disability accommodation. 

As a university professor, I'm told that accommodations are sacrosanct. You can "suck it up" when you join the working world, but for now you have every right to get whatever accommodation you're entitled to. The professor is opening the university up to legal liability by not complying with the ADA and your legitimate accommodation. 

Standing up for yourself is as important a learning experience as resiliency is a character trait.  </TEXT>

Now, Callie is a single woman who is seeking comfort from the wife's husband. It's not logical given the nature of the relationship between OP and Callie, but there isn't much mystery to it in my mind as to the "why."

With that said, I agree that giving in to ultimatums is never a good idea. It empowers the person giving the ultimatum and often emboldens them to make other ultimatums. If your wife has a problem with Callie, she should make that problem known and have a reasonable conversation about it rather than issuing demands and ultimatums.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok...perhaps this isn't the place for this comment, but I can't let it go unsaid just in case you aren't aware of it. How did you manage to get a job teaching history at any college? That job market is awful and I'm incredibly impressed that you're working in the field. It just makes your wife's treachery that much more obvious...she clearly doesn't appreciate that you could be an unemployed top-50 research university PhD these days. 

With that said, I'd also be remiss if I didn't chime in and say that you shouldn't get a PhD in history to spite your wife...that could literally be a ruinous decision. I like the public "calling out" route because, frankly, your wife is a jerk who is clearly jealous of you and who doesn't appreciate you. 

Edit: Holy hell - I just went back and read that you said salary. That implies that you're full time. You have a full time job as a history professor?!? You have nothing to be self-effacing about with respect to your job, man. Jesus, you're a full-fledged unicorn! No joke.  </TEXT>

The actual conference stuff consists of various sessions which I may or may not have an interest in. I attend all the sessions in my sub area and use the rest of the time for fun. At each conference, my friends and I go and do some fun things after the sessions of the day are done. I was in Minneapolis last year and went for a drive to see the house they used in Mary Tyler Moore. Go to Chicago? Shop on the Magnificent Mile. I have tickets for the theatre in NYC when I go to a conference there in a few months.

Also, the IRS has some program, I believe, where whistleblowers can be paid for helping the IRS collect on fraud cases like this. Maybe the tip will pay off for the OP! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh...that would explain the whole series of comments. Tech people, on average, have libertarian tendencies and a strangely absolutist view on the appropriateness of free markets for making decisions.

Note: I feel like the Guardian is a fairly reliable source for someone in the UK and their argument is reasonably coherent while also confirming my priors, but do feel free to argue the point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not from the UK...I'm a business professor in the US who is scouring these pages to get some insight into how people on the ground in the UK feel about the vote. 

With that disclaimer, reading your comment gives me some insight into the disconnect between various classes (for lack of a better word) of people in society. What you say on its face is true - a 10% correction in an overinflated housing market isn't going to shatter the world in the long run, although it is likely to come along with (or directly cause) a recession in the short-to-medium term. 

For people who are actually affected by those market losses, however, those losses represent life changing amounts of money. A house loses 10% of its equity and the owner can potentially no longer sell it because they are upside-down on their mortgage. Builders lay off workers because they built houses expecting one profit margin and got another one. Retirement savings drop right as some people retire. These aren't academic issues for people...they are important personal finance issues which negatively impact their lives. 

When you minimize these issues, you minimize the lives of the people impacted by them. I'm certain you aren't trying to do this, but that's how it seems to them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I am playing through the game and I realize that I made a mistake in Bevelle Temple. I clearly used the destruction sphere, but I neglected to take the treasure on my way out. Now I'm thinking ahead to getting Anima. Am I screwed, or do I only have to use the destruction sphere and not take the treasure to fulfill the Baaj Temple requirements?

Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Help me out because I'm missing something. The article says that the report is by Westerners. Are you saying that the Westerners at Falun Gong or that the report is informed by Falun Gong members who provided the content to the Westerners? Also, do you have any proof of this claim?

I've only recently taken up reading news about China and I'd like to learn how to discern the various biases within that news world, so I'll appreciate any insight you can offer.  </TEXT>
