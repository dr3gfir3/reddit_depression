	<TEXT>  I couldn't agree with him more about jump scares. The quality of a movie is inversely proportional to the number of jump scares used. It's a cheap tactic used by lazy directors.

I don't buy that. What about [the sudden shot of Pazuzu's face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD0RJ_iuBPo) in *The Exorcist*? That's totally a jump scare. 

Or look at *Friday the 13th*, and [the lunge out of the water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqKsp7UxMA8).

Or look at *Carrie*, and its famous [final jump scare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAXU_7EyXFE).

Or look at *Jaws*; the scariest [scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I91DJZKRxs) in that movie are [jump scares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFyoBf0CWI).

Or go back fifteen years, to the movie that legitimized the horror genre, *Psycho*, which is remembered **explicitly for** its jump scares, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WtDmbr9xyY), [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bieIiX5KLQ), [and this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHYmNrAFlI). 

Or hell, go back to 1925 for *The Phantom of the Opera*, famous for its great jump scare, [the unmasking scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa3bHKWZoJg).

Or look at current movies, like the [cornfield scene in Signs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz3KQgqJgPE), or the [red tent scene in The Sixth Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRAjzK75M0U), or the [the sloth victim in Seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8m69o_1PoQ). Or every single scare in [The Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqVbOSEsJNo). Or the quick cutaway jump scare from The Ring, which I won't link because it freaks me out.

The quality of the movie is inversely proportional to the number of jump scares used? What movies have you been watching? Jump scares are present in the greatest horror movies ever made. 

Now, are they *more* present these days? Possibly. But you can't say jump scares a hallmark of bad horror or lazy directors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly thought *Timecrimes* was a little clinical. It was like a big thought experiment: it holds together really well, but that's all it does. The logic checks out, the paradoxes are taken care of, all the boxes are checked... but the characters and the story don't have much weight. As if the makers were too focused on making sure the time travel element twisted and turned correctly, and neglected the narrative/emotional core. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe you shouldn't have watched 3-4 trailers and new stills and clips, then? It seems like you made that bed yourself. 

And where did this philosophy come from? *I know some (not all) of the major beats of a movie, therefore it's been spoiled*. So, you're just going to remove yourself from seeing it and eating out and talking about the movie and having some fun with friends... because you know too much?

That's kind of a shitty, self-centered attitude, man.

Also, wait: you say you're not going to see the movie in theaters with friends... but you are going to watch it on Netflix with friends? So, *Godzilla* has been ruthlessly spoiled -- though apparently not spoiled enough. It's been $12-ticket-price spoiled, not completely spoiled.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the content is fine; the problem is misinformation. Discussions about the movie industry (e.g. casting choices, project announcements) frequently devolve into *"Hollywood does this / believes this / assumes this / thinks we think this"*, and the argument is simplified into a vague non-point. It's tempting to use "Hollywood" as a catch-all boogeyman for an intricate, complex industry ([examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/search?q=hollywood restrict_sr=on)), but that entity doesn't exist. It's like when anti-gay opponents complain about "the gay agenda", or government critics condense convoluted politics into a game of It's The President's Fault No Matter What.

Or worse, someone asks a question about the business, someone else replies with "$$$", and that's the upvoted answer. No explanation, no analysis; money is the answer to everything, apparently. 

More often than not, the conversation is not discussion -- it's speculation. Except nobody admits they're speculating.

Case in point: the Chris Evans revelation. When the story of his situation first broke, I saw comments calling him whiny, calling him a money-hungry slut, and using the same dismissive logic: *"He has problems? Bullshit, he's rich and he's famous, he can't have problems. He's just whining."* No one here actually knows the inner workings of that situation. Discussing the matter only clouded it, and honest sympathy for Evans was drowned out by the cynical voices.

Who among us really knows how the movie industry works? Not what THR or Vanity Fair reports, not what shows up on Deadline or AICN. I mean like actual, firsthand experience of the business. Without that, /r/movies won't be more than folks standing on soapboxes outside the arena, claiming expertise on the arena's inner workings.

And with that, I'll step down from my anti-soapbox soapbox. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is all subjective, but I'm not the only one who reads the script: most often, I'm the second opinion to the creative executive themselves. 

And I agree, great movies can have flaws, but that's the thing: I wrote that infographic as a list of *flaws*, not a list of *rules*. Those were the areas in which the scripts I read specifically failed, but the same can't be said for **all** scripts. These were just the ones that did it poorly. I didn't make that inforgraphic to teach the hard-and-fast rules of screenwriting; I was simply listing the problems I'd encountered in 300 spec scripts I'd read. That's all they were: problems in *those* scripts, not in *all* scripts. 

I mean, *Glengarry Glen Ross* and *12 Angry Men* have underwritten female parts, and they're masterpieces. If a story is good, if the characters are strong, if the voice is clear, then who cares if it has a few flaws? I don't let the Rules of Writing dictate my verdict on a script. If it's good, it's good, warts and all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That infographic did cover the *recommends*: out of the 300 scripts, 8 got a recommend. 

And there really isn't much to say about *recommend* scripts: they just did everything right. The story was complete and engaging, the characters were strong, the dialogue was smooth, etc, etc. What else is there to say?

There are a lot of ways for a script to go wrong, but only a few ways for a script to go right: everything just *works*. All those flaws I listed? The *recommend* scripts didn't do them, simple as that. 

The truth is, when you're doing coverage, you're not looking for reasons a script is good. You're looking for reasons a script is **bad**, so the production companies can justify passing on it and throwing it in the trash. With millions of dollars at stake, *pass* is the default; *recommend* is the aberration.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would argue that the Joker doesn't represent evil, but rather chaos. He doesn't see himself as a villain; he sees himself as -- like he says -- an agent of chaos, aiming to prove this world isn't as secure as we all pretend it is. *"I'm not a monster... I'm just ahead of the curve."*

Maybe the term "hero of their own story" wasn't the most appropriate for the Joker and Chigurh. But I don't think they see themselves as villains; I think they see themselves as forces of nature, like you say. Not good, nor bad; they just **do** things, just as the Joker says. 

My point in the infographic was, these villains were memorable not because they were trying to be the Villain-with-a-capital-V with smarmy monologues and popcorn psychopathy, but because they were far more complex than an evil cardboard cutout. Great villains are painted in shades of grey, not stark black-and-white. 

Landa, in my opinion, totally believes he's the hero. I mean, come on: he single-handedly ends the War and arranges for the accolades to land on him. He does everything with such control, always gaining the upper hand, that he can't possibly not see himself as the hero. His actions are villainous, but that doesn't mean he doesn't justify them as means to a greater good. </TEXT>

And this was very recent; I posted the infographic in November last year, compiled from scripts I'd read in the twelve months prior, give or take. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually made that infographic, and posted it here first:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1r5y6l/ive_covered_300_spec_scripts_for_5_different/

Context: I read spec scripts and write coverage for a living, and after reading 300 scripts I compiled the data into an infographic.

And there's no "romance" because every romantic script I read was not just a romance, but an extraordinary romance. People don't simply fall in love anymore in scripts; there's always something extraordinary about the circumstances (e.g. *Titanic*, *Benjamin Button*).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it's quite right to pin bad movies on a single bad writer. There is barely a major blockbuster produced in the last twenty years that had only one writer. Those scripts go through a dozen writers, each tweaking and perfecting the story, and very often it becomes a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth: a dozen minds with a dozen ideas results in a messy script. (Off the top of my head, I think *Limitless* was the last big movie that only had one writer, and she had to fight to keep it that way)

So it's not a case of idealistic writers being corrupted, losing their writerly instincts, and churning out shit scripts. It's that studios and companies, understandably, don't want to risk millions on a single person's crazy idea. Studios like a sure thing, and that generally means bringing in more writers, because the assumption is more writers = better script. Sometimes that's the case, sometimes it's not.  </TEXT>

Judd Apatow, Kevin Smith, and Edgar Wright movies also have a good sense of pop culture awareness, but they know a reference in itself isn't funny: there needs to be a punchline. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think there's such a thing as a story that can't be lengthened. It will vary from script to script, but there's always room for something to add. I would suggest looking at short films that were expanded to features: *District 9, Bottle Rocket, Frankenweenie, Mama, THX-1138.*

Maybe it's a side character who can play a bigger role in the story. Maybe it's a plot point that can have complications added to it. Maybe it's an added step in the plot, a Plot Point B to put between Plot Point A and Plot Point C. 

No matter the story, there's always material you can add. The problem is making those additions feel vital, and not like extremities you pasted on to make the script look longer.
