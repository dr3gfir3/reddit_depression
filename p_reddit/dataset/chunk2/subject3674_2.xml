	<TEXT> Background: I was adopted as a baby. My A parents are amazing and I knew from day one that I was adopted. They also gave me free access to my adoption records my entire life. Every few months or years we'd pull out the records and look over them. In my late teens and early twenties, I didn't look at my records for several years but a few years ago my mom, boyfriend, and I looked over them again. I was reminded then that my birth mother herself was adopted, something I had completely forgotten until then. She was a teen when she got pregnant and my B father was out of the picture before I was born. The records indicate that because my B mother had such a positive experience being adopted herself, she felt that it was the right thing to do for me. I have become more curious over the past year or so about my ethnicity, as well as my B parents in general. I am considering taking a DNA test soon and have asked my parents for a copy of my records. 

Now that I've decided to potentially actively pursue finding them or information about them, I have concerns about how my B mother being adopted herself will affect my search. Has anyone else been through a similar situation? How will it affect my search? If I find, for example, a distant cousin on my B mother's side through a DNA test, that person may not even know she exists, for all I know. I don't know whether I'd should seek information about my B mother's B parents or my B mother's A parents or both! It makes things a bit more complicated and I would greatly appreciate any insight you all have to give! </TEXT>
