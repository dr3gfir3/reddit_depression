	<TEXT> I don't think i'm in the 1% for this but I always try to avoid crowds the best I can. When I used to catch busses I would always either have to be at the very front of the line if not I would just wait and get on last to avoid the line. Same with any other sort of crowd i'd rather wait an extra 5 minutes to avoid being in the middle and walk freely, it doesn't have anything to do with anxiety just a personal preference I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say either your laptop can't play high bit-rate (quality) videos or it may have something to do with your SD card. Although VLC is known to play anything you throw at it, maybe try using windows media player. If you can record the clips in 720p and watch it fine then it's probably your laptop that can't handle playing it.
Also just check that the write speed on your SD card is fast enough to support the high quality recording (Samsung cards are usually fine especially if it's the one mentioned on the website)
Goodluck! </TEXT>
