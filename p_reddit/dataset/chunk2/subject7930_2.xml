	<TEXT> I don't think a book that was written by dozens of culturally unique writers over the course of hundreds of years each influenced by the events and circumstances of their times is "very clear" about anything. To apply logic to immaterial and spiritual ideas quickly goes nowhere. I could easily choose to take those words to mean that the Dalai Lama would go to heaven because of his Christ like compassion, and that it would be Jesus who made that concession, thus the Dalai Lama achieved unity with "the father" through Jesus </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Despite what fundamentalists might preach, almost every religion throughout all of history has espoused systems of belief based on emotions and enlightenment and an acknowledgment that the divine is beyond comprehension and renders logic useless. Religion has historically been much more about providing a vehicle for human spirituality rather than providing a strict, unchanging system of theology or doctrine. 

As such, it is perfectly within the capacity of a modern Christian who has chosen following the teachings of Christ as his/her preferred method of spirituality to also have the power of mind to believe that other spiritual pursuits might lead souls to "God". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for saying this. It's really encouraging to read that so many people have come to claim their identity independent of any outside perception, and it gives me hope, but it also left me feeling a little lonely. That outside perceptions is most definitely what makes it hard to be confident in my perceived identity, and leaves me confused when it comes to my own self perception. It's cliche, but amongst my white friends/peers I am the token racial outsider in every comment  in which race is relevant, and amongst my Mexican friends/peers I'm not Latino enough, I'm a gringo. So this leaves me at a loss when I'm alone trying to piece together my own thoughts of who I am or what I can claim as my own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciated La La Land because it didn't go full cliche and have the destinies of the protagonists inevitably intertwine and end in realized romance. The film as a whole left me a bit emotionally disjointed, as it intertwined joyful exuberance with a sense of realistic (and perhaps cynical?) fatalism. However, the more I thought about it the more I felt that the film was simply telling a story and using classic, colorful, nostalgic musical theatre tropes as the medium for telling that story. La La Land is a story about two artists, but the lives of these artists do not present a philosophy of life or art . 

Paterson, on the the other hand, is the story of two artists that also presents a philosophy for art and life. For me it was about finding contentment and joy and art in the mundanity of day to day life. In some ways, it's the antithesis of La La Land. Whereas La La Land takes small moments of beauty and turns them into bombastic, over the top spectacles, Paterson leaves the small moments of beauty exactly as they are, and asks us to be on the look out for these moments precisely because they are small, and if we're not careful we might over look them. 

I'm glad to hear that Paterson holds up under subsequent viewings. I've been trying to convince friends and family to see it with me.  </TEXT>

Around my white friends I am the butt of every racial joke and am asked to translate or explain anything and everything remotely related to any Latino culture, regardless of the fact that I am half Mexican and not half Cuban or Guatemalan or Colombian.

Amongst Latino peers, I am too "white" to be considered Mexican. So I am the butt of most gringo jokes and occasionally get comments like "you really ARE Mexican" when I down a shot of mezcal or whistle cumbia tunes.

 It's the best of both worlds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What left you feeling conflicted? 

And that's a really solid comparison. I think the spirit of the film is what had me leaving the theatre in such a joyful mood. Personally, I've rarely seen films that champion contentment as powerfully as Paterson did. In a culture operating out of an economy of lack, it's refreshing to witness a film that suggests there is plenty all around us if we are willing to look.  </TEXT>
