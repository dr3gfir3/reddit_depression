	<TEXT> I have indeed thought about it. I live in Dublin, Ireland and I am conscious that the bad weather and lack of sunlight may be affecting my mood. My husband and I are currently looking for options in sunnier pastures. Having said that, I am not from Ireland originally and I moved here because I quite like it. Plus I really love my job, although I am at a risk of losing it because I can't get out of bed most days.

About my family, yes, they are far away and I quite like it that way. They would do anything for me and they make me feel very loved, but there are a lot of things I'd rather not share with them. It would only make them unhappy, and there isn't anything they can do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your support. I was subscribed to Suicide Watch for a long time, but I found it was actually counterproductive. Reddit to me means escapism and I don't want to be reminded about my suicidal feelings every time I log in! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The answer to your second question is that I don't think little of what I have at all. I know I am extremely lucky and blessed in many ways.

The answer to your first question is: it makes me want to kill myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it is irrational, selfish and plain stupid. I know that I am ill and it is the depression that makes me feel like this. I know life can be wonderful, but even if I don't value mine there are many things that I can do to help others.

I once read that depression is "when pain exceeds pain-coping mechanisms" and I think that is exactly what happens to me. I can clearly see what is going on with me, but I simply don't have the energy to do anything about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He proposed right after I was diagnosed with clinical depression, so he knew what he was getting into. He knows that I think about it a lot, but I think he's still in denial about how often and how strongly I feel this. He's always there to hug me when I've had a "bad day" and doesn't ask many questions because he knows it's better to let me talk when I'm ready. I don't hide anything from him but I do try to cushion him somehow because it makes him so unhappy...

It has indeed taken a huge toll on him. I can see how powerless he feels every day, how he tries to help in every possible way he can and he fails time after time. I sometimes wonder if he may not be getting depressed himself as a consequence of living with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the two episodes of self-harming that I have had occurred when I was going to the gym every day. Now I don't have the energy for that any more. I have also taken omega-3 with no discernible effects. Nevertheless I think yours is excellent advice, it just didn't work for me. </TEXT>
