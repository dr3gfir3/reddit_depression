	<TEXT> Yes, we are pretty much as confirmed as we can be that Brother Clegane is going to be appearing in some capacity in Season 6. While this solidifies the gravedigger theory from probable to almost certain, it in no way makes the hype machine that is Cleganebowl ^^^^TM any more real than time travelling babies.

I can see that season 6 is shaping up to be great (and not just because we are starting to head into uncharted territory post ADWD), but don't let the butthurt of no Cleganebowl ^^^^TM put a downer on what could be a stellar season.

Sorry to get all parental on /r/asoiaf but it needed to be said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey /r/music

I've fairly recently been listening to lots of Carpenter Bru, Perturbator, Vangelis, MegaDrive and others, but aside from lucking out on youtube and finding videos, and the odd game or movie that has that kind of soundtrack (Hotline Miami, Drive), where can I find more music like this, or can you recommend any other artists for me to listen to?

For those unfamiliar with the style i'm talking about, here are some links to some of my favorite tunes:

Carpeter Bru - Turbo Killer  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er416Ad3R1g

Perturbator - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFi338RFfNw index=3 list=PLrs_KC23dBdNj4oAO8MbOT_dXmgyOEFJi

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I just wondered if anyone had run into any bugs with cooking. I've been messing around (its more fun that way) with cooking but after agges i bit the bullet and looked up some simple looking recipes.

Making fried fish, beer, boiled eggs and a few others, I tried making meat pies with the following ingredients and after looking it up it seems I should have got the discovery.

Lamb x6
Potato Dough x6
Sugar x6
Deep Frying Oil x6

I since got the quest from Olivia and made the boiled eggs, but the next quest is impossible because I can't make Fried Vegetables. (im at cooking beginner lv.9)


Anyone else have this bug? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey fellow Commanders,

I just had this really weird bug on the final mission where aliens would literally do nothing their entire turn. Even finding pods wouldn't cause them to run for cover as they usually do when you find them.

While to be frank that's kinda nice in a weird way when I was just keen to find out what happens at the end, but I've just started Iron Man mode and even though it's a fresh game I still have the same bug.

Does anyone have any other info on this? </TEXT>

1) As Luke discusses with Rey regarding Kylos origins at his academy, the film flashes back to those events and Solo is there with a young Ben.

2) Rey gets another force induced hallucination, where it's revealed or hinted at that she is in fact also Han and Leias daughter, meaning she and Ben are brothers, further compounding the family theme of the Star Wars saga?

	<TEXT> I remember playing this game and really enjoying it although I never finished it and wondered if anyone knew of anything similar but more recent.

For those who don't know, its a Strategy/RPG hybrid where the player controls a team of mech pilots and their crews that help operate their mechs, in an alternate world war 2 setting.

Imagine the movie Fury, with mechs and you'll get the feel of the game's setting and mood.

Anyway, if anyone knows of something like it, or a sequel or something could you let me know?

Heres a video of a review so you can see the kind of game it was:

	<TITLE> (Spoilers All) [Discussion] Robert Baratheons character is the most human story in ASOIAF </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-23 20:03:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I see people talk about Robert Baratheon and how he is a drunk lecherous idiot, but I see a man who has lost his sense of purpose. 

Imagine you loved a woman so deeply who was promised to you, you were prepared to go to war to get her back when she was 'kidnapped'. Read that again like this: you'd be prepared to start a *national civil war* to save her. He didn't grab his best friend Eddard Stark and a few men and go looking for her, he had the *entire country* backing his cause, at the expense of thousands of lives. 

Now imagine working out as this man that the woman you loved who you never got to see alive again was apparently in love with her captor and went willingly. You win the war, and the crown only to have the previous hand of the Kings daughter thrust onto you. At your wedding, you see your bride and wish it was your love. At court your wife speaks but you hear your dead loves voice. 

Robert Baratheon is a man who did everything to get what he wanted only to have it stolen (in his eyes) at the final hurdle with Lyannas death. Think about that for a moment. 

Would you really care if the wife you don't know hates you? Would you care if you beggared the crown anymore? Would you care about fathering untold bastards if you thought a night with a whore might take the pain away, even for just a moment?

You have everything a man could ever want except the person he wanted to share it with. 

Going back to Ned, Robert was supposedly his best friend. Seeing the temperament of Ned and his honourable moral compass do you think he'd associate with a drunken whoring oaf that would tarnish his own honour by association? This makes me think that Robert was an entirely different person when Lyanna was alive. 

I don't see Robert Baratheon as a drunk imbecile, I see a depressed man who has lost his purpose in life, and while his actions towards the end of his life were abhorrent to the outsiders eyes, they are at least somewhat understandable. At least to me. 

So /r/asoiaf, I think Robert is one of the most tragic human characters in the whole of ASOIAF. What do you think about him? Do you disagree?

It seems odd that both the current gen of cosoles have this seemingly basic feature, and Steam doesn't.

More and more often we are seeing people using Fraps and other utilities to record games, I just wondered if people would rather use an inbuilt video recorder in the Steam platform? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Considering it's one of Squares most highly rated games, does anyone think we are likely to see a re-release of Chrono Cross, or a remaster?

It was never released in Europe (UK at least) and I had to import a copy from the States and get my playstation chipped so I could play it, but it still to this day is my favorite Square RPG.

Seeing as we are getting a new FF7, does anyone think we might see a HD re-release? </TEXT>

Seeing as the show has seemingly spoiled that Stannis will lose the battle at winterfell, I think they might have something to do with the liberation of the Stark lands. 

Anyone got any solid theories on what they might do? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys,

I just resubbed today from a lengthy break (I stopped just after The Den of Wolves was released) and was wondering if there is anything I need to know before jumping into Heavensward.

I know there was a housing update, but is there anything else I should know before jumping back in? Or even somewhere that shows a list of all the updates?



Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ###Build Help/Ready:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Please answer here.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Primarily gaming, but I do some heavy photography too. Most gaming rigs should be able to handle some extensive photoshop too, so I don't think I need to specialize towards that.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

1. Longevity/Upgradability
2. Oculus or similar capable

Of course like most I want the highest quality my budget allows for, but if I had to choose, i'm keener on effects as opposed to resolution. I am considering getting a 4K TV to hook it up to along with my Xboxone and PS4, so it'd be nice to exploit that with my PC if it's capable.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I've been looking at PCs from Overclockers between 1500-2000, not dissimilar to: https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=FS-432-OE groupid=43 catid=2475 subcat=2487

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

England, UK

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

Not sure how effeective these parts are, as it's been probably a decade since I built a PC last:

i7 4790K
16GB DDR4 @ 3kMhz
Nvidia GTX 980
500GB SSD -Gaming/Working photography storage
120GB SSD -Operating system
2TB HDD -Generic

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Any help offered would be great in terms of actual components and where to buy from, and I havent got a clue what motherboard I should get :P

Thanks /r/buildapc! </TEXT>

Essentially the guy "finds" a huntsman spider (what on earth would eat the legs and not the spider) and over a few months feeds the spider and it grows its legs back after a molt! I'm very impressed this is even possible over such a short space of time, and thought you 'bro watchers would like to see them also:

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some of you younger truegamers may not remembner it, but Shareware was a word used for games that essentially had a 'try before you buy' mantra where a portion of the game was entirely free (like a demo) and you paid for the rest of the game. Doom for instance was probably the first game I remember playing with a shareware version, although i'm sure that the model is older than that.

In any case, the model disappeared a while back and it seems recently that it is kind of making a comeback if this article is correct:

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Howdy peeps,

I just accepted a bulletin board mission where it asked me to claim 4 bounties in the system. After cruising about for a bit I found an unidentified signal source which dropped me at an npc who said they'd make it worth my while to abandon the mission.  Being the noble soul I am I looked for a way to tell the npc to "stuff it" in the menus but there was no option for that, so I opened fire and killed the scum who was clearly a pirate by his communication log entries. When scanning him though he came up clean.

This netted me a 9200 credit bounty on my head which meant I needed a loan to pay it off when I died. 

What did I do wrong??? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just had a thought while looking at another thread about the Starks, but what if the Stark words literally mean a person called "Winter" is coming? As if prophesizing someone with the name "Winter"s arrival?

Bastards in the books assume their last names from the lands where they are from, so Snow, Stone, Woods, Rivers etc, so what if people from the Lands of Always Winter's bastards are called Winter?

	<TEXT> Don't watch this video if you're trying to romance Iron Bull, or intend to in the future, and double that caution if you're a male inquisitor.

This has to be hands down the funniest conversation i've seen in a Bioware game :P
