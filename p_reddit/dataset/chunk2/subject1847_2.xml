	<TITLE> CEO and business man here to support this theory strictly from an economic perspective. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-02 16:06:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi there.  

So I happened upon this theory when it was first posted to /r/bestof but before it got the wind under its wings.

I'm a 51yo successful business man.  I've founded, built, and sold three companies.  Currently CEO of a software company.  Casual Star Wars fan. 

I enjoyed the original trilogy as a teenager.  I can't say it was "life-changing" but I enjoyed it.  (I was more of a Star Trek guy).  But just like any parent of the OT generation I lined up with my little boys and their friends for the prequels. Man was I disappointed and no disappointment flowed more than from watching that wretched Jar Jar Binks.

My boys grew up thinking the prequels were amazing (along with Clone Wars).  I personally just couldn't give two craps.

But then this theory.  It totally floored me.  Not because of the SW minutia.  I get many of you live and breath Star Wars.  But I think there is a large population out there like me.  We remember it fondly and yet believe the prequels were silly, badly acted movies.

Enter Disney.  Now if I am anything, it is a huge comic nerd.  Make Mine Marvel.  I've watched with glee as Disney has transformed my childhood dreams into fantastic movies exactly as I imagined them.  

And then they bought Lucasfilm.  As a business man I simply looked at the price and thought, damn - that's going to be a very nice deal for them.  I had seen how they could exploit acquired IP with Marvel.  So the real question here was how could they exploit the existing library of content while deriving future value by creating new content.

Everyone has been focused on the future - new SW movies every other year with anthology releases between.  Awesome!

But now this theory uncovers a scheme so brilliant that even the Emperor would bow to it.

I don't yet believe that this theory is something that Lucas truly dreamed up in depth.  I think there are kernels of truth to his original plans to make Jar Jar something bigger in the prequels.  But the big, big bad?  I'm not sold that Lucas really thought that far ahead, planned it, abandoned it, and then never spoke of it ever again.

Disney?  That's a different story.  So I just bought 4b worth of IP.  The OT is gold - mined over and over in every possible format.  The prequels are the red-headed stepchild.  How do you make more money from them?

If this theory turns out to be correct Disney will have successfully turned one of the most historic franchises ever into a multi-decade "The Sixth Sense".  Everyone with even a passing interest in SW will go back and watch from the beginning to see how they could have possible missed this.

Investment tip: Buy Disney (DIS).  On its own it is a nice long-term stock to hold.  But imagine if this theory is correct.  A booked asset they they hold will rapidly rise in value.  Not a very risky bet to make. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can someone help with some questions I have about 4" PVC drainage pipe? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-29 14:17:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am building a large natural swim pond.  I have made some mistakes along the way and am learning as I go.

I am in the process of "reversing" my pump system because I didn't really understand the limits of "pushing water" vs. "pulling water".

I have a very high-capacity waterfall pump (17,500GPH).  I buried 4" PVC drainage pipe below the water level from one end of the pond back around behind the waterfall on the other end.   I immediately saw the flaw in my logic because when I started the pump it almost immediately became "water starved".  Effectively it was pushing water more quickly from the holding cistern than the 4" input pipe could supply more water.  Well shit!

So now I am going to need to reverse my thought process and run 220v to the other end and move the cistern down there so that water is pumped from the main pond down to the other end to run the waterfall.

Here's my question.  The pipe I buried is 4" PVC drainage pipe that is stamped "not for pressure".  Since I was using it to "pull" or "draft" water before I didn't see this as an issue.  The outflow from the pump is 3" PVC.  So reversed the pump will outflow at 3" with a ball valve.  Then it will expand to the 4".

Now when I reverse it, I still don't believe there will be "pressure" since the pipe is not constrained - it runs along the pond and then is open at the end feeding the waterfall.  The only pressure would be caused by the 10' climb to the waterfall head.

So my questions:

- Does anyone see a "pressure" issue that I should be concerned about regarding the integrity of this pipe?
- I do have two 90 degree turns along the pipe path.  Pushing water through those turns now do you think that would cause me any pipe integrity issues?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello /r/assistance[1] . I've always enjoyed this sub and have tried to help as many people as I can. Now I need your help!

Trey Mills is 4 years old. He was born with a rare overgrowth syndrome called Proteus. There have been only 200 known cases of Proteus Syndrome in the world. The overgrowth can cause differences in the appearance and growth rate of various body parts and is typically asymmetrical, meaning it does not affect corresponding body parts similarly. In Treys case, it has affected the entire left side of his body  inside and out. Because of this,Trey has had both his left leg and left ring finger amputated.

In his short lifetime, Trey has endured over 400 doctor appointments, 16 sedations and nine surgeries. Every three to four months, Trey undergoes a complete internal MRI to determine if his internal organs are growing. In July, Trey was diagnosed with severe lung disease and is currently waiting to go on the double lung transplant list in Missouri. - A link to his facebook account for those that want to follow: https://www.facebook.com/HopeForTrey?fref=nf[2]

We are working with Scarborough   Friends Foundation to sponsor a charity golf tournament with all proceeds going to Trey and his family. If you happen to live in the Atlanta area and would like to field a team, please follow the link at the bottom of this page.
On that page you can also donate directly to Trey's cause using the Donate button.

Additionally, we are raffling off a custom Hulk Chopper (http://i.imgur.com/W59mHmL.jpg [3] ). You can purchase raffle tickets from the web page as well.
Thanks in advance for your generosity and support!

	<TITLE> Can anyone help me figure out what issue of the Incredible Hulk I am thinking of? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-20 20:14:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Background: I was born in 1964.  When I was young my dad would take my brother and me to the barber to get our hair cut.  The barber had some old comics.  Those were the first comics I ever read.  I can't tell you how old I was but it had to have been in the early 70's.  I know that I was into comics by the mid-70's because I distinctly remember buying the Uncanny X-men when it relaunched in 1975-6.

I don't think the image I am remembering was a cover - I have looked through a library of hulk covers and don't see anything like it - so I think it was most likely an opening inside "splash page".

It had bruce banner washing up on an ocean shore obviously recovering from a transformation from the hulk.  I can't remember much more but I remember him on his hands and knees crawling from the surf.

Any big Hulk fans out there that might know which issue I am thinking of?  I would like to find this issue and add it to my collection since it was the first comic I ever remember.

Bonus: I also recall back-bin comics from a drug store where they would cut off half of the front cover and sell them for a nickel.  There was a daredevil one where he is throwing away his sunglasses (or something else  - I can't remember) in a trash can.  I didn't know who Daredevil was at the time so I didn't realize he was blind.  I just remember his sunglasses I thought were cool.  I would love help finding that one too if anyone recalls it.

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-29 20:39:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I purchased a 12 x 2.5 ft slab of walnut that is about 3 inches thick.  I am planning to use it as a vanity top in my master bath.

It was aged outside in a free-air stack under about 5 other layers of slabs.

Now that I have had it for a month or so laying in my addition I notice that it has a slight warp across the depth of the slab - no more than 1/4 inch.

What is going to be the easiest way for me to level the side that will be up?  The cabinets will be custom built so I figure I can adjust the top of the cabinets to accommodate the warp on the bottom side.  But on the top side - how can I level it?  Would it be better to sand this or plane it?  Any other ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see a lot of scams in business but this one was a bit too well done in my opinion.  I could easily see a smaller company that doesn't have good financial controls in place falling for this.

With sites like linkedin it is pretty easy today to figure out who an authorized executive is at a company and who runs finance.  A little legwork will get you the naming convention for the email addresses.

This email was sent to our director of finance yesterday: http://i.imgur.com/7Nwn9gt.png

It was was spoofed to look like it came from the president and included a mocked up chain of emails where he agrees to a wire apparently.

Luckily we have procedures that require the wire be signed off on by an executive or I could easily see a wire flying out the door. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-02-17 20:39:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello.

I had some beams from an 1840's cotton mill cut into planks that I plan to use on my outside porch ceilings. 

These porches are covered so they are not directly exposed to sun nor rain.

I have the same boards down throughout the house for flooring and those are being finished with just wax to highlight the grain and color.  I would like the outside ceiling to do the same but I am concerned that even out of the elements it might need a more substantial finish but I really want it to be as natural as possible.

Anyone have experience finishing heart pine in this or a similar situation?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the /r/bestof linked post: http://np.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/2uo1cf/update_on_the_hulk_chopper_i_won_in_a_charity/

The charity is Scarborough and Friends. http://scarboroughfoundation.org/

I have always enjoyed donating to charities where you know that every penny is going to help people. Sam's transparency let's you see exactly who is in need of help and how your donation is changing their lives.

That said, when Sam brought the chopper to my office he let me know that he and his wife are ending the foundation after this year. Here's an article in the local newspaper about it: http://imgur.com/mDIUXFj 

The reason they are ending the foundation is that with a charity this closely focused on the actual recipients the emotional toll was just becoming too great. They lost a sweet little 5-year-old girl this past November and it hit them very hard.

I have tried to talk to him about continuing the foundation but stepping back enough to not get so emotionally attached - because you are going to lose a few. It's just the odds.
More important I think is looking at how many people you are helping overall.

If you guys could, please visit the foundation's website above. Even if you can't donate it would be great if you could hit the "contact us" button and send Sam a nice note letting know what a great job he is doing and encourage him to keep going!

Thanks for listening. Hug him gently Reddit! :) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have perused the interwebs and see quite a few horror stories.

Here's my situation, and first of all I am not a "woodsmith".  I am a "learn as you go" kind of guy and I am more than willing and happy to make mistakes and learn.

That said, I am wanting to do a 12' vanity top in the master bathroom I am building.  I want it to be done from a single slab of wood about 4" deep with a live edge.  The plan would be to carve or router out the two basins directly in the wood as shallow sinks that will drain directly down a throat through the bottom down to the U trap.

I have a lot of land and some very large trees to pick from.  Species I have that would be large enough are pine, oak, poplar, sweet gum, and *possibly* maple (although I haven't seen one big enough yet while walking the woods - I might find one).

The sweet gum wood I've seen is very beautiful and I'm really leaning that way over the oak.  The poplar and pine are just too soft I'm thinking.  

Has anyone ever slabbed a 4" or larger slab from a sweet gum?  Can you share your experiences if so?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have a large propane tank in the yard that used to be used for the house.  We switched over everything to electric and called the gas company to come pick up the tank - fully expecting that they would credit us back for the remaining propane in the tank. 

Instead they told us they can't take back propane but charge $85/hour to empty the tank.  If I didn't know better I would say they are a subsidiary of Comcast.

What is the safest way for me to vent/release the gas myself?  Is there a safe way to do it? </TEXT>

It's a big boat and there are only 20 or so people going so I thought it might be fun to try to find a few redditors that might be in Cancun then that might like to enjoy with us.
