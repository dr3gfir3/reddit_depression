	<TEXT> Medium is a great place to start blogging as it will help you focus on writing and creating great content. But your blog will not have an individual look and feel and if you are thinking of later building it into a monetizable blog, then Wordpress is a better option. But writing is super easy on Medium and everything look great with the least amount of effort.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely understand what you mean. First things first. What kind of blog are u thinking about? Is it along the lifestyle genres of travel, food etc which is design heavy? If it is design/ image oriented, I would strongly suggest you use Wordpress. And to begin with, use the free version. You can always migrate content if you decide to move to an individual domain. 

 nbsp;


The biggest issue with blogger is what you worry about, that it could pull the plug on you. It's happened to me because someone had raised a complaint and the person who had an issue had mistaken my blog for another or some such thing But having said that, you can also request for your blog to be reinstated, but it is rather tedious. now with Wordpress, even the free one
*You get access a lot of customisation options
*Far more themes available
* and contrary to popular opinion, very easy to use.

 nbsp;

But the negatives with the free version are that you can't do Adsense integration and you can't add a huge range of widgets and plugins (like SEO related stuff). But that's just content creation. You will have to also think about marketing and traffic building once you have a few posts up. All the best!  </TEXT>
