	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply-I did call my doctor and she said pretty much what you just did. Its totally normal at my age and not to worry. I am due my yearly in October so I wont see them until then. She did say they would be concerned if it was the opposite, heavy and longer periods. But I am glad I called just for the piece of mind!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a healthy 49 year old who is now 73 days late for my period. (no chance of being pregnant) Other than being late no other symptoms of peri-menopause that I can think of. I have always been pretty regular until now. I am due for my yearly in October but should I go now? Thanks!!  </TEXT>
