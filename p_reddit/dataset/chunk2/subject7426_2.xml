	<TEXT> Birdshit! God, sometimes I lay in bed at night and recall this specific scene from HoC while having a sensible chuckle. This was a great moment of levity in that book, and one of the best moments of levity I've read thus far in the series. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wasn't going to initially, but after reading that DoD has some major spoilers for RotCG I decided to pepper them in. If I understand correctly, they are a bit quicker to read so it will be a nice break from the dense nature of the main series. I'm going to read NoK before starting the second half of the series because I felt like it would be a good tie-back to the prologue of GotM. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> MT: Turning the first page of part 4, or how I felt my heart quicken </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Being on the fifth book of the core series, I've fallen into SE's pattern of all plot threads and action building to the fourth section of each book. MT has been a roller coaster and one that has set a new benchmark for me. I also just remembered it's Labor Day weekend so now I'm frantically counting down the hours until I can go home and read what I expect to be a thrilling and yet another epic conclusion.

With all due luck and time on my side, that should leave me with just enough time to plow through most of NoK before returning to work on Tuesday...

To speak a little on MT and just how freakin' awesome this it (and also why, despite some recent conversations on this subreddit, this is a great fifth book and not first book of the series) I've really felt so many of the disparate elements of the series thus far being stitched together.  The Crippled God is finally dragged into the foray and is the most active we've seen him in any of the books thus far. The Tiste Edur are also spotlighted as well as the nature of their fragmented warren. Everything with the Nascent and Silandra are coming together, the First Empire is touched on more deeply here than even in Deadhouse Gates (though a reread post-finishing the series may change that) and we finally meet members of the Crimson Guard. Who, by the way, are awesome.

Everything I've listed above (in my ramshackle manner) has been briefly mentioned or touched on in the series before but MT acts a a big, glorious/gory-ous ribbon cinching them all into the main plot. This is the convergence of convergences for the first five books and I'm excited as hell to read what the last five have to offer.

Finally, because I haven't touched on Tehol and Bugg yet (due to them being new but hopefully long-lasting players in the series...cough cough I have my eye on Bugg - if that's his real name!) let me just say they are freaking awesome. At first, while starting MT, I found the Tiste Edur/Seren sections a bit of a drag and I wanted to get back to the hilarious banter and intrigue of the notorious duo. The rest of the characters and arcs caught up with them in terms awesomeness but Tehol and Bugg (as well as Rucket and Shurq) are some of the best characters SE has written up to this point. 

Anyway, enough with my rambling. Carry on with your regularly scheduled Friday afternoon activities. Nothing to see here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's about how I feel - "Hooray, more Malazan!"  Meanwhile, my boyfriend is thinking "Hooray, another night he stays up reading while I go to bed alone..."

I digress! I plan on reading NoK after I finish MT then read RotCG and SW between TtH and DoD. Then I'll insert OST between DoD and tCG. I was hoping to wrap this series up in a year, but it looks like it'll take a bit longer than I'd expected.

Again, I regret nothing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...but then I did. I broke down today and ordered the first couple Esslemont books from Amazon. I was initially planning to wait until after the core series to read them but then I read that DoD has major spoilers for RotCG. Me being the lover of surprises and not-knowing-what's-coming that I am decided to insert RotCG into my readthrough of the series.

And then I said to myself "Well, it IS book two...so I'll pick up Night of Knives right now too!" This then quickly transformed into "Well, the last two come after tCG, so I guess I'll just insert books three and four into my read-through as well!" I'm working through MT right now and was starting to feel excited for reaching the halfway point in the series. Now I'm just weeping softly in a corner surrounded by all the Malazan books...

I have no regrets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also feel at this point almost all of the main characters (from the Seven Cities and Genabackis arcs) have been introduces and the setting is familiar. And you're four books into the world building and things are starting to click into place. Which makes me excited for the next book...time to shake things up again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! I figured I'd just wantonly combined them when things started to contradict one another.  I shall indeed read on - I am blowing through HoC. Somehow this was a much quicker read than the previous three volumes...probably due to Karsa's section at the beginning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm reading HoC and just read Cutter and Apsalar's discussion of Shadowthrone and Cotillion's possible motives with the Shadow Throne on Drift Avalii. Skip forward about 20 pages and Trull Sengar and Monock Ochem are talking about the First Throne and they made it sound as if it was situated on Drift Avalii. I'm guessing that I'm just compartmentalizing these two thrones into one, but are they indeed separate thrones?  I have not finished HoC yet, so keep spoilers through the conversation with Monock and Trull.  Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Spoilers GotM - MoI] Crowd sourcing a tattoo idea! No spoilers past MoI, please. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Howdy y'all. I'm in the market for a new tattoo and want to get a simple, clean symbol from the Malazan universe done on my right calf. I currently have the Triforce on my left calf (very basic, thick, clean lines with none of the adorning bells and whistles) and want to balance it out with some sort of symbol from the Malazan universe.

I've only read through MoI (I'm working on HoC right now) so please do not post any ideas that would spoil events later in the series for me. However, if you think of a really good one from a book I haven't read, please let me know that I need to keep reading. I'll visit this post once I've finished that book to hit you up for your idea.

THIS IS WHERE I GET SPOILERY, BUT I MARKED IT IN THE TITLE SO I'M NOT GOING TO TAG IT HERE.

As for my personal journey with the series thus far, I love Duiker (and thusly loved the epilogue of MoI). Ganoes is also one of my faves, as was Detoran (though don't we just love all the Bridgeburners?). The Chain of Dogs really effed me up, as did all of Coral but it was bloody fantastic.

Anyway, thanks in advance and if you could post a image with your post that'd be super duper! </TEXT>
