	<TEXT> Your fixation with her orgasm is making it harder for her to orgasm. The reason she orgasms so little is most probably because you are putting so much pressure on her, to the point of bringing her to tears. If you were to just have sex with no hopes or expectations for her to orgasm I bet it would happen far more often. In short get over yourself mate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look I've said this before, having sex for the first time for me (owner of a vagina) was difficult, I was tense at first so felt really tight and my BF at the time couldn't get it in. He was really sweet and cuddled me and we fell asleep and made a plan to try again the next week. But when it worked it was like ripping off a bandaid.

When we tried again, I took control, I went down on him, I initiated 69, I showed him what I liked or thought I did since I'd never tried it before. When it came to PIV, it hurt, but it didn't require any stretching, I was wet see, and the actual penetration thing, it was like ripping off a bandaid, a little fear and a little resistance and then it's done. You are so worried about it hurting because of all the bullshit you hear about it, but once it was in it was in and cue multiple orgasms. Just do the foreplay stuff and help her relax when it comes to the deed. By all means finger her, not for any clinical type stretching purpose but because it's fun for you to pleasure her and get her nice and wet and help her orgasm. The hymen is actually meant to tear. </TEXT>

I had a party recently and got a text from a guest the next day saying sorry they couldn't make it. People are so used to having you around they don't grasp the enormity of your moving away but then the reality sinks in that they're not gonna see you for a really really long time and then they panic, and guilt you, because of course it's your fault they're pikers. 

I agree with the others here, get em in to help you pack. And ask them to bring snacks. And good luck on your move!!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly, we love big brother right? 

I still fail to see how it's related, the recommendations of the board were in relation to film where the participants appear to be underage. OP didn't say she was attracted to underage boys, she said she was attracted to of-age men who aren't showing the outwards signs of masculinisation (like a beard for example). I don't see that there's any comparison since of-age women typically don't change an awful lot between the end of puberty and first pregnancy. A lot of people are saying that if a guy had a similar preference he would be a social pariah, but how many elderly millionaires do you see marrying girls a third their age?  It's not a strong argument. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see what you're trying to say, but it's probably not the best example, even though it seems to prove your point. The board supposedly represents the cannon of good taste but in reality is ridiculously conservative, paternalistic and not at all representative of our tastes as individuals. Generally there is a lot of protest when the board decides to ban or censor a film or video game.

	<TEXT> I don't have any real experience with this but my take on it is that it's about the "daddy" being a more knowledgeable, bigger, more experienced and safe figure guiding the smaller person through their exploration of their own sexuality? I might be wrong, and I could get into psychology and attachment stuff, but that's how I've always seen it without having experienced it. I haven't ever thought it was in any way incestuous, but more like someone guiding another person.

Boom, I saw stars, my hands and feet were numb and tingly. Then I lost it, probably with a lack of opportunity but the next time after that I was probably 21, I was on top facing him, in an almost back bend position with my hands on his knees, grinding, but with him thrusting and bouncing me, he hardened and tightened as he was about to go and it obvs rubbed the right place, and boom, I was in full backbend before I knew where I was, seeing stars again and not able to feel my extremities. He was gracious about the backbend part, but I think it may have been slightly uncomfortable. </TEXT>

He's also not big on romantic gestures or PDAs. But he does a lot of other things to show his love for me, like household chores and buying me tickets to concerts I want to go to.

	<TEXT> The hole near the top would be smaller, that's your urethra, that's where the urine comes out when you wee. The one near the bottom of your vulva is your vaginal opening.  That's where you would put your finger if you wanted to.

Most women will also rub their clitoris when they masturbate. That's the part at the top near the apex of the vulva, above the urethra, it's a very sensitive bud of flesh covered by a hood of skin. It feels really nice to rub this and also to insert a finger and rub inside the vaginal opening at the front. You can eventually get up a rhythm that will lead you to orgasm. But every woman and man masturbates differently so just spend some time experimenting and you should find your best way to orgasm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reprehensible is a very loaded word. I post pictures of my Father on Facebook all the time, or share his posts that come up on my "on this day" thing, because a lot of my friends knew and loved him and its a way of keeping some part of his essence alive. To show that he was here, at least for a time, and now he is gone, but never forgotten. Its not for the likes at all, but to remind everyone what a great dude he was and that he had a great sense of humour.

I would guess that your husband is just grieving and more sensitive right now than usual, but offloading that grief on you by calling you names is not OK. Its gaslighting, its made you question your own perception and doubt yourself. He should not ascribe motive to your actions as u/raziphel says. 

I know what I would do in this situation, but I wouldn't presume to know the best way for you to handle it. Good luck and PM me if you want someone to talk to about your poor little kitty.

We have sex rather infrequently but when we do it's quite full on, and I always take this slump the next day as a sign that he is ashamed or embarrassed by our lovemaking and letting himself go. I probably feel this way because of my own hang ups related to constant rejection. I'n interested to see if anybody has solutions to this. </TEXT>

Men are allowed to be as crass as they like, women can be, to a point, but when it comes to discussing what's really important like pleasure and orgasms, it's suddenly too much.

	<TEXT> And that's fair enough. I guess my point was that you don't expect it from women, particularly close friends, like you do from men, so it hurts more and makes you question wether you really are a slut.

	<TEXT> Oh yeah. I should probably not talk about it at all. It's not ladylike. But like I said, with these girls we are often very candid, they're all quite out there, we often talk about this stuff. So I was surprised. In more reserved circles the conversation would never have come up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm maybe I shouldn't put it out there anymore. But at the same time I get frustrated that I have to stay quiet about my sexuality. We were out at clubs where dudes were practically waving their dicks around and that's totally accepted. 

It wasn't as if I just out of context started telling everyone masturbation stories haha I'm o my a slight exhibitionist. It was in the context of the conversation, we were talking about how often we all have sex with our partners and how good/bad the sex is. Me and this bunch of girls are often very candid with each other. I said that I don't have sex nearly as often as I would like but that it's ok as I masturbate to keep myself sane. The question about frequency came up and I said daily, before work as I know it's the best I'm going to feel all day. It's a form of self care to me. And then the Nympho question came up. Maybe there is something wrong with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could very well be. I didn't feel as if I was being attacked in any way though, as if she was taking out frustrations on me. It was really that word that upset me and made me wonder, am I the only one who finds that offensive? Is that the way people really feel about someone who is open and honest about their sexuality? I would have thought that post "sex and the city" these kinds of attitudes would be old fashioned and the fact that people still feel that way makes me wonder if there really is something wrong with me - and does that mean my husband is normal and I'm not, and thus have no right to be upset with our current frequency?

	<TEXT> I like that! I consider myself gifted also, surely being multi-orgasmic counts for something. I've accepted it too, and would have thought that it would be a total non-issue in 2016, but horrible words like nympho still work their way into the conversation. I'm going to have to work in having a thicker skin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes thanks. It's the feeling alone part that sucks the most. I actually thought that my friends were quite accepting, and I am less inhibited around them than I would normally be with other women, but that old puritanical stuff worked its way in there.

Thanks for the hugs and high fives. I get low about it a bit. It's good to know I'm not alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't worry, one time I was with some friends in a hotel room and my best friend was making out with this girl, she got up to go to the bathroom and he told me that he had blown his load already into the curtain and was like "What do I do? She was teasing me so much and I can't keep going?" So I was like "Pretend you're asleep I'll create a diversion". So when she comes out I drunkenly make her a cup of tea and tell her my life story until she climbs into bed and passes out. Cause that's what friends do. She told him the next day that she knew but just didn't know how or wether to stop right then as she was a bit inexperienced and didn't want him to think it freaked her out. It was no big deal until he made it a big deal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Outlander, it's based on a book by Diana Gabaldon and the sex in the book is by far the most accurate portrayal I've ever read. In the television series they don't shy away from anything, there's a lot of nudity and very realistic and sensual portrayal of sex, foreplay, affection, birth and even sadism and degradation (that part is hard to watch)

I don't know your wife but I do know the books and the show have a massive female fan base who are utterly devoted to the male protagonist in the book (and TV show) so all those millions of women can't be wrong. I just like that it's a beautiful romance, but it doesn't cut off once they get into bed, or just show their silhouettes etc. if he's fingering her, well you might not see the act, but you see their reactions, or if she's going down on him or he's licking her or whatever. It's very sexy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not actually "smell" per se. The smell is the visceral thing that you can pinpoint and go "Yeah, that's it" but in reality it's pheromones that are consciously imperceptible but that you are picking up on along with the smell. And women have a much better sense of smell than men, I think evolution has done this to ensure that we have babies with those whose immune systems are compatible. But long story short, a woman may feel that something is "off" about a man's smell, but it's not the smell, just all that other information that can be picked up that way. I mean, it could be a really stinky guy, but if they're compatible he'll smell great to her. </TEXT>

I mean if he went through your computer and found lots of photos of some hot shirtless dude you're into, would he feel the need to post to r/sex asking wether it's normal that you're so into Prince Charles or Justin Bieber or Bukkake or Luke Perry or whatever.

Relax. And maybe get a pedicure. </TEXT>
