	<TEXT> The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes.


I feel like a bad person but I fucking lost it there. Shoes? Why shoes? I mean, I can understand fishing gear but are shoes really the next largest and most common trash in the sea? Really?! </TEXT>

Ninja edit: also, why the 'this woman' and 'this fiancee'? Sounds really stony and distant. Especially since you told him shes not right for him, I am getting some subtle dislike coming from you towards her.  </TEXT>

That may be holiday-bias though, sometimes the mineral composition is different to back home and they just tell you not to so you can avoid upset stomach for the first few days of your trip whilst you adjust. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There were thousands of people outside the stadium. When they opened more gates to let more in, they flooded in without realising the capacity was filled. On the inside, people terrified and being crushed, on the outside, fans eager to get into the stadium because the game had already started. The police were trying to prevent fans climbing onto the pitch, and there were no police horses in the stadium to direct crowd flow into the adjacent pens. It was a massive failure on the part of the police to manage the crowd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because there's a vast amount more guys that play compared to girls. When you have a bigger pool to pull from, you will get more talent. If you have a very small number of girls relatively, you won't find enough talent to form the same number of pro teams.

I imagine if CS:GO players were an even 50:50 split male to female ratio, you'd see some female teams up there in the top 20 too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of it I assume is doctors feeling so many they have a point of reference and experience of a healthy prostate vs. an unhealthy one. Even if you thought yours was fine and it wasn't, how would you know? Also I think its difficulr to reach your own unless you're quite flexible, and the age range of men most at risk (50+) possibly aren't that flexible. </TEXT>
