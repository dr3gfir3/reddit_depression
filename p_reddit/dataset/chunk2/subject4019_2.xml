	<TEXT> he Reds

     The Reds are a vicious and violent group. They kill and attack anyone and everyone. They are easily spotted by their bandannas soaked in their enemies blood (thus they are called the Reds.) Because their bandannas arent naturally red, they have to kill often to keep their bandannas red. They come from the South. They arent a race per se, theyre more of a gang.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In my personal opinion, I think a live DB\DBZ movie would be awesome if done well. I mean, [look at these guys!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opji5DgE_nQ) They are indie and they made a great live action rendition! There's got to be someone out there who can do these series justice. If we do get a Dragon Ball movie, I personally think it should be at least a trilogy because there's just too much to stuff into one movie. What do you think? </TEXT>

I wrote on Twitter about how said and mad I was and a half hour later it says "SINGLE ." Am I over thinking this? Before today it always said she was single.

By the way she posts when I do. THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE, IT'S HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES. When I post, she posts. She also only posts the amount of pictures I post. So if I only posted one, she only posts one.

3. How quickly did the Norse intermarry and assimilate with the Gallo-Romans? Did they move their families from Scandinavia?
4. Did the Normans feel kinship between the Norse\Vikings\Danes?
5. How long did Old Norse last in Normandy? Did the aristocricy attempt to learn Old Norse.
6. Did the Scandinavians have any cultural impact on the natives?
7. How did the Franks feel about the settlers? 
8. Aren't all Normans "Vikings" since the word comes from "Vikingr" which means "to go raiding". The Normans did plenty of that.
9. Did the Normans feel different from the native Frankish\Gallo-Roman population? 

Sorry if this is a lot of questions, I'm just fascinated by the Normans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I'd like to point out that my grammar isn't the greatest. That being said, I believe it's fairly accurate. If my grammar is not accurate, POLITELY tell me what I've done wrong so I don't make those mistakes again. With that being said, let's get on to the rant. I don't understand why people do not use correct grammar and spelling. One: YOU HAVE AUTO-CORRECT (although, it does not catch some grammar mistakes). Two: Don't these people who use incorrect grammar and spelling know that if you write correctly it eases communication? I believe laziness has something to do with it. I mean, how difficult is it to write "you" instead "u"? I'm baffled by this sudden urge to use incorrect grammar and spelling. Although, maybe it's just pure ignorance. Anyways, this concludes the end of my rant. I apologize for it's length; I'm just very passionate about English. Is there anyone else out there who agrees with me? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently in the process of learning French. All though I'd love to go to France, that's not the main reason I'm learning the language. I'm learning the language because I find it very fascinating; It's a great mix of the Celtic language of Gaul and Latin (If that is incorrect, please pardon me) and I haven't seen a Romance language like it. I know this is long, please bear with me. Now to the question: When I visit France one day, will the natives be mad when I pronounce French bad? Not on purpose of course. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-22 14:38:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For example: English lost it's grammatical gender cases, declensions died out, and English adjectives never change. They change in other Germanic languages and all Romance and Slavic languages. I've even heard some people say that English is "a string of words put together". More example: we have a huge lack of morphology, Nothing connects words in English. We also have a written alphabet that compares no correlation to how it sounds, and a system of spelling that Dan Brown couldn't decipher. Albeit, those last two didn't have much to do with grammar, I just wanted to point them out.

EDIT: Sorry about the punctuation error in the tittle, I was in a hurry. </TEXT>
