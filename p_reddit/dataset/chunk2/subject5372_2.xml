The data was downloaded from [American Fact Finder](http://factfinder.census.gov/). It is found under Table S2701, of the 2014 1 Year Estimates. It is important to note that the numbers do not total to the population because a person can have more than 1 type of insurance.

After the data was acquired, it was cleaned in excel. The visualization was then created in Tableau.

	<TEXT> I was surprised at first too, but when I started looking at some of the data for it state it started to make sense. 

That states with higher "wireless only" numbers are states with younger median ages and states where there is more poverty.  I would guess younger people are more likely to have mobile only and more impoverished people are most likely getting subsidies for wireless phones that they can't get for landlines. 

In the Northeast you have a wealthier and older population. They are more likely to be able to afford both or because they are older they just have the landline. 

That's my guess only using basic demographic assumptions. </TEXT>

I think that this exists though at least in the mind of some reporters. It may even help add fuel to the fire that more profit driven members of the MSM are hoping for.

	<TEXT> u/asparagus63 is it possible to get the data source and tool as requested in the posting rules?

I am curious about some of the results, especially with Mormons. It is weird that Mormons are so accepting of animal cloning, but not cloning humans. My guess is that it has to do with the fact that Mormons believe some people will eventually be given the power to create life, but I am wondering if methodology may be swaying the numbers.

If this is just a simple yes no than that result is the result, but if it is done with a likert scale there may be a story this visualization doesn't show. </TEXT>

The first is United States Department of Transportation, which published a table containing the number of registered vehicle every year since 1990. The second data source is the Populations Estimates Program which is completed by the US Census Bureau. The estimate date of July 1st of each year was used since that is the date that is referenced in current tables.

After I found the data, I copied it into Excel and performed the per capita calculation. I then copied the data into a visualization creator at statpedia.com The site creates and hosts the data visualization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not exactly sure why this is. My theory is that it is a weighting issue with the public microdata that the Census provides. 

Since their are privacy concerns, the Census only provides a partial sample of the data they collect in the micro data. They then apply a weight to each case so you can create national estimates. With small groups though there are issues with that though. Small groups can have issues where the estimate does not reflect what is actually occurring. I am sure the census tests some groups to make sure they are extremely accurate, but I don't think they looked at the population of 94 year olds.  

Since I am not certain about it I decided to go ahead and publish the visualization as is.

	<TEXT> Edit: I posted this but I think it wasn't sent as a reply. If it was my bad.

I called it a custom tab because I put it together using the 10 years of ACS data so it doesn't match exactly because the PUMs data isn't an exact replica of ACS data. You can't see all ten years of data because of the tableau public row limit though. I didn't use the tables because I find it a pain to combine each year now that I have them combined Housing PUMs.

 I do have some SAS experience and that is what initially turned me on to WPS. I have only used it for about three weeks because it's a trial, but it seems to get the job done. It seems like their are some project options that are better than SAS if you want to do a large project, but I haven't gotten a chance to explore them.

My biggest complaint is the performance time and the cost. It seems to run a lot slower than SAS. That may be my computers fault compared to what I have at work. The cost I got quoted was 1300 ish a year which wouldn't be bad if I was trying to replace SAS, but for my on the side data visuals there is no way I can afford that.

	<TEXT> It's nicer, but they aren't as mutually exclusive as you would think. Lodi separates itself from Stockton by maintaining "greenbelt" compriesed of farmland and the zoo. What ends up happening though is that Lodi doesn't have very much recreation or large businesses so you have to go to Stockton. Also, the community college is in Stockton so you either have to drive or make a bus trip that is nearly undo-able due to the length and regularity of the bus system. Crime from Stockton has started to creep up into Lodi.

TLDR: Lodi is a lot nicer than Stockton, but they aren't as separated as you would think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well if you want the data here it is...

Median Household Income 

US Average - $53,482

White - $56,900

Black or African American - $35,600

American Indian and Alaska Native $37,170

Asian - $73,244

Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander - $53,370

Some other race - $40,300

Two or more races - $47,621

Hispanic or Latino - $42,396

I'm too lazy to write up all the educational attainment info for each race because it is on different data tables, but 18.3% of the total population has a bachelor's degree and 11% has a graduate degree. About 29.7% of Asian Americans have a bachelor's degree and 21.8% have earned a graduate or professional degree
All of this data is published by the US Census Bureau on americanfactfinder.gov . The income info is on Table S1903 and the educational data is table B15002d and S1501.
