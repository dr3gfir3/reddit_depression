He went in the garage and brought out a supersoaker that he apparently filled with gasoline and hosed me down, drenching my winter coat. I knew it was bad but only now realize how bad it could have been. I went inside to tell his chain smoking parents, they flipped out and immediately got me some new clothes, thankfully I didn't ignite! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lee's accent in the series is closer Elmer Fudd than being Russian, at least Marina is plausible. I feel like yellow card man was just added for an extra supernatural effect, especially showing up in the hospital to mess with Sadie's surgery. Speaking of which Sadie's scar was a cute little line on her face instead of the disfiguring gash that left her with almost no will to live. 

Bill Turcotte, at first I thought he was a clever way to prevent viewers from having to hear endless monologues from Jake since he spends the bulk of the book alone. During the happy birthday Lee episode I feel like he just goes off the rails way too fast for his character. 

Anyway I genuinely enjoyed both but there were some differences that really irked me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best extended stay locations for visitors staying for a month? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-17 18:43:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My parents are interested in spending the month of december out here and I'm trying to find the best place for them to stay. I've heard of people renting condos and I'm wondering what would be cheaper between that and an extended stay type hotel. They're both retired on fixed incomes so I'm looking for the cheapest route without setting them up in a terrible neighborhood. 

Any advice helps, thanks! </TEXT>
