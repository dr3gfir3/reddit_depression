1. She doesn't get any benefits to begin with.

2. The Postal Service in in decline because of a law passed in 2006 that started making them pre-pay benefits for FUTURE employees. The Postal Service has given the government so much money that as of right now they're paying future benefits for Employees that haven't even been born yet. 

3. When a business needs to "trim the fat" They should start with corporate waste!

	<TITLE> What is your worst Valentines Day experience? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-02-14 02:23:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was in high school, this girl move up to PA from Georgia.  She had this sweet sweet southern accent and the prettiest eyes you've ever seen.

We went to school together but she was a year behind me so I never really had the chance to talk to her... Well my senior year I was like "Fuck it. It's now or never."  So valentines day rolls around and she's kinda down because she doesn't have a valentine. It's my time to shine, I thought...
So I had some flowers delivered to the school for her with a card asking her to hang out is she was free after school. Well, she thought they were from the guy she liked. Now, I'm not the best looking guy, but what happened next blew my mind...

My sister meets me at my car after school and says "Dude... Did you send ____ flowers?"  I of course smiled and said "Yeah, what did she say!?"  To which my sister replied...

"Well... She's running around school telling everyone you're stalking her. She is having a couple guys walk her to her bus so you don't try anything."

Pretty much destroyed Valentines Day forever.



**TL;DR** I sent a girl flowers and she told everyone I was stalking her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. I really wish more people would comment, especially if they don't like it. I'm curious to know why.  You should check out my Boondock Saints tat if you haven't already.  That's a pretty sick Coheed and Cambria  tattoo you've got. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The artist is my cousin. He didn't really want to do steampunk because he isn't familiar with the concept.  But I was like "Nah, you got this!"  

It's not leather, it's supposed to be a reddish bronze, but it came out a little dark. I'm hoping it'll lighten up once it peels. I just got it done Saturday.  I'm glad I finally got some feedback rather than just downvotes. Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay. Why don't you go find him and politely ask him to come to the station with you? Let us know what happens. 

Obviously he's not slaughtering people, but who knows how many people recognized him and are dead now but the bodies are hidden. Maybe none, maybe 20. It's impossible to know. But we do know that he is suspected of murder, he HAS opened fire on people, and he doesn't want to go easily. Is that enough of a reason? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This guy is on the run and extremely dangerous.  The Aurora shooter was waiting for the police and didn't put up a fight. If you tried to subdue him, he would have gone down. If someone tries to take down dorner, they better shoot first. Not necessarily a fatal shot, but you don't want to give him the chance to get the jump on you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why don't you tell me about this "technology" that causes automatics to get better gas mileage?  It may not be immediately significant but manuals DO get slightly better gas mileage.  Have do ever noticed how "experts" assure you that automatics are just as good yet they fail multiple times more often than manuals?  How about the fact that if you're buying a new car it costs you $1000+ to have the auto installed instead?  Also, you CAN downshift an automatic... That is, if you want to destroy it faster. Any questions? </TEXT>

**EDIT:** I just realized that this could be taken as sarcasm and/or an insult.  I like the Penguins, I think Vokoun is an awesome addition to the team and way better than fleury.  And I fucking love Tim Bits. (Just to show that I'm serious) </TEXT>
