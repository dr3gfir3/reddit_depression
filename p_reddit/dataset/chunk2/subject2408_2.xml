	<TEXT> I really like it tbh, I enjoy so-bad-its-good stuff like The Room or Birdemic in small doses and a 20 minute OVA is the perfect length. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't remember much about the movie but I don't remember thinking that it was overdone, and I'm usually not a big fan of digital effects. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think 5 cm should be on this list instead of Your Name, it's a better film and a small blurb should be enough to prepare viewers for what to expect from it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't seen the rest but Tanaka-kun is a pretty enjoyable slice of life, not everything needs to be a classic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason we associate short blue hair or flamey red hair with those two character archetypes is because of EVA I think, not necessarily the other way around.
Nope, it's basic colour theory. Red: fiery, Blue: cool (The different hues also play a part in it) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Mikasa does have romantic feelings for Eren but even it's just familial love, it still makes sense, Eren risked his life to save her and was the first person to show her affection after the death of he family and he never treats her differently than he would any other friend/family member. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So they traced over CG? Because the wonkiness of the shapes doesn't look like it's CG. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's two more big mysteries and the last five episodes are all episodic. The overarching plot is about Oreki coming out of his shell, and the final episode pays of pretty well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that it's Mimi at the top. The colours aren't really true to the show, Papika's hair is peach rather orange/red. Plus, aside from being a reference to Hansel and Gretel I feel it sort of reflects what happens in the show, [Flip Flappers spoilers](/s "she keeps Papika trapped and sort of holds Cocona hostage") </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't seen Penny Dreadful but saying a show should only focus on a good actor if they cast a good actor is a dumb reason for saying a show is bad. </TEXT>
