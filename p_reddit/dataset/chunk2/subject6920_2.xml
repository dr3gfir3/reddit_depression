	<TEXT> 1. Mainstream media collusion with HRC, proven by wikileaks with multiple MSM journalists allowing HRC campaign to selectively edit articles about them. That's not journalism, it's propaganda. 
2. DNC collusion to make HRC victor in democratic primaries. The DNC chair even had to resign... And was promptly hired by HRC campaign. And her replacement is now under fire for feeding debate questions to HRC from CNN, tying back to #1.

So there's two right off the bat without even thinking. I'd love to hear defenses for these. 

Edit: forgot another one! 
3. HRC campaign paying instigators at trump rallies to start fights.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Am I the only one sick of this aspect of presidential campaigning politics? You shred each other to hell in primaries (and that's on both sides of the aisle) then pretend like you totally support the person that wins the nom. So glad God Emperor has called out how ridiculous it is, quoting Michelle Obamas comments on Hillary and Bernie comments on Hillary. Just shows that they're either lying during the primaries, or lying during their support of the nomination winner (they are). Bernie is such a ridiculous cuck giving his support to the bullies that basically stole his lunch money and rigged the election out of his hands. If he had any dignity he would take a stand instead of pretending to support the Clinton cartel.  </TEXT>
