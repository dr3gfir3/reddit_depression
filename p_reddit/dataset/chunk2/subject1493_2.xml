	<TEXT> Ya vaping will turn it brown, as long as it isnt brown prior youre good ahaha. Its actually still smokeable after vaping, although less potent, you can make edibles with enough of it too. I think [this](http://www.theweedblog.com/the-difference-between-indica-and-sativa-marijuana-plants/) explains the differences between sativa and indica quite nicely. It also explains the medical benefits of both, its a good read. Anyway if you have any more questions feel free to pm me, ill answer what i can.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its no trouble at all, theres a lot more to it then first glance, and i know having someone experienced get me started helped a lot. About your bud, what does it smell like? Is it skunky? Or does it have a sweeter fruity kind of smell? Does it have no distinct smell at all? How strong would you say it smells? Is it dry to the touch? Does it grind up powdery or more in a clump? Do your fingers get a lot of chrystal like dust on them if you touch it? Or is it really sticky and dense? What color is it? Dark green, bright green, brown (hopefully not)? Can you see little red hairs on it? 

Sorry for all the questions but i can probably guess roughly what strain and quality it is from that info. I could be wrong but there are some things that heavily hint towards how good your weed is, and also these are questions you want to ask yourself when you buy pot. I can explain more with whatever answers you give me, if you want of course. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again dont know much about vape brands and such but if you paid ~$100 or more its probably decent. You may want to adjust the temp manually if you can,  but im not quite sure what the ideal temp is (ive heard ~320f but im not % 100,  /r/trees probably knows aha). 

How many times have you smoked? Most people dont feel very much their first couple of times, some dont feel anything, so thats a factor. Quality of your weed also matters, you said it was ditch weed, which doesnt necessarily mean low thc/high cbd, it  could just have low of both. There are three major strains in the cannabis family, *cannabis indica* (lower thc, higher cbd, ie "body high"), *cannabis sativa* (higher thc, lower cbd, ie "head high"), and *cannabis ruderalis* which is hemp and has very low of both and really isnt sold. Now each strain is hard  to distinguish on sight and almost doesnt matter if it isnt properly grown dried and cured, but in general quality bud will be 1.) Smelly, it means its cured properly 2.) Not wet, it should be dry or dense and sticky but not damp and  3.) It will have lots kief or chrystal on it, its the powdery stuff  you get from grinding it. Theres more but thats the big 3 i can think of right now. If you are an MMJ patient i suggest asking for indica strains, if your not then selection isnt always an option unless youve got a good dealer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You want to get it deep into your lungs, think about taking a big breath before jumping into a pool. You want to get as much air in as you can. Do the same with a vape except nice and slow, hold it for a couple seconds, then let out gently. It may take a little to get right. Also the quality of your vape matters, like a lot usually, a cheap one will not be effective, and if its handheld, it barely works in my experience. Vapes are more complicated then a bong or pipe, which use the basic principles of pressure to operate. Vapes need to be precise in their temperature, too hot and the pot burns and makes smoke, too little and the concentration wont be enough to work. If you want info on what kind to buy, im not much help, since im primarily a bong guy. If you make a thread on /r/trees explaining your situation im sure they would be more than happy to point you in the right direction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I meant feminists as in, first world tumblr style feminists, that's the reason i specified them. They have nothing to fight for, because they refuse to acknowledge the things you've outlined. Personally I'm for egalitarianism, I don't deny that inequalities exist but it's no longer a fight for women to simply be recognized as equal legally, they won that (again in the 1st world), it's more nuanced now as you say. 

why are women still considered to be the "primary" caregivers?

[Tender Years Doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tender_years_doctrine), feminists wanted to be considered primary caregivers. (It made sense at the time, Women had very little rights, and even though it has been abolished, it's the main reason women get preferential custody in the US)

I'm sorry that you seem to believe no one is actually out there fighting for people who aren't of their own gender

Where do you get that from? I never denied that people are fighting for equality, I just denied that tumblr feminists have anything to fight for, If they want to address the issues you outlined they would have to acknowledge the inequality men face. Which they won't. Please read my comment before replying, right after the quote you use at the top I specify I mean tumblr feminists, for the very reason that I know people out there are actually fighting for things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that overall men have it better, but that's why I specified *1st world tumblr-style* feminists and not feminists as a whole. I'm not stupid enough to try to claim women are equal everywhere, that's just plain not true, as Saudi Arabia and the like kindly demonstrate on a regular basis. There are definitely still things that need to be changed in this world. I also agree that passive aggressive taunts at feminism does jack shit, but does that mean that men should be met with violence every time they want to talk about things? I personally think feminism and MRA's are misguided, I side with egalitarianism and humanism. However, i don't think either of these groups should be prevented from discussing what they want simply because I either disagree or because it gets nothing done. Just because MRA's are mostly talk does not mean they should be met with hostility, although it's a completely valid criticism of the movement. 

Frankly, I agree with everything you just said, neither tumblr feminism nor MRA's are changing anything. And those are absolutely valid critiques of both movements. However, neither deserves to be outright prevented from discussing their opinions and thoughts simply because it doesn't change the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a lot places 16 year olds can consent (Canada, Scandinavia, etc) and even if they can't most places have legislature that outlines the acceptable difference in age. I.E I think here (Canada) it's 3 years(?) so that if a couple are 15 and 17, and one of them turns 18, or if a 14 and a 15 year old do it, it's not automatically statutory rape. There is a lower cut off point though i think, where they cannot consent no matter what. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are people so afraid of having men talk about their own issues? Personally, I think it points to a bigger problem; feminists have nothing to fight for. Or at least 1st world tumblr-style feminists don't. They can vote, they can drive, they can fuck who they want, go where they please, they have tons of scholarships dedicated solely to women (while all others are unisex i believe), and businesses are actively encouraged to hire women. All the fighting has already been done by the much stronger and more equality driven feminists of old. 


So what do modern feminists have left? Nothing really, they've won for the most part, and they're now trying to push for female supremacy. Evidence of which is their outright hostility towards men even thinking to address their half of the populations problems. How do you make sure your ideology goes unchallenged? Silence any and all dissent, something that would be (rightfully) denounced as oppression in a heartbeat if it were to happen to them. To me it seems like they really want to be the oppressors, while at the same time being the victims. Which are obviously two very contradictory positions. (sorry that got a little long.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So based on your article the solution would be to standardize an amount for each portion size, not ban 16 ounce drinks outright. The problem it outlined is that different establishments have different definitions of "large" and "regular" and people react differently to different labels. So having 16 ounces as regular means people drink more than if it was labelled "extra large". The actual amount didn't really matter it's just how it was presented that changed peoples behavior towards it. 

I think one should have the choice to get a 16 ounce drink if they want to but restaurants have to label them large or extra large and not have them as the regular size. I'm not one of those people who would get a 16 oz, I drink very little soda but it just seems kind of ridiculous to try to prevent adults from having certain amounts of a soft drink. Especially when they can go buy enough booze and cigarettes to kill themselves if they so desire. Just seems excessive and misguided to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Things outside of the realm of science generally fall into this, not to say science is infallible, just that science acknowledges it's fallibility and actively works to correct it. Scientific facts aren't ones that can be argued from emotion, or really from lenses other than the scientific method. SJW's hate this because they've been taught how to think through the lens of feminist and post-modernist critique. These lenses have their uses but they can't be applied to scientific fact because science doesn't give a damn whether it considers women or not. The natural world is unfair, it's harsh, things are rarely equal, and it's not because white men say it is but because humans have observed these phenomena and written them down. Trying to argue that fat has no negative health consequences because it makes you *feel bad* is ridiculous, it's like trying to argue the speed of light is privileged because it is faster than other waveforms and therefore oppressing them (yes someone argued this). All these people need is evidence and a good argument to disprove these basic biological concepts but they won't find any because they'd rather complain about how it makes them sad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hell if I knew them I would get them the best strain I could find. Sourcing may be the problem though actually, finding someone who is very likely outside their social circle to sell them illegal substances in a trustworthy manner is not a small task. It's very possible that they don't have stoners in their social circles, and finding someone who can provide a product that not only is the right strain but safe and reliable is not exactly simple. Ya there's lots of dealers out there but a lot of them aren't upstanding citizens, and would just as happily rip you off, or maybe rob you if their really nuts. So I can understand being very hesitant with not only buying but giving unregulated things you got off the street to your children. Again, we understand pot is never really messed with (it's not cost effective to lace it with more expensive drugs) plus a lot of dealers are genuinely great people but they don't know that, and if they don't have someone to show them the ropes, they're going to be extremely cautious.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to remember these people don't have a list of contacts like you and I do. They don't know any drug dealers because they haven't had to up until now. I agree that if I were in their shoes I would hit up my guy and get some ASAP but that's the thing, I have a guy already, and if not I have stoner friends who will find me one. They don't have that connection, they're parents with a sick child and don't know where to go or what to do. They're not stoners, they don't know what they're doing and they're terrified. It may be easy for you and me to score but it's not the same way for everyone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well in WW1 Britain declared war for us in 1914 (we didn't have control over foreign affairs at the time), then America joined in 1917. In WW2 Canada declared war on Germany a few days after Britain in 1939, America joined in 1942. We we're both in the Korean war so there's that. We weren't in Vietnam, or Iraq 1, but we were part of the coalition for Iraq 2. Canada tends to do peacekeeping missions instead of invasions or wars (we have a standing army of like 60,000, what do you expect?) So in reality we haven't really gone to war in tandem, like ever, it would be more accurate to say Canada has rode shotgun with Britain in every single war. That being said, you Americans do your own thing, always have, and we'll gladly share a beer with ya whenever buddy.  </TEXT>

My entire comment was about how spanking *on it's own* doesn't necessarily teach a good lesson but in conjunction with talking about it and making sure the kid understands it can teach a good lesson. That's what i mean by *in a way* he's right, not that his statement at face value is factual but that a larger point can be made. Just because I saw a bit of truth in a dog turd argument doesn't mean I support the whole dog turd argument. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a way he's right, a spanking without follow up can end up teaching the child nothing, especially if the spanking doesn't happen right after whatever incident incited it. If you just randomly pull the kid aside and spank them, there's little guarantee they will figure out what they did wrong (depending on the age and the intelligence of the child). That being said reserving a decent spanking for the serious stuff and a good talk afterwards about why it happened and what they did wrong is pretty effective, at least in my experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, we shouldn't associate all mental illness with evil, or all mental illness with good, it's as varied as the people it effects. It can be hard to separate the illness from the person though, because in a way mental illness is part of who we are. It doesn't necessarily define us but it does have an effect on how we act, the choices we make, and the thoughts we think (in highly varying ways from person to person). It's a tough character trait to pull off correctly without some experience in it and it can be easy for someone unfamiliar to paint it in strokes of black and white. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a person who lives with mental illness i think it's a good thing to expose people to mental illness, good or bad. I feel it humanizes it, and brings the reality of both the good and evil parts of it into the light instead of ignoring that aspect of humanity entirely. When we push things into the realm of no discussion, we dehumanize it, we put it outside our reality, which makes it hard to understand. 

Not that every show/movie/book/game needs a mentally ill character or even that all mentally ill characters are necessary. However, I take no offense to an evil character who suffers from depression, it makes the villain human to me, and not just a character who's sole purpose is being evil. I just think characters without flaws are boring, and don't really represent how humans actually think or act. </TEXT>

My problem with the picture is how do we know it's Dave Grohl's? The actual act of cutting oneself while playing is not uncommon but without proof this is just a guitar with blood on it. Which can be inspiring in and of itself but OP is making a pretty hefty claim here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the systematic subjugation of a group of people by another group of people who have access to social power, the result of which benefits one group over the other, and is maintained by social beliefs and practices.

They've never explained how thin people in anyway fit this description. They just say that we're oppressing them and provide this definition as if it proves some innate fact. Seriously though, has anyone even attempted to explain how thin people are not only one homogenous group of unified belief but also how they have access to social power by virtue of having less mass. I mean it, I want to know, in detail, how exactly are they being systematically oppressed and how exactly do they know it's by thin people specifically. Things like paying more for more material, paying more for taking up more space, being called fat, not being happy about yourself, and not having special accommodations made for you are not systemic oppression but consequences of your weight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>    When i was younger I was really unashamed, and not self conscious at all. I would say anything, do anything, and wasn't really scared of what people thought of me. Unfortunately, I contracted Chronic Fatigue Syndrome at around 11 years old. This caused me to miss lots of school and I managed to gain a lot of weight as well. Due to me not being there I missed lots of what I think were key social milestones. Now about 6 years later I'm pretty socially withdrawn, i've developed some rather annoying anxieties, and my self-confidence is shot to hell. I managed to lose all the weight I had amassed and i'm even pretty jacked at this point but I still can't seem to get a grasp on my head. I'm in largely the same boat as you, I hate the way my brain makes assumptions, I hate not being able to confidently look at girls even though I know I'm not unattractive, I hate not being able to make sense of any of this. I'm seeking therapeutic help, and am slowly learning how to accept my flaws and be happy with the cards i've been dealt. It's hard though, and I think most people will tell you the same, changing things that seem almost hard coded into your personality is not a task to be undertaken lightly. 


  So I guess my point is that what you're experiencing is not wholly unique to you. There are others who have felt and overcame what we both go through, probably not in the exact same contexts, but overcome nonetheless. It's just always easier said than done. However, you deserve a better life, one unburdened by anxieties, and that life is in your hands to create. It will require action on your part, you are going to have to overthrow this and if you don't know how, therapy is probably your best bet. Just remember you are always worth it, you and your life are worth all the effort in the world. It may not seem like it at times but you as a person is the most valuable thing you will ever have.  </TEXT>

Unless he has some epiphany, or you somehow manage to get through to him, he's just going to continue to be the adult he turned in to. I don't blame your mom for thinking of him as her baby (all moms are varying levels of crazy), but he's an adult, what he does is of his own volition and is his responsibility.

Edit: Ok, i didnt think this through before posting. People can change, it was stupid of me to assume he wouldnt.  </TEXT>
