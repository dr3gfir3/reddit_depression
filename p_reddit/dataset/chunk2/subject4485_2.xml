i don't expect it to give better performance than the 1080 Ti or Titan.. but if its a 1070 or 1080 for a decent price, i see it being sold in high numbers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i just wanna be sure here...

because spending money on a new monitor, when it might be related to other hardware, could be silly. 

so i assume you have tested the monitor on another PC, dvd player or whatever, to see if the problem is there as well?

I had a very similar problem on an old laptop and it was fixed with a new motherboard (iirc, its been some years ago.. it certainly wasnt the screen itself) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do that, and it's awesome.

My work schedule is usually meet either between 5 or 7 or between 11 and 13.

and so i get to bed at around 22:00 and get up between 4 or 6 every day. So when i dont start work before 11, i still have 5 hours before work, where i can chill, shower, eat, cook an awesome lunch and do a few chores or whatever i need to do, before work. 

Usually though, i just play computer games and browse reddit.

When all cores are done before work, all my spare time after work is... spare time. i dont have any obligrations except a few social stuff whenever it's been arranged. it's nice. :) </TEXT>
