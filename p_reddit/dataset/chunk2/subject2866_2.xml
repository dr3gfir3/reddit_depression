	<TEXT> Thank you for the kind words.

I'm not sure if your girlfriend is in therapy, but if she is not, I highly recommend it. I was very fortunate when I was first went into the doctors due to self harming, that my doctor put me in a trial being conducted at my local university (by Dr. Marsha Linehan) which gave me two years of free therapy, as they studied my BPD. I do dialectic behavioral therapy, and also did EMDR to help me with my past abuse as well.

	<TEXT> How do I take on a day with my diagnoses? Pretty much one day and one event at a time. My husband gave me the "five year rule", in which I only can worry about things up to five years in advance. This really helped when my kids were younger (toddler age) and I was freaking out about them getting into car accidents when they got their license.

I definitely have triggers, so I try to avoid them, such as arguing with family, and stupid people. :) . I also still go to therapy, which helps me decompress my feelings. There are definitely bad days, which I can spot coming if I'm feeling overwhelmed. I live by lists, I have a to-do daily list which helps me keep track of things, and trigger exposures. </TEXT>
