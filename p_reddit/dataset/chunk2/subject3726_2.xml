	<TITLE> Slow/potroasting blues </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-12 20:32:15 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Good people of AskCulinary. I have a question about slow roasting/ slow potroasting. 

When I have a joint of meat that requires a long and slow roast (the joint that prompted this question was a shoulder of venison) recipes I look up as a guide usually tell me to set the oven at around 160c (320f). Cooking times can vary from 2 to usually around 4 hours. On checking the roast after about 90 minutes, however, I often find any liquid that I've added to the pot bubbling pretty confidently. Now if I was attempting to slow cook something on the hob this kind of bubbling boil would prompt me to turn the heat *right* down immediately. For meat that needs very gentle treatment my instinct wants me to find a heat that has any stock barely moving - maybe sending up a bubble every now and then to let you know there's something happening. This, it seems to me, would require an oven temperature more like 125c (255f). But the recipes always give 160. I should add I'm quite often a little disatisfied with the joint in question, and can't help thinking - this would have been much nicer in a much lower oven for much longer. Should I just defy the recipes and go with my instinct on this? Any advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wowzer - that's quite a find! I would say go chronologically and be prepared for some highs and lows. Just IMO of course, not all of Bergman has aged all that well. I have been disappointed by some of the iconic 'masterpieces', and pleasantly surprised by some of the 'lesser' films. The great stuff is still great though. *Wild Strawberries* is, for me, one of cinema's most precious treasures. When you've got through them all finish the Bergman-a-thon with *Fanny And Alexander*. It sums everything up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can see that it's a seduction scene. Probably Mamet chose to frame the Lingk/Roma storyline that way to emphasise the irresistable charisma and the manipulative power of the Roma character - like he probably *could* seduce the guy into bed. He could persuade anyone to do anything! But the term 'latent homosexuality' is too strong. It's taking a metaphor and making it something literal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Naomi Watts isn't on my list of greatest actors, but she's wonderful in *MD*! Now I'm no fool and I watch a *lot* of movies - but when that movie switches realities about two thirds of the way through, I *did not realise* that was still Naomi Watts. I thought that was a totally different actress. I'm kind of embarrassed about that now, but hopefully I was just completely absorbed in the movie (which I totally *was*) and my brain bought the reality switch hook line and sinker!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to post twice on this - I find it really interesting and I thought of something else I'd like to add. I'm thinking about the films of David Lynch. It seems to me he seeks out and encourages OTT performances from actors that are always teetering on the brink of camp. I'm thinking Laura Dern in *Blue Velvet* and *Wild At Heart*, Naomi Watts in *Mullholland Drive*, and also Sheryl Lee in *Fire Walk With Me*. You could add many other Lynch performances to this list. Lynch is known as a maverick auteur of course, but perhaps his direction of actors is underrated because those performances are often of the style OP describes. There is a beauty in these performances I think is sometimes overlooked. Cheryl Lee in *Fire Walk* - what an extraordinary job she does there. An absolute emotional roller coaster of a role that requires her to dedicate herself completely. There is always the danger with these examples that the actor will end up looking completely ridiculous - just think of the action Lynch demands of them! But they appear fearless, and they do a sensational job. Do they deserve more credit for their work with Lynch? From memory I can't think of Lynch movies that have won a ton of rewards for acting (please correct me). Maybe the style is just too wierd for mainstream acclaim.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is perhaps not quite the same thing (because the example I'm about to give is so *knowingly* camp), but I've always considered Tim Curry's performance in *The Rocky Horror Picture Show* oscar-worthy. His dedication to that role is so impressive - and it takes talent to achieve that level of sheer abandon. Another campy comic turn I hugely admire is Joan Cusack in *Adams Family Values*.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The mechanism of cinema is, at its core, populist. The primary function of cinema is to make money by entertaining the masses. What we think of as 'art cinema' is an offshoot of popular cinema. Although the cross-overs between the two schools are many and the grey areas so vast as to make the distinctions near irrelevant, it could still be argued that very generally art cinema's principle goals are not to make money by entertaining the masses. Film critics and lists of 'greatest films' tend to focus either on art cinema, or on populist films from long enough ago to have earned them the status of 'classics'. I fall into this trap myself. I love *Die Hard*, but I've never considered putting it on my greatest films list next to *Wild Strawberries*. But does *Die Hard* really contain less artistry than *Wild Strawberries*? This is a constant and fascinating fault line that exists in cinema more than in any other art form - possibly because cinema is one of the worlds most lucrative creative industries.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My reply to this question is boring, but I think the truth of the matter is there are as many types of artists as there are people. Probably there is no universal quality that makes for a great artist. Arguably the 20th Century's greatest playwright and towering example of creative integrity Arthur Miller had a son with down syndrome he kept secret from the world and rarely visited. Honesty, at least in a kind of 'blanket' sense, is not prerequisite to high achievement in the arts. Talent is all.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Planning a rabbit confit - need advice </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi wonderfully helpful people of AskCulinary. 
I'm on a preserving kick at the moment and am planning to move from fruits into meat, starting with a confit rabbit. Recipes for this are not many (quite a lot on youtube, but not much detail) and those there are vary wildly in terms of salting times/ cooking times/ storing period. My main question is this: Can I confit and bottle rabbit pieces as I would fruit? That is, once safely sealed in a kilner jar, can my rabbit confit be stored in the pantry, or is it always for the fridge? Anyone have experience with this? I expect to mess it up a few times before I get it right.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ha! I know what you mean. I've been going to yoga classes for eight years, so I have practiced this quite a lot! I think that if you are extremely infexible in one specific way, sometimes people just *don't get it* because their hips and hamstrings (in my case) basically come from a different planet than yours. It's like they can't even *think* themselves into the body of someone who literally can't sit upright when in wide leg pose. Just today in fact I watched a video on youtube about how to do seated forward folds for 'very stiff people'. Well the 'very stiff person' was sitting upright quite happily and doing all that stuff like 'lifting the buttock flesh back with the hands' and 'turning the thigh flesh outwards'. If I do anything with my hands other than support my weight at the back I fall over! People often say 'really root your sit bones to the ground'. Mine are never rooted to the ground because my pelvis is tilted back and I'm using my abs to keep me upright - fighting gravity rather than using it! To be honest I've always suspected it's to do with the shape and/or angle of my pelvis. I'm quite wide hipped and have long thin legs and quite a small rib cage - there's something about my build that doesn't even *look* like it should be flexible! Standing forward folds are no problem - I enjoy them, but of course you've got a whole lot of gravity helping you out there. My challenge is as much to deal with the 'dread' I have of this pose more than anything else. I don't need to be flexible to enjoy my yoga - but I dislike the worry that maybe this next class is going to focus on seated straight-leg poses, and the horrible sinking feeling when I find out it is! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. I will be mindful of what my tailbone is doing next time I'm trying this pose. It is such a challenge for me - I always need to put my hands on the ground behind me after just a short time. I find I can end up spending long (or they *feel* long) periods simply sitting up in this position while the rest of the class are involved in various progressions. I must admit I get self conscious on this situation - where elsewhere I'm very happy to work at my own level despite what my neighbour might be doing. I guess this is such an obvious one - one guy simply struggling to sit upright for so long! </TEXT>

 It should feel like you're about to slide off of it

So is my bottom sitting right on the edge of the blankets? Will this not encourage my tailbone to angle toward my feet? Elsewhere I am reading that I should try to angle my tailbone the other way. 

 Try not to focus on getting your forehead to the floor

Oh my goodness there are no worries there! I'm trying to focus on sitting up!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmmm - maybe I shouldn't have used the word 'male'. But I saw a clip of a Connery Bond on TV not long ago - think it might have been *Goldfinger* - poolside - Bond is getting a massage from pretty lady - someone arrives to talk to him and he slaps the girl on the ass and says 'run along now, the men have to talk'. The girl enjoys it and turns to give him a flirtatious smile. It's all just incredibly embarrassing and kind of sickening tbh. And I don't think this is a female fantasy! And these days? No - men are not allowed to have those fantasies. Well, they can *have* them of course! But they shouldn't ask us to celebrate them in a public forum. *Yes of course* these things don't happen in contemporary Bond films - but *this is the baggage they're constantly trying to offload*. It's just wearisome.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> wide angle seated poses - how can I overcome the dread?? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-17 13:03:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi - my first question here so apologies if it's been asked a billion times which it no doubt has. I've been practicing yoga for about 8 years or so - classes at my local centre 2/3 times a week. I love it! 

I have a tough time though, both mentally and physically, with wide angle seated poses (well - all straight-leg seated poses, but especially wide angled ones). My body just does not sit that way - it feels like something my pelvis/hips just does not want me to do. It's never painful, but tbh I have a real struggle even to sit up with wide angle legs. I'm the guy at the back of the class with his chin tucked down into his chest and his arms stretched out like he's trying to grab onto the end of a rope, while people around me flop over and rest their foreheads on the floor!

Of course there are loads of other yoga poses I struggle with (I'm not a naturally flexible guy), but I'm happy to work away at my own level with these and have learned 'steps towards' the poses that feel right for *me*. Yoga has a mental/emotional level for me which is to do with self kindness and finding your own level of challenge - this is why I love yoga! But this wide-angle seated pose - it fills me with dread! Some classes focus on it - and I *hate* those. My heart sinks!

How can I find a way to challenge myself with kindness in this pose? The problem is there seem to be few 'steps towards' this pose for someone who is unable even to sit upright with his legs wide. I have asked teachers about it but usually they advise working on simply stretching to make myself more flexible - something I have done, but I don't think they appreciate just how hard this pose is for me. Any help appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really think horror films *are* dismissed by 'serious' film fans or critics. The genre continues to be enjoyed by millions and is as alive and well as ever (as far as I can see - I'm not a horror fan so I'm looking at this from the outside). 

I think the distinction you make between horror and what we loosely think of as 'arthouse' (whatever that is) can be made between arthouse and other film genres - for example action movies or romcom. Action, horror, romcom - while there are of course cross-over examples (*The Shining* springs to mind) the majority of films that identify with these labels have a primary goal which is, whatever else they might do, to thrill and to entertain. To thrill and entertain was not the primary goal of Bergman's most iconic work. It's simply a question of identities, and I think even the most refined cineaste would admit there are great examples from most schools of film making. I, for example, am pretty much a hardcore arthouse fanatic, but every time I watch *Die Hard* I have to admit the film is a stone cold masterpiece. All I'm saying is that Horror is a populist form - it's in its DNA. 

I think there *are* some 'serious', well respected film artists who have explored similar territory to Horror, but because of their creative background we don't immediately see their work that way. Lars Von Trier, for example, in something like *Antichrist* is, to me, making a 'horror' movie of sorts. But we don't think of it that way because the film is simply not selling itself so - neither in its marketing nor really in its creative objectives. But the territory it explores could easily be that of a 'horror' movie. I would say the same of some of Haneke. And of course Tarantino.  

I should point out that, as with all creative activity, there are big grey areas in my argument. It's this that makes the question interesting to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They should give it up - it's about 40 years past its 'use by' date. James Bond is a male fantasy that is completely innapropriate for our times. The only way producers can see round this is to have the character die inside and to start deconstructing the mythology from *within* said mythology. Clever - but the problem they are left with is that Bond inevitably stops enjoying his life, and when Bond stops enjoying his life so does the audience. Can we just move on? </TEXT>
