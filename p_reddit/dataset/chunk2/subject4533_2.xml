Have a good listen. Sound like something familiar? 

If you didn't notice, it is this: https://soundcloud.com/flume/lorde-tennis-court-flume-remix

Uploading someone else's remix that you had no participation in is the biggest dog move you can pull from a producers point of view. I was expecting some variation at least when i first pressed play but NOPE. The whole track is exactly the same and is flooded with tags making it look like its his. 

Just wanted to shine a light on this topic because this happens a lot. Bit of a no-brainer, though. The actual remix nearly has three million hits in less than two weeks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The songs he produces sounds like they were made by a thirteen year old. Maybe he thinks that putting "Festival Trap" in all of his remix titles makes it seem like he has discovered something unreal and original. Makes me angry how he boasts about how much effort he spends in the studio and that he deserves this fame when really his remix of Spaceman by Hardwell has just been high-passed and sidechained like a mother f with a trap beat over the top. 

Oh well. I guess thats what people want these days. But seriously, there is SO MUCH hidden talent lying around if you spend a good few hours searching for new and innovative music.

	<TEXT> Looking at HARD Summer, Ultra, all the festivals that attract large crowds, the lineups dont get me excited anymore. Its just the same djs, the same live acts all squashed into one big mess. Of course when youre there you are having a great time, but I am looking at this from a different perspective. What will the lineups be like in a couple of years? Will they be the exact same? Surely maybe at least a few acts will rise to fame and they will be added but thats just a minor adjustment. And what about crowd numbers? If attendants look at the lineup and go 'hey wait a minute i saw these people last year', numbers would start decreasing. 

Just something I wanted to discuss with you guys :)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have similiar music tastes. Some great artists to branch off of: 

https://soundcloud.com/manlikezha - Grime, garage, uk funky.

https://soundcloud.com/killjoybadboy - grime, uk funky, house. killer beats!

https://soundcloud.com/diversa - chilled, nice flowing beats.


https://soundcloud.com/asamusicofficial - ambient, garage, some grime.

https://soundcloud.com/ikickedacloudonce - crazy beats. very diverse.


Some labels to keep an eye on: 

https://soundcloud.com/fentplates - nice chilled beats mostly.

https://soundcloud.com/pilerats - best australian prods. 

https://soundcloud.com/gradient-audio - very diverse range of genres - dubstep, ambient, chill.

https://soundcloud.com/tumbleaudio - brilliant club music. grime, uk funky, house. keep a good eye on this.

Tl;DR: Make a soundcloud account. Start off with one artist, end up with hundreds. So much fun finding new+different artists.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To me Diplo is just another one of 'those' producers. I loved the first album he put out as Major Lazer because it was just so different to what I usually listen to. Now he's just another trap producer looking for the next banger. Everyones like: "mannn diplos set was fucking banging!!!". Its just jamaican shit with him screaming GET UP every two minutes.

Edit: also, revolution was like knifes in my ears.

1. Wake up. Put a pair of socks on. 
2. Commit to wearing this particular pair of socks all day. ALL DAY. I don't care what happens during your day, just keep them damn socks on. 
3. You will feel the urge to take them off. RESIST. It is worth it I promise. 
4. When it comes to bed time, get in a comfy position. Now, when you are just about to doze off, take your socks off using your feet. 
5. Experience the fucking brilliant sensation of your feet that have just been exposed to the soft material of the sheets in your bed. I cannot tell you how satisfying this feels in words. 
TIP: for more satisfaction, have fresh sheets. 

TL;DR: Wear socks all day, take off when in bed. Have the best sleep of your life.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My experience at Future Music Festival. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-04 05:11:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before you read this I would like to place emphasis on the fact that this is a matter of opinion and taste. 

Future Music Festival this year donned the likes of Adventure Club, Sub Focus, Baauer, Knife Party, Netsky and many many more. I was keen to see all of these acts. 

The day began with Adventure Club in the boiler room. I See Monstas had just finished playing and the crowd was waiting for AC and their classic dubstep sound they were known for. They opened with some big festival banger, which wasn't surprising as they probably wanted to get the crowd going. This is where the reason why I am writing this post comes in. Their whole set was literally festival bangers the whole way through. Now, I don't want this post just to be a biased rant about artists playing songs to please the crowd, but what happened to artists playing their own tracks for a large majority of their set? Isn't that the reason why we go see them play? Even Sub Focus, who played live, dropped one song that was identical to Martin Garrix's Animals. 

And these types of songs were played throughout the whole day. Im not too sure about other attendees but this gave me a huge headache. The night was topped off with Knife Party's awful, awful set that sounded like nearly every other set i heard that day. Thank god we left early to see Gesaffelstein play, which was the highlight of my day. He played an intense show. 

Overall, including the hefty $175 ticket, it was an average day. This really came down to what I have said above. It was a huge let down witnessing great acts follow the trend just to please the crowd. 

Maybe im going to the wrong festivals.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Remixing songs without having stems. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-23 16:02:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I want to write this post to hopefully inspire some and also to give an insight into how a complete track can be remixed without the remixer having the single stem files. 

I think the most important priority in this case is song selection. If you are remixing a song that has A LOT going on in it, then it is going to be a bit tricky to single out elements you want to use. Which is why I choose songs that have distinct elements that I can sample and use. I use Abletons Sampler to find bits and pieces through out the song. 

I had a go at remixing Culprates "My Rock": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB3PnlMUbTA

As you can hear, there are some very useable bits and pieces throughout the track.

Heres my remix: https://soundcloud.com/abcdegrapes/culprate-my-rock-grapes-cheeky

Some of my productions are solely sample-based and that clearly shows in the remix I did. 

Another interesting way to remix a song without having stems is to use Abletons "convert to MIDI" feature. When done right, this can producer amazing results. Giving you the MIDI information of say, a melody or even a drum pattern within a track. This can be tricky to get right but it is worth having a shot. 

I know this post comes across as simplistic but hopefully I provoked some thought into how you remix a riddim. 

I would also like to hear how you guys remix tracks without stems!  </TEXT>
