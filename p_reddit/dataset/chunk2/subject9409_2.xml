	<TEXT> Wrote a case study of two Toronto agencies on their social media strategies, and how to compromise between being trendy, taking risks, and playing it safe. Have you guys read Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath? The idea of testable credentials is from there, and I think it's more applicable than ever now that agencies have their own social accounts.

"Please RT! I #followback" - Don Draper, never

Is your agency more Lou Avery or Don Draper on social media?

Luring clients on social media is different than luring customers. Agencies should use social media to underline their ability to take risks that pay off, making brands trendy while protecting them from controversy. More amateur social media strategies  asking for RTs, jumping on every hot hashtag  dont cut it with clients who want to pay for risk-taking, innovative work. Hitching agency's social channels to trending hashtags, celebrities, or topics could attract more followers in the short term, at the risk of damaging your brand.

**How can agencies use social media to communicate innovation and safety for clients at the same time?**

**Pinch Social** of Toronto has articulated its expertness well on Twitter, positioning itself as an agency with the inside track on upcoming social innovations.

The agency's most popular tweets center on breaking social media news, as shown in the Crowdbabble table below. Rather than engaging in trending topics that could go awry, Pinch shares trending social media news. Change is neither good or bad, it simply is, Pinch seems to say on Twitter, its tone exuding calm and control.

Sharing news quickly emphasizes that Pinch Social is at the forefront of social media innovation, which has helped it brand itself as an authority in social marketing. Agencies can figure out what content is successful with their audiences using Crowdbabble analytics; Pinch succeeds when it's the first to share marketing news.

Pinch Social, like Don Draper, has what are called **"testable credentials."** Don's credentials included legendary creative power and foresight, credentials that clients were invited to test for themselves by meeting him in person and asking him to come up with campaigns on the spot. Testimonials? Unnecessary: Don was so confident in his abilities that he could make them credible by asking clients to test them for themselves. Come see for yourself, Don intoned. His ability to create campaigns on the spot created his credibility. 

Post-Mad Men, agencies make their claims credible by inviting everyone on the internet to test them for themselves  by looking at each agency's own social media channels, a new iteration of Don's catered boardroom meeting. 

Pinch Social's credibility is not certified by experts on social media, but can instead be verified by potential clients when they look at the agency's social feeds. Chip and Dan Heath, in their book Made to Stick, write that a testable credential is created when a brand outsources "its credibility to its customers", asking them to test it for themselves. Come see for yourself, agencies tell clients with their social media strategies. This is an incredibly powerful way to advertise credibility: by putting their social media strategies out in the open, on their own social accounts, agencies invite customers to see what they can do. 

**Public Inc**, another successful Toronto agency, has also carved out a niche identity on social by sharing news. Its most engaging posts focus on positive social news, involving local causes and non-profit groups. Its testable credentials are its credibility, but also its goodness.

The positive slant of Public's social voice makes it easy to retweet; #causemarketing also gives the brand trustworthiness. Like Pinch, Public uses Twitter to establish itself as an authority in social media marketing  an extremely hireable trait for clients.

As Peggy Olson once said, Id never recommend imitation as a strategy. Youll be second, which is very far from first. Bandwagon social media might work for clients, but agencies should steer clear of jumping on #hothashtags every time they come up. Trading trending topics for trending news, Public Inc and Pinch Social have both been able to advertise themselves on social as current and credible.

One of the first things a client will check when considering your agency is your social channels. Along with past campaigns, your own social is a great indicator of your approach to marketing and your ability to build an audience. Building your reputation as an authority in social media, in a unique voice, will impress potential clients.

When stuck between Lou Avery or Don Draper when it comes to social strategy, the middle road could be best. An agency's own social media channels are where its credentials  like credibility and inventiveness  will be tested by potential clients.

Before sharing content on social, ask yourself, "would Peggy Olson put her name on this?" Does this tweet live up to the credentials you advertise to clients? If your content is innovative and cutting-edge, without undermining your credibility, you've hit the sweet spot between safety and risk-taking. Tweet away! </TEXT>

I wrote a piece on hashtag strategies (and how to target different demographics with hashtags) here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/hashtag-analytics-101-find-new-followers/

No article, just the hashtag pyramid idea: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hashbabble_hashtag-analytics-101_hashtag_pyramid.jpg

It basically involves drilling down from very generic hashtags (#love) to very specific (#lovebicyclingNY), layering them to get maximum exposure while reaching customers that might convert.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Weddings: the thunderdome of social media marketing </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-18 16:30:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I put together a case study of two wedding vendors in Toronto to try to figure out how brands in competitive spaces can get ahead. And what could be more competitive than weddings on social media?

Going to the chapel and were going to put it on Instagram.

In the age of #CustomNuptialHashtags, weddings are a bigger business than ever. As grooms and brides publish their weddings online, vendors are put on displayand into competition. The Most Liked Wedding contest is unofficially running 24/7 for all soon-to-be-married 20-somethings on social media. The bloodsport is a huge opportunity and challenge for brands in the wedding industry.

Could your organic naked sponge cake, artistically draped with sage brush, get #CraigAndStephanie4Ever more comments than their BFFs #SmithlyWeds2016? Will your bespoke hand-painted barn wood sign edge #ChrisandChrissie ahead on Facebook for the most liked album in their friend group? The answer might decide whether or not you get hired.

Welcome to the wedding thunderdome, where every like, favourite, and retweet counts.

Getting it right on social media is the key to a steady stream of clients for wedding vendors. There are more than 1,224 wedding photographers, 250 wedding makeup artists, and 400 planners in Ontario alone. How can vendors compete, when social media is awash with picture-perfect weddings?

Full article with images and graphs here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/weddings-the-thunderdome-of-social-media/

**Define Your Brand**

Launching a social media campaign as a wedding vendor can be an intimidating process. How can you compete?

The hashtag #barnwedding returns more than 100,000 posts on Instagram. Mason jar centrepieces? There are millions of Pinterest pins. Perfect blushing bride makeup? Thousands of Facebook posts. How can you stand out?

Developing a successful wedding vendor business means constructing an original brand and voice that echoes in all the work you share on social. Staying generic (#barnwedding! #sunflare!) might work in the short term by appealing to everyone. But it also means that your posts will get lost online in the deluge of wedding content.

Fab Fete Event Planning, a Toronto company dedicated to "all things pretty", uses a very specific type of pretty to define its brand on Instagram. Almost every photo shared has a dose of pink or gold, but most aren't Pinterest-perfect staged pictures.

Fab Fete's high engagement is the engine for the account's follower growth (Fab's current following is 3,097), which extends the reach of its content and helps it find new customers. By tracking engagement rate and other metrics, vendors can find out what content is working and what isn't  which can help you narrow down your style and audience to define your unique voice. Successful brand development requires social media analytics.

Making your content more specific will narrow your audience right down to  potential leads. Your social media audience might be smaller, but engagementand conversionswill be much higher.

**Be a Person**

Weddings are about the love between two people (and how it can be photographed for Instagram).

Wedding content performs best when its posted in the voice of a real person. Vendors, after all, are real people who will be involved in an important day.

Integrating yourself into your social media posts is part of creating a memorable and approachable brand that appeals to people getting married. It's easy to hate high-maintenance brides, but your social media presence has to communicate that you're easy to work with.

Integrating yourself into your social media posts is part of creating a memorable and approachable brand that appeals to people getting married. It's easy to hate high-maintenance brides, but your social media presence has to communicate that you're easy to work with.

Lynzie's personality shines through in her visual style and captions on Instagram. By marketing herself as upbeat and carefree, she can sell couples on bringing her into their special day. Like Fab Fete, posts with her children shows customers making their own families that she shares their values.

Incorporating herself into her brand has kept engagement for @lovebylynzie high, with an average of 111 comments and likes each day.
Customers always factor in the person, not just the product, when choosing a wedding vendor. By tracking your social media performance with Crowdbabble, you can find out how much your audience responds to posts that feature you more heavily.

On social media, vendors have the opportunity to showcase their work and how awesome they are to work with. Doing both will turn social media leads into sales.

**Use Your Competitors**

Partnering with vendors in adjacent wedding categories can help you build your business. They might be competing for the same audience, but they can't steal your business if they provide different services.

Communities on social media are built, like scaffolding, over top one one another. You can use another vendor's audience on Instagram to build your own, and vice versa.
For example, wedding photographer swapping shoutouts with a cake vendor  one who matches their audience, brand, and voice  can be mutually beneficial.

For Love by Lynzie, likes and comments are the easiest to attract when she engages with other vendors. One of Love by Lynzie's most engaging Instagrams over the past month, the rainbow piata pictured above, captured a collaboration with four other brands. In the caption, Lynzie wrote: "On set today with @belairdirect @bemakeful and@blueantmedia teaching you how to make simple, summer fun projects for your next cottage party. I am in love with this rainbow piata we made!" By tagging collaborators in the description, Lynzie capitalized on their audiences  garnering more likes and comments.

What to do with direct competitors? After you've developed your brand, learning more about their strategies with social media analytics can help you get ahead.

First, you need to identify your direct competitors: these are vendors who are going after the same demographic of engaged lovebirds as you are and offering the same services.

Next, create a competitive report (see the blog post for step by step images). By adding their accounts to your analytics dashboard, you can learn from their successes and mistakes. With Crowdbabble, you can discover what your competitor's most engaging posts, hashtags, and filters are. This insider info will bolster your own social strategy with the knowledge of what their (soon to be your) audience loves.

**May the Odds Be In Your Favour**

With social media, wedding vendors  from florists to rented tuba players  are put on display in realtime as guests share images and videos. Weeks after the cake cutting has been Instagrammed, the vendor details are showcased online again as the photographer uploads an album to their website and professional pictures are re-shared.

The constant social sharing cycle for weddings is a huge opportunity for vendors, even though keeping up can be a challenge.

Leverage social media to find new customers by defining your brand, selling yourself, and tracking your competitors. With the plan outlined above, you can use this hyper-competitive arena to your advantage.

In the age of #CustomNuptialHashtags, weddings are a bigger business than ever. As grooms and brides publish their weddings online, vendors are put on displayand into competition. The Most Liked Wedding contest is unofficially running 24/7 for all soon-to-be-married 20-somethings on social media. It's a huge opportunity and challenge for brands in the wedding industry.

Could your organic naked sponge cake, artistically draped with sage brush, get #CraigAndStephanie4Ever more comments than their BFFs #SmithlyWeds2016? Will your bespoke hand-painted barn wood sign edge #ChrisandChrissie ahead on Facebook for the most liked album in their friend group? The answer might decide whether or not you get hired.

Welcome to the wedding thunderdome, where every like, favourite, and retweet counts.

Getting it right on social media is the key to a steady stream of clients for wedding vendors. There are more than 1,224 wedding photographers, 250 wedding makeup artists, and 400 planners in Ontario alone. How can vendors compete, when social media is awash with picture-perfect weddings?

**Define Your Brand**

Launching a social media campaign as a wedding vendor can be an intimidating process. How can you compete?

The hashtag #barnwedding returns more than 100,000 posts on Instagram. Mason jar centrepieces? There are millions of Pinterest pins. Perfect blushing bride makeup? Thousands of Facebook posts. How can you stand out?

Developing a successful wedding vendor business means constructing an original brand and voice that echoes in all the work you share on social. Staying generic (#barnwedding! #sunflare!) might work in the short term by appealing to everyone. But it also means that your posts will get lost online in the deluge of wedding content.

Fab Fete Event Planning, a Toronto company dedicated to "all things pretty", uses a very specific type of pretty to define its brand on Instagram. Almost every photo shared has a dose of pink or gold, but most aren't Pinterest-perfect staged pictures.

Fab Fete's high engagement is the engine for the account's follower growth (Fab's current following is 3,097), which extends the reach of its content and helps it find new customers. By tracking engagement rate and other metrics, vendors can find out what content is working and what isn't  which can help you narrow down your style and audience to define your unique voice. Successful brand development requires social media analytics.

Making your content more specific will narrow your audience right down to  potential leads. Your social media audience might be smaller, but engagementand conversionswill be much higher.

**Be a Person**

Weddings are about the love between two people (and how it can be photographed for Instagram).

Wedding content performs best when its posted in the voice of a real person. Vendors, after all, are real people who will be involved in an important day.

Integrating yourself into your social media posts is part of creating a memorable and approachable brand that appeals to people getting married. It's easy to hate high-maintenance brides, but your social media presence has to communicate that you're easy to work with.

Lynzie's personality shines through in her visual style and captions on Instagram. By marketing herself as upbeat and carefree, she can sell couples on bringing her into their special day. Like Fab Fete, posts with her children shows customers making their own families that she shares their values.

Incorporating herself into her brand has kept engagement for @lovebylynzie high, with an average of 111 comments and likes each day.
Customers always factor in the person, not just the product, when choosing a wedding vendor. By tracking your social media performance with Crowdbabble, you can find out how much your audience responds to posts that feature you more heavily.

On social media, vendors have the opportunity to showcase their work and how awesome they are to work with. Doing both will turn social media leads into sales.

	<TEXT> What are your competitors doing? Use a social media analytics tool to figure out their most successful posts for online (I like Crowdbabble), and for offline, do some snooping. 

What is your target market? 

The ideas below could work, depending on the above answers. 

**Partnerships and events**

Partner with other local small businesses that would be a good match. Buy a onesie at the baby store? Get a free coffee at the diner! Babies are exhausting. Buy a coffee at the diner? Get 10% off at the baby store. 

Cooking classes. Vegan, local, quick and easy, X ethnicity, Y heritage, etc. Really depends on the market and demographics. 

Family dinner night. Dinner at 5, then a classic movie on a big screen (not sure about movie rights). You'd have to be able to do the screen party pretty cheap to see a return. Just an idea! You could do food based on the themes of the movie. Goonie pie, Peter Pan popsicles, etc. Cinderella fairy godmother cookies. 

Any local tour groups? Partner with anyone bringing people into the area and become a stop on the tour. 

Local recipe contest. Have families / people submit family recipes then put the winner in the menu. Get people to submit recipes by having waitstaff tell them when they get their bills -- this is more customer loyalty than getting new customers. Post the ones that look decent on the blog. You could even do a Your Town family recipes book: it is super easy to format a book these days and do the print on demand option with Apple or CreateSpace. The return on this one might be smaller, so you'd only do it if you could 

Special events. Wine tasting night, coffee tasting morning, food "lecture series" but a lot more fun. 

Community support events. Provide free [insert cheap but good food here], and then invite people to use the space for free -- with 10% off drinks. Local theatre opening night parties, for example. People will hopefully order drinks once they're in the space. 

**Food as marketing**

Ice cream cart you can roll outside after lunch on the hot days. Pull a Sweet Jesus and do exciting (but cheap) toppings, like whipped cream or a bit piece of waffle cone.

Exciting new special that's EXTREMELY instagram-able. A spectacle, foodporn type deal that people might travel for. Something like this: https://www.facebook.com/SweetJesus4Life

Exciting, but cheap new menu items. "Exotic" tea flavours, fantastic jams (kitten and the bear, but cheaper, obviously), compost cookies, etc. Doesn't have to have expensive ingredients: http://milkbarstore.com/main/menu/

Try to give certain food items a little something extra without changing the flavours / textures that your customers love. Pies can be a little deeper, and have interesting tops (like hearts), you could give cakes a different look (see milkbar link above). Milkshakes can be served in a mason jar with a fun straw.

Easy value added. Serve hot milk or cream with coffee and tea, put the food on warm plates, etc. Try to stand out from the competition (again, without breaking the bank).

Since you focus on breakfast, maybe something like a tasting menu in addition to the regular menu? Fun new items?  $5 for 5 small coffee samples from around the world? You could buy small batches of beans from costa rica, indonesia, ginger coffee, etc and serve them in 5 little cups. Or something like 5 jams with a scone. Price it based on cost of getting all of that, obviously. Or something fun, like waffle tasting plate (5 varieties of waffle) or pancakes or bacon or whatever. 

Diner high tea. Could become a destination item. In the afternoons on Saturday and Sunday, offer a high tea with a diner twist. Make the little crust-less sandwiches, but instead of cucumber, do chorizo and egg. Instead of scones, do tiny hand-held pancakes and waffles. Serve on the usual three-tier thing. Little old ladies and teenage girls should eat that up. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/AbjttiEt16YQjmpJNV58ou24SBmZbkZFVQDh0MrhMer41mPpVxPbhVI/

Once your food is in shape and you've gotten customers to tweet / Instagram it, solicit local reviewers (even from out of town) for reviews. If you have your special / destination items in place, you'll give them a reason to review it. 

**Go local**

Look into your area's history and maybe come up with dishes that you can serve on landmark days. Name sandwiches over past town heroes or mayors. What's the dominant heritage in your town? Was it created by a bunch of German settlers, or ex-slaves? Maybe create a dish based on those roots.

What is the biggest job / career in your town? Something like 'firefighter's breakfast' or 'nurse's breakfast' with 'powerful fuel' to start the day would be awesome. This could even just be renaming something you already have.

Get really local with new dishes, as with the above ideas. Name things after intersections in your town, big events, whatever. Do not go generic. 

Getting into (or starting) a local foodscene. Local, organic, gluten-free, dairy-free, fancy juices, whatever -- there are a ton of food communities that you could market to or get into. "Crowdculture" marketing is huge on social media. 

A signature dish that makes you the best in the state / area. 

**Review ready**

Testimonials

Put yourself on all the lists. TripAdvisor, state restaurant listings, anywhere. 

Fresh coat of paint / new fonts are a good way to perk up a place on a small budget. Consistent branding is key: the website should look like the store sign should look like the menus. People need to go "oh, I know that place" when they walk past your store on the street, and want to go in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey marketers! I wrote a blog post about Pinterest, using Brexit and Trump as examples -- and Hillary Clinton as an example of how to reach Pinterest's conservative user base. Stats are from the Pew Research Center, which publishes detailed reports on social media usage.

Just the post:

Surprised by the Brexit vote?

Conservative strongholds on social media are often invisible to the typical social media user. If you're a Millenial, your Facebook newsfeed may have suggested that a Remain majority was certain  or that a Trump presidency is unlikely. Social networks popular with young people can seem to confirm that older, more conservative voters arent on social, but that conclusion isnt based in fact: the echo-chamber of closed social networks like Facebook, where your audience is friends who agree with you, can just make it seem that way.

Where are right wing social media users, and how can they be reached?

Millenial overtures about the perils of isolationism on Twitter and Facebook are not being heard, because supporters of Leave and Trump are not on Twitter. Theyre not among your friends on Facebook. Conservative social media users have their own echo chambers, where they can post without fear of harsh criticism from their audiences of friends and family. For Brexit and Trump supporters, that echo chamber is Pinterest.

**The Heartland of Social Media**

Disenfranchised working-class social media users feel heard on Pinterest, a network largely bypassed by the elite that so many pins (user-generated posts posts) vilify. According to a 2015 Pew study, there are three times more women on Pinterest than menthe demographics are surprising, given the network's conservative, pro-Trump and pro-Brexit lean. 23% of black Internet users and 32% of Hispanic Internet users are on Pinterestit's less diverse than Instagram, but almost equal portions of black, Hispanic, and white Internet users have an account. Pinterest has a decidedly diverse and female user base.

The network that celebrates DIY home hacks has a decidedly libertarian streak in its most popular contentplus a healthy dose of nationalism.

Pro-Leave and pro-Trump boards often overlap. They're pinned by the same Pinterest users: the working class who seem to feel, judging by their pins, disenfranchised. The wealthiest Internet users are on other social platforms: 72% of Internet users who make more than $75,000 per year are on Facebook, while only 34% of that same wealthy demographic are on Pinterest, according to Pew's 2014 social media update. Similarly, 74% of Internet users with a college degree are on Facebook, while just 32% of the same demographic are on Pinterest.

Searching brexit on the social network returns both anti-Hillary and anti-EU pins. Strong sentiment about benefits being given to new immigrants (rather than, presumably, poor citizens) are linked to both Brexit and Trump pins. Xenophobia, and content about stricter boarders, are common on both Trump and Brexit boards.

Finding content positive about voting Hillary is almost as hard as finding content positive about voting Remain on Pinterest. Search queries that should return liberal-leaning pins return the opposite.

Pinterest users are less urban than the general population: 31% of Internet users who live in the suburbs and 31% who live in rural areas have a Pinterest account. On Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, those proportions are inverted: a higher percentage of urban Internet users are on the networks than the other demographic. Anger at elitism in government (and big cities) is common on Pinterest boards, as shown in the Brexit pins below.

**DIY Politics**

Even with an official Pinterest account, Hillary is the clear underdog candidate on the platform. She has just 8,900 Pinterest followers, compared to 7.28 million on Twitter and 1.4 million on Instagram. Pinterest users are not Hillary's demographic. Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign do not have official accounts on Pinterest: they don't need them. Pinterest users create and collect enough right-leaning content themselves, and they prefer it that way.  How can she, and other left-leaning causes and brands, reach Pinterest users?

The most popular (repinned) pins have a homemade aesthetic, which lends them authenticity. Unlike Hillarys and Remains slick agency-produced content, Brexit and Trump pins are clearly homemade: Comic Sans, pixelation, and other underproduced choices are frequent visual motifs.

Pinterest users are older; this might explain their disinterest in contemporary design trends. According to Pew,  37% of Pinterest users are 18 to 29, and 40% are over 50. Young people congregate on other networks. 53% of Internet users between 18 and 29 are on Instagram, and 87% are on Facebook.

The homemade feel doesnt undermine the pins, but rather legitimizes them to their older, suburban audiences. Brexit and Trump content on Pinterest is made by a a huge audience  of supporters, while Hillary and Remains pins were slickly produced by hired ad firms  by the much-despised elite often aligned with both. Brett and Trumps pins, in contrast, look like they were made by the people. The overproduced quality of Hillary and Remains content on the network might seem to be an asset: shouldnt social media content look good?

But in looking good, content also looks fakeat least on Pinterest, where DIY = authentic.

It may seem counter-intuitive, but what Hillary needs to prevent Brexit-like upheaval is thousands of pins that look like garbage, but were made by real supporters. Homemade pro-Hillary memes do well on Pinterest, and have thousands of repins. On Pinterest, liberal causes and brands can succeed by throwing out their visual playbooks and embracing Comic Sans.

**Mason Jars, Babies, and Halloween Costumes**

Clinton, and other left-leaning brands, do best when they rely on grassroots contentor create their own content in Pinterest's most popular categories. A pro-Hillary onesie, for example, is one of the candidate's most repinned pins: babies are a very popular content theme on Pinterest.

Pinterest boards and pins are divided into categories, which pinners can use to browse content. Hillary's board dedicated to her new granddaughter Charlotte is one of her best performing, tied with her Women Who Inspire board, with 7,200 followers. Nostalgia is another important content theme on Pinterest  consequently, Hillary's Memorable Moments board has the highest number of followers (7,400), even though it has only 6 pins.

DIY, recipes, and holidays are heavily trafficked categories on Pinterest: the domestic side of life dominates the social network.

Clinton succeeded on the conservative network when she took on a DIY Pinterest trend that might have been used against her: Hillary for Halloween.

Months in advance, Hillary is ready for one of Pinterest's most popular content themes: Halloween. Despite their professional, anti-DIY appearance, the pins already have dozens of repins each. They dominate search results for "Hillary Clinton halloween costume", which could have been unflattering to the candidate.

Donald Trump, who does not have an official Pinterest account, has not taken control of this content theme. As a result, his search results on the topic are far less flattering.

By using Pinterest's Halloween trend to her advantage, Clinton has shown how to control the conversation on Pinterest  even when you're the network's underdog. If Trump, or other conservative causes, wanted to extend reach on the platform, creating an official account and publishing content in Pinterest's most popular themes would be a good first step.

**Marketing in the Mason Jar Belt**

Right-leaning Pinterest users create boards filled with their grievances, from feeling unheard by governments to being left behind by austerity measures. But the user-base seems antithetical to the stereotypical image of the white, male Trump or Brexit supporter. Assumptions about what Pinterest's diverse and female user base wants undermine marketing efforts on the platform.

Social media marketers who want to drum up support for left-leaning brands or causes can learn from Hillary's strategy on Pinterest, and the mistakes of Remain's. Grassroots content and careful excursions into Pinterest's most popular content themes can extend reach on Pinterest, while visuals that succeed with urban social media users on other platforms fail. In the heartland of social media, Comic Sans and Donald Trump are popular because of their lack of popularity on "more liberal" platforms; the DIY politics of outsider candidates, causes, and brands dominate. </TEXT>

Strong sentiment about benefits being given to new immigrants (rather than, presumably, poor citizens) are linked to both Brexit and Trump pins. Xenophobia, and content about stricter boarders, are common on both Trump and Brexit boards.

Finding content positive about voting Hillary is almost as hard as finding content positive about voting Remain on Pinterest. Search queries that should return liberal-leaning pins return the opposite.

Pinterest users are less urban than the general population: 31% of Internet users who live in the suburbs and 31% who live in rural areas have a Pinterest account. On Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, those proportions are inverted: a higher percentage of urban Internet users are on the networks than the other demographic. Anger at elitism in government (and big cities) is common on Pinterest boards, as shown in the Brexit pins below.

**DIY Politics**

Even with an official Pinterest account, Hillary is the clear underdog candidate on the platform. She has just 8,900 Pinterest followers, compared to 7.28 million on Twitter and 1.4 million on Instagram. Pinterest users are not Hillary's demographic. Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign do not have official accounts on Pinterest: they don't need them. Pinterest users create and collect enough right-leaning content themselves, and they prefer it that way.  How can she, and other left-leaning causes and brands, reach Pinterest users?

The most popular (repinned) pins have a homemade aesthetic, which lends them authenticity. Unlike Hillarys and Remains slick agency-produced content, Brexit and Trump pins are clearly homemade: Comic Sans, pixelation, and other underproduced choices are frequent visual motifs.

Pinterest users are older; this might explain their disinterest in contemporary design trends. According to Pew,  37% of Pinterest users are 18 to 29, and 40% are over 50. Young people congregate on other networks. 53% of Internet users between 18 and 29 are on Instagram, and 87% are on Facebook.

The homemade feel doesnt undermine the pins, but rather legitimizes them to their older, suburban audiences. Brexit and Trump content on Pinterest is made by a a huge audience  of supporters, while Hillary and Remains pins were slickly produced by hired ad firms  by the much-despised elite often aligned with both. Brett and Trumps pins, in contrast, look like they were made by the people. The overproduced quality of Hillary and Remains content on the network might seem to be an asset: shouldnt social media content look good?

But in looking good, content also looks fakeat least on Pinterest, where DIY = authentic.

It may seem counter-intuitive, but what Hillary needs to prevent Brexit-like upheaval is thousands of pins that look like garbage, but were made by real supporters. Homemade pro-Hillary memes do well on Pinterest, and have thousands of repins. On Pinterest, liberal causes and brands can succeed by throwing out their visual playbooks and embracing Comic Sans.

**Mason Jars, Babies, and Halloween Costumes**

Clinton, and other left-leaning brands, do best when they rely on grassroots contentor create their own content in Pinterest's most popular categories. A pro-Hillary onesie, for example, is one of the candidate's most repinned pins: babies are a very popular content theme on Pinterest.

Pinterest boards and pins are divided into categories, which pinners can use to browse content. Hillary's board dedicated to her new granddaughter Charlotte is one of her best performing, tied with her Women Who Inspire board, with 7,200 followers. Nostalgia is another important content theme on Pinterest  consequently, Hillary's Memorable Moments board has the highest number of followers (7,400), even though it has only 6 pins.

DIY, recipes, and holidays are heavily trafficked categories on Pinterest: the domestic side of life dominates the social network.

Clinton succeeded on the conservative network when she took on a DIY Pinterest trend that might have been used against her: Hillary for Halloween.

Months in advance, Hillary is ready for one of Pinterest's most popular content themes: Halloween. Despite their professional, anti-DIY appearance, the pins already have dozens of repins each. They dominate search results for "Hillary Clinton halloween costume", which could have been unflattering to the candidate.

Donald Trump, who does not have an official Pinterest account, has not taken control of this content theme. As a result, his search results on the topic are far less flattering.

By using Pinterest's Halloween trend to her advantage, Clinton has shown how to control the conversation on Pinterest  even when you're the network's underdog. If Trump, or other conservative causes, wanted to extend reach on the platform, creating an official account and publishing content in Pinterest's most popular themes would be a good first step.

**Marketing in the Mason Jar Belt**

Right-leaning Pinterest users create boards filled with their grievances, from feeling unheard by governments to being left behind by austerity measures. But the user-base seems antithetical to the stereotypical image of the white, male Trump or Brexit supporter. Assumptions about what Pinterest's diverse and female user base wants undermine marketing efforts on the platform.

Social media marketers who want to drum up support for left-leaning brands or causes can learn from Hillary's strategy on Pinterest, and the mistakes of Remain's. Grassroots content and careful excursions into Pinterest's most popular content themes can extend reach on Pinterest, while visuals that succeed with urban social media users on other platforms fail. In the heartland of social media, Comic Sans and Donald Trump are popular because of their lack of popularity on "more liberal" platforms; the DIY politics of outsider candidates, causes, and brands dominate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly? The best thing for you to do right now is look at what your competitors are doing. Get a free trial of an analytics tool, load up their accounts, and see what their top posts are. What's working? What isn't?

From there, your biggest questions are:

 * **Who are your potential customers?** What are their demographics? What networks are they on? What devices do they use? What media do they watch? Make "user personas" or customer profiles. Maybe your company already has these. 
 * **How can you get to them?**
 * What is your company's current cost per conversion (turning a sales lead/prospect into a customer/sale)? AKA what's your budget?

From there, you're going to build a branding and content strategy. Then, you'll come up with an initial campaign and execute it -- with a content calendar, and social media scheduling tool. You'll then measure your performance (using social media analytics) and tweak as you go.

Suggested toolkit:

 * Hootsuite (to schedule posts)
 * Google calendar or even just a giant whiteboard calendar in your office (to help make your content calendar)
 * Crowdbabble or any analytics platform that lets you manage accounts for multiple platforms, and see into your competitors' statistics

Aside from the strategy side of things, there's the constant monitoring. That in itself requires a bit of strategy: how can you diffuse complaints from customers on social media, and take them private?

In terms of day to day duties, do some research. Google "social media manager" job postings and read them. </TEXT>

Online courses are awesome, but in terms of getting real projects done, the information is too compartmentalized for many. Online courses also have extremely high drop out/non-complete rates: odds are, if you start a codeacademy course, you're not going to finish it.

An in-person course will do three important things: a) access to an expert, b) you can meet people to do projects with, and c) you'll be much more likely to actually complete the course.

	<TITLE> [RESOURCE] A case study on how four small businesses got their social media off the ground </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-20 03:10:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey, entrepreneurs! I looked at the social media strategies of four startups to try to find lessons for the rest of us. How do you build an audience when you're starting with 0 followers? 

Here's a link to the full article, with the images mentioned: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/starting-at-0-social-media-for-new-businesses/


**The Challenge**
Building a brand can be a challenge for small businesses on a shoestring budget. A creative approach to social media can have a huge impact,aat a very low cost. But when you start with zero followers, how can you build an audience?

Many small businesses turn to either buying likes on Facebook or furiously following and unfollowing people on Twitter and Instagram to inflate their audiences, somewhat artificially. This approach can damage your brand at the outset: inauthentic growth will make potential customers question your brands authenticity in other areas. If your online audience is fake, your brand promises, reviews, and value might be fake as well. I looked around the new brands in my own social network and the incubator where Crowdbabble is based to find examples of real growth: of users finding and following brands not just for a #followback, but because they find value in the brand and the content it shares.

The indie businesses below have successfully cleared the first hurdle of social media marketing: building a small, but real audience of fans online. How did they do it?

**Arti Designs Her Life: A Lifestyle Blog**
Arti Designs Her Life is an inspirational blog run by Arti Joshi, where she discusses her journey through the world of following your passions and who splits her time between London and far-flung locations like Australia and Indonesia. The blog launched in August 2015 and has experienced slow and steady growth to 500 WordPress followers and 110 very dedicated Facebook fans. On Facebook, Joshi has achieved what few other small businesses have: an almost equal proportion of shares to likes. Likes require less effort, and usually signal that fans are closer to the top of the funnel  less likely to convert. Because Facebook shares extend your reach to entirely new audiences (they push content onto your fans feeds for all of their friends to see), theyre much more powerful for increasing reach.

45% of fan engagement with Arti Designs Her Life on Facebook is shares. This indicates that her early adopter fans are brand advocates: though the page has a small audience, its very powerful. From March 2015 to March 2016, this highly engaged audience gave Joshis Facebook page an engagement rate of 152%.
Joshis ability to attract such a high proportion of shares might lie in her content strategy: her Facebook page is focused on videos with an inspirational lean.

When Joshi posted two interviews in quick succession, in early March, her Facebook Page Likes increased dramatically. By creating video content and interviewing with bloggers who have more Facebook fans, Arti engaged two active audiences: her own brand advocates, and those of her interviewees. With this approach, her Facebook fan base should continue to grow organically and she should be able to amass an even higher proportion of brand advocates.

**SlimCut Media: Tech Startup**
SlimCut Media is a Toronto-based startup that offers advertising solutions to online media, including news sites. Though its ad solutions boast more than 1 billion page views, translating those viewers into brand advocates on social media hasnt been easy. As a B2B startup, SlimCut faces a unique challenge on social media: its solutions arent aimed at most consumers and their audience is much narrower. On Twitter, SlimCut has successfully attracted followers interested in the companys progress. 

The companys most successful tweets arent about its industry, but about SlimCuts milestones as a startup. Photos and status updates, rather than industry news links, are the most engaging for @SlimCutMedias audience.

According to startup social media expert Brent Stirling, speaking as a person, rather than a faceless company, is the best way for new businesses to grow their audiences. SlimCuts focus on its progress as a team of people, rather than a company in a B2B industry, is aiding its follower growth.

**A Piece of the Party: Videography Company**
This new business delivers on the promise of fun in its name. Its CEO  London-based Lauren Garvey  has carefully built a trendy brand that delivers playful, authentic videos of important events. A Piece of the Partys brand is that its not your mothers wedding footage. Shareable content is built into the business model: who can resist footage of the first time the groom sees the bride, or a snapshot of the flower girl and ring bearer?

On Facebook, Garvey has leveraged this content to build an audience of potential customers. Garvey focuses on lush HD footage uploaded to Vimeo, and personalizes posts by mentioning the first names of the bride and groom. These short highlight reels will help her page continue to grow along with her business. Her engagement rate from 2015 to 2016, when she launched her business, was 109.8%. More recently, Garvey has focused on video content and photos  this strategy seems to be paying off. In May 2016 A Piece of the Party grew fast on Facebook, gaining 20 new fans in one day.

The graph above shows the sharp rise on May 16, when Garvey posted a feature highlighting her videos on a popular wedding site. By celebrating the feature with her followers, she is making early adopters part of her milestones. As with SlimCut media, sharing positive news about the company creates the biggest return for her new and growing audience.

**Climb Out of the Cubicle: Ecourses**
This brand delivers e-courses and organization tools to help you maximize your spare time, realizing your dreams around a 9 to 5. Founder Amber Monaco has created a second shift community on social media, where she organizes chats and shares her insights via blog posts. Social networks are drowning in self-help brands, from companies promising miracle cures in turmeric recipes to bloggers selling $800 conference tickets that promise to change your life. But the success of brands who promote content that only teases other products is often short-lived. Once social media users realize that value is never just one click away, they stop clicking. Customers have become wary of anyone peddling #lifehack solutions; building credibility and delivering real value up front is key to success in this area.

Climb Out of the Cubicle stands out with inspirational content available for free, in Monacos personable voice. Monaco has avoided the clickbait trap by frequently updating her Facebook page with blog posts that are self-contained stories, not behind a paywall.

The audience (and credibility) Monaco built on Twitter, along with her unique content strategy, allowed her to succeed on Facebook. Monacos steady growth on Facebook, where she posts her articles frequently, is a testament to the success of her strategy.

Another key factor in Monacos success? Posting as herself. As social media guru Brent Stirling said, new businesses can find success by posting as real people, so that users can identify with the person behind the brand. Monaco publishes in first person as the business owner, rather than in third person as the business, and this has been key to her success.

Starting at 0 in January, Monacos audience has grown on Facebook to almost 500 likes likes. That may seem small, but her engagement rate is high: an average of 147.5% since January. By giving away quality written content for free and not pushing other offerings hard in her posts, Monaco has avoided the spammy feel that turns off potential customers.

**Lessons for Small and New Businesses**
Slow and steady growth can be frustrating for small business owners growing their brands authentically by delivering real value on social media. Seeing just 5 new likes on a Facebook page or 10 new Twitter followers in a week seems, on its face, discouraging. But if you are growing authentically, those likes are valuable: they represent users who are genuinely interested in your content. 

New businesses do best when they recognize that their audiences are early adopters: users excited to share in the companys growth and be part of its important milestones. These fans and followers  the few, the enthusiastic  are more likely to become customers and then brand advocates. Another key feature is posting as the human behind the brand, not the brand itself: on social media, be a person. With engagement rates of more than 100% and a high proportion of shares and retweets, organic growth will likely continue for the four new businesses above because they follow those two rules.

When you start at 0, attracting 10 new likes or follows unlocks 10 potential new audiences: your brand is exposed to the networks of new fans genuinely interested in your content, and most likely to share it. Startups and small businesses that begin at 0 might grow slowly, but the early adopters who found real value in their brands will be more likely to convert. For new businesses, small gains are big victories. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Starting from 0: A case study of what four small businesses are doing right on social media </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-20 02:06:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey, entrepreneurs! I looked at the social media strategies of four startups to try to find lessons for the rest of us. How do you build an audience when you're starting with 0 followers? 

Here's a link to the full article, with the images mentioned: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/starting-at-0-social-media-for-new-businesses/


**The Challenge**
Building a brand can be a challenge for small businesses on a shoestring budget. A creative approach to social media can have a huge impact,aat a very low cost. But when you start with zero followers, how can you build an audience?

Many small businesses turn to either buying likes on Facebook or furiously following and unfollowing people on Twitter and Instagram to inflate their audiences, somewhat artificially. This approach can damage your brand at the outset: inauthentic growth will make potential customers question your brands authenticity in other areas. If your online audience is fake, your brand promises, reviews, and value might be fake as well. I looked around the new brands in my own social network and the incubator where Crowdbabble is based to find examples of real growth: of users finding and following brands not just for a #followback, but because they find value in the brand and the content it shares.

The small businesses below have successfully cleared the first hurdle of social media marketing: building a small, but real audience of fans online. How did they do it?

**Arti Designs Her Life: A Lifestyle Blog**
Arti Designs Her Life is an inspirational blog run by Arti Joshi, where she discusses her journey through the world of following your passions and who splits her time between London and far-flung locations like Australia and Indonesia. The blog launched in August 2015 and has experienced slow and steady growth to 500 WordPress followers and 110 very dedicated Facebook fans. On Facebook, Joshi has achieved what few other small businesses have: an almost equal proportion of shares to likes. Likes require less effort, and usually signal that fans are closer to the top of the funnel  less likely to convert. Because Facebook shares extend your reach to entirely new audiences (they push content onto your fans feeds for all of their friends to see), theyre much more powerful for increasing reach.

45% of fan engagement with Arti Designs Her Life on Facebook is shares. This indicates that her early adopter fans are brand advocates: though the page has a small audience, its very powerful. From March 2015 to March 2016, this highly engaged audience gave Joshis Facebook page an engagement rate of 152%.
Joshis ability to attract such a high proportion of shares might lie in her content strategy: her Facebook page is focused on videos with an inspirational lean.

When Joshi posted two interviews in quick succession, in early March, her Facebook Page Likes increased dramatically. By creating video content and interviewing with bloggers who have more Facebook fans, Arti engaged two active audiences: her own brand advocates, and those of her interviewees. With this approach, her Facebook fan base should continue to grow organically and she should be able to amass an even higher proportion of brand advocates.

**SlimCut Media: Tech Startup**
SlimCut Media is a Toronto-based startup that offers advertising solutions to online media, including news sites. Though its ad solutions boast more than 1 billion page views, translating those viewers into brand advocates on social media hasnt been easy. As a B2B startup, SlimCut faces a unique challenge on social media: its solutions arent aimed at most consumers and their audience is much narrower. On Twitter, SlimCut has successfully attracted followers interested in the companys progress. 

The companys most successful tweets arent about its industry, but about SlimCuts milestones as a startup. Photos and status updates, rather than industry news links, are the most engaging for @SlimCutMedias audience.

According to startup social media expert Brent Stirling, speaking as a person, rather than a faceless company, is the best way for new businesses to grow their audiences. SlimCuts focus on its progress as a team of people, rather than a company in a B2B industry, is aiding its follower growth.

**A Piece of the Party: Videography Company**
This new business delivers on the promise of fun in its name. Its CEO  London-based Lauren Garvey  has carefully built a trendy brand that delivers playful, authentic videos of important events.

	<TITLE> Turning Instagram influencers into brand advocates: start with the ones who already follow you </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-17 19:50:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys! I wrote a guide on how to find influencers within your own network and engage with them, using a new free analytics app for Hootsuite called Crowdbabble.  I know that "reach out to influencers" is a phrase most social media managers dread hearing, so I hope this can help.  

Article pasted below, but the images are here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/who-are-your-most-influential-followers-on-instagram/

I used Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump as examples, but the suggestions still apply to actual influencers who would be in your network.

**Influencers In Your Network**

These influencers, because they follow you, are already interested in your content and brand.

To access the influencers in your network, log in to Hootsuite and add the Crowdbabble stream to your dashboard. Once youve logged in to the stream using your Instagram account, your influencers are ready for analysis. Most Influential Followers are listed in the Now view. This feature ranks all of your followers by the size of their own following and displays the top three.

These are the followers with the biggest audience on Instagram. Encouraging them to engage with and potentially regram your content would boost your impressions. As a bonus, these influencers are already engaged with your content: to encourage an even closer bond, you should engage with theirs. By clicking on the account name or photo, the influencers account will open in a new tab. Here, you can follow them back and engage with their content.

When you initiate engagement with influencers, you encourage them to reciprocate. This reciprocity builds a relationship that could turn your influential followers into brand advocates. With Crowdbabble for Hootsuite, you dont have to skim through your Instagram feeds for posts from your most influential followers  in some cases, you might not even be able to find their posts, because you dont follow them back.

Using the View Last Post from Most Influential tool, you can quickly find your influencers content and engage with it. Clicking the post will open it in Instagram, where you can engage with it.

Check the Last Post for content that you should like and comment on in order to engage with your influencers. Last Post refreshes any time your top three influencers post, and your Most Influential Followers refreshes anytime an influencer follows (or unfollows) you.

**Find Conversation Starters**

If you understand what topics and hashtags your influencers use the most, youll know what to include in your own content in order to reach them. Luckily, you dont have to study their feeds and ready every post to do figure out what your influencers want to talk about. Theres a better way: Crowdbabbles keyword and hashtag analytics.

In the Content tab of Crowdbabble's main application (www.crowdbabble.com/app/login), keyword analysis displays the words used the most in post descriptions in two ways: a bar chart and a word cloud. These keywords give you vital information about your influencers interests: you can see clearly what they like to post about the most, and what they visit Instagram to engage with.

Lets imagine that @BernieSanders follows you on Instagram and is one of your Most Influential Followers. In the example above, we can clearly see that his content centers around a few key themes:  workers, justice, and liberty. If you wanted to build your relationship with the influencer, you could focus on content and keywords with similar themes.

When you know their favourite topics and hashtags, its easy to create content that connects with them.

**Find Your Influencers Favourite Hashtags**

You can also engage with your influencers by using their favourite hashtags. The second graph in the Hashtag tab on Crowdbabbles main app tells you which hashtags your influencer has used the most. Like the keyword analysis, Post by Hashtag indicates the influencers favourite topics to post about on Instagram  as well as their tone and even their posting locations.

Donald Trumps favourite hashtags on Instagram include: #trumptrain, #trump2016, and #makeamericagreatagain. If @realDonaldTrump was one of your Most Influential Followers on Instagram, you would have a higher chance of catching his attention and initiating a conversation if you used those hashtags.

Knowing the favourite hashtags and keywords of your influencers will keep them interested in your content and encourage them to engage with your brand. Youre more likely to succeed in connecting with your influencers when you personalize your approach. Meeting them on their own turf  topics and hashtags that they care about  ups your chances of turning them into brand advocates.

THE END. I hope that helps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys!
I'm promoting a play that's a mashup of Little Women and Girls. The play has won a bunch of awards and tickets are selling well, but that's not reflected on our Twitter. We decided to go with an satirical approach: tweeting in character from the perspectives of the four March sisters. The goal is to build an audience of people who grew up reading Little Women and now watch Girls.
Have any of you run satirical or in-character accounts? Many of the tactics I'd use on a more 'standard' account don't apply so much here. I will be participating in a few Twitter chats in character, but any other feedback is welcome. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone! I interviewed Brent Stirling of the Ryerson DMZ (voted best incubator in North America) and thought you guys might value some of his thoughts. 

The biggest one is keeping your startup people-focused on social media, and not trying to appear to be a global company right away. The entrepreneur him/herself should be a big part of the content -- rather than a brand tweeting as a person-less entity. Being a faceless global corporation will make it much harder for you to get new followers on social, even though it gives you a certain amount of credibility. 

Whole article: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/the-social-media-secrets-of-brent-stirling-crowdbabble-interviews-a-startup-guru/

Here are the highlights:

Katie: How do you help startups develop a social media strategy thats personable and engaging?

Brent: With most of them it all comes down to, you know, a Venn diagram when youre coming up with content with them. Your content themes are back to your target segment and [they] achieve a goal, but you pick those three kind of circles that kind of make sense for you. If youre a social media analytics company, youre probably talking about social media, analytics, and where youre at: a hyperlocal side to it. Again, **people want to identify with a personality and startups have this ability to showcase their personality behind their brand. Because they dont have a legal team or an HR team, it makes it easier to identify with founders and cofounders.** If you take a picture of your two cofounders and say, were out there pitching these people, generally the crowd tends to get behind you.

The major pitfall that startups fall into is that theyre either in stealth mode, where they dont like to talk about thought leadership or anything, or they dont like to put themselves as the brand. They want to be a global brand immediately. But that runs counter to everything that social is now. Everyone wants to want to back the underdog, they want to back the local team. Showcasing that and building from there builds a really good success story that should be highlighted throughout your social.

Katie: Recently, Harvard Business Review published an article about marketing in the age of social media, about how content marketing is going downhill but engaging in what the author calls crowdcultures is becoming more important. What do you think about that idea?

Brent: I essentially agree. This is why I love working in startup culture: its easier to create a brand personality, and its harder for bigger brands to engage on social  and the HBR article talks about how there are specific personalities like pewdiepie that are doing really well.

Katie: As opposed to Coca-Cola.

Brent: Coca-Cola is a large, faceless corporation. If you look at the overarching trends as to who does well on social, its the Taco Bells and the Old Spices, where they pick a specific person that will be their spokesperson. The idea that you change your actors for each commercial is dying, and everybody wants to I always say that it doesnt matter if its B2B or B2C, its all P2P: its person to person. If you look at Taco Bells Snapchat, its the same people every day. So you start to engage with their personalities overall, as opposed to this idea that this overarching brand exists.

Even with the DMZ, a lot of the stuff that we do I try to insert myself in it, so that people can identify with the person behind the brand, as opposed to just, this is the DMZ brand. And you kind of have to make it personable.

Thats why Taco Bell does so well on Twitter, because it sounds like a person, because it sounds like a person is talking  as opposed to a marketing machine that is churning out the next big tweet. As soon as you start to automate things like that, there was a bot recently that taught

Katie: Microsoft.

Brent: Yeah. There was a bot recently that was taught all of this hate, because they were trying to automate online conversation. **Online conversation is just an extension of what were doing right now.** Unless youre like this online, then generally youre going to tend to lose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone! I interviewed Brent Stirling of the Ryerson DMZ (voted best incubator in North America) and thought you guys might value his insights.

The biggest one is keeping your brand people-focused, and not trying to appear to be a global company right away. The entrepreneur him/herself should be a big part of the content -- rather than a brand tweeting as a person-less entity. Being a faceless global corporation will make it much harder for you to get new followers on social, even though it gives you a certain amount of credibility.

Here are the highlights:

Katie: How do you help startups develop a social media strategy thats personable and engaging?

Brent: With most of them it all comes down to, you know, a Venn diagram when youre coming up with content with them. Your content themes are back to your target segment and [they] achieve a goal, but you pick those three kind of circles that kind of make sense for you. If youre a social media analytics company, youre probably talking about social media, analytics, and where youre at: a hyperlocal side to it.

	<TITLE> What did you guys think of the HBR article, "Marketing in the Age of Social Media?" Article posits that content marketing is dead, and crowdculture will replace it </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-19 18:46:03 </DATE>

	<TEXT> "While promoters insist that branded content is a hot new thing, it's actualy a relic of the mass media age that has been repackaged as a digital concept [...] It turns out that brands have little interest in the content that brands churn out."

The author, Douglas Holt, cites a bunch of examples of massive spends on content marketing that have gone nowhere: Coca Cola is the big example. 

The solution offered: "While the rise of crowdculture diminishes the impact of branded content and sponsorships, it has greased the wheels for an alternative approach that I call cultural branding. The dramatic breakthrough of the fast-casual Mexican food chain Chipotle from 2011 to 2013 (before recent outbreaks of foodborne illness) demonstrates the power of this approach. Chipotle took advantage of an enormous cultural opportunity created when the once-marginal movements that had challenged Americas dominant industrial food culture became a force to be reckoned with on social media. The chain jumped into the fray as a champion of this crowdcultures ideology. By applying cultural branding, Chipotle became one of Americas most compelling and talked-about brands (though recent food-safety difficulties have dented its image)."
