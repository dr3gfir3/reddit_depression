	<TEXT> Whoa, man! You gotta break up the Kubrick. You'll blow your brain.

My honest advice... Pre-assemble your list... Use the AFI top 100 of different genres. Use IMDB. Just pick your 365 titles and then use a computer to select them at random on each day.

RANDOM. You'll thank me for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not an action adventure, but--

**THE LAST AMERICAN VIRIGN**

This has to be the best example of a movie that literally yanks the rug out from under the lead character in the final moments of the film. It starts off as a raunchy, 80's teen comedy and then...

SPOILER: The main character, Gary, has a huge crush on the the hot girl Karen (Monique from Better Off Dead). His more attractive friend Rick (Troy from The Goonies) swoops in and fucks Karen, gets her pregnant and then splits. So Gary spends the entire third act helping Karen get an abortion and then being there for her in her time of need. Karen invites Gary to her birthday party. He shows up with a gold necklace ready to confess his love for Karen, BUT--he catches Karen making out with Troy. He leaves crying and drives away in tears. Then the movie ends. And he never even lost his virginity!

[THIS SONG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9lOfmLXafU) plays on the radio during the closing credits.

The good guy loses big time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First things first... eat 2 meals per day.

Meal 1 = Breakfast = **Oatmeal**. Always oatmeal. It is dirt cheap and will fill you up.

Meal 2 = Dinner = **Chili Mac   Cheese**:

* 4 boxes of generic (store-brand) Macaroni   Cheese.
* 1/2 pound of cheap ground beef
* Margarine
* 1 Quart Milk
* McCormick Chili Seasoning
* Hot Sauce

Directions:

Make the Mac   Cheese by following the directions on the box.

Brown the ground beef. Add the Chili Seasoning halfway through. Drain the fat if you want.

Add the beef to the Mac   Cheese and combine. That should easily last you 5 nights for dinner with a few servings for an optional lunch/snack.

OPTIONS: **Steal**. Fuck it. Steal the McCormick Chili Seasoning. Steal a small block of Velveeta. That's right--I said steal. Steal the hot sauce. Steal anything you can fit in your pocket that doesn't have a security tag. Just don't get caught like a dumb-ass.

Adding some creamy Velveeta to this recipe makes it wonderful. And you can use the money you saved on Chili Seasoning and Hot Sauce to buy fruit and Jello. Then you can make a fuckin kick ass Jello Fruit salad and have that for dessert/snacks all week.

Don't like stealing? You could also go legit and consider buying a **Stouffer's *Party Sized* Beef Lasagna** from Target--They are $10-$11 dollars and have 12 portions. That's lunch and dinner for 6 days with money leftover or Oatmeal.

	<TEXT> Situations can ruin a good film.

I remember when a group of my friends wanted to watch a comedy that nobody had seen... They wanted to watch Hot Shots part Deux. I made them all watch Brazil. Yikes. They hated it.

Since then many of them have revisited it and really enjoyed it.

I suggest getting either drunk or high (whichever you prefer) and have ing a double feature of Murder By Death and Clue. Both are clever murder mystery spoofs with their own little twists. And when you're finished you can weigh in on the age old debate of which one is better. </TEXT>

But even I have to say, the "twist" is more of a shift in genre. The closing shot is necessary, and it's effective... But it's also predictable.

Still an awesome film. Some of Jackman and Bale's best work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for saying this, **Stryyder**.

Having already familiarized myself with the facts about Columbine, I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the obvious attempt to countermand what the NRA said today.

I'm not a gun owner and I don't typically like the NRA, but their logic is hard to argue with--especially when the lives of children may be at stake.

It doesn't matter which guns are banned. Crazy people will use knives if they have no other option. But more than likely they will just use unregistered firearms which they've acquired illegally (after all, if you plan on shooting up a school--a gun violation is a small time crime by comparison).

Since we KNOW it's possible for a criminal to acquire guns, I still want trained and armed individuals in the schools, even if the bans are enacted. Just acknowledging that possibility makes it the prudent thing to do in order to protect the kids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sunshine might be one of the biggest disappointments I have ever experienced watching a film.

For the first 2 acts, I was 100% on board and completely engrossed in the narrative--but then... The third act happens, and some truly stupid writing basically ruins the entire film. The whole third act sucks and as a result, the movie as a whole ends up being pretty awful.

I will say this... If any of the characters had looked into the camera and said "It's daylight savings time" I would probably like it twice as much as I do now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Fall is still highly overlooked by many though. And it is easily one of the best films made in the last 10 years.

Give Tarsem Singh a good script and he'll make an excellent movie.

All of his films look breathtaking, but the majority are, unfortunatly, not really good.

ALSO... One of the most natural and charming performances by a child actor ever captured on film. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit, THE HIDDEN is so fucking great. Saw it in theaters.

This is exactly the type of movie Hollywood should consider remaking... One that was really good despite budget limitations, but ultimately overlooked and forgotten.

I almost walked out of Dark City. I have since grown to love it... I just wish that I could surgically excise William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland--especially fucking Igor Sutherland.

I believe The Wachowskis actually borrowed some sets from Dark City for The Matrix, which would explain why the city portions look so similar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No but seriously.

Most of his answers are like 2 or 3 words... The longest response I saw was 18 words.

99% of the questions were about weed or quantities of weed Snoop Lion consumes.

And almost everybody asking questions is a fucking dork trying to sound "street" or "gangsta" when they talk to Snoop. Losers.

Overall... I was thoroughly underwhelmed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Theatrical Edit of Donnie Darko is the best version of the film. Period.

The Director's cut was such a mess, that I realized Richard Kelly had (like many one-hit director's before him) accidentally made a great movie--aka the Theatrical Version.

When I finally saw his "preferred version" of the film... It was obvious that he was a average filmmaker who had gotten lucky through a series of circumstances-- like being limited by budget, being forced to change the music because of rights, etc. the end result of all of those changes and compromises was a truly great movie.

When most people catch lightening in a bottle they don't jinx it. They hold it sacred. But the truly arrogant will spit in the face of a cult hit and make an absurd amount of "hind sight" changes and re-release the film for what is essentially a cash grab (like George Lucas with Star Wars).

I mean-- calling it a "Director's Cut" is basically a marketing ploy, because the Director's Cut of Donnie Darko never existed. The only main difference between the Theatrical Edit and the Original Film Festival Edit was the order of the music-- which was rearranged theatrically when they couldn't secure the rights for "Never Tear Us Apart". And the commentary on the DVD featured Richard Kelly and--KEVIN SMITH?? Kevin Smith who had nothing to do with the production and played no role in it's success. Marketing.

The Theatrical Edit is a movie that can be watched by 10 friends who can all walk away with 10 different takes on what exactly happened. The Director's Cut is a much more obvious film that really spells things out for the audience. Not to mention, the music in the Theatrical version is MUCH better. No question.

And what has Kelly done since? SOUTHLAND TALES-- a ridiculous, over-indulgent, absurdly unentertaining piece of shit--which is most interesting to watch as an exercise in what NEVER to do if you direct a movie. With that budget, that cast and those resources-- there is NO EXCUSE for not making a more decent film. He proved to me that he is a bullshit director. </TEXT>
