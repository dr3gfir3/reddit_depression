	<TEXT> i got lots of blood work done and that was one of the tests I wanted to do. I've tried pretty much everything to treat my depression including 12 meds, therapy, TMS, ketamine infusions, exercise and lifestyle changes and nothing's worked.

The test as far as I know was just for regular testosterone level. Do you know what level is average for a male my age and weight? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if you get one it will only help for a bit, I've been severely depressed for so long, and I can say that after two relationships in the last two years I felt no better during them. Having sex helps distract you but then you still feel the same after just a couple weeks in a relationship. The only true salvation from depression and the way towards a better life is fixing the root cause of all the pain and hell, whether through medications or other types of therapies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> fuck a fat chick on tinder or something. its a much better and safer option. i know even fat chicks aren't a guarantee to be able to fuck, but they're a hell of a lot easier for someone who is starting out and needs a stepping stone. don't sell yourself short until you message at least like 50 fat chicks on tinder before being able to bring one to a date or house to netflix and chill then fuck. i know its hard af out here bro, im here for you struggling too. but take my word ive struggled months without sex many times and you can always get laid again </TEXT>
