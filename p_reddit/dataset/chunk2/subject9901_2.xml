	<TEXT> In America, it's supposed to be the same. Foreign donations to political parties is not allowed... however, virtually anyone can donate to a Political Action Committee (PAC), or even what's known as a Super PAC, including foreign nationals/companies.

Also, the rule about broadcasting is the same.... The Radio Act of 1934 came up with the "equal time rule," which means every candidate must receive the same amount of air time... but like everything America, we made exemptions to this rule.. Because, well... Fuck rules, we're 'Merica. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is anyone surprised by this?  Internet search companies, like Google, have been using information like this for years. 

Are any of us really surprised that a for profit corporation/service provider wants to sell information to make more money? 

A side question, though.... how would a VPN or proxy server change this, or would that not even make a difference?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difference in punishment vs the Asian scene and the NA/EU scene is pretty simple.  1) The Asian gaming community takes E-Sports much more seriously than NA.  2) Asian punishments for crimes and cheating are way more strict than NA in general.  

Remember the two American teens who were subjected to caning in (I believe Singapore)?  One for theft/vandalism, and the other for chewing gum (if not actually spitting it out)?  I cannot remember if the guy caught chewing gum was actually punished this way, but the first guy was.

	<TEXT> He used to do this a lot more, but stopped as the NA LCS progressed.  Glad to see he's back to it.  There used to be a few top streamers that would actually answer questions, explain why/what they did.  Itemization in certain situations.  Why/when to deviate from "standard" builds, etc.  Dyrus, Voyboy, and WingsOfDeath used to be well known for decent explanations of their play, what they did wrong, what their lane opponents did wrong, and how/why they were able to capitalize on mistakes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wards and Vision </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After watching a lot of the LCS/MLG/etc matches, and now the worlds group stage games... I cannot help but notice two things:

1) Almost all players buy at least a few wards throughout the early/mid game, if not throughout the entire game...

2) Lots of Bronze/Silver players I encounter talk about watching these matches... but fail to notice that warding is not "the support's job."

I'm sure we can all agree vision can win games, or at least set your team up for success...  Sure buying wards can delay certain items... but increased vision can prevent ganks, or unnecessary deaths.  This means the enemy team either wastes times on ganks that fail, or at the very least you deny them gold from kills.  So the tradeoff is actually in your favor for warding.

What can we do to increase people's understanding of the correlation between warding and increasing your team's chance to win? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure why i'm getting so many down votes.... Just saying... getting out alive is not the same as "getting out 'cleanly.'"

I'm sure QuickShot's grasp of the English language is much better than my grasp of any other language on Earth... But... if you're going to use an adjective, just make sure you use it cleanly... and without ambiguity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No matter what happens in any skirmish or engagement... QuickShot seems to think getting out "cleanly" means not dying.  Escaping with full health, or only 10 hps left is getting out "cleanly."  Apparently, the only way you don't get out "cleanly" is to die... no matter how sloppy you play it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From LoL Wiki: Gold equal to 50% of the amount the killer receives is put in a pot which is split equally among all champions who scored an assist.

So, unless it's a decent amount for shutdown, the cost of the ward would generally offset the amount of gold given for an assist.  Given this fact, and anyone who has to roam to drop a ward to get the assist would lose more than they would gain due to not getting the CS... The whole situation naturally deters people from spamming wards and warding to get sight ward assist gold anyway... Unless I'm missing something... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wait...spamming wards around "important objectives" is a problem? Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

As far as people "spamming wards" during a team fight.. if they're there already, they're already going to get an assist, as well as the gold that goes with it.

If you think giving an assist and usual amount of gold for a ward assist is a problem it could be lowered, I guess... But... I play support almost exclusively...   And I can tell you that I get assists for something as simple as throwing a thresh lantern onto someone just before they get a last hit on a champ... The shield doesn't have to do anything... But gives me an assist.

The same is true for any support ability that hits any champ just before they get a kill, no matter how insignificant it actually was in the fight overall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing I would like to see implemented is, if one of of your teammates gets a kill in an area your ward has granted vision, you get some assist gold.  If we get "assist" gold for granting vision of a ward someone else kills, why not "assist" gold for champ kills also?  </TEXT>
