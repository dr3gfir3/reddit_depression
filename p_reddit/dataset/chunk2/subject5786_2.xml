	<TEXT> You have to also remember their cultural traditions were discouraged and suppressed, and mother was split from child with nary a concern.  It's so categorically different than an immigrant, it deserves a different word. I don't actually think he's correct when he tries to redefine the word immigrant and apply it to slaves.

But, personally, I don't think Carson meant anything bad by what he said, it's just that he is content with having a muddled way of thinking about and defining reality.  And that is rightly being criticized.  

On the other hand, this administration has quite a few historical revisionists in it; maybe he is too.  Either way you slice it, though. his words are incorrect.  Sentiment, which I have to think is what you meant, maybe not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Highlights:

 As camera lights flashed, President-elect Donald J. Trump strode across the lobby of Trump Tower with Masayoshi Son, the colorful Japanese entrepreneur, in December.

 This is Masa of SoftBank from Japan, Mr. Trump said before boasting that Mr. Sons SoftBank  which is in the process of amassing a giant $100 billion fund  had pledged to invest $50 billion in the United States and would create 50,000 jobs here.

 ...

 Yet unmentioned that day  and largely unremarked upon  is that Mr. Sons $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund could reasonably be described as a front for Saudi Arabia and perhaps other countries in the Middle East.

 Saudi Arabia is the majority investor in the fund, with some $45 billion pledged. A state-owned investment company from Abu Dhabi, Mubadala Development, is in negotiations to invest $15 billion as well. Qatar is also in talks to invest in the fund.

 This is not a secret to anyone who has been paying even a modicum of attention to the news that has dribbled out about the fund.

 This column isnt taking a position on the politics or the morality of taking money from Saudi Arabia. But it is a conversation that is worth having.

 ....

 In fairness to Mr. Trump, if he does want to bring huge investment sums to the United States, it is hard do that without involving some countries with which we have had complicated relationships. Some of the largest money is tied up in vast sovereign wealth funds.

 Not all of the $50 billion investment that Mr. Son pledged to make here is likely to come from SoftBanks Vision Fund, the one backed by Saudi Arabia. Some of it may come directly from SoftBank, which owns Sprint and is hoping to merge it with T-Mobile.

 All that said, can you imagine if Mr. Trump stood in the lobby of Trump Tower with Prince Mohammed talking about a $50 billion investment in the United States from Saudi Arabia?

 Its hard to see  but then again, stranger things have happened. </TEXT>

If you had to prove this in a court of law, you would by necessity have to show in a clear way every step from start to finish how PP gets their federal funding and spends it on abortions.  You can believe what you want, but proving it works that way in reality is a wholly other matter.  You have to know this deep-down somewhere.

I agree on your last statement though, so hey, we agree on something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree somewhat but yeah that's the frame from within I wrote my comment.  I would still think something of it even if it wasn't Exxon and the company in question had no ties to our government because at the very least it shows incompetence and dishonesty.

And the thing about all the positions Trump hasn't filled... that needs covered by the press more.  He has filled less than 100 of some 1000+ positions that need senate confirmation.  There's only one reason why I can think of which is power consolidation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My claim is this: The bulk of services provided by PP are things other than abortion, and so if federal funding for those services disappears, in lieu of some other funding source, PP will no longer be able to provide the bulk of their services, and thus will have to close because they will no longer have access to a critical stream of incoming cash flow.  Abortion will be then be unavailable because ALL PP services will be unavailable, so it will be indirectly affected.

This seems pretty straightforward to me I'm open to constructive criticism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the federal government did not compensate PP for the services it provides under Medicaid, then they could not provide any of those services anymore.  Since the bulk of their work is not abortion, the bulk of their provided services would go unfunded, so they would have to close.  Consequently, they wouldn't be able to provide abortions.. or any other service.  That's pretty easy logic, is it not? </TEXT>

Don't you think if I was just trying to antagonize you I would have been a little ruder and more dismissive?  I was just asking for something to substantiate what you were claiming, not to make you look bad but so that if I was missing information or misunderstanding the way it works, I could learn.

Lastly, I was separating the services.  I didn't provide a link, although I can if you ask, but there are numerous sources showing a detailed, evidence-based explanation of how PP receives federal funding, and from what I understand, it's done through reimbursements.  So again... if PP sends a bill to the federal government, they list what service was provided.  If abortion was on the list, they wouldn't receive reimbursement.

Now, do you not believe that's the way it works, or do you think that PP is lying when they send the bill, and providing abortions but listing something else?  And/or are you saying they get federal funding in other ways, and they use that to funnel funding to abortion?  

I'm just confused on what you are actually claiming.  Please don't search for subtext in my post.  I'm asking you in earnest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A White House statement congratulating ExxonMobil for increasing investment in Texas and Louisiana cribbed multiple lines from the oil giant's statement without citation.  

 The White House statement, which includes quotes from President Donald Trump, pulled this quote nearly word-for-word from ExxonMobil 's statement:
 "ExxonMobil is strategically investing in new refining and chemical-manufacturing projects in the United States Gulf Coast region to expand its manufacturing and export capacity. The company's Growing the Gulf program consists of 11 major chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects at proposed new and existing facilities along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022."

Here is what [ExxonMobil wrote](http://news.exxonmobil.com/press-release/exxonmobil-plans-investments-20-billion-expand-manufacturing-us-gulf-region):
  "ExxonMobil is strategically investing in new refining and chemical-manufacturing projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast region to expand its manufacturing and export capacity. The company's Growing the Gulf expansion program, consists of 11 major chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects at proposed new and existing facilities along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

This amateurish corruption will continue and worsen until the GOP grows some balls and dispels their myopia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stop trying what shit?  I asked for a clear, substantiated explanation and you did not provide one.  From what I see, most of their funding comes from Medicaid reimbursements.  Meaning, they pay for service, and then request reimbursement for that service from the government.  No abortions services are funded this way unless you are saying the Federal government sees "abortion" as a line-item and cuts a check anyways.

So, is there federal funding that goes to their facilities and staff and if so can you provide a source for this information so I can view it for myself? </TEXT>

Meanwhile, 49 percent said the executive order  which targeted people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  was a bad idea.  
  
 The poll, taken before the White House announced the new version of its executive order on Monday, found that approximately the same number  50 percent  said Trump should have moved on from the ban to other issues, compared with 38 percent who favored his decision to take a second stab at it. The margin of error for the results was 3.5 percentage points. </TEXT>

Otherwise, if it was worth anything, you could use it to explain why an investigation into anything would be neededif only the President tweets that he believes it.  It's a replay of the voter fraud claims, because the same explanation was used to defend his call for an investigation there.  You could just as well imagine up any scenario and insert any question:

*"Why did the President say on Twitter today that he believes Bigfoot is real and caused the protests at Standing Rock... that they are pouring in from Canada's wide open liberal borders?"*

 Look, I think he's going off of information that he's seen that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential, Huckabee Sanders responded. I think hes made very clear what he believes, and hes asking that we get down to the bottom of this, get the truth here. </TEXT>
