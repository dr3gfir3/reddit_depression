	<TEXT> Maybe they should. Though it makes more sense to offer Native people the opportunity to determine their own marijuana laws, as the federal government loves to tell them they're "sovereign nations" and all.

Legalizing it on all federal lands might create a clusterfuck of people trying to sneak onto BLM land to grow pot or something, though honestly not sure how that would work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps no way to stop is rising by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (due in part to the fact that almost nation is willing to address greenhouse gas emissions as a foremost priority). But the article notes they're still aiming to stop increases of 4 to 10 degrees by the end of the century. So there is a way to prevent the planet's temperature from rising, it just ain't happening very fast. </TEXT>

His job wasn't do defend Wilson and prosecute Brown -- though that's what it sounded like. And that's why people are upset and were upset that he was the prosecutor in this case. </TEXT>

Not saying they couldn't have, not saying they didn't, just saying the complaint is concerned about a possibility -- and seemingly a valid one -- not a reality.

	<TEXT> The way the firefighter explained it in the news report is pretty much the way it appears in the body cam. What this shows -- beyond the usefulness of body cams -- is that the actions of bad cops affect (and even alter) everyone's perception of all cops, including the ones who have no intent of doing anything wrong. It's why bad policing is such a big issue and should be treated by law enforcement as such. </TEXT>

"We don't worship the dead in this church, so there'd be no public memorial or funeral to picket if any member died."

I don't see any reason why she'd be lying, unless they've decided they want to create a circus. Which would make sense. </TEXT>

"Billionaire Koch Brother Must Face Suit Alleging That He Falsely Imprisoned Ex-Employee, Judge Rules" would have been more accurate. Apologies for the misnomer, but the point still stands, Koch's attempt to dismiss this case has been rejected by a federal judge. However the case (or merits of the allegations) end up getting decided is yet to be known, but they will at least be considered. </TEXT>
