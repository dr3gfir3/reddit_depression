Ultimately, if the content submitted generates relevant, engaging conversation within the community and the submitter has no other hidden intentions (selling a product, consulting services) I would allow the community to decide.

If a submitter did become an issue, I'd work with the other mods to find the best way to reach out through PM, explain the goals of the community, and hope for a resolution that benefits both sides.

Thanks for the great question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi [/r/highereducation](http://www.reddit.com/r/highereducation/) friends,

Hope you consider me as a Mod. A little about my background...

I'm currently a digital content strategist for a university in the Boston area. I've been a higher education professional for over 6 years, working in Admissions, Enrollment, and Web/Digital Strategy. I've created some sites for the highered community as well, including [FollowEDU.com](http://followedu.com/) (a Twitter directory for Higher Education) and [EDUtweetups](http://www.insidehighered.com/calendar/twitter) (a calendar of Higher Ed hashtags, conferences, and chats - acquired by InsideHigherEd.com in 2011). I share #highered articles/news/content on Twitter at [@subject9013](http://www.twitter.com/subject9013).

I've been an active redditor for over 2 years, participating in subreddits like /r/science, /r/technology, /r/listentothis (I'm a drummer), and most recently /r/bourbon.

I've been doing front-end web design for several years, so I'd be completely comfortable doing a CSS overhaul for /r/highereducation. I love when Mods customize the look and feel ([/r/thewalkingdead](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/), etc.).

To the current Mods - congrats on the continued growth and engagement here! Thanks for opening up a thread for us to volunteer, and once again, I'd love to join the team.

	<TEXT> Here's the recipe: http://foodpluswords.com/2012/03/mini-whiskey-oatmeal-cream-pies/ (used Basil Hayden's as the bourbon)

Ended up just making them open-faced, since the baking tin made the oatmeal part pretty big. Pretty delicious.
