	<TEXT> With a normal SIM, that switch allows you to turn off data use over the mobile network when not on your home network and/or a network your provider designates as 'non-roaming'. Fi seems to override this behavior and always tells the phone you're on your home network, even when out of the country; because either you're in an area with the same data pricing as at home, or you can't roam at all. 

In the US, from the phone standpoint the same is true. You never 'data-roam' on Fi. Although in the US, data isn't charged separately off-network to on whereas internationally it is. Either it all comes out of the big 'ol bucket or you won't have access to data although in the US you may have places where you have voice and text but no data whereas internationally I don't know of anywhere this would be the case. 

Upshot is; in my experience that switch will never have any effect when using Fi. If you want to shut off cellular data you have to untick the "Mobile Data" box.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Partner seems like the only network that has information and services in English. I'm here in Israel right now and prepaid services are everywhere but there's a ton of packages and it can be confusing. 012 Smile seems like the best international deal going. Partner seems to be the only company offering prepaid services in English. I have no connection with them and did not use them.

That said, I decided to use Google Project Fi. At $.20/minute for calls to the US and $10/GB for (slow) data wherever they offer roaming, it's been great with zero hassle. But unlimited 4G/LTE speed data for 30 days seems to be available for about 200NIS or just over $50 from Partner. Killer deal.

	<TEXT> The 5X roaming issues are only with the Sprint side and CDMA roaming. Sprint no longer does CDMA roaming internationally at all. Any roaming is through T-Mobile, and Fi's roaming partners seem to mirror the countries available under T-Mo's Simple Choice. Samoa and American Samoa are not covered, so you'll have no roaming. 

My shortcut to see if I'll be covered now is to search the country on T-Mobile's site.If it comes up as pay per use, I know Fi isn't going to work there. Jordan and is also in that group. 

EDIT: And... I was wrong. The Fi website states American Samoa and the Northern Marianas are at standard rates and don't even list Samoa.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> vent
Long story (kinda) short; Currently overseas for an extended period of time. I have family members in the country I'm visiting that I haven't seen in many years. One of my cousins just had a wedding this past weekend; because the parents of the bride couldn't host me (lots of relatives came in), the father of the bride booked and prepaid a hotel room for me. Incredibly nice gesture, especially considering I could've gotten a taxi ride back to where I'm staying for less.

Upside: The res is at a property flagged by the chain I frequent. Downside: He. Booked. With. Expedia. So no points, no benefits, nada. But hey that's ok. No examination of gift horses in the mouth.

Wedding is shortly after one, so the plan is to be dressed already, go to the hotel, drop my bag and check in later if an early check-in isn't possible. Get there, get in line to check in, and this tall wiry bespectacled prick is just raising hell with the FDA about not being able to check in. Mind you, it's noon. 

He's going on and on about how his flight was delayed and then baggage took forever and the line at border control was forever and then he couldn't get a cab and nothing in this fucking country ever runs properly and on and on. Then the reason for the rant; why can't she give him a room? He's a Platinum and he's never been refused before and they're required to give him a room and he DEMANDS he be checked in right now. After a few attempts to calmly explain the problem, the FDA gracefully excuses herself to go get a manager. Guy then turns and says "I've been a Plat for five years running and I can't believe they didn't have a room ready for me. Totally unacceptable." No doubt he expected backup and support of his entitled attitude.

Well bruh, you opened the door. I said, "Well... I made lifetime last year, and have been plat every year since '01. I've never known early check-in to be a stated benefit. I have luck about 50% of the time if I try to check in early. Whelp, I gotta drop my bag and get goin', now that I know early check-in ain't gonna happen" and walked off. It was as though I'd popped him with a pin. *PFFFFFFFFFFFT* deflated. 

Not sure what was more irritating; the guy haranguing the FDA and dissing the country (which is an incredible place) over normal travel issues, or the embarrassment of sharing citizenship with this asshole.

Every large festival/event I've ever been to where thousands of people are packed into a relatively small area has caused mobile networks to fall over and become mostly useless unless there's a Distributed Antenna System and those are rarely installed except large buildings or arenas. ACL, concerts in Central Park, large graduation ceremonies, etc. 

The exclamation point means that you're connected but not passing data. There's simply too many people trying to connect and pass data and the resultant overload renders the network useless. When I encounter this situation I will switch back to 2G/EDGE data and often get through although slowly.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This may not be appropriate for the TFTFD sub; however I know the sub gets lots of lurkers (including me) so this may be helpful?  
  
The situation as of twenty minutes ago; booked to stay tonight and tomorrow, made mistake and only need tomorrow. We're past cancellation w/o penalty time. Note; this WAS NOT a prepaid res. Those operate by a different and far more inflexible set of rules. What to do??  


First off; stay as far ahead of the problem as possible and, if you can, call during business hours when someone is around that can authorize exceptions. 

If you can't or find out too late?? Don't pitch a fit; call to preserve the next night's reservation and call back the next business day to politely ask if anything can be done. Thou shalt not screw with the folks on the front line for doing their jobs when you didn't do yours.   

This was a few minutes ago after the FD punted me to someone authorized to make a decision:  
 nbsp;

    
   
    R:"Thank you for calling East-in 'Gigantic Proprety', this is [Revenue Person], how may I help?"

    Me:"Hi there, I've screwed the pooch. I have a reservation checking in tonight but just found out I only
    needed tomorrow. I believe I'm past the cxl w/o penalty time. Is there anything you can do?"

    R:"Let me check...clikity...it's no problem, we'll just make it one day and you won't be charged 
    for tonight."

    Me:"I cannot thank you enough for your help, I greatly appreciate it."
    
    R:"Not a problem at all thank you for staying with us, have a great stay!" 

 nbsp;

Now if they'd said no??? I would've taken my lumps knowing I made the mistake. But going in with honesty, zero attitude and zero expectations is your best chance of getting the property to help you out of a self-made situation.

Outboard decoders don't seem to be a thing, HDMI audio de-embedders only convert LPCM to analog, DD+ is universally only passed through.

	<TITLE> How to fix the sound on the Dell XPS 15 9550 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-12 16:18:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just got the thing yesterday and love it, but was dismayed by how bad the sound was. Could Dell really have muffed it that badly? I was determined to at least make the best of the bad so I started noodling with settings, going into the Microsoft enhancements inside the driver, the Maxx audio settings, etc. I think I've come up with a solution that actually sounds decent and allows you to use the full volume range with a minimum of distortion.

Here's what you need to do:

* Go into the **Dell Audio** desktop app, and click on **Speaker/Headphone** at the top.  
* Turn OFF **MaxxBass**  
* Turn UP **MaxxTreble** to taste, I have mine set at 95.  
* Turn OFF **MaxxDialog**   
* Turn OFF **MaxxStereo**  
* Try **MaxxVolume** ON or OFF. It's compression, I don't mind it so I keep it on.
* Use **MaxLeveler** as you wish, I have mine turned off because I hate normalization.  
* Next, click on **Equalizer** on the left hand side.  
* Click the **On** switch  
* Set **31Hz** at 0.7 or to taste.  
* Set **63Hz** at 2.1 or to taste.
* Set **125Hz** at 1.3 or to taste.
* Set **250Hz** at -1.4 or to taste.
* Set **500Hz** at -0.8 or to taste.  

The reason to notch those frequencies is to avoid where (I think) the speakers are resonating with the chassis.

Enjoy! I think it actually sounds quite good this way, has a bit of reach into the bottom, doesn't sound tinny and most importantly DOESN'T crackle constantly! But still does on occasion. Hey, as awesome as the rest of the machine is, I'll take it!

**EDIT:** There's a software parametric EQ that totally replaces the WAVES Maxx software and allows you to make very precise adjustments to the equalization. It also has a pre-amp function so you can boost the volume to your heart's content. It's not the most user friendly piece of software but at first blush seems to work very very well.

	<DATE> 2016-03-09 19:48:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> * **Total budget and country:**   

$1300, US

* **Do you prefer low weight, a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick any that apply.**  

2 in 1 not important, I prefer great performance, decent graphics, good battery life, and mid-low weight

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.** 

Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**   

13-14" IPS/AHVA/IGZO (just not a TN really)

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.**   

Some WoW, some Adobe Premiere

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**   

Primarily WoW, would like to achieve 30FPS at Ultra

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**   


Prefer Synaptics touchpad and solid build quality/non-flex keyboard. Very much want good sound quality from the internal speakers. Realize I may be looking for a unicorn that doesn't exist. I currently have a 1TB 2.5" SSD and a 512GB mini-PCI-E SSD in the current laptop so the ability to move those over would be awesome. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  


I currently have an Acer [V7-482PG-9884](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7238/acer-v7482pg9884-review-everything-you-need) and love it even though it's not perfect. I'd prefer something with a better keyboard (the Acer's really isn't great although it isn't bad). But overall the laptop is extremely well rounded with good graphics performance, very good battery life, good speed, great screen, and surprisingly good sound.  

The size and weight for all this are perfect (13.31" x 9.33" x 0.84-0.92" and ~4.3Lbs). So, any help is greatly appreciated. I've been looking at the Aorus X3 in thoughts that the V4 will be discounted now that the V5 is out, but don't know if that's a suitable replacement.  Any help is greatly appreciated.    </TEXT>

Friend's wife leans over and says "that's a really good idea!" I shoot back without thinking "Yeah, but I'd look like a class 3 limp wrist sitting in that." She doubles over laughing, and it's at that point I realize the guy is one of two dads and overheard everything. I just quietly wimped out and slunk away.

	<TEXT> When last we left off **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/44watd/you_only_need_one_circuit_it_uses_a_smartjack_so/)**, our intrepid something or other was trying to figure out how new ISP *YellowRunFastShortDistance* was going to squeeze a quart of bandwidth through a pint-sized pipe. I'd just called **Regional Manager** (RM) and let him know that issues were indeed afoot. **Chubby Sheriff** (C) had buttoned things up, laughed at me yet again, and bounced off on his merry way. We're now something like a week from cut-over. 
 
 nbsp;

____________________________________

I'd called RM towards the end of the day, so wasn't surprised when I didn't hear back from him until the next morning.

 nbsp;

RM: OkWe'veTaken**MilitaryToilet**OffYourCaseAndYouWillNotBeHearingFromHerAgain.  
  
Me:I appreciate that. So did y'all figure out how to transmogrify a T1 into a T2, do I have more circuits coming, or are we going to use [IPoAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers) for the rest?  
  
RM:IPoAC?  

Me:Nevermind.   
  
RM:YouShouldBeHearingFrom*NewDeathStarBabyBell*ByTheEndOfToday,SoundGoooooodsubject3599?  
  
Me:Wow, how'd you pull that one off?  
  
RM:PleaseLetMeKnowIfYouDon'tHearFromThemThankYou**clik**.    
  
  
 nbsp;
  
  
No sense of humor, that one. But, true to his word, I did get a call from a scheduler over at *NewDeathStarBabyBell* telling me that three circuits were to be installed the next day.  
  
 nbsp;

Bright and late shortly after lunch, **Chubby Sheriff** and his **PFnotsoY** roll in after a lunch of pantagruelian proportions. I only know this as they were talking about it for thirty minutes after they showed.  
  
C: Gawddayum! That thar place'ut jus' opened up'th road dishes sum mean grub amigo. Four ench-eye-ladas fur six bucks, haw!  
  
PFnsY:*Nombreeee*, vato you wouldn' kno' good messican food if it hit you upside th' head. I had hungry man dinners better'n that shit. 

 nbsp;

and so on... 
 
 nbsp;



**PFnsY** was a junior (though not much younger) tech for *NewDeathStarBabyBell* and very diligent and hardworking if not the sharpest tool in the shed. When I'm having to help figure out how to use a [T-berd](https://www.valuetronics.com/detail/Used-acterna-t-berd-107a.cfm?gclid=CJeEwaGL_coCFQIKaQodo_sOvg), all is not well. But so long as things weren't too wacky he got the job done the times he was dispatched solo and had learned enough by the time **Chubby Sheriff** retired to manage. He was also self-described "La Raza" and supposedly rode with the [Bandidos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandidos_Motorcycle_Club). So, not someone to feck with unless it was good-natured. But, I digress. 

 nbsp;

Their end of the install comes off without a hitch, **Chubby Sheriff** and **PFnsY** take their leave, and I hop on the horn

At the instruction of **Military Toilet**, I hadn't connected the router to the one circuit that was installed. Time to fix that.  
  
 nbsp;
  
Me: Hey *RM*, who's coming to turn this thing up? 
  
RM:{silence}...{insert hemming and hawing and prevaricative strategy formation here}  
  
Me:See, there's this clause in the contract that states you guys will be responsible for installation and administration?
  
RM:Uhmmm...UnfortunatelyThatWasToBeAssignedToAServicesTeamThatWasToBeSetUpInYourRegionButThosePlansWerePushedBack.
  
ME:...so you're coming down to install this yourself? It's going to install itself by magic? You have yellow oompa loompas instead??? That you're telling me this now means you knew you didn't have anyone to install it and still don't.   
  
RM:Well...Yes.  
   
ME:*sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*...(holding my head in my hands)...I haven't even so much as looked at the router thinking y'all had taken care of everything. Is it at least configured?   
  
RM:Well...No.  
  
ME:OK...(deeeeeep sigh)...I'd prefer not to sue y'all. Send me a new contract for the same term of time without the installation language, with a 7x24 4 hour service restoration SLA, at {$200/month less than agreed} and we can avoid buying our attorneys new cars. Y'all already waived all the non-recurring charges so there's nothing to do on that front. Get me someone who knows what they're doing with an IOS config and I'll get it running.  
  
RM:ICan'tDoThatItsBelowCost.
  
ME:Do you remember why you cut things to the bone in the first place?  
   
RM:Well...yes.  
  
ME:I'm going to provide referrals as agreed. Whether they're negative or positive is contingent upon you.  
  
RM:.....I'llGetTheNewContractsOverAndHaveASpecialistContactYouTomorrow

ME:I'll get the router set up so we can configure it.  
  
RM:*clik*

 nbsp;
   
So I go climb up to the box graveyard, dig around in the Cisco box, pull out the lovely baby blue Cisco console cable and proceed to get PuTTY running on an older Dell 1U [EDIT: Dell PowerEdge 1550; 1Ghz PIII] server that I'd been too lazy to remove from the rack. All hail King Nine Pin Serial! I'm greeted with:  

    Please answer 'yes' or 'no'. Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]:  
  
Well, feck, I guess **Regional Manager** wasn't kidding.
 
 nbsp;

[I've run out of time, the conclusion is to come.]

**TL;DR: Installation? Sure we'll install it for you! PSYCH!**

	<TEXT> Not in the industry but very sympathetic. Was checking in at a starry wooden property late last Thursday and had the misfortune of being in line behind one of the biggest fecktards I've ever witnessed. Typical middle management type, more important than anyone in the room, etc.
  
  
So, feckyboy (FB), goes off on the poor FDA because he didn't get his upgrade, the rate is wrong, blah blah. As he's blowing his stack, he mentions something like "Look, I'm a Platinum, I work for XXXX healthcare, we're a huge customer and if you don't get this fixed I'm going to have our travel department stop booking here!" 
  
  
Just so happens I know quite a few people at XXXX healthcare as I've been friends with one of their senior executives (let's call him David) since he was a peon. I also am on a first name basis with the CEO (we'll call him Ron) and his wife. All of which I put to good use when I interjected and said "Oh! You work for XXXX? I've known David for twenty years; in fact I just saw 'em at Ron's surprise birthday party about two months ago. Funny, I don't recall meeting you there. What was your name again?"
  
  
I almost felt sorry for the guy;  the color drained from his face as he turned around and stammered out a halfhearted greeting and tried to salvage what was left of his dignity. He didn't mention his name, but FDA came to the rescue by brightly piping up "OK **MR. FECKYBOY** WE HAVE YOU ALL FIXED UP! YOUR XXXX HEALTHCARE RATE IS NOW IN THE RECORD AND I FOUND YOU A KING ON THE STARRY WOOD FLOOR SO YOU'LL BE NEAR THE LOUNGE! WILL YOU NEED ONE KEY OR TWO??" 
  
  
FB meekly squeaks out "^^onlyonethankyou" and FDA ssssslllooowwwwwwlllyyy points out the room number on the key folder, rate, where to find the lounge, what tomorrow's forecasted temps will be, breakfast, wifi info, moon phase, winning lotto picks, etc etc etc all as sweet as can be. Finally, she hands over the keys and FB practically sprints off but not before I can call out "Pleasure to meet you Mr. Feckyboy! I'll make sure to tell Dave I saw you and let him know you're working hard!"

Must credit the FDA on her professionalism... she didn't say a word about any of it. But she did profusely apologize that no upgraded rooms were avail though I didn't ask, and somehow I ended up with four drink tickets. 

I haven't decided if I'm going to pass this along to 'Dave'.\

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A bit of backstory: 

 nbsp;
  
  
Way back when, I was one-man IT for a family business. In the early days of the internets (think pre-WiFi, DSL and Cable when people still debated the merits of modems and Rockwell HCF modems were the bane of the existence of many), I was tasked with Getting Us Online. What to do? We had no network, and I had no budget. Cue 10base2 ThinNet strung about, 'cause the equipment was available for cheap back then (100bT was becoming the norm but was still expensive and Gigabit had just dropped and was unholy expensive) and hubs (much less switches) plus stringing cat 5 would be way more costly than RG-58.

 nbsp;
  
  
So now we were all wired up, with no-place to go. Bless the powers, they accepted my explanation as to why a ton of dial-up was Not The Answer. But, what then??? Unfortunately, the facility was hell and gone from *NewDeathStarBabyBell*'s nearest CO, so a T1 was right out of the question. T-spans back then were (and may still be) charged by distance for the physical circuit, and access (be it voice, data, etc) was separate. The quoted loop charges were insane even if I could get access for cheap. But this new-fangled service, called ISDN, was NOT subject to a distance-based loop charge. For those unfamiliar, ISDN was sold in many places as 2 64k [B]earer channels for data and 1 16k [D]ata channel for signalling. I figured 2 ISDN lines, or 256k bandwidth, should work. 

 nbsp;
  
  
Sadly, said LEC's internet offering wasn't very advanced, and couldn't do bonding. They charged by channel and connect time. So that wasn't gonna fly. Plus, this was a bit of a podunk area and innovation was thin on the ground. I, somehow, managed to talk a local ISP into leasing us a spanking new Cisco 1720 with two ISDN cards for cheap and rolling that into monthly dedicated bonded service. They were primarily a consumer dial-up ISP (first in town with 56k which is why they could also offer ISDN), and in the evenings throughput definitely dropped but when we needed the bandwidth it was there. 

 nbsp;
  
  
For a year or so, this was OK. But then Flash started becoming a thing, web pages were becoming more image intensive, and Broadcast.com was growing popular. None were core business functions but what the powers want, the powers get. And the powers wanted bandwidth. This was perfect timing; $ISP was getting commercially shaky and the service grew progressively flaky. Meanwhile *NewDeathStarBabyBell* had recently started offering Frame Relay dedicated access in our area significantly more cheaply. So out went one 1720 and in came another. This time, we had to supply the router and I had to configure it. So I learned a little IOS. This will become important later. But for now, bandwidth was quadrupled, our users rejoiced, and we carried on.  


 nbsp;
  

Another year and a half down the road, and the screaming begins anew over the slowness. By this time we've got servers and printers and devices galore hung to hell and gone. So, it is Decided that we'll do it right this time, and the Cat-5ization begins. But, our contract with *NewDeathStarBabyBell* doesn't run out for six months, so while we can redo all the infrastructure and be ready to move, we can't actually switch until then AND we'll have to have both running for about a month. They wanted MMMMOOAARRRR SPPEEEEEEED, so all was blessed.


 nbsp;
  
  
**At long last, we get to the story:** *YellowRunFastShortDistance* telco was mounting a big push in the area to gain customers and had been by to see about picking up our dedicated voice business about a month prior (we did a metric crap-ton of inbound toll-free 800 service). 

 nbsp;
  
  
I called the 'rep and said if we got a deal on a 4xT1 circuit, I might be amenable to switching things up when our voice contract came up in about a year. She came back with a price that was equal to what *NewDeathStarBabyBell* would've wanted for the T1 loops alone AND threw in a shiny new Cisco 26something (think it was a 2621?) to handle it all. They were going to handle provisioning, install, everything, and the router was their problem. So they said.

 nbsp;
  
  
Problem: *YellowRunFastShortDistance* wasn't very good at provisioning and had a bad working relationship with *NewDeathStarBabyBell*. I wish I'd known that earlier. Two weeks before the planned cut-over, I still didn't have an install date for the circuits even though the router had already been installed and mounted and was merrily blinking away into the nothingness not connected to a damn thing. This will also be important later. 

 nbsp;
  
  
Increasingly impatient calls to the "network implementation team" and my "implementation specialist" were met with platitudes and insistence that all was on track. The name of the implementation specialist? **I kid you not: think military term for a toilet, with an A appended.** From here on out, she shall be Military Toilet.

 nbsp;
  
  
So finally, FINALLY, *NewDeathStarBabyBell* install tech shows up. I know these guys well, I love these guys, they love me. I frequently send them home with freebies and have cellphone numbers for 'em all. Chubby Sheriff (C) is the one that shows up today. 

 nbsp;
  
  
I call him that 'cause he kinda looks and sounds like a fat Sam Elliott. C has a serious enchilada-fuelled paunch, deep basso profundo voice with a drawl to match, full greying beard, and an honest-to-god handlebar moustache with no hipster-wax required. 
  
  
 nbsp;
  
  

C: Ok, amigo, I gotcherdown fur a T-span teh them sunzabitches. Whyyydjew take them anyhow??
  
Me: Offer I couldn't refuse, you guys were $$$$ more a month AND they threw in the router.  
  
C: GAWDDAMN!!! Welp, we gawdda pay fur all us beeeaaayyyuuutiful techs like this prime spec-I-men ri'cheayah (right here)[slaps his stomach which continues gyrating for a longer time than expected].  
  
Me: Waitasec Sheriff, did you say 'A' T-span?   
  
C: Ayup... wun T-juan, hawt, fresh, 'n made tuh order.   
  
Me: Uhhhhhh, that's supposed to be four there, amigo. I ordered cuatro so if this ain't it I'm sinko-ed.  
   
  
 nbsp;
  
  
  
C calls in and verifies the order is correct. I whip out my trusty Ericsson T39 and whistle up Military Toilet (MT).  
  
  
 nbsp;
  
  
  
MT: *YellowRunFastShortDistance* network implahmentayshuns, this Military Toilet.  
  
Me: MT, we have a serious problem. *NewDeathStarBabyBell* is here and they have an order for ONE circuit. Not four, one.  
  
MT: A'ight, jus' calm down, you know we been tawkin' bout 'dis fo' weeks 'n sumtime da ordahs jus' get put in rawng(wrong). Imma check.  
  
Me:The. Orders. Get. Put. In. Wrong? Aren't you the one that enters the order??  
  
MT:Aw nawwww, we gots uh carrier implahmentayshun leyeaisayon (liaison) team dat does dat. Y'all in uh *NewDeathStarBabyBell* area 'n I cain't put in dem ordahs.*clicketyclacketyclicketyclickety*  
  
MT: MMk, it sez jus' one. Imma call dem. Hol'don.*CLIK*{...calls so clear, you can hear a pin drop...}  
  
Me:(muttered)Motherf*cker!  
  
C:Son, looks like yah's gettin' whutcher payin' fur.  
  
Me:Y'know, we have really big sharp air-knives around here, how much do you like that beard?  
  
C:(laughing)Uh huh, yer sawed off fat ass and who's army?  
  
MT:{...and with our fast clear*CLIK*}M'kay I done tawked t'them 'n they say ya only need wun circut.  
  
Me:**WHAT!?** A T1 line is 1.5 megabits a second. The contract is for 6 megabits.  
  
MT:Naw dis is new, we gawt this thang called a Smart Jack. So it do it all wit' one.  
  
Me:(...stunned silence...)  
  
Me:Did I hear you correctly? A T1 can carry 96 channels of bandwidth because you use a **smart jack**?  
  
C:(doubles over laughing hysterically)  
  
MT:I don' know nothin' 'bout no channels, 'dis ain't cable!  
  
Me:...so no other orders exist.  
  
MT:Naw, dat's all ya need.  
  
 nbsp;
  
  
Now, the sales rep had brought her regional manager along for the call, and he'd given me his card. Thankfully I remembered this right about now and rushed Military Toilet off the phone. As a rule, I never give techs or fellow support people hell. Sales people do not get this courtesy when things go wrong. Sales people are frequently the source of things going wrong.  Called Regional Manager up and raised utter hell.  
  
 nbsp;
  
  
RM:ThisIsRegionalManagerWith*YellowRunFastShortDistance*HowCanIHelpYouuuuuuuu.  
  
Me:This is subject3599 with [redacted], get me someone in engineering, implementations or whatever the **F CK** you people call it that knows what the **F CK** they're doing because Military Toilet, whom you assigned me and assured me was TheBestThingEver just tried to tell me a T1 can carry 6 megs 'cause it uses a, are you ready for this, SMART JACK! We only have one circuit being installed.  
  
C:(loses it and quite literally ROFLs)  
  
RM:ThatCan'tBeRightI'llGetRightBackToYou*CLIK*
  
 nbsp;
  
  
So, Chubby Sheriff, sore from laughing at me, installs our lone circuit, and graciously extends the demarc (Demarcation point, where telco hands the circuit off to you) to the network room. 
  
 nbsp;
  
  
To Be Continued [if anyone actually reads this]
