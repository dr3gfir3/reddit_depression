	<TEXT> Can Someone come fly with me? I keep ending up on the losing side of insanely one-sided games and am getting annoyed. Or, conversely, I do really well in a match and the host ends the game with 5 seconds left. Happened about 10 times today. 
I want to get my MR higher so I can play at a better level, but losing and getting clubbed so much has me down in the mid 1400's.

	<TEXT> Alright, played three rounds last night in the F-4E. Basic beginner stuff.
Woke up this morning and played another three rounds and unlocked the F-14A, my favorite plane of all time. 
Also got my first "drop" (I guess that's what it's called?) of an AV-8B with the "Kim" skin. I guess I'm not high enough level to access it though. 

Went and grabbed a new controller a few minutes ago but the battery is totally dead so now I'm stuck waiting for it to charge.
This is all pretty exciting; I don't think I've ever truly looked forward to getting online and playing a game before. I usually play offline and solo, but this is a pretty cool thing that Bamco has going on!.

	<TEXT> Wired connection fixed the issue but now I've run into a controller problem: If I squeeze the hand grips on the controller too hard, the whole aircraft goes absolutely insane; the gun starts firing continuously, missiles go off two at a time, and the camera spins and focuses in crazily. I guess I'll go over to gamestop and see if they've got any replacement controllers. 
I'm also out of fuel so I can't play anymore tonight  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright so my ps3 in general can't connect to shit. It's sitting literally right next to my 360, which gets PERFECT connection, and the PS3 reads like a 60-80% connection, but if I try to access the PS store or ACI, I can't get past the loading screens. This is bullshit and now I remember why I moved over to the xbox system. I've been sitting in front of this console for like 4 hours HOPING it would magically find a chink in the wifi-wall armor and be able to connect to at least something, but it seems like that's probably not going to happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm late to the party, I know. 

If I already had the Beta version of ACI installed on my PS3, will the game update to the full version when I open it up again?
I haven't used my PS3 in months.

Also, if any of you would like to fly with a serious rookie (at least to this game) and give any hints or tips on how to have fun with this game, I'd appreciate the help. 

thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why have we not talked about ANY of the AI partners from AC4? Omega and Halo squads are both basically cannon fodder in just about every circumstance up until the Megalith mission where they all suddenly grow balls and learn to shoot. 
You don't have a specific "buddy" in that game but holy s***bucket are the AI amazing at either not helping you at all, or dying as soon as possible. I swear at least 20 of them die PER MISSION, if you count the number of "I'm hit! Ejecting!" messages that get transmitted over friendly comms. That's a pretty severe squadron turnover rate. By the time you reach Megalith Omega and Halo squads have likely blown through at least 3 generations of pilots ALL WITHIN THE SAME CONFLICT. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I was playing the beta when I was having the connection issues. I'll see if I can get the system back up and running. All the threads about seal clubbing and high level a-holes gang raping low level players just sounds totally unappealing though. Hopefully if I find someone reasonable to team with I can avoid all that stupid crap.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, Chopper went down in such an honorable way- you know, concerned about the lives of others- that it honestly didn't feel all that bad. 

Four, though, was definitely more tragic, in my eyes, because there's a LOT that can be read into the "eject" order that 13 gives her:
-He obviously saw her get hit and had eyes on her as she likely lost control.
-He really thought she could get out in time.
-He called his wing-mates trying to confirm if maybe they saw something he didn't. 

Denial-stage of grief in its finest and he's staring at her disintegrating Terminator the whole time. 

Aaaaaaaand I'm getting way into this because nobody ever talks to me about this shit. Forgive me; this is literally more than 10 years worth of stuff I've been dying to talk about but didn't have anyone to share with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah I really believed the cards were corrupted and actually just ordered two brand new 128 MB cards as replacements, but, lo and behold, I reset the system clock and -poof- everything came right back. 

I put ACZ in today and was promptly thrown into the last B7R fight against Sorcerer Team and had a hell of a time figuring that fight out again after probably 3 years of absence from the game. 

I need to find a good screenshot of the Razgriz demon when it's pictured in *A Blue Dove for the Princess*; I think that representation is equal parts elegant and intimidating, which is my kind of style.   </TEXT>

If you asked ME that question, I'd tell you three words: "Eject, Yellow Four." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sly, I definitely read that today. I got my PS2 up and working again after realizing what was wrong with all my memory cards; because I had unplugged and moved my console, the time settings reset themselves to 00:00 12/31/99 and the entire thing was literally frozen in place, waiting for me to re-up the clock. Once I reset the time, BAM all my save files came back.

I played through AC5 on Monday and Tuesday, and made it through ACZ on expert today. I'll keep going on ACZ so I can get that 100% complete for the Assault Records. 

This is kind of an aside, but goes along with how strongly I feel about this series: 

I have a friend who loved his Pokemon Red team so much that he got a tattoo of the mon who used the final move to defeat Gary/Blue/Assface. My buddy has a SUPER detailed Poliwrath on his shoulder because of how much he loved that team. I'm seriously considering either a Razgriz or Galm related tattoo as my next ink.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What bothers me the most about Blaze is how easily he gets relegated to trail position duty in high-profile or stress situations. Like, they try to make Edge the flight lead initially, right? And then in November City, it's Edge flying in the 1 position for the aerobatics display. It bugs the crap out of me that Blaze gets so easily bumped to the side when he's supposed to be this ultimate badass of the skies. We don't REALLY hear the squad mates start swooning over him until Aces when Grimm and Snow start fan-boying over him so hard that the ground guys probably got uncomfortable. 

Each protagonist is a total badass in their own right, but the Demon Lord was the only one anyone really talked about truly being afraid of. Thus, my pick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You NEED to play 4. If you have played 2, you will definitely appreciate 4. 
The first time I realized that 4 was back-tracking across the same geography where 2 took place, it was like a literal brain-melt scenario. I was 10 years old realizing that my games interconnected with one another and was so excited to tell my parents about it that I think I woke them up out of bed. They didn't care though, so that's kinda where the story ends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey snake, I'm not currently on any of the ACI servers because my PS3 has been relegated to blu-ray duty due to its HORRIBLE wifi connection tendencies. If I can convince my wife that a next gen console is worth the $, I may spring for the PS4 and go back to the world of flying.  </TEXT>
