	<TEXT> A response from a friend who's a Canadian Social Worker:

He's a very engaging speaker and his opening metaphor comparing the welfare system to the bleeding patient scenario is very apt. 

I agree wholeheartedly with his assertions that poverty is the root of many social challenges that government programs attempt to address, that a new approach (as opposed to tinkering with the current ones) is needed, and that the government has traditionally been more interested in institutionalizing poverty than eradicating it. 

Having said that - and he alludes to this later on - the social problems caused by poverty also cause poverty in a nasty little loop, so programs to address them must still exist. This means that, in his cost/benefit analysis of an income supplement, the costs of these programs can only be partially subtracted from the cost of the supplement and that additional money will have to be found to fund it. I do believe, however, that these costs will be recouped over time 
through the reduction of welfare program costs, health care costs, and other costs to government (as Segal talks about). I also believe that initial costs would have to include "navigation aides" - workers to help individuals in low income (especially in intergenerational poverty) to learn to access systems they have previously had little interaction with due to lack of income (ie: education, credit, etc.) in order to reach their goals. This does not neccessarily have to be new workers dedicated to the income supplement program, but it may be wise during the transition from welfare. In addition, and after these workers are no longer needed, these system navigation tools could be taught as part of secondary education, be offered through pre-existing programs (such as student loan offices, credit counselling, etc), and incorporated into government service offices in much the same; way as learning to fill out a driver's license renewal, etc.

In the same vein, using the tax system to deliver the supplement is a great idea because it will reduce administrative costs and, hopefully, a lot of confusion while increasing the respect of the individuals by not "othering" them into a seperate system from "regular" Canadians. However, at least at the beginning, a recruitment system will be needed to get Canadians living in low income who do not file taxes due to lack of income to do so. 

I agree with the idea of a general income supplement for all of the reasons he discusses. I do think it's failed in the past, and continues to be unpopular beacuse of the conservative values that judge poverty as a result of a lack of personal responsibility or deficiency - the view he describes in his contrasting of left and right. I think a good way to circumnavigate this is to "sell" it to conservatives using a cost/benefit analysis as he begins to here. His logic and examples are good - but in order to really sell it, you'll need harder numbers. 
Attempts to reverse these judgements have existed for decades, but a marketing campaign to remove the stigma around poverty may also be neccessary to sway public opinion and get this off the ground. 

On a related note, all of his descriptions of the welfare system as needlessly confusing, punitive, judgemental, offensive, and demeaning are spot on. 

So, in general, I agree, and hopefully more people will seriously consider this and other new approaches to poverty eradication. 

Sorry for the long response, but you asked for it, and as you'll recall from the lecture, poverty is a very "complex" issue. Thanks for the link, I enjoyed watching it. 

As a side note, I also love the Gardiner museum and had no idea they hosted nifty lectures . </TEXT>

He made a number of really interesting sociological arguments about how the numerous programs designed to help abate poverty actually lead to a marginalization of those who use them.  Plus the economic arguments of bureaucracy associated with delivery of those programs that don't successfully mitigate the problems of poverty. 

I wish Sen Segal was still in the lower house, he seems like a very interesting guy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, it definitely has been a fringe issue to date, and coming out in favor of it has the risks of marginalizing the party that tries with the negative pro-pot connotations of past elections.  It would be a serious message-war, I cringe imagining the political ads.

However, if it has relatively broad appeal, as it seems to now in polls, and if more than one opposition party comes out in favor of at least decriminalization, it could become main stream and 'ok' rather than some fringe policy.  Then, an alternative narrative marginalizing prohibitive policy could potentially win out.

Colorado and Oregon lend a lot of legitimacy to this issue moving away from the fringe, and there could be more state referendums in the US during the 2014 elections. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The legalization of marijuana could end up being an interesting wedge issue in 2015 between the CPC and the other federal parties (assuming legalization is adopted by any opposition platforms).  

The CPC is pretty well tied policy-wise to a 'tough on crime' agenda and highly unlikely to flip on legalization.

As such, they're stuck with only one play of demonizing the use of marijuana as well as the idea of legalization to voters; marginalizing any of its proponents.  Strategically then, if opposition communication is prepared ahead of time and can out-maneuver these tactics, they could come out ahead on this issue (provided the votes play out with the current demographics).

It would be interesting to see polls on legalization specific to ridings won by the CPC in 2011. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, but technically that would just mean there's non-partisan-based precedence that the current parliamentary system is flawed if the sentiment is independent of the party in power.

The purpose of gov't should be to build consensus through elected representatives, not just periodically give power to one half of the political spectrum so they can ignore the other half till the next election.

The CPC didn't invent omnibus bills, or whipped votes, but we're paying our MPs (and soon to be more of them) a lot of money to pretend to be a parliament. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When much of the governments legislative agenda can be pushed through in a single bill, or two; when debate on these hydra-headed monstrosities is itself cut short by government fiat; when these arrive on top of the whole long train of abuses to which Parliament has already been subjected, starting under past governments but with conspicuous enthusiasm under the present  then the question for next year, and for years to come, is clear. It is whether we will still live under a Parliamentary system of government, or something else.

This really put a perspective on things for me for just how dysfunctional parliament has become compared to how it was envisioned and practiced (however badly) until recently.

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. You can give investors tax cuts, but they may still be unwilling to adopt the inherent risk associated with a start-up venture.

Furthermore, incubating new and successful start-ups in Canada isn't just a money problem, but a social-infrastructure problem. New entrepreneurs need mentorship and various forms of encouragement beyond just money (though that obviously helps). Keeping those entrepreneurs in Canada is also a struggle.

Could you elaborate on this? I assume you're referring to [this feature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_question) of american constitutional law (from the Wikipedia entry):

 In American Constitutional law, the *political question doctrine* is closely linked to the concept of justiciability, as it comes down to a question of whether or not the court system is an appropriate forum in which to hear the case. This is because the court system only has authority to hear and decide a legal question, not a political question. Legal questions are deemed to be justiciable, while political questions are nonjusticiable.  

Which decisions by the SCC might have qualified as political questions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was my first consideration too, also being an AB/ON person.  However, from what I've read, variety and pricing is actually better under a public system for liquor.  It's just beer where I've run into issues as a consumer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While this matter seems topical to Ontario right now, the subject of privatization of public corporations is an important political subject at various levels of gov't across Canada.  

Furthermore, liquor privatization, while in this case it's a provincial matter in Ontario, it's a question with precedence in Alberta where it was privatized in 1993-94, making it a good topic for making comparisons of results.

If public opinion allowed the sale of the LCBO today, it could signal to the CPC and other political parties that it's safe for them to make similar attempts at other [remaining crown corporations in Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_corporations_of_Canada#List_of_Canadian_Crown_corporations). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, it's an excellent revenue source for the province.  It's a well-run business, prices are not excessive for consumers, there's a reasonable variety in products.  Plus, based on the conclusions of that report in my previous comment it sounds like keeping the LCBO remains the best policy option.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wasn't familiar with the [Greenbelt](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/11/20/toronto-greenbelt-expansion.html), thanks for bringing it to my attention.

As for whether the sale of the LCBO~~/beer-store~~ would increase government revenue, I mentioned these possibilities:

 If the LCBO and beer store were sold off, the initial revenues of the sale and the economic boost of new companies entering the market may actually increase provincial revenues in the long term (the effects should be predictable, however, for whatever policy is better I think). This is also to say nothing of the effect loosening alcohol regulations on sales of alcohol (i.e. being able to buy a beer down at the corner store) would have on revenues.

There's probably an independent report floating around somewhere... here's one from [1994](http://www.yorku.ca/nuri/lcbo.htm) done by a prof [Nuri T. Jazairi](http://people.laps.yorku.ca/people.nsf/researcherprofile?readform shortname=nuri) in the economics department at YorkU.  Perhaps outdated, but sounds like privatization doesn't win out: (from conclusions sect. 17)

 Under liquor control, revenues are greater and prices are lower than under privatization, other things being equal, because of economies of scale. The privately-owned outlets are fragmented, and require higher rates of return on their capital costs than control boards. 

 Selling the LCBO to private owners would not help in reducing the provincial debt because LCBO assets are a small amount relative to the $80 billion debt.

 Privatization in Alberta has resulted in higher product prices, smaller product selection, higher warehousing and distribution costs, and higher social costs. Alberta Premier Ralph Klein has conceded that the ALCB privatization is "counterproductive".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll admit, when I consider alcohol privatization, I'm taking the perspective more of an average cough consumer...  :)

Monopolizing alcohol distribution puts ~~inherant restrictions on the varieties of beers and liquors and spirits that can be marketed~~ (**Edit:** Apparently overall variety can be measurably higher under a public system, I was considering more small businesses with more niche selections, but that result isn't necessarily a foregone conclusion of privatization).  Makes it more difficult for smaller and regional breweries to enter the market.  

If the LCBO and beer store were sold off, the initial revenues of the sale and the economic boost of new companies entering the market  may actually increase provincial revenues in the long term (the effects should be predictable, however, for whatever policy is better I think).  This is also to say nothing of the effect loosening alcohol regulations on sales of alcohol (i.e. being able to buy a beer down at the corner store) would have on revenues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, a lot of our government structure is based on [tradition, convention etc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system)  It would be nice if we could innovate government the same way we do anything else.

I read this great series of books about [setting up a government on Mars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy) after the first colonies are settled there.  Really made me consider how obtuse some of our conventions are becoming over time.  I made this comment in another thread yesterday:

 I've been considering lately whether federal politics should continue to be driven by a system of local geographical ridings. Why not have a system (especially with the internet today) where if a person can get a certain number of votes nationally, whether in a local city/town or broadly from across several provinces they would be awarded a seat in the HoC.
Municiple and provincial politics could continue to be run the same way, but nationally I feel like I might have more in common with people in Newfoundland and Vancouver than my direct Neighbourhood about who I want representing my interests nationally.

I'd rather vote with you Palpz on putting a representative in the HoC than my neighbours that I've (perhaps ashamedly) never met.

	<TEXT> Constitutional changes are actually enormously difficult, the failure of the last two big pushes for constitutional changes, the [Meech Lake Accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meech_Lake_Accord) and the [Charlottetown Accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottetown_Accord) are pretty good evidence of that.  I worry sometimes with how rapidly the world is changing that there aren't more flexible gov't mechanisms to make adjustments.  

That being said, Chrtien [made a good point](http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/chrtien-criticizes-quebec-culture-of-grievance-over-82-constitution/article4100813/?service=mobile) earlier this year when he said:

 *I don't think a constitution should be something that can be amended very easily because that becomes an excuse. You know, you just pretend that the Constitution will cure all the problems of the world and, if you use it, you don't debate the real solution of the problem.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like your suggestion that increased urbanization alone is a potential factor on median male incomes due to competition.  That would actually make for a good economics study I think.  

I don't believe his measurements of innovation are necessarily accurate either, it's a little too anecdotal to say we're not as innovative as 50 years ago just because consumer goods and appliances remain fairly pedestrian compared to their counterparts from the 50s.  Biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials; there are research areas exploding right now, they just aren't as visible as the consumer electronics handset market.  

However an interesting topic brought up briefly in the talk and not really discussed at length is the fact that with tomorrow's innovations in automation a large portion of traditional unskilled labor will disappear.  Standard of living should still be high, I imagine, but what the average individual will do for a living could be very different... As an example of this, imagine those google self-driving cars, now apply that to the trucking and shipping industry.  A fleet of trucks with no drivers that can go 24h/day.  If this technology is licensed, suddenly every trucker in the world has to figure out what they're going to do now.  

So, where increased competition could be mistaken for stagnation, what will obsolescence look like... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like to think that if systems like this were popularized in people's kitchens, there would be a dramatic reduction in waste, just because the food in these printers is in a preserved state.  So much of the food produced in north america right now doesn't get purchased and eventually just gets chucked out.

If less of the current food production can be used to satisfy the needs of more people in this manner (i.e. less waste), that leaves room for a lot more freedom in how food is grown.  Biodiversity, organic production, environmentally conscious farming...  A lot of negative aspects of agriculture today are driven by a persistent global food shortage.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regarding 3D printing and automation: 
 
* That level of automation frightens me a little in and of itself.  When we've reached that point you realize traditional labour on earth will have disappeared.  I don't know what most people will be doing for a living by that point, unless 3D printing and distributed manufacturing becomes a success (as per next point).
* 3D printing is definitely an exciting prospect, if only because the business model around small-scale distributed manufacturing vs. traditional large-scale mass-production adds the potential for so much creativity and diversity in the stuff we have around us.  I really want one of [these](http://www.wired.com/design/2012/09/how-makerbots-replicator2-will-launch-era-of-desktop-manufacturing/). :)

Regarding privatization of space:

* This also makes me nervous, but at the same time, if there aren't commercially viable reasons to go out there, then we will probably never go and that would be the real tragedy.  
* A frightening idea to consider is how if space exploration does 'take off' in the 21st century, it will primarily be developed nations that go, and as such developing countries may be forced permanently into a back-seat role economically, and social inequalities could multiply in severity.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is disappointing that funding over time has been curbed, but a lot of western countries have struggled with where to take their space programs in the last couple decades.

The [Canadarm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm) is a good example of how on a limited budget, but with a clear focus and project goals, we can still make a real contribution to space exploration.

Another good example is the [MELISSA long term life-support system](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Melissa/) that was pioneered by the European Space Agency.

With various agencies taking on different parts of the puzzle on how to successfully traverse space, a lot of headway can still be made.

The emergence of private companies in the US like [SpaceX](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/10/spacex-iss-cargo/) and the proposed asteroid mining company [Planetary Resources](http://www.planetaryresources.com/asteroids/) adds a new and exciting dimension with the prospect of commercialized space exploration.  Hopefully similar start-ups can occur in Canada possibly beginning through the CSA... </TEXT>
