	<TEXT> I love Varsity. I found them through browsing random music on YouTube.  I get a Strokes vibe from their music.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 'Teaching students to make socially aware games'

Aren't video games meant to be about having fun, not pushing political ideologies? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love it! I think for me it's the movement in the flooring, it really draws the eye. And the slight tilt of the cabinets, and angles of the chairs. I almost feel like I'm about to walk into that cabin!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have an Instagram right now, but I'm planning on getting one soon to put pictures of all my stuff on. I'd like to have an online shop at some point, too. What style of art do you like to draw in?

I love cats, so I'd hate to be allergic... :'( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I turn 20 in the next couple of weeks. Currently halfway through my degree in English Lit and Creative Writing. I make textile jewellery and constantly fail at writing short stories. I have a cat that snores very loudly.

Good luck with your degree. I'm pretty good at sorting out computers when there's a problem, but I'd be hopeless at degree level!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like art and drawing, but I can't say I'm brilliant at it. I draw faces, but in kind of a semi-realistic style, onto felt, and use fabric to make hair, and then cut out the design to make into brooches.

I like bunnies, but I currently have a very lazy cat who snores a lot. Good luck with college and your degree in the arts. :) </TEXT>
