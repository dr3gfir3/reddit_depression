	<TEXT> I'm trying to use a proxy with selenium webdriver.  For example, here is one proxy 209.193.89.213 with port 34836.  This link is telling me how to do it : http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#using-a-proxy

If I am getting this right, all I have to do is change 

    PROXY = "localhost:8080"

to

    PROXY = "209.193.89.213:34836"

along with changing "http://localhost:4444/wd/hub" to "http://209.193.89.213:34836/wd/hub"
correct?  **Any help is greatly appreciated.33**  Sorry if this question seems annoying </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What Can I Do With Dell Precision Workstation 690? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-18 22:52:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone, I received a Dell Precision Workstation 690 from a relative.  It's kinda big and has 8GB of ram, upgradeable to 64 GB of ram.  But I looked into it with crucialscan and the RAM is old DDR2.
I thought it'd be a nice project to work on for my first buildapc, but as I look into it it's kinda old by computer standards.
Here are the specs: http://www.dell.com/us/dfb/p/precision-690/pd

**Can I really modify it that much to a nice gaming setup without changing the motherboard?  Can I even change a motherboard on something like this?  Any help is greatly appreciated33**

EDIT: 
Here is the Memory scan output: http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/scanview/8755F31031D926C3

I have two cores with 3.00ghz and 2.99Ghz

Here is graphics card: http://www.amazon.com/DELL-Geforce-Heatsink-fan-X8764-heatsink-fan-X8764-HEATSINK-FAN/dp/B0045JNI92

It came with 8gb of RAM, upgradeable to 64gb of Ram, so I thought it'd be a good first buildpc choice to tinker with.

The only choices are super expensive?  I see that they have been tested for it, but is there any other RAM alternatives that I can get that are cheaper??  Any help is greatly appreciated3 </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Troubleshooting] DVI madness in Dell Precision Workstation. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-14 21:04:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Building my first pc, starting with a dell precision workstation t3500.
I know it works, but I want to first hook it up to a monitor so I can do some system scans.  Trouble is, it's a bit old, and I don't know exactly what cables to use.

It has a Dell Nvidia geforce 7800 graphics card, with these ports on the side:
http://sishardware.com/imgs/a/b/d/x/w/dell_nvidia_geforce_7800_gtx_256mb_pci___e_dual_dvi_x8764_3_lgw.jpg

So I see two DVI's and an S-video port.  Now, to use that, do I need to find a dual cable, or a dual cable plus an S-video port, or can I just use only one of those?  I have a tv with an hdmi input so I was just going to buy a Male DVI-I to Female HDMI adaptor and just use an HDMI cable.

Also, that DVI has 21+5.  Can I use a DVI 21+1 and ignore those 4 squares in the picture, or does it have to be a certain type?  I was planning on buying this:http://www.amazon.com/BlueRigger-Speed-Adapter-Cable-Meters/dp/B004S4R5CK/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics ie=UTF8 qid=1439578687 sr=1-3 keywords=dvi+to+hdmi

Any help is greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yes, and then overlay it using a tracking scene.  Make it all appear right before the action in a smooth transition.  The hole you see after it breaks could be another footage of the cabinet with its doors open overlayed after the action.  Basically its

Regular scene  --SWITCH to 3D Setup --ACTION -- Mix of footage with doors open and broken 3d setup overtop.  

For the second footage I am putting in, I would open the cupboard doors, cover the doors with green to remove it, and put the 3d overtop of it so I have broken doors plus the interior.  

sorry if that sounds convoluted! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When your current life situation is bad, and you're sitting in bed not wanting to start the day, I think of this quote by Charles Bukowski.  It makes me feel like no situation is really important but yourself and love.  Here it goes:


**"We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing." - CHARLES BUKOWSKI** </TEXT>

Not a problem.  I think the day 1 material would be common, so if you really want to make it stand out you should show a bunch of tutorials, like maybe quick project-a-day type posts where you show how to make neat stuff with the newly learned stuff.  I think most people learning programming are not looking too far into the future and won't be that interested in high level stuff.  But you could always break the blog into a Newcomer and Advanced sections. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Looking to make something that is almost exactly like this: https://elliott.codes/wiki/archillect **

As you can see, it utilizes API, decision trees, and eventish actions,
so I am not sure if it would be better to make with javascript and Node.js or Ruby with eventmachine socket.
Any advice?  Bonus points if anyone could give me a quick blueprint of what steps they would do or how they would approach this.

**Thanks for any and all advice!! Love this subreddit!!** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a thought I had while I was watching the women's world cup today.  I'm a 5'5' male, 180 pounds and definitely do not feel as if I am in shape.  Not looking to look great, but looking to definitely know that I am in shape.  Anyone have any good quantitative test for this?  I'm sure there are heart rate tests, but any such as "being able to complete XXXXX in XXXXX minutes."  Thanks for the help! </TEXT>
