	<TEXT> I think eventually 2D / 3D games are gonna peacefully love together, like Movies and Tv shows. 

It is weird you having those issues tho. True, I use my rig only for gaming and nothing more, but usually it's ready at first try. Have you tried a clean install? 

So far Elite Dangerous has kept me in the Vive the most. Let's see when some 2D games will come out that I'd like to play more! No Mans sky I'm looking at you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought it was anti-social but then, the whole demo experience for newbies is a social game, plus rounds of Space Pirate Trainer is a great party game (come and beat me!), if you haven't tried, look up Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, it's an amazing co-op game with one person in VR trying to defuse a bomb and the other outside trying to guide the defuser - it's so funny!

I found that the 0.65 trick actually does the job. I can play with 1.8 SS in Steam and 0.65 in E:D with a mix of LOW/HIGH settings which allows for great enjoyment!

	<TEXT> I think you might have bought it too early, as you've noticed yourself. If you don't have a high from trying a brand new tech, and complain about early access games (which I totally understand, not passing judgement here) then I suggest you might try VR "ports" - games that were not made originally for VR but play nicely with it.

First would be Elite:Dangerous. If you remotely like space sims, then this one is a must with HOTAS. Holy hell, I've been dreaming of piloting my spaceship since I was a little kid.

If you like cars, you might try Assetto Corsa or Project cars.

And if you like exploration/mystery, you can try The Solus Project or A Chair in a Room (psych horror). 

I'm sure those ones will let you love your vive until more polished content is out :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me too. I am ok to spend 60/70 euros on AAA 2D games if they deserve it (like The Witcher), so if you gave me same level of story and quality, I'd pay double. 

Regarding locomotion: I just hope that different locomotions are implemented for the same games. Just lock people out of cheating locomotion when in combat (teleportation would break it, as you could always teleport on the back of the monster).

Ive been thinking a lot about this with a friend, and since no one in real life is as fit as Geralt, devs just need to introduce bullet time combat. Give me a bar, make me combat, every hit/dodge fills the bar, when bar is full everything slows down but me. 

Then give me a 3rd person replay and let me enjoy my badassness.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-08-01 13:14:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ...and the marriage is still amazing :) 

I'm not compulsively buying every new release on Steam like early days, and am starting to play 2D games again (I'm looking at you, The Witcher:Blood and Wine). 

But, my headset is so much into my routine now; if I can choose between a VR game and a 2D game, I'd still play the VR one. 

I'm playing a lot of E:D, and will finish soon The Solus Project; still playing SPT for the fun, Thrill of the Fight for a bit of cardio (together with Longbow) and the odd game of Pool. 
I'll never finish A Chair in a Room, too scary for me apparently.

The only 2D game I'll be playing in the foreseeable future are The Witcher and No Man's Sky (albeit the latter can conflict with my ED playing, and NMS being 2D only... I hope I won't regret preordering).

I'm now patient enough to be waiting for the 1080ti and am ready for AAA VR games. It's amazing how quickly VR entered my gaming routine! 

One area of improvement: social interactions   virtual tourism. For as much as I like Altspace VR and RecRoom, I'd like to see more "quiet" environments to participate at events such as debates, TED Talks etc, and virtual visits to art exhibitions, museums, Time-traveling to crucial historical events (OASIS here we come). But that's my personal preference!

How's the VR honeymoon ended for you guys?

**EDIT: So many experiences! Please do keep sharing. I wanted to say that even if the honeymoon is over, I still love my Vive like day 1 - it's just a more mature relationship now :)**

I preordered the latter even tho with limited time there's space only for one of such games in my life; so far ED wins (and not just because NMS is not out yet :D) thanks to the VR integration. Piloting your ship with HOTAS and HMD is so satisfying... NMS has to get VR integration to compete on that level! </TEXT>

Valve did the right thing with the Vive; they're not hindering VR, they're simply protecting their R D.

	<TEXT> So I took up my first sentry skimmer mission. I should destroy 3 of them. I actually grab 4 different missions for the same thing for a total tally of 800k. 

I guessed it was easy. The heck it is. I don't even find those things. I enter with my SRV, destroy some turrets, even manage to collect some data (worth 700k, for me that's golden). 

Then, my SRV gets shot FROM THE UNDERGROUND. I cannot shoot those invisible turrets, but they can shoot me. 
I run to my ship, and try to fly over the outpost, but same thing apply - actually my shields go down very quickly, hull at 5%, I ran away. 

I tried this three times, same result. I don't even know how those Sentry Skimmers look like, how why turrets from underground can shoot me :(

Any help is appreciated!

	<TEXT> Which part of "be yourself" didn't come through? 

Mine was a comment against the standardization of fake beauty, not about how you want to look like, nor was I saying that *everyone should look like the girl in the picture*. They should look *natural* like the girl in the picture.

There's definitely a correlation between how you want to look like and your cultural pressure. I say, resist the cultural pressure, because it's created to make you feel not-perfect.

I am happy with how I look, and if you were to tell me to look more like the guy in the picture, meaning what I mean = be natural, then I'd agree with you. I groom myself but no chance in hell I remove all my body hair like a newborn baby just because advertising says so.

If you're happy with who you are and how you look, then it's great. But don't follow unattainable beauty standards or you'll never be happy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **First**, you can state your point without being rude. Life's hard as it is, there's no need to give out for those small things. :)

**Second**, the product (HTC Vive) is a commercially available one, albeit first-gen (and hence with little spread). It is perfectly supported by the two biggest, most widespread engines around (Unity and Unreal). Frontier uses their own engine (Cobra).

**Third**, by providing feedback to Frontier, and letting them know how many people are affected by the issue, /u/Geirulrf might help both the VR community and the developers to revise their priorities.

That's it! I think it's good to let Frontier know how many people are actually affected by this "issue". Even if a gen1 product, VR is amazing, and once you try E:D in VR that's all you want to do.

	<TEXT> You can still find this kind of beauty. Especially in northern Europe (Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark) or if you like, latin countries (SouthAmerica, Spain, Italy). 

Unfortunately, the beauty standard for UK/US/Australian women has been artificially modified to follow impossible standards, set on purpose by corporations to sell more beauty products - because no one can actually look exactly like they said you should, you're doomed to buy useless stuff forever. 

So pre-teens already want new boobs, new nose, new face. In the end, natural beauty is replaced with fake-constructed one. Also, this kind of beauty (the fake one) also doesn't play well with ageing, forcing women to look 20-something forever.

sorry about the rant :)

	<TEXT> Ma e' la vita che e' cosi. Non sto dicendo che deve essere cosi sempre, ma e' cosi - se vuoi qualcosa, lavori duro per ottenerla. Punto. 

Vuoi laurearti? non ho niente in contrario a stare a casa con i genitori, anzi. Pero' utilizza questo "privilegio" per laurearti in tempo. Non abusarne. E questo vale per qualsiasi cosa.

Vuoi andare via di casa? Trovati un lavoro e vai. Vuoi anche laurearti nel frattempo? Peccato, dovrai studiare molto e avrai poco tempo libero. Se sei davvero bravo, in 3 anni hai finito la prima laurea e puoi trovare un lavoro migliore. Sempre se studi qualcosa che ti porti ad un lavoro e non cose assurde che non servono a nulla - in quel caso, studia pure, il sapere e' importantissimo, ma non hai bisogno della laurea.

La mia vicina di casa e' una ragazza spagnola di 28 anni. Ha un figlio di un anno e mezzo, lavora full time, e la sera va anche alla scuola serale. Il suo compagno e' francese, e nessuno dei due ha la famiglia vicina per aiutarli. Come fanno? Si rimboccano le maniche. Una sera studia lei, l'altra sera va in palestra lui, si danno il cambio. Quando vogliono uscire assieme, chiedono di tenere il bambino agli amici (me incluso).

Basta con le scuse, se si vuole qualcosa, ci si rimbocca le maniche, si lavora duro. Se hai due braccia, due gambe, e mezza testa, puoi sostenerti da solo ed ottenre praticamente qualsiasi cosa.

	<TEXT> Io ho vissuto da solo a Napoli, Milano, Parma, Reggio Emilia, Roma. Mi sono sempre pagato affitto e bollette. Vengo da una famiglia che non poteva pagarmi l'universit. 

Ora vivo in nord Europa. Ti assicuro che uno stipendio da cameriere in nord Europa  proporzionato stipendio/spese tanto quanto in Italia. I ventenni qui fanno cos. 

Inoltre, la vita  molto pi cara in nord Europa, quindi al massimo kudos to them. 

Il fatto che tu abbia dismesso il mio commento dicendo che  una 'cazzata' dimostra poco rispetto e arroganza.

Nessuno qui stava suggerendo di andare a vivere da soli senza i mezzi, infatti si parlava di trovare un lavoro. Troppa fatica? Welcome to the real world. 

Anyway, it's a free world. Enjoy.

	<TEXT> Andare a vivere da soli, anche solo per un periodo, e' formativo. 

Lavorare e pagarsi bollette e affitto, se anche fosse solo per un anno, vale tantissimo nel percorso di maturazione di un individuo. 

Ovvio ci sono compromessi da fare, e la lezione e' proprio questa - imparare a fare compromessi. Non posso permettermi l'appartamento in centro? Vado a vivere con altra gente. Non mi piace vivere con altra gente? Vado a vivere piu lontano.

Ho poco tempo libero per divertirmi perche lavoro e studio? Tempra il carattere, cosi apprezzi il tempo libero ancora di piu. 

Io sono assolutamente per una vita piu "comunale", intesa nel senso di condivisione di spazi comuni come le famiglie di inizio 900. Ma ci sono tantissime sfumature ed esperienze che vanno esplorate prima di scegliere come vivere. 

Il mio puntare il dito contro i genitori che pagano l'universita fuori sede non e' relativo al fatto in se - era relativo al fatto che tale opzione fosse stata suggerita come "soluzione" ad una persona che non vive una situazione familiare facile. 

Non parliamo di ragazzini minorenni; se hai diciotto anni e vuoi andare via da casa, trovi un lavoro e vai via. Come fanno tutti in nord Europa. Non c'e' bisogno della sovvenzione di mamma' e papa'.

This kind of beauty is lost. Nowadays girls are taught too hard by the media to look sexy, that they don't anymore. 

Ladies, if you're reading: be yourself, be natural, don't fake plastic tree your body.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry about your problems. I'm a IT engineer and I know troubleshooting random problems can be painful. 

I think you should check if the system updated ANYTHING automatically yesterday. Windows updates, other 3rd party updates that could have screwed up. 

If you can, revert to a moment in time where everything worked and disable automatic updates. 

You've tried pretty much anything from a software perspective but a clean system install. Try this as a last resort to rule out software issues. 

If a clean install doesn't solve it, we're looking at hardware issues. 

If you have a friend with a capable machine, bring the VIVE to him and test it. If it works, you can rule out a faulty VIVE/lighthouses/cables (bring your cables!)

If the vive works at your friend's, then it's your computer. 

First culprits for me would be: cabling somewhere is failing, CPU is failing, PSU is failing, SSD is failing, RAM is failing, MB is failing. Not all at once :) but in this order usually. 

Troubleshooting Hardware is a pain. I hope you'll solve it with a clean install. 

Keep us posted! </TEXT>

They don't want to reveal things and I get why, but it's a full on AR headset which apparently can do VR as well (I don't know how good it will be tho).

The known things is that uses a technology that delivers light beams directly into your eyes. I'm very curious to see this when they'll deliver (which I'm sure they'll do, too much money invested). Don't expect it to be a consumer version tho. This might very well be the 10k headset that you get to try at fairs and is used only by super-specific pros. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys,

the title says it all, I wanted to use ANUBIS VA pack as it's free so I can try it, but I'm worried about key binds.

I use a Thrustmaster FX HOTAS and have custom-bound it. ANUBIS asks to change the .binds file. Does this mean I'll have to re-bind everything manually again? 

Is this true for every voice pack, or are there voice packs that will work without modyfing my button binds?

One question for those of you with an HTC Vive: do you use the standard ViveMic? 

And last question: do you need to bind a key to start VA in ED, or is it always listening?

Many thanks to all of you commanders, fly safe out there.

	<TEXT> You're completely right. The issue with Lighthouse is that you need sensors on the tracked object, and power to send the signal to your computer. So any tracked object will need to have a battery and to be charged; of course we will see them, but in time. My guess is we'll first see a tracked Steam controller and a tracked keyboard. 

Constellation is easier to implement and I'm sure they'll 'copy' Sony and put out a tracked xbox controller out soon.

VR and cockpit games are a great marriage, it allows us to play fully fledged non-VR games in such a cool way. 

I love this. And I love the Solus Project, which wasn't made for VR but works perfectly. The issue we're having is not VR itself, is ~~lack~~ scarcity of polished content. This disappears as soon as you play a full game (Elite, etc etc). 

When we'll have the first AAA games built ground up for VR, poor my life.

	<TEXT> I hate to be that guy but... no, we won't get 4k per eye commercial HMDs anytime soon (3/5 years?).

Foveated rendering + eye tracking will improve performance greatly, but still in the range of 30 to 40%. That's not enough to drive two 4k screens at 90FPS even with a 1080.

Maybe with a 1080SLI (one card per eye) that might be possible, which of course, reduces the possible market so much that you are looking at specific use cases, not at a consumer product.

Now, if of course someone will make a 4k per eye headset, and you have the money to buy 2x1080ti, you're still stuck with unoptimised software. But the little content you'll be able to enjoy in 4k will be awsome.
