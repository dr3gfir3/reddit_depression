EDIT: look at the USA. we brought people here against there will, and now white supremacists want to keep them out of their communities and the country. that is not leaving people alone. That is dominating others. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is post-grunge rock/2000s style modern rock still a thing? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-03 21:07:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was in high school and middle school, I used to listen to modern rock stations, mostly filled with post-grunge and pop punk stuff.  I havent listened to that sort of thing in ages, but I was feeling nostalgic and wanted to see what was happening in that realm. Wikipedia's article stops listing history items stop around 2008 or so, and on the radio I noticed that post-grunge isnt what "modern rock" stations play for the most part any more.

Is this style of music still a thing? or am I limited to pandora's "2000s rock" station forever

Edit: I know most people do not fondly remember this genre/era of popular rock, but whatever </TEXT>

But it doesnt mean that we should bend over and take it from trump for 8 years. We can fight, we can get involved, and we can work to build a strong blue base, to not lose too many seats in 2018 (or who knows, maybe gain some), and to retake the presidency in 2020

EDIT
and yeah, when we see someone unqualified being appointed to a major role in politics, we can fight that, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> just like constant impeding on Obama slowed down republican popularity?

of those 10 states, they arent all solid red. WI, for example, has blue cities which account for a lot of the population, and an unpopular republican governor. Just because trump was able to beat clinton doesnt mean that republicans can win against democrats. Some of those wins were due to third party votes against clinton, voters who could likely vote dem in those states

It will be more clear in a year or so, but lets see how trumps national popularity is looking down the road.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Scooby Doo mystery incorporated showed the perfect way to get a modern audience to care about scooby doo. By incorporating newer tech, combined with a 60s/70s aesthetic, and a somewhat satirical take on the characters, they made a show which is both enjoyable to kids who want to watch scooby doom and older audiences with fond memories of it as a kid. 

The movie could have done the same, by presenting a burtonesque neo gothic (but still goofy) aesthetic, and allowing the inherent silliness of the characters to stand on their own. That and having them played by younger actors, combined with a script that is funny, could have made a good movie </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the book "bloodlines" (in the current canon) introduces a lot of things about the rise of the first order, the resistance, and the republic. While I know no one (except me) wants a super political star wars, some of that books plot should have been present in the film's first act, or at least alluded to. 

Basically, after mon mothma retired, the republic grew increasingly partisan, with no powers given to their head of state (for fear of a future palpatine), and they grew ineffective. Ultimately, planets that had been imperial loyalists during the empire and persuaded their new political allies to donate and store money in such a way that it funded a new group of fascist neo imperials. The republic still lacks the political will to pass bills to build anything more than a basic security force, so Leia broke away to form a militia army with other ex rebels.  

Its a good story, but it needed to be conveyed somehow in the movie </TEXT>

I recommend 3 brothers. if you skip appetizers and wine, the dishes are about $20-$30 each. the atmosphere is cozy and it has a great old world vibe. Plus the food is great.

If you get some appetizers, wine and such, the date might end up closer to $100-$130 total, but it is still more affordable than a lot of places </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i mean, everything is subjective. However, you can look at critic scores to get a general sense of quality. Compare the top grossing films of 2016 (http://www.the-numbers.com/market/2016/top-grossing-movies) to the highest rated films of 2016 (http://www.metacritic.com/feature/film-critics-list-the-top-10-movies-of-2016).


There is zero overlap in the top 10. Deadpool appears towards the bottom of best rated films this year (25 or so) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a white, straight middle class man. I've never felt like I couldn't be proud of that. I'm proud of my ancestors who came over at the dawn of America, as well as those from Ireland and Poland. 

Being proud of who i am doesn't make me unable to see how the white majority has oppressed various minority groups. I can advocate and fight for my fellow Americans while still being proud of who I am and where I come from. 

That you couldn't feel proud to be Catholic before now is more indicative of something problematic on your end. If you, as a human, can't empathize with the pain inflicted by djt, that's a bit problematic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not fair. Many people, even feminists, could agree to this. Child support needs to be overhauled as a system, since it right now can be incredibly harsh on low income parents. 

Until we have some sort of universal health care and universal child care, rendering child support payments obsolete, we need to keep the welfare of the child in the forfront. It isn't fair for the child, to miss out due to the father not wanting him. Is it unfair to father's? Sure. But we need to keep the child first.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right that things are improving, but consider your place in all of this. White people are generally low risk, upper middle class is low risk, and straight people are low risk. Things are already uncomfortable for people who do not fit that mold, and things could get much worse.

I have a cousin who is a devout muslim, and dresses in a somewhat traditional style (despite being born in the USA). Should people opposed to the middle east, or muslims in general, feel emboldened by an increasing anti islamic foreign policy, he would be at risk. 

I have a lot of friends and relatives who fall on the LGBT spectrum. Should gay marriage be rolled back, as it could based on who trump appoints to the SC, they would be at risk.

The past 8 years have seen some great strides, but a lot of the good things are still very new. Just because your life is boring, a lot of people are not comfortable, a lot of injustices still exist, and things could get a lot worse based on how things are handled right now  </TEXT>

I mean, it is soon for something being done about it. Not that this isnt worthy of alarm, but even in the best circumstances, washington is slow to react. Everything takes time, whether its elected officials working to get the nuances of a bill figured out, or lawyers putting together a lawsuit to overturn the executive order, or anything like that.

If/When trump ignores the courts or congress, then he have a problem.
