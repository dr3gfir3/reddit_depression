	<TEXT> No, the clock rings only once. After that i have 2 or 3 separate lucid dreaming sessions, waking up and going back in, about an hour each. I am beginning to think i am not really lucid dreaming but just dreaming that i am lucid dreaming :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started waking up 5 hours into sleep and then falling back into lucid dreaming intentionally. Works like a charm, however something strange happens.

As I fall asleep trying to stay aware that this is a dream I can feel my body transitioning into sleep state - almost fainting. My hands and legs feel like they have no more blood flowing.

On the other hand when I am waking up I can feel my heart racing and my body being very warm, sometimes sweating a little bit.

I am curious if this is normal and known to be safe?

Also is it strange that in my dreams there is always a hand holding me from behind?

Thanks a lot for any answers. </TEXT>
