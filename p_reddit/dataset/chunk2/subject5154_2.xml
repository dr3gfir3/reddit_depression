	<TEXT> Instead of criticizing emotionally, try to find out the root cause of this announcement, one reason is that KSA has no real singer and no real national cinema able of producing films, so they are worried about their younger generations, yet by a single search you can see some subliminal messages in songs especially if you reverse them. But some may say I am a fan of KSA but I am not, if fact, I hate Saud dynasti, but this should not shadow my judgement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shi'ism and Christianity are similar in many ways, especially their history, the history of Islam is a repeat of the past with new actors, just need a rational comparison:

Moses(pbuh) told sons of Israel that I am going to mountain and in my absence Aaron(pbuh) is my sucessor
MUhammad(pbuh) said:I am dying and in my absence Ali(pbuh) is my sucessor

In the Absence of Moses(pbuh) people chose Samiri and cast aside Aaron(pbuh)
In the Absence of Muhammad(pbuh) they cast aside Ali(pbuh) and chose Abubakr

After many years God sent Sons of Israel a savior named Jesus(pbuh), some believed in him and some rejected him, those who believed in him became Christians and those who rejected remained Jews and tried to kill him so God hide Jesus(pbuh) and will send him back in the apocalypse.
After many years God sent Muslims a savior named Mahdi(pbuh) and some believed in him who are Shias and some rejected him and tried to kill him who are Sunnis, God hide Mahdi(pbuh) and will send him back in the apocalypse alongside with Jesus(pbuh) </TEXT>
