	<TEXT> I think the banks should have gone into some kind of "managed" bankruptcy where they were kept alive but wound down. The depositors should have been paid their insured deposits and that money would have been deposited with more healthy institutions who would have lent it and carried on their normal business. Overall the money would flow around better and the losers would be allowed to fail in a controlled manner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right that we all bear responsibility and we do. People lose their homes or other security when they can't pay a loan back and although that's tough it's the only way that you can keep some integrity in the financial system and let the bad debts be cleansed.

However, the TBTF banks have made sure that governments of whatever stripe work in their interests. The Bush administration had Paulson from Goldman Sachs and Obama Timothy Geitner from Golman Sachs. The regulators don't care what goes on as they simply move on to work in a well-paid job in the very financial institutions they are supposed to be regulating.

But don't take my word for it. Listen to William Black who was a regulator in the 80s during the S L crisis

	<TEXT> I am over-generalizing indeed, but IMO it's undisputed that the banksters (not necessarily the whole financial industrial but the TBTF banks that have their people installed at all levels of government and both the major political parties) held a gun to the head of the politicians and said gives us the money or we fuck everyone up big time. How much fraud do you reckon these TBTF banks have committed over the past 10 years and how many execs have gone to jail since 2008? </TEXT>
