	<TEXT> Hi, I know I'm late, but I just wanted to chime in something about the pattern. Kadaspala inscribed some kind of code, and that helped him create the god's soul. How, I have no idea. 

But anyway when writing the code Kadaspala made so the god only had one purpose, and that was to kill. Draconus asked Ditch to be the god's eye but also in a weird way I remember him telling Ditch try to reason with the god, since the thing that Kadaspala made was crazy. So when the god gets ready to kill, Ditch convinces him that Rake is doing something honorable and something to the effect of "hey this guy is being cool, that one is the douchebag" and so the god stabs Kadaspala. 

This is just one of those wtf things of the series but honestly I loved that section. That imagery of the child god, was...macabre.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, the characters are not the strong suit in Gotm. All I can say is that from the second book onward they are written much better, and that includes the dialogue, even though sometimes it's meant to be obscure on purpose.  </TEXT>
