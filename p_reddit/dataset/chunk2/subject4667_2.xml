	<TEXT> I just started on celexa last wednesday. Ive never been so tired for so long. I slept most of yesterday, went back to bed at 930 last night and slept until 10am this morning and im still exhausted. I cant get anything done feeling this tired. It's crippling. On the upside my depression is gone, but at the expense of my energy levels. I cant tell which is worse. They both suck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im 28. I started feeling symptoms at 18. Diagnosed as BP2 at age 21. Ive been through probably 5 depressions, the latest one being most severe (finally got celexa and its working) and maybe 2 manic episodes but not insanely high.  I have a long way to go, and if i hadnt gotten my meds, im sure (as usual) i would have blown that statistic away over time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't felt joy or happiness in a long time, but today I did a photo shoot with my son using only my phone (Galaxy s7) and a white sheet with some LED bulb lights I made using supplies from Walmart, and I felt great! I had a great time doing it, and they came out amazing! Just thought I'd share that if you can find something you enjoy during a depression, something you've never done before, you may get a break from feeling so down.


Here are a couple of the pics.

	<TEXT> I was only fired once from a past job. I guess you can only be fired once from a Job.. but anyway I started working for employers who know before hiring me what to expect. I do a hell of a job while I'm okay, and they're willing to work with me to get healthy again when I'm depressed. I've been given a month off in my current state until I can get on medication and feel better. Look for a job that is flexible and talk with the hiring manager about your condition so they don't put you in a critical position and can work with you when you have any problems. It'll remove a lot of stress from your life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same. I put us in a hard place because when I'm normal, I'm highly successful so we make great money together and buy things we can afford in the moment. Then I lose my shit and all the expenses fall on her and stress her out when I can't work, which makes me feel even worse. So it's an evil endless cycle and she does everything she can to keep our life from falling apart and losing everything we worked so hard for. It sucks. Really hoping meds will help me soon. Running out of savings to afford our current expenses fast. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I bought things in my depression just trying to feel something... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-27 06:39:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been spending money like I have a week left to live. I'm desperately trying to fill the void in my life with things I thought would help me feel better, or at least get a quick break from the constant depression and feel a hint of joy. Unfortunately most of the things I've purchased and always wanted haven't made a difference, other than emptying my bank account. So a warning to everyone: not just manic phase cause spending. Watch your depressions too. Buying things won't help you feel better.


On that note, I got a new 55" led smart TV, [Adopted a super sweet dog] (http://imgur.com/DwYZF8e) that I will be registering as an emotional support dog (she actually has helped out SO MUCH and gives me a reason to get up and get out) and a drone that I'm trying to learn how to fly, if I don't break it from frustration because I keep crashing it 5 seconds into flight, and GTA V for my Xbox One. The only thing that has helped is my dog. She's amazing. I recommend it if your situation allows it to adopt a sweet dog who will love you unconditionally and doesn't care if you have a bad day. 

Thanks for reading. Hopefully I'll be through this soon because I don't know how much more I can take.

	<TEXT> Anytime I see a fat person riding the electric scooter in Walmart, I inspect their person to see if they're really severely handicapped and can't walk, or just lazy fatasses who don't feel like walking. On a similar note, those people who leave their shopping carts in parking spaces instead of in a cart return. You just walked around an entire store with that cart, and out to your car. What's another 30 feet max to put it where it goes so it doesn't roll away and hit someones car?! I hate lazy people.  </TEXT>

I shared it with my parents who are struggling to understand what it's like. I laughed a few times because I can relate to everything you're going through. It's nice to finally see someone who gets me and knows what I'm experiencing. Thank you soo much for your generous effort to help us out!! </TEXT>
