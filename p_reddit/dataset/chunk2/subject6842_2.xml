	<TEXT>  Does this mean that the law has already been passed?

No it hasn't been passed yet.

 So they already have medical marjuana then? Colour me confused.

The situation *is* quite confusing. The 40 patients who receive medical marijuana do so via pharmacies which use cannabis extracts or compounds containing THC to mix specific medications. 

What this law is supposed to change is that pharmaceutical companies are now allowed to use cannabis compounds in drugs directly. Until now this had been forbidden by the "Betubungsmittelgesetz" (Narcotics Law), Now the pharma industry could potentially have mass produced prescription drugs approved which use THC. As far as I know only one drug like this is in the pipeline right now - by a Sativex by the British firm GW Pharm. [source in German](http://www.fr-online.de/wissenschaft/cannabis-arznei-made-in-germany/-/1472788/4566440/-/index.html)

They specifically say that this does not change the situation concerning non-medical use. </TEXT>

Also, there are other ways of opt-outs. For example you can issue some kind of pass for free which everyone can fill out and check whatever (s)he wants or doesn't want.

	<TEXT> You have great strawmanship but that doesn't tell us **anything** about the issue in the article. (Also: How does linking to many articles about the same topic - some citing the exact same AP wire - make you any more convincing? Hint: It doesn't.)

I don't think I have to say much about that. Some of it looks like conspiracy theory with, as of now, no real evidence whatsoever (which of course the conspirators would hide anyway and so on..), some is about other criminals who convinced some people to sell their organs and didn't pay afterwards. Even if both are true it only tells us that people can be evil. How is that relevant... or new? There was nothing about organ *donation* at all.

About your other argument: Let's look at it from a point of logic. You have a doctor who's treating a patient who is most likely going to die soon due to his condition. The patient is a designated organ donor. 
What happens? Will the doctor [insert trollface here] kill the patient, take the organs (like, immediately) and run to the next guy who is about as likely to die from whatever condition he is in? Obviously not.

* The doctor treating the dying patient probably doesn't even know the candidate for transplants because there is a certain process (which only begins after death) to go through, as well, and candidates are probably some place else
* How is the donor more important to the doctor than the donee? Keep in mind that the doctor probably only knows his own patients (and their relatives) and that success rates of transplants are pretty ambiguous, too.
* Giving up on a patient isn't easy for any doctor - it's hard on you, your conscience, your colleagues and causes insane amounts of paperwork.

One more thing:
Even if the process would begin before death: Transplants depend on the organs to be in as good a shape as can be for as long as possible because the quality of the organs and the success of the transplant depend on it - you could say that potential donors might even have more time because of this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The influence of Catholicism in the country (at least historically) has led to a greater reliance on religious groups to provide many services.

That's certainly only a miniscule part of the story. Firstly, Catholicism's influence does only exist in southern Germany, the rest of the country is either predominantly secular or protestant, though not really keen on going to church.
Secondly, it is kind of true that "religious groups" (meaning groups with affiliation to the church(es)) provide many services (especially things like caring for the elderly or disabled) but it's actually the state/public health insurances which pay for them. Some of these organisations are non-profit, some aren't.

For instance, while some European countries provide child-care services, Germany eschews such programs because of the Catholic belief that women should stay home and care for their children.

You can't be serious. There have been major programs to get nurseries everywhere in the last years. Eastern Germany, of course, has always had them with the western parts lacking behind somewhat. But in no way is the Catholic belief that woman should stay home and care for the children still dominant. (86% of children between 3 and 6 yo were in kindergarten in 2006) I admit, though, that especially in the western/southern part of Germany a lack of nurseries is still existent.
By the way: Fathers who stay home to take care of their child can get compensation, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the issue is that all these things happen in almost every game and in spite of that they don't get 5 minutes of injury time. The decision is justifiable but it seems to miss consistency with all the other games then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to a [WHO site](http://www.who.int/countries/rwa/rwa/en/) life expectancy at birth in 2006 was at 51 (m)/53 (f). Some basic health care coverage is certainly helpful but other factors might play a role: rural families might not have the means to even get close to doctors, the probability of death for children under 5 is extremely high (16%, same source) etc. 

I'm pretty sure (extreme) poverty is the major issue here. (e.g. look at the 8% who cannot afford coverage) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These replays would be ok from time to time but they are definitely overdoing them. It's not ESPN's fault, though: The whole world gets the same feed from FIFA. (I was watching on German television and noticed it, too.)

Today's England - USA game had a French director by the way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, for your analogy to work here you need to assume you can't stop the flow. But now you only refuted your own analogy. 

The point is that in the case of a problem of the magnitude of this oil spill, there is no way for any non-expert to stop it. Therefore it's quite desirable for the average Joe to "fight the symptoms", isn't it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nobody expects these solutions to stop the flow of oil. Still, any drop of oil you can extract from the sea now is a drop less on some bird's wings or on my beach towel - and a drop you won't have to clean up later.

To stay in your analogy: You might not fix the water pipe but until the plumber arrives you might be able to save a part of your furniture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sven is actually a pretty common name in Germany. Scandinavian first names in general are. His website suggests he is from southern Germany. (Northern Bavaria)

Also, yes, it is awesome. </TEXT>
