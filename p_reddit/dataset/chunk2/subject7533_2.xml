	<TEXT>  As the law stands every Saudi woman must have a male guardian, normally a father or husband, but in some cases a brother or even a son, who has the power to make a range of critical decisions on her behalf.

... a female surgeon in Saudi Arabia receiving an invitation to speak at a cardiac surgery conference in London, but having to get the permission of her son to do so. Her son declines to give her permission because he doesn't "feel like it".

WTF kind of archaic law is this? 

And despite this the [British government hasn't rule out re-electing Saudi Arabia to UN human rights council for the second time](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/saudi-arabia-human-rights-un-united-nations-uk-british-elected-behead-a7140501.html).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Another senior official has directly blamed the United States.

 The Obama administration has strongly denied any involvement or responsibility in recent events in the country. In a phone call to his counterpart in Turkey, US Secretary of State John Kerry said: Public insinuations or claims about any role by the United States in the failed coup attempt are utterly false and harmful to our bilateral relations."

None of these allegations by Erodogan's govt has any basis other than his so-called political "enemy" residing in the US. 

Erdogan is either playing a well thought out strategic game or he is simply lashing out in anger. From threatening the German parliament over the recent recognising the Armenian genocide to now insinuating that the Obama administration is directly involved in the recent attempted coup, he is rapidly losing allies. Erdogan is either a raving lunatic or simply a brilliant strategist.

But it's hard to credit him as the latter seeing that he reckons Mulism woman should have three children and alienated himself from those women voters. That hardly seems like a clever move for a politician. 

How critical is Incirlik Airbase to US and NATO operations or are there alternatives for USAF in neighbouring countries? It's risky to station US forces in a country and then to have to rely on a whims and fancies of a nutjob who can turn on sixpence. 

I dunno - please can some expert analyst weigh in on this guy?  </TEXT>

Some might even called it financial prudence - for example putting your regular savings into some legitimate funds in the Channel islands which might be tax free and then repatriating it back to the UK after you retired in order that you pay a lower income tax rate.

	<TEXT>  Gergely, an altar boy, would get pulled out of class and told to go to the church to help the monsignor.

 That was Father Francis McCaa, who was called a monster by a state grand jury in March. Its report concluded that he was among at least 50 priests in the local Altoona-Johnstown diocese who had systematically raped and molested hundreds of boys and girls for 40 years, while bishops covered it up and the criminal justice system looked the other way. McCaa died in 2007, at 82.

 Gergely killed himself earlier this month at 46.

50 frigging priests in the diocese were pedophiles! And the bishops covered for them.

 He also repeatedly referred to her as "the accused"

This is just frigging horrendous - and to rub salt into the wound, Wagner was acquitted by the judge but luckily Alberta's Court of Appeal overturned the ruling in 2015 and ordered a fresh trial. </TEXT>

 In addition, Salami accused Israel of serving as a proxy for American espionage in the Islamic world, stating that "the Palestinian revolution of stones is now turning into a revolution of missiles that will leave Israelis no time to breathe."

Gee... that's a pretty scary scenarios if it pans out. And I suppose he is assuming Isreal is just going to stand there waiting for them missiles to rain down on them.

	<TEXT> OP is probably referring to [this](http://www.newsweek.com/marijuana-and-old-amsterdam-308218)

 Cannabis with more than 15 percent of the THC that makes it intoxicating is now under consideration to be reclassified as one of the hard drugs that come with stiff penalties. The government has also forced coffee shops where marijuana is sold to choose between alcohol and pot, prompting many to choose the former. Amsterdam once played host to nearly 300 coffee shops, of more than 1,000 scattered across the country. There are now fewer than 200 in the city and only 617 nationwide. While its always been illegal to grow marijuana in the Netherlands, authorities passively allow coffee shops to sell weed, often pretending not to know where the shops cannabis comes from.

 But no longer. New laws target even the smallest of marijuana growers in Holland. In the past, people could grow up to five plants without fear of retribution. In 2011, the government issued new police guidelines and declared anyone who grew with electric lights, prepared soil, selected seeds or ventilation would be considered professional. Its a significant change, as professional growers risk major penalties, including eviction and blacklisting from the government-provided housing in which more than half of the countrys citizens reside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Cannabis Licensing Authority (CLA) chairman Hyacinth Lightbourne said the proposed dispensers would be essential in the therapeutic use of the drug.

 It would primarily be for people who have a prescription and, in effect, you're doing it for medicinal purposes with a permit from the Ministry of Health. If they don't have a prescription, then they can do what we call 'self-declare', and this will allow them to have the two ounces while they are here, Mr Lightbourne said.

In other words, you will have your two ounces during your stay here in Jamaica ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During the length of their stay

 The dispensers would be situated at airports and seaports, manned by a person with medical training. 

  That staff member would grant tourists who have a prescription for medical marijuana from abroad to purchase a permit to use or carry up to two ounces of marijuana whilst in the country.

	<TEXT> Another interesting controversy in the De Anza case concerning Judge Persky:

 Four of the baseball players invoked fifth amendment rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation.......

 The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could stay silent, but that would also mean that they would be prohibited from testifying in a later part of the case. 

 That ruling was, however, overturned by Persky, a move that Jane Does attorneys now say undermined her case.

 Persky, taking over the trail in 2011, allowed one of the defendants, Christopher Knopf, to enter evidence that the womans lawyers believed should have been covered by the earlier judges order.

 It was shocking to see judge Persky disregard that order, Burneikis said. One judge completely disregarding an order that another judge has entered: yes, that was unusual.

 It was devastating, she continued. I can remember how I felt the moment the ruling came down and it was like a nail in a coffin. I could not comprehend it.

	<TEXT> Not trying to discredit you. 

I am not an authority on such matters so I have to resort to a Google search and this WHO report is interesting especially this part: 

 The organ-exporting countries

 India was a commonly known organ-exporting country, where organs from local donors are regularly transplanted to foreigners through sale and purchase. Although the number of foreign recipients seems to have decreased after the enactment of a law banning the organ trade (the Human Organ Transplantation Act of 1994),10 the underground organ market is still existent and resurging in India. The Voluntary Health Association of India estimates that about 2000 Indians sell a kidney every year.11 The drop in foreign recipients in India was accompanied by an increase in the number of foreign recipients in other countries, such as Pakistan and the Philippines.

 In Pakistan, according to the Sindhi Institute of Urology, approximately 2000 renal transplants were performed in 2005, of which up to two-thirds were estimated to have been performed on foreigners.12 In the Philippines, data obtained from the Renal Disease Control Program of the Department of Health, National Kidney Transplant Institute, show that of the 468 kidney transplants in 2003, 110 were for patients from abroad. There is no comparable data for Egypt but a considerable number of patients from neighbouring countries are believed to undergo organ transplantation there.13

 In China, around 12 000 kidney and liver transplants were performed in 2005. Most of the transplant organs were alleged to have been procured from executed prisoners, a practice which itself is criticized by the international community.14,15 In the absence of paid organ donors, a question may be raised regarding whether the deceased organ transplants in China constitute an organ trade. Yet the lack of established rules about the allocation of organs, coupled with the prioritizing of foreigners due to their ability to pay and the existence of brokers, have been widely reported. These factors have led to the view that deceased organ transplants for foreigners in China do constitute part of the international organ trade. The number of foreign recipients in China is difficult to estimate, but a media report offers circumstantial evidence that over half of the 900 kidney and liver transplants performed in one major transplant centre in 2004 were for non-Chinese citizens from 19 countries.16

 The lack or insufficiency of a legal framework or enforcing mechanism in these countries has been highlighted by the public media and local experts. However, the Chinese and Pakistani governments recently have been taking steps to curtail the international organ trade (as of May 2007), which may change their respective situations.17,18

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/amazon-tribe-makes-first-contact-with-outside-world

In Peruvian rainforest: 

The contact took place across the border in Brazil and was recorded in a video released on Friday. The tribesmen caught a serious respiratory disease after contact, a major killer of isolated indigenous people, but have since recovered.


Also in Brazil: 

 The tribesmen come from one of over 75 uncontacted tribes believed to inhabit the vast Amazon rainforest, and their group is estimated to now number 40-50 people. They returned to the village some time after their first visit, suffering from a flu-like disease.

 A specialist medical team from the Brazilian governments indigenous peoples authority (Funai) treated the men, who have since returned to the forest.

 The doctor who treated the tribesmen warned of the possibility of more contacts in the region and emphasised the crucial need to train more specialised health teams to deal with first-contact and post-contact situations. Common diseases such as flu can cause fast and deadly epidemics in isolated tribes which have never encountered such infections before. .... 

We should leave them alone as much as possible.

	<TEXT> Well during the period prior to the Hong Kong handover Thatcher the ironlady met her match in Den Xiaoping:

 ["Deng Xiaoping entered the arena. He may not have held an official job title, but everyone in the world knew Deng ruled the Chinese roost. Abrasive, direct, chain-smoking and spitting into a porcelain spittoon, his two-hour meeting with Thatcher was testy, to say the least. There has been a lively debate, one British official was later reported as saying, about whether Dengs habit of spitting while receiving visitors is done for effect, or whether he really is a vulgar old bugger. ](http://www.timeout.com.hk/big-smog/features/41918/hong-kong-history-margaret-thatcher-1982.html)

Ops article:

 "The Iraqi authorities call on Turkey to ... immediately withdraw from Iraqi territory, the statement said.

 We have confirmation that Turkish forces, numbering about one armoured regiment with a number of tanks and artillery, entered Iraqi territory ... allegedly to train Iraqi groups, without a request or authorisation from Iraqi federal authorities, 

 The deployment is considered a serious violation of Iraqi sovereignty, it added.
