	<TEXT> Biased if you see my flair, but I really like **Runebound**, and if you follow my posts, I also promote **Clash of Cultures** for this quite a bit. As for games not in my own library, I think **Descent** and **Eldritch Horror** look like they'd do this quite well. Pretty much any game that is epic in size and scope works, and it helps if it's got some Ameritrashy theming to it. Oh, and obligatory **Pandemic Legacy** mention, and any other Legacy style game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Primary rule for a newcomer to the hobby, take your time learning what sorts of games you like or don't click with you and guide your purchases accordingly. Check out video reviews and play guides (Try Dice Tower and Rahdo Runs Through).

And also, search online for lists of Gateway Games they are the ones easiest to get into while you learn the hobby. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stopped using reddit to go to Allrecipes and check this claim out. The first review I read says this:  
i don't know how fair of a review i can really make of this recipe as i substituted chipotle powder (1/2 tsp) and bottled lemon juice (1/4 cup) for the recipe (that i halved).. although the spice was there, there was no pop.. i ended up squeezing the juice of one lime and shook a good amount of table salt over it.. i also added some chili powder.. i felt like it needed a lot more cilantro for that fresh taste.. since i did make substitutions i'm giving this a 3 instead of the 2 i think it's closer to

	<TEXT> **Elysium**. Fully expected to love that game, and by rights I'm sure a lot of people do, but it just didn't click like I'd hoped with either me or my partner. I love card combo sorts of games, but this one seemed flat. I think it was that so many of the cards across the various decks seemed identical or only slightly different, and the game feels very abstract. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Help me understand. When you say there are 6 listings for Dominion, you mean 6 copies of Dominion are being sold? Considering that's only 6 copies of a game, and 5 people selling copies of X wing, then we are looking at 11 games being sold which out of 1000+ listings is less than 1% and from that data we deduce the motive - that people want out of expansion heavy games? You could be right, but I'm not sure how these figures support that conclusion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a grand fantasy adventure, the likes of which I have not seen since Talisman. But, it fixes many of the flaws that Talisman has. There is an end-game goal, but how you choose to get there is completely up to you. But there is also a limited number of turns, which means the game won't drag on and on.
You can try to earn money to buy better equipment. Fight to gain experience and learn new skills. You can journey across the map in search of long lost treasure. There are different scenarios to play (although, only two in the base game) which create new events and encounters. Character development is rich and rewarding. You can play the same character in multiple games and have them progress differently each time. Combat is unique and refreshing with the token system. It is simple, but yet still offers plenty of strategy and doesn't feel as luck-dependent as rolling dice. quote from u/Grey-Ferret </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife recently exclaimed that **Seasons** is her absolute favorite board game - encouraging because she was very reluctant to join me in the hobby initially. You're correct in saying that the satisfaction in Seasons comes from the fact that it is a drafting game with more to it than just drafting. It is an engine building game with drafting at the center of the engine. Even after you draft cards, you spend 3 years (in game) drafting dice each turn. Some of the best artwork of any game I've ever played. The cards have insane detail, to the point that 30 games in I'll still squint at a card and realize, "Hey, that potion of resurrection, the bubbles in it are actually tiny skulls??" or something like that. </TEXT>

Others that are combat oriented like **Summoner Wars** or **Pixel Tactics** have military victories, others like **Runebound** or **Eldritch Horror** use event driven victories. These are all generally ameritrashy. I enjoy tons of games with VP, but agree when it's tied to theme it helps. **Seasons** refers to VPs as Prestige because you are gaining fame and notoriety as a wizard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool that they helped, but it does seem strange that what should be completely normal and expected customer service ends up being praised as if they went out of their way, when really it's just restoring what should have been in the initial purchase.  
And I've done the same thing myself, btw. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. This is exactly true. I was looking recently at a used copy of a game on BGG and almost pulled the trigger on it - but when I added in shipping I was actually paying the same price as a new copy delivered in 2 days with Amazon Prime.  
If the used sale price isn't significantly lower it just makes more sense to buy games new. That's another reason trading games away has been my main way of curating a collection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A question I have about math trades - is it a significant risk to trade **down** in value? Say I list a $20 game and a $50 game, and my want list includes a game that is $20 and another that's $45 - Might I end up trading my $50 game for the $20 game, taking a hit on trade value? Is there any protection against this? (sorry, first time math trading) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As Tom Vasel would say, if you like business and marketing, maybe consider starting a board game store as your market. If you like board games and think running a store sounds like fun, you should probably find something else to do. </TEXT>
