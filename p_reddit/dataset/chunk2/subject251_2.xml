	<TEXT> I would agree. The playability if this hand OOP is pretty shitty even thought think he can do this pretty light because of how strong it looks. It could honestly just be to ISO you in position vs the other limpets who are almost ALWAYS folding... The question tho, is if you ship what is his calling range? Do we think he's folding big hands? I think a jam looks incredibly strong on our part but who knows.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you plan to c/r a flop with 11 bb's behind...?

That is literally awful advice. We are WAY too short to be c/r flops.

The only play here is to shove pre or fold.  Shove  Fold  Flat.  Flatting is so horribly exploitable and allows villain to barrel almost every flop. If our hand does not flop well, we basically are giving away chips even though we can be ahead of a lot of his range.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, currently live in CT.  Usually have good stock of TH.  I just moved so am basically starting my collection from scratch, so sorry for the volume (or lack there of).  I focus mainly on fresh NE Hops but also enjoy a good sour or stout or maybe even a blonde depending on the day.

Going to try to keep this as my inventory list.  Will be open to trades - would prefer IP but would ship if you have a solid rep and the price point/ratios are fair.  Thanks!

	<TEXT> Played a super frustrating 1/2 PLO hand last night live.  Was sitting on around 450 or so, villain in hand is BB and has about 400.  


Had 10c8c9s6s and raised to $10 UTG+1 after a limp.  2 calls, and villain raises to $40.  BB UTG calls, I call, button calls.


Flop 9c7s4c and BB fires $50.  Things get fucked up here - I did not see that UTG had cards and I announce $240 before he acts.... He ends up folding, my $240 goes in, BB is all in for like $50 (whatever) and BB tanks and says I gotta be ahead and ships the rest in and I call.  Villain shows AhAd9d2d.... huh?


Board runs out 3x3x and he scoops.  He racks up 1 hands later and says I knew I was ahead. 
EDIT: Just ran equities, 81% in this hand ughhhhhhhh </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hand 1: You are short at this table, with less than 50 BB this hand plays much differently.  Check back the turn and plan to call most rivers.


Hand 2: 4x is NOT huge in a live NL game.  5-10x is commonly used - depends on the table dynamics.  AP the fold is fine.


Hand 3: No need to squeeze to $40 with TT oop.  Its fine to check w that hand imo, some people will tell you otherwise.  Flop is an easy c/r as it is such a wet board.  If they flopped a straight then whatever its a cooler.   No one has TT or QQ as it was a limed pot.  You get value from all Kx, all xxhh, and all 2 pair combos.  Make it $75 or so on the flop.  </TEXT>

I expect him to almost never have AA here. Probably going broke on this hand but wouldn't be surprised to see 88.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guess I'll go t keep this rolling.
Used to play in a 2/5 NL club game in college.  Some nights they would spread a 5/5 Uncapped - but it was usually scheduled like a week or 2 out.

Place had 2 off shift cops who worked the door, with their service pistols and wore them on their hip during the game hours.  The game was really actually pretty well run.  They offered cool perks - free drinks, free smokes, food runs, a lounge w an xbox/PS, pool table, some arcade games, and sometimes there were some methy looking hookers roaming around in there.  

I parked about a quarter of a block from the place one night and walked in to play the scheduled 5/5 game that night.  I brought 5k, was planning on 1.5k/1.5k/2k bullets (or top offs if it was playing deeper).  I ran pretty well and played pretty well and ran a stack up to 10k or so.  Game was slowing down, I had class, etc and decided to rack up.  Was given all the cash, checked outside the doors and cops let me walk to my car.  Someone sneaks up on me, or popped out of an alley, idk, but takes me in a headlock w one arm and pressed what I can only assume to be a gun in my back.  He says confidently "I know where you have been, just give me what you have in your pockets and we wont have any trouble"

I froze up a little and eventually forked over all the cash.  He took my cell phone an broke it in half so I couldn't call the cops (probably would not have anyway after playing in an illegal club game? idk).  Of course the club claims they had no knowledge of what happened, were not a part of it, and didn't think it was fishy.  Never went back there again now that im typing this im kinda getting pissed about it lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think calling it down is perfectly fine.  Pre should be a little bigger from you - I like to make this like .90 
After he raises flop, I don't mind the flat.  Turn is safe enough that you can call down.  I expect him to have KQ w some frequency and AQ sometimes.  This could even be combo hands like JTss.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the 6 is irrelevant with that 3 card wrap flop.  Could be anything, but yea 345x is possible with back doors I guess. I still feel if he had this he would bet/call and not bet/raise.  Bet call then c/r turn is much stronger play imo, especially if he turns a FD </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The weird part about his line is the flop is so dry... rainbow flop and only straight draws are wheel wraps.
The fact that he has 3b here is strange to me.  I fee like 22xx and wheel wraps are flatting most of the time.  Bad aces is certainly possible as he is in SB and does not need to inflate the pot and play against 4 villains OOP. 
Seems kind of nitty, but the more I think about it I just give them credit unless you have them noted as a maniac.  Vs a solid reg I think its a fold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always wondered whats optimal in these situations.
Hero sits w 200 BB and has two red Aces.  Raises to 8bb pre (this is a live cash game...) from UTG+1 and 5 people flat.  3 of them cover, one is short one has about 100bb.  

Flop is AT4 all spades... Whats our sizing?  Surely it depends on our table dynamic.  Whats our action if its LAGGY, as opposed to loose passive, and opposed to tight passive?

I have wondered if its optimal to bomb these flops, make smallish cbets for pot control if a spade hits the turn and we want to draw to fill up.  Interested what r/poker has to say about this situation </TEXT>
