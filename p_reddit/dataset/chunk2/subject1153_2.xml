	<TEXT> My point here is simple. You have studied the Enlightenment? Good: You know what I mean when I say we are headed into the Endarkenment. The lights upon us are dimming. We have been more or less abandoned by a press that proves incapable of informing us in anything approaching a disinterested fashion. As suggested, either the media are Clintonian liberals before they are newspapers and broadcasters, or they are servants of power before they serve us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the leadership of these Shadow Govt agencies share similar political agendas which lead us down the path to an authoritarian world government. Comey of the FBI and Brennan of *Catholics In Action* come to mind. 

Trump is going up against widespread systemic criminality in government. That's not something he can do just because he's President. He needs a lot of help.

	<TEXT> TEPCO tries to be optimistic, but they really have no idea where the corium is exactly. They don't have good handle on the situation which has been an ongoing unmitigated environmental catastrophe from day one. You asked about the rate  of contamination earlier. Well its roughly 300 tons of radioactive waste water going into the Pacific every day for the last 6 years. We can assume it will be 300 tons per day for at least the next 250 years. This is a huge concern because the "experts" are mistakenly equating radiation from spent nuclear fuel with banana heat, and they're telling everyone that these are safe levels and that the seafood is safe.

	<TEXT> The coriums are no longer in containment. They're  deep underground somewhere, contaminating the ground water. That's why they were trying to  collect all of it in massive tank farms up until they decided to "treat" it and dump it directly into the ocean because they were running out of space to store it. Its definitely not a leak. Its an unmitigated disaster on so many levels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The potential harm of live-streaming suicide is very real, said Phyllis Alongi, clinical director at the Society for Prevention of Teen Suicide in New Jersey. It increases the chances of what experts call suicide contagion, which is also common after celebrities kill themselves.

Suicide contagion sounds really lame. It sounds like something we should try to prevent if at all possible. I mean, imagine if this thing really catches on like wildfire. That's a lot of dead people and many more who will be traumatized by watching them die.

We make it better by talking about it in an public, completely uncensored fashion.

In case you missed it, this is the biggest story out there, really. [Getting the truth out.](https://youtu.be/ov5kvWSz5LM) That's what journalism is all about. It all boils down to DISSEMINATING THE TRUTH. That's what REAL journalists do.

You know, for a /u/LearnedEnglishDog , you don't seem like the sharpest tool in the shed ;)

	<TEXT> Either Trump and friends have engaged in treasonous acts or Americas intelligence officials are guilty of a colossal lapse in judgment  or worse, a conspiracy against Trump. Either way  whether any of these allegations are true or false  the entire matter must be investigated thoroughly and immediately. 
The dark clouds hovering over American politics must be cleared up. Left unresolved, the allegations present a clear and present danger, a ticking time bomb that could explode and bring an end to Americas nearly 250-year experiment in self-government.

	<TEXT> proof Black Lives Matter is bad, even though the only thing possibly connecting it to BLM 

The proof is in the pudding. BLM has been exposed as a govt-sponsored hateful ideology, not a group. There are no declared members of this "group" known as BLM. The BLM message of hate simply spreads like a virus much like "radical Islam" does. There are no official "members" of "radical Islam." They all just think they're doing God's work. In truth, these "radical Muslims" share a common, hateful ideoleology with many backwards thinking degenerates just like the BLM'ers do.
