	<TEXT> Do you know for sure she was raped? What evidence do we have other than her report through the media who jumped on this case.  
I would love to visit al quds, I guess some would class this as being under Israel, but are you not aware of the human rights violations of the Israeli government? It's a total joke as to what attrocities they get away with! Try visiting Oman, it's an awesome place. Although Dubai is safe and flashy, it's not my cup of tea (even though I currently live here). Oman on the other hand, it's like the whole country just took a massive chill pill, such friendly people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of... it does cover capital punishment for rape, but the requirement for such a sentence is to have 4 witnesses! However, in lieu of witnesses, a lesser punishment can be given. I.e capital punishment is top end of scale but has to be absolutely no doubt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Yeah, for capital punishment. but that's not a pre-requisite for ANY trial or punishment. 
  
  
 It is for rape too, which is the subject of this article.

I meant that the requirement for 4 witnesses was only to request the capital punishment but the the 4 weren't required for a lesser sentence ("ANY trial or punishment") of rape. One could still be punished without the witnesses, just not to the extent of capital punishment.  
I take your point about the clubbing environments though (a side of Dubai I don't really see myself :p )  
I spent about 6 months working in Tokyo, and I was thinking of that when I typed my message as yeah, I totally agree, and I would move there in a heartbeat if my Japanese was anywhere near my Arabic! However, no matter how safe it felt, there seemed to have a certain subtle underlying sinister feel to certain places. It's hard to describe, or put my finger on. Maybe I read too much about the Yakuza, haha or been watching too many Japanese movies! ;)  
I think the difference between the two places if that the Japanese are so unbelievably conscientious, dedicated an honourable. That last term "honour" can turn violent, and when coupled with determination, can get ugly. Whereas Arabs (of the Gulf) pretty much can't be arsed to do anything, let alone get up to be violent. It's more a safety out of apathy in Dubai :p </TEXT>

It's probably one of the only (if not THE only) major city in the world where a woman can walk around and be safe, in any part of the city, at any time of night, wearing anything. Off the top of my head I cannot think of any other city (at least one I've experienced) where women could feel any more safe. 
  
 the law requires 3-4 adult male witnesses

Anecdotes aren't exactly representative of a nation. Nor do we even know the details of the case. If she was raped, then that is terrible, and the rapists should be punished severely (and under Islamic law it can be very severe). However, it wouldn't be the first time that someone has called "rape" when in fact it never happened.

	<TEXT> Nice reply.  
However, on the last point, what Muslims are taught, and what they practice are totally different. Just look at the way they drive putting the lives of others at risk, the way they litter and ruin the environment, the way they inconsiderately push in line. I am a revert, I see all this first hand around the world. Try going on Hajj, you'll see the best and a lot more of the worst of people's behaviour.  
I have had some very very pleasant interactions and received some great hospitality from Arabs, however, never from an Emirati. The perception is that they they act holier than thou, and look down on others. I would love to be shown another side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah don't get me wrong. I am also for defamation laws. It was just the proportion of the punishments that some might see as skewed. If parking in a handicapped space isn't a big issue (i.e. low fine) then why is it a massive issue if it's shared? I agree that it's definitely an issue, but 150 times worse? If the act of sharing was so bad as to have caused serious distress to the original guy, then this is rather telling of public perception of the gravity of the initial contravention, when in fact wasn't that big a deal. </TEXT>

1) Brits don't talk to strangers  
2) If we did start a conversation and it transpired that you didn't speak English, that would be awkward  
3) Emiratis aren't exactly friendly to strangers (generalising here)  
4) We would be scared of offending religious sensitivities.  
As a muslim I have learned am aware of the religious sensitivities, so for me the last one isn't an issue, but the rest still stand true. It's a shame as I would love to befriend some locals. </TEXT>

They will if it affects ratings, thus how much their ad slots are worth. Local or national ads... any combination of PIP or full screen and time shifts can be used. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in broadcasting, and there is totally no reason they need to cut out the race. One of the products that we design will allow you to play out a show, and stretch/squash the time plane (by roughly 20%) with phase shifting so the audio sounds correct. This allows broadcasters to slip in ads and still keep the format. Yes, it'll be SLIGHTLY non live, but is that such an issue? If it is, then why not use our *holds up product B* which allows you to put a PIP and have the advert there? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The helmet has a [polystyrene lining](http://www.technocrazed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Discover-Amazing-Cross-section-View-Of-22-Everyday-Objects-Cut-In-Half-13.jpg). It absorbs the impact but compresses the polystyrene. If you were to have a second impact, the polystyrene would have already been compressed, so won't absorb the second shock.  
If a helmet is dropped, the outer shell would likely pop back to it's original shape, but you can't tell what's happened inside. </TEXT>

They wanted to make a point so called the local supermarket and asked "can I speak to the VP of carrots" in a sarcastic voice, giving me a smug look...
