	<TEXT> That's a little too cruel IMO. That's like...more than how much a final should be worth in high school. Also, what if they show up   still do poorly? 40% is super unreasonable  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think to myself "Can i make it through the day without breaking down? Can i stay busy enough   Distracted enough?" If i'm unsure or  the answer is no, i take the day. So far I've been able to get through without taking a day, but who knows what life   stress will bring in the future! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! I'm a high school math teacher who is very enthused with the cannabis industry as well. I have not experienced drug testing. As for students: Stick to the 'say no to drugs' policy. Dont talk about it with them in an approving tone. If they bring up cannabis, bring up the repercussions  (i usually talk about the legal issues, because morally I cant tell them that cannabis is bad). Dont talk to staff members about your cannabis.... enthusiasm. Its none of their business   it keeps you safe.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hi! USA here, I got my degree in Illinois. I majored in Secondary Education (grades 6-12) and Mathematics. You have to double major (sort of) for secondary ed. I took the same courses as math majors did, and also a bunch of education philosophy courses. We were required to do 120 hours of observation in different schools during our 4 years, and at the end of our 4 years we do student teaching. We pick a school, get mentored by a teacher and teach courses by ourselves for 10-12 weeks before graduation. Honestly, the most i've learned about teaching was in those 10-12 weeks of teaching vs the  4 years of college classes!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember that teaching isnt a competition. Teaching is experience and growth. You cannot possibly be as great as an experienced teacher, thats just not realistic. What helped me get over it is doing the best that I could do and being proud of my little accomplishments. One day you (and I!) will be as legendary as the experienced teachers :) But for now, let's just be our best and be proud of it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a firm believer that if you're meant to teach you will, and if you doubt it- dont do it. If you want, finish your degree and get a masters in something else that you're passionate about. Kids need teachers that want to teach. If you think you might not like it, dont waste your time or theirs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All that is wonderful stuff that I already do! Thank you :)  
HOWEVER, I 100% know that the teacher is keeping them and making them work on their papers. This issue isn't about students trying to miss class and loophole out of thing. This is about a teacher abusing her power and making the kids stay and miss a class because she believes hers is more important.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I lucked out on my job. My colleagues are (mostly) awesome and supportive, the kids are pretty great too! I can't think of anything I want to do more than go teach every day. Although, i can't wait for the summer:) 
This job isnt for everyone. I'm glad you decided to leave because there's nothing worse for you and your students than trying to teach when you hate your job. Cant tell you how many bad teachers exist that do this day in and day out. makes me sad for them and their students </TEXT>
