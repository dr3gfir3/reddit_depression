	<TEXT> Be nice  to people. Try to date girls.  
These two are the things I just don't do.  
I have never had a girlfriend who cared about me. Few were interested for  superficial reasons(my face) but no one  emotionally attached to me. I have had 3-4 severe crushes  and they  all broke my heart before we even became  friends. I mean they just  refused to understand me and talk to me as if I am some dirty thing  that shouldn't  be around them. Fuck them man!  
I also try not to  be as nice to people as I was. They seem to think being nice means weak. They try to take advantage of you if you're too nice.  
I am quite apathetic now and I don't give a fuck about  anyone including myself. Now I just want a job that can make sure I survive. I don't want to live(not suicidal) and I just do not want to enjoy my life. It will be taken away and that fear stops me from loving life again. I just don't  want to do anything. Just...don't want to  exits. Just...survive for another 40-50  years. I am 19 if that matters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is I don't have time for all this. My family is struggling and my parents are simply stupid(hurts to admit). My dad has always  been a person who did not want to take responsibility.  
Basically, we are struggling a bit financially and I am in a conflict whether to study or find a job. It has hampered my life and I am unable to concentrate on studies and don't  know how to find a job. Along with this apathy/crisis I have a burden of finding a way to be  skillful and/or find any job. It just sucks. So many conflicts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Psychology. I really wanted to be a psychologist  but my financial conditions have always been shitty throughout my life and psychology requires lots of schooling otherwise there are not  a lot of options in it and I just can't handle the classroom environment. I  was never regular  in school either. I prefer getting books, studying by myself and just go  to give exams. It is  possible  to do that in my country but  my parents  refuse to do that. Anyway, that's a different topic.   
Basically, I wanted  to  be a psychologist  but now I am considering a  change of  plan. I'd be okay with a short term accounting certificate  and get an okay paying  job. I'd  be  fine with less money, less human interaction and lots  of free time as I  don't enjoy doing  anything really. I  am  running away  from life  and do  not want to experience  anything new now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am having this existential crises for a long time now. From about 1.5 years since I have started college I have  been asking myself what do I want  to do with my life? I don't know myself very well. I do not know much about my likes/dislikes, strengths/weaknesses, specific goals etc. I have low confidence and I just keep thinking  about "doing something". I don't know  what  but I know I will need a career at some point and a  direction in my life. I am  so lost. I have no idea what to do with my life. I  was just going through school without enjoying it and  in the process I  simply forgot that I need to relax a little as well. I have so many questions but no answers. I see my friends setting goals, get  the girls, have fun in life etc and here I am, full of insecurities and no goals etc. Even  today I skipped a college class as  I  am not  sure if I even want to pursue this degree. I guess the end is near for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have played video games, watched movies, used internet in my free time and played outside with friends a lot less during my childhood and teen  years(19 now). Believe me, getting back to the real world from the virtual world has been so difficult so  far because I had gotten used to be at my computer all day for so many years.  
When I started going outside again, it was HELL. I  was so out of touch  with reality  and for one  year I was in  a dream  like state. It  caused me anxiety and possibly depression because the days were overwhelming as I was out for whole day.  
I wish  I  had done extra curricular activities and did something productive. Also, playing outside  would have  increased my contacts and I wouldn't be so out of touch. Believe me, playing video games etc doesn't do any good and it just wastes your time if you cannot find the balance. However, all was not my fault. My father discouraged me from going out but that's a whole another story.  
Bottom line is, you did the right  thing by being productive back  in the day.  
P.S I  should maybe start learning coding if I just wants to sit  in  front of a screen. Maybe  that'd be a good idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being a good writer is more about marketing your book well.  
It's such a subjective field  that  there are no set rules. I have seen novices getting heavily criticized not just because of their mistakes  but also because there is this  mindset that "hey, he's just  starting  out, he can't be that good. Let me  find out the loopholes in his plot/grammar etc.  and make sure he puts a better version  next  time."   
I  am  not saying novices are perfect, it's just  that  any  art field is more about building connections and be appealing to the audience.  Knowledge and information  are the basic foundation of your book  but most  of  the work is just marketing yourself  well and hope to  get lucky.   
Probably, this is  why artistic fields are toughest to  get into. </TEXT>

So, I am glad I won't have any debt when I graduate as I am attending a state  university which is  hard to get into. I feel sorry for students of USA who graduate with debt. That's a  lot of pressure. Even being in an inexpensive school stresses me time to time as job searching would be hard.  
Although I am sure I will have a roof over my  head, 3 meals everyday, clothes to wear, computer,wifi etc for a long time so I shouldn't worry but hey, the pressure to do something with my life is always there.

I  want  to drop out and find an alternate path  to  get  the degree. I  can  opt for school  of  open learning and I think that will suit  me. But my brother has dropped out  3 times already and never held  a job plus he  spends a lot  of money so  my family is reluctant to let  me  drop out.  
It sucks man!  My family expects way  too much as well and I don't like it. All my life I have felt I have been running away from  stuff and  I am too afraid to live.  
My dad is lazy  and  has  always ran  away  from  responsibilities and I am just  tired of this existence now.  
Sorry, I started rambling. My point is it sucks  for most of  us and we are in this together.  Sheesh! sometimes I  feel like we  should all live  together like roommates and make sure  the  burden is  reduced on each individual lol.

	<TEXT> Look, I  am not from  USA  so I can't give  you technical  details but  I think  one thing to achieve  anything  in  life  is  pure  determination. When I  was a  senior in high school, it  was  like I was  possessed by  a higher power. I was too determined to  achieve my  goal  even  though  people around me never believed  in me  and  rightly  so   because I  never  gave a reason to believe  in me prior to that year.   
However, I REALLY wanted to  end my school career  on a high so I just  REALLY wanted  it badly.  
What I did was, turned off social media  completely for about 3  months prior to my final  exams and  studied my ass off.  
There is no shortcut in any field mate. You  want better  grades?  Simple. Study smart  and work hard.  
Unfortunately, I have  lost  that  motivation  I had  back  in school after  I achieved my goal and  hence, I   haven't  done  much since then but  at least it gave me the confidence that hard work  can  beat talent  and  pure determination makes everything possible.  
As far as college is  concerned, I'd say  choose a major you're passionate about. Also, if you're  going to take student loans then you will  have to be careful about  the major you choose. Based on my reading  on the internet, community college  seems like a good idea as it saves you from debt. You can always transfer   later anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I  am only 19  but I regret being painfully shy as a kid and having  low self esteem  in my  teenage years. Looking  back, girls really liked me because I really was good  looking with  thick hair.  I, for some  reason, was inclined to  perceive  myself  as a "loser".  I would even search things like  "Why  am I a loser"  on Google lol.
Also, I allowed  my family to convince me that  there was something wrong with me.  Turns out  they are probably insecure and depressed themselves and  there  are not many things wrong about me.  In  fact,  I  am a pretty good  thinker and wise for my age  as well.   
I regret not having normal  experiences because of my shyness  but I have done a lot of  things  as well so  it's okay. I am still young  and kinda proud of  myself  because I  have done  quite  a  few things. </TEXT>

Now I am in college and I  can  say  school doesn't matter much in the  grand  scheme of  things. Every  day  is  a new challenge. </TEXT>

I guess as long as your work and/or studies are not being effected then it's okay. However, if you choose social media over work/study then that is a problem.  
Apart from that, it is okay to be on internet if you have nothing else to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That I have been one of the toppers in last year of high school despite having an alcoholic and abusive unemployed father which made me suicidal every day and gave me anxiety attacks which still makes it hard for me to go out.  
I had to score more than 90% to get my name on the toppers board while having a terrible home life, teachers putting me down and saying I might fail in few subjects, getting shit from them for being irregular in school, getting shit from my brother who thought I was not good enough to achieve this goal and working hard on my subjects but getting overshadowed in few subjects from a close friend because of his good image among the teachers.  
Really, no one believed in me including my family and friends. Naturally, I also, at times, thought I'll never be able to get it but I worked extremely hard. I even burned out after that year but I did it.  
Pressure was real because two years prior my own awesome brother had scored 92+% and the year before my close cousin had got 95%.  I didn't want to be the odd one out and I really wanted to prove my doubters wrong so I worked hard but got shit from the people around me during the entire year.  
It was a terrible phase because it was already hard to work while going through the abuse then it became even harder when no one believed in me and didn't encourage me.  
I can proudly say I was one of the topper but I am even prouder considering the circumstances I was in. It was more than just being the topper. It was the moment that for the first time in my life I had felt if I work hard then I can achieve my dreams. I felt nothing was impossible. I felt I had control of my life and I, for the first time, had realized I can choose to alter my actions if I want a different result.  
For some, it's a normal thing to top but for a guy like me who had never even scored 70% during my entire life, it was a great moment when I had scored 90%+ during the last year of my school.  
My friend from whom I was getting overshadowed got 82-point-something and I 90.75.  
Few friends were shocked that I did that well and few were shocked that I  did better than my friend.  
It was like I grew up immensely after that year.  
That friend is still my friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My father suffers from depression and anxiety and I am pretty sure he has schizophrenia or something like that as well(I am  studying psychology in college).  
Trouble is I feel I am a bipolar and has social anxiety but my parents won't believe it. According to them, it can't happen to someone as young as me(lol). They do not take me  seriously and needless to  say, my father sort of doesn't exist because he is an emotional burden to me and refuses to talk or  teach me anything.  
I realize psychological disorders can  ruin  a person's life so it's understandable why he is so incapable but the trouble is I  am sort of like him as well and I feel I won't reach anywhere in life because I am too anxious for  everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was 13, I had my first love. I became so brave that I was ready to  fight the world. I did things for her openly. I even gave her love letters in front of everyone in the class when teacher was not there. Any girl would at least appreciate the effort but she was quite arrogant because she was very smart and maybe she thought I was not good enough to be her friend let alone boyfriend. So, what happens is I do things for her, everyone realizes I am in love with her but she just refuses to even talk to me. Not her fault though, I was a weird kid and she was highly intelligent. Becoming friends with me would have hurt her reputation despite me being actually decent looking.  
Finally I decided to give her a birthday present and she refused to even take that. Although it was just a pen but I had already spent money on it and I had bought it for her so I wanted to give it to her. I tell one of our mutual friend to give it to her and he does that. She takes it but later as soon as she gets in the van to go home, she threw that gift out of the window. Ouch! That really hurt me. I was still in  love though. I tried talking to her next day and she refused to talk again. 
 At this point, even her friends are tired of all the drama and they tell her that she is being really rude and she should at least talk to me but she still refuses to talk. As few days goes on and this drama continues she finally gets too tired and  threaten to rat me out and get the teacher involved.  
I don't take  her seriously and ....it happens. She tells the teacher. I go and meet her and she lectures me about how I am being a creep and I should stop this inappropriate behavior. So, I felt defeated. I grew hatred towards her now. All this love vanished in a moment. I felt awful. From next day, I stopped trying to talk  to her but the urge was still there. But I was defeated. I could have had a time of my life but instead I was left embarrassed. My peers repeatedly made fun of me everyday for the rest of the year and I was just waiting for the year to be over.  
I never gained the confidence to ask a girl out since that incident and to this day, I have low self esteem and I do not talk to girls very openly. I am very reserved and a bit anxious too but that has happened because of plenty of horrible things.  
I felt awful and way too embarrassed that year. My most embarrassing year ever.  
However, I wouldn't blame her. She was super smart and beautiful and deserved better than me. I was a weird, over sensitive kid who used to cry on little things (hate to admit this) and an average in academics. Looking back, I really did not deserve to be her boyfriend but maybe friendship was not such a big deal. Also, acting like a creep did not help my case but I can't blame myself for that. I had felt I was in love for the first time ever.....and it ended so horribly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But my experience says, arranged marriages last long because the couple are too dumb to go separate ways. They were never confident enough to get a date  by themselves and choose their partners for themselves. So, even if their marriage is failing they won't divorce each other. I have seen PLENTY of unhappy couples in India and in many cases women suffer from domestic violence and they don't utter a single word against it. Plenty of them are too weak to leave the man no matter how bad the situation gets. Also, men have to make sacrifices as well but you get my point about the divorce rate. </TEXT>

I'd like to take my studies more seriously. Find some new friends. In 2015, I had hit rock bottom and I was completely hopeless and had lost the will to live. I am better this year but still pretty indifferent to anything. I see other people happy, having friends, in relationships, just having a great time etc. and here I am finding it hard to enjoy anything. Sometimes I look at other people and feel "Wish I was you".  
I'd like to see how it pans out and I want to improve myself. My goal at 19 is to find true happiness, great people, great experiences and financial independence. I am already a minimalist and I am careful with money. I am confident that things can get better but there is not one particular thing I am looking forward to. </TEXT>

I still see him every other morning three days a week because we are doing another course together in an institute. It will end in February. I have started to feel that will be the end of our friendship as well. Not that I don't like him. We are like minded and pretty comfortable with each other but I am not sure if I can trust him anymore and there's just a feeling somewhere in my heart that this friendship has reached its end a long time ago and I have been dragging it along for a while. </TEXT>

Way beyond anyone's dreams.
Look out for me and see above,
For you'll only find me when you look up.

I have got to go and see the galaxy.
Broken the shackles, no more mundane activities.
New adventure is out there, waiting for me.
So I'll go now and fetch myself a sublime dream.

A shimmering shoreline is ahead of me.
Gentle tides wavers my worries.
Voice of an angel sounds so soothing.
Watching beauty of the nature is amusing.

Sunset gives me a new hope.
I am assured there'll be a new day coming for sure.
I want to meet my future self soon.
Till then, reverie will make me stay on the moon. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-10 17:27:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a problem with college.  I am in my third semester and I live in an Asian country(I know Americans might not be the best to help because you are not aware of my societal and cultural settings but still any advice is appreciated because no one around me understands my situation).  So, here's the story: I am currently pursuing a BA(Honors) in Applied Psychology. Here, BA is a 3-year course. I am in one of the most reputed universities in  my country and I was one of the topper in high school so I had to work pretty hard to get here because the admissions are given on merit base and the cut-off is very high due to so much competition. So, I worked hard and got here.  
But the thing is, I have been wanting to drop out from this college. I  have lived a sheltered life as a kid and  I grew up in an abusive environment (my  father was an  alcoholic  and used to beat us up  when drunk). Long story short, I failed to make a transition from high school to college because I have never had any good  experiences and I have developed anxiety and depression to some extent(not diagnosed yet). So, I skipped a lot  of classes during my semester 1 but my real problems started in semester 2. I didn't go a single day for an entire semester and went straight to practicals examination and my teachers(3-4 of  them) yelled the hell out and gave me another mental  trauma. Then I became even more scared and when third semester started, I became extremely hopeless, I started dreading going to the lab and it didn't help that I missed two straight weeks initially so my professors have been throwing taunts at me since third semester and now I have a very low self esteem and my professors thinks I am an unreliable pathetic loser who doesn't deserve to be in this course anymore.  I  feel so trapped now. I am trapped in my mind. My parents have told me to  not even think  about dropping out but I can't take their(professors) insults anymore. My mother has suggested that she can come and talk to them but I am 19 and since I have been 14-15 I have been sort of alone in my battles  because my father was such a reckless and careless person and my brother used to make fun of me in everything. So, it  feels weird  that I am  officially an adult now and would need my mum to talk to my professors. I  would like to handle it all by myself. I am just so unmotivated to finish  the degree. I want to change my path and change my major but...I am in a huge dilemma because dropping out is never an option for my parents. I need some advice.  Also, a great point to be noted is I am in no debt and university fees is pretty low so I am not in a huge financial trouble or accumulated any debt.  
TL;DR: I feel like I am in depression. I can't tolerate college anymore. My parents won't allow me to drop out. I feel trapped. I sometimes think about suicide too. Need some advice. </TEXT>

I don't owe you anything. Why don't you just ignore it if it bothers you? What I have said is true and I am not going to explain any further. Who are you to judge the entire world? Have you seen every inch of the planet? How do you know what's happening in other countries? There are 197 countries in the world and 8 billion people. So you're saying you know everything about the world and its people? Stop being a butthurt dude. I am not seeking attention. If I wanted it I would have posted this on a megathread, not here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was laughing when I read your explanations simply because of the fact that you assumed I belong to a school in USA. A big fat LOL for that. I live in Asia(won't tell you the country) and things are different here, very, very different. I might have mental illness too. I don't know but I assure you I haven't made anything up. I think they allowed me to write the exam because they took mercy on me? I don't know. I seriously don't know why they allowed me. I thought I would get expelled right then and there but I didn't. That's why I stated again and again that "miraculously" I passed everything. Also, if you go by the brand value then it's the best university to be at in the entire country, but only reputation wise, infrastructure is terrible. 
Again, I am not an American and you probably haven't even visited my country ever. </TEXT>

You know your answer. Answer is find something that you like to do and you would enjoy. The thing that you have to do now is explore. Take online classes. Read stuff on the internet. Go on Khan's academy. Learn coding. Watch tutorials. If you haven't found what you like then you have to try as many things as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It happened to me since childhood but I really first failed in science and maths in 9th standard. I was addicted to internet and didn't put effort in study. Once I failed, I started thinking I am not good enough. Once I lost confidence, I lost everything.  I never believed I could get the grades if I put in some effort but I had hit the rock bottom when I failed the subjects. Still not recovered. Still have low confidence. Still have self esteem issues.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Semester 2. I literally attended only 3 days during the entire semester. My subject includes practical/lab work as well and yet I remained  an absentee for so long.
Looking back, I realize I had terrible  anxiety  and I can't believe I was in such a dark place and yet I didn't kill myself. 
I used to dread before leaving for college and my throat would dry up completely and I had irrational and intense fears like my professor is going to yell at me, I will do some stupid stuff etc. I don't know, those were just irrational. 
Fast  forward and we had the practical exam coming up. I hadn't done any lab work and I was SCARED. I was really SCARED. I was actually HORRIFIED thinking about going for the exam.  I did it anyway because my mom said me to go and my parents were just against dropping out. They would let me face the humiliation but wouldn't let me drop out. So, I go there. Commuting 1.5 hours and scared as hell. As it turns out, I put on a brave face, I  go in there and straight away I get smashed all over the place. Not a physical assault but 3-4 professors started yelling at me together. I was HORRIFIED. They kept shouting and shouting and told me to call my parents. I had to tell them the truth. I told them I live quite far away and my father has mental illnesses. He was an alcoholic too and I had the one of the most traumatic childhood ever on the planet. I told them I was burnt out. I was psychologically burdened and emotionally traumatized. I had given up on life when I turned 18 and I was full of apathy. I usually put on a somewhat normal  face when I am out so they just told me I should have told them earlier. Anyway, they refused to let me take the exam but miraculously one professor  showed some mercy and allowed me to sit in the lab and write the exam. I just didn't know how to do it so all I did was some random bullshit. I wrote complete nonsense but I did it. 
I was sure I was going to fail the entire semester but again, miraculously, I got my results and I saw I have passed everything. 
Due to new grading system, they don't put lab/practical grades on our transcript but due to the fact I hadn't attended any classes all semester they thought I was going to flunk even the theory exams. I even got a B grade in stats exam and I hadn't even given internals. Internal assessment was of 25 marks and the theory exam was of 75 marks. I passed everything and here I am, in my third semester, knowing fully well I have successfully cleared one year of college and few of my regular coming classmates have to re appear in few exams. I, miraculously, dodged the bullet and cleared everything.  I want to make it clear I am still not fully well and I am still full of apathy but it's better this year. I am actually giving a fuck about doing the work a bit this semester.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can totally relate. However, I know it's not good to keep feeding this habit and routine. World demands hard work and motivation if you  want to achieve something big so I think I'll have to get out of it sooner than later....but, it's so comfortable to be sad. It's like a warm blanket that is protecting me and keeping me warm...it's just so...nice...and comforting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. I never tried making friends deliberately in high school and just allowed it to happen naturally but in hindsight, that was not completely right way to approach this. Now  I am at college.
When you're in college, sometimes, you have to make things happen rather than just sit around and wait. All OP did was ask her out for a coffee. He's just saying Hi to people. How else is he going to introduce himself? You have to start somewhere I guess and someone has to initiate it. At most, the girl should have politely or indirectly told him that she has a boyfriend and make it clear that she'd be only friends with him, nothing else. Or she could have just played it cool and talk. Calling her boyfriend over this was an overreaction. It's not like he wants to sleep with her anyway.
