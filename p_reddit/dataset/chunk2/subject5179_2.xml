	<TITLE> Why Supremacy to Spanish? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-08 06:04:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Always wondered why the game had Spanish villagers as the strongest. Thought Spanish people are quite lazy by rule...

Why not give Supremacy to the Saracens maybe? Or to an African Kingdom now that they are in the game... 

Thoughts? Do they really have a history behind this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Guys,

How far do you wall when you play defensive or even mix-strategy games? Options below, add yours.
[Map - Arabia]

1) Initially make a compact wall with palisade and later in the game add stone walls ahead of it.

2) Wait for late Feudal and start stone walling, don't make any palisade walls.

3) Wall half the map [based on mini map learning] right away as you hit Feudal age. Few expert players play this game at times.

4) Only make short box/triangle walls throughout the game protecting villagers and resources.  </TEXT>

Teutons - If you want to take forward more than 3-4 villagers and stay in his base.
Spanish - If you take a few villagers forward and harass him to the point where you can go Castle without your base getting touched! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, no, it's not a thing certainly.
But it's a conscious choice.

Reasons being, in a highly competitive game, when you are slinging possibly one player, you can sustain his army production with around 150 villagers. You would hardly (probably never) see an expert Slinger (Slam?) make 200 villagers [if he is not doing caravans]. 

Also, there are games, where you see the Slinger has stopped villager production, because he is slinging in a very competitive battle where if he stops due to food being consumed for his villager production, the slingee can lose the battle and that can decide the faith of the game. :-) </TEXT>

You can choose to Sling in Feudal Age or even Castle Age.
After a certain point, you stop producing villagers and just produce good economy to support your team-mate/s. Remember, you need to continuously sling, don't let any of your resources cross 300! </TEXT>
