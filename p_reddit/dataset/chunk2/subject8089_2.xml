Not that I doubt you, because I don't...I've had enough firsthand experience with intentional communities here in the US to know how unusual it is for the kibbutz model to succeed...but there are no surviving old-school kibbutzim? Not *at all*?  That's very sad, indeed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I won't sit here and say I've never had a racist thought in my life, after all I'm only human. But I'd never degrade a person because of religious beliefs/ethnicity in a way that affects them personally.

I think that's what we call the difference between being human and being a contemptible piece of shit.

The truth is, every single human being harbors some form of ingroup/outgroup bias.  If nothing else, we all have some degree of implicit bias in favor of our "own" group and bias against certain subgroups of people based on these (very provable) phenomena.

When confronted with this reality, racists, xenophobes, and other bigots use the fact that it is ubiquitous as a way to excuse and rationalize their hatred and fear; better people seek do what you're talking about, which is A) not act on those thoughts, and B) when you have them, examine them critically -- aka, "don't believe everything you think." </TEXT>

They would be proud of my commitment to education and the value I have placed on it in my life, my honesty and great compassion for others, my work ethic,  and the effort I have put into being a good parent and instilling the most important of my deeply held values in my own child.


They would be horrified that I no longer practice Judaism, especially that I do not keep the Sabbath or adhere to the dietary prohibitions of kashrut ("keep kosher"), they would be scandalized that I married (and divorced) a non-Jew, and they would be stricken with grief and confusion that I chose not to circumcise my son when he was 8 days old. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think you understood my comment at all.

First, a big part of my point was that from ages 0 - 13, I never experienced antisemitism, nor did I experience any that made me fearful from ages 14 - over 40.  And that when I  *did* experience it, the event was so jarring that it stuck with me for decades.  So, your assertion that I should be "pro-Israel" based on "all the antisemitism" is not consistent with my story.

Another part of my point was that even though I was raised in a very pro-Israel, somewhat insular Jewish community that was *overwhelmingly* Zionist, I, personally, never was...for a variety of reasons that are not the point here but that have a lot to do with the idea that A) 2 wrongs don't make a right and B) that systematically shitting on people is a pretty poor foundation for a "holy land."

Many elements of Zionist ideology/policy have always struck me as lacking internal coherence...What I'm saying is that *despite* the fact that I still feel this way, the level of antisemitism that is visible and accepted in the U.S. has risen so markedly over the past few months that I am seriously examining whether I am safe in the community where I live and wondering whether Israel, will all of its warts, wouldn't be a better option.

  Maybe it was always there and just now people are blaming it on Trump? 

It *was* always here...in a latent form that would occasionally bubble over.  The difference is that being openly antisemitic was socially unacceptable in most places in the U.S. **As it fucking should be**.  Do people have a right to feel/believe whatever fucked up bigoted thing they want?  Sure.  Do I, as an individual, and my community, as a whole, have the right to apply social pressure (what academics call informal social control) to signal that those beliefs, and especially acting on those beliefs, is abhorrent?  You better fucking believe it.

Now, however, those who have held those latent bigoted opinions are emboldened to openly express their hatefulness.  The fact that this newly found "courage" to express these vile beliefs comes on the heels of the election of the current president is no coincidence.  He didn't create the hatred that exists in the U.S., but his rise to power, despite, perhaps even *because* of, his own bigoted beliefs, has made it acceptable, almost fashionable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh.  I'm in the mood for a reddit STEM circle-jerk telling me that all of my choices are wrong and my education is worthless, I guess.

My major is (interdisciplinary) social science, with concentrations in political science and geography.  Sort of by accident, I have a triple minor in Spanish, international studies and cultural anthropology.

I have absolutely loved being in college as an adult and 3 months from graduation, I would select my chosen program all over again.  By starting at my local community college and then transferring to a very inexpensive state university, I have been able to study exactly what is important and valuable to me without worrying about being buried under massive student loan debt come graduation.

Prior to returning to school, I worked in state government for 8 years, but was unable to advance further without a degree.  When I graduate in May, my intention is to either return to state government (where I am vested in the pension system) in a higher graded position or, to return to the legal or nonprofit fields, in which I also have substantial experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely agree, and I say that as someone who had never so much as watched a full period of hockey before my son started playing at age 11.

The very best thing about hockey, at least at first, was that it is sooo much fun to watch.  You don't have to know a single thing about the game to enjoy watching it, and once you start watching, it won't take you long to figure things out...at least well enough to feel like you know what's going on.

I agree with the family thing, too.  With the exception of a handful of "magic hockey helmet" type parents, the vast majority of hockey people have been enormously welcoming, friendly, and helpful...it's like they love the game so much, they just want to share it with everyone around them.

I grew up in a football house, but I'd rather watch hockey almost any day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Jews have been able to assume immense white privilege in this country and because of this, I feel, anti-Semitism has been given a pass because Jews are presumably white and rich.

This is spot on.

I would add that the amount of passing-as-white-privilege enjoyed by the average American Jew is anything but inconsequential, which creates an...interesting sort of tension between us and other historically marginalized communities.  There's always some element of "crabs in a barrel" when talking about inter-minority relations (witness the crazy tensions between Black and Latino people in this country), but the tenor of this strained relationship is qualitatively different when it comes to the Jewish community. I definitely think this has to do with an unspoken idea that the economic advantages enjoyed by many (but not all!) American Jews turns any antisemitic words or deeds into a form of punching up...which is culturally acceptable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, so I was halfheartedly trying to keep the subtext of my comment as subtext, but yes.  Exactly that.

I grew up in a large suburb of Washington, DC, in an area with a sizable Jewish population.  As a child, I was lucky to be insulated from most antisemitism; my mother had to apply for a scholarship for me to attend a private Jewish school (because, despite rumors to the contrary, we *aren't* all rich), but she did that because she had seen more than her fair share of prejudice and nastiness when she attended the very same neighborhood public schools growing up.  My very first encounter with people who were actually prejudiced against *me* (mind. blown.) occurred when I began public school in 8th grade.  Most of the comments were just ignorant -- usually not malicious, but sometimes hilarious in the profundity of the lack of knowledge they belied.  I legit had more than one kid me where my tail was -- and at *least* one of them was dead fucking serious. He was more than a touch concerned -- like I had lost it in a horrific industrial tail-lopping accident.  Since I had never seen bigotry against Jewish people before, I had no reason not to assume good faith from them, and while I was sometimes confused by how little they seemed to understand, there was no reason for me to be *scared* of them.

But there was one incident that taught me that antisemitism comes in forms other than uninformed foolishness.  In classic middle school fashion, another girl decided on the very first day of school that she didn't like the cut of my jib.  A few weeks later, when she could no longer contain her need to remind everyone that she was top bitch, she ambushed me with a group of her friends in the PE locker room.  As she pushed me up against the wall, one of her friends grabbed my hair, and started knocking my head back into the cinder block.  It wasn't the searing pain in my skull that grabbed my attention, though.  It was the venom in her voice as she hissed that I was a "**dirty kike**" who had "better stop acting like you're somebody, 'cuz you ain't shit."

I now live in a much more rural area, about 3 hours away from home, in a deeply red county.  Over the past 4 months, for the first time since I was a child, there have been several occasions when I have been legitimately fearful about my safety because of my Jewishness.  The multiple incidences of Jewish cemetery desecration in major cities are chilling...but so are the hateful graffiti and flyers that went up all over my campus on election night.  So is the fact that 4 days after the election, a local man in my town walked up to a black woman standing in line at the register at Walmart, put his items on the belt in front of hers, looked at her and said, "I'm first.  You're gonna wanna get used to that now."

I was raised steeped in Jewish culture and I received formal religious education from the age of 3 onward, but since I was old enough to be aware of the issue, I have had *serious* problems with Zionism.  The past several weeks are literally the first time in my life I have ever considered claiming my birthright, if that gives you any idea of how bad I think things are likely to get.

	<TEXT> [Your high school didn't have them?](http://www.kylgrafx.com/mojo/images/major07-1.jpg)

It used to be a feminine counterpart to a drum major.  They often march at the front of parades with the marching band. (For the good ones), their performance involves some pretty neat twirling and tossing of batons in intricately choreographed routines.  At my high school, they typically had a few-minute routine of their own during the halftime show.

The cheerleaders and poms were merciless to them, though...there was a distinct, strictly enforced hierarchy of sport-auxiliary activities, and the only ones below the majorettes in terms of status were the poor flag girls.

	<TEXT> Huh.  That's pretty much the opposite from what I've seen.

I'm a 40-something college student who lives in a small college town.  My  experience, both here and 20-ish years of living in and around College Park, is that liquor stores are *more* strict in college towns with respect to vertical IDs, not less, because the incidents of attempted fraud/purchase by minors is so much greater in those areas.

Certainly, though, this is much like anything else...highly variable from individual location to individual location, and OP could luck out if the climate in his college town is pretty chill.  My only real point was that it's policy, not law (in most places), that drives liquor stores' refusals to sell to people with vertical IDs, and that's because the civil/administrative penalties hurt **a lot**. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Jesus tastes like chicken." Nice one.

I have a similar tale.  In my junior year, several students developed a suspicion that our world history teacher wasn't reading our papers, either, but rather, handing out grades based on who he *thought* was a good student.

A good friend of mine sat next to me in his class; the teacher liked me because I was typically quiet and studious (read: nerdy), but was not a fan of hers because she was a majorette (and therefore, obviously an airhead).

So we decided to test the theory. She and I wrote identical papers, but I inserted a chocolate chip cookie recipe in the middle of one of my body paragraphs.

She got a B- and I got an A.

	<TEXT> Every state's law is different, but it's unlikely that the state where you go to school has any overt legal prohibition against selling alcohol to a person with an under 21 ID.

The much bigger (and more common) issue is that most places that sell liquor have a strict *policy* not to sell to anyone with an under 21 ID, *especially* an out-of-state vertical ID, simply because it's just too much of a risk to take.  A single sale to a minor can cost the clerk *personally* over $10,000.  So even though they technically *can* take it, they won't. </TEXT>

If your shelter and food expenses exceed your income, you will likely qualify. A caveat to be aware of is that as a college student (in most, if not all states) you have to work a minimum of 20 hours per week to be eligible for SNAP assistance.  However, since you were just hired, there is a wage verification form they should be able to use (your employer completes it) rather than having you submit pay stubs.

Even if you won't be eligible for long, you need food now.  *Please* ask for the help that's available to you; that's why it's there. </TEXT>

You're not crazy.  It sounds like you have given this more than adequate reflection, and in a way that is far more dispassionate than I, certainly, was able to be in a similar situation.

While it's true that it's not OK to demand of another person that she come out, or for you to dictate when it must happen, it is also true that you have an absolute right to not be treated like your partner's dirty little secret. For me, my ex-girlfriend's unwillingness to acknowledge the nature of our relationship to her parents or our co-workers (after 7 years!) was incredibly invalidating, humiliating, hurtful, and ultimately, infuriating.

The fact that your girlfriend established a timeline for telling her brother and then made (half-assed) excuses for why she didn't honor her word is of particular concern to me.

You ask a number of really good questions:

 I feel like maybe she cant get the words out because deep down, she isnt sure she wants to be with me, or isnt sure she wants to marry another woman.

and 

 Is it working out her own hesitation about marrying a woman and losing all the hetero-privilege? 

In my situation, there was absolutely an element of both of these issues.  And it was sad, because I knew that she would end up living a life that was far less authentic and joyful than the one she might have, just so that she could maintain her privilege.  But eventually, my sadness about it turned to contempt.  Because, frankly, to cultivate one's invisibility so that one can avoid having to stand up as a member of a marginalized group or speak out against bigotry is an act that belies a profound lack of integrity.  And no matter how great she and I were together in so many other ways, I don't want to spend my future with someone whose values are so very different from mine.

Again, I don't think you are being in any way crazy or unreasonable about your plan to end the relationship.  It sounds like you are a really thoughtful, special person, and you deserve a life partner who is bursting with pride over you -- a girl who wants to shout from the rooftops about how much she loves you.  You're worth that.  All of us are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. That's not what happens at all.[This NYT article describes what really happens when you insert a profit motive into the education of young children.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/for-detroits-children-more-school-choice-but-not-better-schools.html?_r=0) Bonus: It profiles Michigan, where DeVos has already had an opportunity to demonstrate what a miserable failure her charter plan is.

I've noticed a theme in your comments throughout this thread, so I recognize that "competition" and "free market" are ideological, almost religious, concepts to you. That means I'm probably wasting my breath, but I'll point out that there are absolutely industries/sectors of the economy where (typically for reasons of ethics, the public good, or both), public endeavors are not only inherently better than private ones, but in some cases are the only ethical means of providing a good or service to all who require it.  Public education is one such area (as are prisons, for example). 

Your kneejerk hatred of teachers' unions and willingness to paint all of them with the same broad, tarry brush is both unwarranted and telling.  While it's true that most unions have some degree of problem with working too diligently to retain sub-par teachers, that represents a tiny portion of what teachers' unions actually spend their time working on.  Teachers are professionals and the vast majority of them work their asses off at it for meager pay.  It is absolutely vital that so long as this toxic strain of anti-intellectualism and contempt for education persists in the U.S. that teachers continue to have the means to bargain collectively and speak in a united voice. 

Experience shows us (charter schools have been operating in earnest since the late '80s/early '90s) that what actually happens when you set up "school choice" is that a number of predictable and negative outcomes occur:

1. They are taken over by for-profit "education" companies that place profit over the quality of education provided to students.  They are run by people with business, not education degrees, and it is evident in the 'instruction' that occurs under their management.  The problem is that "businesspeople" are often loathe to admit, much less respect, the fact that education is an actual profession, one which requires expertise about a very particular set of things, not the least of which is the most effective, developmentally appropriate methods for teaching. I'll point out that what is being "produced" here are not widgets, but **children** who will (hopefully) become competent, contributing members of society.  It should also be noted that **the market often doesn't work here** because the consumers (parents) are not equipped to evaluate the substandard performance of the school.

2. Charter schools are often exempted from or subject to less stringent standards than those applied to public schools, meaning that there is often no meaningful way to even substantiate malfeasance until a great deal of harm has been done over the course of many years.

3. The profit motive leads to an alarmingly high rate of scandals and kickbacks within the charter school/private educational company industry that has cropped up since charter school legislation began to be enacted.  [Scandal after scandal after scandal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/09/09/how-messed-up-is-californias-charter-school-sector-you-wont-believe-how-much/?utm_term=.1515e42c1eb8)

TL; DR:  While there are certainly exceptions, charter schools are overwhelmingly a bad choice for the majority of children, and a number of systemic flaws make charter schools ripe for corruption and poor educational quality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Three exclamation points really aren't necessary.  First, ibuprofen and Advil are exactly the same thing. The former is the generic of the latter. Secondly, with respect to ibuprofen (aka Advil, Motrin, and many other brand names), [it seems it's really only a risk factor for GI bleeding with regular use.](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0501/p2863.html)

Now, with that said, there is a point that should be stressed: acetaminophen (aka Tylenol) can cause liver toxicity on its own in too-high dosages, and is exacerbated by alcohol consumption, so **acetaminophen (aka Tylenol) should never be taken when you have had 3 or more alcoholic drinks in a sitting**. </TEXT>
