	<TEXT> This AMA is awesome! Thanks (y) 
I am a network engineer and I'm very seriously looking into full time VA/pen-testing, however I have one major reservation- Documentation. 
How much of pen-testing is actually testing and how much of it is putting together a report. 
Like wise with actual Vulnerability Assessment and converting a Nessus scan to word. 
I get that documentation is necessary but what are ratios? I'm not really built to compile 300 page reports, just not really bent that way.
