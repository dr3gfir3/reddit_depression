	<TITLE> What were the Ancient Romans and Greeks' attitude towards technology? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-25 21:04:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the videogame Fallout New Vegas, Caesar's legion who are heavily inspired by Romans have a negative attitude towards technology. 

I wonder what were the real Romans' attitude to technology. According to a user in /r/Fallout,  (/u/detarame ) , "The Roman elite were very skeptical of technology in general. Cicero and his ilk often appreciated the utility of technology, but since they generally scorned doing the things technology usually improved (ie: work), they were only capable of a limited appreciation for the progress technological improvement allowed. Also worth noting that the Romans were a deeply conservative people and that slave based economies actually stifle innovation, because the people doing the work have no real incentive to improve their efficiency. Hell, the Greeks literally invented the STEAM ENGINE and dismissed it as a toy - as did the Romans - for the entire existence of their societies because who the hell needs machines to do work?" He also says that the Romans borrowed a lot of technology from other cultures.

Is this true? Did they view technology with suspicion? Did they invent a steam engine and not use it? </TEXT>

It sucks when I create an underoptimized character, find that the game is kicking my ass and then I'm stuck with it. This is what happened to me in Pillars of Eternity. I didn't choose the right skills and, my character was getting its ass kicked. 

This is a singleplayer game. Who cares if I respec mid game after having finally understood some mechanics and read forum posts? Should I really have been required to do hours of research on optimal builds before starting the game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The part that I find interesting:
"From the beginning of this franchise ten years ago, we started dealing with -- well, the first thing we did was we started researching. We researched where technology is taking us. And what is happening in the biotechnology field. And that's where we hit, by totally layering it into our research.

And we looked at everything from scientific articles and things to philosophical articles and social commentary articles. So we did a lot of research in the beginning, in order to lay the groundwork for what Human Revolution was. And once we finished Human Revolution, we took that farther. So we begin by putting in all of - by kind of putting in all that focus into the initial research.

"And then we say to ourselves what our job is, and what I'm often saying to the team is, our job is to hold a mirror up to the world. And expose it.

And allow -- because one of the precepts of Deus Ex is, we don't tell you what to think. You have to make your own decisions. You live it. And we try to present all sides of that issue to you. And that does get very challenging, as a writer, because you have to be constantly questioning your own biases, many of which you may not even know you have.

So you have to kind of always be looking at things from all sides. And present it from one side, then look at it and figure out okay, how do I present it from the other side? And it's a very difficult thing, and a lot of the time you do run into situations where people on the team will be like, this is too controversial. We can't put this in. This is too much, we can't do that.

And then we kind of have to talk that out, and say, if we approach it with as much respect as possible, and if we remember what we're trying to do here is tackle deep issues and show the world is shades of grey, and always allow the player to decide, not try to inflict a judgment. But it does put us into scary territory."

I don't think there's any other game that has a writing process like this, trying to incorporate deep questions about science and philosophy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't get into the game either.

As /u/Vertex19 said, the writing is bad. That was supposed to be Obsidian's strong point. But companies change over time. Or maybe they spent too much time on the engine and didn't have time polishing the game. But I don't think that's the case since the expansion seems to be just as boring. 

They wanted to mimic Icewind Dale and make a game focused on action instead of story. I think they failed and that it was a bad idea. Icewind Dale is a generic Dnd adventure with lots of fighting and too little interesting story content. 

And I've seen very few users on Reddit defend the game. The sub has been dead since release. It seems that there just aren't any cool moments to share with other players.

It's kind of a slap in the face for Josh Sawyer too who was the lead designer. Out of the games he's made, only Fallout New Vegas really turned out to be awesome. NWN2 was pretty bad, at least the base campaign. Alpha Protocol had potential. I kind of see a pattern though. Icewind Dale, PoE and NWN2 all have in common that they have pretty bad generic DnD stories. Exactly the kind of thing that Chris Avellone brilliantly subverted and made fun of in Planescape Torment, and to some extent in KOTOR2. 
(The fact that Alpha Protocol and Fallout New Vegas had dedicated writers might further explain why their stories didn't suck.)

Edit: Good explanation by /u/Coolthulu of why the story sucks: https://www.reddit.com/r/projecteternity/comments/4jm03i/pillars_of_eternity_ii_is_already_in_production/d393gjt </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While you're mostly right, I don't want to be too negative. Let's wait and see.

But obviously this won't solve any of the core problems with the game. Not that I'm surprised. With their previous game (CIM2), CO only released cosmetic DLC. At least this time, it's a little bit more substantial. But they seem totally unwilling to rethink their game and make more basic changes. 

Paradox is frisky about investing money into non revenue-generating activities, but CO is ten times worse. They don't seem to be willing to invest their time/money into something that won't be sold. Also, the success of Cities:Skylines, doesn't seem to have caused them to increase their staff.

Can't help but contrast this with Blizzard which has invested into countless free updates for their games (incoming SC2 major patch, major D3 content added after expansion). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is static, not real time generation. Here's an explanation:  http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131507/a_realtime_procedural_universe_.php

"A static algorithm is one that generates a static mesh of vertices or height values. The most common form generates a 2D bitmap of height values, then uses the bitmap to build a triangle mesh for a flat landscape. While some static algorithms are very good, they all suffer from two crippling problems. The first is that you need a ridiculously large mesh to get any detail for a full-size planetary body. The second is that the speed of the algorithm depends on the size of the mesh.

To give you an idea of the size we're talking about with planetary bodies, an order-10 sphere based on an icosahedron (20 * 410 triangles) has almost 21 million triangles in it. For a planet the size of Earth, the triangle edges would be 300km long. The edges for an order-20 sphere (22 trillion triangles) would be 0.3km long. It would be ridiculously slow, take up an enormous amount of storage space, and still wouldn't be able to show you details on individual hills or mountains. In that light, it seems that the only feasible way to generate a planet is to come up with something more dynamic.

My definition of a "dynamic" algorithm is an algorithm that takes some sort of vertex coordinates as parameters and returns the proper height value at those coordinates. These coordinates could be longitude and latitude, polar coordinates, 3D coordinates, or anything else you can think of that consistently and uniquely identifies a vertex. Paired with an adapting mesh algorithm such as the one that will be explained in Part 2 of this series, you would not need to store anything in memory or on disk except for the mesh you need to draw for that frame. The ideal algorithm would be initialized with a random seed and a number of defining parameters that would allow you to create a range of interesting planetary bodies from one algorithm." </TEXT>

This paper shows an interesting approach that doesn't rely on a simulation: http://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/aigaion2root/attachments/derzapfPlanets.pdf It starts from the ocean and moves up to mountains. 

The problem with rivers and lakes is that they are shaped by the geography of an entire region. This means analyzing the topography before drawing the river, which cannot be done in real time. Also, erosion takes place over thousands of years and would require a simulation which also cannot be done in real time. Hence the need for some trickery.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Flavien Brebion (of Infinity Battlescape) is an awesome programmer and has been working on procedural planets for years. This latest trailer is amazing and I wish that more people supported Infinity.

But... I think that's he's definitely underestimating the time that content takes to produce. He was developing his own MMO alone, for years, constantly rewriting his engine, which is about as far as a one man team can get. 

It seems like things are going better since he restarted his project with crowdsourcing, but he does not have the marketing ability that CR has to raise millions upon millions with professionally produced commercials and the clever idea of selling spaceships. </TEXT>

The other thing that I'm not seeing are biomes/plants/animals, which is fine really. It would be really cool if they added jungles teeming with life, boreal forests and ice caps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  To show how weak the systems were by having a much prettier PC version on such a large title would have been bad in a business sense. 

I don't think that's the case at all. It's just much simpler to have the game be as similar as possible across all platforms. Less time is spent developing and debugging. 

Would you have been okay with the game coming out 18 months later on PC and costing 30% more? The reality is that adapting a game engine and assets to a more powerful platform has a cost.

"Q:What were your thoughts on the graphical downgrade in the last game and how has this been addressed this time around?

A: One thing to remember is that the first showing of Watch Dogs came in summer 2012, before anyone knew what the Next Gen of consoles and hardware would be. We did our best at the time to predict what that would be and always were forward that this first showing was running on a very powerful PC.

For Watch Dogs 2, we are in a much more predictable context. We have been developing the game on our target platforms from the beginning. " </TEXT>

Not to nitpick since his point is about how gambling is bad, but I don't find gambling fun. Once I understood that no matter what I do in, say, a casino, I have 0% chance of winning, then gambling seemed very boring to me. Just stare at a screen and pull the lever over and over again. The only excitement comes from the possibility of winning, but that possibility isn't even real. </TEXT>

However, in most games it's hard to trade an item for real money and the developers frown upon it. So, it's harmless since it's all just for fun but it's still the same mechanics at work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, as Anandtech writes:

As AMD has made clear over the last several months, one of the major goals of Polaris was power efficiency, and this is where we see some of the first payoffs from that decision. RX 480s official Typical Board Power (TBP) is 150W, over 20% lower than the last-generation R9 380, and 45% lower than the otherwise performance-comparable R9 390. Consequently the card only requires a single 6-pin PCIe power connector for external power, making it a more friendly option for power-limited desktops that dont offer additional power connectors. (...)

So what lessons did AMD learn for Polaris? First and foremost, power efficiency matters. It matters quite a lot in fact. Every vendor  be it AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA  will play up their strongest attributes. But power efficiency caught on with consumers, more so than any other feature in the 28nm generation. Though its importance in the desktop market is forum argument fodder to this day, power efficiency and overall performance are two sides of the same coin.

They thought they could get away with it if the card appeared power-efficient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that this was almost certainly a poorly managed project. It's part of the risk of backing a kickstarter. Something similar happened with Broken Age, except that they delivered a more satisfactory product in the end.

An important point is that kickstarter is not a store. When I back a project, I know that there's X% chance that I'll get what was promised, Y% that it will be better and Z% that it will be worse. There's an element of risk to backing. Some project managers and some teams are very good and some aren't. Many games never make it to release or don't meet expectations when they are released.  </TEXT>
