	<TEXT> Hey guys, I just bought my first bong! I've used my roommates, which is just a small $15 acrylic pipe. For a while, my roommate has been unhappy with it so I took it upon myself to buy a nice glass piece for us.

Picture: http://i.imgur.com/PfLBjMM.jpg

I wasn't sure how much water should you actually put in it? Do I just need enough to cover the stem in the bottom "bulb" of the pipe? I've barely used my roommates, and whenever I do he loads it up and I don't really notice I guess. Any general bong care I should be aware of?

Edit: This might be a stupid question, but the moment I "suck" on the pipe to bring the flame in, it immediately goes out and I get nothing. What am I doing wrong? :( </TEXT>

Could someone please share some insight on what healing at level cap is like as a Templar? I've tried looking over the official forums but they don't seem well laid out and it's just lots of people saying DK's are overpowered. </TEXT>

I'm looking for something like this, second page at the bottom of the right column:

Happened to mention my area code in a thread else where and got to talking to another Ent in the area and he hooked me up with a few numbers on where I might be able to get some.

Bit of coordination later and I made the most conspicuous transaction of my life and finally got some! Dude said it is a Girl Scout Cookie strain but I wouldn't know to be honest...

tl;dr You Ents are all awesome.

**Edit** Oh quick question actually. The bud I had from my brother would cherry like a motherfucker. Would barely light it and it'd just burn for a good 10 seconds. This stuff the fire goes out almost instantly. Is that indicative of anything? </TEXT>

This has been happening in some of my games, lately.

Of course you can just mouse over it and see the hard number, but regardless it's still a weird ass bug. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Could I get some advice on my Ele Buzzsaw gear? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey dudes, so I started playing very recently (on and off since beta, but never got past level 50 until this character at 73).

I'm playing [Mathil's Elemental Buzzsaw build](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/690708) and this is my gear:

http://i.imgur.com/y9UIVZW.jpg

Obviously Alpha's Howl is BIS but everything else is just OK. Then this morning I found those Maligro's Virtuosity. Below them I included the gloves I *was* wearing, because I don't know if I should sell Maligro's or not. They look pretty valuable on poe.trade ranging from 30C to 1 or 2 Ex?


Maligro's was about a 200 DPS increase, almost 10% gains on my main Spectral Throw, but I lost a bit of Cold resistances and I can no longer use the Item Rarity on my "secondary" Spec Throw. My gems match up to the ones in the build linked above for his Scion. I only have like 3 or 4 Fusing's so it's unlikely I'd be able to 4L it. I have plenty of Chromatics to try and get GGRB though.

Despite the Alpha's Howl I'm actually pretty broke; 6  Chaos orbs and handfuls of other random orbs. I can't imagine I have more than 20C (at most) if I liquidated all my orbs.

What do you guys think I should do? Try and sell the Maligro's to get a 6L chest so I can add Faster Attacks support, try to upgrade my jewelry, keep the Maligro's? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just started playing about 8 or 9 days ago and I'm level 68 and running low level maps pretty comfortably. After buying some stuff I have 1 Chaos Orb, and a few other orbs of similar value (a few Vaals, Regals etc) but not many.

* Are any certain types of semi-common items that are almost always worth picking up and trying to sell?

* Obviously 5L or 6L chests / weapons are good, but what about 4L gloves/helm/boots?

* I have a 6S chest but it's not fully linked, is that total garbage? Do people roll through tons of fusings and chromatics trying to make it perfect, or is that only done on otherwise already perfect gear. This is just a white lvl 58 Loricated Ringmail with Armor and Energy Shield

* What are "good" stats on non-weapons? Resistances, max life, damage?

I'm aware of the Chaos Orb(s) vendor recipe, but I never seem to find rare jewelry. Same with the Fusing recipe for 6S stuff, and Chromatics from 'rainbow' linked items. Other than that... I have no idea what I can do to start gaining currency early on. </TEXT>

I'm level 51 and I've completed the entire Right hand side of the passive web in that second link. I've started the "bottom" link of passives and am making my way right. I'm about halfway through Act 3 Cruel.

I am not sure however if I should make my way up and to the right towards that cluster of +Elemental Damage node, or just blitz to the left for the Aura mana reduction / effect increase.

I only have the Elemental Weapon Damage and running Hatred while I try to get the other gems outlined on that build page. Which way do you guys think I should go? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> At what point do you think smoking too much is a problem, if it is at all? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-18 22:45:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a pretty new ent, I'd say I only REALLY started smoking in late October / early November, though technically I started in early September.

For the first two weeks of December, I was out of work (company temporarily told all the contract workers to get bent) for 2 weeks and smoked probably 10 of those 14 days. Since being back to work this week, I've still smoked each day this week if you count the small hit I took last night to help me sleep.

I work from home full time and I have almost no work to do, as the company is "layering" the temporary unemployments so most of my team is either on vacation or out of work. So this leaves me bored **as fuck**.

Between the boredom, smoking being a new thing, minor bouts of depression, and just genuinely enjoying smoking... It's like the only thing I want to do lately.

I don't know, I wish I could I could motivate myself to do something productive with all this spare time while having no real work to do. I haven't smoked on the clock yet but damn the temptation is real, man. I guess between me just generally not being a motivated person I'm sort of afraid of getting 'mentally addicted' and just fully embrace being lazy as fuck.

I generally agree with the sentiment that "pot doesn't make you lazy; you're lazy and also you smoke"

Soo... I dunno... just curious what you all think of smoking very frequently when you have nothing you need to do? There are a handful of other hobbies I'm interested in or want to pick up that I could do during this downtime, but anytime I start I just get distracted and quit quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently started smoking, and I moved to a new city / state about a year ago... Haven't made a ton of new friends, none that I'm remotely close to anyways. My roommate knows someone who knows someone to buy off of, but it's kind of a crappy situation- live far away and I feel like an inconvenience going through them.

I was gunna try and ask a guy I know who smokes (cigarettes) heavily, drinks fairly heavily- seems like he'd be the type of dude that wouldn't care if someone smokes or not. But part of me is just like SUPER PARANOID if like what if he's brother's a cop or who knows what.

How the hell do you find a dealer, or other ents? Am I just making a way bigger deal of this than I should be? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like HS and have been playing since the beta, but every time I play it I'm always surprised how ghetto the client feels.

* No borderless window
* The options menu doesn't have any "close" button
* Have to re-launch the game if you accidentally disconnect during a match
* Not able to see how much gold you have / quest progress in a match

Let's face it, we all love Blizzard because they tend to put a ton of effort into releasing a truly AAA product with immense polish. But this game feels like they got it to "publicly available beta status" and then completely stopped touching the client. Have they talked about improving the client at all? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anything I can do about a dealership's negligence? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-11 00:03:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 5,000 miles ago I had a Nissan dealership replace my serpentine belt. The other day I went on a road trip to a different state, went throw a toll booth and slowed down. Sped up after passing through it, when suddenly my battery and brake lights came on and my power steering went. 10 PM and single digit temperatures, I toughed it out and drove the 10 miles to my buddy's house. Next morning I drove it to a nearby garage per my friend's recommendation. Mechanic lifts up my car in front of me and we both saw a bunch of bolts were missing, or not put on tight and then obviously the belt was half off.

He only billed me $30 for half an hour labor, and all my friends are saying I should "go after" the dealership for doing a half-ass job. But I have no way to prove any of this, the repairs happened in a different state and the invoice just has the labor on it. No details of what was actually done or anything. Would I be wasting my time, or could I get some money back from the dealership do you think? </TEXT>

I assume because women sit down they would be unaware of it? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I went to college for software engineering and graduated a few years ago. A friend of mine I met in school graduated a year ahead of me. Fast forward to now, I have a pretty decent job that pays very well and it's cushy as fuck. Work remotely any time I want and have very little work to do which leaves me with a lot of free time on the clock.

He on the other hand is still working a minimum wage job in an office with his mom. He has two siblings, his mother, and his father passed away some time before I met him (so at this point it's been more than 6 years) and lives at home with them all.

The thing is though, he's done nothing with his degree. I don't think he's ever interviewed for a position in his field and I've never heard him talk about finding a different job or anything. I've tried to help him out, when I left my last job (in-field) I asked if he wanted me to give his resume to my boss and he said yes.

Anyways, lately anytime something work related comes up he always seems to have a comment about how I never work / get to play video games all the time. For example, this Friday I worked 2PM - 2 AM but a lot of it was "wait for the other team to finish an update before I can test my changes" so it was more like just be indefinitely tethered to my computer until they say I can go and at like 1:45 me and a few friends are on voice chat and he said something about how I 'never actually work'. But it just has this snarky tone and lately it's really starting to piss me off and I just generally avoid talking to him lately. It's not just general men ball-busting each other, it has just that little bit of jealous sound to it.

I mentioned this to a mutual friend of ours, who is kind of the "glue" in this particular circle of friends. He felt that I should confront the other guy and just tell him to knock it off, but the thing is I don't really *care*. I'm fine avoiding him and only having minimal interaction, but my other friend is making it out like I have some moral obligation to try and help him or something. We've never been particularly close, it's what I'd call a "superficial" friendship where 99% of the conversation is mutual hobbies. Never anything "deep" or personal.

Not really sure what I should do... </TEXT>

http://i.imgur.com/KPjLubH.png

My 2 roommates and I currently live in a 2 BR with one of us living in the living room. Obviously not an ideal situation. Just poking around on CL and came across this. I called the number and was told the house is in foreclosure and we'd have the option of signing over the loan to one of our names, or simply pay monthly and rent it. He told me to go online to some website and sign up to fill out an application, to which I said I'm at work and would call back later. Feel like if it were a legit thing they'd just put the website in the post?

The apartment is down near Niagara and Virginia street. I don't know the area well at all, I moved to Amherst a year ago and have been into the actual city all of maybe 2 or 3 times?

One roommate said "I don't believe a house like that exists in that area". Looks too good to be true, so it probably is. The piss poor grammar in the post further leads me to believe it's a scam. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been depressed for a long time but only now trying to get help. A year ago I moved far from home for work and since moving here I've made 0 friends. I knew my roommate before moving here and he's my best and oldest friend, then I have another roommate who I like but we're not super close. The latter is barely around and is always at his girlfriend's place. The former recently has been seeing a girl a lot lately which leaves me by myself.

Like I think many others here, it's these "idle times" that are the worst where all the toxic thoughts and self loathing pour into my head and lately it's getting the best of me. I just don't know what to do... Once per week I go out and play D D with a group I found online but I don't feel like I fit in, as I never have anywhere in life. That is the full extent of my social life. Don't fit in at work, don't really have any hobbies and my depression hinders any attempt I make at new things.

What do you guys do when you have nothing to do, Reddit is slow, etc.? I'm going out of my mind tonight and can't sleep :(  I've been having days like this more and more recently </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Thinking of selling my Z... What are your thoughts? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-21 01:22:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've had my '03 Z for 1 year and 7 months as of today, and I absolutely love it to death. It only has about 64K miles on it, and is in pretty solid shape.

The reason I'm considering selling it though is because *ideally* I want to get a replacement DD and turn my Z into a track project... But with massive student loans and my living situation (apartment complex; might be moving to a city w/o off-street parking) it's really not feasible to own two cars.

I don't know, I could pay it off by January probably and then that'd be $400/mo more in my pocket (I'm paying roughly double my min payment) to do whatever I wanted, financially. But it just seems so impractical unless I had like a house and my own garage and whatnot for 2 cars. Also I sort of feel like the wiser thing would be to put the money I'd be saving by *not* having a car payment towards my student loans, get out of debt faster and then have some serious cash to play around with...

Sorry, that was a little bit longer than I wanted it to be I'm just really frustrated and unhappy lately =[ Looking to get some other peoples' opinions </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to D D despite playing a fair amount of 3.5, 4, and now 5. I just never really got into more "advanced" mechanics. I was thinking of making a Human Monk and foregoing the +1 to every Ability Score in exchange for +1 to two of them, and starting with the Grappler feat at level 1.

Grappling reduces the victims speed to 0, and they cannot benefit from speed increasing effects. I can move at half my speed and drag them along with me. Then with the feat, I'd gain Advantage against my target so I could use my bonus action for another unarmed attack, and you can pin them as well. Additionally, enemies that are one size larger don't automatically escape the grapple.

Am I missing something? It seems a little... Underwhelming? A few friends say it's a really powerful mechanic but can't really elaborate as to why. </TEXT>

* MSI P67A-G45 mobo
* i7 2600k (3.4 Ghz, Sandy Bridge), not overclocking it
* 8 GB of RAM
* GTX 580
* 128 GB SSD boot drive + 1 TB HDD

I'm not really sure where my biggest bottle neck is- I feel like all of it's kind of low at this point.
Part of me wants to just be really irresponsible and build a whole new rig but I know I shouldn't. So I was hoping I could get away with a GTX 980 and a new CPU or something but I don't know what's the latest architecture to see if it's compatible with my socket (1155 LGA).

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My serpentine belt has been squealing like a bitch, but it was replaced about 10K miles ago. A mechanic told me the actually pulley needs to replaced, which should be expensive because they need to pull the radiator to get at it- or so they told me. Quoted me around ~700 parts   labor.

Other than that, my brake pads have been also squealing a bit but the same mechanic said they should be "good for at least 5K more miles". I suspect the dealership I bought my Z from probably just used the cheapest of the cheap pads when I bought the car-- they sure did with the MSRP $70 all seasons that were on it.

What else might I expect? When I bought the car last February I did pick up an extended warranty just because it's an '03 so I'm really hoping the first issue is covered (need to read through the paperwork) but I suspect any non-critical replacements won't be covered. </TEXT>

I've decided to get back into D D and picked up the 5E PHB at my local shop last night to quickly join in on an encounters campaign and quickly rolled a Dwarf Fighter. I want to join a different campaign in addition, though, but I want to play something different for once. I haven't decided whether I'll be a Sorcerer, Wizard, or Warlock but I know it'll be one of those three. I've read over their classes, I've read over the spell chapter but I still don't really "get" it.

What's the difference between Cantrips versus what's in my Spellbook, or example? Just hoping someone could simply give a run-down of how being a caster actually works in D D, please :( </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've never really been a healthy person when it comes to my diet, but when I was young I was pretty physically active so it didn't matter. Fast forward 6 years and I weigh 215 pounds at my worst. Many on-and-off session at the gym and I'm down to about 200 now. Took another break this summer, but I'm back at it again. I downloaded MyFitnessPal and I've been tracking everything I eat for the past 2 weeks or so.

Lately, the past week, I've been very prone to that sort of dizzy feeling you get when you get up from laying down too quickly. The past two days this feeling has lingered from when I get out of bed for *at least* an hour.

According to MyFitnessPal, my sugar intake has been about half of what it says I'm allowed. Last week I consumed about 254 out of 497 grams of sugar. I used drink lots of soda and junk food, so I'm hoping my body is just still adapting to my new diet where I'm trying to be healthier. In the past 2 weeks I've only had a small soda twice, though I haven't been able to cut my addiction to energy drinks (usually get the zero calorie ones).

Just wondering if anyone can weigh in as to whether or not this is normal / related? I have an unrelated doctor's appointment next Friday, so I'll bring it up if it's still going on...

	<TITLE> How To Get a 100% work-from-home job? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-08 22:02:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **tldr;** I currently work from home 3-4 days/wk and want to move back to my home state without giving up my job that has no *real* reason for me to go into the office. How can I bring this up at work?


**Long version;**
I'm 2 years out of school, and have been working at my current employer for just shy of 1 year (in a week or two it'll be 1 yr). This is on a rolling 6-month contract and I recently just got another extension. I moved fairly far away for this job, about 500 miles, and for many small reasons (very unhappy with my new region) I really want to move back. My actual boss works in a different state, but I still sort-of report to a few managers at my office just as general 'updates' as to what I'm working on and such but they do not delegate any tasks to me at all.

I normally work 3 or 4 days per week from home as is (as do most of the people on my team), but I'll go in on occasion just for a change of pace or if I have one of those menial meetings to attend, or if a big fish from corporate is visiting.

Ultimately though, there's really no major reason I have to be in the office.

I don't really want to look for a new job, my first job out of college lasted a little over a year counting the internship, then this one would only be a year and I'd feel stupid when asked why I'm leaving my answer would be so I could live back in my home area. I'm mostly happy where I work (aside from getting strung along as a contractor, anyways). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After a bit of a hiatus from the gym, I'm back at it again :(

One thing that's always given me trouble is after a work out I'm absolutely starving but feel like I shouldn't eat. Generally, I don't do breakfast (or maybe a protein bar from the convenience store at most), have a burger at work, come home and eat dinner then two hours later I'll go to the gym and burn ~600 calories if the tracker of the machines are remotely accurate.

So that's about 1/3 of my daily intake-- actually don't think I even take in 1800. When I get home and relax for thirty minutes, I'm absolutely starving. I feel like I could eat a full second dinner. But then I really don't think I should eat anything because I want to drop 20 pounds by winter (~205 right now)

Just wondering if at some point this goes away as my body gets used to it, or should I just put a little peanut butter on some crackers and deal with it, or...? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to a three-year college and had a fairly untraditional education and frankly don't think it was a very good one. I've been out of school for two years, my first job was very easy and everyone wrote awful code. Zero separation from UI   logic, it was exactly like what I was doing as a first-year student.

Knowing if I stayed there my skills wouldn't grow at all and I had no where to go (tiny company), I found a better job at a huge, global company.

I've been here for almost a year and in any project I've been assigned I just feel **so** lost. The senior devs on my team don't have a ton of patience for us juniors and it's at the point where I dread having to work with them, but my direct peers can only help so much

No idea what I can do to get better at coding and understanding our software, but as someone who *generally* learns most things in life very quickly I get tremendously frustrated with myself whenever I get stuck with things.

I guess ultimately I'm just wondering of there are any good books for general abstraction principles, design patterns, or just... Anything. I know how to write code, just not good code :P and I'm awful at jumping into existing code and trying to figure it out. </TEXT>

Am I alone in this sentiment, or does anyone else think so? I know ultimately it's my body and I'm not doing it for other people, so I guess I shouldn't care. But I can't help that I do :P

	<TEXT> In my early teens, I had an accident while rollerblading and knocked out my front tooth. I had a fake one molded to my retainer after I had braces, but as I get older I'm sick and tired of wearing a retainer and it was causing physical pain in my mouth. So more of than not I go without it, which leaves me missing one of my front teeth.

On a good day, I'd probably say I'm a 6/10 so this really doesn't help. I've been saving up to get laser eye surgery, but I'm wondering if I should put that money towards a "proper", more permanent solution to my tooth problem instead.

* How long should I wait in between coats?
* Does the weather effect it? I know that it's generally a poor idea to spray paint in a humid environment, does this have the same problem? 60% Humidity today.
* Most videos seem to focus on the "outside" of the wheel, any special tips for doing the back side or just treat it the same; block off the tires and spray away?
* How long to wait until mounting them to my car?
* How does plastidip handle going through a car wash? I don't have access to do-it-yourself car wash anywhere near me, nor does my apartment have water outside. </TEXT>

I wasn't a huge fan of Goreshade 1   2, but 3 seems really interesting.

I know the model hasn't been out for a while, but the rules have been in War Room for a good bit. Has anyone here played with him? How is he? All of my Cryx stuff got damaged months ago and need to be reassembled before I can play them again so I've not tried to proxy a game yet.

I think this is the list I'd want to run:
http://imgur.com/1lecoZS

Lead up with the Bile Thralls, clear as much as I can, get the McThralls in and feat. Follow up with the Brute Thralls for some strong hits, then finally the Banes to do the real heavy lifting. Harrower for the easy stationary hits and slight ranged support. I'd *love* to find a way to fit the Kraken in for fun, but I don't see how I could really afford to :(

Any suggestions / input would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I bought my car last year, but because of a low down payment, car's age, and it being my first auto-loan I have a 9 or 10% interest rate, despite having an excellent credit score.

I just got something in the mail, normally I throw all spam out, but this caught my interest. Basically just says you have a great credit score, refinance your loan with us and get "as low as" 3.9% APR.

There's some ID number on the letter saying to go online, enter that, and fill out a form, or call and speak to a sales rep. I hadn't done that because it wanted my SSN and other contact information, which I prefer not to give out to arbitrary companies that mail me things.

Like I said, normally I throw spam out but the way this was packaged piqued my interest (as if that were accidental). Their website looks pretty shitty ( https://www.alliancedirectlending.com/ ) and the fact that it was unsollicited seems kind of shady... But I know I'm getting fucked on my car, but most "regular" banks won't touch it because of its age.

Has anyone heard of this company or been through a similar experience? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 7 Months ago I moved 400 miles from home to live with my best friend at a new job. Unfortunately (not to sound racist/xenophobic) all of my coworkers are foreign so there's a huge language / culture barrier. I've always had a tough time making new friends, so this has been particularly shitty. Literally the only people I know are my 2 roommates, 1 of whom I'm good friends with and the other I like but I feel like we're only friends because of a mutual friend (the other roommie), and my 4 coworkers.

Both of the roommates are still in school and don't have much money, so they often have no money to do things, and I don't want to pay for them. I don't *mind* paying, but after a few times I feel like I'm just "buying" friends even though one of them is my best friend.

Tonight, I asked if my friend wanted to go out for drinks but he already had plans pending with the other roommate + his coworkers. He (my good friend) said I was welcome to join, but I said no because I feel like a "parasite"-- only invited along because I asked if he wanted to do something unaware of his plans, not because they wanted me to go.

I do have a few hobbies I could theoretically meet people through, but the idea of just going out on my own and trying to get to know people just **seriously** makes me uncomfortable, but I'm going to be alone and unhappy until I do.

I know I need to get out there and meet new people, but I just can't bring myself to do it. For those of you who have been in a similar situation, how the hell do I get over this? I'm sick and tired of spending every night in, but I haven't made a single new friend since I started college 6 years ago and the thought of going out and simply talking to new people scares the shit out of me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now that winter *finally* seems to have passed, planning on buying new tires and wheels to go with. I don't really want to pay all the extra money for a proper powder coat, so I'm considering dipping them, but I don't want a matte color.

* How many cans of paint would be necessary for 4 wheels?
* How many cans of the gloss coat?
* Do you do the same number of coats with the gloss as you do the actual paint?
* Is the primer necessary?

Want to do a gloss white over some 18" T6S's. Also any general tips would be appreciated. I checked out a few videos on YouTube, seems super straight forward, but any tips would be appreciated :) Tires won't be mounted to the wheels yet, so should be nice and easy. </TEXT>

I just got my helmet so I can start tracking the car, I didn't realize how... tall it is. Combined with how far forward I sit, there's not much head room and I'm afraid the helmet is going to be knocking against the ceiling (I'm at work and can't go out and sit in the car).

Is it possible to adjust how close / far the pedals are from the rest of the vehicle? That way I could bring them further out, push my seat back and have more room.

Does the Z have a seat height adjuster? I guess I don't remember, how often do you use it after it's been set :p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I had the opportunity to take my car to a track in Western / Central NY yesterday. 3 laps behind a pace car, took some photos but didn't stay long as it was very far from home:

Sadly I didn't have an opportunity to talk to the GT owner.

Here's a video of my time, as well:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOXdwAAWb34#t=238

I am now aware I am AWFUL at keeping my hands on the wheel and in good form. My glasses kept slipping too. I'm sure my lines were shit too :)

I was tremendously nervous, especially being at the head of the group. I had a CTS-V and a V8 Mustang behind me, and since it was opening weekend we were told no passing so I was afraid I was going to be super slow and ruin it for the guys behind me, but after the first lap or so I couldn't even see the Caddy in my mirrors at any point, so that helped relief a little "stress".

Best time I've had in a very long time, hope to get some proper time on the track this year without a safety car :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just used my GoPro for the first time and it's tremendously shakey. I decided to look up some stabilization software and it seems like a giant pain in the ass.

Why is it such a pain in the ass? I'll happily pay for a simple solution. </TEXT>

It was $25 for 3 laps with a pace car... Did 40-80 mph depending on where on the track I was. It was insanely fun for my first time experience. I was extremely nervous because I was leading the pack, only the pace car infront of me, I was afraid I was going to be so slow and piss off everyone behind me but after the first lap I couldn't even see the Caddy behind me from that first photo :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, like many others I was disappointed with the D3 launch and played PoE quite a bit as an alternative with **much** more depth. I really liked it, but something felt missing and I never got past level 50 or maybe 60.

Took a break probably around December last year, played a few other games and decided to give Reaper of Souls a chance. Much improved, but D3 is still very heavily one of those "The illusion of choice" kind of games, and I think I'm going to jump back into PoE.

I know an expansion came out a little while ago, but other than that is there anything really new in the PoE world / community? A big part of my issue was just being overwhelmed with the passive tree and not being able to come up with a build I liked, getting to mid/late game and realizing my character is garbage and needing to restart. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm by no means a great cook, but I'll do more than just freezer meals and garbage like that for my dinners. I've been getting better at coming up with stuff to do with my chicken, beef, steak, but I'm at a complete loss on how to make my veggies more "interesting".

This is probably a sin to say here, but I don't notice a difference between fresh, garden-fresh or frozen so I just buy frozen since it's easier. Usually get an assortment of peas, green beans, carrots, corn and sometimes broccoli. Generally just toss it in a bowl with a little bit of water and whatever seasoning I put on my meats. Add a pinch of butter afterwards, but it still usually just tastes *so* bland.

Any simple tips on things I can do to make it better / more interesting? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been single for a little over two years, now. Took me quite a while to get over it, first-and-only relationship of nearly 5 years. Probably about a year ago, maybe a little less, I signed up for OKC and POF. I've had absolutely no luck; the ones I message don't respond and the very few (3, maybe 4) that message me I haven't been interested in. I have had one semi meaningful extended conversation and that was because I wanted to give someone "a fair shot" after she messaged me and she was very clearly not over her ex so after two weeks I stopped talking.

In my profile I made mention that I moved to where I now live for work, and I worry that comes off like I'm some cocky big shot? I don't know.  I'm certainly no Adonis, but I wouldn't say I'm down right unattractive either. I try to send meaningful messages asking questions about things they mentioned in their profile rather than just a "Hi" or other brain dead sentence.

 Meanwhile my good friend has had fairly good success in just a few months, having been on a few dates in a short amount of time. Fruitless in the end, but it's better than nothing. I would say he is much more attractive, and I'm starting to get depressed thinking it is truly that simple. I understand everyone wants someone attractive, but both my "failures" and his success combined is really getting me down lately.


Sorry if this post sounds whiny, but I just don't understand. I've mostly got my shit together but no one will give me a chance.  I'm just tired not having anyone to talk to about my day, or listen to how their day was, etc.

**TL;DR** When you ladies get a message, really, what determines if you reply to them? Or I guess perhaps more importantly what would make you **not** reply? </TEXT>

It's an '03 350Z. The front bumper, the lowest part, is FULL of rock chips. It looks like it's been through hell. The hood has a suffered a small chip this winter, probably the size of a penny. You can very clearly see the silver / metal of the car. There are also 3 very very small scraps on the roof that have actually started to rust a little bit because I've been unable to get it taken care of this winter.

Just wondering if you guys think I should take it to a professional body shop, get the paint taken care of THEN have it detailed? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I've never been into cars until I bought this a year ago, now I absolutely love it and want to learn as much as I can. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My dad and I have never been close. As a young child he mostly travelled for a living. As I got older (10+), he got a new job where he mostly worked 6AM-2PM or so, would come home from work and nap for a few hours, cook dinner when I got home from school (on the nights that my mother worked, anyways) then he'd just go downstairs and drink and watch TV. I don't want to say he was an alcoholic, but... well.. he was. He wasn't physically abusive, and not really verbally abusive, just an asshole when he was drunk. 

He kept some part-time hours at his old job, and would usually work from about 4 AM - 11PM on Saturdays. Sunday's he'd mostly spend either sleeping, or doing chores around the house.

He always put the family first, I know that, and I respect his work ethic but I feel like I don't know him as a person at all. He never expressed interest in anything I've ever been into and doesn't seem to express interest in anything himself.

Six months ago I took a job 400 miles away from home, as a software developer. Both of my parents are quite technologically "illiterate" and don't really understand what I do, despite my best efforts to try and explain.

So, anyways, he called me the other night because he just wanted to  say hi but it's so painful for me, because we have the most unnatural and forced conversations. It doesn't help that I have nothing to talk about. My life equates to going to work, playing video games / surfing the internet, and then go to bed and repeat. His is basically go to work, do whatever needs to be done around the house, and sleep. Frankly, I don't think either of us are particularly happy people.

Sorry this was such a massive wall of text, I didn't really know how to sum up my dad's life and my life in short. It's just that my family has basically disowned my brother and I'm all they have, and it pains me that he and I barely even have that... But I have absolutely no idea how to change? I've really never been good with people in general. Have always had trouble making friends and talking to people in life.


**tl;dr** My father and I both lead dull, boring lives and have never been close. I have no idea who he is as a person and don't know how to connect with him. After moving far from home for work I want to improve this, but don't know how. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been single for about 2 years now, and have had minimal luck with dating sites. I think my standards are too high, and I don't know if that's "wrong" of me or not.

What do you guys look for?

For me, the big things are:

* No kid
* Doesn't smoke (I guess I'd be ok with pot in small amounts)
* In college or working something other than retail
* Nonreligious

As I grow older, it's hard to find someone who doesn't have a kid it seems like. I'm awful with kids though, and I don't really know if I want them myself. The third and forth ones I debate whether or not I should be more lenient here because I don't even know what I want from a woman. If I want kids, I sort of like the idea of a stay-at-home mom... But on the other hand, I want someone career oriented so I'm not the only one bringing in money. It seems like every on OKC/POF wants to be a hair stylist or something and for some reason that's just  a turn off for me. I know it's judgemental but I assume they're just some superficial ditzy bimbo. As far as religion goes, I'm (obviously) not religious and I certainly couldn't date someone who is very religious but I don't know about the people who believe in God but don't go to church and won't get upset over trivial things.

Part of me feels guilty over 3 and 4, but then I also think to myself that if I'm looking to spend a significant amount of time and energy with someone, it should be someone I truly want to be with, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is kind of a weird post, but I don't really know where else to go. All my life I've struggled with motivation, the bare minimum has been enough to get by. Whatever grade I got in school was always "Good enough" for me, so long as I passed. I know I'm smart, I know I have potential but I just don't care. I'm so overwhelmingly apathetic in absolutely everything in my life.

Lately, I've been working from home almost every day of the week "because of the bad weather", but really that's just an excuse because I'm so fucking depressed I don't ever want to leave my room. I use the term working loosely, as this is the real problem; I barely get anything done at all and am falling behind on my work quite a bit. I know it's a problem, but I just can't motivate myself to do anything. The only reason I'm even awake at this hour of the night is because I'm so stressed out on this project I can't sleep. I'm afraid I could lose my job as I'm a contractor, yet here I am poking around on Reddit instead of doing something about it.

I know I need professional help but I can't get health insurance for *at least* a month to do anything about it. I don't know. I'm just sick and tired of wishing I'd die in some freak accident, starting to feel like I need to do better, I deserve better, but I just can't... What the fuck can I do? I just want to get on with my life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently moved here and I've been struggling to find a good, proper breakfast diner. I don't Denny's, I don't want Ihop. I tried The Original Pancake House, or whatever it's called, last week and was thoroughly disappointed. The food wasn't bad, but it was insanely expensive. $5 for 4 slices of bacon? C'mon.

Back home, we had this restaurant called [Carl's Diner](https://www.google.com/search?q=carl%27s+diner+oxford safe=off espv=210 es_sm=93 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=S4gcU-PAL6y6yAGwtoHICw ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg biw=1680 bih=959) and that is the amount of food you'd get. The portions were huge, everything was greasy and disgusting and **delicious**. Your meal came with hashbrowns. Your side came with a side of hashbrowns. It was so much food for the price.

It was kind of a mom-and-pop atmosphere, even though the owner was never physically there. But it was a small staff that knew everyone (I guess this is just the nature of a tiny town though) but man I miss it. This isn't necessarily "crucial" to what I'm looking for, but I find its these kinds of places that are more generous with food.

Anyone know of a place like this? I live right near the Target / Best Buy plaza on the Boulevard so the closer to there the better :)

	<TEXT> Hey guys, I just started playing D3 again to try out 2.0 and see if I wanted Reaper of Souls. 

Anyways, here's [my Barbarian](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/StakOverfl%C3%B6-1324/hero/739). It's not great, but my gear was complete shit before I quit.

I'm trying out this HP Regen / Lifesteal WW build. Currently, I regen 3,890 HP/S + 512 per Rend target and then 1024 HP per Crit of Whirlwind.

It seems to be going fairly well, I'm comfortable in Torment 2 but I don't stand a chance in Torment 3.

I think I want to swap out Grim Harvest for a more useful skill but I don't know what. I'm thinking Wrath of the Berserker with either Insanity (+50% Damage) or Thrive on Chaos (another +826 Life per Fury Spent) while I blender mans.

I know I drastically need more Crit chance for WW, but other than I'm not really sure how to improve this character other than hoping to get more Life on Hit and more Damage. Is attack speed at all important for a WW-oriented build?

	<TEXT> I grew up a giant nerd, happy to stay in and play video games 'til my fingers would fall off, but more and more I find myself bored and frustrated with games. I *want* to enjoy them but I just don't have fun 9/10 times anymore.

With this severe winter we're having I find myself with some pretty serious cabin fever; I work from home most days and then spend all my time off at home still. Going insane with nothing to do, and I just moved to a new city where I only have 1 friend so if he doesn't feel like going out I have no one to talk to or do things with.

So I guess I'm just looking for new hobbies-- what do you do and what do you enjoy about it, men of reddit? </TEXT>

I don't know much at all about jewelry, but I've decided I want a ring. I've been scouring the internet for something like the one I linked above, except with the gold on the "outside" and an inner band of black tungsten.

I've seen a lot with either silver, white gold, or just steel on the outter parts but I don't think that's what I want.

Any advice for a total jewelry noob? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never been the jewelry type what so ever, but lately I've been really wanting to get a nice ring as I get older. Something simple, though.

I found this from Kay's:

Basically I'm looking a nice onyx band with 2 thin strips of gold around it... Can't seem to find anything free of tacky tribal engravings on the band or anything.

I don't really care if it's fake, so long as it looks good. Was hoping someone here might be able to point me in the right direction for a total jewelry-noob. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a big City Builder kind of guy, but I decided to pick this game up on a whim. It's been pretty fun and I really don't have any complaints (aside from the lack of native Borderless Window) and while I've logged about 10 hours in a short amount of time (for me) I don't necessarily feel *compelled* to play it.

I was just wondering if someone could explain why they think the game is so great? The last city builder I played was Sim City, which was just abysmal. So coming from that to this, I'm wondering if other people got burned and are just happy to have something actually functional, or if I'm just missing something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I already filed (and got my returns) my taxes for 2013, then recently went to visit friends back in my home state. I found out a previous employer sent a W2 to my old address and my roommates never told me.

It says for 2013 I earned $1800, which is impossible because I worked there from 12/11 - 05/12. It was a small company, so I emailed my old boss earlier last week and he said he'd look in to it. Hasn't gotten back to me after I sent a followup email. I plan to call tomorrow and see if I can talk with their bookkeeper / accountant directly. If that proves fruitless, what should I do? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Tax return season! Looking to get new wheels, but I don't know how to find tires that will fit?

I'm looking at these: http://www.conceptzperformance.com/Cart/description.php?II=4349 Car_Type=350Z UID=2014021808453376.180.32.126

19x9.5 in the front, 19x10.5 in the rear. But then any tire site has you enter your vehicle, or tire size... But I don't know what size would fit those wheels. Is it just a matter of converting from inch to mm for the width?

I know TireRack has wheel and tire combos, I suppose if I just find some wheels that are the same size then any matching tire should work for the Varrstoen right? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What debt do I pay off first? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-17 15:07:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Quick run down of my debts:

* $5,604.84 @ **8%** (Private student loan #1)
* $5,730.95 (unsure of percent) (Private student loan #2)
* $10,014.96 (unsure of percent) (Private student loan in mother's name)
* $10,864.62 @ **9%** (auto loan)
* $24,559.35 ranging from **3.4% - 6.8%** (Federal student loans)

The $24.5K in Federal loans is an assortment of 10 smaller loans averaging about $2K each.

The car loan is $270/mo but I pay an extra $150 towards the premium. 

I've got about another $18K in student loans, so combined they work out to about $1K/mo (can't log in to the website to get the actual balance).

I make $1001 per week.

At the end of this month I should have about $5.7K or so in the bank.

I was hoping someone could provide some insight as to which debt I should pay down first, or what to do with my money.

* On one hand, I want to pay off my car, since it's the highest interest rate and if I need to sell it in a pinch for whatever reason that money will go to me rather than the bank
* On the other hand, I just want to chip away at as much of this $65K in student debt as possible, since to my understanding you cannot be absolved from student debt even if you go bankrupt.
* On the other other hand, perhaps I should invest? As Tesla breaks $200 last week I'm kicking myself in the ass for not buying as much of it as I could when I wanted to at $50/share last year.
* Forth, put a chunk into my IRA. I'm a contract worker and get 0 benefits, so I haven't made a contribution to my retirement in a while.
* Final option is to simply sit on the money. Play it safe, hold on to it as a rainy-day-fund in case my contract doesn't get extended (the IT job market in this city is pretty shit if I were to become unemployed). </TEXT>

Just bubble wrap + tape and throw them in my carry-on? I'm afraid TSA would be like "Uh. The fuck is this?". Or I could just bring a small bag for my checked luggage, but those will undoubtedly get thrown around and everything will be in a million pieces by the time I get it back. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Despite being a tech enthusiast, I jumped on the smart phone wagon pretty late. I've had my Galaxy Nexus for a little over a year and a half now, and it's physically deteriorating so I just ordered a 32 GB Nexus 5 from Google.

I use Straight Talk as my provider,  I was just wondering if I'll need to do anything but pop the SIM card out of my GNex and put it into the 5?

What's the best way to transfer pictures / apps over?

edit; 10 AM EST, Google says it'll "Leave the warehouse by the 7th" and I paid for Overnight shipping so it'd presumably arrive on Monday.... I had it shipped to my parents house in a different state since I'll be visiting this weekend-- think it'll ship before the 7th? I don't want to pay for them to overnight it to me if it arrives after I leave :( </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-02-03 21:04:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I've never planted anything before but I kind of want something green to hopefully freshen up my bedroom. I've got a decent sized window about 30"x48". It gets a decent amount of sunlight, generally from noon and on the sun is in my window.

I was just wondering what's something I could get that requires very little maintenance, aside from being watered? I don't really like the look of cacti so that's probably out.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)
