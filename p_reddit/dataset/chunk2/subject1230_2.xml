	<TEXT> The newly provided transcripts denigrate minority suspects with racial slurs and insult colleagues perceived to be gay. The texts ridicule blacks in Ferguson, Missouri, where police shot and killed an unarmed black man.

They discuss a shootout among black men and the shooting of an armed suspect by police. In doing so, they appear to ridicule the shooting death by police in 2014 of a mentally ill man carrying a stun gun officers mistook for a handgun.

They also exchanged photographs with racist captions.

One photo depicts a white man playfully spraying a young black child with a garden hose. The caption calls the boy a racial slur.

There's a photo of smoke rising above San Francisco and guesses are exchanged about the origins of the fire.

"Must be Korean BBQ," quips one.

"I heard was a slave ship!!" quips another. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With great financial freedom comes great financial responsibility.

While I hope things become more user-friendly, there were several mess-ups here:

* Private keys to a significant amount of coin on an online device, rather than a dedicated offline device (it's not 'cold' if it's ever touched the internet).

* Weak password

* Even if if the password wasn't weak, a key logger could capture the password if/when you type it in, so again, an online device is not secure.

I'm genuinely sorry for your loss. Again, while I wish cryptocurrency was more user-friendly, sometimes a lesson has to be learned the hard way. </TEXT>

Two objects namely one uncircumcised penis, and one other penis gently come together into a tip to tip union. once touching, the uncircumcised male then proceeds to encapsulate the other mans shaft creating a perfect vacuum seal.

	<TEXT> Canadian rocker Bryan Adams is canceling a performance this week in Mississippi, citing the state's new law that allows religious groups and some private businesses to refuse service to gay couples.

Adams said in a statement Sunday night that he was canceling a show Thursday at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi.

The singer says he can't "in good conscience" perform in a state where "certain people are being denied their civil rights due to their sexual orientation."

The move comes after [Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band canceled a Sunday show in Greensboro, North Carolina](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bruce-springsteen-cancels-north-carolina-concert/), because of that state's new law blocking anti-discrimination rules for the LGBT community. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand what you're saying as a Democrat.

I think there are a large number of voters, including myself, who do not identify with either party, and frankly, are disgusted by both and feel that neither represent their interests.

Hence the popularity of less mainstream politicians like Sanders and Trump.

	<TEXT> Thank you for pointing this out.

Please consider reporting it at http://www.cnn.com/feedback/

I made a template for anyone that wishes to use it:

INCORRECT INFORMATION: Wisconsin primary: 5 things to watch (http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/politics/election-results-what-to-watch/)

The following is partially incorrect:

"In a memo posted on Medium Monday evening, Mook wrote: "Sanders has to win the four remaining delegate-rich primaries -- New York, Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey -- with roughly 60% of the vote. To put that in perspective: Sanders has thus far won only two primaries with that margin: Vermont and New Hampshire.""

Sanders has won the following states with that margin:

-New Hampshire

-Minnesota

-Vermont

-Kansas

-Maine

-Idaho

-Utah

-Alaska

-Washington

-Hawaii

EDIT: Upon further review, Idaho and Utah (and Vermont and New Hampshire) are the only states there that are actually primaries. So, still technically incorrect, but not *as* incorrect as I initially thought. </TEXT>

IMHO, "we have a higher standard of living now than we have ever had in history" would be more accurate than saying "more fair".

Anyway, here ya go:

**Summary**

* Tesla revealed the Model 3 and started taking reservations.

* The number of reservations were vastly beyond the expectations of even the most optimistic estimates.

* This puts the rest of the luxury auto industry in a difficult spot.

* I look at sales numbers of the competitors vs. reservations for the Model 3.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) revealed the Model 3. I placed the order for mine online the second reservations opened up. I was one of 115,000 people to place an order for the car sight unseen. The car was revealed about an hour after I placed my order and saying that it did not disappoint is an understatement.

Tesla Model 3

With Autopilot safety features and supercharging standard, $35,000 starting price, trunk and a frunk and an expected five-star safety rating in all categories, this will be the most compelling car in its segment.

Here is the gas car competition:
		

The pictures show the BMW (OTCPK:BAMXF) 3 Series, Mercedes (OTCPK:DDAIF) C Class and Audi (OTCPK:VLKAY) A4.

Here is the supposed EV Competition - GM's (NYSE:GM) Chevy Bolt. I say supposed because the car is in a different size/class segment.

The similarities end at it being another long-range EV.

None of the competition has the autopilot safety features standard. As an example, to get the equivalent safety features on a BMW you would need to pay an extra $5,400 ($1,700 for their driver assist package which forces other packages on you). Mercedes will charge you at least $3,350 for the features. You are forced to get something more comparable (but in in my opinion still inferior) to the Tesla autopilot to get even the safety features.

None of the competition even has OTA updates. Also the competition has very dated looking interiors compared to the Model 3 Dash:

Source: IBTimes

Historically Tesla has stayed very close to their concept dashboards and I expect the Model 3 to follow suit.

During the Model 3 reveal event, video here, Tesla had a live reservation counter and by 9:30 Pacific time had more than 128,000 reservations. By this afternoon, reservations had climbed to 198,000. Just for comparison, over the first two days the original Apple iPhone sold 270,000 units. So 200,000 reservations for a $35,000 car to be delivered two years from now or more is an impressive feat by any measure.

Here are the US sales for some of the competition in 2015:

* BMW 3 Series 	94,527

* Mercedes C Class 	86,080

* Acura TLX 	47,080

* Audi A4 	31,577

* Total Small Luxury 	611,973

Source: GoodCarBadCar

My estimates for lines at US Tesla stores are an average of 500 based on pictures, enthusiast forum posts and local news coverage of lines at Tesla locations nationwide. Tesla has over 100 locations in the US and I estimate more than 50,000 of the initial 115,000 came from the US. I expect Tesla to have more reservations over the next few months from the US than the annual sales of all the competition. Here is a picture of a line of people waiting in the rain to reserve a Model 3.

In January, even before Tesla mentioned this in their Q4 2015 shareholder letter, I wrote about how Model S is taking away serious market share from the competition. I expect the Model 3 to be no different. The sales of the Model 3 will easily surpass all the competition. A few days ago even Audi admitted that Tesla has done everything right. Let's assume reservations slow down and they just double from the current number by the time the Model 3 launches. And let's say that Tesla takes two years to deliver these 400,000 orders. That's an average rate of 200,000/year in 2018 and 2019. And if this is split 50/50 US/International, we have 100,000/year in the US, which represents a 16% market share of the small luxury sedan market. Bigger than any of the competitors and essentially a repeat of the Model S success.

While the first competition for the Model S - the Porsche (OTCPK:POAHF) Mission E - is at least five years away, I expect the first real competition for the Model 3 is at least a decade away. As much as some like to point to the Bolt or upcoming Leaf 2 as Model 3 competitors, they are not in the same segment at all. In fact, unless the Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) Leaf 2 is exactly like the Nissan IDS Prototype, Nissan has no hope of selling even a fraction of the Model 3 numbers and I say this as a Leaf driver.

I'm not sure what time is considered end of quarter for Tesla (midnight Pacific or midnight Eastern). Assuming midnight Eastern, the Model 3 reservations will have added at least $120 million to Tesla's customer deposits. Tesla customer deposits stood at over $280 million last quarter and that included Signature Model X deposits of over $40,000 each. It is an impressive feat to have a car with only a $1,000 deposit to add a $120 million to the customer deposits.

Just yesterday I had my first Model X sighting and I now await Tesla Q1 results which should point to Model X production going smoothly in addition to the fantastic reception of the Model 3. As more Model Xs hit the road, the rest of the year should be great for Tesla and Tesla stock.

Of course, the Model 3 represents new challenges for Tesla like the completion of the Gigafactory and an order of magnitude of larger volumes than its previous cars. This could lead to delays like we are used to with Tesla. And maybe Model 3 customers will not be as tolerant as previous early adopters. But on the other hand, in the opinion of many (me included), there is just no comparison with anything else. So the likelihood is that people will wait.

In conclusion:

*  The Model 3 exceeded the expectations of both reservation number and standard feature wise.

*  The reception was overwhelmingly positive.

* Tesla is likely to receive US deposits for more than any of the competitions annual sales and I expect Tesla to take market share from all of them as soon as deliveries start.

* Q1 results should point to a great year ahead.

* I look at sales numbers of the competitors vs. reservations for the Model 3.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) revealed the Model 3. I placed the order for mine online the second reservations opened up. I was one of 115,000 people to place an order for the car sight unseen. The car was revealed about an hour after I placed my order and saying that it did not disappoint is an understatement.

Tesla Model 3

With Autopilot safety features and supercharging standard, $35,000 starting price, trunk and a frunk and an expected five-star safety rating in all categories, this will be the most compelling car in its segment.

Here is the gas car competition:
		

The pictures show the BMW (OTCPK:BAMXF) 3 Series, Mercedes (OTCPK:DDAIF) C Class and Audi (OTCPK:VLKAY) A4.

Here is the supposed EV Competition - GM's (NYSE:GM) Chevy Bolt. I say supposed because the car is in a different size/class segment.

The similarities end at it being another long-range EV.

None of the competition has the autopilot safety features standard. As an example, to get the equivalent safety features on a BMW you would need to pay an extra $5,400 ($1,700 for their driver assist package which forces other packages on you). Mercedes will charge you at least $3,350 for the features. You are forced to get something more comparable (but in in my opinion still inferior) to the Tesla autopilot to get even the safety features.

None of the competition even has OTA updates. Also the competition has very dated looking interiors compared to the Model 3 Dash:

Historically Tesla has stayed very close to their concept dashboards and I expect the Model 3 to follow suit.

During the Model 3 reveal event, video here, Tesla had a live reservation counter and by 9:30 Pacific time had more than 128,000 reservations. By this afternoon, reservations had climbed to 198,000. Just for comparison, over the first two days the original Apple iPhone sold 270,000 units. So 200,000 reservations for a $35,000 car to be delivered two years from now or more is an impressive feat by any measure.

Here are the US sales for some of the competition in 2015:

* BMW 3 Series 	94,527

* Mercedes C Class 	86,080

* Acura TLX 	47,080

* Audi A4 	31,577

* Total Small Luxury 	611,973

Source: GoodCarBadCar

My estimates for lines at US Tesla stores are an average of 500 based on pictures, enthusiast forum posts and local news coverage of lines at Tesla locations nationwide. Tesla has over 100 locations in the US and I estimate more than 50,000 of the initial 115,000 came from the US. I expect Tesla to have more reservations over the next few months from the US than the annual sales of all the competition. Here is a picture of a line of people waiting in the rain to reserve a Model 3.

In January, even before Tesla mentioned this in their Q4 2015 shareholder letter, I wrote about how Model S is taking away serious market share from the competition. I expect the Model 3 to be no different. The sales of the Model 3 will easily surpass all the competition. A few days ago even Audi admitted that Tesla has done everything right. Let's assume reservations slow down and they just double from the current number by the time the Model 3 launches. And let's say that Tesla takes two years to deliver these 400,000 orders. That's an average rate of 200,000/year in 2018 and 2019. And if this is split 50/50 US/International, we have 100,000/year in the US, which represents a 16% market share of the small luxury sedan market. Bigger than any of the competitors and essentially a repeat of the Model S success.

While the first competition for the Model S - the Porsche (OTCPK:POAHF) Mission E - is at least five years away, I expect the first real competition for the Model 3 is at least a decade away. As much as some like to point to the Bolt or upcoming Leaf 2 as Model 3 competitors, they are not in the same segment at all. In fact, unless the Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) Leaf 2 is exactly like the Nissan IDS Prototype, Nissan has no hope of selling even a fraction of the Model 3 numbers and I say this as a Leaf driver.

I'm not sure what time is considered end of quarter for Tesla (midnight Pacific or midnight Eastern). Assuming midnight Eastern, the Model 3 reservations will have added at least $120 million to Tesla's customer deposits. Tesla customer deposits stood at over $280 million last quarter and that included Signature Model X deposits of over $40,000 each. It is an impressive feat to have a car with only a $1,000 deposit to add a $120 million to the customer deposits.

Just yesterday I had my first Model X sighting and I now await Tesla Q1 results which should point to Model X production going smoothly in addition to the fantastic reception of the Model 3. As more Model Xs hit the road, the rest of the year should be great for Tesla and Tesla stock.

Of course, the Model 3 represents new challenges for Tesla like the completion of the Gigafactory and an order of magnitude of larger volumes than its previous cars. This could lead to delays like we are used to with Tesla. And maybe Model 3 customers will not be as tolerant as previous early adopters. But on the other hand, in the opinion of many (me included), there is just no comparison with anything else. So the likelihood is that people will wait.

In conclusion:

*  The Model 3 exceeded the expectations of both reservation number and standard feature wise.

*  The reception was overwhelmingly positive.

* Tesla is likely to receive US deposits for more than any of the competitions annual sales and I expect Tesla to take market share from all of them as soon as deliveries start.

* Q1 results should point to a great year ahead.

	<TEXT> **USMNT players make pointed jokes about Abby Wambachs DUI arrest**

**By Des Bieler**

Alejandro Bedoya, left, and Jozy Altidore, right, are shown in 2013 with one of the USMNTs dual-nationality players, Aron Johannsson. (Hans Punz/Associated Press)

It is not surprising that Abby Wambach is taking some heat for her DUI arrest early Sunday morning. However, it is more than a little eye-opening that some of that heat is emanating from the U.S. mens national team.

However, Wambach, who retired from the womens national team last year after a highly decorated career, could be said to have started it, with comments in December criticizing USMNT Coach Jurgen Klinsmanns extensive use of foreign guys, i.e., players with dual nationalities. That provides the context for this pointed tweet from midfielder Alejandro Bedoya, who has made many appearances with the USMNT.

[Mix Diskerud slams Wambachs comments on dual-citizenship U.S. players]

That tweet was replied to by USMNT forward Jozy Altidore, who took the opportunity to also take a shot at USWNT goalie Hope Solo. Her husband, former NFL player Jerramy Stevens, was arrested for DUI last year, and he and Solo were reportedly driving around in an official U.S. Soccer team van at the time.

Bedoya and Altidore were born in New Jersey, but both are the children of foreign-born parents and thus could have some particular empathy for dual-nationality USMNT players such as Mix Diskerud, Fabian Johnson and Julian Green. However, they might have been expected to show some deference to a U.S. soccer star, particularly at such a painful time for Wambach.

There is another dynamic at play here, though, and that is the federal complaint of wage discrimination recently filed by several USWNT members, including Solo. While aimed at the U.S. Soccer Federation, the players complaint is necessarily based on directly comparing the success of the USWNT on the field and off, including television ratings, to its male counterpart.

Meanwhile, Bedoya wasnt done with his online comments. After taking his own heat from Twitter users who though he was way out of line for jabbing at Wambach, the 28-year-old, who plays for French team FC Nantes, fired off a few more posts.
0wambachC0403

The hashtag, #1N1T, that Bedoya used stands for One Nation, One Team, a social-media campaign that U.S. Soccer began as the USMNT prepared to compete for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It has since been applied to the USWNT, as well, but it doesnt feel like the two national squads are feeling any particular unity at the moment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been a while since I've actually used Electrum, but if I remember correctly, once an address has been used, it's sorted into a collapsed 'Used' folder/tab so that you are encouraged to use new addresses.

But if you still want to reuse addresses, you should be able to uncollapse that folder/tab and see all your previously used addresses.

The previously used addresses will still recognize if more coins are sent to them, whether you or someone else sends coins there, and you should have full access to those coins.

Individual addresses should never be deleted, unless you've importing single unique addresses/keys that are not associated with a master seed, but that's a different topic and I'm probably just confusing you with extra information now. </TEXT>

One question...

 You can trade XRP on many exchanges but you're really trading XRP IOUs and don't hold the XRP in your own wallet (kraken, poloniex, bitstamp). Your XRP in an exchange is like like putting your XRP in a safe in a bank. Sure, you technically own it but you have to ask permission for it. The bank gives you an IOU which you can redeem for your funds.

But can I send XRP out of an exchange to a wallet like GateHub that I control? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just wondering if it would be worth my while to buy 1 BTC as an investment sort of thing.

Make your own investment decisions.

Also what on earth are faucets and how do they work?  Ive seen some sites seem to give away what i imagine are miniscule amounts but surely that can start to add up over time especially if the BTC price rises at all.

They're sites that give you insanely small amounts of coins. I haven't seen any non-super-shitty faucets in years. A lot of them will 'give' you some insanely small amount of coins for watching a video or solving a captcha, but then they don't let you withdraw unless you accumulate a much larger amount.

Even if you got coins from faucets all day, it would only add up to a few cents a day.

Maybe there's some good faucets out there, but in my experience they're mostly total crap.

If i did go on to buy some, is it easy to then sell them for USD?

Easy enough.

If you buy from places like Coinbase or Circle you should be able to sell back to them. There are other online services too.

You can also find people locally to sell to through sites like LocalBitcoins.com or Mycelium Local Trader. Or go to some Meetups or other places nerds gather and I'm sure you'll find people that want to buy them from you. </TEXT>

Subreddit mods can do it (or something very similar) on their specific subs as well, and then everybody shouts at you when you use the word 'shadowban' because 'shadowbanning' is only a Reddit-wide function.

The subreddit specific action sure seems like shadowbanning to me, but maybe there's a better word. </TEXT>

I'm not too familiar with breadwallet, but in general you can receive bitcoins from others at any time when you are offline (though you won't be able to see it until you get online), but you cannot send bitcoins when you are offline.

You can, however, create a sending transaction when you are offline and then broadcast it once you are online. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm of the opinion that any online system is not very secure.

But there's a couple things you can do:

* Put a strong password/encryption key on your wallet to prevent brute-force password guessing on your wallet
* Backup your wallet, either by making a digital copy or by physically writing down your seed words or private keys, to prevent loss
* Don't put more in a wallet than you're willing to lose

If you want real security, cold storage is the way to go, but you may want to save this until you get comfortable with Bitcoin.

 Which is safer/efficient?

As described above, IMO any online system is not very safe.

As far as efficiency, full wallets like Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Core are much more heavy duty than lightweight wallets like breadwallet, so I'd say breadwallet is more 'efficient' from a user-experience point of view. </TEXT>

The mod that deleted it cited [Rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/about/rules/) and then never responded when I asked for further explanation:

And this large and highly profitable diversion creek is largely controlled by violent members of organized crime groups that couldn't care less about the law. </TEXT>
