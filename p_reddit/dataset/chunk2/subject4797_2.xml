What superstars get the best, most enthusiastic introduction by the ring announcer or what ring announcer goes wild with announcing what superstar

I think its really just a contest to see how can draw out a superstars name the longest and i think Justin Roberts is winning with John Cena.

	<TEXT> Across the board what are some of the best named and worst named PPVs in sports entertainment? 

Don't limit yourself to the WWF/E. Think about TNA, WCW, ROH.

Obviously there was a time when PPV wasn't a thing but those's yearly titled shows from back in the day pre-ppv should still be included in this discussion

Obviously, I like Wrestlemania. I like it even better when they have the intro to DVD's an there is the audio of the guy, maybe Vince, maybe Fink that says "WELCOME TO WRESTLE..MANIA!"

TNA's Victory Road has a nice ring to it. Knowing little to noting about TNA is sounds like it could be the PPV that leads into Wrestlemania </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, I'm a mod of /r/YouShouldKnow  and thanks to some input and sugguestions from our community members we've deicede that the current flair, while it works, would work better in the same style has /r/randomactsofcards

What I'm trying to accomplish is to

1. Get rid of user applied post flair

    1a. I know how to stop users from being able to apply their own flair in the subreddit setting

2. Create a submit button for each of our categories (which are currently the flair choices

3. Upon clicking the Submit a Technology YSK the submission page will have the submission title prefilled with "[Category Tag] YSK ......."

4. Have AutoModerator remove posts that do not begin withi [Category Tag] YSK...

    4a. I will be able to write teh AutoModerator functions as i understand

What I don't have a strong grasp of is what CSS changes to be made. While I did the CSS of the subreddit, i haven't really followed up on creating my own personal website and doing codecademy lessons, i have kind of forgotten most of what i thought i knew.


I've attached a link to a conversation I had with a subscriber discussing the issues. What i'd really love is some sort of step by step instruction for creating the buttons, then implementing  submission box, etc..

Thanks </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't get what I'm doing wrong. I've tried doing pulled pork in the slow cooker 3 times and each time the meat is un-pull-able. Its just a tough mess. 

I've put liquid (water) in the slow cooker, i've done it without liquid. I don't have the first recipe I tried but maybe I cooked it for too many hours. 

I just coat the meat in dry spices and put it in on low but it is never tender, fall off the bone. It goes from raw to tough.

I've only used bone-in pork shoulder from the super market. Roughly 4.5 to 6.5lbs is the range i can get in the store.

Today, I tried this recipe

http://www.tasteofsouthern.com/pulled-pork-bbq-in-the-oven-recipe/

I followed it to the tee, save for putting on mustard, liquid smoke and worchestor sauce. Was that a mistake? 

Is there some sort of unspoken rule for making pulled pork that is assumed to be common knowledge and isn't put into recipes.

Its very frustrating and I can't figure out what to do and discouraging me from taking out my slow cooker again.

If you need any specific information go ahead and ask.

Thanks for the help :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> YSK that we need your help to make this subreddit even better. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-05 23:26:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I think this subreddit has gotten better in the past 6 months. That quality of posts has gone up and I think the number of bad posts has gone down, due in part to the community reporting posts and the implementation of AutoModerator, which removes posts based on certain pre-determined keywords as defined by the rules on the side bar.


I want to know what the community thinks of this subreddit.

What can be done to better improve the posts in this subreddit?

Should new rules be added to the subreddit?

Is the tagging flair system working for posts? 

I haven't figured out a way to remove posts that have no flair without going individually and doing that. Which is something I don't have the time to do. I think  70 to 80 percent of posts have flair which is good but i would want all of them to have it, very much in the same vein as /r/woahdude 

So, know-it-alls what are you ideas for the subreddit? Things to change, things to stay the same?

There's been little moderation in this subreddit because it doesn't seems its needed unless to remove bad posts and comments. Are there things you want the mods to facilitate in the subreddit, such as weekly/monthly discussions or things of that nature.

We are at 367k and change subscribers and I think we can grow even bigger just as LifeProTips has.

-------

I think some things for everybody to remember is to report posts that are bad. Report posts that are false, report posts that the community as whole deems bad. Such posts will then be removed and comments too. In some cases reporting is how we find out there is a user that is going to get banned since I don't click through the posts often, when somebody reports a comment or when we get a message from AutoModerate that a comment has been reported 5 times and we check it out and its a troll, then we ban that user or take action to remedy.

Also, what are your thoughts on the quality of the post, not just the YSK in the title. Are posters discussing their YSK or just posting and leaving. Do you want a body to the post that discusses the YSK?

Are YSKs about Reddit something you want here? I often just point people to FAQ about reddit or other reddits because I see this subreddit to not be about Reddit or facebook YSKs.

------------

That is all for now! Respond away with any ideas your have about this subreddit or about how /r/funny isn't funny. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-01-24 01:06:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, long story short last week i got a ~4lb bone in pork shoulder to make pulled pork for the first time. I followed the recipe 

http://civilizedcavemancooking.com/crockpot/crockpot-pulled-pork/

*4lb bone in shoulder

*Various spices

*1/4 water

*Onions on the bottom of the cooker

* Cook for 8 - 10 hours on low

Aside from changing some spices to my personal taste. My dilemma comes from the aftermath of the 8 hours. 

I took it out after 8 hours and to be honest, it had the consistency of pork chops (or at least to my mothers pork chops). I had to work to get it to pull apart and even then it didn't really pull.

I suppose it was tender to the fork but it wasnt fall off the bone tender

Is this because it was not cooked long enough or cooked too long?

Did it matter that it had the skin on one side which i left on when i put it in the cooker? Skin side up.

I've been trying to figure out what may have went awry but i cant really seem to find a general consensus as to how you should/could cook a bone in shoulder.

Now, today, i got a 4lb boneless pork shoulder and would like to try again this weekend. So, is there any advice you guys/girls may have or recipes that are more well written than the one i used? Ive searched the sub for anything similar to what i experience and i wasnt able to find anything </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think we as the subscribers/community of /r/YouShouldKnow should talk about what this subreddit is turning into. 

It seems that from reading the comments on many posts here that the quality has definitly decreased or at least the quantity has increased and thusly the number of low-quality posts have increased accordingly. This subreddit is no longer a small community IMO with over 300k subscribers we've grown quite large.

I've noticed in the past few weeks/months a growing number of posts in which a majority of the comments complain or discuss the post and how it should have been put into /r/todayilearned or elsewhere. I've also noticed a lack of regad for the 4 rules that are on the sidebar including posts that contain an agenda or call to arms, which i think is the most important one (aside from proper titling)

As a one who often vists and post in this subreddit I can only point out what i've seen and what i think should change. I personally speaking think we need better or more moderation. Perhaps moderators who don't mod the large Million+ subreddits. Moderators who can have some time to deal with what this subreddit is turning into, a low-quality TIL/YSK forum. Whether it be more or better rules or more/new moderators I cannot say for sure. I also think it would be nice to have some good CSS considering we are a lot like /r/LifeProTips, a community with good CSS and organization.

These a merely my ideas, what I would do if I had the powa. What are yours? Clearly there is are strong feelings toward the state of the subreddit (i think) so we should share them. </TEXT>

12 Years A Slave

I went in with preconcieved notions of what the film would be, what it would be like, what it wouldn't be like. I've heard people say it's like Schindler's List and I've heard people say Fassbender's slave owner makes Leo DiCaprio's (Django UnChained) look G-Rated. I've been told it's an "experience" and an "emotional rollercoaster." I've been told numerous things along the same lines but you get the gist, I'm sure you too have read reviews or other pieces about the film.

I would first like to say that the cinematography is fantastic. The use of the framing and camera movement or lack of movement was incredibly well done. As was the camera's relation to light in the film, the film was lit stunningly. Hans Zimmer's score was something that was both odd and out of place but perfect and right. It sounded and felt at times "Inception-esque" yet it fit the period of the film, it fit the setting of the story in an odd yet satisfying way. The acting overall was pretty good which from my view goes to say the directing was great too because in some scenes I wouldn't know what to say to the actor to ellict the preformance, emotions, look or feel that came out the preformances in 12 Years A Slave.

All that being said I felt there to be something missing. I was not on the edge of my seat, I was not crying nor was I caring. What is shocking that a slave owners wife threw a crystal alchoal bottle at a female slave's head? For some people in the theater yes it was, the gasps and flinching at certain moments such as this and various other instances of violence were and are expected. But I felt like the story was missing something, I didn't care about the character(s) at the end of the film. Is that something wrong with me or the film? Am I the heartless basterd who can't feel for these characters or did the film's story not do a good job to make me care. 

I went it wanting it to be fantastic. I went in under the assumption it would be a film festival and award show winning film. But I left the theater with a feeling of lacklusterness. The most recent films I've seen in theaters were Captain Phillips, Last Vegas and 12 Years A Slave in that order. I would go see Captain Phillips again over seeing any of the others for a second time. Although the first two i was emotionally invested in the characters, I and many other people in theater cried or nearly cried during Last Vegas. I was on the edge of my seat in Captain Phillips even though I knew full well what was going to happen. 12 Years A Slave did neither of that for me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> For Your Information: Breaking Bad   The Emmy Awards </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-16 23:32:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel that many of you are unaware of how the Emmy awards work. I will try and explain some of the more important rules and procedures for you.

1. The finale eight episodes of Breaking Bad are not eligible and therefore not going to win any Emmy awards this sunday at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards

This is because the eligibility window for these awards was June 1 2012 - May 31 2013. Which means that only the first half of season 5 is eligible for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. The second half or finale eight episode are eligible to be nominated for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards which will take place in 2014 NOT on sunday. 

2. Actors/Actresses who are nominated for Best Supporting/Lead are nominated for their show from one episode, not the entire season. When the network or production company submits their shows/episodes the actors are nominated for their preformance in one episode. 

Bryan Cranston in nominated for "Say My Name" the 7th episode of the 5th season. Jonathan Banks is also nominated for best supporting actor in a drama for the same episode and Aaron Paul for "Buyout" the 6th episode of the 5th season. Anna Gunn (supporting actress) is nominated for her performance in "Fifty-One" the 4th episode of the 5th season

2. Breaking Bad is nominated for best series but the voting was only on the first 8 episodes of season 5 because that is what is eligible for the Emmys. The Best Series Emmy takes into account all episodes of the submitted show's season.

3. The writing and directing Emmy's for drama and comedy shows (not including variety shows such as Colbert/Stewart/Fallon/Kimmel) is only for one episode. Which means any show including Breaking Bad can only one a writing or directing emmy for one show that was submitted for nomination. Breaking Bad has two different episodes nominated for best writing and one for best directing in a dram series.

Do keep this in mind that any Emmy Award Breaking Bad wins on Sunday has absolutely nothing to do with the finale 8 episodes that we have been watching over the past few weeks. The voting for the 65th Primetime Emmys occurred long before the finale eight were finished.

To repeat the finale 8 episodes of Breaking Bad including "Ozymandias" will be eligible for Emmy nominations in 2014 for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards.

	<DATE> 2013-08-25 03:01:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just found out about these earlier this month when i saw these large yellow lockers in one of my local 7/11s and they turn out to be Amazon Lockers. Which are lockers that you can have products, that are handled via Amazon and within certain dimension restrictions delivered to. I think that these are very useful for people who leave in urban areas where packages my be taken off your stoop. I'm currently in University City, Philadelphia and i can see this being a safe alternative for having items delivered to me should i choose.

Having read into the service here:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201117910

You put the address of the locker which you can look up the nearest one to you and it's shipped there. The downfalls i see are that if all the lockers are full the delivery person will try again the day after so one must relie on the promptness of people to pick up their packages in a timely manner.

You also are emailed the electronic password to the locker in which your package is placed once it has arrived at the locker and i assume that these passwords change but i'm not sure.


All in all, i think that this is a nice service and a fair alternative to the post office/p.o. box if your post offices are further away or something.

/u/Ulaer 

Yes, but its a little bit trickier. Launch Netflix and then wait a second or so. Then using the left stick on your Xbox controller click up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, up, up, up, up. This may take a few tries to get it right. If you mess up just wait a second then try again. If performed correctly, it should open a menu showing some of the things mentioned above as well as a "Log out" option. 
 /u/familydoubledare pointed out that you can use the D-pad for making this procedure easier.


/u/growlingbear

Its select on PS3 


/u/sudosudont

The Netflix movie player (Silverlight desktop version) has the following keyboard shortcuts:

Space  Toggle Play/Pause

Enter  Toggle Play/Pause

PgUp  Play

PgDn  Pause

F  Full-screen

Esc  Exit full-screen

Shift+Left arrow  Rewind

Shift+Right arrow  Fast Forward

Up arrow - Volume Up

M  Mute toggle

**In full-screen mode:**

Ctrl+space  Frame forward/backward mode. 

Ctrl+space pauses the movie and enters key frame mode (aka intra-frame or i-frame mode). The right and left arrow keys then move between key frames.

The following 

Ctrl+Shift+Alt+* shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+Option+* in Mac OS X)  toggle information displays on/off when the player is NOT in full-screen mode. The displays will remain on, however, if full-screen mode is activated.

Ctrl+Shift+Alt+M  Menu;  includes loading custom .dfxp sub-title files.

	<TITLE> YSK That not all plungers are created equal and that there are different plungers for different drains. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-30 19:51:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Did you know that there are different plungers?

You probably did because you've walked through your local super-market or chain box store.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/kTgCblp.jpg) and [This](http://i.imgur.com/1U7wWeh.jpg) are **Cup Plungers** and are designed to unclog sink and bathtub drains. These are also the classic or original plunger designs and can be used for toliet bowls but are more suited for sinks/bathtubs because **your toilet bowl drain is curved** The bottom of these plungers is flat so it is more difficult to form a seal with the bowl

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/YQOdQGB.jpg) you can see the differences between a sink plunger (on the left) and a toilet plunger (on the right). Toilet plungers are also known as **flange plungers.** 

This more modern design is better for toliet bowl uncloggin because of it's curved shape it is significantly easier to get a seal between plunger and bowl and with the increase in size you trap a large volume of air in the seal which makes for a more powerful plunge.

You should also remember that as with anything price matters. Cheap plungers will not preform as good and for as long as ones that cost a more. 

Additionally you should have a cup plunger and flange plunger just because of the specific uses but also because you shouldn't be using a toilet plunger in the sink because of sanitation issues. 

------------------

Here are some steps for how to plunge a toilet properly. 

Place the plunger in the bowl so that it forms a seal.

Push down slowly until the cup of the plunger is completely compressed.
(WARNING: This is where people cause damage to their toilets! If you push down too hard, you will push the water through the wax seal between your toilet and the floor, and then you will have to call a plumber.)

With a quick jerk, pull the plunger back.

Repeat until the toilet drains.

So youre wondering why on earth would you want to pull the clog back up? Youre trying to send it down the drain, right? No, actually. Youre trying to dislodge the clog. It got stuck on its way down. You need to back it up so it can try to go down a different way. Thats what the quick backwards motion does: it rocks the clog back and forth, just like a car thats stuck in the snow, until it can move forward.


--------------------

Hope this helps, its my first YSK tip :) Cheers </TEXT>
