	<TEXT> Yeah but why? Honestly I am 100% sure that most if not all of these immigrants would come in legally if they were able. The wait to enter this country for people without a lot of money has become ridiculously long. Either we fix this or expect illegal immigrants. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was founded on Immigration! Doesn't matter legal or illegal. The only reason illegal immigration is happening is because our entire immigration system right now is broken and completely money based. Our country was founded off of bringing in the weak and the poor but now we neglect the poor in favor of profits. This is why our country is failing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SSA reported this income. They are not scamming anyone. If you don't give someone a legitimate way for them to pay how do you expect them to pay? 

Immigrants entering our country is what the country was founded on. I know you expect them to enter legally but our immigration system right now is beyond broken. 

Having low skill labor with anything but low wages just leads to automation. So basically you have to choose between low labor wage or no labor wage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cause it wouldn't need to be nearly as expensive. I don't think the issue was that people didn't think they needed it, everyone gets sick. Everyone will eventually need a doctor for checkups and simple stuff, but people saw how expensive it was and decided that they didn't need it enough to pay that much. With a healthier population health care costs should go down across the board allowing for competition between providers for the lowest sign up cost and therefore the most clients. As the price goes down more people will sign up and the entire system will become more profitable. This granted a high population of healthy individuals vs. Sick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, we would require them to cover high risk individuals just as they are now. There will always be high risk individuals but there will be enough healthy individuals to balance out the pools to make the insurance companies still profitable. The reason why were seeing such an unstable market right now is because when this bill was drawn up they made an estimate of how many high risk indivuals would be signing up. Turns out they drastically underestimated how many high risk individuals there were in the U.S which inevitably made the system much less profitable for insurance companies than predicted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do you think they are impossible to quantify? The $12b number was taken straight from the Social Security Administration.  Income taxes are most likely not paid but once again that is our fault not theirs. You absolutely can not assume employers are not paying payroll taxes. The numbers might not be 100% correct but they would get caught so fast not paying payroll taxes.

You would NOT hand out green cards at the border. You would first allow all illegal immigrants currently living in the U.S to apply for a green card. Then you offer an expedited green card system to any people that would like to immigrate into the U.S purely for working purposes. After this you can start to crack down on immigrants who refuse to adapt to this system. It would be incentive for millions to enter through an actual system rather than just coming over. You cant stop people from moving to where they want but you can make a system so that you can actually track who is entering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like i said before in 2013 they paid $12b in local and state taxes. But you're missing the point. You're complaint is that they do not pay taxes, they keep wages low, and they crowd social services. My point is that they do contribute to taxes and the only reason they do not pay more is because it is impossible/very dangerous for their us status to file taxes. Most of the jobs they do take from U.S citizens are very labor intensive low paying jobs, most of which would have already been automated was it not for the low wage option. And ofcourse they crowd social services. Name one low wage community that doesn't. But honestly the U.S is missing out on a real opportunity. Imagine we allow these people to stay here and give them green cards. Now you have an entire new community to tax (Maybe we can reduce some of that $600b deficit) along with a work force for the low wage labor intensive jobs and honestly less strain on social services since they will now have access to insurance, and immigrants are less likely to visit a doctor than nation born citizens anyway. It honestly sounds like a win-win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is illegal immigrants do pay taxes! All illegal immigrants pay sales tax, and in 2013 about 50% of illegal immigrants paid sales taxes, excise taxes, property taxes and personal income taxes. Accounting for $12b in State and Local taxes! I'm sure if wern't afraid of deportation some would of even filed federal taxes. It is not their fault they are not paying taxes, it is ours. They are absolutely necessary for some American businesses. No intelligent business man would hire illegals if they could afford to hire Americans like really the risks alone not even considering the increase in quality of work is enough to veer you away if there are other choices.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why? Its not like illegal immigrants are taking jobs at fortune 500 companies. Illegal immigrants are taking jobs in construction, agriculture, service, and manufacturing. Mostly sectors that are labor intensive and have a small profit margin. If it weren't for illegal workers we would of seen many more businesses in these sectors close than we already have. America has been founded off of cheap labor and honestly many American business would not survive without it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They may not pay federal taxes but all illegal immigrants still do pay sales taxes and it was found that about half of illegal immigrants actually pay sales   excise taxes along with property taxes and personal income taxes. In 2013 illegal immigrants ended up paying $12b in local   state taxes.(Effectively 8% of their income) They do inevitably crowd social services but imagine our tax revenue increase if 100% these people were granted citizenship and were paying full taxes. We might even be able to cover part of our $600b yearly deficit.   </TEXT>
