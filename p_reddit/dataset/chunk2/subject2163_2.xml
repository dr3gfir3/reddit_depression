	<TEXT> None taken. New to Reddit. I have been seeing a lot of people bashing their customer service, which surprised me. I don't post much on here but the way they handled my situation was great, so I felt like I should share. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So recently I posted in this subreddit that my chair was having problems with the lift piston. I got an immediate response from an employee of DXRacer giving me the email I needed to contact for the warranty (also I didn't even by this chair directly from dxracer). After sending the pictures of the defect that they needed they shipped me a new piston assembly immediately. Upon receiving the new piston I couldn't remove the old one from the wheel base. So I emailed them again and without any questions they sent out a new wheel base immediately! DXRacer gave me one of the best customer experiences I've ever had! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually ordered my chair from the same distributor. I contacted DxRacer first and they referred me to echoshen88@hotmail.com who handles all the 3rd party stuff. My lift piston slipped low into the wheel base and needed to be replaced. I just had to send in my name, order number and pictures of my lift piston and they shipped one out to me the same day free of charge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here's a picture](http://imgur.com/l7ccIZc) It's not dragging too bad but I feel like it shouldn't drag at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had my chair for about 6-7 months and I feel like the lift piston is slipping deeper into the wheel base and dragging on my carpet when I move the chair. Has anyone experienced this problem or am I just seeing things? </TEXT>
