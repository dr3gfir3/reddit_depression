	<TEXT> This couldn't be any more relevant. I dated a girl for a year and a half and I was so in love with her but we broke up last week because of the exact same reason as you. I'm incredibly heart broken but through the support of God and my friends I know I'll get through this and come out a better and stronger person. Praying for you friend stay strong. </TEXT>
