	<TEXT> Yeah these were all my first attempts at planets. One thing I will say is that with a dobsonian setup like mine it is much better for visual observations but it is hard to resist to try to capture them. For instance, visually they all showed much better detail with surface features on mars, Jupiter's great red spot was much more defined and Saturn's rings in more detail and also five moons. So dont get too discouraged by these. But if you are looking to mainly take pictures I would go with an SCT or catodiopteric. The problems with the dobsonian are that I need to use a barlow lens which blows your resolution and its not gear drivin so I cant track the movement of the sky so no deep sky photos. Although visually galaxies, comets, and nebulae are all easily achievable. I hope that helps. Happy observing! </TEXT>
