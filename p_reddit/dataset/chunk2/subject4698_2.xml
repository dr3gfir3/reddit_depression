	<TITLE> Why I Think The Witcher 3 Is The Best Game Ever Made </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-06 02:27:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I sail across the warm waters of Skellige, departed from an old fishing village off the north coast.  I didn't sail because I was heeding a quest marker, or because I had to.  I sailed just because the water looked...pretty.  Out of nowhere, 5 minutes into my relaxing voyage, a huge whale surfaced and sprayed foamy white water all over me.  I watched in awe, as Geralt's clothes turned wet and the whale dissipated slowly into the abyss of the dark water below me.

**The Witcher 3 gives you the opportunity to experience adventures, big and small, organically and at your own pace.**  It's what I love about W3 so much, more than the sprawling narrative, the amazing characters, Yennifer, or the beautiful world that CDPR has created.

Some say that this is the weakest point of W3, the open world style 'narrative.'  How you can get lost, in a bad way, and wonder aimlessly...a narrative that fails to capture urgency.  I would disagree with this, as every single side mission in the game seems to be relevant...either to the story, or to Geralt.  Quests like Witcher Contracts are things Witchers do, helping husbands find their missing wives...again things that Geralt does naturally.

I felt like the Witcher 2 lacked that epicness on display with W3.  Don't get me wrong, I loved W2...it was a linear, and well told story.  However, there's something about W3's open world that is so utterly captivating.

I created a video to honor how I feel about the game, and to honor CDPR for their accomplishments for this franchise.  It is a 10 minute video going into depth about my above points, and a lot more.  It is my tribute to this great studio.  You can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80SWZWHF3ao lc=z124ujuzmrf4vpesc22udftoiyrqjvqa104.1488761175498679)

I want to hear what you guys think of The Witcher 3...do you think it's better than any other open world game?  Is it better than W2?

I hope to have an adult discussion with you fellows below.  Long live Geralt.

	<TITLE> Are Betas Good Or Bad For Gaming? [x-post from /r/truegaming] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-06 00:09:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,

I wanted to have an adult discussion on the nature of betas in the video game world.  Now, when I say beta, I do mean beta...however many early access titles technically are 'beta' games.  So, while I will limit the discussion to pre-release betas only, note that I may overflow into the realm of EA titles.

**Why are video game betas good?**

Many video game betas act as stress tests for developers, especially those who cannot afford to staff large QA teams.  Players accessing free or paid betas can act as 'free game testers' for companies, offering their services of bug reporting and stress testing for being able to play the game early.  This is usually good, however not everyone uses in the game tools to report bugs, and we could safely assume 'most' gamers in betas are simply there to obtain free game time.  But the rest of us, we report the issues...we help influence the game and help fix the engine and design, right?

**Why are video game betas bad?**

Video game betas have the chance to present a game that does not represent the final product.  Do you remember The Division, The Crew, or Doom?  We received great betas with The Division and The Crew, however the full titles were nothing more than carbon copies of the beta we had already played.  Playing The Division beta gave us (some of us) false hope as to what the reality of the game was going to be.  This is because developers have incentive to present the best possible "slice" of the game during a beta, as they know pre-orders and revenue depend on us enjoying it.  

Doom, you may remember....the beta was terrible.  But the game turned out amazing.  It all falls under the umbrella of 'false representation.' Is it a good thing that betas have the chance to steer us in the wrong direction?  Is it bad for the developers who try to curate betas so heavily?

I produced and a video [that you can view here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_3YFvuDMI) that covers an additional side to beta in gaming, which I label as 'the ugly side.'  I don't want to flood this post any more than I already have, so check it out and let's talk about it in the comments section of this reddit post.

**TL;DR - Do you think betas are good for consumers, developers and the industry as a whole, knowing that they can often not represent the final product?  Are extended betas bad (early access betas) because they create "Burnout" with the player base (see video for this discussion)?**

Thanks for taking the time to read this.
