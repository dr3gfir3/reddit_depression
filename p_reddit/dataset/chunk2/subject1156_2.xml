	<TEXT> Reading out the judgement, Supreme Court President Lord Neuberger said: "By a majority of eight to three, the Supreme Court today rules that the government cannot trigger Article 50 without an act of Parliament authorising it to do so."
He added: "Withdrawal effects a fundamental change by cutting off the source of EU law, as well as changing legal rights.
"The UK's constitutional arrangements require such changes to be clearly authorised by Parliament."
The court also rejected, unanimously, arguments that the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly should get to vote on Article 50 before it is triggered.
Lord Neuberger said: "Relations with the EU are a matter for the UK government." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excess fluid that has accumulated in the body during the day makes its way from your cells into the bloodstream. From the bloodstream it then moves into the kidneys. When you wake up in the morning, you go to the bathroom and urinate this extra fluid away. When you weigh yourself after visiting the bathroom, you are usually at your lowest weight of the day.
Usually the more sleep you get the more weight you lose. Some lose more than others. I sleep 7 hours per night and lose approximately 1kg each night after urinating once during the night and again in the morning before weighing. </TEXT>

Oh that's right out of the two which were actually elected - one was backed by the Vatican and was the first to recognise its former wartime friend Croatia's independence - and the second a member of NATO.
And was it not another Pope who visited Croatia in the 1990s and honoured a WW11 Catholic bishop convicted of forced conversions and war crimes?

	<TEXT> His reference is to Marine Le Pen - France's greatest threat.
Regarding Trump : he hasn't dropped a bomb or murdered anyone [yet] whilst Barack Obomber dropped 26,000 bombs last year.  That criminal should be behind bars, awaiting trial for War Crimes, as should Bush, Blair, Rice, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell, Clinton (personally responsible for the murder of Americans in Benghazi) and all those involved with the arms industrial complex and the PNAC.
Yet the morons are out on the streets protesting against Trump : where were you when Obomber was murdering across the Middle East ?  It is thanks to Obomber that Europe is now flooded with refugees.
Your double-standards are nauseating !
The wilfully ignorant are a truly dangerous gang of mobsters - Obomber has brought us into War and has destroyed utterly countries such as Libya!  
In fact, he has bombed 7 countries during his reign of terror.
Where were your protests during this Terrorist's murder raids each day, each 20 minutes of every day, for the past year ? Dropping bombs on homes, hospitals, on land, obliterating cities and infrastructure...Where were you ?

	<TEXT> The unrest was the latest in a spate of violence in the country's penitentiaries, in which at least 126 people have been killed since the beginning of the year. The fighting is typically between members of rival gangs that compete for control of drug trafficking routes outside prison walls. 

A week after inmates first rioted at Alcacuz prison, riot police and other forces moved into the complex outside the city of Natal on Saturday. As a helicopter flew overhead, an armoured vehicle also entered the complex and later construction equipment was brought in.
