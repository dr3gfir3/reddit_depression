	<TEXT> Yes! I like this! I haven't been a member of this sub for too long, but I always die a little when I see that someone has made the same thing for the week. This is the way to do it, the same thing, just different flavors! I posted orange chicken and lemon pepper chicken a few days ago! Same sides for most, but the flavor of the chicken isn what changed it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just do HIIT twice a day. I usually do an abs hit routine or cardio HIIT in the morning and strength in the evening (every thing in my living room). I'd also suggest using water based weights, it really trims faster than rubber weights since the water forces you to use your smaller muscles, and two jugs of water are cheaper than any weight you can buy. Some DVDs I recommend are:  

Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred. 

10 Minute Solution HIIT with Lisa Marie Kinder. 

10 Minute Solution Full Body Work Out. 

Tae Bo Cardio with Billy Blanks. 

Insanity is good too, but no one sticks with it for over a month since it's so demanding and time consuming.  

Check your library and see if they have a fitness section  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't. It seems like a lot of carbs, but the pasta is veggie pasta so it makes a slight difference compared to cheap pasta and/or fresh pasta. There's also a lot of chicken underneath the first bowls lol (as well as cashews). I'll look at the calories next prep, but there shouldn't be a lot in this since it's just chicken, pasta, greens, dates and nuts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Grimey looked over at me then took another bong rip. I laughed at the Step Brothers scent hat was playing on the large screen in front of us. Grimey and I were in our sweat pants and shirts, we planned to go for a run but wanted to get baked first. Him in all black (of course) and me in a mismatch of pinks and oranges, highlighted by my bright yellow Nikes. "I have to like, come clean, man," Grimey exhaled the last of the bowl, "like, today is the day you're like, gonna, like, y'know, die, man."  

"Man," I took the bong from Grimey, making sure not to touch his fingers, like especially sure this time, "don't tell me that, man. I'm not supposed to like, know that stuff."  

Grimey slowly took out his small, black notebook that he carried everywhere, it was, like, his thing, you know? "How can I not tell you, man? You're like my best roomate ever, man, and the best weed too, like how can you just die?" he looked down at his notebook for several more seconds.  

I took a bong rip and blew it out, "Can't you, like, can't you, I dunno man, like, you know, like, get rid of my name? Like just erase it?"  

"No way man. I wrote in sharpie, man..." he turned to look at me, dead eye contact, his voice low and slow, "Shaaaaaaarrrrrpiiiiieeee."  

"Can I like, challenge you?" I asked, handing the bong back to Grimey, "Like chess or like backgammon or to like see who's wins with the smarter?"  

Grimey put the bong down. "I really think it's time for our jog now, man. We've got a like schedule to keep."  

"Ohhhhhh shiiiiiiiit, maaaaaannnnn," I opened my eyes as wide as they could go, but they still looked closed, "it happens on the run. Am I like hit by a car?"  

Grimey stood up, "It's like against protocol to tell you, man. Like you'll like totally like the afterlife, dude. You can fill up on snacks and like watch all the movies you want, and like you don't even have to pay for anything. It's like, as soon as someone thinks of a great idea for a movie it's like already there, man. It's like a great way to get ideas for your next life, man."  

I stood up as well, "That sounds super cool, man. But can't I bargain? I mean where are you gonna find another roomate as cool as me? You said it yourself that I'm the best one. How many centuries have you looked, man? Let's just postpone it. Hell, take the day off man, let's just enjoy the day. When was the last time you had a vacation?"  

"Yeah, man, you're right. Let's just, like, carpe this shit, man."  

Grimey and I went for a jog. We had beers that night. Two whole six packs. While he was sleeping I whited my name out in his notebook...again. </TEXT>

Now prepare to be amazed! I have a disk made of the breast of chickens as prepared by our darker friends of the South. If women could vote, they'd opt to remove President Wilson!

Use the time you have after to develop a routine, I remember when looking for a job was my job and I did it for eight hours straight; don't forget to work out (people are more receptive to someone who looks good, smells good and smiles).

	<TEXT> When you've broken your opponent down you can feel that their end is near, you can feel that they're ready to stay down; and you only need three seconds. With that feeling the adrenaline kicks in. It turns the pain receptors down and lets you fight harder and faster. This is where a lot of guys like to steal other guy's moves; but the one who does it the most has done it so many times that they know what it feels like which also leads to why single finishers don't end big feuds. The person taking the finisher has more than likely tapped out or been down for the three count before so they know what the move feels like, they know how much pain is coming, and they know to prepare their bodies accordingly. If the person taking the move is well versed then they can usually reverse the move before the damage, but sometimes it's giving your opponent a little hope then taking it away, it's that psychological damage of almost winning that does more to disable your opponent than reversing their move. </TEXT>

Some tips for addressing the area that trouble you: That's one of the hardest areas to workout, it's grouped with the lower abs so I think scissor kicks, scissor crunches are a good way to feel the muscles that need to be focused on. If you're looking to slim down then pilates is a very good way to tighten and tone; also the Jillian Michaels 30 day trim (or something to that effect) is a great workout to lose a lot of weight! It helped me a lot! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk, but I side with the dude. I think he was over bullshit excuses. Every excuse might be legit but flaking is like one of the biggest turn offs for me. Like if you're scheduled then you show up, throw up on him or near him then he knows you're not faking and you have a hilarious story to tell your grandkids. But this not feeling well bullshit is used way too much, it's like how many fucking grandmas of yours have died. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my above comment I really racked my brain about which WM main events were the highlights of the show...there are far fewer than I thought. It seems for every Mania main event that stole the show, there are at least two other matches that can say the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is why the Seth cash in was so well received. The storyline was the Brock Lesnar was so undefeatable that he won the title and went home. Roman Reigns was clearly on a fast track to Mania and people hated that. Seth was just itching to cash in but never had the right opportunity.  Finisher finisher finisher later and Seth can say he defeated the undefeatable Lesnar AND pinned the company's boy.  

Fast forward to the next Mania. Dick stuck in title, what do? Hunter! Reigns! FIIIIIIGHT!  Belie Dat Game! 

Instead of using the time to promote a newer face, Haitch latched on to the title like he always does and had one of the worst Mania matches in history.  

Hell a good story doesn't even have to revolve around titles. Mick Foley wanted a Mania main event. Lesnar and Angle wanted to prove who the better wrestler was. Jeff Hardy grew an addiction in front of our eyes. Undertaker.

	<TEXT> As a busker I'd encourage you to continue giving coins to fellow buskers, you're literally feeding them when you do and giving them assurance that what they're doing isn't terrible and someone likes it.  

In my tourist heavy town there are a few places that make a lot of money busking (legally). In the main place you have to go the first Saturday of every month, wait in line for 3-4 hours then draw numbers out of a hat to see if you can even busk there that month. Sometimes it's a 70 dollar set up fee to busk near events.  

If a street performer makes you stop or smile then it's a good idea to put something in their jar.  

As for struggling businesses I understand the feeling. It's someone working hard, possibly their life savings went in to it, and here their life is crumbling before our eyes. There's a simple solution, go in to the store. You don't have to buy anything, but if you have the money get something. I try to support this little shop that allows you to refill your empty bottles with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, dish wash liquid, etc.  They're new and I try to get the word out to everyone I can.  

Also remember to not feel guilty if you don't buy anything. Business fail, that's just what they do. There will always be a business failing somewhere, sometimes they pretend that they're failing just to spike sales. It just dawned that you might be able to buy them a subscription to Fast Company Inc. magazine. That might make you feel better (and lose less cash in the long run). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Edit: (forgot to put my age, I'm 33)I'm pretty fit, I look better than I did in the Marine Corps. Diet is key to keeping off the pounds, natural protein is your best friend as powders make you look soft and bro-ey.   

I've recently hit the gym again and it isn't quite as satisfying as the home workouts I was doing by simply borrowing DVDs from my local library. I didn't have any weights at home so I filled a couple of water jugs with water and they gave me an even better base than when I was training in MMA.  

Water weights are the best at building a nice base, sweat and diet are key to keeping off the pounds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But it's already over 9,000 now. To say it's over 8,000 would mean for it to be under 9,000 when the vernacular has it listed as over 8,000 by being 9,000+  

I understand your pain, but please also consider the ramifications that it would have if it were changed to 8,000 at this point. Over 8,000 sounds like over ate; we'd be leading a nation of children to advocate eating over 8,000 calories a meal. Over 9,000 has an R and an N right next to each other which has more positive connotation that R and E. Registered Nurse, Right Now, Rough Neck, all great examples of things that are over 9,000. Rectal Excrement, Recital Endurance, Rough Edges, all great examples of why people hate the R E combination.  

I understand this is a Luke, I am your father, situation and that you die every time it's said wrong. But please let this one remain over 9,000. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree, the best men, the guys at the top in New York never really had a great reign. The Rock, Stone Cold, Mankind and Ultimate Warrior were all greats that never had a long title reign.  

If we use the Hero's Journey to define the career of a wrestler then we want to succeed, but what comes after success? Happily ever after. Happily ever after isn't exciting. The climb, the climax in the rising action chart, the fight before the meal, that's what's exciting.

	<TEXT> Pilates, Yoga and dance workouts are all great ways to use your own body weight to gain some muscles. The App Always Evolve feat Jeff Hardy is really good too, and Jillian Michaels will cut you down to show off some nice definition in her 21 Day Shred dvd.  

I'd suggest filling (2) 1 gallon jugs of water and using those to do regular weight lifting exercises, they really help in giving definition.  

Another suggestion is Triple H's Book "Becoming the Game" it's full of great workout tips and who better to learn from than The Game himself? </TEXT>
