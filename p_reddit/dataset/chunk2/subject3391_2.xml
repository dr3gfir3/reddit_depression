	<TEXT> I remember reading somewhere that this actually filmed in Australia. Could have been another film though, my memory not being what it once was and I'm too lazy to Google it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked in a juvenile detention center for 11 years.  We did not use the items shown in this picture to restrain a kid.  We used something called handle with care (Google it) along with handcuffs and ankle shackles.  We could then use a four-points restraint bed if the kid was a danger to him/herself.  Otherwise we could place the kid in an isolation (padded room) for an hour at a time until they calmed down.

I can tell you, when you have a totally out of control child, it isn't easy; especially when the only tools you have at your disposal are your hands (no pepper spray, tasers, etc.) and handcuffs.   </TEXT>
