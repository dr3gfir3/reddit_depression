	<TEXT> I had that scenario with American Ninja Warrior, back when it was starting out and I was a naive freshman. Went to the high school on a Saturday to do jump where a normal person shouldn't jump and ended up discovering the taste of bricks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know what you're saying, but I feel like that's because of the YouTube voting system. It's only gonna show you the comments that get people agree with and "like"

Otherwise I see the same shit on Facebook and it's garbage. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Question] Is there any way I can transfer files between my iPhone 6 and Windows Mobile 6.1? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-02 20:14:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My job requires me to transfer .txt files back and forth between my phone and our GPS data collector which runs on Windows Mobile 6.1. The device we use is a CHC LT30 and I have an iPhone 6 64gb. I haven't had a jail broken device since my iPhone 4S back in 2012 so I have no idea if this is a possibility. 

Are there any tweaks that could make his happen if I were to jailbreak my phone? 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, great advice thank you. I'm definitely going to look for those signs next time I'm out. 

I have a core group who are very fun to be around, it's just tough to always hang out with adult lives and jobs. I also have a core group of Xbox friends and we hang out in real life occasionally. (All these mentioned are guys btw) 

New people like at car meets and stuff are usually pretty cool, I just always feel like the odd man out that's just present with no input/relations. I guess that's where you tips would come into play. 

Girls have always been strange, except for my girlfriends when I had them for a couple of years at a time. If I'm attracted to a girl, I stutter, my lisp comes back with vengeance, and I have no idea what to say. With a girl who's taken/not attractive they're literally the easiest person to talk to. 

Thanks for listening/reading. No one knows any of this about me.  </TEXT>
