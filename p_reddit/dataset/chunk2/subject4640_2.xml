	<TEXT> Yes, all of the demos have been done without scripting. Just with the built-in actions. No programming. Mentioning this somewhere would probably also already help a bit, yes. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's probably basically just to catch up with all the new features from the editor. Top feature is of course particle systems (maybe also a tutorial about them, not sure yet), and for sure an improved interface for drawing text, the current methods in the overlaySceneNode aren't the nicest. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right, this could be improved a bit. The main drawback for this currently is that these are online demos, running inside the browser. So they are limited both by speed and by game data (you wouldn't want the user to download 100MB of textures for clicking an online demo). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> We just released CopperCube 4, our 3D game editor. Any feedback welcome! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-01-24 10:07:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You can find the editor here:

http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/

It is basically a editor for easily clicking together 3D games without programming. But it is also possible to extend it with own JavaScript and Actionscript 3 code. 

It currently can create Windows .exe, Mac OS X .app, Flash .swf and WebGL .html apps, and with the just released version it also now creates Androids .apks.

I'm curious about your feedback, what do you think about this tool? Anything missing? Does it suck? Any feature requests, ideas or wishes? :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try some of the demos here (especially the second one): http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/webgldemos.html
MMOs usually have not that high end graphics, so I would say its sufficient. WebSockets also work already now, so I'd say you could start creating an MMO with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that people think the banks are important. Because they lending the money. But they aren't. They are the middle man between people with money and people who need money. They are not important. Somehow in the last years, the banks convinced people and politicians that they are actually the important part. But they aren't.

If you kill the banks, there will be other banks, playing the middle man. The fact that the money they are giving out is now mostly coming from states and is 'printed' is another, sad story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, already done that. Parts of CopperCube is based on the Irrlicht Engine source code, which uses PImpl heavily. But if you have such a complicated thing as a 3D editor, your dependencies and source code grows quite quickly anyway. 
Enough surfing, back to programming now! :) </TEXT>
