	<TEXT> Because AutoMod just nuked me for linking to Facebook (whoops), here's my full update to the above comment again:

I'd linked to the video Jeremy put up explaining his side of things, but apparently he's pulled it.
Edit edit: He posted [this update on twitter](https://twitter.com/cinemasins/status/653249411036811265) explaining why he pulled it, and Screen Junkies has posted a detailed reply on Facebook which I won't link because apparently that's a paddlin' around here.

Edit: The mods are quick to reply 'round these parts.  Comment is back.  I'm going to leave my mistake (SJ's FB page, not CinemaSins) because I don't want to risk the edit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CinemaSins' Jeremy, who has been friendly and collaborated with them in the past, has a side project on his own channel where he and some friends review a movie before and after they see it, in the car on the way to and from the movie.  

Screen Junkies just introduced a new series which does the exact same thing, except full of cringey product placement.  They didn't respond to Jeremy's inquiries about this in a way that satisfied him, despite the fact that he's been accommodating with them in the past, he said.  

EDIT: I'd linked to the video Jeremy put up explaining his side of things, but apparently he's pulled it.

	<TEXT> That's only true outside of Michigan. A's insurance doesn't get involved in B's damage at all at first.  B's insurance doesn't have a deductible for not-at-fault accidents under broad form, so there technically isn't a deductible to be paid.

Minitort can be used to collect a deductible reimbursement up to $1000 from the party at fault, but it happens less often than you would think.

Edit: the reason I state it this way is because, unlike other states, minitort is not automatic or guaranteed to work out. In another state, A rearends B, and after a short investigation A's insurance pays for B's damage. 

Under No Fault, B claims it all on his own insurance then submits paperwork to A's insurance company. This can be a long process, and if A's insurance finds a reason to deny B's claim, then B has to take A to small claims court. This is why some people don't follow through on the mini tort part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Exchange information for purposes of a police report.  Both parties pay their deductible, unless B has a "broad form" collision policy.

2) Exchange information for purposes of a police report.  Vehicle A pays own deductible, Vehicle B is screwed.  Certain situations may call for a small "mini-tort" to be paid out to vehicle B, but don't hold your breath.

3) See #2, but Vehicle B might be in deep trouble if the cops show up.

4) (not asked but heading off a question): None of the above applies in a vehicle-vs-parked vehicle, object or pedestrian situation.  Then it's just like other states where A's insurance handles it. </TEXT>

* This is the property where Land and Company famously decided to evict everyone one day because they wanted to sell it to a developer. It's the same one that came up during Land's campaign. It's sat there for something like ten years without anyone developing it.
* It's not hard to see why given its location hidden behind a gas station and motel in what could easily be called the seediest part of Grandville.
* In this case "conveniently located near freeway access" means the property is bordered on one side by a double on-ramp.
* The "underutilized" gravel pit that makes up most of the rest of the border isn't exactly Versluis Lake, and has some serious heavy industry wasteland on the other side of it.
* Is there really a need for any project of this density in Grandville?
* Have I mentioned this is the worst part of Grandville? Seriously, it's downwind from the sewage treatment plant more often than not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Caffeine is something neurologists call a "partial agonist" to a lot of ADHD stimulants' target receptors, which long story short means it's going to fight for dominance with them and interfere with their effectiveness.  

This also makes it a rougher stimulant than anything used to treat the disorder (hence the prescriptions existing in the first place), so if anything your side-effect-to-efficacy ratio is going to actually be *worse* should you regularly use the amount of caffeine necessary to have a similar effect.

Talk to your doctor about switching to a Methylphenidate-type drug, maybe?  I am not a doctor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really struggling to reply to this in a civilized fashion.

If you want to have a constructive discussion about ADHD I suggest you not do so by posting an article that asserts that the disorder is "bullshit" within the first two sentences.

I have a disorder that's been dogging me my whole life.  Every damn day it is the greatest source of frustration in my life.  It's responsible for two depressive episodes.  It's driven me to attempt suicide.  It's caused me to delay having children on the chance that  they would go through the same things I did.  

Do you have any idea what it's like to live day to day with something like this and *then* have to deal with people acting like it's some sort of house of cards, and by proxy I must be a sucker to have lived my life like this?

None of the points in this article are novel, and all of them have been discussed for years, at length, by the ADHD community.  If you want to have a point-by-point discussion I'm game, but for now I need to get my kid to day care and frankly I'm too pissed off to go into detail.

It's easy to be an armchair expert on things on the Internet, and it's great fun to find sources that claim to provide some counter-intuitive "this is what's really happening" view of complex situations, but please be aware of the actual people caught in the middle of these things.  ADHD is a really fucking hard thing to deal with, and shit like this doesn't make it any easier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's their warehouse, and they sell seconds, not used books (think tj maxx and big lots). 


I know you don't have any reason to believe some random guy on the internet, but I am a former employee of theirs and went from a frequent customer to never wanting to give another penny to those scoundrels because of having worked there. 


Just one of many examples: I one found a box of board books (toddler books with thick cardboard pages) that had been chewed into and filled with rat feces. I asked my manager what to do about it thinking we'd return them to the publisher or something. The owner was nearby, and he exploded at me, screaming at me asking what I meant by what should I do, and that I was not to throw any of his books away and if I valued my job I would shut up and immediately wipe them off and get then out to the stores. Toddlers chew on these things. He didn't even want me to try to disinfect them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I took a shot, and I know this is /r/whatisthisthing not /r/insurance, but your roommate's next steps should really be to get the police report and call his insurance agent or company to ask if he has UMPD (uninsured motorist property damage) coverage.  Whether or not that can help him depends on where he is (different US states have different rules, for instance). Knowing what kind of car it is won't be as important as getting coverage for the damage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally avoid the big guys and have less-than-nice things to say about many of them.  It seems to me like having an independent agent selling a policy from a Michigan-born company is the way to go.  

Speaking as a former adjuster: our local laws are very different than most states, and I've had experiences with out of state representatives that didn't understand how things are done here and handled claims less...efficiently as a result. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My most extensive interaction with Floridians has been through the insurance company I used to work for. This is all anecdotal, of course, but it hasn't positively shaped my opinion of Florida.

I once filed a Florida auto claim where seven cars were damaged because a fight broke out at a children's Halloween party.

I once had a ~35 year old Floridian woman whining to me over the phone like a teenager.  Her house "wasn't livable" (a distinction of emergency we save for, say, having sewage pour out the front door) because it was 58 degrees outside.  

Also, I'd have to say Florida takes the cake for people causing accidents out of blatant stupidity then having the gall to curse out the *other guy* for being in the way.  I once had a rear-end accident where the person at fault insisted we file a claim with the other company's insurance.  His reason? "Douchebag was going five under."

I also once had a six car accident (HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN ON DRY PAVEMENT?) where the person at fault was texting, crossed the lane divider, and tried to flee the scene.  She kept trying to tell me it wasn't her fault and it was OK to leave--both because it was an important text message.

Yes, there are idiots everywhere (No other city gets in pileups when it rains, LA, stop acting like that's normal!), but there definitely seemed to be a high concentration of WTF with our Floridian customers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just looking at that from Google Maps I can tell it's absolutely a VOR station. They aren't necessarily all right next to the airport--the one at my closest major airport is about ~~three~~ (EDIT:nine!) miles away from it and all of the smaller airports' VORs within ~60 miles are used for navigation to this airport, too.  This one could have served Fairfax, Charles B Wheeler and/or KCI easily, and given the large number of airfields and history of aircraft production in the area I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't the only abandoned/ repurposed one in the area.  I'd say you can mark this solved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_International_Airport) Kansas City International was built after flooding in 1951 wrecked two other airports in the area.  Could this have been close to one of them?

Edit: Is this anywhere near the GM Fairfax Plant? That was built on the site of [one of those airports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Municipal_Airport), and The [Charles B Wheeler Airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._Wheeler_Downtown_Airport) is the second.

Edit 2: There's also [a former air force base 17 miles south of town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richards-Gebaur_Air_Force_Base) and a former [Naval Air Station outside of Olathe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Air_Station_Olathe).  KC isn't lacking in this sort of place given its WWII manufacturing history.  

The first airport in the area was also about [9063 E. Gregory Blvd in Raytown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richards_Field) (though I wonder if this was closed too early to have its own VOR station).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> May I ask where you got that UofM was the only NPR licensee in Michigan? There are literally a dozen non-WUOM associated NPR affiliates in Michigan and we get three of them (plus WVGR) if your antenna's good enough.

**104.1** is **WVGR** which is a simulcast of UofM's station.  

**88.5** GR/**95.3** Muskegon is **WGVU** which is licensed to GVSU.

We also have Blue Lake Public Radio (**WBLU 88.9**), and on a good day you can get WMU (**WMUK 105.1**) and State's (**WKAR 90.5**) stations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This brings up another problem with two-dimensional maps and borders: 

Let's use [this map](http://www.chartgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/star-trek-map1.jpeg) for reference another time in this discussion.  The Federation is of course made up of member worlds and colonies, and not supposed to be an area of conquest like we would see using modern Earth's paradigm of "controlled" land. Say Bajor wants to join the Federation, but the Kobliads and whoever lives in the Regulon system don't want any part of it.  Do they redraw the map to include those systems anyway? Couldn't there be examples of systems where one planet is Federation and another isn't? An accurate map should color code member systems/planets and heat map areas of coverage/total membership.  

...Wait a sec... given the inevitability of some border overlap in an area as large as a galaxy (say the Regulon system belongs to Cardassia), why the heck did the colonists near Cardassia need to move around anyway?   </TEXT>
