	<TEXT> We see many pranksters and tech reviewers, vloggers be so rich on YouTube. But IMO these people have heavy support from their fam so they have patience. You don't start earning anything from the first 100k views you get. 

So my question is if there're any YouTubers who have a rags-to-riches story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Accepting who you are. 

When you start earning you need to accept the amount you are earning. There will be friends who earn more than you and when you hangout with them you will be tempted into purchasing something you cant afford. You have to control that temptation. 

Then there will be times when you hangout with friends who dont earn as much. You can take them to a not so fancy restaurant and offer to pay their part of the bill too. 

TLDR; Money management is something all individuals must know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My little brother was a rage monster. We were playing Tekken 3 I think on the ps2. While I had gone to the washroom, he set my health to 0% and one punch would have knocked me out. We fought and he still couldn't beat me. So he took the joystick and beat me in real life. Broke my nose, yeah.

	<TEXT> I know a coach who just started his coaching career won at camp nou. With ten men and a fair disallowed goal. 

Point is, in a high profile game, form doesn't matter. Man City were in top 4 in CL last season. A position barca couldnt make to. Psychologically speaking, they should have had the upper hand. But like it was said, after Messis goal, they did fuck up.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was never a fan of Pep but he did invent beautiful football with Barcelona. With Manchester City it looks like he is doing a career suicide. His tactics suck. 3 of the goals in the clash against Barcelona were defence errors. And he said in the conference to win against Barcelona you have to score more than them. Then he benches his best striker. Is he the new Moyes? Or did the Camp Nou reception make him emotional and he planned to not win this match? Something doesnt look right, this looks like Rafael Van Moyes under Peps skin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Messi is a great footballer. Maybe even the best. The way he penetrates the defence is something only a few can do. Quick tiki taka helps him too. This is because of years of practice since the Ronaldinho days. He doesnt have much experience without players who can do the tiki taka with him. So as much as Barcelona depends on Messi, even Messi depends on Barcelona. Being the best player and not winning the Copa America, is a joke. Argentina is a star studded team. And its not Europe!

Ronaldo on the other hand can make the most of finishing. He is great with headers so even if a midfielder crosses the ball in the box then it is upto Ronaldo to finish it. Looking for open positions in the box, being there at the right time is what Ronaldo does. And he doesnt miss 80 percent of the time when he gets the perfect ball. 

So my verdict. Messi's BarcelonaRonaldo's Real Madrid but
RonaldoMessi. </TEXT>
