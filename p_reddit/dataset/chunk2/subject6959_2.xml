	<TEXT> The OS/UX was absolutely killer compared to Android/iOS at the time

[Picks up Lumia 625 from desk, turns it on] Are we on the same planet? 

It's not unusable true, but it's a long way from being "killer", and certainly feels a generation or two behind the equivalent Android/iOS versions of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter how sympathetic you are to Microsoft. The vulnerability was already being exploited.

People at risk need to know they are at risk, earliest possible disclosure is the ONLY responsible option in that circumstance. I understand it benefits Microsoft to keep bugs and vulnerabilities secret, but that's irresponsible when you consider the potential harm to their customers.

What is the benefit to computer USERS in hiding the risk from them, the very people who need to make business and personal choices about their data security? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do a self-post based on the advice below. see what happens.

A case can be initiated by a candidate or voter, through a petition under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, disputing the result. Parliament can put a question before the High Court regarding the validity of someone s election. It is also possible that any person may seek enforcement of a penalty against a person who has taken a seat in the parliament in breach of the Constitution or electoral act. This right to sue is created by the Common Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act 1975. The first two of these approaches have both been used successfully in the last two decades (for details, see below).

Being pragmatic, Abbott actually believes that the solidarity imposed upon him by cabinet is the best insurance against his being deemed a wrecker.

In short, he will stop being a nuisance if he gets a bigger desk.

	<TEXT> There is a data base listing every claim that employers can access, forget any hope of a job once there.

Ok, now this just isn't true. 

Each state in Australia has a different compo system. WA, for example. has a fully privatised system where employers pay insurance companies for cover, eg CGU, Alliance etc. SA has a mandatory mutual assurance scheme, NSW is a hybrid, which allows self-insurance, Vic is similar to SA, but has a different funding process, etc, etc.

One thing that's across all states however is that privacy laws restrict access to personal records. Companies can only see records for their own workers. It's also an offence for a company to refuse employment based on prior claims.

Don't be scared into not claiming compensation you're entitled to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bishop hounded Gillard about her time as a Lawyer with Slater   Gordon. Don't you think it's a bit hypocritical to defend her when her own tactics are used?

Besides, the delaying methods Bishop used to block compensation for CSR's victims may have been legal, but was exploiting court procedures, not laws. It was never intended they be used to deny the opportunity to find judgement, so Bishop's use of them to ensure mesothelioma sufferers died before getting to court was unethical even by corporate lawyer standards.

She used those methods BECAUSE she knew the dying people were entitled to compensation. 

And unlike many of us who may have had to perform nasty tasks on behalf of an employer, Bishop has said she is still proud of the work she did, no regrets.

Nasty. </TEXT>

Apparently not:

The kids get off The Claw and said one of their belt buckles come undone right up in the air. I told the attendants  they didnt listen. I went and told the manager, and he said he will call someone to go have a look, yet they continued to let people on the ride and keep operating, she wrote.

I went back to the manager and questioned it and he tells me that the belt buckle is an added safety feature Dreamworld added to the seats, so if they come undone they are still safe."

A 15" Macbook is A$3,000.00+, and an iPhone 7 is A$1,419.00 over here.

	<TEXT> Blockchain contracts aren't just agreements, they are (or can be) computer programs that can check if criteria are met, then actually do things when that happens.

In the test case this story is about, the blockchain transaction is mirroring the normal practice of a bank letter of credit, and release of funds on approval, so there is no benefit to the transaction, apart from testing the tool. But that's like saying a computer is no more use than typewriter because the first you used it was to write a letter.


Once the technology is settled, blockchain contracts could transparently and unalterably encapsulate quite complex agreed conditions between multiple companies or individuals and automatically enact them as those conditions are met.

There would be no need for escrow agents or any other middlemen, and the transactions need not involve actual money. Direct transfer or exchange of ownership, products or services could be encoded into the blockchain safely.

The potential is enormous, it'll be interesting times for us as global trade and finance wrap their minds around the full potential. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was an opportunity for Intel to make tablet/phone SoCs that were as open as PCs used to be, and would allow any OS to be installed on them. That would have given them the market advantage that would have kept the range alive.


Instead, they flinched and released locked-down broken EFIs and other weird shit that made the hardware as OS-tied as the ARM/MIPS etc competitors. 

Without a reason to exist, they soon won't.

	<TEXT> I've been involved in helping select candidates for a few positions recently, when HR has been swamped with applications. 

The triaging technique is based around first-pass elimination, then proper review of any who haven't eliminated themselves. The front page of your resume should be geared towards getting you into the "review" pile, and yours isn't helping you make the cut. 

The advice from other people here, particularly /u/istara is good, but the first text below your name, availability and contact details should be a concise bullet-pointed list of the job's requirements and your ability to meet them. 

An example for a pizza delivery job would be:

- Own reliable car

- Clean drivers license and exemplary safety record

- Presentable appearance and personal hygiene

- Ability to answer phones, take orders using computerized POS, and assisting staff in the kitchen

- [etc](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=pizza%20delivery%20driver%20skills)

You can then add more skills, attributes and experience in the following pages if you want to. </TEXT>
