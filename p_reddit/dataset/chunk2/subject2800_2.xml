	<TEXT> My Bradley electric smoker has a blown thermal fuse. It's marked TF150degC, 10A 250V, and is in a white (porcelain I think) package.

I could get a replacement (one) for around $20 with shipping. I can find similar parts 10 for $4 from amazon, but the package looks different. Trying to decide if it's safe to buy the amazon version   solder it in, or if I need to go for the "official" one.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Advice for investments for US nonresident citizen </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-30 20:40:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm a long term (closing on 20 years) US nonresident. Taxes in the US are a bit of a pain, but I've done my best to file them. I figured out fairly recently though that I've been improperly filing info on my mutual funds, since they're non-US funds and treated as PFICS. Long story short, the treatment of non-US funds (including ETFs) is horrible, and from what I can figure out is VERY time consuming - the rules are set up to make it prohibitive for US citizens from investing in foreign funds. So, I'd like to figure out how to invest my money without wasting a ton of time or money.

I've followed a couch potato approach for years, and now I'm not sure what to do. Any advice on how to deal with this? I really don't feel like paying an advisor 1% of my money per year, but I also don't want to get involved in trying to pick stocks   bonds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a standard feature in Android to tell it your monthly billing cycle   data cap that seems to be missing on this phone. I can set a cap, but not the dates. Am I missing something or is this feature somehow not there? I've been using Android since jellybean   am surprised not to see this.

Assuming it's missing, any suggestions how to deal with this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Nexus 4 is dying after 3.5 years. I really don't play games, but I do want a high end display for watching videos   reading. I listen to music on it a lot (Spotify/Google Music) with headphones. Battery life is important, since that's been a headache with the N-4. I could probably get away with a Nexus 5X, but I don't like buying something that long after release. I'd prefer to pay under $500 Canadian, but it's flexible. I'm leaning Axon 7, but I wonder if it's actually more than I need.

	<DATE> 2016-07-19 15:02:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
(FATCA) and the Foreign Bank and Asset Reporting
Requirements result in governments warrantless
seizure of personal financial information without
reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Americans
overseas should enjoy the same rights as Americans
residing in the United States, whose private
financial information is not subject to disclosure
to the government except as to interest earned.
The requirement for all banks around the world
to provide detailed information to the IRS about
American account holders outside the United States
has resulted in banks refusing service to them. Thus,
FATCA not only allows unreasonable search and
seizures but also threatens the ability of overseas
Americans to lead normal lives. We call for its repeal
and for a change to residency-based taxation for
U.S. citizens overseas. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last time I put in a big beef order from a local farmer I asked him to include a brisket. Didn't pay too much attention to what was there, until I thawed it   noticed it's only 6 pounds, flat only, and has most of the fat cap gone. Of course I just finished reading Franklin's book   fear this isn't going to turn out well. I'm planning to smoke it tomorrow, any recommendations? Best I can think of is to foil wrap when it hits around 150, MAYBE putting in a bit of liquid. My sister thinks I should put some of my home smoked bacon on top but I think this would ruin the bark.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a question recently about exchanging foreign currency into Cdn. I happened to be doing some today, so out of curiosity I checked the rates versus posted rates, and thought I'd share the info. 

1.38504 Cdn/Us$ posted rate (on yahoo finance)
1.3452 at TD Bank (So the bank pockets 2.9%)
1.3656 at Accu-rate (1.5%)
1.3778 Accu-rate commercial rate (0.5%)

	<TITLE> Finished IJ, couple questions that are bugging me </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-21 19:21:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I finished IJ a couple days ago. While reading I MOSTLY avoided reading other people's comments - except a couple times where I really wondered about some sections. So, after the fact I did a bunch of reading online, re-read some sections, and a couple things are still leaving me wondering. OK, there are others but these two are things I didn't see much discussion on. Wondering if there's enough traffic here to get some comments.

1) What did the Peemster want to discuss with Hal at the end? Clearly related to the DMZ. Was it a warning - too late? Did it relate to what happened to the Antitois?

2) What's the deal with Phoenix? I think there was mention of a distribution center for cartridges there, as well as Boston. Is there something I'm missing that ties things to Phoenix? O requested a trade there. The AFR discussions take place there. In the end Hal's handlers are trying to get him into UofA there, which seems to makes no sense. Why would they want to get into UofA in his current condition? Why would they even try? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is an ETF really the best approach for a core international holding? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-03 17:01:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I use index ETFs for most of my portfolio, but I've always felt like for an international holding it may be worth paying an extra 1% or so MER for active management. I've been using Mawer international equity for my international exposure ( 5 years now), and it's done well. But I'm doing my annual rebalancing and wondering if this still makes sense. 

So, I'm curious about what people think or if there's been any analysis of whether indexing really works on an international scale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wife and I have most of our accts at CIBC Investors Edge, and use CIBC for banking. I do like the convenience of having access to everything at one place, but am trying to decide if there's a reason to put the TFSA's elsewhere. I guess my default is to stick with IE, but I'm curious if most people use multiple locations for different accts and why.

I should add, we've never contributed to TFSA's, so will be doing pretty large contributions soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a dual Canadian US citizen, living in Canada. In 2000 I traveled south, and spent election day in Ohio working for the Gore campaign to help defeat W. The results of that election still sting, but at least I know I did what I could to help. I remember watching the results come in, and they called Florida and we went crazy. Then, they pulled it back, and a sense of gloom came over us. 

To this day I can't believe what happened, and the long lasting results of that election on the US. It could happen here tomorrow. Looking at what's happened in Postmedia papers in the last days of the election we can see the corporations trying to buy the election. We know we need electoral reform, and the only way to get it is to oust Harper tomorrow. </TEXT>
