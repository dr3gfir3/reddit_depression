	<TEXT> In an indirect way, I would say that, sadly, yes. Viewing porn certainly has a direct and indirect impact on how the viewer perceives women--i.e., as sex objects.  Some (or many) men come to see women primarily as sex objects, which certainly has a lot of subtle ramifications, one of which is plausibly increased likelihood of sexual violence. </TEXT>

It is because of such a reduction that Tolle has emerged as such an accessible, powerful, Oprah-endorsed figure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a few important reasons why seats should remain down when not in use.

1.  Defaultness.  For women the seat is generally down for approximately 100% of all toilet functions.  For men, the seat is generally down for approximately 15% of toilet functions (based on an estimation of an average of 1 defecation per day compared to 7 urinations).  This means that, for 55-60% of a toilet's functioning, the seat is probably down.  This makes "down" the default, though I think we ALL know down's the default anyway.  

2.  If the seat is "up" and a person (i.e., a woman) sits on it unthinkingly, the result is messy and uncomfortable and even, from personal memory as a 12-year-old girl, traumatic.  If the seat is "down" and a person needs it up, he will likely notice immediately and never accidentally, for example, FALL IN THE TOILET, which really sucks.

3. Here things get subjective: it looks "gross" when it's up.  Seriously.  It does.  You can very often see things: urine, possibly some poo, and even some mouldy waste matter if the toilet is particularly nasty.  It just looks "right" when it's down.  It does.  You know it; I know it.  Put the seat down. </TEXT>
