	<TEXT> No problem at all! I do mean couchsurfing like the website (there are a couple of websites with the same concept, but I think couchsurfing has the most users as of now)! Couchsurfing has quite a few differences from staying in a hostel, some of which are: 
1) couchsurfing is free, although surfers will usually bring a present or treat their hosts to a meal or drinks)
2) couchsurfing is essentially crashing on a stranger's couch, which has a higher likelihood of being sketchy versus a hostel
3) You'll meet more tourists like yourself at a hostel versus meeting more locals (friends of the host) when you're couchsurfing. I've been to 2 house parties while couchsurfing.  

Since I'm still in school, I haven't had the funds to really do international traveling unfortunately. Most of my traveling has been in the states and Canada. 

I've never tried booking a tour, I guess I don't see the appeal in having a whole vacation planned out for me. Part of the fun is planning what you want to do and things you want to see in my opinion. My itineraries are usually pretty loose, meaning I don't have a whole day planned out by the hour. I usually plan out 1-2 places to eat and 1-2 things to see that I actually follow, the rest of the time I set out for interesting things that I come across. Everyone is different though, if you like being prepared with expert guidance, then booking a tour might be the way to go (will have to factor that into your budget though). If you are a person who likes to have a plan and follow through with it, then you can use different apps to plan out your day, complete with directions!

If you're looking to go on your first solo trip, I would suggest going in the states because you already know the language and if anything happens, contacting family and friends will be easier. I'm not an expert obviously, but if you have other questions, fire away and I'll see if I can answer them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! I felt the same way when I started traveling on my own after I finished college (most of my friends were still in college or had other obligations). Although I'm not Matt, I thought I would tell you about my experiece.

I think as long as you are open to talking to locals and other travelers, you'll have a great time! I've found cheap transportation options, local hole-in-the-wall eestablishments, etc. just by talking to locals and fellow travelers. From my experience, the vast majority of people are open to talking to other people and are willing to help you out if you appear a bit lost. Besides being used to find lodging for the night, couchsurfing can also be used to ask locals for local places to hit up or to meet up with hosts in the area for a drink or a meal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Matt! I've been looking through your website in preparation for a trip to Costa Rica I'm taking with friends in March, thank you for the tips!

I'm going to go on a roadtrip from Texas to the Pacific NW area later this year after I graduate, any tips or suggestions for a solo traveler (in regards to safety, cost, food, any absolute must tries?) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, I see that on flights all the time, a lot of people pull out their phones or laptop to avoid talking to the person sitting next to them. 

I recently took a flight back home to visit family, also flying on Southwest. I like to sit in the front so I stopped at the first partly filled row and asked a guy sitting near the aisle if I could sit by the window. I thanked him and would have striked up a conversation with him, however, his fixation on his iPad and phone made me decide to keep my mouth shut. Another guy came and sat between us. After he got situated, I made small talk and asked him why he was heading to New Orleans. We ended up talking for the duration of the flight (not too long, ~1.33 hours) about everything from food to social media. The time passed very quickly! We used our phones... to show each other pictures and to exchange phone numbers as we were leaving. 

TLDR: Don't let your technology devices hold you back from interacting with people.  </TEXT>

Think about all the things that can go wrong but hasn't yet, that makes me happy and grateful. Also, you surround yourself with positive people. Their outlook on life will rub off on you over time, even if you stop being friends with them or lose touch with them, your mind would have had time to adjust.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get my clothes from a number of sources, depending on the occasion:
1) For business casual clothes, I usually go to Gap or Ann Taylor The Loft and shop their sale and clearance items. Gap oftentimes has things for an additional 50% off and The Loft has pieces for $2.88 or $4.88. I'm ~5'0 and petite, there's a brand at JCP that has a petite line that fits me well. I'll typically get pencil skirts and dressy tops from there, they have $10 off of $25 coupons all the time so each piece comes out to be like $5. 

2) For shoes, I'll go to Dillards and shop their really good sales (75% off, then an additional 40-50% off). 

3) For formals or special occasions, I'll head to Dillards or Dillards outlet center. There's not an outlet center near me, but I visit a city that has 2 locations so whenever I go there, I'll buy a couple of nice dresses that I know I will wear for a wedding or formal event. You can typically get dresses for $20, you just have to have time to sort through everything. It's sorted by size, not style. Ross, TJ Maxx, etc. also offer casual dresses that I'll buy once in a while. 

4) I buy undergarments from Victoria's Secret during their semi annual sales. PJs from Victoria's Secret, Dillards, and JCP. PJs are almost always on super sale for some reason.

Lastly, I've gotten a few random things at the thrift stores and yard sales. From my limited experience, I've noticed yard sales and thrift stores typically offer the same things. Things I've bought at thrift stores are: cardigans, sweaters, tshirts, and purses. I rarely see pants, skirts, dresses, shoes, and active wear that fit me so I get these items at normal stores.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I currently work at Target as an intern, I started in the summer of 2013 as part of their internship program. Their internship program (40 hours/week) is terrific, it incorporates a lot of leadership building days and there's actually an agenda for every week. I talked to my friends who interned for CVS and Walgreens and they said it was just like working as a tech 32-40 hours a week.

As for working as an intern during the school year (which I think is what you're referring to), it is just like working as a technician. The main difference I think between CVS, etc. and Target is that interns (as far as I know) cannot give vaccinations. In terms of customers, Target's customers are usually less demanding about their medications because they can go and look around (dangerous for them but profitable for the company). 

Target takes good care of their interns and reach out to them regarding placement after graduation. However, if you want to move to a desirable area (major cities such as Boston, Portland, etc.), you still have to interview and compete against many applicants and there is a decent chance you might not get that location. Basically, if you're willing to relocate, you pretty much will have an offer from them before graduation. I hope this helps! Feel free to send me an orange envelope if you have more questions about interviews or other questions about working conditions. 


Edit: Target feeds you often, so if food is a deciding factor, Target is the way to go!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! 

We're not big party animals, but I personally like dancing and getting to know people (can't drink because I get hives afterwards that last for a few days, not a good idea if you're beaching during most days). 

I've read about the bus that goes from San Jose to PV, looks inexpensive and works with our schedule. I do have a question about seating area though, if you don't buy your tickets early enough, does that mean you're stuck standing for the rest of the trip? 

There was a rafting company that will pick you up from San Jose, take you rafting, then drop you at your place in Puerto Vierjo, have you heard anything about that?

If I were going by myself or with 1 other person, I would definitely stay at a hostels, they're so much fun and you get to meet all types of cool people! With a decent number of us going, we agreed it would just be just as economical to rent a house. Thank you for your input!

I'm super excited to walk and bike everywhere. The things you mentioned are things I was thinking of adding to our schedule, great minds think alike! Thanks man! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My family had hamsters as pets back in the day and my dad decided that he wanted to let the hamster get some exercise outside of his cage. So my dad let the hamster out, confining her to the area of a hula hoop. He leaves to go cook something and comes back to no hamster inside the hula hoop circle, shrugs it off and said she'll come crawling out sooner or later. A few weeks later, I found a dead hamster under my bed while looking for the remote control.  </TEXT>
