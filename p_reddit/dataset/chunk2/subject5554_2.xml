	<TEXT> I don't think WWE would try to pull the same condescending beauty pageant they did in 2007 or whatever. The social climate is different and they'd get a lot more backlash this time around if they make the girls parade around in bikinis and mud wrestle. With the NXT explosion going on and the increased interest in indie wrestling is it possible the Diva search will feature more indie girls? Undoubtedly there will be some untrained fitness models in the mix, but it would be sweet if the likes of Leva Bates, Veda Scott, Mia Yim, Candice LeRae, etc. were all involved in the competition and instead of a beauty pageant they performed in fitness trials, promo contests and matches.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just thinking today about how people idolize and respect people who may have actually been huge dickheads. For example look at John Lennon who is idolized the world over but you also hear a lot of horrible things about him beating women and being a racist. So was he a good man with a few flaws, or a colossal asshole with a sugarcoated reputation? So I would be interested in a subreddit where someone is brought "to trial" and redditors can make their case on whether the person did more harm than good or vice versa. Everyone would learn something and we could start maybe respecting people who deserve it. Some figures we could discuss:

Walt Disney
Steve Jobs
Mahatma Ghandi
Mother Teresa
The Dalai Lama
Donald Trump
Bill Gates
Michael Hayden
Rudy Giuliani
Thomas Edison (everybody's favorite)
General MacArthur
Vladimir Lenin
Hugh Hefner
Larry Flynt

	<TITLE> How to loop a playlist of videos indefinitely on a TV? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-30 18:42:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all. This isn't exactly related to cordcutting but cordcutters would be the best people to ask. I'm wondering if there's any possible way to do this without getting into complicated XBMC and Raspberry Pi stuff. I'm the video guy for a restaurant company and I would like to set up a TV in one of the restaurants that plays videos from our youtube channel all day. I've already discovered that streaming them from youtube is virtually impossible, seeing as how a continuous loop of plays would artificially inflate view counts and sap their servers. The best way to do it is probably to upload the videos to a USB drive. I know the Roku 3 has a USB port, and possibly other devices do as well, but do any of these allow you to loop a playlist continuously?

Thanks! </TEXT>

I've been on 20mg of paxil for five years and it has worked wonders. But I was laying in bed last night and thinking about my life and worrying about what I could be doing better and whatnot...is that anxiety? Is any kind of worried thinking anxiety? Because that is usually where my mind wanders in moments of tranquility like long drives or quiet evenings. How do you differentiate between anxious thoughts and regular negative thoughts? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Maybe wreddit is a little more mature than other online wrestling communities, but what I'm seeing from the IWC by and large is people being disgusted with WWE's booking decisions, demoralized by the fact that one of the most talented workers in history is being pushed aside for a D List movie star, and sickened by WWE constantly taunting the fans about never giving them what they want. 

And yet those same people snatched up the WWE network this morning without hesitation. Without thinking that maybe signing up for WWE's new subscription service does nothing but show support for the company and their decisions. 

Nothing matters more to WWE than its stockholders, and few things matter more to them than Wrestlemania's buyrate. It's an annual indication of the company's success. The Network being a smash hit only encourages WWE to stay the course. If you want to show your dissatisfaction with the company, don't get the network until at least after WM 30. Because you can't complain about the booking while simultaneously continuing to hand the company your money.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is just my personal theory, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.

I think when WWE found out The Rock wasn't available this year, they panicked. They thought "Who can we get that will bring that nostalgia factor, and who is relatively known outside of WWE? Brock isn't enough. Stone Cold has his own projects going on. What about Batista? You know the guy that's done nothing but talk shit about our company since he left? He was in that kung fu movie and he has a major Marvel movie coming out this summer. Perfect!"

So they hit up Batista and he says he'll only come back if he gets a key to the Divas locker-room, he's booked to win the Royal Rumble, and headline Wrestlemania 30.

Why else would WWE give a mediocre B-list Superstar and G-list movie star like Batista the main event of their 30th annual Wresltemania unless they had to? 

It's the only way to me that this whole thing makes sense.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was just playing some WWE 13, and honestly the gameplay is a piece of shit. It's clunky and awkward with tons of problems and no fluidity or semblance to what actual matches look like. Then I was thinking back to No Mercy, which was a lot of fun but still slow paced and labored especially when grappling. The Smackdown series was no better, and arguably worse. There's never been a game that I know of that has the fluidity of animations that something like the Batman games or Ninja Gaiden has.

I was thinking how great it would be to have a game about indy wrestling that embraces the culture of it and doesn't try to be a WWE knockoff. Featuring all the top stars in the indy circuit and plenty of different high school gyms, bingo halls, VFWs, etc. Kind of how NBA Street had lots of different blacktops with their own personalities. And it features the indy style which is more fast paced with bigger spots and more reckless moves. Sadly this'll probably never happen. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My wedding photography business is not doing as well as I'd like. Where can I improve? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-11 04:53:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm 24. I've been doing wedding photography since I was 16. I've shot about 20 weddings alone, and probably 50+ as a second shooter. I designed my website myself, which you can see [here](http://johngallino.com). I did a decent amount of work in 2009 and 2010, but since then it's dripped down to almost zero. I have a handful of events booked for next year, but no weddings. I'm in north NJ which is a very saturated and competitive market and I've focussed the last few months on improving my SEO and getting more hits with google adwords. I get about 8-10 a day now, presumably from people who looking for exactly what I'm providing, but it doesn't seem to be translating into sales. 

There's a number of things about being a business owner that I really dont like, so I've tried to build around and find alternatives. I don't go to networking events or seminars or anything. I have a facebook for the company but don't use twitter or instagram aside from my personal accounts. I have a partner who helps me sometimes but most of the business I do alone. I shoot alone and do my own post. I offer wedding albums but don't make a big deal about it because I don't enjoy making them. But they are certainly an option advertised with my wedding rates. I keep my rates low because I like to do everything digitally. Hardly ever do prints and recently have been offering digital downloads instead of mailing a disc. But when I do my job I am very good. I am great with people and have had many happy and return customers. I do great in sit-down interviews with potential clients, but I hardly have any of those anymore.

I think I just need more exposure and more brides need to be aware that I exist. I'd appreciate any advice you can give!

EDIT: I've removed the offending Editorial section and bikini pic :) The page now takes you directly to the events section. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a pretty small guy. 5'10 and 150lbs. But for pro wrestling (in the indies, not WWE) that can be okay because there are all different kinds of wrestlers. I do want to put on mass, but I'm more concerned with functional strength. I need to be able to lift people and toss them around, so I'm wondering what exercises I should focus on for that kind of strength. I figure deadlift and overhead would help most, while benching not as much? What else should I focus on to build functional strength? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-10-13 18:07:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I worked as a Writers Assistant for the WWE during the period of September 2011 to January 2012 in their headquarters at Stamford, CT. It's an entry level job that had me spend all day every day with the WWE writing "home team" and partake in creative discussions. 

I've chosen not to do this AMA on /r/squaredcircle because I feel they'd ask very specific wrestling questions and I wanted this to be more geared towards the non-fans curious about how WWE and professional wrestling works. I'm incredibly passionate about pro wrestling as an industry and an art form and hope to inspire people to take it more seriously and appreciate its nuances. It's a very complex art that only appears simple on the surface and I've always felt the stigma it gets as redneck or low-brow television is unwarranted. It combines athleticism, acting, theater, spectacle, choreography, violence, humor, drama, and much more. I'm excited to answer any questions I can about WWE and pro wrestling as a whole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Out of respect for my gaybro friends, I generally don't like to use the word "fag" or implying that gay = lesser. But the word "fag" often seems like just the PERFECT word to describe certain people. Today I had the realization that what I've really been meaning by "fag" this whole time is try-hard. That's why South Park was calling Harley Davidson bikers fags. That's why Louis jokes about the fag that says "people from Phoenix are Phoenicians." That's why you hate the fag in the Ed Hardy shirt using pick up lines at the bar that he googled last night. It all comes down to being a try-hard.

So personally I'm gonna start saying try-hard instead.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Way back in the earlier days of the internet, probably around 1998 or 1999, I stumbled upon some pictures supposedly of Chyna getting gangbanged by members of DX. I think there were only four or five pictures, and only one or two included her face (and no male faces) so they were probably fakes. However one identifying feature that I distinctly remember is that one of the guys in the picture had [Road Dogg's finger tattoo](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/166/5/1/road_dogg_photo_2_by_windows8osx-d53mye4.jpg). So either these were somewhat legit, or someone paid great attention to detail.


Anyway, is there any chance anyone else saw these pictures years ago? I want to be sure I didn't just dream this. I don't think I did because I was only 9 or so at the time and these pictures were VERY explicit and burned in my memory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any wrestling fan knows that WWE has been notorious for their excellently edited promo videos that serve to summarize a storyline to promote its culmination at the next pay per view event. I noticed they use in particular, a lot of color effects, some visual effects (magic bullet? No idea) and a LOT of speed ramps. What would be the best way to make a video like this? After Effects? Something else? Any guidance would be helpful.

	<TEXT> Forgive my rant here, but I just don't see a light at the end of the tunnel any more. Not when the prices of everything are going up, while the portion sizes of everything from toilet paper rolls to Big Macs are shrinking every year. Not when television has degraded to the point that a decent cable and internet package means over $150 a month for 500 channels full of awful low-budget reality shows. When innovation has been snuffed out of all major forms of media, even video games. It is much safer economically to make Call of Duty Modern Warfare 7 than try a new idea. Iron Man 3? Spider-Man 4? Avengers 2? TMNT? GI JOE? And any other crap that people may have, at one point, heard of in their childhood? Let's make it, because it's the only way to make money anymore. Because going to the movies costs $12 a person, and only kids are still interested in new releases.

Speaking of kids, we have 2-3 entire generations of kids forever burdened with crippling student loan debt they won't pay off until they're approaching retirement, with millions more graduating every year. The oil companies have conditioned us to think that $3.50 a gallon for gas is a good deal. Millions of jobs have been shipped overseas, because the West doesn't make anything anymore. Adjusting for inflation, real wages have been steadily dropping in the US since their peak forty years ago, yet corporate profits are at inexplicable all-time highs. 

I don't know what's happened. It seems that everything is just gradually going to shit, like we're all stuck in a flushing toilet. But I know that can't be true. Corporations and greed and mass production have been around for over 50 years, there's no reason for them to *just now* start to ruin the country. The 70s were dark, the 80s looked dark, but the 90s were a period of economic prosperity. Things CAN turn around. So what am I missing? Am I wrong here? Are things going to get better? </TEXT>

Everything from the visual design of the menu, to the old faded pictures of the dishes surrounded by flowers and lace on the walls and clearly not taken in the restaurant you're standing in, match from place to place. Yet they all appear to be mom-and-pop businesses owned by immigrants. These immigrants, I imagine, have to learn how to prepare this faux Chinese american crap because real Chinese food is quite different from what I've heard. So how do they learn the dishes, get their menu just like everyone else's, and get the photos to put on the wall? Is there some kind of conglomerate LoMeinCo who specializes in Chinese restaurant supplies? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought it was from Hocus Pocus, but apparently it isn't. The movie is about these really old women who have somehow found a way to stay young. They spray their skin with some magic stuff that keeps them looking youthful, but near the end of the film (I think) they're attending a funeral and while leaving and walking down the steps, one of them steps on the spray can and they fall down the stairs, breaking up into pieces. What movie is this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every day I see constant smugness and condescension towards anyone who enjoys Nicki Minaj, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Jersey Shore, Reality TV, the Transformers movies, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, and countless other current trends. Why? Why be such a cunt about it? Other people like things you don't like. Looking down on them doesn't make you look superior. Grow up. Half of the things listed above *are not meant for you*. You're not *supposed* to like them, so why care about the people that do? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there really a massive gay underground in Hollywood? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-09-19 18:50:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For years everyone's heard rumors that guys like Tom Cruise and John Travolta are gay. Today I was reading that Seth Macfarlane, Elijah Wood, and Hayden Christiansen are secretly gay. It seems in Hollywood even the straight guys are sometimes gay. The masseur that Travolta supposedly tried to have sex with reportedly said:
 that he got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his Welcome Back Kotter days. Hollywood, Travolta explained, is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expect favors in return for sexual activity, adding that he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up. Travolta remarked that when he started out, he wasnt even gay and that the taste of cum would make him gag. But he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it, and when he began to make millions of dollars, that it all became well worth it. While the masseur had Hollywood looks, Travolta added, he just needed to lose some weight and learn to lick some ass.' At that point, the masseur would be ready to make millions and be famous.

So what the hell is going on exactly? I don't personally have any issue with someone being gay or straight, but this seems to go beyond sexual orientation and into a culture of bizarre exploitation. Has anyone looked into this? Is it all just rumors and hearsay or is there evidence that this is really the way Hollywood works?

	<TITLE> If we want third parties to be part of the political discussion, we need to vote for them. This is the year. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Over the past weeks many of you have taken the test at ISideWith.com and found out that your political beliefs are more in line with a third party candidate than either Obama or Romney. I feel that Obama already has this election in the bag and it's not even going to be close, so this is the year we can try to send a message without risking taking votes away from a major candidate. I know there are GOP and Romney supporters on this board, so excuse me if I sound like I'm speaking directly at the dems and liberals, but it's no secret reddit skews left.

This year, I know Obama doesn't need my vote to win the election. Especially not from my already-blue state. So instead I'll be voting for Jill Stein, the candidate that I side with the most according to the above test. Not because I think she has a snowball's chance in winning, but to show my support for third parties in general. I feel that Reddit as a community should come together and do the same. I'm not asking you to vote for Stein, but to vote for anyone but Obama or Romney. Let's show America that third parties deserve more attention than they're getting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now I know a lot of people on reddit hate facebook, twitter, "status updates" and social networking in general. This obviously isn't an idea for you. But for the rest of us, I know sometimes I wish I could post a short 10 second melody instead of words. I think most people can put together a few notes on a piano to represent how they feel, regardless of musical ability. And I would be way more interested in my friends' musical statuses than their textual ones. Anyone like this idea? No instruments would be required. Maybe just musical typing like in Garageband. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to look down on the 80s for their shitty fashion and seemingly shitty music, but as I've gotten older I realized it was a period of awesome decadence in comparison to the bubbling anger that fueled the 90s. The 80s just looks like a really fun decade to be alive. I was born in 89, but for those who lived it, how was it? Did you like it? Why or why not? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Economics] Why does nearly everything feel overpriced? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-06-13 18:26:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know this is a complicated and subjective question, but I've noticed that it is very rare for me to exchange money for goods or services and feel like I got my full money's worth. In fact, any time you actually do get your money's worth on a purchase people proclaim what "a great deal" or "a steal" it is, because the converse is so much more common.

Example (in the US): I go to Five Guys and get a burger, fries and a drink. If you were to ask me what a good burger, fries and a drink should cost, I'd say about $8. However this would actually cost me closer to $11. If you go to McDonalds and get a shitty Big Mac, fries and a drink -- to me this inferior meal is worth about $5, but in actuality costs closer to $8. 

It seems everything in the grocery store costs $1 to $4 more than it's worth, and the price/value disparity seems to grow bigger with more expensive items. Do I just have a weird sense of value, or is there any statistical proof that an item is overpriced, and what causes it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need advice on shopping for my second car </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-06-02 04:28:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm surprised there isn't a CarShoppingAdvice subreddit for this actually.

Anyway I drive a 95 Camry which I love. It's been very good to me but with 220k miles and nagging wear and tear I think it's almost time to put it down and move into the 21st century.

Admittedly I don't really know squat about cars other than basic maintenance. I work in film and TV production, so my biggest criteria is that my next car have ample trunk space for equipment. For this reason I was considering maybe a mid-2000s Rav4 or CR-V. However maybe an SUV is not necessary, I don't know.

I'm looking for

- low maintenance

- decent gas mileage (18+ city preferably)

- trunk space for production equipment

- 4 Doors

I live in the northeast US and my budget is about $8000 give or take.

Any advice would be appreciated! </TEXT>
