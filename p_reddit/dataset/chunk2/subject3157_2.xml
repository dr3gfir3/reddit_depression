	<TEXT> I used 2 large beef back ribs (approximately 600g), 
2tbsp honey,
half a bottle of smokey garlic bbq sauce (4-5 tbsp)
1 tsp cayenne
1tsp fennel seeds
1tsp mustard powder
1 medium sized onion sliced
pinch of salt and pepper

Shuved all the above in the slow cooker, gave it a good mix and switched it on low.

Switched it off after around 7.5hrs and left them in the slow cooker with the lid on so that they keep cooking a little longer until they cool down and ready to serve </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Put the beef ribs in a slow cooker with smokey garlic BBQ sauce, honey, mustard powder, cayenne pepper, salt, fennel seeds and a chopped onion. Cooked it on low for 8 hours.

The potato mash is quite simple, just added raw garlic and grated Parmesan cheese to the mixture of normal mashed potatoes (butter, cream etc)

It was amazing !! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah pickle brined, Got a big jar of pickles put the brine in a big bowl then soaked the chicken pieces in it for around 24 hours. This helps the chicken retain more moisture after being fried. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest with you I personally prefer a burger to be cooked medium-well, anything below that point is not considered the "perfect burger" for me, This was another test run at trying a medium rare burger instead of my usual preference of medium well, It was the conclusion for me that i would no longer cook it less than medium well. The meat looks so red just because of the lighting and angle of the camera, plus i had let the patty rest which distributed the juices through the whole patty giving it more of a reddish colour </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The acidity in the balsamic glaze does neutralize the sweetness slighty but Blue cheese would have definitely been a great / better idea !! </TEXT>
