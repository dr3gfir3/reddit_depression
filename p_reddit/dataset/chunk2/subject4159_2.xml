	<TEXT> The point is, is that you can start over in rank, not tied in mmr, but in merch so that you have multiple chances to climb or play with lower elo friends. And nothing is stopping anyone from making traditional smurfs. That would be ideal in the scenario that the main and linked accounts got banned. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The best idea for smurf accounts anyone has ever heard... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-18 08:03:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So... Me and my cousin were talking and we came up with a brilliant idea on what to do with Smurf accounts and the eternal suffrage that comes with leveling one up, or having to play against one.



**Buying accounts Max(3)**

*The point of this is that you should be allowed to buy a new account, from riot.


If we buy accounts for 20 dollars from Riot from the in-game Riot store, it'll be a level 30 account shared skins and champions and rune pages from your linked account.



**New Players and Leveling up**

*This will help new players by avoiding the Smurfs in their climb, and allow the people who want to start fresh in a new division.


 Smurfs won't have to spend endless hours leveling up an account, buying new champions and everything else that comes with it. New players will be given the chance to learn, rather than getting flamed for their new mistakes from more experienced players.



**Punishment**

*All accounts linked to the main account will be punished as well.


So often do you get punished and banned on an account just to log in to another one without a care. Now all accounts will be banned to punish the people that the community feels should be (a new log in name would still allow you to play through the duration of the ban so it still wouldn't be a permanent ban, just the linked ones with all of the content.)



What do you guys think about this? Please Rito, recognize this amazing idea. :D

**Edit:** Formatting </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just played different champs for a while and certain ones i feel are a lot funner to play than others. For mid i play yasuo or azir, jungle i play lee sin, top i play rumble or renekton, adc i play lucian or ashe (sometimes i'll dabble with vayne and cait) and for support ill do blitz, braum, thresh, bard or alistar. Usually i go jungle cause i feel like that role makes the greatest impact on the game. Just keep playing and some champs you'll excel at more than others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my dad accidently dropped a boat that he was working on on top of himself and i had to leave my game to go help him. 

I know people get mad at people that have to leave but sometimes you have to leave when you have to leave. 

What about you guys? What do you think is the point in which leaving a game is acceptable? </TEXT>
