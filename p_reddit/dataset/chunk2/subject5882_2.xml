	<TEXT> Right, lmao! This happened to a friend of mine who tried to add her because they had a mutual friend, and he saw that she used to go to a university he wanted to attend. The pretense was "asking her questions about the school."

He asked her to friend him anyway, despite the fact that she no longer attends the school he wanted to ask questions about. She asked why, which is where the conversation picks up. </TEXT>
