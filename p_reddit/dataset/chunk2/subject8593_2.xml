	<TEXT> Oh my gosh, and your sweet comment made me tear up! So much love and hugs to you 3 and for buying one of my bunnies as well! Thank you so, so much for the support. 

It's been a rocky road, but after losing everything, relationship/home/etc/including myself, I realised I had to do something to help myself get out of the hole I ended up in. No amount of help from meds or other people was going to do any good. The problem was in my own head and therefore I knew I had to be the one to fix it. Channeling all the frustration from that realisation into something productive really saved me. There were days where I would call in sick to work and just sit in bed sewing from morning 'til night as I couldn't bear to face other people. It seemed crazy at the time, but it worked better than any medication or therapy ever could!

I wish you luck with your creativity and battling your own demons. And I really hope you eventually find a craft that you can stick with! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do have an embroidery machine I use for the pokemon and pony eyes. I had to have it imported from the US as the price for the same model is 4x the amount here. 

You're in the UK too, right? I have quiiiite a bit of fabric laying around that could use a good new home. Not so much fleece/minky but a couple of bits that can be used for small plushies and lots of smaller printed pieces that can be used in patchwork or as little accents on plushies. I have buttons and ribbons and safety eyes coming out of my ears too, that I don't use. If you want to send me your address I'll make you up a little crafty package and send some over! Totally serious! 

I'm a huge scrap hoarder and desperately need to downsize (living and working out of a box room at the minute!). So I'd love to be able to send you some if you'd let me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha! I'm planning on creating a Mudkip pattern in a few months when I'm caught up on orders, so I'll come back with pictures of him when I'm done. If you like him then, you could order a custom. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I taught myself to make patterns. I started making plushies from other people's patterns and through studying those I was able to learn how pieces and shapes come together. It's definitely not easy, but if you spend a lot of time and patience, it can be done! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for your sweet comments! 

All of the patterns are my own except for the body on the Pinkie Pie standing plush - which is part of a pattern I bought. The head/mane/tail on her are my own though.

I think everyone should make time to be crafty! It's such a good stress relief and you get an end product that you can hold in your hands and say that you made from nothing. It's such a good feeling. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ohh, I was actually in talks with my boyfriend the other weekend about planning to do a Harry bunny! I'm still working out how I could design him, but I know that I'm certainly planning on doing a Hogwarts House series of bunnies, each with corresponding house fabric inside their ears and a stripy hand crocheted house scarf! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! I had absolutely zero experience before I started making these. I did, however, always have an obsession with stuffed animals, so I was pretty determined to make one that looked half decent when I first took the hobby up. It's a bit of a steep learning curve if you've never sewn anything before, I had some major struggles early on (and still struggle now and again), but it's totally do-able if you're dedicated and don't let a few set backs put you off!

My advice would be to buy a metre of fleece material, in your favourite colour, from any craft shop. Fleece is great for beginners, its a bit stretchy, easy to sew through and can hide a multitude of sins, hah. Then have a look for some simple patterns to start with. The first plush I ever made was from this cat pattern: http://kapuschati.deviantart.com/art/Pattern-for-Plushie-Cat-165817462

Though there are probably some easier ones if you search deviantart. I had trouble with the belly on that one the first time.

Sew everything with the 'right' sides (the side you want showing on the outside) pressed together and the 'wrong' sides showing. Leave a gap in the edge stitching and turn your piece the right side out. :)

I wish you luck! Let me know if you ever start any plushies, I'd love to see how they turn out! And if you ever have any questions/problems, pm me! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I've had many people tell me that they look like they're crying and you know, it never occurred to me at the beginning that they looked sad! I see it now though, ha. 

I do have an etsy store! https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/thetinyteaparty
And the bunnies can be made without the rhinestones/white felt rim etc on request. I also take commissions for completely custom bunnies in your own choice of fabrics/colours. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I started off sewing having only ever sewn a button on a pair of trousers before (badly, at that!). It's a steep learning curve for plushies, but it's completely do-able if you ever want to get into it and teach yourself. :) The bunnies generally take a minimum of four hours, but can take up to six depending on all the little accessories and such. And the more complicated things such as the Pokemon and ponies can take anything from 8-24 hours of solid work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, aw thank you! I'm pleased you like them. I'm really, really, really wanting to make a floppy laying Pikachu, cos I think that would be adorable - but alas, I have an order list as long as my arm to fulfill at the moment! So maybe in a few months. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aww, thank you so much for your kind words. Honestly. The depression and the medication/psychiatrists combined completely stripped me of everything, including everything I thought I once knew about who I was. So when I started crafting not only was I working with a blank slate, but I myself was a blank slate too. As I created hundreds of little plushies, I created a whole new me in the process, working from the ground up. It's been a very strange but also very liberating experience.

I do take requests! I was actually able to quit my horrible retail job a few months ago and go full time with this whole plushing thing, so commissions are my best friend, haha. I've never tried a human doll before though, so I wouldn't be comfortable with that yet. Maybe in the future though! </TEXT>
