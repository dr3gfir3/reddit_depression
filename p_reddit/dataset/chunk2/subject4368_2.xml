	<TEXT> I suppose you could say I'm a libertarian. They get a lot of flack because the title is ambigous, there are several spectrums of libertarian ism that can go as far as full blown anarchy, which I don't think anyone should ascribe to. I believe in the sovereignity of the individual and the power of choice each person has, as long as no one is directly hurt by you or your actions the government should have zero say. But I still see a small government being needed, just not the global policing, military industrialized type we have now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gladly.

All my life I grew up with guns. My dad taught me how to shoot and respect firearms at very young. While not a sharpshooter by any means, I did excel in marksmanship when I joined the Air Force in 2008.

 The US government holds federal level marksmanship competitions. Upon placing in the comps, service members are allowed to wear a special emblem on their uniforms to show off their skills. Since I was a decent shot, I decided to purchase the rifle used in the competitions to practice on my own time. The firearm? Our service weapon, the M16, better known as the AR15. I purchased myself a legal, semiautomatic rifle in the state of Georgia for the total sum of $1200 (after taxes). 

I got orders to Korea shortly after my purchase and since South Korea has no 2nd Amendment nor do they particularly care for guns, I had to leave mine in a storage facility. 

While overseas I received orders to California. All my possessions from GA were in one central storage facility, ready to be shipped to my next duty station after departing my OCONUS location. This was a problem - I was going to be shipping an illegal firearm over state line - AR15 rifles were strictly banned in 2012 CA. 

In comes the DOJ. Basically, since I was overseas I had to give power of attorney to someone else to go into my storage, disassemble the firearm, scatter the parts in several different shipping containers and throw away all my magazines (anything higher than 10 rds is illegal). 

After jumping through all the hoops, I legally transfered the firearm to CA. Now how to use the weapons, specially for competition practice (you know, what I bought it for) was a different story:

CA bans "assault weapons". What exactly an "assault weapon" in the state of CA is really a bit of a mess. There are specific brands of AR15s, for example, that no matter what may not be allowed in CA. Period. This is specifically for Colt and Bushmaster. Anything else in the AR15 catagoery in CA is still illegal if it has 2 "evil features" IE adjustable stock, pistol grips, foregrip, etc. But you could own offlist rifles if it didn't have a "detachable magazine". In comes the Bullet Button: a device that converts your illegal firearm to legal in a matter of seconds by basicaly making it slightly harder to get the magazine out. Ta-da. $15 and 10 minutes later I'm state legal. All is good in the world.

That's until Adam Lanza shot up Sandy Hook. Now all eyes are on my firearm, even though if I recall correctly he didn't even use one... He just owned one. Basically, a sweeping "assault weapons" ban was in the works ala 1994, basically looking outlaw the firearm altogether. Additionally, what some people weren't discussing were the "mental health" reforms that were in being discussing. Specifically how people with a history of mental disorders were going to barred from owning firearms. Well this sounds DS all fine and good until you realize that what exactly means "poor mental health" is ambiguous at best. Needlessly to say, Obama's gun ban never happened.

I seperated from the service a year ago and started going to school full time. I currently collect VA disability for a string of panic attacks I've had since leaving Iraq in 2010. Nothing is essentially wrong with me: I'm not violent or crazy, I just have a hard time sleeping and I have bouts of forgetfulness. However, I would have fallen under the barring lists under Obama's orders. An 8 year war veteran, unable to practice their second amendment rights to fire a gun in a federal competition... Because the president says no. Sounds insane huh? Except it happened. At state level. In California.

Introducing what was known as "gunmaggedon" by Californians, that are laws that basically took the second amendment and tossed it out the window and overnight had me in violation of state laws that took immediate effect. It was pretty much exactly what Obama had wanted nationwide. What's funny is this was all some kneejerk legislation written up by a harsh critic of gun violence that was later found out to be running guns for the cartels and later ended up on Jerry Browns desk, signed with his own hand and forced down all our throats. There's so much to the current bans it's ridiculous and does nothing to fix what it's supposed to. Just Google it.

Tl;Dr new guns laws bad for gun owners. Liberals don't care. New Trump's laws bad for immigrants. Liberals lose their shit. Both are in violation of sovereign human rights (in my eyes, an inherent right to work, live comfortably and defend yourselves is extremely important to mankind) but we as humans pick and choose which ones seem acceptable based off of personal bias and morality rather than logic and human development. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are some really good Batman fan films? I've been browsing YouTube lately after finding out about Dead End. I had no idea there were so many Batman fan films! Some of these are really good, too! Dead End was great (Alien, Predator and Batman!?). City of Scars and Shattered Cowl was awesome too. Took a look at some that didn't have as many views as well like Batman Dante and Suburban Knight. Both were excellent as well but not as many views. So made me think - what are some other really good Batman fan films? Seems like alot of it is word of mouth so what better place to ask than Reddit! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not left nor right leaning. I find fallicy in both parties and I find people who stick to the far leaning policies for either party to be incredibly simple minded. This being said - call my argument a red herring. Call it whatever you want. It will not change the fact that a Nobel Peace Prize recipient orchestrated the biggest and farthest reaching drone strike campaign in world history, responsible for civilian causalities in the hundreds and proceeded to sell the American public the idea that the wars in the Middle East were winding down (they're not btw. If anything we just moved everything around). Oh and please before you go off on a tangent about our "rights", Obama on several occasions tried to pass some bullshit legislation tied to our 2nd Amendment rights on several occasions, that every left leaning liberal I knew seemed to jump for joy at, even when it made criminals out of American citizens. These things all seem unrelated, but in truth, I'm simply pointing out the hypocrisy in the modern liberal. The far right is just as batshit crazy and confused as the left, they just don't seem to whine as loudly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love how the left is all like "America was never great." And "I'm gonna move to Canada if Trump's elected." But now this happens and it's all "America was built on freedom! This isn't what America's about!" Seems like the left will side with whatever side seems hold the moral high ground. To hell with convictions, amirite? Hopefully that Canadian visa you guys were collectively working on doesn't get denied. </TEXT>
