	<TEXT> My father didn't kiss my mom at their wedding. It's not part of a Catholic wedding, so it's optional. However, my dad doesn't like PDA, so he just didn't kiss her. 

I didn't know it wasn't part of the Catholic ceremony, so for the longest time, I thought the way it went was:

Priest: "You may kiss the bride."

Dad: "Nope." </TEXT>

A Fighter's career, given sustaining few injuries, can last normally to age 35.

	<TEXT> Yeah I was planning on studying sports medicine and athletic training. Figured it would give me an edge in my training. The way the body works comes pretty easily to me because I've learned about it in martial arts. I'm probably gonna go to school any way for the backup plan. But I'm still gonna find a proper MMA gym as well. Was planning on getting a few pro fights while still in college to see where it takes me. If I ended up in a big name promoter before I get my degree, I'd probably quit school and train full time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes we practice both with gear on and off. Some of us do at least. We are required to keep the head gear, mouth guard, and cup, but only for in class sparring sessions. In tournaments, all the gear is required. I've learned to protect my body very effectively from strikes because of it. I get even more of a rush without the gear </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think of professional mixed martial arts as a way to better yourself in your combat skills. Nothing like a competition to bring you up to that next level. Not only that, it's a very controlled situation compared to street fights, where it's very possible someone could die. In the cage, you can fight knowing that the referee will stop things before it gets too crazy. 

I believe the only times it's acceptable to fight are for competition or self defense. Outside competition, everything should be done to avoid a fight. 

My draw to it is the rush and unpredictability. When I fight in very heated point sparring matches, I feel more alive than ever, and it is somewhat safer than cage fighting. I just want to see what I'm made of, if that makes sense. I will NOT be one of those disrespectful fighters. I will be the guy who's exciting to watch, kind to everyone, and a great sport, like a true champion should be </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How can I change my parents opinion about me fighting professionally? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-27 20:38:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Background: I'm a high school senior, training Taekwondo for 3 years, last six months I've been practicing more Judo/Jiu-Jitsu as well. For about the last year and a half I've been looking at how strikers from other martial arts throw their techniques, and integrated it into my Taekwondo point sparring. As a result, I've become a very good striker in my organization. Won my division in several tournaments. People always come up to me after I fight and say they really enjoyed watching me, said I did crazy stuff, etc. 

My grappling is coming along very well too. It's very different from striking, but just as much fun. It's my dream to fight MMA professionally. Anytime I fight, I get this huge rush. I love everything about martial arts. Not only am I a good fighter, I'm really good. I think it's something I could do for the rest of my life and make a living at. Maybe even end up in the UFC. 

Problem: My parents don't want me fighting professionally. They want me to become ANYTHING else. I'm a straight A student, top 10% of my class, and could probably get into almost any college I wanted to. I've had enough of school, it's boring, it's too easy, I've already got a few college credits under my belt from dual credit courses. Each of them, more A's. 

I'm thinking I'll go to college just to make my parents happy, but at the same time train MMA and get a few professional fights to see if it's really what I want to do. If I'm making good money fighting, and I keep winning, I'll chase my dream. 

My parents don't really approve of the plan at all. The say, "God gave you all those brains, and you want to go get concussions?"

I just have no idea how to convince them. I don't want my relationship with them strained because of my dream. I've been asking them to let me do ANY kind of martial art for as long as I remember. When I was a little 5 year old, I would ask them to let me do Karate. I've wanted to fight my whole life, before I knew about MMA. It was only 3 years ago, when I was about to turn 15, that they said yes finally. I haven't regretted it. But they see the difference (and so do I) between Taekwondo point sparring and MMA cage fighting. Taekwondo has the chest protector, forearm/shin guards, etc. MMA just has gloves, a mouth guard, and a cup. 

They don't want their son getting hurt, like all parents, but it's what I want to do and it's what I love. I understand all the risks involved. But my dream is my dream. Do you have any advice for an aspiring future champion? </TEXT>
