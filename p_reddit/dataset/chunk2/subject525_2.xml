	<TEXT> I think it's great that it wants players to have a reasonable jump start to building their collection! I guess we're so used to being screwed over by free to play systems that one that gives you loads of stuff actually raises suspicion... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me it was IGN. I barely visit the site, but one day I went on it by mistake and saw an article labelled "Why Shadowverse could be the next Hearthstone" or something like that. At the time I played Hearthstone, so was curious and gave Shadowverse a try. Never went back to Hearthstone. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can someone explain the "custom mouse controls" option in the steam version of the game? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> From what I can gather it has a contextual meaning depending on what you're clicking, for example, right clicking on a allied minion will evolve it, and right clicking on a card in your hand will play it. But it also makes the hand zoom in automatic on mouse over, but doesn't undo it when you take the mouse away for some reason.

Also, what does the sticky cursor option do?

Thanks if anyone can answer this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Certainly not usual, but the drop rates for legendaries in general are fair in my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the mobile app, go to "more" and then "device link". Follow the instructions and then it will email you a code that you can then put into the steam version. On the main menu in the steam version (the one where it says click to continue or something similar) there should be a "link data" option. Go on that and put the code you got in the email from there and the accounts will be linked! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem with DShift is that you're not playing against your opponent, you're playing against their draw. If they draw well you've got no chance, if they don't you win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't like the way DShift works as a card. It may be balanced, but it's not fun to play against </TEXT>
