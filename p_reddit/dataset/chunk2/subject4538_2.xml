	<TEXT> I really, really appreciate everything you've said and I actually read it about three times throughout the day to help myself keep going. Thank you :). Like you, I think it was easier to stay positive and not let myself get dragged down when I did exercise more often -I'll need to get back to that again. I guess it's just hard to remember that part about everything -including emotions- being temporary because it's like it swirls up around you and you can't see anything else but depression. I'll try my best to keep going though and I'll keep everything you said in mind. Today was pretty rough, but your comment really helped. Thank you :). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, it honestly means a lot that you're asking this -thanks man. I meant to phrase it more like it was an accident, but yeah, self-harm's been a problem for a while now. I'm on anti-depressants and I've been doing that kind of shit -cuts and burns - less and less frequently, but I had a bad day and took it out on myself. By the end of this year, I have a goal to be mentally stronger so that I won't consider self-harm anymore. I can do it :) </TEXT>

Edit: just saw sis23's reply, after looking it up I won't put bactine then I suppose. Thank you for correcting that. I'll look up more stuff about treating burns. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I got burned on my ankle about two weeks ago and it still hasn't healed. When it was first burned, it grew red and then a blister formed over the two areas pretty quick, but due to rough work they got popped at least twice and have led to pretty thick scabs over it now. Its pretty itchy and red right now. Does it look abnormal though or should it clear up soon? http://imgur.com/AIqWwaP </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesus I just feel so dumb. I always disappoint my parents. I'm always discouraging. I know its only little things but those little things add up every time. Bad grades, arguments, lying, cutting - I can't do anything right. I feel so alone, even though I'm not. Thing is, most of the time these days i'm happy. I don't mope around or wallow in self-pity like i used to. That's pathetic and im over it. I got depressed a couple years ago, it got worse, i went to a hospital,got meds etc, its all good except its not and i just want to go away. I sound like a child, jesus. All the more reason to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In 8th grade, I got in an argument with this girl about science. Thing is, it wasn't like "ooh god made everything", it was waaay worse. This girl said she straight up *didn't believe in science*. I stared at her for a bit looking real confused and asked her what she meant, and she said in a lovely southern drawl "I just don't believe in science. It's simple. I don't think there's atoms or any of that. The Earth wasn't created by the Big Bang, it was by God, and anyone who believes that is stupid". Cue me and a friend trying to persuade her that you couldn't just not believe in science for like half an hour.

That shit was stupid. </TEXT>
