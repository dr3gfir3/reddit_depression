	<TEXT> I think the reference holds up actually. Aping a style that has passed usually doesn't work, it just ends up feeling very artificial. Case in point, the newly built town of Poundbury here in England.

Prince Charles holds very similar views to what you're describing and his 30+ year vanity project has been building this weird little town that is desperately trying to go back to some ideal that the Prince holds in his mind of a Better Time. The problem is it just doesn't work, the time has passed and as you can see in the video it just hasn't been very popular and not many people live there. I visited the place recently and it just feels like a weird theme park. It looks like the buildings are made of stone but its mostly just concrete with a thin tiled veneer on top. Incorporating old styles into a modern aesthetic? I have no problem with that, but just copying doesn't work imo. </TEXT>
