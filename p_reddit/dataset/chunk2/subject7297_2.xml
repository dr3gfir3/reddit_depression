	<TEXT> I got Watchmen for $6.99 from BB. There's slight damage to the front but probably not enough to complain about. It's not as bad as the one I returned which had a 1cm circle dent depression and the disc got loose in the mail. This one is like a slightly oval push in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently at a con I was able to pick up a hardcover of Watchmen for $10. The guy said it was the international version with no sketches but with the recoloring. I opened this one. 

This week I bought the Collector's edition blu ray set. It also comes with a hardcover of Watchmen.

Same cover art, same price, same ISBN but the one from the blu ray set seems way thinner. I haven't opened the shrink wrap of the blu ray set's book.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> HBK Pre-sexy boy theme? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-26 09:16:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Someone on my facebook posted this : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WbJDhIPUbmU

It apparently uses Rhapsody in blue - one of Lex Luger's WWE themes. 

I found the Snuka match happens on 1/31/92 just a couple weeks before Wikipedia says Sexy Boy was his theme. - http://www.profightdb.com/cards/wwf/msg-show-jan-3992-5128.html

Entrance themes
"Sexy Boy" by Jimmy Hart and J.J. Maguire feat. Sensational Sherri (February 15, 1992  January 30, 1993) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Michaels#In_wrestling

Then I found this video with Sexy Boy being used before the wiki date - https://youtu.be/Icr8oGE7lYY

This is just me being a toilet seat detective, reddit, can you of /r/squaredcircle help me find which theme was used by HBK on January 31 1992?

Mystery partially solved - /u/seraphiscain already pointed out that the HBK theme in the match vid is the non-Sherri version and therefore an anachronism  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Problem with gamestop pre-order </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-05 09:24:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I reserved 2 copies of zero escape 2 special edition at gamestop. The item is no longer able to be pre-ordered.

The problem is that I was visiting family in Texas. So while the worker took my money, kind of made it seem that it won't be a problem to transfer the reservations to Los Angeles. 

I bent the ear of a couple different workers about this, all they really said was I can pay them off and have a family member pick them up and mail them to me or if both managers are OK with doing an interstate inter store transfer I could request one. The problem is liability with the items during shipment. My family picking it up would be hard for them to find the time around work and parenthood. 

Any past or present workers have any other ideas? 

I haven't called gamestop help because I fear they will remove the old reservation and not be able to re-add it to my local store.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a 27 year old male. 

I am currently in semester 2 of 3 to get a teaching credential in middle or high school English. 

I've never really wanted kids. I would like to spend my free time making lessons, and travelling. Among other things in between. 

Some of the professors make it seem like if I don't like kids I shouldn't try to be a teacher. I've really enjoyed the time I have already spent in classrooms. 

I would like to help children learn and grow mentally, but I don't think having my own children would make me want to feel better about my career.

Uw is rekt. I signature him outside. I picked him up, walked him over to the naked table. Prop him. triangle omg. Roll, we both get on the table. I prepare him for a powerbomb. The referee says 5! Uw glitches out of the hold. L1 is above my head. Uw walks groggy in the ring. 

This happened 2 times, 1st time, I pushed L1 after he clipped from the powerbomb position to cancel but it still took a finisher from me. 2nd time, I walked left and ended up skywalking as though there were 2 more invisible announcer tables to camera east of the real one. Finisher stolen. 

I tried this 2 times in 1 match, both of the attempts were on the English table not Mexican.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This only happens when it is disconnected from the Internet. 

This install is a dirty install from 7.  Meaning I didn't wipe C in order to install 10.

The boot loop happens when I remove Internet access 1 of these 4 ways: via a power kill switch to the router/modem, unplugging the router/modem,  unplugging the ethernet from the PC when on, or cold booting with no ethernet cable plugged in. 

The computer will turn on with a direct connection to the modem but it won't have an Internet connection. 

I was trying to install a new router and follow directions for the Cisco e1200. [disconnect the Internet and connect the cat 5 directly to the new router]. Pc freezes. 

After this I accessed windows 10 recovery and did a restoration. It removed all programs and the boot loop still happens. I just want to get rid of this old netgear router.  </TEXT>

So far only 1 save is usuable for the game, Marvel ultimate alliance 1.

I really want my save from the last of us.

	<TITLE> Looking for sleeve advice </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-28 22:03:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't necessarily need the sleeves to fit mtg cards but actually for an older card game. Arc system and OverPower. 

Some fans have printed custom sets of OverPower where the card is slightly larger and unable to fit in an ultra pro - not that I like up sleeves. 

There are a few requirements:

* 1. Slightly larger cards.
* 2.Card backs are not uniform in either game, mixing is a must. Ergo, opaque back is needed. 

Right now I am using ffg Star Wars and am thinking about ordering Legion serenity logo on matte or new dragon shield. 

For deck boxes I use pro dual 180 and ultra pro 120 commander. 

Decks range from 40 to 70.

I think I watched all the TCC vids on sleeves.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 15 units are suggested.

Current term limit is 14 units, this is before late July when it bumps to 18.

3 of the 5 suggested classes are available but 2 of them conflict. Yes, I know I should have chosen my classes the day I got my welcome to the program email, but its just something I've been procrastinating with.

class 1: WL 7

Class 2: WL 7 (1 open class conflicted with the only class I am currently enrolled in.)

Class 3: WL 4

Class 4: enrolled

Class 5: open but I can't add it due to limits. 

I am wondering if I should swap class 5 with one of the WL....

Also it is such bullshit that WL classes take up units in enrollment. It should be 3-9 units of WL or something separate.

	<DATE> 2015-06-18 11:05:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A skilled friend and I played my best level 50 amiibo and our theory about the difficulty is that they read controller input. 

Other fighting game players call this "SNK boss syndrome". SNK/Playmore are known for its notoriously hard bosses. 

We think this is the only way for the amiibo to be such good fighters against all sorts of players. 

We analyzed 1v1, 2v1, 2v2. Amiibo and human mix. 

The most evidence was shown in a 2 human versus 1 amiibo (level 50 Zelda, my first) wherein the amiibo was unable to defend itself against 2 humans. The reason seemed to be that the "AI" would lock onto one player and successfully block, perfect guard, counter or evade every move of one player until the amiibo chose to switch targets.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The update is 83.6mb , I tried to do it once and my internal installation said it could not confirm the zip. So I cancelled but the alert won't go away. Should I continue? 

The reason I have a modded installation is because I bricked my phone once and used a very complicated method to bring it back.  </TEXT>
