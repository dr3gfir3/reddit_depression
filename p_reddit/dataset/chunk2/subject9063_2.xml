	<TEXT> I know what you are talking about but the speaker he was mixing on wasn't actually that bad, it's still a 250 monitor. Ali was mixing in mono, that was his main point. Part of his point was that it was a "crappy speaker" but I can tell you right now low passing your bass isn't going to bring it out more. Bass gets most of its punch from the higher end like the 200-300hz range. If you cut all the high end out its gonna make it sound really muddy and fuck up the mix  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol you have an mpc but your looking for a way to chop quickly? The quickest way to chop is using a sampler and mpcs are some of the best devices for chopping samples. I'd suggest going on YouTube and getting familiar with your mpc because you will love it once you know it like the back of your hand  </TEXT>
