	<TEXT> Thanks; I have to check this out, b/c my highest toons are on ED anyway.  I made toons on the other server just to see, before actually xfering.  I guess ideally I would like a guild that does both RP and PVE at least casually. </TEXT>

I've tried on Emerald Dream (my first server I ever made a toon on!), Wyrmrest Accord, and Moon Guard, but either the groups don't rp at all, or it's all ERP...which, well that's cool if you're into it, but I don't want to do with strangers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was a real person, and I understood now that they had always been real people behind their monitors somewhere in the world.

OP, this line gave me chills.  I am an avid online gamer.  I have borne witness to the cruel trolling, teasing, and tormenting of people many times.  It's heartbreaking, b/c people *forget* that it's a real person, with real feelings.  You were able to see something bigger than you in the end.

It starts out small.  A little taunt to a stranger (the kick), it gets a little more specific (the punch), it literally rips you apart (the stab), then it hits home in the worse way (the father), and just when you are about to go someplace that you can never return from (your death), you see the error of your ways.  I teared up a little.  There is a fantastic lesson to be learned here. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My guild has been downing this boss for a couple of weeks now, but for this boss in particular I'm getting carried hard.  My ilvl is 896, and I'm an Enhance Shaman.

My issue seems to be that I'm having a hard time seeing the adds and boss with all the orbs, floor puddles, and domes so I can't target what I need to when I need to.  Even if I'm targeting the correct mob, I'm having a hard time seeing if I'm actually *facing* the mob to be dps'ing it.  This is literally the only boss I'm having an issue with seeing.

As a result I'm lucky if I make 280k dps with food and flask buffs.  It's horrifying.  Does anyone have this problem, or suggestions to help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By the end of my pregnancy I was over 200 lbs at 5'4" so, I can relate to you that way.  Four months later I started to diet (and only diet b/c while I loved the gym, I currently don't have time to go) and I lost 30 lbs in about 4.5 months.  I managed to keep that weight off for a year, and now I'm back to it again so I can get the last 30 off me.  Literally all I did was change my eating habits.  I meal prep my lunches on Sunday afternoons.  (Since your daughter is 8, maybe she can help you do it!!)  If you (or anyone else) wants to know more, plz feel free to send me a PM, or leave a comment.

Also if you figure out that "think yourself thin" thing can you plz let me know, b/c I like chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream more than I like salads.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually put basic info about hobbies with the invitation to ask for more info if the Santa is interested.  I put specific things that I do not like to avoid there being a problem that way.  I would rather someone be very detailed with their likes/dislikes so I can really get something he'd enjoy.  If you don't write much, at least be willing to respond to my questions lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL I like this idea.  But he also argues that since BabySpawn is only 14 months, he can't make his own choices.  IMO if BabySpawn isn't complaining about his hair, he's just fine with it ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read that article that /u/gileshasatv linked.  It says that your doctor can possibly help you w/ a physical therapist, and yes, a "tummy tuck" may fix it.  Like I said, maybe there's a way your doctor can write it up so it's medically necessary to have done.  You'd probably have to go through the therapy first.

IMO, if you're serious about wanting to do something to feel better in your own skin (  you def owe it to yourself to feel this way!!) you should start with talking to your doctor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every day, my husband makes a comment about BabySpawn's hair.  Says he looks like a hippy, that it's too long, that he looks like a girl (he doesn't; not one stranger has once called him a girl), it's getting in his eyes (it's not, I style it to the side and it mostly stays there), etc - the list goes on and on.  In fact, most random people come up and compliment his hair and say how beautiful it is!!  Yes, it's thick, and there's a lot but it's managed.  I don't want to cut it.  I love how it's curling at the edges.  Just...stahhhhhp.  It's going to break my heart to cut it T____T </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose it's possible, but I'm not a doctor.  Did you have a C-section?  I believe that can cause your tummy to look "off" but if you do exercises it can help bring it back to normal.  Is it possible to talk to your doctor about your skin and stomach?  I'm not sure, maybe there's a way it can be written up to be medically necessary to have it removed?  Not sure about your breasts, though....don't think they cover that unfortunately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used one with BabySpawn b/c he absolutely loved jumping.  (His was stationary.)  Experts claim that they do not help develop muscles and can delay walking, but I think as long as your baby isn't living in the thing it's fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how "fat" you are, but do you think if you lost weight gradually as well as did some weight training you may not have the loose skin issue?  B/c I thought loose skin was only a thing if you were very heavy to start, or if you lost a lot of weight really quickly.  I may be wrong about that, though, and I openly admit it. </TEXT>

Basically can someone please explain this to me, lol?  Thanks :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As others have said, you can purchase a Battlechest for about $20.00 and that includes everything from WoW Vanilla up to WoD, and you will be able to level 1-100.  Legion will cost you about an additional $40.00.  This will get you from 100-110.  You don't need to buy Legion right away, if this will help you save money or space out the costs.  I think the Battlechest comes with a free boost to 90, and buying Legion comes with another boost to 100.  Yes, the game is worth playing.  It's fun :)

When you join up, make sure you check out /r/wownoob b/c hey, we all start somewhere! </TEXT>

I'm just collecting them b/c for some reason when I came back I had over 200 in my SDB so I remember wanting them all but I can't exactly remember why I wanted them all ~_~  Come to think of it, maybe it was Haunted Woods related, b/c that's who I'd always supported in the Altador Cup.  Or maybe we're all going to take over Neopia...Hm.  Also, okay, I thought it was me with that online friends bit not working!!
