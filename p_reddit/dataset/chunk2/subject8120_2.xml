I hope thats right... It takes it there for me..

You can also find it under the draft central tab when logged in.

Edit.. that link probably will not work since it's tied to my league number.... But you should still be able to get to it from the Draft Central tab. (you will see mock drafts under it.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gronk is a huge question mark as is.. Even if he is ready for week one.. That back surgery would at least keep me from drafting him that early. I'd maybe take him now starting in round 6 at the earliest. </TEXT>
