911, what is your emergency.
	
There is someone on my porch, I dont know him, and he wont go away.

Alright, please tell me your current address?
	
12 Twin Bluff Road

Im sending the police now, but I want you to stay with me. Tell me what this man is doing.
	
Im, Im trying to remain calm. Alright, my house sort of juts out on one side, so I am walking to a window in that jut where I can see the front door.

So you are the only one there?
	
Just me and the man.

So what is happening?
	
Nothing as of yet Oh god

What?

The man is sitting there on a chair. He is just smiling at me. Oh god. Oh god.

The police are on their way.

Good. He is just sitting there. Hes not moving. Why is he smiling at me? What is happening, maam?

I dont know. You know what? Move away from the window.

Im not sure that is a good idea.

Why?

What if he tries breaking in my house? Id rather see him.

It is your safety versus your houses. Im going to try to help you.

Ok. Im walking deeper in my house.

I want you to affirm you are the only one there. Often times criminals dont work alone.

I dont hear anything. Im alone in a bathroom. But I can only think about that man. Now that I think about it something was wrong about that man. I need to see him again to tell you what exactly.

The squad car is only five minutes away.

Good, good. Im going to see the porch again.

Are you sure you will be safe?

Yes.

Report what is happening, second-by-second.

I will.

*Silence.*

He is still there. Oh god not again. His pupils, thats what is wrong.

*Silence.*

His smile. Hes got to stop. I swear he hasnt moved since I left. Only his eyes seem to follow me.

You said something was wrong with his pupils.
	
Oh yes, they take up his whole eyes. Almost like dog eyes. Wait, he just cocked his head. His face lost its smile. Oh, no. It is back again.

Three minutes and the police will arrive.

He just got up. He mouthed something:
		
Should I sit down or stand. Do you want me to come in.

No, no, no, no. Oh, good. He sat back down.
		
*Silence.*

What is happening?

Nothing. He is smiling at me. Not moving. Oh no. I hear creaking in my house.

Quickly now. Get to a bathroom. Lock yourself in it.
	
Im pretty much sprinting there. The creaking has stopped.

Doesnt matter, lock yourself in the bathroom.

I wasnt ever thinking of not doing it.
			
*Click.*
	
Im locked in. Im safe.

*The phone falls silent. Nothing is heard.*

Hello? You still there?

*Silence.*

Sir?
			
*Silence.*

Hello?

*The cutting edge of silence, the edge of something which is so calm.*
		
*The bloodied blade. Silence.*

Sir! Are you there?

**The call ends.**

*Police cars arrive the next day. There is an investigation that same day.*

*A police report says: After investigation, we found out that the man in question was lured into the bathroom, where the murderer was waiting silently behind the shower curtains.*

She ran.

*The 911 operator was found to be working with the criminals. The audio recordings show that she claims to have sent a police car. We urge citizens to call 911 in the event of any emergency. The events that took place that night were an isolated incident. But nevertheless we are running full investigations in the agency.*

She ran. She was never caught.
	
He died that fateful day.

*Silence lived on.*

*Silence.*
