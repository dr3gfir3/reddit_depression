	<TEXT> I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at what you have. I'm really looking for silver ancients, and I would love to see what you might be willing to part with. 

As for in my area, I'm located outside of Kansas City, in Missouri. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really sure how much generic ancient coins go for but I'm hoping for under $100. Less if possible as like I said its to be more of a conversation piece. Is this an unrealistic budget? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking to add an ancient coin to my collection. Preferably somewhere between 100 BC and 400 AD. Although I really don't know anything about ancient coins, I'm more of a silver collector. I'm not looking for anything rare or expensive, just something fairly cheap to diversify my collection. More of a conversation piece than rare piece of history. Let me know what you have!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do you all feel about Provident's new dabble into Diamond Bullion? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-14 15:06:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry if it doesn't belong here but you all are more familiar with Provident than other subreddits. I just wanted to hear some silverbugs opinions on diamonds as an investment. It doesn't seem too promising to me because the value of every diamond is different whereas metals have a set value. Although they are selling quite cheap. Opinions?
