	<TEXT> TBH I didn't know you could tweak it so didn't give it much of a chance when it started to act up. Maybe there's a guide out there to assist in situations line this? Thanks for your reply.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Paid sports packages with slower rural Internet? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-26 16:10:14 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I think I know the answer to this but I'll ask anyway. 

I live in the country and have wifi-only internet that hovers around 8-9 mbps download, which is pretty good for a rural area, but probably considered to be a minimum speed for Kodi. I tried a Smoothstreams trial about 2 months ago and it was great but just too laggy. Does anyone out there live in a rural area and have good luck with a paid sports subscription? If not, I guess I will continue trying to get streams through ProSport and SportsDevil. 

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Specto   SALTS with RD are the way to go. I agree, Exodus is not what it used to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Godfather II. I guess because the 1st one was such an awesome film, I don't want to be disappointed by the sequel...we all know how sequels usually turn out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may be common knowledge for most ppl here but I felt like such an idiot when I determined that I didn't do this. I have RD and was only putting it in my info in the actual add-ons. It was not working well, did some searching and found out you need to put it in your actual Kodi settings (duh). Don't forget to do this, it makes a ton of difference! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exodus is not working for me either. I am paid up with RD until May and have flip-flopped between renewing and letting it go but it has been bad more than good for me personally. I found if you put Exodus (or Specto) on auto-play, it ultimately will play the best stream available even without RD and this one more often than not works out ok. </TEXT>
