	<TEXT>  Of course I'm serious, he was well known in the movie buff crowd but regular people didn't go see his movies based on the strength of his name until after Titanic.

That's just simply not true. Cameron's films have never been just for movie buff crowd and he has been regularly in prime time talks shows like Letterman since 1980s and often interviewed in mainstream magazines like New York Times etc. 

Of course directors aren't most often as famous as biggest movie stars with the exceptions of people like Hitchcock, Polanski or Spielberg (and arguably James Cameron), but when compared to other filmmakers James Cameron has been quite well-known since mid-80s and household name since 90s.  Compare that to Villeneuve who is already 6 years older than Cameron was when Titanic was released and yet he has virtually unknown to general public. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  General public didn't know Cameron before Titanic

You can't be serious. He was absolutely one of the best known directors in the world even before making Titanic. I mean both T2 and True Lies were both most expensive movies ever made at the time and T2 was highest grossing movie of the year. And The Terminator, Aliens and Abyss were not exactly low-profile either.

	<TEXT>  I was just saying that studios love those three because they can make money back on their projects

You can't even speak about Villeneuve in same sentence with Cameron and Nolan when it comes to profits of their movies. Cameron has literally made two of the highest grossing movies in the history and Nolan's 4 last films have average Box Office Gross of about $900 million.

 $80 million return.

Box Office Gross  return. Studios get on average 50% of domestic gross and on average 39% of foreign gross. And that $30 mil budget was only for production, who knows how much they used for marketing.  I am not saying it was flop or anything and at the end of the day it probably made nice profit for a film like that but it's not like studios are rushing to produce anything from Villeneuve which is absolutely the case with Nolan and Cameron. </TEXT>
