	<TEXT> So we have Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Klitsch (I may have butchered his name I know).

So Taylor's character is the highway patrol right? So since he found the body he's on the team.

What makes the Colin's character and Rachel's character part of the team? Colin's character is like the local PD right? Or is that Rachel's character?

Also, if someone could give me the names here I'd much appreciate it :)  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The little arc we get after "Super Seven" is Pandora right? I'm beyond confused about what's going on there but I know I'm soon to find out right?

But is that there just to set up the Trinity War? Also, is the Trinity War it's own volume of the Justice League collection or will I need to pick it up between 4-5 or something? Is there anything else I should before it too?

Thanks!

If you show up and notice I often ask the same question to two different replies I'm just looking to get a variety of answer and the question may apply to both replies of this post. Sorry if it looks spammy to you. </TEXT>

Getting off track here..

So assuming it's the Justice League with Superman, Batman, Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg. Who would you cast as Cyborg?

PS: Also, how many different versions of the JL are there? I know there's one with Martian Manhunter (forgive me if it's wrong) right? Who does he replace in that version or is there just 8 in that case? </TEXT>

Right now I need a wallpaper. I've googled it and found nothing. And by nothing I of course mean I can't decide. 

Right now I'm rocking [This] (http://p1.pichost.me/i/26/1494135.jpg) 

I really, really like [This] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/39/3b/2b/393b2b0581e1a78e2a74955ea3ee198e.jpg) but it's only 5 and I'm aiming for the 7.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm not going to go into episode by episode details and whatnot but just a few things.

The intro, imo, couldn't have been any better. It sets the tone for the series to me.

The reveal of the villain was perfect. You think they're just showing us a clip of the detectives doing a run around job... No. You slowly see the scars on his face. I honestly leaned forward in awe, eyes glistening as my mind realized who it was. 

What can I say about the actors that hasn't already been said? Woody is the perfect down south, roughing it, old school guy they needed to counteract McConaughey's tidier, observant detective. 

There are a lot of other things to point out but Episode 1 of the new season just downloaded so I'm giving it a try, although I've heard it's not quite as good and even though this show did a lot for McConaughey I still can't imagine getting invested in either Vaughn or Farrell.

Love some thoughts on the matter because as you can see, I'm struggling with what I should talk about.

	<TEXT> So my local book store has starting selling comic books. And by starting I mean it's been there a few months now apparently I just never realized.

So I bought The New 52, Justice League. Honestly, I was looking for Injustice but they didn't seem to have it so this was next because I heard about it from DJ at Sourcefed. 

So it's a complete revamp of the of the Justice League right? Hence THE NEW 52! I'm guessing every dc kind of has his/her own revamp but I just picked up the collection with 7 characters. 

So... Without getting too complex about this. After this series, would I be able to pick up one of the Batman series, I'm not sure of any names, the only one I know is Nightfall and I'm pretty sure that's just one big novel. But you know, a collection of 5-6 books. Or should I ask the store to order an "original" Batman series?

I'm sorry if this question is convoluted or idiotic in the way it's written, I'm just super excited right now because this is my first ever comic book.. (I'm 18 /3) 

THANKS!

	<TEXT> I love a good Assassins Creed trailer. When you see Ezio in Rome, I loved it. When you see the pirate story for Kenway, loved it. 

But Revelations.. Dear god. Everything from him on the ship, him in the mountains, then him getting shot with an arrow which led to a massive fight, and bang, he sees fucking Altair.

IMO, this is the best AC trailer so far.

	<TEXT> EDIT: FORGOT TO ADD THEORY SORRY! It's all a theory I guess!

So Jon is "dead". Everyone at HBO right now is saying he is dead.

We all know he ain't dead though. But HBO have to keep up the cliffhanger for the folks around that are too... Well, they haven't figured it out yet. 

So do we want some Jon in the trailer or should they make his little plot a very sad one, showing it like he is dead. Maybe his body on a table. Then when the season starts it was Mel who had his body on a table before Azor rises.

Or do we want some Jon, alive, in the trailer? I for one couldn't think of a better hype up.

I'm getting off my own topic but thinking about the shit we're gonna get for the trailer that is like 8 months away...

Blind Arya, Sam becoming a maester, Jaime finding Cersei, Cersei losing her mind, Tommen with Tommen struggles, BRAN!, Jon or no Jon. 

Oh my god... 9 months. How.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just thought I'd make a post because I'm 30 minutes into PKN and well...

Listening to the guys talk about GoT used to be a highlight of PKA for me.

I was about 200-300 pages short of the end and bang. The single greatest spoiler ever just got dropped on me. It was all fine, oh there was no battle in the show but in the books, oh hey since we're doing spoilers, bang. Day ruined.

I get I'm coming off super ranty but I don't know how else to put it. I'm 100% irrelevant in the hosts lives but damn am I upset. All Woody ever talked about before reading was how great they are for keeping all these secrets. Now whenever the show is brought up he has to drag it into the books. I'm not sure where Kyle stopped reading but at this point should he even bother? Woody clearly knows he's behind but still.. Oh Dany getting on the dragon happened like this instead of this, etc.

I doubt Kyle cares too much but I just need to get this off my chest because I'm pretty sure I feel the same as a lot of people in this matter. 

If you read this Woody, sorry for coming off ranty but please figure out a system for GoT talk. At least for next season now that it's over. Even a banner or hat. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So from the second this game was announced I was hyped for it and upon release I had it... But on last gen consoles it runs like absolute shit IMO of course. 

The load time between gameplay and the pause menu can reach up to 10-15 seconds. The textures tended to bug out a whole lot and instead of a burnt field or a destroyed tower you're just climbing a grey wall or running across a bumpy black ground. 

So... Is it worth dropping 50 euro knowing those bugs won't happen on digital or will it run the same?

So how does Cloud gaming work? You store the game on their servers for a fee per month or something and then you can stream it to your pc while their systems run it for you? 

What exactly is a provider? I've tried looking up the ones from the wiki page but the Nvidia thing doesn't drop until the 30th and the others seem to be dead ends. 

So am I just too early to use it or am I just so dumb I can't see how easy it is?

	<TEXT> So I ran all the quests in Combe to the point where the main quest was the only option left and now I'm running it. And I'm also trying to keep up with the area I should be in for levelling (I missed a whole lot of the WoW world because I didn't level it correctly). 

I'm guessing the main quest takes me to Bree right? I'm guessing there are a good few quests there for me yes? So I'll be like 20-25 by the time I clear out Bree. So should I drop 500tp for North Downs even though I have no idea where it actually is on the map and I still have the entire Ered Luin area. Or is Ered Luin just somewhere I don't need to go because I started in the Shire and they're equal? Looking on the site it does say North Downs is after Bree so I'm guessing this post was pointless but I'm still looking for some help on how I make sure I level in the right area. 

EDIT: ALSO! There's no reason for me to buy the quad pack yet is there? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So... Before we start, I'm on ASOS but know about Jon Snow.

He is left on the cliffhanger that he is dead right? But apparently Melisandre is at Castle Black and she'll likely resurrect him or something. I have no idea really. But we are left with the assumption he is dead.

So who does that sit with the fact Kit Harington's contract is up until the end of 2016 and Season 6... 

His contract of course can be renewed for after it (Although this is ASOIAF) but even then, does that mean he's going to be saved in TWOW and go on with something in his plotline? Could the fact that Melisandre is NOT in Castle Black in the show mean they're not going to gut him in this episode? Could they stall it out for another season or so? 

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter but just remember I'm only a few chapters after the Red Wedding so bringing up other storylines with a spoiler tag would be much appreciated. </TEXT>

Is it the elvish god? It couldn't be could it? Knowing Eru is god seems kind of universal or is he known as the creator and other's believe in their own gods? 

Also, there was talk of people in the Shire before Hobbits. Were they elves or man? And there was a whisper of life in the Shire after Hobbits. Do we go that far in time or is that just an idea? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you may have seen me around here lately and it's because I'm getting into the game. 

I subbed yesterday and after hours of downloading then another hour or two of deciding a class, which I finally decided was a Beorning..

But I only have 500 TP, well I got 10 for the first TP quest you get in the town square as the elf start. 

Is there a trick to picking up quick points, do I just have to play out the hunter (because I've found it to be the best solo class) and eventually I'll get enough points to start with a new class. I remember getting the bounty type system way back when but they  were crazy challenges like get a certain 1000 hits with a spell or something. Are they all like that or is there a trick? 

I know people may hate farmers but damnit I'm dying inside knowing if I can't do this I have to wait a few weeks to buy points :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm coming back to this game and I'm trying  to choose a class but I'm really struggling. I played Hunter in WoW and a bit in this so I'm just done with that whole class for now. I took a look at Guardian but I'm not sure how hard it would be to level a tank in solo. Then the two advanced I'm looking at are Beorning and Warden. I tried Lore Master a few months back, got to 15-20 and just got overwhelmed by what I had to which I've recently come to understand I never should have started with that. So is Beorning and Warden just as hard as LM or is that the harder of the three advanced level classes? 

I'm fine with going guardian if you guys believe it's too tricky to start with either of the other 2. I'm gonna sub so I'll also get the 100%xp bonus. But how hard is levelling a Guardian? Does he have any damage before or after choosing a skill tree?

Love some help right now. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lived through years of Christmas eve's as a child and this wait does not compare. I sat for 11 hours in one day hitting refresh every few minutes waiting on an email confirming if I got a college interview or not. This does not compare.

Every now and then I wonder what's so great about living in this gamer/nerd bubble/world I live in and today is the answer. I've never felt such excitement and fear at the same time.

Can a 5 year wait really be something we can expect them to live up to? Will it be a completely new version of fallout as F3 was to F2? Could it have Co-op? Should it?! Is there going to be heavy influence on multiplayer or will it be an offline game? 

I'm sitting here writing this now wondering what I can do for 5 hours so I think it's about time I get out of bed and kick on Fallout 3. Lets hope it keeps me sane for now.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So ever since episode 1 of season 1 we've heard Winter is Coming. They are both Stark words and a true fact. But to me at least those words have kind of been ruined by the sheer amount of "___ is coming" meme's and just the jokes about how it's never actually coming. 

So when Jon was speaking to the elders during S05E08 about how their children will never have children it started to resonate with me. All this talk of the darkest night the world has ever seen or the darkest in centuries. How the darkness will bring only death etc. 

Something about it has always been grim but this episode finally put it into perspective for me and when I hear those rumbles from the cliffs.. I sat in horror/awe as I waited for the charge. Then seeing him raise the dead just shows the type of power we're dealing with.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, let me preface this by saying I'm only on ASOS. I've had something spoiled for me and after this weeks' episode/preview for the next one I need to vent. 

So Jon Snow dies, supposedly, it's not known if he's actually dead or not right? Well, someone told me he was dead but I've come to understand it's kind of left open. 

How the fuck have you guys lasted so long in knowing this?! Season 1 aired around the same time ADWD dropped right? That means you all know he's been set up to die even though you had to watch him grow for a second time (once in book, once on screen) only to know he's going to get betrayed by his honor (Typical "Stark"). 

I just had to vent and I'd love to hear how you feel about it but I'm very touchy in some areas. I've been told Dany rides Drogon (although that's kind of a reach, although somehow likely.). Sam becomes a wizard or something along those lines but when it comes to Jon's 'death' I'd love to hear how you've all lasted this long. I've known for a week he's getting killed off or he's being set up for this season's cliffhanger and I can't handle the notion.  </TEXT>

Is the whole idea of splitting ADWD universal or can I pick up a heavier, complete version somewhere else?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm thinking about buying it after all this time. But I played Demon Souls way back when and hated it. I felt it was way too clunky or something for the difficulty it had. Maybe it was me, or how  bad I was at games at the time (if I couldn't walk through it after 3-4 times I'd just lose interest, I know, I was horrible).

But after all this time.. It looks pretty good. But I've heard DS 1 basically punished you for doing bad so the longer it took you the harder it got and you got into this never ending pit. Is DS2 like this? 

Also, what's the story like? Is it worth investing in or is it just the gameplay and difficulty that attracts people to it or what?

	<TEXT> So I made a post a few hours ago talking about how weak I've felt this season has been. Not even weak, just off, weird, slow, shit is happening but it doesn't feel like it and I guess it's mostly because this season is setting up big stuff for next season or this is a transitional/ filler season. 

But this episode.. It may be on par with the rest of the season and I just don't notice because I woefully want a good episode and I've only slept 4 hours since 10am Saturday (now 6am Monday) so I guess that hope and lack of sleep could have mixed to make me believe this was good. 

But all in all it felt the most Game of Thrones the show has for a while now IMO. It had fighting. It had blood. It had boobs. It had a death. It had a wolf. It had a whitewalker mention. It had a nice cliffhanger and it had a whole lot of snow (it's finally coming guys.) 

(Quick add in: It had the first Dorne scene I've liked so far. Bronn has quite the voice) 
I would do a little attempt at summarizing each characters plot this week but I'm both no good at it and I'm going to try sleep now so just leave your thoughts down below to how you felt about this week's episode and I will either reply within 20 minutes of this post or in a few hours.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I feel as if this season has felt weird in some way(Happy? lol) . I can't put my finger on it but as someone who really doesn't this show to be bad I can't help but feel something is wrong with S5. Maybe it's dorne. Maybe it's King's Landing. Maybe it's the whole merging two massive books into one season deal. It may just be this is my first season that I've regularly checked this sub and seeing all the book reader complaints has fogged my love a bit, I don't know. 

But.. There's so much being built up right now that is about to fucking explode.

With Arya- She's getting towards the end of her training and when she's done I don't see where it's going but I can only expect awesome. (Although the whole faceless man shtick is them changing faces of course which I don't really look forward to because I've become a fan of Maisie.) 

Stannis- He's charging on motherfucking Winterfell with a massive army and I can't see him losing. Although Brienne is still kinda skulking around up there although I doubt she could kill him (I bet the sub would lose their shit because I doubt that's in the books, just seems off.). 

Sansa- She has a whole candle to light and who knows what is gonna happen to Theon. Hopefully he becomes Theon during the battle and fucks shit up.

Jon- I'm not quite sure with Jon. He's off on this savior mission but in the trailer he comes marching off that boat like he's running to battle so... Another battle is a plus I guess. 

Dany- She's about to open the fighting pits and the trailer shows it's gonna be chaos. Let's hope Drogon makes a special appearance and burns those harpies (their called harpies right?)

Tyrion- I just want him to share some good ruling advice and fix her up a bit. 

Jorah- I'm not really sure what's up with him. The Stannis talk did suggest a cure for it and the Red Priest in Volantis (I'm not good with the locations of Essos so I don't know if that's it or not) seemed way too important to only get 2 minutes of screen time.

Cersei- Apart from her being abused by Marg and the Queen of Thorns I'm pretty uninterested in the whole faith of 7 story.. I feel bad for Tommen though. Poor guy just wants to be a gentle king. 

Jaime... The banter between him and Bronn is the only worth while part of Dorne right now. Although now that he is going to Doran I can see something coming of that. Too guys just having a normal chat while that crazy bitch is pushed away(hopefully).

Overall. It kind of turned into a review and I feel I'm forgetting someone but oh well..

TL:DR Battle, battle, bromance, dragon vs harpies, Sansa and Theon stepping up their game, faceless Arya. Hype.

Oh. It could also have something to do with the fact I plan on picking back up ASOS once the season ends so my excitement for that could be a subconscious reason I'm uninterested this season.  

EDIT: I am not speaking for the majority of this sub-reddit of fandom. I only put it that way because most of what I have seen is how it's not as good as other seasons although that is an opinion. This is mine, don't think I'm writing as fact,  if you that's how I come off I'm sorry.  </TEXT>

If I have to do it I will but if someone already has it done I'd really, really appreciate a copy of the text. Thanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I don't play Civ too often because I can't run it too well.

So recently I heard someone speak about a mod but it's tricky to explain.

When you have a settler, worker, warrior etc. They show up as a group of people right? 5 or 6 little people on the one tile. 

But this mod makes it so instead of 5-6 people it's just 1.

I don't even know if it'll help me run the game better but I plan on trying it out anyway.

If you don't know this mod but do know some mods that make it run better I'd really appreciate it. </TEXT>

Can you stop talking about every difference between book and show? 

I understand how you feel and that talking about the differences can help review the episodes so to speak but telling us that Jaime is in the Riverlands instead of Dorne.. 

It's very nit-picky I know but because they're diverging from the book I'd like to not know what's going on there so when the season ends I'll have a new version of the story to see.  </TEXT>

So instead of ignoring something that looks interesting I thought I'd ask you guys. If you've read it I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether it's worth the buy or not.

	<DATE> 2015-05-20 05:05:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a post I just made on /r/theflash but I'll post it here seeming this sub is for the show.

So this episode... Well I can't put it into words just yet but here's 3 things that broke me. Well before I start I'll just say the soundtrack to this show does the perfect job at setting a tone. Now here goes.

(Before we start and get emotional I should add in the snap of Killer Frost was fucking awesome and got me extremely hyped for S2)


- When Barry is saying his goodbyes and he looks to Joe and says "goodbye dad" and joe hugs him "goodbye son" paraphrasing I think. 

Joe was willing to give up all those years of having a son for Barry to have a real family. Not knowing what would change for him through it but willing to let it all go..

- When Barry gets to the home, opens the door and the future flash puts his hand out as if to say no, then he closes the door and just takes in all that pain... 

Just.. Something about the way future flash said no really got to me inside. Let it happen Barry. You have done everything in your power to save your mother but please, let her go. This must happen.. 

Now this moment.... I don't know how to describe what happened to me. It wasn't crying. Everything in my body clenching. My hands grabbed my face (i now have a cut under my right eye thanks to my long index fingernail). My jaw dropped, it didn't hang either it was the stiffest I can remember it being. My eyes just leaked and leaked..

- Eddie gave up his life to end Eobard. When I heard the shot I thought typical save the hero by shooting the bad guy but no. Not at all. He felt so insignificant this episode and then found some kind of meaning with Iris which he then sacrificed for the sake of the world. 

At the start of the season I asked for Eddie to get something meaningful to do during each episode because to me at least he was just a backdrop character. He was somewhat on screen but only because of his relation to a main character.

I wish I never asked that. They should have left him back there... Not do that... I went from not caring about him to being emotionally broken inside because of his death.

Thank you CW. Thank you for what you have shared with us over the past year or less. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So 3D movies have been mostly hit and miss but then there's that one spectacle that pulls it off. Gravity. Avatar. That's all I can name really because I never bother with 3D.

But Mad Max is out this Thursday and it's one of the few movies I'd be willing to travel for 50 minutes on a bus to see in IMAX. But it's only available in IMAX +3D. 

I should do it right? Or should I miss out on the imax thing and play it safe with 2D at my local theater?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [All Spoilers] [Theory] Can we talk about a little theory that, at this point is basically set in stone? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-11 15:27:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I put All Spoilers in the title because I don't believe the show has pointed to it truly enough for someone to pick up on it and you need the books to solidify it BUT I'm only on ASOS so anything AFFC, ADWD can you tag please? 

Now... R+L=J . We still call it a theory simply because it's not on paper yet. But we all kind of know its 99% true right?

A Song of Ice (jon) and Fire (Dany).

The episode 4 scene with Baelish in the tombs, giving a very odd look when Sansa said Rhaegar raped Lyanna because it's most likely they loved one another.

The tourney of Harrenhal of course.

The fact that Ned Stark would never truly father a bastard son.

There's a whole lot more of course but last night just pushed it over the edge for me.. That scene with Sam and Aemon talking about Dany. I can't quote it exactly but something like "A lone Targaryen out there." "the last targaryen is alone out there". something like that, then Jon walks in and just stands there..

So at this point, is anyone still questioning it simply because it has "theory" hung above it's head or are you with me in accepting that at some point Jon is going to learn he's a Targaryen. Whether it's true Aemon, he leaves the wall and runs into Dany somehow (although I highly doubt that), or he somehow finds out on his deathbed.

When you're replying just be sure to remember I'm only a few chapters before the red wedding so telling me where jon is ADWD or AFFC would be painful for me.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So next week Barry, Ollie and Firestorm are facing off vs Wells/Thawne.

But... Oliver has shit to do. In the Arrow promo he's dealing with the league next week and that's a day after Flash. How are they going to pull that plot point out of nowhere? He tells Ra's he needs a few personal days right after his marriage and a load of dead ( not really, we all know they're not but technically the show writers make it seem like they are).. If Arrow was on the day before Flash instead of the day after it might make sense but I can't see how this is going to be done.

	<TEXT> So this is gonna sound strange but..

I've always like baseball. I've always wanted to play it. To watch it. To understand the game. But I'm Irish. So I can't just throw on a sports channel and watch it and I hate having to find those virus filled streams and whatnot so I plan on subbing to MLB.TV.

But.. How far into the season is it? Because I've heard baseball is a spring time sport and is over at the start or during summer right? 

Basically what I want to know is how long exactly is there left is the regular season then the whole world series and whatnot. +if there's not that long left, is there a place besides mlb tv where I could find the games?

EDIT: Since I'm now planning on getting it. Normal or Premium? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard nothing of it and it seemed to be some parkour, fast paced movie and I cut the trailer right as the guy pulled a shotgun so the trailer doesn't ruin the movie for me.

In saying that, is this a movie worth watching? I seen it got a 22 on RT but I've never been one for their reviews.. </TEXT>

We see Hawkeye go off to his quiet life which by the way, I absolutely loved how much focus he got this movie. 

Tony drives off into the sunset and that's because his contract is just done with Marvel right? Or at least for Avengers.

Then Bruce took his stealth jet and used it as an escape. 

Thor is going back to deal with his dreams or something and that will most likely be Ragnarok right? 

Then we're left with Cap, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, the guy with  the infinity stone and then the wings guy and war machine/iron patriot. 

Forgive me for not knowing their names but they're the new avengers right? When the Civil War comes about... Wait, they need Tony for that right? But when all these upcoming movies crossover each other will we be getting a lot more scarlet witch than we would before? 

+... This whole thing with Thanos. Isn't that a major plotpoint for the Guardians too? And seeing as Guardians is in the future right? Because Earth is Tera or something. How do they both have the same villain in different timelines? Are they actually not in the same cinematic universe? Like how we got Spidey a year ago but not once was New York's avenger battle mentioned. 

I'd just like some help with everything because I'm going back to see it on Wednesday and I'm really looking to get into the universe and background information. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm a sucker for lore and last Friday I bought The World of Ice and Fire. 

But I'm also reading ASOS and I'm about 5-7 chapters away from the Red Wedding. But I have often gotten moments from the books and show mixed up by reading them parallel too. I was reading ACOK along the time of re-watching the series and that sure messed me over a bit.

So is leaving ASOS until season 5 is done a good idea? I've come to understand that by the end of it it's starting to split from the show and overtake some of the characters story progress but I've also heard this season is just going straight up and moving away from the books. So I would be better off leaving it until the season finishes then getting through the books and knowing where I stand instead of getting storylines, plot-points mixed up etc.? 

+Just had to add in.. The artwork in "The World of.." is absolutely beautiful.  </TEXT>

In saying that..

So is there anywhere I can buy another one or some app that I can install to get it done? 

I've tried the software the website gives you but it's just editing software and whatnot. 

I'd really, really appreciate some help in the matter because the camera needs to be returned soon and I can't lose these pics. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I don't know how to preface this other than I couldn't choose a right spoiler tag because I don't know what this falls under but I am only on ASOS and Season 5 right now so I'd like to not be spoiled on anything that's not this topic please?

So I'm new to the whole fan theory thing but I heard about this a while back and never really got it.

So apparently Rhaegar, Dany's brother, had a child with Lyanna Stark after raping her before his timely death.

Then Lyanna speaks to Ned about something that is never spoke out loud and only Ned knows and has to keep a promise.

Then the honorable Ned Stark, the man who dies without questioning his honor, beds another woman. (supposedly of course.)

Ned shows up with a son and a dead sister who was raped before her death and has one promise+secret to keep.

Then at no point ever says the name of the woman he slept with. 

Even though it's not written on paper.. It's pretty set in stone that Jon Snow is in fact Jon Strark/Targaryen right?

And if so. He is then the nephew of Dany? Which if they are both in fact alive in the later books could somehow end up meeting? He stands valiantly at the wall as always defending it from all sorts. Winter comes. Dany shows up all Dragonriding and shit to save the wall from destruction as Stannis did.

Which could in some cases lead to a romance without them knowing or even if they knew (somehow?) because Targaryen's kept it in the family right?

Although. Wouldn't the fact Jon got burned fighting the walker in ACOK(?) make him not-so fire proof? Although I've heard talk that Dany herself is not 100% immune to fire and had some kind of special occasion thing?

I know some of this is poorly written (most of it really.) but I had to get it off my chest and discuss it.

And once again. Please, I understand it says SPOILERS ALL but if Jon is dead already, please don't tell me. Just leave the post with no replies. Thank you. *I'm on Season 5 and starting ASOS: Blood and Gold.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So over the last few years I've really come to love a good lovestory or on screen romance with strong chemistry.

You know. Jon and Ygritte. Andy and April. Ted and Robin. Leslie and Ben.

There are a few others from shows but I don't remember the characters name but.

One tree hill. Lucas and the blonde. Then Lucas and Sophia Bush's character. Then anything about Sophia finding someone. 

Oliver and Felicity. Oliver and Laurel. Barry and Iris. 

Emily and her long time guy friend from Revenge. The ex cop, boat owner guy.

So is there any other shows out there that have a strong love arc that isn't just there because the higher ups want it to have a lovestory.

I really should have asked for show names with the couples... Never have I seen more names without context in my life. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I knew Daredevil was going for a darker approach to Marvel but damn this is fucking dark. Episodes 1-4 spoilers only! (Ps. it turns into an early review towards the end.) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-11 03:59:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm 4 episodes in (starting the 5th) and I'm loving this show..

When you think DC you think gritty, dark and a bass heavy soundtrack.

When you think Marvel you think fun, family friendly and an epic soundtrack. .. Actually, I don't think of the soundtrack when I think of Marvel so I guess I need to revisit those movies (apart from Guardians of course.)

So when it came to Daredevil being a dark show I just thought they'd show some blood and violence... This motherfucker just spent a solid 15-20 seconds on screen slamming a mans skull with a car door until it splattered and dropped from the side.

Then the bowling scene when he broke that arm.

I made this post revolving around the violence but I just had to say I love this show so far. I haven't heard of the Matt actor before this but I'll be looking for his work when I'm done. I don't know of Floggy (they don't say his name much, that's it right?) but he's doing a fine job of being comedic relief. I'm not sure what they're doing with Deborah Ann Woll's character just yet. I thought she'd be constantly around the guys and playing the early seasons Laurel role from Arrow. You know, knowing the guys but just being there for dialogue and the occasional fetch quest. But she's turning out to have her entire own story which is interesting. Then Clare. She seems to be setting up for a romantic role but I'm not sure exactly because I'm new to DD but I also don't want to know. I'd just like to see more Floggy. The show is doing a damn fine job of making every character feel important. We get Matt being Matt. Matt being DD. Deborah's character on her quest for justice through journalism and detective work. You even have the backstory to that guy she's working with, how he has the woman in the hospital (although it's very brief.). We then see a lot of the villains in work.

+That joke about him having an iron suit or magic hammer... Golden.

Love to hear your thoughts on the series up this far but please don't go past 4. I can't have this series ruined for me like House of Cards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I just finished episode one of the Netflix series and I'm really, really impressed but I knew I would be because I both love comic shows and Netflix shows.

So that aside. What exactly makes him a superhero? 

From what I understand he was trained to fight and has hearing beyond measure and I guess is some version of sonar? But what else is there? I learned that he can tell if someone is lying by the pace of the heart which is fucking awesome btw. 

Is there anything else? I know there most likely is but what is it?

Also, it seems to me that rain to daredevil is like the earth to superman. It's their chosen place to fight. At least I think so? right? Having the constant water pouring down on to the surrounding objects for his mind to map out.

Then I have to ask, I don't know the villain of the show yet except he's not allowed to be named by his workers but apart from this guy. How many villains can there be? Like I guess he's going to fight this villain throughout season 1 and beat him at the end (which I don't want to know if he does or not). So if they follow that formula, how many plausible seasons can there be? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I am pretty new to the Witcher series. I read some of the story for 1 and played about 8 hours of 2. I understand that is nothing but I need a strong reason to turn on my 360 instead of my pc.

So in saying that I've been doing my best to keep up with Witcher 3 as I process through 2. 

They announced that to complete the entire game it would take 200+ hours. A 60 dollar game with 200+ hours of base content sounds like a dream right?

Then they announced the DLC packs that open up an entire new area of the world and some gripping story. The first one should take about 10 hours. The second pack will then include 20 hours of content and entire new area of the map because (I'm paraphrasing) "when getting new content for a game we, as gamers want it to mean something to the story".

Now don't get me wrong, it could still turn out to be Unity upon release but I doubt it.

Love to hear your thoughts on the matter.

EDIT: I found the quotes.

-With the development of Wild Hunt coming to an end, the team has embarked upon the creation of two new really big adventures set in The Witcher universe, 

We remember the time when add-on disks truly expanded games by delivering meaningful content. As gamers, wed like to bring that back. Weve said in the past that if we ever decide to release paid content, it will be vast in size and represent real value for the money. Both our expansions offer more hours of gameplay than quite a few standalone games out there.  </TEXT>

I know a tiny bit about Scientology and that Tom Cruise is a big deal in it but I thought it was just a bunch of crazy people worshiping something dumb that has only recently come to light....

It's not at all like that. One man who wrote a lot tried to evade taxes and in doing so has created one of the most well known and hated cults of all time. That's what it is. It's a cult, not a religion.

The shit they tell us about in that doc... The baby facility... The daughter who disconnected from her mother... It's all just fucking disgusting. 

They are a non-profit religion and have racked up billions of dollars... How does this happen? What has to happen for the IRS to somehow revoke those tax rights and make it officially a cult or anything but a religion?

It's just... Fuck Scientology.

	<TITLE> TIFU by ordering games from G2A. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-03 03:48:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this actually goes back a couple months.

I started ordering games off G2A a few months back when I seen a youtuber pick it up and advertise it. It seemed easy enough. They seemed secure. It was cheap. Where was the wrong in this?

Well... About a week ago I went to order something online, my card got declined. I knew the money was on the card so I was wondering what could be wrong. I went the bank machine. It showed the money but wouldn't allow me to take it. I then went to the post office and they would let me take it so I just thought card flaw.

Then today I got paid again, tried it and it still failed so I called my bank..

The second I got on to someone and told them I need a new card they stopped me "sir we need you to confirm a few payments or transactions you might since the 12th of March. 

I expected nothing of it. The first 15 or so transactions were me.. Then she said something that wasn't. I don't know what it was but it was for like 12 dollars (and I'm in Ireland. We're Euro here.) [oh and Ps. everything got declined so I'm fine, kind of?]

Then she kept going.. There were honestly a good 30-40 attempts at my card all in the US and it ranged from 3 dollars at Bestbuy to 2000 dollars on American Airway or whatever the airline is. I wrote it down as she called it out.. If the transactions went through and I had the type of money they spent. I'd have lost upwards of 12-13 thousand. 

I get paid 160 euro a week. I can't quite imagine losing this amount of cash so to anyone out there looking to buy games. No matter what you see that points you towards it or whoever tells you it's fine. IT'S NOT. 

Stick to Steam, Xbox, PSN, Origin, whatever your base game store is. Just don't buy from these. 

And for anyone wondering why I blame them. I don't use my card often. I use it in my local store for shopping. My xbox live sub and the occasional game on sale. I haven't bought a game off Steam or Origin in about a year and even then, could I blame them? Then Riot. 

So I may be naive in thinking those legit companies are giving away my bank details but when you put the names in a list G2A come last. 

Fuck you g2a. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> He plays the creepy vibe great but I have to give it to the writers.. He has some stunning fucking dialogue. 

First was the Breaking Bad thing. He is talking about his masterpiece, his mona lisa, his Breaking Bad season 5.. Some people won't like it but I got a chuckle..

But then when he opens up and admits to the kid that's they share blood.. I knew where it was going. I wanted it to go there. I was hoping it would go there... It went there. 

"I am your father." Thank you CW. Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tried to think of some but... 

Godfather had a bad 2nd or 3rd movie right?

Matrix went to shambles after the 3rd release (although 1 and maybe 2 are great as stand alone movies or a 2 piece)

Jurassic Park had a truly awful 2nd or 3rd right?

Maybe... Just maybe... You could say the original Star Wars (4-6 that is). But I've never been a big fan and even then, were they as well rounded and epic as LOTR? Maybe I could put them as equals I guess. 

I need some opinions. I'm not too well versed on Star Wars and I'm pretty biased with anything LOTR so I'd honestly love to here your argument for any trilogy really. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-03-30 03:26:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So after 2 years of release (I think?) I finally decided to sit down and watch this movie. I've had the intention to do it but tonight I felt down even though I just got a loan of my grandad's camera (canon eos 400d for anyone who knows cameras. i don't..).

So I knew this movie was supposedly great to look at.. And by god what an understatement that is. At first its kind of odd how he jumped through the building and whatever but once you get adjusted to his little daydreams it becomes fun to watch (that fight scene over Mr Stretch). 

But... I'm honestly trying to come with words but I can't.

If you haven't seen it, please do. It's just breathtaking. Interesting story, pretty great Ben Stiller performance, very interesting take on a love story, Sean Penn is pretty hilarious and touching for what? 5-10 minutes of screen time. The soundtrack was quite fitting too. Loved it. 

All in all... On my messed up version of a 1-10 system I'd give this a solid 8.5 or 9.

A downvote within 60 seconds of it being up... Interesting take on an opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played both a while back and enjoyed both but I'm not sure which I preferred.

As someone who has never played much Halo I have to ask you guys. Which one is more populated? What has the bigger variety in terms of weapons, customization, maps.

I should add in I've played the 4's story but not Reach's although i know how it ends.... 

TIL: Asking for help in deciding between 2 Halo's somehow makes its way to keep your money for an xbox one and mcc.

I have 15 bucks and no interest in saving for a one.. I just need help choosing a game.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I watched Interstellar on my monitor a few nights back and as odd as it is to watch it on a monitor after seeing it twice in cinema I enjoyed it. 

But because my cinema doesn't do IMAX I didn't get, or at least I didn't notice any aspect ratio changes. Now I have sadly never witnessed IMAX so I don't even know if it would change for that but I guess it would because it did on the version I watched a few days back.. 

And it was a a joy to watch. How it went from normal version with Cooper talking to Murph and then as he leaves it pans into fullscreen.. It was quite gorgeous for lack of a better word.

So after rambling about nothing interesting for a few moments I'm basically asking if there are any other movies that do it to such a degree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I was just looking through an old box and came across the fellowship's ps2 game.

I can't remember anything about it other than it was too hard for me as a child. So in saying that.. Is it good? I really can't remember anything at all about it. Loot stystem, open world, character selection. I remember none of it. 

So those of you that remember it.. Is it worth breaking out the ps2 to give it a go again. (which is a lot harder than it sounds because my ps2 is in a house about 3 hours away...) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why should I go VIP? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-27 01:13:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I enjoy F2P games but.. I love a game that gives me an option to buy what I choose and not over do it like most Cod's, Ea games and a lot of other F2P games.

So VIP.. Right now I'm not in the best spot for money so getting something like Moria, Rohan, any of the other expansions is a no go.

And I should add in, I am pretty new to the game. I had a 13 hunter but got bored of it because I main hunter on WoW but now I'm trying both Lore Keeper and Burglar although I haven't looked into the classes VIP unlock.

So it's been about a day or so since I've read exactly what I get but I know about the 100xp boost, no gold cap, 500TP a month and all the classes/races. So what expansions do I get exactly? Would I get Rohan for as long as I am subbed or are there only certain dlc's?

VIP's help me ;-; </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So it's a class I've never taken any interest in because I just connected it to Rogues in WoW. 

But then I was playing my hunter today and I something like this in chat:

Guy 1: Why do you keep running around burglar'ing instead of levelling up with the rest of us?

Guy 2 (the burglar): Why would I hurry up the levelling system instead of enjoying the world of the burglar.

Like.. What does this mean? Have I been wrong in connecting the classes across games. Is this something different? Any help would be appreciated. And ps, burglar'ing is not a word it was just being used a lot so I picked up it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have been reading the books for the first time but when I'm not reading it I'm watching the show, but slow enough so the show doesn't pass the books of course.

So in the show towards the end of season 2 Robb finds Tulisa (that's her name right?) and they get married and everything by early season 3. 

In the books however. Robb just shows up about 150 pages in and introduces Cat to Jeynne Westerling. 

Is this the first time we meet the character in the book or has the show blurred out a past mention of her? 

Also.. Within the introduction to her I'm already more fond of her than I was of Tulisa just because I never really thought of her as a queen and because we met no family she seemed uninteresting in some way but I'm a fan of Jeynne so far..

As much as you can be for an oathbreaking marriage..  </TEXT>
