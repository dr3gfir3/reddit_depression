	<TEXT> He has majority in both house and Senate so he has no excuse for his failures. 

And he hasn't reached out to democrats or offered them anything. He basically goes *I'm going to pass a bunch of typical republican policies that hurt 99% of the people including your constituents. I will not bargain or compromise support me.* then he gets mad when he gets no support. It is like me saying *I'm going to rob all your stuff, beat you up, and rape your wife and daughters if you have any. In return I'll spit on you. Give me a chance. What you want wont? How dare you!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had faith in Republicans for a long time but I cant anymore. They have had bad faith in America and any type of opposition to their extremism since Reagan. For about 3 decades we tried to reconcile with them but they refused everytime. Republicans cant even agree with each other or treat each other in good faith. 

It is depressing. There is no alternative. You can continue to hope the Republicans change but the fact is they wont. We need a party like the Republicans were before they went insane, but the party needs to collapse first before we can have a sane conservative party.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really, checks and balances isnt really a hallmark of the Republican party. They are for checks and balances only if they are not in power, where then they are for negating the whole agenda of the whole other party. When they are in power they wish US was a dictatorship. 

There is a big disparity in both parites in that Republicans have become very extremist and corrupt where they view anything they dont approve of as unamerican and will try to stop it even if it involves hurting America and democracy. 

Also most Republicans really dont think they are making the right decision for America. They usually are making decision to help themselves, although often voting Republican hurts them, or they are voting based off angry. Republican voters generally only want to help out other Republican voters, although the opposite happens. The Republicans themselves only want to help the rich.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol, sure 1 sub despite you even admitting it wasnt just 1. 

Like I said I dont care if you follow me around defending Trump. I actually support it since offending trumpets and altright idiots is kinda my goal. However, since I am not a Trumpet I will warn you first you wont have a good time. I will. Dont say I didnt warn you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, yes every anti-Trump post is ridiculous to you. You showing up in all my Trump post in many different Reddits, every time to defend Trump, is clearly not stalking or you defending Trump. Seems like I triggered you snowflake. And for the record I dont care. Feel free to follow me around defending trump but it is going to be a bad experience for you.  </TEXT>

Ive pissed off many a trumpet in my days but none of them has stalked me like you. You are only slightly better than the triggered Trumpet lady from the video.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, did that trigger or something snowflake? I gave a list of reasons. Them being fat, dumb, and ugly is only a small part of being a Trump supporter, although these are important to supporting Trump. 

Why are you even on this sub. You are going to several threads I made expressing your butthurt that people dont like Trump. 

This dumb trumpet in the video thought America was her safe space now that Trump was president but the poor snowflake melted. Fuck her for being a bigot and stupid.  </TEXT>
