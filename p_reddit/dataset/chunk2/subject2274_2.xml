	<TEXT> A friend suggested it may have started [smoldering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smouldering) , which moves slower and at lower heat than flame combustion.
Then, maybe the bark is less sensitive to smoldering so the burnt advances more in depth than in surface. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lightning could explain how the fire started (although it would be weird that it would start so low, since lightning hits trees on the top and the top was healthy). But more importantly, lightning doesn't explain the weird shape of the burnt region or the precise boundary between burnt and unburnt regions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Above that, the tree was normal and healthy-looking.

Yes, it was definitely burnt. </TEXT>
