	<TEXT> The deeper we go into the final episodes, and the more brutal the stakes, the less graphic the on-screen violence has become.  It's all emotional gore now.

Declan and his crew?  Killed off-screen, audio only.
Gomez?  Death not seen.
Hank?  Cut-away just as the fatal shot is fired.  Even the shot to his leg isn't shown.
Jesse's latest brutal beating?  We only see the aftermath.

The most graphic bloodletting we see is Skyler cutting Walt with the butcher knife.  Because it's the most personal and emotional.
