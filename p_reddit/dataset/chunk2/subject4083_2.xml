But it was happening regardless of how fast I as going.  Or, it didn't understeer if I took every turn really slowly.  That's why I agreed with that poster that I probably should have calibrated my controller.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Diners have commitment issues, it seems.

The places I routinely return to do one of several things:

1 Act like they care.  Even trendy and hip places that drop the pretense and just act like they're your friend after you've come by a few times goes a long way.  First time I ever ate at Uchiko it was my and my wife's anniversary.  Tyson Cole was there that night, over heard us talking about it, introduced himself, and made us a few things off menu.  "We're thinking of adding this to our menu, what do you think?"  

The sushi place we frequent the most is pretty good but nothing ground breaking.  But the night my wife gave birth she wanted sushi and this place was right behind the hospital.  I walk in and they see the admittance bracelet on my arm.  "Oh another one of these guys!"  They congratulated me with a free drink and comped a few things on my bill.  Now we stop by two, maybe three, times a month and it's fun to joke around with the guys and gals who helped me relax and laugh after a very stressful 24 hours.

2 Have *real* stuff on the menu.  My favorite Thai place?  It has trendy fusion stuff.  But it also has real deal unadulterated stuff like ground pork sauteed in it's own blood + shrimp paste + fish sauce.  And it's served in a trendy way but it's still a fully authentic dish.  It's like the drink Fernet.  I take a shot, don't like it, and then a week later start finding myself thinking about it and then I go back and get it again, until it's something I like and eat without making a face every time.

3 Amazing god damned food for an amazing god damned price.  Back in my home town in the deep south this Vietnamese place opened up.  Sandwiches were four bucks, they baked their own bread, and the restaurant was a dude running the register and the 65 year old 80 pound grandmother in the kitchen.  Service was slow as fuck but they were such a quaint couple and the food was so god damned good that it didn't matter, we went all the time.  We just called in ahead.




There are plenty of places that are 5/5 and fantastic experiences that I will only go to one time.  I'm impressed with all the wild shit people are doing with pork face now days, but only so many restaurants can have that on their menu before they all start running together. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I left a 3/5 Yelp review for a restaurant. They PM'd me, want to send me a gift cert and invited me to ask for them directly next time I visit. What do? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-04 04:46:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was not scathing in my review.  My problem with them is slow dinner service.  Lunch service is always reasonably timely and the food has been great every visit. 

Been to dinner service 3 times, each a Friday night.  First two times it was slower than I am generally okay with but not a deal breaker.  Last visit, however, it took approximately 30 minutes to get our first round, almost an hour for our apps, and then another 30 minutes for our entree.  All in all, a table of six was there for almost three hours.  

Still not a deal breaker as we'll be back.  But maybe not for dinner service.  And that's why I mainly posted the review, some folks just don't have time for three hours + travel time some nights.

I was not scathing and mentioned the food was great every visit, listed my favorite options.

So they asked if I thought it was a problem with FOH or kitchen.  I let them know that a table of four next to us had similar timing, and a table of two received slightly quicker service.

I don't want a gift cert as I didn't write the review to "extort" one out of them, and if I do go back for dinner service and things are better I'll make sure to update.  I certainly don't want to meet a manager or have them dote over me either and they got better things to do than to babysit me.  I know they'd like me to change the review and I will if my next experience is better.

Should I ignore the last PM?  Should I tell them thanks but no thanks?  Should I suck it up and accept their graciousness?  Should I just delete the review?  

I do certainly appreciate them at least making the effort of wanting to improve their service.

Those seasoned chef slash entrepreneurs should consider fronting the money for a few Subway and Cracker Barrel locations to supplement their places that serve pork fat "noodles" with carrot and activated almond puree instead of opening up places that just compete with themselves.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Talking with someone earlier today, who seems to know their stuff, they advised to not believe the fud you see regarding the 991 versus the 997.2 (worse handling, mainly).

But I've also seen people compare the torque curves to both.  I don't know what the 991's torque looks like at @ 4400 on it's climb to 5600.  997.2's peak torque was 288 @ 4400, 991.1 is 287 @ 5600.

Just curious if the issue with the 997.2's torque peaking and then bottoming out was addressed with the 991.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a teenager and making $4.25 an hour I never cared for a car.  I needed a vehicle that was cheap and long lasting "because vehicles are tools to get me to work and back".  

The Prius would have been a great tool back then.  

And now I need a tool for baby duty and long commutes where I have to deal with things like GPS, a talkative wife, a crying baby that needs to be changed, diaper bags and luggage.

The Prius is a good tool here as well.

That said I'm looking to trade it for a CX-9 if one pops up for a great price.   </TEXT>

They're generally more expensive than the equivalent coupe going by what I see on the Porsche finder.

I want a cab because I've always had a convertible of one type of the other, except for the past 6 or 7 years or so.  It was something I always enjoyed having and taking one out on the weekend is a "simple pleasure".

It's something I've missed and now that things are stable it's something I'd like to pick up again.  So why not do it with a Porsche?

	<TEXT>  What year is your c300? 

Born on date of April 2015.

The only major MB problems I know of are the 2007-2008 engine problems with the S Class/CL Class and the wrist pin problems with the 2.0 liter 4 cylinder 2015 C 300. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Have you owned a Mercedes, if you have did you have any major issues?

C300 and  C43 Cabrio.

C300 has a slightly lazy transmission when in sport+, but that's just the transmission and not particularly a problem.  I think if you have the new 9 speed you avoid that.  Also, the solenoid that shifts/clicks into park/drive is loud.  Some issues with the interior as well and the C300's stock stereo system is obviously made for old men to listen to talk radio.  

I'm one of the lucky ones who has a C300 before they neutured the hard shifts in sport+ mode.

Haven't had the C43 long enough to know of any outstanding issues and it may get traded for a GLC43 Coupe.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, same platform.

The way I always read it/hear it is that if you take a German car and get it's maintenance preformed at the proper intervals you'll be able to make it last.

That said, someone posted a link on this sub not long ago that rated the top 10 engines currently on the market and the C 300's engine was on it.

The M274 platform has been out there for quite some time, since at least MY 2012.  Other than wrist pin problems for early 2015 cars 2.0 liter variant, I haven't heard of any significant issues.

Insurance is a wild card.  My C43 insured the same as my wife's Prius and we have full coverage on all three of our vehicles (the other being a C300).  So it could also be a situation where we get a discount for more vehicles.   </TEXT>

This is the same policy for Barley Swine.  No deposit, only a cancellation fee.  It's more "generous" than French Laundry since they only have a 24 hour heads up request.  

This is the same policy for Uchi, Uchiko, Lonesome Dove, Wu Chow, Fixe, etc.  The only difference is party size and cancellation time.   </TEXT>

So I wanted to buy a Mazda but Mazda wouldn't sell me one.  


I know they won't deploy a boxer engine, but if they could do something to compete with the 86 I'd be interested.  Gimme North of 250 HP and a Turbo please. </TEXT>
