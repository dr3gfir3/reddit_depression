	<TITLE> What's wrong with Aatrox? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> He's not a very popular champion and, even though his winrates are around 49~51%, it feels really unrewarding to play with him. His kit is ok, but it's pretty weak compared to other champions right now. 

You want sustain? Get vlad. You want to all in the other team and kill everyone? Riven and Irelia are there. You want to get extremely tanky and be the front line and still manage to survive the most bloody fights? Renekton and Ryze says hi.

It's about time we've seen Aatrox being played in queue (or even in normal games) and I really believe that he deserves some tweaks such as the upcoming ones with GP.

	<TITLE> After the last patch, the icons of the active items are extremely confusing! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-28 21:27:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before this last patch, people could just glance the inventory to see if their items were ready to use, but right now, we often see ourselves trying to use the active items even though they won't work. Why? 

Riot changed the way these items are being displayed (or maybe just a bug?). Now when they are in cooldown, it's almost impossible to just glance and know if they are ready, simply because they keep bright when in cooldown, and this causes a lot of gamechanging mistakes, unfortunately. 

I know there is a new HUD coming out, but that doesn't mean we should ignore this.

	<TEXT> When I mean owned items, I mean the bar right below the shop screen, where you carry your items.
So lets say, I have one potion or ward and want to buy 3 more of them, let me just right click over it to purchase instead of having to search them in the items tab.

	<TITLE> Really Frustrating Issue about Howling Abyss </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-12 12:40:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Howling Abyss shop area is too short, and I think I'm not the only one who complain whenever I take a small step outside from that small place and then can't buy anything. Due to the fact that you cannot return to it to shop again after leaving, it just makes things more frustating. Could Riot increase it just a little bit further? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is the problem of having a full target-ability champion?
If everyone is provided with skillshots the game will lose diversity and will look like a firework's rift.
I feel that Riot is always trying to make different champion concepts, lore and gameplay but in the actual game they all feel the same. 
Let's look at Lee Sin and see why he's so fun to play:

- He's not "cc and kill confirmed" type of champerino. 

- Versatile, skills have different uses

- Mechanically unique

They should innovate in terms of mechanics for the next releases or try different kinds of cc's. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> An important thing that few people noticed about Ekko's abilities </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-11 19:38:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't think many people realized that the video about Ekko fighting with "Urgot" can tell us more about the champion itself then we thought. 
Notice how Riot wants to let it clear that, even when going back in time, Ekko still keeps damaged. If you see in the video, he takes a stomp on his arm, and when activating the time mechanism, he still hold his left arm feeling the pain.

So technically in the Rift, the ability of going back a few seconds will probably take you to the last spot you where, but your health will keep the same if you take damage from anything.

	<TEXT> Maybe a champion that would be able to have an gravity field around him that would slow your enemies depending on the weight/tankiness of their items. And by slowing I mean reducing drastically movement speed, attack speed so he would be tough against bruisers. 
Since he's a gravity based champion, his skills could work with %hp and get better while he builds ap.
