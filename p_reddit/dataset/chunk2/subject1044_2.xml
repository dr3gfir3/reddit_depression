	<TEXT> I am back of house, but yes, this is completely why. Same goes for the meal. It doesn't matter if you order 2 meals, or 1 that we turn into 2. It takes as long as making 2. Top it off that I work in Portland, Maine. Have you ever been to Commercial in July? Busy is in understatement. We're cramming in all our business into 3 months, and you wanna pay for a $17 meal 8 different ways. GTFO.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't work in fast food, but have worked in the restaurant industry for roughly half my life... People who order one meal to share, ask for it split on 2 plates, and then modify each side... Screw you. They usually pay on 2 credit cards also, to really stick it to you.  </TEXT>
