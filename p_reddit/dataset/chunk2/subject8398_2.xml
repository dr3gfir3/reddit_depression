	<TEXT> I don't think it's about the query letter itself so much as who the query is addressed to. Some agents won't take science fiction, no matter how good it is, because they just don't care about the genre. A quick Google search can bring up what a specific agent is looking for. It'll be on their agency website, an agency listing, an interview, and so on. If the writer queried an agent without knowing what they represented, it would show the writer didn't do their research. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my writer's group, one lady submitted a novel that had a scene with Chinese thugs. I'm the only Chinese-American (or hell, the only non-WASP) of the group and immediately I noticed that there were Korean surnames mixed in with Chinese surnames, Chinese pet names mixed with formal names, and the characters spoke in ridiculous sentences like "I am sorry I arrived late, I have many dreams in the night." 

I pointed out that no one talked like that, if you're going to have characters speak in another language then at least don't make up fake exotic speech patterns--this isn't the Dothraki it's a real group of people with real languages. Anyway, it's surprising how dense some people can be when writing about other groups so I understand the need for sensitivity readers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be young adult supernatural. Lots of books cross genres.

But it would be a tough sell, because your young adult novel features a supernatural romance, and yet the main character is male. It is hard to tell if your targeted audience is teen girls or teen boys. Teen boys would be turned off because of the girly aspects (not to mention they get turned off from reading anything not in graphic novel/comic format in general) and teen girls will be turned off when it's following a male protagonist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only writers that pay the agents good money are the ones who can sell many, many copies of their book. For that to happen the writer has to prove they are professional, dedicated, and that they understand the market. If someone writes a mass email "Dear Agent" it shows they are such a novice that they have no idea what they are doing. Agents get so much of that that they won't take it seriously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found the pasted examples to be okay, but when I checked out the agent's full twitter I did see some unnecessarily snarky tweets that mocked the writer anonymously.

That being said, it is interesting to see why agents reject books. Sometimes honestly is helpful. I think the best piece of advice I've ever read on a literary agent's site was, "If the premise has already been done before and done better, then we're not interested." I think that says a lot about how the publishing market is a market like any other, and if you don't offer something that fills a niche then they won't be interested. </TEXT>

Basically my parents know I have dated: 1 mainland Chinese software engineer, 1 Asian-American post-college student with Hong Kong parents, 1 college student who was half Thai half white, 1 white college student, 1 Hispanic college student, and one white guy who worked part time customer service. Race hasn't really been an issue so much as stuff like the guy's socio-economic status. My mom didn't like the Hispanic guy even though he was so nice to her and did all sorts of favors for her around the house. She thought he talked too much and hated the fact he was 2 years younger than me. Dad hated the mainland Chinese guy because he was convinced anyone Mainland Chinese who was interested in me MUST be after a greencard because I am not pretty (dad's words). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lets look at elephants, because it's actually happening to them.

Most elephants have tusks. Once in a while an elephant is born missing tusks The way some babies are born missing arms or legs.

Then came poachers. Poachers started killing off elephants with tusks to get ivory. They kill elephants in the thousands. All those young elephants therefore did not get to live long enough to mate and pass on their genes. Nowadays a large percentage of elephants do not have tusks because the ones that died were killed off.

As for humans, that happened too with smallpox. Smallpox was rampant in Europe several hundred years ago, and when all the other people died from it, the lucky few who were immune passed on their genes. That's why they accidentally wiped out most of the Native Americans, who lived far from one another and didn't have the chance to do that. </TEXT>

Think of Me from Phantom. By the way I notice that if I listen to it with earphones my voice jets out really shrill every so often but no shrillness when I play it open audio. Sometimes when I sing my high notes sound shrill to my own ears, I wonder if they sound shrill to people around me.

	<TEXT> Hold on. How long did you talk to him before you invited him over? I re-read your post and it sounds like you'd met him on a Saturday, left him alone in your apartment on a Monday, and that's what happened. If it all happened over the course of 2 days I could see how you got scammed (invited a guy who was always a thief, he's alone in an apartment with sweet stuff, he jacks it all). If it happened over a longer period of time it wouldn't make sense for him to be manipulative because it just wouldn't be worth anyone's time to catfish a regular person who could be just as broke as them, you know?

Personally I wouldn't invite someone over to my house at all for the first couple dates because they could easily be a rapist/murderer. I'd have to know them for a while to get a vibe for whether or not I'd let them into my place. Then even longer before I'd let them have the key to the place.

I'm sorry you had to learn that the hard way, but as long as you take more precautions you can avoid it in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can get better as long as you have a good ear. I read Pavarotti's biography and he said that his father had a remarkable voice and that everyone who knew him said he had gotten his voice from his dad, but the dad just didn't have a good ear to tell whether he was off pitch or not. Pavarotti DID have the ear, as well as an outgoing personality (that dad got stagefright easily), so that's why Pavarotti became a famous opera singer while his dad was a baker who only sung as a hobby.

Also I definitely feel an improvement compared to when I started lessons 2 months ago. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Thinking of publishing under a pseudonym, anyone done it before? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-12 19:41:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Maybe I am getting a little ahead of myself, but I wrote a novel and submitted it to a couple literary agents and one has asked for my full manuscript. So now I am in the waiting period, not getting my hopes up too much but crossing my fingers.

I think that in the scenario that she does choose to represent me, I would like to publish under a pseudonym because the book is about a girl with abusive immigrant parents who dealt with depression as an adult because of it, and it is pretty much just a fictionalized version of my own life and family problems. I made lots of changes like parents' occupation, names, made up fictional friends to play interactions off of, but the core of the story is there.

So I need to chose a name that can't be mistaken for my real name, but 1) has to reflect my ethnic background and 2) I can't simply assign myself a stranger's name I have no connection to.

 I was thinking the pseudonym should be the main character's name, to mimick an autobiography since that is pretty much what it is. I don't know if that is allowed though. Other option is to pick a random first name I don't feel any connection to and use my mom's (very common) maiden name as a last name.

Anyone have experience in these sorts of things?

The fact he didn't even read enough (of books in general) for us to even have a discussion meant a huge part of our conversations just weren't intellectually stimulating.

	<TEXT> Don't worry, I don't see you as a slut. I don't even see Monica Lewinsky as a slut. Just young and naive.

But here is the thing: you are the one getting screwed over, not him. He already has a family, and he is having fun on the side too. You, on the other hand, are the one who is getting screwed over because you are spending your time with invested in him and not someone else.

If things go sour, he can just pretend it never happened. You, on the other hand, could lose your job. This is a man who is clearly a bad husband, so ask yourself why you want someone when if you had him you know he would cheat on you with someone else. His wife is someone that he had, probably not even that long ago, wanted to marry.

If his wife doesn't know about the fair then he is obviously lying to her, and this is a woman he once loved. So ask yourself, wouldn't he do that to you? So many girls before you have been in your exact position, we all want to think we are the rare exception but the fact of the matter is that this guy isn't even making the effort to work on his marriage to a woman he had proposed to and has children with. </TEXT>

I had gotten my first Christmas bonus, walked into a store that said Store Closing - Everything Must Go!

I saw a beautiful leather recliner, but jumped back when the owner said it was $800. He then said it was half off, and if I bought it that day it would be $350 with free delivery. The sudden drop in price excited me so much I bought it.

Then several months llater I walked by the store and it was still open, same "everything must go" signs. I realized it was a fake sale and they had it like that just to trick someone like me :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It kills creativity. Great things come from creative minds expanding on each other. Look at Greek mythology, so many people expanded on each others' stories to create epic stories that span multiple generations per family tree. People like Shakespeare borrowed elements from all sorts of old mythology/history, same goes for a more modern example like Harry Potter.

Now thanks to Disney we pretty much don't have original fiction after the Wizard of Oz era/Alice in Wonderland era. </TEXT>

See, that's the thing. You don't think writing is important. To you it's just a hobby, to me it's not. I actually have published a ton of nonfiction (was a freelance writer for a big website at one point) but I never asked him to read that because that wasn't important to me. I don't think I ever told him about it. Writing fiction is different, you build your own world, you choose your own characters, it really gets inside your head. </TEXT>

After Spring Break...

"I will read it next weekend!"

Etc. Anyway it would have taken 2 hours to read and he had plenty of free time. I said if he didn't like it he could just tell me, and he kept insisting it was great and that he was ~saving~ it. After 9 months I asked myself why I was trying to get him to read a manuscript when something I felt so strongly about meant so little to him that we clearly had a very superficial relationship. Anyway that was a year and a half ago and I recently got my first book published, albeit the publisher is insignificantly small. </TEXT>

But I didn't so much see it as normalizing abuse (there at least is no physical child abuse in the movie, I don't remember there being any in the book) so much as just forcing a cheesey ending.

The book definitely has its flaws but since I read it at a very young age when there was little Asian-American fiction it did have a positive impact on me in a sense of letting me know I wasn't the only one hurting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I related to June/Waverly rivalry so hard. SO hard. Especially the piano scene. God I hated the piano.

It wouldn't say it normalized abuse to me so much as it taught me I wasn't alone...that at least Amy Tan related to my situation. Although I only cared about June and Waverly, the other two daughters were completely unnecessary and only seemed there because 4 mother/daughter combos sounded more conceptually interesting than 2.

I get why Amy Tan seemed so anti-men, she said her father was abusive and she was raised by a single mom, something that I can relate to. My dad was a violent alcoholic and the only man in my life, so as a kid I remembered hating men and wondering why they had to exist. My opinion has drastically changed since then, but having a shitty father in an immigrant household definitely has an impact on you so I get why it made its way into Amy Tan's book--because that's the only world she knew.

The mom storylines were a bit melodramatic. Fun story but it was an odd combination of very realistic settings for the daughters and soap opera settings for the mothers. 

Overall I enjoyed reading her books when I was a teen. I did notice her Chinese wasn't very good though, she mixed Shanghainese words with Mandarin and didnt know the pinyin system. But perhaps that has changed - I saw a more recent interview she did in the past few years and she seems a lot more aware of Chinese culture now. </TEXT>
