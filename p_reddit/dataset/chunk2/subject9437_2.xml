	<TEXT> LOL! I really think what the cleric meant is if the person performing ablution intentionally positions an ant in the water, then Allah will not accept it; if it was there unintentionally, then it is fine. 

I literally can't stop laughing at the stupidity of this. A very petty question gets a detailed "ruling on insects in ablution water". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was a question on an Islamic Q A website. The cleric is asked whether an ant that got into the water used to perform partial ablution for Muslim prayer would make the water ritually impure and therefore invalidate the ablution. The cleric replies back with a lengthy discussion about whether Allah will accept his wudu. It turns out, according to the cleric, that this is the case only if the ant got there unintentionally and not on purpose.

I just thought the question was quite funny and trivial. Religion can make people obsessive about trivial things.  </TEXT>

TRANSLATION:  Cleric is asked whether an ant that got into the water used to perform partial ablution for Muslim prayer would make the water ritually impure and therefore invalidate the ablution. The cleric replies back with a lengthy discussion about whether Allah will accept his wudu. It turns out, according to the cleric, that this is the case only if the ant got there unintentionally and not on purpose.

Essence of sharing this is to show how religion can make people really narrow-minded.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, what was the point of your original post asking me to obey their laws when I did? Huh.

And, then you said, I should stop ranting. It is absolutely no concern of yours what I say and what I do. Again, you are calling me a bigot because I criticised the effects of religion. I am really starting to think that you are another butthurt religious nutter.  

Even if you are in the US, you are disrespecting your own country's laws when you ask me to stop ranting about something. You obviously did not want me to express my views. 

Now, could you just shut up you little whiny bitch. I'm sick and tired of talking to people like you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you stupid idiot, Saudi Arabia's constitution is the Quran. Article 1 of Saudi Arabia's Basic Law of Governance states that the "constitution is Almighty God's book, the Holy Quran, and the Sunna (Traditions) of the Prophet". 

Again like a fucker, you are taking my words out of context. I said you cannot deny the fact that there are Muslims who want Islamic domination. And, they are actually good people too because they believe that what they are doing is righteous and that these acts are good because it says so in the Quran. The reason why I alluded to those statistics is to show what religion can do to good normal people and how it can make good people do bad things. That was the purpose of my quoting those stats. 

"No, you didn't. What you said is that Muslims don't respect other people's laws and alluded to the Islamic takeover of the Earth. Like a nutter butter." again more stupid bullshit you are spouting, you stupid rascal. I never said Muslims don't respect other people's laws I was talking about the minority again to show what religion does to people. My original  post was about Saudi Arabia and how they disrespect people's laws. For example, Egypt, which I have also been to, respects Non-Muslims and their right to worship. They have churches and synagogues, etc and it is a Muslim country. The essence of me quoting the minority of Muslims was about religion and not those people themselves. Again, I said they are good people who have been brainwashed by religion to do something bad and consider it as a good deed. 

Again, you are accusing me of making up this story when I am prepared to swear that this is exactly what happened to me in Saudi Arabia!! I don't care whether you believe it or not. As a matter of fact, you can go fuck yourself. 

And actually, what's your problem you pathetic loser? Ok..For the sake of your stupid and embarrassing argument, yes I actually did obey their laws you motherfucker. I did pray when they told me to. And, I did leave the mall when they asked me to. Now I'm here in Canada and I'm free to criticise them all I want. I have the right to criticise them in this great country of mine. I am protected by the country's freedom of speech laws. Now you are disrespecting Canada's laws by asking me to stop ranting and criticising what they do. And by doing so, you are also disrespecting my country. I am free to criticise their flogging of Non-Muslims and their unlawful imprisonment of innocent people, and rant about it all I want.  So, what is your problem you stupid idiot? Even my Saudi friends who live here in Canada would agree with what I say and with my criticizing their nonsense. What the fuck is your problem?!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What the fuck?! No. You basically said that a Non-muslim visitor to Saudi Arabia should obey their laws. Which means that -- for a non-muslim worshiping peacefully (and even privately) over there and getting arrested afterwards, it is actually their problem and they should respect that and accept whatever punishment that might ensue. Saudi Arabia's constitution is the Quran. That is their law and constitution. So, when you say "Obey they're laws", you are basically saying that non-Muslims visiting there should convert to Islam because Saudi Arabia's constitution says so. The Quran says that people should follow Islam. 

I did not say all Muslims are bad. Now you are the one who is putting words in my mouth. I said that the majority is always irrelevant. It is the minority which always commits the terrorist attacks. The "individual scope" is always the problem. It is the individuals who commit the attacks. What I am trying to say is that this should not be ignored. Your argument about peaceful Muslims l is irrelevant and has nothing to do with my original point. 

Yes I was talking about Muslims when I quoted this stats. But what I meant is they harbor these views because of the authoritarian structures within Islam. You have good people doing something bad and thinking that it's good because of the religion is ordering them to kill blasphemers and convert people to Islam. Muslims take the Quran literally unlike Christians; you stupid idiot. So, they believe everything the Quran has to say and follow it word for word. 

I am certainly not lying about this!! How infantile, disrespectful, and stupid of you to say so! Just go to Saudi Arabia and see for yourself. Scour the internet; you will find hundreds of similar stories. Double check everything I said in my story; you will find that others have experienced similar incidents. Go ahead; you don't have to believe me. Why would I care? And, why would I even lie about my location you stupid idiot? Yes I do live in Canada and I don't have to prove it to you. 

Since you made up stuff about me. I am going to speculate that  that you are a butt-hurt Saudi hiding behind a fake profile and incensed because I defamed your country. 

Good luck if you ever happen to visit Saudi Arabia. And Good luck if you are not a Muslim. Don't come back to us asking for help since we have to respect their laws. Put yourself in the position of hundreds innocent migrant workers in Saudi Arabia who broke no laws and obeyed them but are still in jail and are being tortured for no reason; they would be so offended by your terrible statements. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always wondered the same. I think their stupid reasoning is that they have an excuse because in doing so, they are "spreading the word of God" and "doing good deeds" by making people pray.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no problems with Muslims having a place of worship, halal restaurants, etc...but why is it that you think that Non-Muslims should not be accorded the same rights in Muslim countries? Why do you think only Muslims should have this privilege and that Non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia being arrested for worshipping (even when in private) should go fuck themselves and that they should be respectful of Saudi Arabia's laws?! I don't think the hundreds of innocent prisoners being tortured in Saudi Arabia would agree with you that the West should turn a blind eye and respect Saudi's laws. Do you think that when William Sampson, an innocent Westerner, who was tortured for 2 years and was on death row would have agreed with you that Britain should not have intervened on his behalf because Saudi laws should be respected. This is someone who was completely innocent, did not break any laws, but yet was sentenced to death. Read his story here: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/saudiarabia-humanrights. He says his case is among thousands of others. How can anyone not speak out against this?! Why should we be such acquiescent fools because of Saudi Arabia's so-called "sacred laws"?! 

Did you even read my comment well? I said "1 in 5 US (or about 300,000) Muslims agrees that violence should be used to enforce Sharia law". Google it and see for yourself. They think blasphemy should be treated by violence as was the case with the Charlie Hebdo massacre. 

I live in Canada and Muslims are respected and they celebrate their festivals all they want and they do whatever they please (things which I have absolutely no problem with). However, look at what happens to Non-muslims when they go to countries like Saudi Arabia, they are lashed if they practise their faith; do you think they should respect this? Why do you think it is Ok for Muslims to worship their God but Non-Muslims should not and should obey Saudi laws?! Your reasoning is quite flawed. 

It is very dishonest of you to use a word like Islamophobia because Islam is not a race. You are confusing my criticism of Islamic authoritarianism with hatred of Muslims. People like you who keep calling others Islamophobic are themselves phobic of criticism of Islamic idealogy. So you have nothing better to do than hurl libelous statements at me. 

And by the way, I know very well what the Saudi National curriculum teaches because I have friends who used to live in Saudi Arabia and were raised there. The religion books teach young kids that Non-Muslims should be hated and that Islam will take over the world because that is the will of God. The sermons at the mosques are replete of derogatory terms towards Non-Muslims such as "pigs" and "monkeys". And, you cannot deny the fact that there are Muslims who want Islamic domination. This is not a generalization. You can google the stats and see for yourself. I don't care what the majority thinks or if the majority is "peaceful". The majority is always inapplicable. It certainly was inapplicable when the 9/11 attacks occurred. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, do you think we should be respectful of their laws when they sentence a blogger to 10 years in jail and 1000 lashes just because he setup a website calling for reform? Do you think we should be respectful of Muslim laws when many Muslims do not respect our own laws? They come here to our country and they want to enforce Sharia law. 1 in 5 US (or about 300,000) Muslims agrees that violence should be used to enforce Sharia law   51 percent agree that Muslims should be governed according to Sharia law. Also, 40 percent of UK Muslims have been polled as saying that they want Sharia law to be enforced in the UK. And, about 1/3 of UK Muslims believe apostasy should be punishable by death. Why should we be respectful of their laws when they hate ours? 

Edit: I have no idea what this Gizortnik guy wants. What he is basically saying is that Non-Muslims going to Saudi Arabia should obey their laws which means they should also convert to Islam since Saudi Arabia's constitution is the Quran. But for the sake of his embarrassing argument, I did obey their stupid laws. I prayed when they told me to and I left the mall when they asked me to. Now I'm here in Canada and I'm free to criticise them for their contemptible actions as much as I want. I am protected by my country's freedom of speech laws and he should respect my country's laws and not ask me to stop ranting. 

He accuses me of being an Islamophobic bigot because I mentioned some stats about Muslims who agree with using violence to enforce Sharia law. What I meant when I used these stats was to criticise authoritarian Islamic idealogy and provide an example of how religion can brainwash good people and make them do bad things thinking that they are actually good "because God said so". He is yet another example of standard dishonesty by people who keep throwing around the "Islamophobic" label flippantly when they feel incensed due to criticism of Islamic totalitarianism; so they just resort to labels like "Islamophobic" and "bigot". 

He then accuses me of making this whole story up, when I am prepared to swear that this is exactly what happened to me in Saudi Arabia, word for word!! So, not only did he accuse me of bigotry but also of lying, just because I am criticising Saudi Arabia's religious police and their heinous crimes. Why is he so infuriated by what I said about the Saudi religious police that he is prepared to make unsubstantiated accusations about me? Is he a Saudi or something hiding behind a fake profile and enraged because I am denouncing his country's laws?  </TEXT>
