	<TEXT> This distribution can be really helpful if you want to check the legitimacy of certain documents. It is called Benford's law. There is a probability distribution that represents the likelihood of any number showing up. For example, 1 has a probability of 30.1% while 9 has a probability of 4.6%. The expected value of this distribution is 3.441. If you want more information, here is the link to the Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law#Mathematical_statement </TEXT>
