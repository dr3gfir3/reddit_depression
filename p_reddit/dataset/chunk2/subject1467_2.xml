No you are not pointing out where it is stupid, you are just saying it is stupid and hoping that throwing enough crap will cover for your inability to make a cogent argument.

	<TEXT>  You get blamed for slavery because you fought a war to try and keep it then spent 100 years denying blacms equal rights
 
Really? I did that? No, saying that white blue collar males fought for slavery then who was fighting against it? White blue collar males that is who. My family fought on the union side. Your assumptions are just off the charts.
 
 
 You get told mass immigration doesn't affect jobs because it doesn't. The macroeconomic effects driving down wages aren't related to day laborers and farm hands. Immigrants are here because blue collar workers didn't want to pick grapes.
 
I corrected some of your punctuation, you are welcome.

And no you are wrong again, I do not get my info from some study written by some professor that has never worked off campus, I get my information from seeing factories that used to be majority English speaking where anyone from other cultures would be welcome, change into majority Spanish speaking factories where anyone that is not Spanish speaking is treated like a leper and ostracized from all socializing and from seeing firsthand how many of the building trades are having their wages held down by a steady influx of immigrants from Mexico. Most people moving here are fine people and I do not blame them for doing what they have to do to feed their families but it is absurd to pretend this issue effects blue collar and university educated people the same. 

Also your statement that " Immigrants are here because blue collar workers didn't want to pick grapes." is implicitly racist, you are assuming that the only job Mexicans are capable of is field labor which is untrue, they want the best jobs they can perform. 
 
 The SJW boogieman at most says "recognize being a white guy makes it harder to see what problens minorities have". If you take equal rights as an assault on your person, thats on you
 
I did not criticize people for working for equal rights, I criticized them for spewing hatred toward people because of their race, class and gender which is a huge part of that segment of "progressive" thought that is common among people  called SJWs  if you are unable to tell the difference lurk more.  
 
 Idk man still seems like you dont have a leg to stand on

No actually I do, if fact much of your post proves my point that lefty prejudice against white male blue collar workers is a real thing and explains why so many will vote for an orange buffoon. 

Face facts, you are part of the problem.

	<TEXT> A huge part of how things got to this state is that when you talk about "liberals" in the US you are almost always talking about university educated people.

 If you are an uneducated white blue collar male and you listen to the left you are going to be on the receiving end of constant vitriol and hate directed at "ignorant rednecks" and "hillbillies".

 We get blamed for slavery, which mostly benefited the rich and educated, we are told if mass latin American immigration does not affect educated classes negatively then it does not matter if it lowers our wages and restricts our job opportunities and if we want our voices heard on the subject we get called racist.

 As well as listening to a never ending stream of "Hate, hate, hate the white male" from the more loony SJWs.

Is it really any wonder that folks like this would reject everything about the left and follow Trump? What other choice do they have? It is like a drowning man clutching at straws.

	<TEXT> aztlanists believe that the southwestern part of the United States which we took from Mexico in a war a century and a half ago will always be Mexico and was once part of a great Aztec empire and that people that move here from Mexico have a greater right to live here than non-Mexican people that were born here. Plus an unhealthy commitment to victimhood as a part of cultural pride and a belief that anyone that does well in school and advances through their own initiative is "trying to act white". It was a big deal in the eighties and nineties but most Mexicans in the US today pretty much reject it as being a permanent victim of society does not pay very well or make you many friends. </TEXT>

Now we are bitches for every scheming grifter and the courts order us to bend over and take it with no lube. It is time to put the Lord back in landlord and teach these damn tenants their place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was younger I encountered a similar situation and broke a thick twig from a tree, cut a point on one end, split the tip with my pocket knife, cut a wedge to hold the ends apart and ate my meal with my rustic fork.

Try that today and you might never see daylight again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The pink pistols are cool, I have seen them on Calguns website although it has been a while since I have been there. They are especially useful in my opinion as outreach to conservatives as there is nothing like hanging out with someone who just happens to be gay, doing an activity you both enjoy to get people cool with gays. I wonder if a gay gun group is more accepted by liberals or conservatives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think your reading comprehension needs work. When I say that "Most people that hold progressive ideas about race and gender are more or less reasonable" I am not talking about the campus loony tunes that your twitter link is describing, Those idiots are just a small and mock-worthy segment of the population. I am talking about the large percentage of Americans that get along with blacks and gays who would not mind working with a woman and think others should be treated based upon their character rather than their category. an idea that the "Es Jay Dubya" crowd has turned on its head. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to work in a factory in my city, when I started it was staffed by men and women from many different cultural backgrounds. During my time there I worked with people from all over and we got along pretty well.

 Once Mexicans became the majority things changed, they stopped speaking English unless they were talking to a boss and kept a loud conversation going at all times all in Spanish. If you could not speak Spanish they would exclude you and talk about you openly in a language you could not reply in.

 It changed from a place where anyone from anywhere could work and be one of the team to a place with an in-group and an out group. I tried talking with one of the more socially active lead workers and told her it would be friendlier if she could speak English some of the time. She loudly told me "This is Mexico!"

A week later she got angry at me and turned around and started loudly saying crap about me in Spanish in a horrible tone of voice to the rest of the room which went absolutely silent while she tore into me saying I know not what. It was humiliating in a way I cannot describe.

After that one of the bosses asked why I look so sad all the time and I said, without naming anyone, that they talk about me in a language I cannot understand and it hurt me. He told another boss who told the lead I was having trouble with who started telling as many stories as she could to the second boss, he called me into his office and gave me an angry chewing out, asked me to quit and threatened to fire me.

I eventually quit but on my own terms at a time of my choosing after the second boss got fired for being useless. The angry lead person is now in his position.

I usually keep this to myself as folks with a progressive viewpoint tend to assume I had to be at fault and I have had people demand that I reveal the name of this factory and act like they have proven some great point when I will not name it but I live in a small city and do not need to get dragged through the mud again.

The reason why this went so bad was it was the eighties and there was a huge amount of very toxic aztlanist latino activism going on in my state so I do not think the same situation would happen today.   </TEXT>
