	<TEXT> I would love to hear about why some of you are learning Vietnamese. For those living in Vietnam, how much do you think learning the language has actually benefited you in the country? I'd also love to hear from those outside of Vietnam (like myself).

I wrote a blog post about my own answer and would love to hear from others on the same subject.

	<TEXT> This may be true, I don't know, and I don't have an opinion on dog meat, but I was only really addressing the part where he implied that all meat is the same morally. I think that each type of animal should be taken as its own case. As long as the criteria that you use is consistent in your own decision making, then I don't think it is hypocritical.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Taking a more general look at it, I do not believe it is hypocritical at all to criticise someone else's meat choice when you yourself eat meat. For example, I would be critical of a person or culture that farmed and ate Chimpanzees, but not chickens. This is because I believe that a chimpanzee has a higher level of self awareness and higher capacity for emotional distress than that of a chicken. For this reason, I do not believe that "meat is meat". 

Similar arguments could be made for dogs (although I do not personally have an opinion on it). Regardless of where you draw the line at meat eating (and I think most of us do draw a line somewhere), I don't think it's hypocritical to do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, there's a whole compilation album of songs recorded in Saigon around 1968-1974 during the war, called "Saigon Rock and Soul", it's all great. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL833E925721802958 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The English language is such a tangled mess of inconsistencies, irregularities, weird pronunciations, and other baffling features. It has been argued that you could spell the word "fish" as "ghoti".

"gh", pronounced [f] as in tough [tf];

"o", pronounced [] as in women [wmn]; and

"ti", pronounced [] as in nation [nen].

You can try and go through and sort out all these quirks, but doing so would create a drastically different language. There is no governing body over the English language. Language evolves naturally. Attempts to artificially dictate how people *should* use the language are generally ignored.

The English language as we know it, with its "C"s, "X"s and "Q"s won't disappear. I'm not going to start changing how I go about spelling words at this point in my life. At most you would create an alternative version of the language. If anything this will make learning the language more confusing, as you will have to learn two versions of the language. Consider how much existing material is already written in English with the letters that you wish to remove.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that would a pretty common response and one that I agree with, but I don't understand specifically what you mean by "there should be no sympathy". Especially when everyone takes those risks in their life. This hypothetical person just had bad luck with this specific risk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But you said "there should be no sympathy for them". What does that mean? If I hear that one of my friends died in a diving accident, what do you think I should feel about that? Should I just think, "well a good person died doing what he loved, but it doesn't matter because he knew there was a slight risk involved so it's his own fault". It's a very strange way to view the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Life is never without risk. You take risks when you drive a car, drink alcohol, cross a road, go on holiday, climb a mountain, swim with sharks, eat unhealthy food. Everyone individually decides what risks are worth taking in their own lives and which ones are not. If you are not passionate about mountain climbing, then it's not a risk worth taking for you. I enjoy SCUBA diving occasionally. I am aware that there is risk of death. I do it responsibly and as safely as I can. 

You can reduce the risk in your life massively by staying in your house, only eating healthy food, never making unnecessary journeys, never leaving your comfort zone. But I would say this runs a bigger risk, the risk of wasting your life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Althought there certainly is plenty of nostalgia going on, I do disagree. Toy Story was one of my favourite films as a kid, and Toy Story 3 met and exceeded any expectations I could have had. It did to me as an adult what the first one did as a child, and more so. I think it's the best of the 3. </TEXT>
