	<TEXT> For me it's this two Scenes [first](https://youtu.be/ewNLCkA0oBk) and [second](https://youtu.be/iucB3X-P2C8) from  Modern Times. I remember laughing about the Slapstick in the Movie (still to this day)  when I was a kid, but now days see all the political statements that are made in this Movie, that are still relevant in our time. It's a great masterpiece that withstood time. What about you guys? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! I totally agree with you.  There goes so much thought in one Scene in every detail and then everything gets ruined when the actor don't speak his native tongue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone! Love this Subreddit and this awesome Community of Movie Lovers. I am a little bit off an outsider from my Friends, because most of them don't want to watch movies with me in their OV. I live in Germany and not all Movies get realesed in their OV in the Cinemas. I think that there is so must lost when a Film or Series get  dubbed. I mean that for all languages! Really like to hear your Opinions. </TEXT>
