	<TEXT> Pretty close, but you've missed a few bits. Blood (the dog) can talk because he was a Pre-apocalypse military experiment in enhancing canine intelligence with technology; Vic is basically a feral child and Blood is trying to educate him  - mathematics, history etc - for their mutual survival benefits. So basically, the man-dog survival equation is reversed.

Also, you missed out on the best line. After they eat the girlfriend, Blood, lying contentedly on his back, says, "You know, she was tougher than she looked!" Credits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I'm not sure on the distinction between "would be better" and "should play him", but I disagree with you entirely on the tough guy thing. It's hardly a rich literary masterpiece, but much of the point of MacLeod is that he's an ordinary guy who has immortality thrust on him (there's a whole scene where he asks Ramirez "why me?"). It has good points and bad points, but it's mainly a curse - he's almost burnt at the stake, he buries everyone he loves, and we see him go through various stages of dissolution in the flashbacks.

The tough guy is the Kurgan, who is also much of the reason MacLeod stays alive - to prevent the Kurgan from taking the Prize and to exact his revenge for the rape and murder of Heather. (The rest of the reason is that he thinks the Prize will give him a mortal life at last.)

MacLeod is a competent swordsman because Ramirez teaches him. But it's skill and smarts, not toughness.

I have not seen Tristan and Isolde, and I'm not doubting Franco's acting prowess (27 Hours was brilliant and he was brilliant in it). I just think he's too likeable to play a thousand-year-old, world-weary, slightly paranoid immortal with a revenge fixation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Irish accent? Have you actually seen "Highlander"? Quite apart from the Highlands being in Scotland, the original Connor MacLeod ("M'cloud") was played by Frenchman Christopher (Christophe) Lambert. And then there's this bit of dialogue:

COP: You talk funny, Nash. Where you from?
MACLEOD: Lots of different places.

But anyway, two problems with your suggestions. One, MacLeod has been alive for a thousand years and carries the weight of all the questionable things he's seen and done. Franco would be perfectly capable of carrying the role, but he's too much of a nice guy. There needs to be some ambiguity there.

Two, he's not a tough guy. He's an ordinary Joe and the runt of his litter (a disappointment to his family before they find out he's immortal). Hemsworth in Thor mode is completely wrong.

I think someone in the Reynolds-Norton-Bale continuum is spot on both physically and in terms of acting chops, and I look forward to them doing something more human with the character in the reboot than they did in any of the laughable sequels or in the schlocky TV series. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the first point is that Blade Runner's negative reviews were often about the fact that so many questions were unanswered (the is-Deckard-a-replicant thing comes to mind but I believe that was later), not just because it was presenting scifi in a new frame.

For that you're maybe thinking of Alien's truckers-in-space compared to the squeaky-clean square jaws in jumpsuits of most of scifi cinema's history up to that point.

As for pointing you to the plates - well, are you considering that this is not the final chapter? Scott has all but announced another film (following Shaw and David to the Engineers' home world) and there have been rumours of Prometheus being the first part of a trilogy. So maybe expecting all of the answers now is premature. Instead, read some of the discussions around how Shaw compares to Ripley, whether Vickers is an android, the differences in the way the mutagen works in different contexts etc etc etc. There's a lot of stuff that it's interesting to think about.

Everyone has their own point of view. And it's fun to discuss them. Without arguing, of course.

For example, I find it interesting that everyone accepts that the vases are WMDs intended to wipe out earth. In fact, it's only Janek who puts this idea forward as his interpretation. Could be something completely different. Everybody just takes it as read, but Scott is perfectly capable of using a bit of misdirection.

I also like to think about David's shifting motivations. It's easy to write him off as utterly loyal to Weyland and his programming, but he's pretty much the centre of the film and probably the most likeable character (we're supposed to feel sorry for him when Holloway and Weyland insult him). So when he appears to be cruel or emotionless or selfish - what if that's hinting at more complexity rather than just being bad writing? Is there a framework where his seeming cruelty to Shaw on the diagnostic table fits in with his android nature? How exactly would an artificial intelligence with an "understanding" of emotion view organic life? Is he capable of jealousy? 

Where Roy Batty and the Replicants of Blade Runner are children in grown bodies, and Ash is the Company Man in robot form, David can be seen as Weyland's adolescent son. How does that inform his doping Holloway's champagne?

Interesting, no? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry that this argument irks you, but I didn't say that it was because Prometheus and Blade Runner are by the same director; I said that it's because they both have the same kind of ambiguity-on-first-viewing that leads to a lot of discussion and repeat viewing and that that then reveals a vivid, rich and internally consistent fictional world.

And that's not including the obvious thematic connections (both are about characters trying to reach their maker because they want more life). So no. Not "just" because it's the same director. Scott's three scifi films are very intimately linked.

Some people just want everything wrapped up nicely and handed to them on a WYSIWYG plate. Others want some more depth and actually LIKE discussing different interpretations of that ambiguity. If you're part of the former group, maybe just realising that other people are discussing something they are interested in without actually trying to argue with you (instead of getting "irked" or "bugged") might go a long way.

Now if you're not turned on by discussions of why Scott treats his android characters in Alien, Blade Runner and Prometheus as if they were more emotionally complex than his human ones; or how in all three films he plays with gender roles, rape imagery and perversion of procreation/parenthood/development; or how characters  in all three films seek to manipulate and are manipulated by a faceless corporation, even those who think they are calling the shots ... Well, maybe you could just recognise that people who are see Prometheus as more engaging than you found it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP, you make the point over and over again that you're disappointed that Prometheus "didn't explain anything." What exactly would you have liked it to explain?

Various people have posted here saying that the point is that it DOESN'T answer many of the questions that it raises, and that is WHY there is so much discussion about it.

Incidentally, many of the same accusations were levelled at Blade Runner (released 30 years ago today). It was panned by critics but is now considered a classic, in both cases precisely because of the seeming ambiguity which is layered on top of a rich, vividly realised and internally consistent fictional world.

Also, in both Blade Runner and Prometheus, part of the attraction is not WHAT happens, but HOW it is shown. Both films have fantastic cinematography and attention-to-detail in the set design, costume, effects and mise-en-scene which are all too rare in scifi cinema. 

Perhaps some people like it because it is beautiful piece of film-making. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it's just you ;-P

Seriously, some of the best gameplay I've had is when I'm outnumbered, playing against a team of ridiculously high level Colonels and I'm trying to defend on a bajillion ticket rush map - because when they kill me, that's expected, ... but every kill I get back is a real victory.

Sure they'll beat me, but I won't make it easy, and maybe we'll have some cool stories to tell afterwards.

	<TEXT> Hi brother. A lot of people have been focusing on the "penis" part of this, but I'd like to focus on the "depression" part. I experience the same self-hatred around my own reasons. Fortunately for me, my bouts of depression - although very intense and regular - are very short-lived (about a week every six or eight weeks). I feel for you having a long period of depression. That must be so hard.

For me, when I am depressed, my Practice goes out the window. When you hate yourself, it's very difficult to find the energy to try to improve yourself, and when your mind is filled with that, there's not much room for anything else.

I find that it helps me to identify the depression as something that happens to me, not something that defines me. I know that when I'm depressed I say and do things that I would never do or say outside of the depression - it's like a different person is living my life. I almost think of it like being a werewolf or the Hulk or something (not really, but it can be a helpful concept to help me step back a bit). When people say "I'm sorry I did/said that - I wasn't feeling myself", I think that's what they're getting at.

For me, dealing with this side of my life started with recognising that it was a problem. That helped me start to "accept" that I was struggling with depression (rather than "suffering from" it) and that it was okay for me to have this problem - it doesn't make me weak or a bad person, it's just one of the things I have in my life, and everybody has something. It's good to see that's the stage you are at - you're on the right path.

Practice does help a lot ... if you can practice from inside the depression you're doing very well.

I would humbly suggest that you need to see a therapist (which you're doing) to help you work through the depressed thoughts, and you also need to see a medical doctor to make sure there isn't an easily-fixed hormonal or chemical side to it (the depression part, I mean, but a doctor may be able to help you with your penis issue too).

In any case, I wish you strength and good fortune in dealing with this, and I will remember you in my own Practice. I hope this post in some way helps you realise you're not alone at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can see that this is going to be something I won't be able to rationally internalise from Reddit posts! 

I think part of the issue is language - we say "this happened to me," so that kind of pushes us towards seeing "me" as the subjective consciousness, thoughts-and-memories, or witness that experiences and remembers the event. I certainly see "me" as the witness/experiencer - not necessarily the thinker but the thing that experiences thinking.

If I understand you correctly, this experiencer is part of Me in the same way that my physical brain, endocrine system, sense organs etc. are also a part of Me. There is, presumably, another component which is the "life energy" previously mentioned.

I can see how reincarnating life energy + experiencer would be reincarnating Me, but I guess I need to meditate long and hard on grokking how reincarnating JUST the life energy relates to Me.

Thank you very much for your thoughts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is that facetious? Upvote anyway.

To answer your question, it's a self-referential system so being aware of being aware of being aware is the same as being aware of being aware...

Or to lift an analogy from Terry Pratchett, it's awareness all the way down. :-)

Or again, you could look at it like this: I am the thing that perceives my mind working. For "I think, therefore I am" to work, "I" have to be aware of thinking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for replying!

Well, no I am not my body. I have a body, but I am not it. I could imagine having a different body, but I could not imagine having a different me. I can rationally think, "Why am I in this body and not yours?" but it is meaningless to think, "why am I me and not you?"

(The whole all-your-atoms-are-different thing, by the way, strikes me as being as empty as Theseus' Ship (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus). I get the point about impermanence, but that's not the same as denying continuity. And although the material components of my body may all have been replaced, it is still by definition, my body.)

I totally understand that I am a noob at this and maybe shouldn't expect to get my head around things straightaway, but I find reincarnation explained as some nebulous "life energy" being reused is about as meaningful as saying the water in my cells will be reused so therefore my cells are immortal. That's water (life energy) being indestructible, not my cells (self) being reincarnated.

In my current world view, my self is the most fundamental identity. All phenomena are divisible into two categories: me and not-me. I understand rationally the concept of interconnectedness with respect to the simultaneity of cause and effect, etc., but that's still me being connected to not-me. And when me dies and the life energy and component atoms which powered me and made up me's body are reconfigured into a new life, that new life belongs to not-me.

I'm not sure if I'm even making any sense any more...  </TEXT>
