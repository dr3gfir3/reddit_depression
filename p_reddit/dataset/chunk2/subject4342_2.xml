[Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger USB A to C cable   Turbo Charger](http://imgur.com/a/KvF0t)

As I stated before, I don't use that Samsung A to C cable since I'm not sure if it's spec compliant. Just did this to show I wasn't lying about turbo charging from a USB A to C cable. With the right cable, it is possible. As for the charger, it's the stock one that has shipped with Samsung phones since the Note 4. The one I'm using now came with my S7 Edge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on the cable. I have a Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger. With the Choetech Type A to C cable I have, it would activate turbo charging on my old Moto Z Force. However, with the Z Play I now have, it does not activate turbo charging. However, if I use the Type A to C cable that was included with my Samsung T3 portable SSD, it does turbo charge the Z Play. I don't use that Samsung cable though since I'm not sure if it's USB-C spec compliant and the last thing I want is to fry my phone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've posted about it here a couple of times. Due to Moto Mod compatibility, back skins for either the Z or Z Force are compatible with the Z Play. Album links below for the ones I've used. Side skins won't work due to varying thickness and ports (headphone jack on Z Play), but front skins may work even though I haven't tried any.

	<DATE> 2016-11-27 13:40:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After receiving an email five days back that a refund request was submitted on my behalf, I got another email today stating "The compensation request has been approved and is being processed by the Accounting Department." They've had mine since Oct. 25 for a third-party return. 

If the last Samsung rep I talked to on the 21st is correct, he gave a rough estimate of receiving the refund by the second week of December. The previous rep before that on the 14th gave me a date of December 6. Also, the rep from Nov. 14 stated my return wasn't in the system and I needed to provide her my tracking number to prove it had arrived. The one from the 21st said mine started the process on Nov. 19. So it took almost a month for there to be some movement with my phone. At least now I can stop my weekly calls to Samsung for status updates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had plenty of LG and Samsung phones. The Z Play is a great device. I got it after returning my Note 7. Performance is great, the camera is better than I expected, and battery life is an obvious plus. I have yet to come close to draining the phone in one day. On previous phones, I would usually go around disabling a lot of features to conserve battery life, but not with this one. I can enjoy using all the features without needing to worry about  killing the battery. </TEXT>

Even though the front flash is on the opposite side on the Z Play, it's in the same place as the selfie camera on the Z/Z Force. If you do get it, I'd go for the regular Moto Z front skin since the Z Force's display is totally flat edge-to-edge, unlike the Z and Z Play. </TEXT>

I've had a great experience with them, but something like this just ruins that trust. 

I don't mind waiting. However, waiting and not knowing when I'll be getting that refund is not something I want. Now that the 14 business days have passed, we have nothing to go on and that's not right. </TEXT>

The customer rep mumbled something along the lines that it should have been done already since the 14th day had passed, but then she proceeded to count 5 regular days after it and continued to count 14 business days after those 5. She then came up with a random Dec. 6 date for when I should receive my refund. Instead of getting upset, I just let her talk since she clearly had no clue what she was doing. During the initial call that initiated my third party return, I (along with others) was told the refund by check would be issued within 10-14 business days. That time has clearly passed in my case. Gonna call again today and see how it goes. I've been a long time Samsung customer, but that will likely change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fees vary depending if you sell on eBay and Swappa. Since both use PayPal, they have their own 2.9% of sale price + $0.30 fee. eBay charges 10% of the final sale value (ridiculously high). Swappa used to charge a flat fee of $10 for each sale, but that changed this month, but it's still a lot more reasonable than eBay. I usually meet at the mall or a carrier store if I'm doing a Craigslist sale. I usually keep my loss below 30%. It just depends on the phone and how often retailers decide to put them on sale. If I initially  get a phone with discounts and gift cards I've earned through promotions, then I can often end up making more than what I initially paid.  </TEXT>

Just including smartphones since my first phone was a flip phone back in 2003. I'm pretty happy with the Z Play. Great performance and the battery life is the best I've ever experienced. :

* Moto Z Play
* Note 7 (2x)
* Galaxy S7
* Moto Z Force
* Moto X Pure Edition
* Nexus 6P
* GS7 Edge (2x)
* Nexus 5X (2x) 
* LG V10
* Note 5
* Galaxy S6
* LG G4 
* Nexus 6 (2x) 
* iPhone 6 Plus
* Note 4
* LG G3
* iPhone 5s
* Galaxy S5
* One M8
* Moto X Dev Edition
* LG G2
* Galaxy S4
* iPhone 5
* Nexus 4
* Galaxy S3
* HTC EVO 4g LTE
* Galaxy Nexus
* Galaxy Epic 4G Touch
* HTC EVO 3D
* Galaxy Epic 4G

Sadly, I have not kept any of these since I sell them after a while to offset the cost of the next phone. The phone I've kept around the longest has been the Nexus 6P (~ 8 months). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! A full coverage tempered glass is not possible on the Moto Z and Z Play. The glass is slightly curved along the edges (similar to 2.5D glass) and it's the reason why they leave a large gap of glass exposed along all four sides. On the other hand, the top plastic layer on the Z Force is flat and allows Pleson to offer this edge-to-edge option.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Accessories for the moto z play + a couple for the z force </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-01 16:09:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Decided to post this in case someone is in the market for some accessories. I have been staying away from cases lately, but I decided to get a couple for the Z Play through Verizon's BOGO deal. ~~My favorite of the two has to be the Incipio~~ (see update below). The color combination looks great and it has a nice soft matte finish. The Tech21 case is a tad bit wider and taller than the Incipio, but it is slightly thinner. Both work great with the stock charger and third-party cables. The fingerprint sensor also remains easy to use.

When I'm not using a case, I stick to a dbrand skin for the back. The one that is currently on the Z Play was previously on my Z Force, but since I sold the Force, I pulled it off and applied it to the other one. Works perfectly with it and remains Moto Mod compatible. There's also a matte black skin over the camera glass. For screen protection I use a Skinomi skin since I didn't like the tempered glass ones being cut short due to the slightly curved edges of the glass. It works well with the cases and doesn't affect the clarity of the screen. There is a slight orange peel effect when the screen is off, but it's not bad. On my Z Force I had the Pleson tempered glass. Some reviews have been negative about it, but mine turned out great and offered solid full screen coverage.

	<TEXT> I didn't directly come from the S7E, but I did own it earlier in the year. I got the Moto Z Play after returning my Note 7. Battery life shouldn't be a concern. I haven't even come close to draining the phone during the day. I don't play mobile games, but I do use it a lot and don't disable any services. I have yet to encounter any performance hiccups. For my usage, it has performed as well as the Moto Z Force I had prior to getting the Note 7.

Though the camera won't outperform the S7E, the one on the Moto Z Play has been remarkably good. I honestly didn't expect it. AnandTech even did some photo comparisons between the Z-line and the Z Play outperformed the regular Moto Z. 

The things I miss from Samsung are the camera app, multi-window (Nougat will fix that), and the phone's sexy build. Looking at the S7E never got old. Damn good looking phone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is because both Pixel phones have a slight curve (2.5D) along the edges. These make having an edge-to-edge tempered glass pretty much impossible without an air gap. Some companies get around this by adding colored border to the tempered glass, but all that does is hide the air gap. Others deal with it by cutting the tempered glass well short of the edges which leads to what you experienced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is rather odd. The two reps I talked to yesterday both said it was a Verizon decision based on the recall situation. The guy I talked to today (advanced support) seemed to be a bit more confident in how he talked about it and was surprised I got my line suspended. If Samsung is to blame, they definitely were too quick to do it. I have yet to receive the special return packaging. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Verizon Already Blacklisting Note 7? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-16 01:03:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I got a text this morning on my Verizon Note 7 that stated the following:

 This device is not authorized for use. Please activate another device or call 800-922-0204 or service will be suspended but billing will continue

I immediately went to check my IMEI and it is showing up as being blacklisted. As of right now, my service is still working. Before calling that number, decided to do an online chat. The following is a section from the chat:

 **rep** : This is a safety issue and they are canceling any users phone who is still using one. WE will credit your account back and you can upgrade to a new phone today
**You** : There is a store I can go to. I understand that it has been recalled, but my other device isn't scheduled to arrive until Monday. If I understand correctly, Verizon is blacklisting the Note 7?
**rep** : It is being blacklisted, we do want anything to happen to our customers who still use the device

I looked it up more and found the following [XDA link](http://forum.xda-developers.com/verizon-note-7/help/started-blocking-imei-samsung-carriers-t3480701) with someone else bringing up the same thing. The OP mentions it happened after providing Samsung his IMEI to process the return. I called on the 12th and provided the same info. I'm still waiting for the box to arrive. 

I ended up calling the number Verizon provided in the text. After a long wait, the rep pretty much told me the same thing the online one did. Something along the lines that Verizon will be be preventing Note 7 phones from working on the network to protect customers. Has anyone else here encountered the same thing? If not, did you process your return directly with Verizon and bypassed Samsung? It will be interesting to see if this is only occurring to people that provided Samsung with the IMEI for the return or if Verizon is indeed going to do this for all phones.

**EDIT 10/16** Woke up in the morning with service disconnected. I did an online chat to see if I can get service again, but that didn't work. The chat rep did leave a note on my account and I was given a number to call. Called the number and the rep was very helpful. Also seemed to be a phone enthusiast himself. Somehow my phone was put in the lost/stolen list, but he also brought up the safety concern blacklist thing the other two reps mentioned. However, this was slightly different since he mentioned that Verizon is blacklisting Note 7 phones if they're in another country. Since they can't be brought onto a plane, he says they're automatically being blocked. He was rather surprised to learn my phone was blocked, but he was able to remove it from the lost/stolen list. Even after this, he said I would need to activate another phone to get service back up. A few hours after the call go by and I decide to log back into Verizon to see if I can reconnect the line with my Note 7. Went through the process and it worked. Got service back running. Can't wait for this whole mess to be over :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With credit cards, they typically extend the manufacturers existing warranty. However, since LG doesn't provide warranty for the international model in the U.S., you're pretty much out of luck as far as warranty support goes. However, some credit cards do have a separate insurance feature where they'll pay for a replacement if it gets damaged or stolen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Z Play is the cheaper one. It sells for $409, but I got it through Moto for $348 before tax and with a free Incipio battery mod. The Moto Z's camera sensor is different (much older) than the one in the Z Force. I did a check and the Moto Z is using the same sensor that was used in the Nexus 6. Both the Z Force and Z Play are using newer, but different sensors. Actually, AnandTech did a photo comparison between them and both the Z Play and Z Force outperformed the regular Z. The Z Play was able to keep up with the Z Force for many shots, but the Force pulls ahead when it comes to low light conditions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you referring to the regular Moto Z or the Moto Z Play? I previously had the Moto Z and Z Force. The normal Moto Z is not worth it. The thing I hated most about it was the camera. The Z Force was excellent. Great display, solid camera, and was super snappy. I sold it right after getting the replacement Note 7. I didn't want to sell it, but it made no sense keeping both. Now I regret that choice. The Moto Z Play is currently on its way and should be here by Tuesday since it ships from China if ordered from Moto's site. Before I ordered, I was able to get some hands on time with one. Not enough to really give a decent comparison to the Note, but I feel like I will definitely enjoy using it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well worth the call. I told the first operator I got in contact with that I would be requesting a refund. She took down my info and asked where I got it from. She even brought up options like eBay and Craigslist, but I told her Swappa. Kinda surprised since I initially expected them to only accept carrier stores or Samsung.com orders. After that, I was transferred over to the Colorado center people have mentioned. That was a very long wait so don't lose hope if it takes over 40 minutes. The second operator took down my info again and asked for the IMEI. 

Once done, I was told I would be receiving the return packaging. I was also told that all accessories had to be returned with the phone. Doesn't bother me, but I'm sure there are some out there that won't like this. Whole call from the first operator to the second one lasted a little over an hour. </TEXT>
