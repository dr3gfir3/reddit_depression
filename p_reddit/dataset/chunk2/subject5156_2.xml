	<TEXT> In most cases, no, they aren't profitable. But you also said ignoring electricity costs. So if you're mining for free, everything is profit. I don't have much experience mining other algorithms. There's skein, which a lot of gpu miners seem to like, lower temperatures and power consumption. x11 is another one. If you're trying to get rich mining, you need an ASIC, pure and simple. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 80% of $200 is $160. That gives him $40 to spread among 10 different cryptos, as you recommended. 

While it's definitely a good idea to invest a majority of your money in bitcoin, I might say do 50% btc and spread the other $100 among ltc, doge, Myriad, vert, dark and monero. There are pretty big price differences among those 6 coins, ranging from ~$10 per coin to less than 1 cent per coin. Any of them have potential to increase in price, obviously some more than others. </TEXT>

How many miners are supported on 1 controller?
This is sometimes miner specific so mileage may vary. Larger miners tend to have more chips so the quantity of larger miners supported will be less than the total quantity of smaller miners supported.

I've never personally purchased from this site, but I have seen others on Reddit recommend it. You can use the coupon code "gaw25" to get $25 off a purchase of $200 or the code "retailme15" to get $15 off. Not sure what the minimum price is for the $15 off coupon.

The 1.3 ms/s Fury Scrypt miner for $109 is a pretty good deal, although the prices seem to drop every week or so. They also recommend buying a Zenminer controller, which is $70.

	<TEXT> The prospect of anyone mining four different algorithms on the same machine is so infinitesimal, it's laughable. And the thought that enough people would do this to successfully 51% attack myriadcoin is extremely remote. 

We're talking about a lot of hyptheticals with Myriadcoin, a lot of "what ifs" when there is currently a pool with the ability to 51% attack bitcoin, and just a few weeks ago the same thing happened to litecoin. Which coins are more resistant to 51% attacks, the ones who have already had pools with 51% of the hashrate, or the coin that people have to come up with very, very extreme cases that may result in a 51% attack? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, this is a forum for discussing crypto currencies, everything everyone says about their coin of choice could be misconstrued as "culty"

It's not like Myriad is a scam coin that we're trying to get people to invest in for a pump and dump. Just people legitimately excited about a coin that solves a lot of problems other coins seem to ignore. And the fact that Myriad is largely ignored by the wider crypto culture is annoying, especially when something like NeutrinoCoin can soar to #10 in marketcap and all of a sudden everyone's talking about yet another scam coin instead of coins with actual longevity. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I was mining over at muchdig.com since about January 28th. I was cpu mining, so wasn't making a ton of doge, but I got about 500 in 4 days. For the last 10 days or so though, we've been stuck on a block, and it looks like my payout will probably be minuscule. Just looking for some sympathy doge from anyone who feels my pain. All tips would be appreciated. Thank you all in advance. </TEXT>
