	<TEXT> My parents bought an NES to play, which I did enjoy playing Super Mario Bros. and Gyruss on. But I was more interested in other things than gaming, until I went to my aunt's and she had a PS1, and let me play Spyro: Year of the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot: Warped. Then the gaming began. </TEXT>
