	<TEXT> I have had an on/off relationship with a girl for about five years. 

In the beginning, she was really fucked up. She had been raped, she was on meth, and was suicidal. After a few months, I talked her into getting help and she got better. A lot better. She was in and out of relationships and would crash every time one would end, and I would be there for her. 

I was there for her when her friend got killed in a wreck. I was there when she was struggling with addiction. I was there when she was suicidal and depressed- sometimes I'd get calls at 3 am and would spend all night talking to her.  I gave her all I had in order to try and help her. Seemed to work. 

Recently, about a year ago, she told me she had shot up again. You have to understand, I knew this girl like no one else had. I had helped her through things you can't even imagine. I had been so invested that I myself had become depressed, to the point of being suicidal and apathetic because of what I saw and went through with her. Never abandoned her, even at the low points like that. It had been five years.

When she told me she took meth again, I snapped. Told her I couldn't handle that again, and that she needed to go to rehab and that I wasn't going to talk to her until she was clean again. She begged me not to go, played every card she could. Didn't care.  She got clean because of that, and is in college and doing well. I'd do it again in a split second. 

TL;DR- helped a girl get off of drugs by looking out for myself  </TEXT>

Caf Du Monde- Caf Au Lait and beignets. 

Mother's Restaurant- Roast Beef Po-Boy with Debris or the fried shrimp Po-Boy. 

Middendorf's- little ways out of Nola but well worth it. The catfish is legendary, and so is the shrimp Po-Boy. 

VooDoo Barbecue- amazing barbecue. The brisket is great and so is the Cajun sausage there.

	<TEXT> I got called a few months ago by my buddy. Apparently his muffler on his 198(ish) MR2 had fallen off. Long story short, we used a clothes hanger to keep the damn thing on.

Another time, same guy, was having engine problems and couldn't start up. So we grabbed some plywood from the back of my truck, put it in between my grille guard and his back bumper(he had a RX8 at the time) and I pushed him so he could pop the clutch and get going. Dented the fuck out of that bumper, but oh well. Car was a piece of shit anyway.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like the following:

Some sort of upgrade so I can run/jump. Preferably, I'd like to be able to jump on to  various rooftops from ground level. 

A jet pack/flight suit mod so I can just fly wherever the fuck I want. 

Super strength so I can move the cars of asshole drivers who park like shit and ruin it for people looking for a spot. Of course, if I had the previous modification I wouldn't need a car, but I'd still do it out of spite. 

A HUD for my eyes. So I can be redditing during class and for watching porn at home. No one would be the wiser. 

The equivalent of a utility knife in my fingers, but better. Say you need to weld something right quick, you think, and bam, there's a MOTHER FUCKING WELDER COMING OUT OF YOUR FINGER. Say you need to open a package- bam, there's a knife coming OUT OF YOUR HAND. It would be awesome. 

Finally, upgrade to my brain so my cognitive abilities could rival a computer. Studying is a drag. It'd be nice to be able to know everything about everything ever.  </TEXT>

Other than level of excitement, not really. Had some good conversation. She's going back home for the summer and we hinted at the idea of meeting up.

I really want to tell my parents and friends, but most of them are hardcore.. You know how it is. I have a hard time even acting Adventist at this point, pretty much go along with the wishes for a "happy sabbath" and numerous prayer periods in classes.. During the Chapels and Vespers I'm either working doing sound at PMC or on my phone just to get credit.. I'm not entirely against religion at this point, but I do oppose the Adventists for a number of reasons. I'm just afraid that if I do leave, I'll lose my job and the next few years here won't be pretty. Any advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it seems these days all potential girls are just teases. 

Had a girl at a Krispy Kreme flirt with me like she wanted me right there. Went back and asked her out and she turned me down because she had a boyfriend of "almost three years". 

After that I pretty much flirt with girls everywhere hoping one day I can get one drunk enough to agree to go out with me. 

I'm 20 and I've never even been on a date. Pretty pitiful state of affairs. 

I thought when I was younger college would be full of potential poon. How wrong I was.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry I didn't clarify. 

We sold the diesel because we were paying 200/mo for fuel and 500/mo for the note. 

We have a 32ft camper that we used to haul but we rent out a campsite for it year round now so the diesel outlived its practicality. 

Looking for something around $6k, that won't be too bad on fuel, but can still haul stuff around. I do a lot of tech work so I move heavy equipment a lot. 

I was thinking about an older (as in 1995-2004 ) silverado or dodge ram.  </TEXT>
