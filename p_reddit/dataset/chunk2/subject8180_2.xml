My PSN is reptil31066.

	<TITLE> Lens flare in Flash tutorial </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-15 22:39:55 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hey all,

I thought it would be a good idea to post on this subreddit after lurking around for a while and I was thinking why not start with some of my own content. I have a YouTube channel where I upload tutorials and stuff and this is one of them. I'm not sure what the rules about self promotion here are, but I wondered, being a community of animators, you might be able to help me out on deciding what I should upload. I animate almost every day, but am struggling to find ideas for what I upload, so yeah.
Anyway, enough of the bullshit, here's a lens flare tutorial I did a while back that has a nifty little trick about blend modes and some other things that may help you guys out. 

Thanks, and please do let me know if posting stuff like this is not allowed :S

I hope you enjoy, and any feedback whatsoever is greatly appreciated.

	<TITLE> Looking for space trader games similar to the late 'Space RPG' </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-24 23:09:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all, sadly to say, I've noticed that a long time favourite game of mine, Space RPG, has been removed from the Play Store, and I'm looking for a replacement. The key features I enjoyed were open world and hands-on gameplay with a virtual stick and fire buttons etc., and a focus on trading (preferably simple but it's not a necessity.) 

If you could provide me with any I would be incredibly grateful :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok.. Like you could categorise the skill of players based on a completion system, and instead of like level one, two etc. it could be a Higher tier or lower tier for that league.

To clarify;

When you are playing in multiplayer, there are separate leagues (you can rename them or whatever if you like :D) and when you enter that league, you play against other players also in that league, so everyone's on the same skill level. Once you have beaten that league, you advance to the next where there will be better players, presumably now at you level, and you do the same for the next etc... If you want upgrades, just let me know and I'll have a think about how it could happen (I mean upgrades like ball upgrades etc ) 


Just brainstorming, tell me if any of this isn't possible or anything!!  </TEXT>
