	<TITLE> Suggestion regarding teleportation </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-27 00:15:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ever since I started playing trove a bunch of months back, I've had this one thing poking me in the eye over and over again. And that is the teleportation system. The /joinme system is awesome. But what bothers me is the "You have to wait" thing.

There is no indication on how long you have wait, to begin with. Then, you get the cooldown even if the teleportation failed (such as "World full"). Or my biggest pet peeve - the fact that when you die and choose to return with E, you get a teleportation cooldown as well.

My suggestion is, remove it or at least put a timer on it so we know when we can use it again. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I got told that I'm triggering a friend of mine </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-19 15:13:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok, so a post I made on facebook sparked a privte discussion between me and a friend of mine. The person told me that the online diary entries I've made talking about my preferences when it comes to BDSM are triggering and sends out "warning signals". My diary entries regarding BDSM. On a BDSM forum. The whole purpose of the site/community is for people within the BDSM (and LGBT) community to have their own online community where they can discuss, meet new people, whatever you do on communities without being judged by other people for their sexual preferences.

Every persons own page includes a tab called "Kinks" where you can fill out a form on what things turns you on, what things that are a big nono and so on, so that people know what other people enjoy. The site also has pretty strict rules to ensure that people have a safe space.

The person told me that I seem like a bad person when I've posted entries containing fantasies I have/have had. Those include rape play fantasies in one entry as well as one entry where I briefly think about wether it's the act of violence or the dominating part that turns me on the most. And apparently, these things are "triggering". 

Myself, I've never really cared for trigger warnings when it comes to written text (as well as "Viewer discretion is advised!" on TV shows) but I can understand that some people prefer them.

But then again, I feel like if you visit a community which is based around BDSM, people are going to write about it. The person told me that the only reason they didn't contact me about it was because they "1. Didn't want to comment on it." "2. Hoped that I would improve my ways".

Sorry for being all confusing and so. I just wanted to ventilate and know if I'm the one who's wrong in this situation or not. What do you guys say? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been using your Chrome add-on for a while now and I love it. Because of it, I don't have to keep constant track of when games are etc.

But one thing that I would like is that the streams you are directed to when clicking "LIVE" shall be in english if there is an english stream available. Because, to be honest, most streams are in english and most people have english as their primary language when watching streams. 

Or even better, make it possible to choose from multiple streams if more than one language is available. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a pretty easy question - do you actually like listening him casting? If so, why?

Because, imo I can't stand him. It's like listening to a nine year old casting. It's extremely unprofessional and juvenile. His choice of music between games is extremely irritating as well, even though that is easier to just mute and ignore.

And yes, I know that I can just stop watching the games he casts, but basically every time I don't have any other choice when it's a game I really want to watch.

So, what are your honest opinions? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was called in to work today at the caf I'm usually at. It's the hottest day of the year and the caf had just won a very big award for Best Newcomer. And with that said, it's pretty easy to guess that we had a shit ton to do. And we were only two.

In enter Silver Hair Lady. She is from the beginning extremely.... "salty". Very unfriendly towards both me and my coworker. They order the breakfast (which consists of yoghurt with granola, two freshly made sandwiches, apple must and coffee) and we tell her that she will receive one of the items first and the other one in a few minutes. They get their coffee, must and sandwiches and go out. We have a few tables out on the square. 

After a few minutes I am done with their yoghurt and head out. I manage to bump into her outside and I say "Here's your yoghurt!"

SHL replies with "Yeah. It would be nice if WE COULD EAT EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME."

I apologize and tell her that we have a lot of things to do today and that we are only two people.

Here comes the first problem. I can't find the guy she was with. I really can't. He's not sitting by any of our outside tables. After a few seconds, I see the man waving his arms high in the air.

From the other side of the square. 

This square has three cafs, one restaurant and a bakery, and it's pretty far between the places outside tables.

He gets the yoghurt, I apologize again and return in.

SHL is standing at the counter going "YEAH, IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE IF WE COULD EAT EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME." to my coworker. He replies with "Please. It's saturday, the sky is blue and people are out. You have to think about that. And we're only two here, so we are really stressed."

SHL: "Yeah. Maybe you should try and have some service mind." and then she goes out again.

Something tells me that the caf that just got a reward from one of the countries biggest restaurant guides with one of the reasons being the excellent service, I don't think bad service mind is the problem here.

I think the problem here is that you are sitting AT ANOTHER CAFS TABLE expecting lightning fast service. And maybe the fact that this was the hottest day of the year. And again, we were only two people working.

Jesus christ. Fuck off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently came to think about a thing - how many of you guys aren't "seeing" or "feeling" very big?

I came to think about it when I looked at my erect penis and though to myself "Is this really what is considered big?" since I only have IRL experience with my own penis and have only had sex with women. So, I really don't consider my size to be small, but I also don't see myself as very big.

Is it just me, or do you guys also think about this sometimes?

	<TEXT> As a non american (and therefore extremely fascinated by sports team mascots) I have long wondered how the inflatable mascots work. I can not wrap my head around if there's a human being in there or not. Especially in clips like the Toronto Raptor [eats a cheerleader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRDsdWLqdBI) or the [dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTOlKgkoTB8).

So please, could someone explain? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys.

Stop it. Seriously. I really don't care what the person has done. I am also sick of removing post after post after post due to the fifth rule.

After this post - anything posted containing a special reason in the title to why you want to punch the person will result in a five day ban.

EDIT: And before anyone asks - titles such as "This dumbfuck from tumblr", "This idiot on vine" etc are allowed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So. Our old head mod, mr hammy, left reddit, but not before kicking all the mods except for me and thus leaving the sub over to me. I have invited back the two other mods and we have also got the addition of /u/Space_Ninja. Say hi, everbody!

[So, yeah. This is what is going down](http://i.imgur.com/JbB421q.gifv)

Either way - as head mod I have changed/updated the rules slightly.

**First of all** - I added the rule against soapboxing again since hammy removed it. I really don't care about what the person has done. If the face isn't punchable, it's not punchable. 

**Second** - No. God. Damn. Politics.

It's ok to post faces of politicans [as with this](http://i.imgur.com/2vRiAWl.jpg), but we don't want you posting things with "This fucking asshole politicians who does things I don't like". I don't care if you hate what they are doing. Even if you like a person, they can have punchable faces.

**Third** - I added an imgur rule. Use imgur as image host, please. Otherwise your post will be removed.

**Fourth** - Posting a banned face will result in a three day ban. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-02-20 18:54:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The placed I worked at before, the owner there went by the nickname "The Milk Nazi" for a while. This term was coined by some people at her old place when she recommended them to not have milk in their black coffee. This place was located in a "nicer part" of the town, and the residents didn't like being told how to drink their coffee. It was kinda like "Coffee is just coffee".

Either way - a while back, I worked for an online magazine as a writer and as we didn't have our own office, we used the local caf as our "office". (and no, we didn't buy one cup and sit there for four hours.)

After a while there, I noticed that there was an older man coming in a few times each day who ordered two coffees to go. What struck me was the amount of sugar he poured in it. At least six our seven teaspoons. At least. I can't imagine how awful it must've tasted.

So, what is the worst way you know a customer does to ruin a good brew? (Minus trying to order a mochachochalattefrappeparaplegic with extra pumpkin). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought about this on my way home today. I have always drunk quite a lot of coffee. At least since high school. Although, now I've cut down alot on it.

When I work by the machine I usually drink around two or three single espressos a day, with all the testing and so on. Especially when we switch around alot and tune the machine after our own liking.

I mostly drink the cups I make when practicing with the milk. But I would say maybe two or three latte/cappuccino a day.

If it's a slow day, I consume another three or four, at least, cups of our regular black coffee.

If I'm home (which I am most of the time since I'm unemployed right now) I keep myself to two cups a day.

So, how much do you drink? </TEXT>

Then I realized that I couldn't form a squad to search for games with a friend of mine who started playing today, so I chose to go back to infantry, for the small sum to get back. Then I realized, I have to pay 22k AGAIN to become tank crew. What the fuck? That really pissed me off.

I can understand that there's a fee first time doing it, but when wanting to go back and forth and trying out the different classes, why should one have to keep buying it? </TEXT>
