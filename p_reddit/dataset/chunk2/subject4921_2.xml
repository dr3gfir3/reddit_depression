	<TEXT> Don't be surprised if he might be out for the rest of the season.  I can tell you from direct personal experience that it takes a looooooong time to recover from herniated discs with conservative treatment.  Think about what happened to Tony Romo in 2013. He opted for surgery and was out for the ROS.  Look, I know he has much better doctors and physical therapists taking care of him than I never had, but expecting a quick recovery might be wishful thinking at best and the injury definitely, definitely lingers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone is trying to go to pharma though.  Pharma also isn't some panacea it is always made out to be.  Constant layoffs, restructuring, and outsourcing.   Pharma was literally one of the top 5 worst industries there for a while for layoffs.  When things go south at pharma the first people almost always laidoff are R and D.  Pharma has a notorious reputation for having unstable jobs for scientists.  My co-workers have literally gone through 5 jobs in probably 10 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mayuree Thai Tavern.  

I really can't emphasize how good their curries and noodle dishes are.  The ginger beef dish they have is also awesome.  People on Yelp like to complain about this place's portions but I have to whole heartedly disagree.  They also use higher quality ingredients.  I've been to Thailand over a dozen times and love Mayuree.  Also, if you go to Mayuree late at night on Fri. or Sat.  they have a 'secret' late night menu consisting of several different types of Thai noodle soups.  Totally awesome. Thai noodle soups are absolutely their own thing to and are much different than pho, ramen, or chinese style noodle soups.  I posted this photo of Mayuree's late night noodles over in r/food:

It's also a cool place to hangout--they have a pool table, foosball, darts, and nintendo.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Appology for poor quality photo, but I had my passenger take a photo of this light.  I can not figure out at all why there are many streets with lights like what is shown in the photo.  The street is a two way street, but it is only one lane.  So why in the world would you have a green/red light facing in YOUR direction when that light is overhanging in a lane with opposite going traffic?  Sometimes it confuses the crap out of me and I've seen many people who are from out of town inadvertently start driving in the wrong lane because of the way the lights look.  Seems like an unnecessarily dangerous thing to have.   </TEXT>

http://thailandbackpackershostel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tom-Yum-Goong.jpg

But they also have noodle soups with a similar style of flavoring on the street that might look like this:

http://www.beyondsustenance.com/site/2011/02/thailand-food-exploration-kuay-teow-tom-yum-sukhothai/

Basically all 'tom yum' means is a broth made from lemongrass, fish sauce, lime, and chilies.  Just like ramen or pho, there are probably a million styles/versions of tom yum  and other noodle soups in Thailand.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many scientists are NOT trained in statistics at all. I had to learn everything own my own, and even then, I'm quite sure I still don't have an expert level understanding of biostatistics.  

Yes, p values are exceeding abstract and tough to intuitively follow.  I'm all for changing the way things are done like adding descriptive statistics, using more Beysian approaches, etc.  

There are literally dozens of statistical tests to keep track of for all types of different situations, it can definitely can make your brain hurt when you need to decide which one is appropriate.  

Most biologists and medical scientists don't give a crap about descriptive statistics at all and only care about achieving that * or ** for what they're measuring and completely overlook that the size of the effect might be something like only a 5-8% change.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, sitting is absolute TORTURE if you have spinal nerve compression due to a herniated disc.  I had to literally stand at work all day while trying to use a computer for months on end.  I couldn't drive anywhere far or sit on a bus for long because sitting places the most stress on your lower spine and greatly increased the pain.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hate to say it, but as someone with the same exact type of injury as Kershaw and who got the same exact treatment he did, you're never 100% the same when your spine starts deteriorating.  You can still perform at a high level though, which I suppose is all that matters for fantasy, but you definitely do not feel the same, even years after your back recovers.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, you are a douche bag of epic proportions...like you know the dynamics of our relationship outside of what I've posted here.  

Obviously the problem isn't the 8 hours after I get off work and spend time with the SO--I get done what I need to do for the day and go home and spend the time that I have at home.  If you weren't so thick skulled, you'd realize the problem is when your wife wants to do something like go away to the beach during the summer for July 4th weekend, or wants to go to a family BBQ out of state that will last all day and take 4 hours to get to.  Or simply wants to get out and go hiking, camping, or something else that will take all day.  It. Can. Not. Be. Done. 

Again, if you're so smart, tell me exactly how you can stagger an experiment with 12 hour dosing intervals needed for 14 straight days.  Each time you'll also need 1.5 hours to setup, and another 1.25 hours to collect serum samples.  Tell me exactly how you'd schedule your days for 14 days straight so that you can go to the beach for a weekend, or so that you can go hiking all day at a state park.  If I come in at 3 AM, that means I still have to come in at 3 PM for 14 days.  If I come in at 9 AM I still have to be here at 9 PM....for 14 days.  If I come in  at midnight, I still have to be here at 12 PM to do everything...for 14 days straight.  Figure out how I can stagger this so we can go on a minivacation somewhere or out of town for weekend. I'm all ears.  Hell, I might even pay you to figure out how I can take a minivacation out of town for a weekend.  

It sounds like you've never done a drug study in your life before.  Next time you shouldn't assume so much.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sugar/glycobiologist here.  

DNA and protein dominated biology in the 20th century and still dominates the headlines because humans tend to feel nice and cozy about the fact that we have discovered a 'code' that should define what we believe is life.  It has been a long time since we have discovered DNA and over a decade since we have solved the entire genome, yet genomics still can not deliver upon the revolutions that were supposed to happen in medicine that were supposed to happen according to all of the hype in the 90s.  As time has gone on, we have started to realize that life is defined not only by proteins and DNA, but also by extremely important non-template (i.e. molecules not encoded by a template like DNA) driven molecules such as the entire classes of lipids and carbohydartes/glycans.   In otherwords, there's some sort of exquisitely tuned almost 'meta-level' of biology above and beyond DNA and protein that is required for life and as you imagine, has critically important consequences for major diseases like cancer.  

Over 20 years Krebs and Fisher won the Nobel prize for their discovery that protein phosphorylation can regulate protein activity.  Almost every biologist now knows that protein physiology, in simple terms, is turned 'on/off' by phosphorylation which is performed by a kinase, and is turned 'on/off' by the complementary phosphatase. There are literally hundreds or even thousands of different kinases/phosphatases in the entire proteome.  What we discovered, however, nearly 20 years later after Fisher and Krebs was that hundreds and thousands of proteins are actually glycosylated by a special sugar known as N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).  Even more interestingly, it was discovered that GlcNAc often gets added to proteins directly at serine/threonine residues within proteins that are often the same exact sites where proteins get phosphorylated. This observation has now been dubbed O-GlcNAc.

The significance of O-GlcNacylation of proteins can not be overstated.  O-GlcNAc is basically a 'cap' on a protein's sites of phosphorylation that has to be removed before a protein can be phosphorylated--in otherwords, protein physiology is vastly more complex than Krebs and Fisher's model.  If protein X has 3 sites of phosphorylation than the number of possible ways protein X could exist if you only consider phosphorylation would be 3x2x1=6.  However if you add in the fact now that O-GlcNAc exists and caps the sites of of phosphorylation you must now include all possibly combinations of O-GlcNacylation combined with phosphorylation.  Taking the same protein with 3 phospho sites and now including O-GlcNacylation at those same sites now gives you a total number of molecular species that could theoretically exist is 84!  An exponential increase of proteo physiology just by the addition of a sugar.  

Additionally, what really, really makes O-GlcNAc neat when compared to phosphorylation is the fact that the O-GlcNAcylation of thousands of proteins is only regulated by 2 enzymes--O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) which adds GlcNAc to proteins and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) which removes it.  That's it.  Contrast that to the 1000s of different kinases/phosphatases that are needed to regulate the phosho physiology of the proteome.  

An important concept to understand, however, is how GlcNAc (the substrate of OGT) is made.  GlcNAc descends from glycolysis through what is known as the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).  The HBP is a DIRECT LINK between metabolism/nutrition/stress to gene transcription, epigenetics, and tons of cell signaling (virtually all transcription factors, TETs, RNA poly II, P53, etc. etc. are modified by O-GlcNAc).  Of course in cancer you have the Warburg effect, whereby cancer cells utilize orders of more magnitude more glucose than is normal.  As you might of guessed, this absolutely perturbs the amounts of metabolites that transverse the HBP which goes on to significantly 'mess up' O-GlcNAcylation of a whole bunch of proteins, many of which are involved in cancer apoptotic networks, cancer epigenetics, cancer metabolism, and cancer gene expression. 


We've linked the Warburg Effect and abnormal sugar consumption to almost every aspect of cancer physiology through O-GlcNAc/HBP, so let's give some important examples.  

This interesting paper describes how O-GlcNAcylation of PFK1 (the main regulatory enzyme of glycoslysis) directly controls whether or not glycolytic products will get shunted towards energy production or towards the PPP (for the production of nucleotides):

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22923583


AMPK, a vital regulator of cellular energy metabolism is O-GlcNAc modified:
http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/22/1_MeetingAbstracts/614.7


Recent papers also now discuss how O-GlcNAc is pratically a 'master regulator' for all lipid biogenesis and metabolism, linking sugar/carbohydrate metabolism directly to the production or metabolism of lipids:

	<TEXT> The Warburg Effect most likely doesn't exist to provide cancer cells with energy.  Warburg shunts glycolytic products into all sorts of other anabolic pathways that synthesize things like nucleotides needed for DNA/RNA synthesis, fats for membrane synthesis, and other sugars used for cell surface glycosylation---all things rapidly proliferating cells need.  I don't think the observation that gliomas can rely on fats for fuel contradicts the Warburg Effect at all. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Not a microscopy expert here--can you use confocal to measure differences in endosome sizes or are they too small? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-12 19:02:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The facility we have here has a Zeiss LSM780-FCS single-point, laser scanning confocal microscope.  Here is the info for the objectives:


NA 0.55 condenser with DIC for 20X, 40X, 63X and 100X lenses


Objectives:
10X/0.45 PlanApo (dry, no DIC)
20X/0.80 PlanApo (dry, no DIC)
40X/1.30 PlanNeofluar oil, with DIC
40X/1.20 C-Apo water, for FCS only
40X/1.20 C-Apo water, with DIC, upon request
63X/1.4 PlanApo oil,  with DIC
100X PlanApo oil, with DIC, upon request


The paper I'm reviewing wants to examine size differences in endosomes using this confocal setup in order to determine if non-clatharin mediated (NCM) or clatharin mediated endocytosis (CM) is occuring.  NCM endosomes are claimed to have sizes on the order of 50-80 nm while CM endosomes are on the order of 100-150 nm.  The scale bar for the confocal images is 20 um.  Can you reasonably analyze images from a setup like above for size differences on that order? I'm just wondering if that's possible, given that the scale bar is 400x larger than a 50 nm object.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For example, I have a very difficult experiment that took a very long time just to get 3 replicates.  I have a control, medium treated group, and a high treated group.  In all biological replicates both the medium group and the high treatment groups produced an increase in response compared to the control, but because of high variance in the data, I didn't get statistically significant results with an ANOVA test even though in every case the signal went up.  Someone mentioned bootstrapping in another thread.  Can you just plug in 3 measurements and 'bootstrap it' to produce meaningful results if it is impossible to perform this experiment 6-10 times in a human amount of time?  This sounds too good to be true... </TEXT>
