	<TITLE> Careful with Uber, it can be a scam (west end to airport 30 pounds) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know that Reddit is filled with Uber shills, so I expect to receive some slack here. I just went from the West End (byres rd) to the Airport, and it costed me 30 pounds. Usually I do this with Hampden, booking through their app, and it goes for 15 pounds. In the rare occasion I use a black cab it cost me 20 pounds, hell, even the airport cabs cost me like 20 pounds too.

Some friends have had very bad experiences with Uber, but here in Reddit people seems to love it. So I decided to try it today, bad idea! When I went to book the taxi, it says there was a surge of x2. I now I shouldn't have used them, but I was stressed, with the bags, didn't want to lose the plane, so I took it. I just arrived to the airport, and boom, 30 pounds.

the x2 surge is bollocks. I have heard about this before (something shills forget to say). A wednesday 845am I never had a problem to find a taxi, and never Hampden complained to me about being busy or anything. In the odd time maybe Uber is cheap (the standard fare 15 pounds is the same as a private hire, so not that cheap), but in any decent timing, they are going to rape you.

Don't use Uber unless you are rich.

Also, the guy went through a longer route than expected. Cabs always from my house take west, through the tunnel, M8 and airport. This guy went to charing cross to take the M8. I have heard also before about their "strange" routing. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was today in a plane and sitting besides me there was an old woman who was a retired designer. Somehow the conversation went to how most stuff is designed by men, and she was saying than in general they are "bad" designers. She said this in a joking way, and she put as example the airport we landed on.

I never thought about this, but it'd actually make sense that depending on the sex of the designer things are done one way or another.

Do you think you could be able to tell the difference ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard/read a few times that they mostly offer their service in the south of the city, although I have used them to go from the West End to the airport, it happened to me a few times that the driver said he is not used to go to the West End, but the airport is a good trip.

I wonder if they would take me from the west end to Buchanan bus station, or if you recommend me some other company than can do this. (plenty of times Uber tells me there are no taxis available in the west end, so I don't want to take the risk, because getting that bus is quite important) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Stop comparing Ronda and Conor </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-16 14:05:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I see a lot of people here happy Ronda lost (I am too) and expecting Conor to lose in a month so that Dana cries. Conor and Ronda are different in every point of view. Their only common point is that they are the biggest PPV draws in UFC at the moment. Some differences:

- Ronda was undefeated. Conor already lost twice.

- Ronda was undisputed champion, and defended her belt several times. Conor hasn't even had a single championship fight yet.

- Ronda has good grappling and submission. Conor has good striking.

- Ronda fought near amateurs until yesterday. Conor has fought against the best possible FW guys except Aldo. Guys like Poirier or Holloway are very decent fighters.

- 99% people thought Ronda would win. Being optimistic, maybe a 50% expects Conor to win (probably less, if Conor loses that wouldn't surprise to anyone, in fact, Aldo losing would be more surprising).

- Everyone seem to call Ronda the best fighter and woman athlete on planet earth past present and future. No one considers Conor the best UFC fighter (although he is one of the best).

- Some people thought Ronda excels on her weak points (boxing, striking). She even thought she would beat a box champion. No one considers Conor good in the ground. He knows it is his weakest point. No one out there says "Conor would take NCAA wrestler champion".

- Ronda had no game plan, and very low fighting IQ. Conor's fighting IQ is among the best (watch TUF), and his game plan is usually on point.

- Ronda is training in a shitty place, shitty coach, shitty camp. Conor has a good coach, good camp. He is known for travelling around USA and Europe visiting gyms. 

- Ronda seems to be very unstable, only supported by yes people. Conors mentality is very strong. As said, he already lost twice, and he is here. He was punched hard by Mendes and taken down and kept his fresh mind.

- We saw yesterday Ronda has no chin. Conor has a pretty good chin.

- Conor has some banter running, he is always having a laugh. Everyone knows he is just kind of playing a character. Ronda looks out of character, she seems like an immature spoiled kid who is offended someone fights against her.

That said, I am a Conor fan (he is the reason I watch MMA). Also I respect Aldo a lot, so I think it is going to be 50 / 50. I love Conor's banter. if he loses against Aldo, I don't really care, it is part of the game. I think Conor is mostly supported by a small vocal minority of hardcore fans, while Ronda was mainstream. Maybe the mainstream will abandon Ronda, but I don't think we will abandon Conor. </TEXT>

I want to get a new extruder and replace it. I can see in the website it says something like extruder starting kit, but I don't know if this is what I need.

	<DATE> 2015-10-12 14:59:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have received a letter from the Council (in theory) saying that my landlord has received a rent penalty notice. It says that I shouldn't pay him rent, but once he fixes it, I will pay him back (and all the money I will miss to pay).

I don't really know if this is a scam or not. I prefer to keep paying him and ignore that letter. I don't want surprises. But there are a lot of things involved that makes things complicated. If I don't pay my landlord, he can just get angry and kick me out next month (it is a rolling contract, I have been in this flat for 2 years, and I want to stay another year). If I pay him, once he fixes the situation he may "claim" again all that money I shouldn't have paid, making me pay twice. I pay him through direct debit. So there will be a written statement in the bank.

I have contacted my landlord, but I haven't received any answer so far.

Are rent penalty notices normal? Should I be scared?

I have a good flat and I don't pay much. I don't want to move. I know people who just got a flat and in general they are paying 100 pounds more than me. Also, my landlord is cool. He never appears here, never. And he fixes everything very fast. He just got me a new washing machine with tumble drier for example.

I don't know what's the best route. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We were supposed to land in Edinburgh but the pilot landed in Glasgow instead. After waiting for 2 hours we went from Glasgow to Edinburgh.

The flight took exactly 20 minutes from take off to landing (ignoring taxing). It was 2 minutes maneuvering out of Glasgow. Then 14 minutes straight line. Then 4 minutes to land. The plane went a bit over the sea and then turned into Edinburgh.

We never went to cruise height or speed. I'd say at most like 10k feet and speed maybe 300mph.

All in all, the train is way faster considering all the time padding that flying requires. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I planning to go during November with my gf to celebrate her birthday. During our weekend getaways we usually go to the highlands or some big park because we like some moderate hiking (very moderate). But this will be during November, so going out is very unlikely.

So, do you have any recommendation for places where we can enjoy the weekend mostly indoors? I'm not a big fan of macro complexes like Cryeff Hydro.

Also, we don't want to be around Glasgow / Edinburgh, but not very far away. Somewhere you can drive in 2h, 3h at most, but if its near like loch Lomond, that's good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never used Instagram, it is not even open now, but it is the app that uses more battery, more even than the screen. I have already checked the app and disabled all possible things, but it still drains my battery. 

I don't want to remove the app because I use it occasionally, but on the other hand I cannot let it drain my battery. 

Any suggestion? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There is someone from Taiwan who since 1 month ago, more or less, is trying constantly to steal my Facebook account, and my Hotmail account. My username for Facebook is my hotmail e-mail.

So far this person has failed every time, but it is getting very annoying getting my mail or my facebook blocked almost every day. I have changed my passwords so many times that I don't even remember them anymore, so I carry with me a piece of paper (I know this is unsafe as hell, but I have changed my password like 30 times).

As said, this person blocks my hotmail almost every day, so I need to change password and receive a message to my phone to unlock. Also, almost every day too I think s/he manages to log in to my Facebook, because I get that warning about "did you log in from Taiwan?". I have changed my password to completely different things, so I guess somehow this person snipes my Facebook password. I can only think about my Android phone.

I am from Europe, so I have no relation at all with Taiwan.

My Desktop computer is a Linux, which I would say is safe. I also have a macbook, which as far as I know is safe. And then my android device (I never log in to my hotmail through Android).

I don't know what to do, apart from keep changing my password every day. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-09-19 11:48:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It happened around half past 10. I was 6 or 7 stops away from my destination, when the train stopped in a station for like 10 minutes. The driver said something I couldn't understand, and most people (there were like 10 people at most in the train) left it. The ticket collector came and said that there was a problem ahead, and that there would be a delay. He then came again like 5 minutes after that, and told me to leave the train because it'd terminate there. The moment he said that, the train started moving. It went on for 2 more stations, and then it stopped, and the ticket collector told me the train would terminate there. He asked me where I was going, I told him, and then he told me to wait there for like 20 minutes (half past ten, middle of fucking nowhere) to catch another train in another direction, and then make another change to my final destination.

So I stepped out of the train, in the middle of nowhere, alone. I went out the train station to see if I could see a cab or something, but all I could see were pubs, old dudes very drunk, and track suits, so I went back to the safety of the train station.

I have to say I am not from Scotland (or the UK), so I had no family or closed friends to come and get me. So I started to panic. Anyway I was lucky finally I could get hold of a friend who came and drove me home.

Shouldn't Scotrail (or Abelio) have a cab service or something for this kind of situations? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> It seems people is selling their flats to let, while more and more student accommodations are being built. Is it the end of the private market? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-15 15:31:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In my block (and the next one), where I rent a flat, in the last 2 months there have been 4 flats in the market. I have been there for 2 years, and I have never seen anything similar. It seems that the new laws against "buy to let" is pushing people to sells their flats. On the other hand, in the West End they are building more and more student accommodations. The situation in that sense is getting out of control.

I think most people is happy that the "buy to let" landlords are getting a bad a time, but on the other hand, they are the ones keeping the prices low. Student accommodations are a complete scam, and it seems they will be the only option in the near future.

As an example, at the moment I live alone in a studio, paying a fair price to a private landlord. if my landlord decides to sell (and I am kicked out, which may happen any given day, because I have been there for 2 years with only 6 months of contract and then rolling), it'd be completely impossible for me to get my studio in a student accommodation, because the price almost doubles. In a student accomodation, my only solution would be to get a room, and pay even more than what I am paying for my studio.

I am afraid in the near future the private landlors may dissapear, and we will only get these huge companies with huge student accommodations. At first I was happy about the new laws against "flat to let", but now, checking prices and doing numbers, I realise this people are the ones keeping the prices low, and by a big margin. A top room in a private flat in the West End goes for around 400 pounds a month. If you go to a student accomodations, prices start around 550 (and that's their worse room, way smaller than the one in the private market), something similar to what you can get in the private market goes for like 650-700. Studios go for like 800-900. Also, they force you to a full year contract.

I am not from the UK, but it does surprise me how is it possible that so much money can be charged for student accomodation. Before coming here, I lived in Denmark for 3 years, where I paid around 200 pounds a month in a student dorm (all included), I had friends in Germany who paid more or less the same, and I had friends in France where they got it almost for free. </TEXT>

I have heard there's a bus that goes this route for late flights, but I cannot see anything. On the other hand, the taxi may be insanely expensive.

	<DATE> 2015-08-02 11:23:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I will start by saying that I use Opencv and python, although I don't mind using another library or language.

I had this post 2 days ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/3f9zl7/how_can_i_detect_when_2_objects_merge/

One of the problems I have is the detection I would say. I use 2 ways, one is a MoG of Gaussians which works very well, except when the droplets are static for too long, which then it thinks they are part of the background. The other way uses more classic image processing, with watershed algorithm and distance transform. This fails when the droplets move too fast, because in a given frame they are a blurry shape (I am working with 30FPS).

I have been checking some of the literature, like the "idtracker" which was published in nature methods like half year ago, but their image processing seems very basic. or the droplets computer, which was published in nature a few months ago, but again their image processing looks very basic.

I have also done a quick "blob detection opencv" search, and again most of the stuff looks very basic, which just color segmentation or so. 

Also, I forgot to mention, the droplets are not always a circle. I tried using the hough transform, and it failed.

I dont know if theres any algorithm or existing library you can recommend me.

thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Imagine a 2D plane where rounded blob objects are moving. Sometimes these blobs fuse, sometimes they don't, sometimes they split. I have quite a lot of blobs, it can go from 10 to 20.

I am trying to get when they fuse. So far I have used the average size of the droplets, and when the size increases we can assume there has been a fusion. While this works sometimes, it also fails a lot.

I also have to say that my image processing works quite well, but sometimes it can miss a few objects on some frames because they move very fast or because they go outside the viewport and they enter again, and this creates problems when just testing for area. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I need to buy a Scotland flag for tomorrow (so it cannot be on-line). It is for a friend who is leaving.

I wonder if there's any shop that sells them around the West End, or maybe the city centre?? </TEXT>
