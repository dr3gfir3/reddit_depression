	<TEXT> I can see how the D/H values imply that given the nature of the diagram but it's more specific than that. There are [different types of asteroids / meteoroids (ites)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_classification#Traditional_classification_scheme), of which the oldest, most chemically primitive are the [CI - Carbonaceous chondrites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonaceous_chondrite#CI_group). The Earth's bulk silicate composition is also typically presented as chondritic in composition (Chondritic Earth Model; [CHUR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope_geochemistry) - the Chondritic Uniform Reservoir). Carbonaceous chondrites, were formed in the same swirl of dust, grit, ice and gasses that gave rise to the sun some 4.6 billion years ago, well before the planets were formed. The D/H values shown as asteroids don't necessarily mean that water came from the asteroid belt, but rather that the composition of the water in the asteroids within the asteroid belt have the same composition as the Earth's water. A good summary that may be more clear can be found [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2814676/Oceans-old-Earth-New-study-finds-meteorites-brought-water-planet-forming-meaning-life-begun-earlier-previously-thought.html).   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> iirc correctly, it was assumed that due to less exposure to toxins as well as a presumed [low carbohydrate diet](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carbs-and-gut-microbes-fuel-colon-cancer) cancer rates would be expected to be lower (a major reason behind the claimed benefits of [the paleolithic fad diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet)).

	<TEXT> In my opinion no, although there certainly are contrasting theories between geology and astronomy that often do tend to "butt heads" (Deccan Traps vs Impact, Asteroids + Volcansim vs. Comets, Volcanism and anoxiic conditions vs. Gamma Ray Bursts,Younger Dryas and abrupt climate vs. Comet, etc.). *Most* theories, with the exception of the K-T extinction are in favour of the geological evidence, and in my opinion this is no different given the evidence. Quite honestly, [no cometary D/H values match the Earth's reservoir values](http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2014/12/first_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio/15106937-1-eng-GB/First_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio.jpg) with the exception of one example with some uncertainties that take it outside of Earth's values. Meanwhile, there are plenty of asteroids that do as you can see in the hyperlink provided. Furthermore, the geological side has [some pretty darn good evidence](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater) not only from asteroids but from the Earth itself. It seems rather difficult to claim that [the large amount of water deep within the mantle](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25723-massive-ocean-discovered-towards-earths-core.html) was incorporated at a much later time rather than being within hydrous mineral phases themselves during accretion. Adding to Earth, we can add evidence to the argument by showing that [the moon was also relatively 'wet'](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n3/full/ngeo1735.html) during its formation as well. This implies that the source material must have also been 'wet'. 

Meanwhile, as far as I'm aware, the only evidence for a cometary origin for the majority of water on Earth comes from speculation that the Earth must have been too hot to retain water during accretion and immediately after accretion, insinuating a 'magma ocean.'  As well as during the lunar impact model, and the D/H values of comet Hartley 2 (which as noted above have a degree of uncertainty that takes it out of the range required to claim a match with Earth's D/H values). The aforementioned assumption that the Earth may have been a 'magma ocean' [have been seriously questioned](http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/09/early-earth-less-hellish/). This leaves the only *somewhat* reliable evidence then for a cometary origin of Earth's water from comet Hartley 2. All that being said, it appears that the evidence is strongly in favour of the more geological argument, and I find it troubling that given the rather weak counter argument, "...[many scientists... believe that comets probably brought much of the water of the Earths oceans](http://blog.eag.eu.com/the-origin-of-life-a-long-and-winding-road/dirty-snowballs-and-our-origins/)..."

If you're going to promote a theory and make bold claims those theories and claims require strong evidence, something the cometary argument, quite honestly, *currently* lacks to a large degree. I hope that helps provide some insight into the topic in question.  

EDIT: Actually, I forgot that there is another piece of evidence for a cometary origin of water, although it is rather suspect at best given a) the counter evidence, as mentioned above with lunar water from the lunar highlands, and other values b) logically it's suspect and c) their are criticisms of their methods (ie. using apatite to derive D/H values is a questionable choice of mineral). That being said [here it is](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n2/abs/ngeo1050.html). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'll have to excuse me on this one as (in my opinion) I have a lot to learn myself in this regard to comets and their formation; however, I will attempt to answer it.

To my understanding, I don't believe comets were able to form within the early inner solar system. The "[frost line / snow line](http://www.subarutelescope.org/Pressrelease/2009/02/17/fig01_e.jpg)" (--simplified) places constraints on their formation such that water ice can only form beyond it, and typically not within it; therefore, comets only formed in the outer regions of the Solar System.    

...Deuterium outgassed over plain hydrogen

This relates to kinetic fractionation, a process that is based on mass, and is the dominant mode of isotope fractionation in low-temperature environments (space). Deuterium is [an isotope of hydrogen](http://www.wwk.in/resources/content/imagesv4/chemistry/Inorganic+chemistry/himg2.jpg) and has more mass (ie. it's heavier). This means it requires more energy to raise their vibrational energies, which implies that hydrogen will always be preferentially lost over deuterium. As a rule, bonds between the lighter isotopes are broken more easily than equivalent bonds of heavier isotopes. Hence, the light isotopes react faster, causing the residual matter to become enriched in the heavy isotopes.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If there were any comets during formation their signature has yet to be found and is lost by the overwhelming signature from asteroids, and more specifically a specific class of asteroids known as [carbonaceous chondrites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonaceous_chondrite). CI carbonaceous chondrites are considered by many researchers to be the most pristine samples of original solar system material, and for the estimated composition of Earth, their values are all in close agreement (Chondritic Earth Model, used by geologists and geochemists to normalize REE values - known as chondrite normalized). This is the basis for the chondritic model, which holds that Earth (and presumably the other terrestrial planets) was essentially built up from bodies made of such meteoritic material. This idea is corroborated by isotopic studies of rocks derived from interior regions of Earth. Further research only adds to the currently accepted theory that the water on Earth originated during planetary formation ([see latest research](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater)) and the majority was not derived from cometary sources as is further [indicated by D/H ratios](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/10/23F39F8900000578-2869018-ESA_s_Rosetta_spacecraft_has_found_the_water_vapour_from_its_tar-m-9_1418245571472.jpg). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's really not hard to get water from comets onto the Earth.

It's even easier if the water was already locked up in hydrous minerals during accretion from chondritic asteroids, and not from a late cometary source.

To sum up from another post:
To be honest, the cometary origins of water on Earth has always been ill-favoured and misrepresented as favourable in media, and by astronomers / astrophysicists / [theoretical physicists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R16cXQBndQ t=4m31s). The argument was shown in [ESAs promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H08tGjXNHO4 t=1m45s) for the Rosetta mission, and touted by many others which is unfortunate. The vast majority of evidence is [in favour of chondritic sources](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater) and degassing from volcanism, and always has been. To see it persistently claimed that comets are the source of Earth's water is misleading and upsetting to say the least.

	<TEXT> Comet 67P/C-G is a Jupiter Family comet and was therefore thought that it might have similar values to those of Hartley 2, which closely approximated Earth's D/H value. All other Oort Family comets do not share similar D/H values with Earth's reservoirs. Currently, the best fit are a class of asteroids: [chondrites](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater).

	<TEXT> It's an excellent question, and certainly the right train of thought. Although this is the 1st time we have physically landed on the comet it's not the 1st time we've sampled their D/H ratio. In fact, the measurement was made by the [ROSINA instrument](http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/35061-instruments/?fbodylongid=1650) located on Rosetta which is orbiting 67P, and not by the lander Philae. We have actually sampled a lot more than 2 comets. Although difficult and uncertainties are larger, we have made several observations from Earth as well. [This image](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/10/23F39F8900000578-2869018-ESA_s_Rosetta_spacecraft_has_found_the_water_vapour_from_its_tar-m-9_1418245571472.jpg) produced by ESA shows a number of asteroids and comets and other bodies with regards to their D/H ratio and Earth. I wouldn't say that we have ruled out comets as a source or even a contributor; however, I would say that the evidence is strongly in favour of an origin relating more so to asteroids than comets. What I'm stating above is that given the current evidence, it simply doesn't make sense to promote the weaker theory as is so often seen with regards to this topic. 

That being said, we can always use bigger sample sizes and higher resolution data to form a more definitive interpretation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're absolutely correct to question /u/stupidankle's explanation, because it's incorrect. Clear ice has very little to do with currents and [much more to do with the rate of freezing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChuIiAuW5m8 t=40m50s). If the water is cooled too quickly it doesn't have enough time to reject any impurities as it crystallizes - those impurities are then held within the crystal lattice and distort the crystal lattice. Thus, if there are impurities such as trapped gases, organic material and other minerals or dissolved salts (an inhomogeneous mixture) the ice will appear optically translucent, or even opaque. However, if the water cools and freezes over a longer duration of time, it has time to reject these impurities as it crystallizes. This eventually gives rise to a more homogenous mixture and less defects in the crystal lattice which creates clear, transparent water ice.

Typically, if you do here of a crash it was because as you noted... it was the wrong tool for the job, pilot error, or something overlooked by the engineer. Personally, I feel the 206's get manhandled far too easily by the elements - hence my preference for the larger helicopters especially in mountainous terrain.

	<TEXT> This study provides experimental evidence that the DNA's genetic information is essentially capable of surviving the extreme conditions of *space* and the re-entry into Earth's dense *atmosphere*.

Unless it states it elsewhere within the paper itself, this says nothing for DNA being able to survive the initial ejection created by an impact event itself or the subsequent temperatures and pressures associated with the impact of the of the object itself. Furthermore, are the temperatures associated with the re-entry of a space vehicle closely approximated by those of a meteor, typically at much higher speeds? I'd be hesitant to extrapolate the findings of this study to the bigger question(s).    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd have to call it a [phyllite](http://geologycafe.com/images/m26.jpg) with biotite poryphyroblasts. 


Phyllites are typically grey to black in colour with a silky lustre on their pervasive cleavage planes due to the alignment of mica minerals. Often phyllites exhibit a crenulation cleavage which can be seen as a crenulation on the cleavage surface.
Phyllites are formed by regional metamorphism of argillaceous sediments since their cleavage arose due to deviatoric stress. Phyllite is typical of greenschist grade metamorphism. With increasing metamorphic grade increases in mica grain-size transforms phyllite into schist. However, some phyllites have experienced an overprint by contact metamorphism resulting in the growth of biotite, andalusite or cordierite porphyroblasts, these are often randomly orientated and grow across foliation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my critiques of this short is the theory that water on Earth was derived from comets. Though this theory is interesting and there is still more data to be collected, currently it is not the leading theory for the origin of water on Earth. The notion that water on Earth is derived from cometary sources is based on 1 sample, comet [Hartley 2](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368/fig_tab/nature10519_F2.html) while many others [have been ruled out](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news008.html). On the other hand, the leading theory states that Earth's water is a result of volcanic degassing with strong support from multiple studies and a plethora of evidence. For example, the deep interior of the Earth (the mantle) still contains [a large reservoir of water](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25723-massive-ocean-discovered-towards-earths-core.html) (if collected from the minerals, it would contain ~3x the volume of all the water present in the Earth's ocean). Lunar water has been discovered [in large amounts](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n3/full/ngeo1735.html) native to the moon and not derived from comets, and a good portion of that water came from interstellar sources, [older than our sun](http://www.nature.com/news/earth-has-water-older-than-the-sun-1.16011). For the most part, [extraterrestrial sources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth#Extraterrestrial_sources) (ie. Comets) for the origin of water on Earth have been ruled out.

	<TEXT> Perhaps the insight provided by such an animation has gone overlooked by you. There is clearly an observable increase in frequency and intensity from '08 to '14. Prior to this, as can be inferred from the animation, seismicity within the region is relatively minimal. Seismicity due to geological factors should be somewhat benign given [the potential within the region](http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/US-FAULT-LINES.jpg) due to the intraplate location. As increased density distribution and overpressures are becoming more common with fracking, one could predict an increase in seismicity - exactly what is observed within the time interval '08 - '14.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Next to none - these are seamounts, the vast majority of which are inactive / extinct. 

A number of statements from the USGS:
On average, human activities put out in just three to five days, the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide that volcanoes produce globally each year.

Some actual numbers:
 Our studies show that globally, volcanoes on land and under the sea release a total of about 200 million tonnes of CO2 annually. 

As per the data provided by [the Global Carbon Budget Project](http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/14/hl-compact.htm), in 2013, total anthropogenic input of CO2 was 36Gt (Gigatonnes) and is estimated to be *2.5% more in 2014*.

A comparison in annual values:

Source | Tonnes CO2 | Scientific Notation | 
---|---|----
Volcanoes | 200,000,000 | 2.0x10^8
Fossil Fuels* | 36,000,000,000 | 3.6x10^10
  Tonnes| 35,800,000,000 | 3.5x10^10 | 

*Note: Fossil fuels value is for the annual output in 2013.

So what's that mean % wise? It means that the total contribution from volcanic CO2 makes up less than one percent (0.5%) of the total CO2 in our atmosphere relative to fossil fuel input. 

EDIT: I made a quick graph to help illustrate the difference in input from each source: [Volcanoes   Fossil Fuels](http://i.imgur.com/RLYmCxq.png) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was unable to see the flashes that you mention; however, volcanic lightening is certainly a possibility and is actually fairly common in volcanic plumes. It's a relatively new field of study so there are still many unanswered questions. That being said, the leading theory is that it forms as a result of electric charges building up in the ash-laden plume of an eruption. Ash particles are bits of pulverized volcanic rock less than 2 mm(or 1/12 of an inch) in diameter, and although they may look like smoke from a distance, the fact that theyre composed of rock means that they can, under the right conditions, conduct electricity. A significant portion of the gas escaping a volcano is composed of water vapor  we all know that wet things conduct electricity better  and some researchers think that ice crystals forming from water vapor in the column freezing at higher altitudes can also increase the electrical conductivity of the plume.

Cimarelli, C *et al*., successfully replicated at least one manner in which volcanic lightening is generated (video of experiment [**1**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QoiTcQcyTY)   [**2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2XHFtKgq5s)) and noted that there are ideal conditions for creating volcanic lighting. Cimarelli *et al*. found that electrical discharges only happened with specific size ranges of the ash, at certain points in the experimental process: finer ash produced a larger number of discharges concentrated in the turbulent shell around the larger particles in the core of the plume, and when the fines-rich turbulent portion went away, discharges stopped. When they repeated the decompression experiments with glass beads instead of volcanic ash, they were also able to suggest several mechanisms for building charges. In plumes with two different bead sizes, larger beads tended to become positively charged while smaller ones tended to negative charges, and provide a gradient for charges to want to cross; however, when the beads were all the same size in a turbulent plume, the authors suggest that there was a mix of charges, but that like charges tended to cluster and thus form the necessary gradients. The key similarity was that the plumes had to be fines-rich and turbulent; once the plume was mainly composed of larger particles, the lightning stopped.

#[Figure 2 in Cimarelli et al., 2013](http://blogs.agu.org/magmacumlaude/files/2014/02/lab-lightning.jpg)
The results of decompression experiments with volcanic ash, with graphs of electric potential, vent pressure and angle of the gas-thrust region. The shaded area in the graphs indicates lightning flash occurrence times, and D-F show progressive shots of the experiment.

And if you're interested, co-author Don Dingwell gives an excellent presentation of his research entitled: 
[Dance on a Volcano: A Quarter Century of Experimental First Ascents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFraFPhtHlQ t=68m8s) in which he discusses volcanic lightening rather briefly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this is what it must have been for pompeii and mount st-helens and for countless other

There are some key difference that make Pompeii and Mount. St. Helens different than what this looks like. In fact, Pompeii and Mount. St. Helens were likely far more terrifying. This video was of volcanic ash falling down, [suspected](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/news/20140927_32.html) to be from a [phreatomagmatic / phreatic eruption](http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Hydrovolcanic.html) due to the low temperature of the ash (though further analysis is needed). 

And while a [pyroclastic flow did occur on Mt. Ontake](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20140927/t10014927291000.html) this is not what the hikers experienced. It is, on the other hand, what the people of Pompeii and those close to Mount St. Helens experienced amongst subsequent higher temperature ash fall (burying them and cooking them in clouds of ash and toxic gases) and the initial force of the blast (which [shredded the forest](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg-Mendip-Hills/10MND-Mount-St-Helens-Tree.jpg)) and later lahar flows.

While this would still have been terrifying to experience, it's far removed from the likes of Pompeii and Mount St. Helens.

That's what made the journey heading out there so amazing. The contrast between driving down the coast and driving east of Lakeview was like night and day.

	<TEXT> Vancouver BC is considered to be one the worlds, if not thee worlds, largest hubs for mining companies. I've been working for junior companies in mineral exploration for a number of years now, steadily - even with the swings in the market. If you put in the effort I'd have a hard time believing that you wouldn't find work in mineral exploration in Canada. 
For starters, head to major conventions for networking and other opportunities, preferably when the market is in good shape (though this isn't a direct relation it certainly helps). AME BC's [Roundup](http://www.amebc.ca/roundup-2015-home) convention is an excellent choice held in Vancouver as well as the worlds largest convention for mineral exploration and mining, [PDAC](http://www.pdac.ca/convention), held in Toronto.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're most welcome, I'm glad I was able to provide you with some new material. I'm not terribly surprised that the original paper (not this article) made it through peer-review. I would assume that the data and conclusions looked to be fairly well determined at the time. It wasn't until other scientists started looking at their work and trying to replicate their findings that they noticed the immense crock that was published. What I am surprised at is that, from my knowledge, the original paper was never retracted. Firestone *et al*. continue to publish and continue their bad science... just this year their results for another area of research were [found to be utter bunk](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1406/1406.5141.pdf). 

A short summary read can also be found [here](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/climate/extinction-younger-dryas-impact-surovell-2009.html) regarding the topic with a few links to papers sprinkled throughout that I may not have included in the previous submission.  </TEXT>

#Here are a few responses I've compiled regarding this topic (the article linked by OP is unfortunately atrociously bias and extremely ignorant of the plethora of solid research that refutes this idea) 

Post One:
___
For any of the uninformed on the subject, specifically the YD ([Younger Dryas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas)) and the overwhelming problems surrounding the [impact hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_event#Criticism), I can provide a few links to previous discussions regarding it and the other well established views regarding the YD event at the bottom of my comment for anyone who's interested. Needless to say, this article references James Kennett who is well known for his work [with Firestone *et al*](http://imgur.com/a/OpUMC) - who are notoriously known within the scientific community for promoting bunk science and refusing to address key issues with their work and the criticisms of others. The credibility of Firestone consortium is not without serious questioning as [this article](http://www.psmag.com/science/comet-claim-comes-crashing-to-earth-31180/) brings to notice. 
#Links to previous discussions regarding the impact hypothesis

- Probably the most useful link with links to papers [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/19j1ly/comet_killed_clovis_culture_evidence_doesnt/c8omfvv)
- Spatiotemporal dynamics of the Clovis-Folsom transition (Collard et al., 2010) and criticisms of the methods and techniques used and claimed by Firestone *et al.* [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1a3mk9/ancient_americans_were_not_wiped_out_by_a_comet/c8uqkbb?context=3)  
- Although already posted in the 1st link, it's important to read to understand that even an air-burst event has been refuted by credible scientists. [here](http://beforeitsnews.com/science-and-technology/2013/01/clovis-comet-hypothesis-called-bogus-by-credible-scientist-2532500.html) 

___

Post Two:
___
The underlying event that is being referred to in this article is the  [Younger Dryas stadial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas). Several theories have been proposed and to date, the best theory is the [draining of Lake Agassiz](http://www.blc.arizona.edu/courses/schaffer/182h/Climate/Was%20the%20Younger%20Dryas%20Triggered%20by%20%20a%20Flood.pdf) proposed by Wallace S. Broecker. Note that in the paper by Broecker a flood path was not known - this was in 2006. In 2010 [the flood path was found](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7289/full/nature08954.html), confirming the draining of Lake Agassiz. However, Firestone et al. proposed that the cause was derived from an [extraterrestrial impact](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016.full.pdf). Firestone and his team are well known for trying to push this hypothesis over the years and even recently; however, it's *evidence* has been refuted [on more than one occasion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_hypothesis#Criticism). More to the roots of this article though, the end the prehistoric Clovis culture is a non-issue. In the words of [Mark Boslough](http://beforeitsnews.com/science-and-technology/2013/01/clovis-comet-hypothesis-called-bogus-by-credible-scientist-2532500.html): 
Just because a culture changed from Clovis to Folsom spear points didnt mean their civilization collapsed, he explained. They probably just used another technology. Its like saying the phonograph culture collapsed and was replaced by the iPod culture."

	<TEXT> One could ask themselves a couple of questions regarding plate tectonics which may lead to an interesting view. Is plate tectonism identical under all conditions? Has plate tectonics on Earth evolved or changed over geologic time? Given the degree of variability within the known universe, let alone our own solar system, is constraining our definition of plate tectonics to the model we have constructed from our data on Earth perhaps somewhat limiting? 

Given the above, I wouldn't say that it's *not truly plate tectonics* but rather that the term *plate tectonics* is the umbrella term underneath which there exists a host of subtypes or classes. Rocky, Cryo, and otherwise. 

Here's an [image](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/14-241_0.jpg) with the following description:
Conceptual model for subduction. Recycling of surface area through the subduction of a cold, brittle, outer portion of the ice shell into its warmer interior, where it is ultimately subsumed. Potential cryolavas are forced to the surface through the overriding plate. The higher density of the subducting outer ice layer obviates buoyancy-induced topographic relief at the site of subduction. Plate collision results in contractional deformation in the overriding plate along the collisional margin, creating the tabular subsumption bands. -Nature Geoscience (2014) doi:10.1038/ngeo2245

	<TEXT> This is immense. Currently Earth is the only known celestial object that is known to have active plate tectonics. If the evidence stands the test of time and it ends up holding true, it could enrich our understanding of plate tectonics - currently, the only type or class of plate tectonics that we have a relatively good grasp of is in regards to rocky material. The plates on Europa are made of ice and thus the dynamics will differ... but by how much?

Doesnt the core of a body need to be rather active to still have "moving" plates?

As I alluded to above, this is precisely my point. This would likely hold true(ish) if it they were rocky plates, but they're not. Perhaps they're driven by tidal forces or some other forces (phase changes?), etc.

	<TEXT> Sure thing. 

Roughly 400Ma (400 million years ago) during the [Devonian](http://www.geosociety.org/science/timescale/timescl.pdf) North America was situated along the equator ([fig. 1](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/rcb7/namD385.jpg))([fig. 2](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/rcb7/400_Devonian_2globes.jpg)). At that time, British Columbia didn't exist as a part of North America and the [continental shelf](http://jjustinianomarinescience.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/0/9/17099444/511816488_orig.gif) was essentially located along where the Alberta border would later be defined in the south. 400Ma, the coast of North America was a warm, tropical, shallow water environment (see fig 1   2) and coral reefs were numerous - this is seen in the lower most Formations ([Fairholme   Palliser](http://paulzizkaphotography.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/rundlegeology.jpg)) as thick limestone deposits. Plate tectonics never ceased and North America was on the move - this time; however, the waters were getting deeper, colder, and with less oxygen. Thus deposits went from ancient reefs and shallow water deposits to deeper, finer sediments like silt and clays that would later form shale, forming the Banff / Exshaw Formation. This shale formation erodes more readily than the limestone formations, hence its appearance. The scene was about to change again - this time the seas were retreating and as North America continued its migration the environment was changing from deep water deposits back to shallow marine deposits. This leads to the top most formation known as the Rundle Formation. Millions of years would pass (~150) and North America would continue to shift - eventually around 80Ma to 90Ma North America would collide with a large land mass (termed the [Insular Terrane](http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/student/seigel1/tectonic_evolution/physio_belt_map.jpg)), unable to be subducted, which would provide the energy to deform, [folding and faulting](http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/geology/publications/state/tx/1968-7/images/fig26.jpg) the ancient deposits and thrusting the thick units atop one another. Millions more years worth of weathering and erosion have left [what you see today](http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/glac/3/images/fig3.jpg) (or an animation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZARSY4TMO6Y t=0m20s)). I hope that wasn't overly complicated and if you have any questions, I'd be happy to try and explain it either more clearly or in more detail.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The rust coloured rocks are most likely from ARD (acid rock drainage) and need not be associated with mining activity (it can occur naturally by various means). The white colour is more perplexing though I would suspect that sources of the influx would share a common parent. You have stated that the area in which they were located were between Anaktuvuk and Wiseman which are in the area of the Brooks Mountain Range - an area that has geothermal activity ([Reed River hot springs](http://jlc-web.uaa.alaska.edu/client/en_US/testy/search/detailnonmodal;jsessionid=183CBD47D48FAFBA47D06B790127B8F2?qu=Special+report d=ent%3A%2F%2FSD_ILS%2F259%2FSD_ILS%3A259082~ILS~0~5722 ps=300), and others). My assumption is that there may be pulses of activity reaching the surface with elevated [iron, sulphur, and pyrite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_mine_drainage#Chemistry) leading to the colouration of the stream(s). The white is likely associated, though perhaps it's following a different pathway or simply originating from a different pulse of fluids (perhaps rich in colloidal silica, carbonate or another). Regardless, there is most certainly a change in pH and it could also be from bacterial activity (or at least in part) as well; however, my primary cause is some sort of influx via hydrothermal fluid input.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had never been to Saskatchewan before this summer and of course was filled with... we'll say, minimal excitement regarding the terrain. Of course I had succumb to the stereotype far too often portrayed... flat, with a lot of lakes. Now don't get me wrong, it certainly is flat relative to B.C. (where I grew up) and it certainly does have a lot of lakes, but there's a beauty to be seen even within such a simple landscape. It wasn't until a few weeks in, returning to camp from the field in the helicopter, that it all sank in. The image of the lodge pole pines poking out of the thick moss brought back particular memories: [lunch break](https://www.flickr.com/photos/luxlaboratories/14419704601/sizes/l). I'd like to go back and explore some of the areas you've shown - there's a lot of land mass and evidently, a lot to see. The rest of my shots from the Saskatchewan based property can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/luxlaboratories/sets/72157644764865100/) if you're interested.      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That mineral could only be produced under massive pressure and heat

In referring to Jadeite, this is incorrect. Jadeite is associated with blueschist facies mineral assemblages which are produced in subduction zones. Here, the pressures are high, however, the geothermal isobars are [suppressed](http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/structure/dynamicearth/subduction/thermalbig.gif) giving rise to low temperatures. In other words Jadeite is a High-P low-T mineral.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen it time and time again and it's an easy error to make, confusing tectonics with plate tectonics. I hope the explanation has cleared up any misconceptions around some requirements for plate tectonics. I should state that while there are some basic physical and chemical principles that must be applicable to all forms of plate tectonics, there may be other forms of plate tectonics that differ from how plate tectonics occurs on Earth. 

As per the downvote, I never downvote. Simply because someones understanding may be somewhat limited is no cause to downvote, in my opinion; It's an invitation to clear up any misconceptions or to discuss some details regarding a specific topic. If you have any other questions feel free to ask and hopefully I can shed some light or, in the very least, refer you to some information that can. Cheers.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't think we can rule out lunar plate tectonics quite yet

Actually we can. While the moon is still tectonically active it lacks a) lithospheric plates and b) it lacks a prime requirement for plate tectonics as we know it, water. 

- [The critical importance of water to plate tectonics](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm) 

While the moon certainly still has [regions of melt](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/508668main_lunar_core_lg.jpg) and may lead to volcanism in the [geological future](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/17/moon-volcanoes), the connection between a region of partial melt and plate tectonics is quite a far stretch. There are numerous bodies with active interiors, including Jupiter's moon Io; however, without water it also lacks plate tectonics, it's mountains generated through tectonism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes absolutely, they need not even form typical vertical columns either, rather they may form [fans, chevrons, rosettes, and basin patterns](http://www.glgarcs.net/images/columnar/joint_patterns.gif).  

- The fan pattern is formed when the lava flowed into a valley.

- The chevron pattern is formed when the lava has more than one cooling surface and joints propagate from each surface.

- The rosette pattern is formed when the lava spouted from a point has a domed cooling surface.

- The basin pattern is formed when isotherms curved attributed to the topography under the lava.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hot lava contracts as it cools and therefore it is widely accepted that the cooling process creates the vertical jointing. However, the exact mechanisms of this process is not well defined and depend on the location as well (different location = different variables). Under *ideal* conditions, lava will be of uniform composition and density, will have a flat surface, and so will cool evenly. When lava cools, it contracts, and therefore it would contract evenly. [This figure](http://www.glgarcs.net/images/columnar/columnar_model.gif) demonstrates how this contraction would cause regular fractures.  If physically uniform lava with the flat surface is static and cools evenly, the lava contracts equally with many centers of contraction across the surface. Each contraction area represents a circle due to physical uniformity. As it contracts, cracks, *ideally* hexagonal, are formed among the circles. These cracks extend into the lava, forming parallel hexagonal columns. However, since the lava may not cool evenly and other variables will change depending on composition and location, columns including five-sided and seven-sided columns are created as well as six-sided columns. Ideally, these fractures would be regularly spaced and organized in the shapes of regular hexagons, creating a tessellation of linked hexagons that could be seen from above. 

It forms polyhedrons due to efficiency of compaction and it must compact due to cooling (*generally*, matter becomes more dense as it cools and less dense as it heats up). Dessication cracks (mud cracks), though not due to cooling, must form as well due to the loss of water. If the surface material loses water it must contract to accommodate the loss - it contracts similarly to the figure above and polyhedrons are therefore the end result.  </TEXT>
