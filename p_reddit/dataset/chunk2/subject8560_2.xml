	<TEXT> The whole JFK assassination conspiracy is (very) interesting, but there is simply too little credible/genuine evidence that supports the hypothesis that Oswald did not act alone.  It's definitely possible (that he had conspirators), just insufficient for me to base such a belief in.  At one point I probably wanted it to be true, and would have said I believed it.  But not today.  I doubt there was a (US) government conspiracy (or cover-up), unless a single "rouge" official played some role.

It's interesting because IF the conspiracy is true, it's probably the best one of our time.  Unless it was a conspiracy with another government (/agent), that is more probable than anything "corrupt" within the US (to this level, and at that time).  It's also interesting because of how many people want to believe the US government is (that) corrupt, and capable of this, let alone able to pull off a cover-up (to date).  Oswald says he was a patsy, that is intriguing, yes.  Probably the most credible thing in my mind to support the theory/belief.  Everything else if very circumstantial and insufficient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What can you buy for half a million dollars in today's real estate market? This price point is a unique one, bridging the gap between what's considered average and luxury.

If "average" is the U.S. median home value, which is currently at $177,500 according to Zillow, and a luxury property is any home priced at $1 million or more, these $500,000 houses fall about the middle. Of course, in some markets, $500,000 will buy a lot of square footage and ample amenities. In others, it'll buy a modest apartment at best.

For example, in Las Vegas you can buy a four bedroom house with its own gas fire pit and putting green. In New York City, you can buy a two bedroom apartment with a cramped kitchen and the luxury of doing your laundry indoors.

Here is what around $500,000 will buy in 10 cities across the country. </TEXT>
