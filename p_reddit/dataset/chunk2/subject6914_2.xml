	<TEXT> What is surprising, though, is how much teens consistently overestimated the risk behaviors of their peers. In virtually every case, the jocks and popular teens did not use more substances, have more sexual partners, or break the rules any more than all the other kids at school. But they were perceived as doing all these risky behaviors a lot.
And these misperceptions also ran in the opposite direction. Take studying, for example  a decidedly less cool thing to do during adolescence. Teens over-attributed studying to the nerds by far, even though the nerds really didnt study more than anyone else in the school.

In short, the teens saw their peers through a caricatured lens.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although those are the latest statistics on birds, there have still been no airplanes hit by drones as of today.

There are on the order of 10 billion birds in U.S. airspace. Although efforts are made to keep them away from airports, where they pose the biggest threat, pilots, airlines, airports and others voluntarily reported 13,414 bird-aircraft collisions on the FAAs dedicated wildlife strike website in 2014, split about equally between passenger jets and other aircraft including helicopters and small planes....


Meanwhile, to date, no modern quadrocopter, commercial or otherwise, has ever collided with a manned aircraft in U.S. airspace.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Submission Statement**
A sociologist from Occidental College looks at how "anti-gay hate crimes, like violence against women (Mateen also reportedly beat his ex-wife), are tied closely to rigid and hierarchical ideas about masculinity that depend on differentiating 'real' men from women as well as gay and bisexual men."  </TEXT>
