	<TEXT> [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnKZ4pdSU-s) is a performance piece by a man with OCD who lost his girlfriend because of it. 

He mentions how she was really the only reprieve from the awful thoughts he was constantly having. I think it's important to portray the constant barrage of thoughts and associations people with OCD suffer from. I'm not sure how you could really do this graphically, but I hope this might spur some ideas. </TEXT>
