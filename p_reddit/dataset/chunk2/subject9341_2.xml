	<TEXT> The minimum velocity to reach low earth orbit is 9.4 km/s or 9400 m/s. So your velocity upon release from the trebuchet should be at least this amount (in reality it would need to be greater because you will lose some velocity due to drag). Assuming the trebuchet would accelerate you to this velocity in 50 m (this is probably an over estimation) then the acceleration you would experience would be 9400^2 / (2 * 50) = 883600 m/s or 90,160 G which would tear you to pieces (assuming the trebuchet was made of materials which could withstand such forces). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually it can be broken down in to smaller parts, you just need to know where to start. It also takes practice, people who are good at maths don't necessarily have an innate gift. I'd highly recommend going back to learn some of this stuff because it's useful to know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think Pythagoras should be taught the way that HE taught it: to inspire people. It's not really about triangles, it's about the meaning of life, and how to be happy.
 Pythagoras was the first and greatest of all philosophers. Thousands of years before theoretical physics was proven, Pythagoras worked out that everything is made of mathematics. And whereas amateurs like Plato has armchair ideas about fascist philosopher dictatorships, Pythagoras actually created his ideal society in the real world. based on fairness and respect.
 Pythagoras was first and foremost a utopian thinker. He loved math only because it frees the mind: suddenly the world really can make sense and it's beautiful. What a powerful concept! In a world of superstition and violence, Pythagoras brought enlightenment.
 The triangle thing is just a small illustration. For thousands of years people had been building houses, and that involves square things, and that means diagonals across them (for roofs and stuff). People would guess, and houses sometimes fell down. Not nice if its your house. But Pythagoras showed how to get perfect answers. No more houses that fall down! No more measuring! If you know one thing (e.g. the sides of your house) then you already know the diagonal without measuring it.
 The triangle principle, and others like it, describe the entire universe! By knowing a simple thing you can know far more. You can comprehend the entire universe, and have the power to build, to invent, to bend reality to your will! Pythagoras isn't about triangles, he's about life, the universe and everything!
 It makes me sad when Pythagoras is taught in math class: as if anybody cares about triangles. Nobody cares about triangles! We care about the future, about making sense of the world, about building stuff that actually works. The triangle theorem (which was probably not even invented by him) is just a symbol of a much bigger principle.

What a fantastic quotation!

	<TEXT> You probably are intelligent enough, it might be a confidence problem. Learning maths is a little bit like constructing a building, you need solid foundations and you must build each floor in turn. If you don't have the basics down, the more advanced topics will be a mystery. For example to be able to use Pythagoras properly you need to understand algebra, arithmetic, exponents, roots. If you don't understand these, you will struggle with Pythagoras. If you do understand them, then it's only a small step up. </TEXT>

Sending out emails en masse requires little effort, but actually grooming someone to transfer money takes considerable effort. To filter out the reasonably gullible people from the complete fuckwits, they make the scam so obvious that only a walking ape would fall for it. Then they only have to convince the truly stupid to part with their cash. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mayonnaise is an interesting fluid. It's what is known as a [Bingham plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_plastic), so it behaves as a solid under low stress, but behaves like a viscous fluid at high stress. ELI5: when increasing force is applied to it, it behaves as a solid until a certain point where it will start to flow. This means that the mayonnaise won't simply flow out of you, it will all have to be pushed hard.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is an interesting video demonstrating the behaviour of Bingham plastics. </TEXT>
