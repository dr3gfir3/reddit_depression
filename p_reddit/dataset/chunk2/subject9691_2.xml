	<TEXT> Honestly. .The best part of my wedding was just knowing that it was the start of my life with my best friend.  My parents and family never really accepted him until that moment.   It was awesome to be in a room full of people who supported us.  The kiss was freaking amazing too,  though.  :) </TEXT>
