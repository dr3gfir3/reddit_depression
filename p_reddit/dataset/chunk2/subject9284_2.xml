	<TEXT> Obama sent $3B to a DoJ controlled slush fund as a way to give money towards political activism.  They in turn gave, at his direction, the money to Correct the Record, Black Lives Matter, etc.

The 'Sessions' did this or 'Trump did that' are a false flags.
Also, this is why Reddit Admins set a different post from T_D to zero upvotes this morning.  They are being paid to try and hide the story.

	<TEXT> Playing a board of Walker Assault.  Game JUST started and it's 0-0


Suddenly my radar goes fuzzy.  Realizing this is an enemy scout trait, tread cautiously.  I see him, kill him, all good.

Radar goes back to normal.  

Then I think, should my radar go wonky if the game just started?  Isn't that a level 3 trait?  Sooo, then he's hacking?  On XBox1?

I played about 5 or 6 WAs, but only one against this person, most on his team.  Each game he went like 45 - 10 or something.  His worst was probably 30-19.  Hacks?  On XBox1?

Or is Scout the new real deal?   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> James White Deserves SB MVP </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-06 19:43:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> James White was robbed of Super Bowl MVP by NFL Films and the history of Tom Brady

As in they want to have a Tom Brady is the greatest ever story, and his MVP had to be a part of that narrative.

Pats lose that game w/o James White.  They probably lose it w/o Brady too, but come on 

3 TD
2 Pt Conv
SB Record 14 Receptions (beating out players like Jerry Rice, Demaryius Thomas, Wes Welker)
SB record 20 Points
Game High 110 Yards Receiving
29 Yards Rushing (not a lot, but two runs were for scores)
SB Record for OT points, scores, TD's etc

Brady says he'll give him the truck.  James White will have NO Problem affording a 'truck' come next contract.

But Tom Brady should turn down the MVP award and give it entirely, or  at least demand to share it w James White as Co-MVP; in title, officially </TEXT>

I've reset my Xbox 1 S, Reinstalled the game, tested all my network settings (400 upload, 50 download, 55 ms delay, 0%packet loss).  I SHOULD have 1,000 upload and 1,000 download as I'm on Fiber Gigabyte, less than a mile from the telco center.

But, I can't see friends.  They CAN see me.  

Suggestions? Is this just a SWBF E A Server issue? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So The Donald is building a wall, and a pipeline.

And I support those decisions.  Even a pipeline that runs next to Tribal Lands, when done properly can be safe and profitable.

But walls and pipelines need steel.  Walls need metal rebar and pipelines are made from steel.

US Steel, and American firm based in BASED Steeler County (PA) is a top supplier of high grade steel.  Ticker: X

Steel Dynamics is a high grade steel manufacturer producing almost 8 million tons annually.  Based in BASED Indiana.  Ticker: STLD

Allegheny Technologies is a manufacture of specialty metals (like titanium, nickel, cobalt alloys) and of course steel.  Based Pitt, PA.  Ticker: ATI

These are just a few companies that will benefit from The Donald, POTUS.  And. . . They are in states that voted for him :-)

Just thought I'd share for you Pedes too.  Please do your own investing research before investing.

Disclaimer!!! I am long X and STLD but have no position in ATI.  Im not a broker nor a partner, employee or controller in any of these firms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been a Packer Fan since before I could walk.

Growing up in N Wisconsin, w my mom screaming at the TV (THAT WAS A #%*ing FOUL YOU %^**ing REF) I knew that whatever was happening was important.  My mom never swore, and never yelled.  Except when the Packers were on.

When playing pickup football in the neighborhood, I was always John Jefferson and my cousin was James Lofton.  The dynamic duo wide receivers of the Lynn Dickey era.  Sure we didn't win any Super Bowls in those days, and we barely made the playoffs, but dammit, people loved Their Packers.

In the Favre years, winning became more common, and FINALLY in the 1996/97 season Lombardi came back home.

Favre, hate him or love him, I'd still do it all over again (w/o the Mandritch draft though lol).

Fast forward to Rodgers and Company.  Another Homecoming for Lombardi and finally tied the Bears al-time series!  For those of us tracking that when we were 20 games down, it was a long road, but we got there.  

Rodgers has at his helm one of the greatest offenses ever assembled, and like the NFL of late, injuries are more common, but the talent is there.  

Watching Randall Cobb and our D step up last week in a Playoff game was uplifting and impressive.  I'm proud of how they played, and the Reffing, aside from the Nelson hit, was pretty fair.

And although Tiki Barber's 'G is for Greatness' might not be the official history, to all the fans, City of Green Bay, and real-everyday-people owners like you and me, G will always 'stand' for Greatness.  Greatness in the passion and love of our team.  Greatness of character in our players and fans.  Greatness in respect for visiting teams and fans.  And Greatness in our pursuit of bringing Lombardi home again in 2017.

Go.
Pack.
Go.

	<TITLE> Advice on choosing a Vanguard RothIRA fund </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-05 21:20:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have just under $20K in my Roth IRA money market. Basically I've been contributing but haven't bought any funds the past few years.

Have just under $100K in the Windsor Fund (Admiral shares) VWNAX and $50k in Wellington (Investor shares) VWELX.

I have 401k, pension all that jazz and no need for cash.  This is my self directed fun retirement money but having $20k sitting idle seems silly.  But buying the market at DJIA approaching 20k also seems silly.

Based on my current holdings, any advice on other Vanguard funds?  Or wait for a market drop? </TEXT>
