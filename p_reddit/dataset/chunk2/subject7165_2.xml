You truly are a piece of work.  With the level of thinking and glaring lack of perspective you've displayed on this thread, you certainly have no room to be calling anyone stupid, easily distracted, or any other thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well if you really believe that "[s]tupid, easily distracted, easily mislead [sic], weak-minded Americans hav[e] more voting power than their more educated counterparts" -- maybe it's time to start predicting that Democrats will never win another presidential election ever again.

Then again I'd have to question just how intelligent you are when you think that recent -- and near landslide -- Democratic wins in the nearly same "stupid, easily distracted" electorate is "irrelevant."

Pathetic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  law school, passing the bar, practicing with the Children's Defense Fund

None of that means jack shit in the larger scheme of things.  This isn't 1888 when most people didn't make it past third grade.  However, Clinton did graduate from Wellesley and Yale Law School, which are impressive schools.  But in general, graduating law school and passing the bar are not major "accomplishments" in and of themselves.  Even less so now than in the 1970's.

On the other hand, the First Lady, Senator, Secy of State, yeah, that's fantastic. </TEXT>

Hell, it wasn't too long ago when many commentators were seriously discussing that the GOP would never win another presidential election ever again, even in a system where "[s]tupid, easily distracted, easily mislead [sic], weak-minded Americans hav[e] more voting power than their more educated counterparts." </TEXT>

However, I have a feeling that Trump won't sign the order this week.  (I could be wrong, this is just a hunch.)

Anyone else particularly disturbed about the allegation that VP Pence is pressuring the President? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Starting in 1990, some congressional districts were drawn up to explicitly ensure a candidate of color would win.  An example was the Third (now Fifth) Congressional District of Florida.  

This is a double edged sword since it increases minority representation in Congress, but also dilutes the minority vote overall. </TEXT>
