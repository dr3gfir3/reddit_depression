	<TEXT> This is from my Canadian experience... Was called for jury duty a long time ago before I had kids and I was between jobs. I really wanted to be on the jury as it was such a different experience and perfect timing. I sat all day long watching people get called up and whatever excuse they gave they didn't have to serve. It was crazy, just the most mundane things. So I sat there for 7 hours and never got called once. Total bummer. So anyway,  where I was you would have totally been able to get out of jury duty.  </TEXT>
