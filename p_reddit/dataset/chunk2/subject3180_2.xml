	<TEXT> I haven't done Strong Curves so I'll let someone else answer that... but the biggest factor to losing fat is going to be your diet. Make sure you're tracking your food and eating at a deficit - more info on that in the sidebar.

	<TEXT> Personally I'd make smoothies with fruits/veggies and throw in some protein powder (and maybe peanut butter/milk/yogurt). I think that would mostly cover your bases.

If you want something pre-made for convenience, I think Ensure is usually made for old sick people who need protein and vitamins, rather than people looking to lose weight, so that should work as well? :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to the advice others have given, I'm also really intrigued by the concept of [decision fatigue](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?_r=0). 

This is essentially the concept that when you wake up each day, you have a limited amount of energy dedicated to self control/willpower/making good decisions. So the more decisions you have to make throughout the day (should I go out for lunch? where should I go? what should I wear? should I go to the gym today? etc), the more easily you'll give into temptation later. Your brain is basically tired of making those decisions.

I'm experimenting on myself right now by planning and preparing all of my meals in advance, so there's no decision making, I just grab some tupperware. I'm finding it oddly easy to say no to snacks and drinks at work. YMMV but it's interesting. There's a TED talk somewhere too, I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doing this right now and I love it (but too soon to report any results yet). I'm cutting so it helps manage my intake and makes it easier for me to turn down snacks, going out for lunch, etc. Plus it's just so easy to have everything already made, and I can just grab a few tupperwares while I leave for work in the morning.

Edit: also I'm doing a bunch of smaller meals, which I didn't think I'd like, but I actually love knowing that my next meal is only a few hours away. Helps me keep from snacking on other stuff instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree. In general if you're trying to end up "shredded" you'll want to work on growing muscle and losing body fat in separate phases. It's difficult/slow to do those at the same time. This is why most people bulk and then cut.

So you could do that program to gain some muscle (high volume will do that), but you'll want to eat at least at maintenance if not a bit over. Once you've gained some muscle mass, then you'll cut calories to lose body fat. While you're doing that, it will be difficult to hit as much volume when you work out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem! It may not be the case for you but when I've had trouble hitting depth on heavier sets, it was really because I was sort of stopping myself from going deeper because it was so heavy. Deloading and box squats helped. Not being afraid to fail also helps.

You might also try "squat negatives" where you lower the weight in a slow and controlled way, like you normally would, but then just go as deep as you can, and then bail out safely (lower the bar to the safeties). Can you get down to parallel or lower? Can you get back up? May just be too heavy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you get to that depth at any weight? (Goblet squats? Empty bar? Bodyweight?) How wide is your stance? 

With long legs (I have ridiculously long femurs, I feel your pain) it usually takes a combination of ankle mobility (oly shoes help but it might still take some work) and playing around with your stance to get there.

How close are you to wanting to compete? It's likely something that will improve over time.

If neither, just stick with the dumbbells and increase the weight when you can get to 8 reps or so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, inches lost is great, even if you feel like you can't see it (it's hard to see slow changes) so keep focusing on that. 

However, even while lifting, a caloric deficit should lead to weight loss, especially such a large deficit. Do you have a food scale? Do you measure everything, including oils you use to cook, salad dressings, small snacks, etc?

I would actually shoot for a higher calorie limit to make sure you're properly fueled to get the most out of your workouts, but then make sure to religiously measure and weigh everything for at least a little while. I know from experience, it's really easy to forget about that little pat of butter you used to grease a pan, or the oil you drizzled on the veggies, which can easily add hundreds of calories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they have a barbell or even fixed weight barbells, this is one reason people use the barbell - you can add weight 5lbs at a time (or less if you have micro plates). Is that an option?

I sometimes DB bench as an accessory lift, so I'm usually going for more volume anyway, but yeah I usually wait until I can do a set of 8 and then bump up the weight and see how many I can do. </TEXT>

- 1 scoop of protein before I lift in the morning (24g of protein)
- a couple hard boiled eggs after the gym (13g of protein)
- 2 oz of meat at lunch, snacktime, and dinner (~10-15g X 3)
- another scoop of protein + a tablespoon of peanut butter before bed (24 + 4)

Then I just add some veggies and carbs and such to all of that. Today MFP tells me I'll end up at 1611 calories and 127 grams of protein. </TEXT>

Luckily only the handle hit me so I didn't lose a toe, but I guess I have heavy knives because it cracked my toenail in half and starting bleeding like crazy. The worst part was that I had a million different things cooking at that moment, so I had to hobble around the kitchen turning off burners and putting things back in the fridge, leaving trails of blood, before I could take care of it.

It looked like a murder scene, I had to mop the entire floor. I would afraid I wouldn't be able to wear shoes for a week, but I hit a squat PR a couple days later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree with the other poster - the more you measure at home, the better you'll be at estimating elsewhere. Make a salad sometime at home and measure the greens, cheese, and dressing to give you a general sense of what you're getting at work. If you're trying to lose weight, it's better to overestimate (e.g. if you're not sure if you're eating 3 or 4 oz of chicken, go with 4).

If you want to add more protein, you could bring a tupperware of your own shredded chicken and leave it in the work fridge to add on top of your salad, and/or make a protein shake, assuming that still fits within your calories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Examine.com is my go-to for any supplement questions:

http://examine.com/supplements/White+Kidney+Bean+Extract/

It does appear to work, but its potency is quite unreliable and relatively subpar.

 Human studies all show benefit in supplementation with the highest starch containing meal, although the degree of benefit seems highly variable. It is not recommended as a first-line fat burner due to it's inability to induce fat loss, but can be used as a band-aid supplement to a subpar diet like most calorie blockers. </TEXT>
