Full and free journal article [*How Ants Use Vision When Homing Backward*](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(16\)31466-X).

**Highlights:**

* Backward-walking ants rely on celestial but not terrestrial cue memories
* Correction of direction based on terrestrial cues occurs after peeking forward
* The retrieved direction can be transferred into a compass frame of reference
* Ants can decouple their travel direction from their body orientation

**Summary:**

Ants can navigate over long distances between their nest and food sites using visual cues. Recent studies show that this capacity is undiminished when walking backward while dragging a heavy food item. This challenges the idea that ants use egocentric visual memories of the scene for guidance. Can ants use their visual memories of the terrestrial cues when going backward? Our results suggest that ants do not adjust their direction of travel based on the perceived scene while going backward. Instead, they maintain a straight direction using their celestial compass. This direction can be dictated by their path integrator but can also be set using terrestrial visual cues after a forward peek. If the food item is too heavy to enable body rotations, ants moving backward drop their food on occasion, rotate and walk a few steps forward, return to the food, and drag it backward in a now-corrected direction defined by terrestrial cues. Furthermore, we show that ants can maintain their direction of travel independently of their body orientation. It thus appears that egocentric retinal alignment is required for visual scene recognition, but ants can translate this acquired directional information into a holonomic frame of reference, which enables them to decouple their travel direction from their body orientation and hence navigate backward. This reveals substantial flexibility and communication between different types of navigational information: from terrestrial to celestial cues and from egocentric to holonomic directional memories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Brief summary:

The *Arkansaurus fridayi* was discovered in 1972 by a man named Joe Friday who was reportedly searching for the missing bovine when he spotted a fossilized foot on his land in Lockesburg. Crews had churned up tracts of earth to build a road, and Friday noticed a few long toe bones poking through the soil, said ReBecca Hunt-Foster, a paleontologist with the Bureau of Land Management.

The fossils, named after Friday, were sent to the University of Arkansas, where they were studied, reconstructed and displayed in a museum for years.

Now, Hunt-Foster wants *Arkansaurus fridayi* to be recognized as a distinct type of dinosaur, fit with its own scientific name. She recently submitted a paper making her case to a journal for review.  </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Nonhuman primates, our closest biological relatives, play important roles in the livelihoods, cultures, and religions of many societies and offer unique insights into human evolution, biology, behavior, and the threat of emerging diseases. They are an essential component of tropical biodiversity, contributing to forest regeneration and ecosystem health. Current information shows the existence of 504 species in 79 genera distributed in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, and Asia. Alarmingly, ~60% of primate species are now threatened with extinction and ~75% have declining populations. This situation is the result of escalating anthropogenic pressures on primates and their habitatsmainly global and local market demands, leading to extensive habitat loss through the expansion of industrial agriculture, large-scale cattle ranching, logging, oil and gas drilling, mining, dam building, and the construction of new road networks in primate range regions. Other important drivers are increased bushmeat hunting and the illegal trade of primates as pets and primate body parts, along with emerging threats, such as climate change and anthroponotic diseases. Often, these pressures act in synergy, exacerbating primate population declines. Given that primate range regions overlap extensively with a large, and rapidly growing, human population characterized by high levels of poverty, global attention is needed immediately to reverse the looming risk of primate extinctions and to attend to local human needs in sustainable ways. Raising global scientific and public awareness of the plight of the worlds primates and the costs of their loss to ecosystem health and human society is imperative. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Drosophila platonic (plt) males court females, but fail to copulate. Here we show that plt is an allele of scribbler (sbb), a BMP signalling component. sbb knockdown in larvae leads to the loss of approximately eight serotonergic neurons, which express the sex-determinant protein Doublesex (Dsx). Genetic deprivation of serotonin (5-HT) from dsx-expressing neurons results in copulation defects. Thus, sbb+ is developmentally required for the survival of a specific subset of dsx-expressing neurons, which support the normal execution of copulation in adults by providing 5-HT. Our study highlights the conserved involvement of serotonergic neurons in the control of copulatory mechanisms and the key role of BMP signalling in the formation of a sex-specific circuitry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Brief summary for the busy:

In the Namib desert, the land is patterned with mysterious circles, arranged in a regular pattern. Across the expanse, rings of high grass cordon off empty spots of sandy orange ground. The origins of those circles have never been determined.

For years, scientists have debated the cause of these fairy circles, and recently a sharp divide has separated partisans of two competing theories. One gives credit for creating the circles to sand termites; the other to the plants.

Now, a new paper published in Nature suggests that both theories could be true and that the behavior of both sand termites and plants could contribute to creating the haunting pattern that has obsessed so many scientists.

**Abstract:**

An intact forest landscape (IFL) is a seamless mosaic of forest and naturally treeless ecosystems with no remotely detected signs of human activity and a minimum area of 500 km2. IFLs are critical for stabilizing terrestrial carbon storage, harboring biodiversity, regulating hydrological regimes, and providing other ecosystem functions. Although the remaining IFLs comprise only 20% of tropical forest area, they account for 40% of the total aboveground tropical forest carbon. We show that global IFL extent has been reduced by 7.2% since the year 2000. An increasing rate of global IFL area reduction was found, largely driven by the tripling of IFL tropical forest loss in 20112013 compared to that in 20012003. Industrial logging, agricultural expansion, fire, and mining/resource extraction were the primary causes of IFL area reduction. Protected areas (International Union for Conservation of Nature categories I to III) were found to have a positive effect in slowing the reduction of IFL area from timber harvesting but were less effective in limiting agricultural expansion. The certification of logging concessions under responsible management had a negligible impact on slowing IFL fragmentation in the Congo Basin. Fragmentation of IFLs by logging and establishment of roads and other infrastructure initiates a cascade of changes that lead to landscape transformation and loss of conservation values. Given that only 12% of the global IFL area is protected, our results illustrate the need for planning and investment in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation efforts that target the most valuable remaining forests, as identified using the IFL approach. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in! Me too. What a beautiful gif.

The flickering or flashing we're seeing is a warning. It says "Predator, I know you're here! Don't try anything."

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_squid)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

More on that in [this Scientific American article](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/how-the-octopus-creates-instant-3-d-camouflage-on-its-skin/).  

Edit - Folks are asking how they know what colors to change. We actually are not sure. There was a great [Mental Floss interview](http://www.mentalfloss.com/article.php?id=61532) with an aquarist:

Good question, and one that researchers are still trying to answer. They know Cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish) match their skin to their surroundings using their eyesight. But whats perplexing is that octopuses are actually colorblind. Its possible they can distinguish between different polarization of light better than humans can, but the exact method for how they identify color is unknown. 

Also, not Unidan! I'm a woman (Uni is a guy) and I've been around and answering comments and questions (on another account /u/Alantha) at the same time and with Unidan. He's a great guy. We'd bounce comments off of each other before he was chased out. There are many many scientists who are happy to talk about their profession and saying we are all Unidan is insulting. We all went to school, worked relevant jobs, maybe published research or taught or whatever. We worked hard and continue to work hard and deserve to be our own people. Calling every scientist who pops in Unidan is lazy and old hat. Leave the dead horses alone. </TEXT>

"This variation of the reproductive ground plan hypothesis suggests division of labor - the ways social bees cooperate to complete all tasks necessary to keep the colony running - evolved from ancestral gene networks that function to align a female's dietary preferences with the nutrients she needs during different phases of her reproductive cycle," says Kapheim, assistant professor in USU's Department of Biology and the USU Ecology Center. "A major limitation in evaluating this hypothesis is that we know almost nothing about the nutritional needs and preferences of solitary bees, which are most similar to social bees' closest ancestor. Yet, solitary bees have no division of labor." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist digging in!

What a very cool gif! I think most people have a weird idea as to what a barnacle is, but let me break it down for you! 

[Barnacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle) are arthropods (which means jointed foot) and are crustaceans. Like crabs, lobsters, shrimp, etc. These little guys are suspension feeders when adults, but actively swim when larvae.

Inside that nifty shell the animal is laying on its back and sticking its feathery limbs out from the carapace to pull in food. They have 6 pairs of limbs, two antennae, one eye (which likely only sense light/dark changes) and not much else going on outwardly.

[Here is a pretty amazing model of what the animal looks like within the carapace.](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/model-of-barnacle-with-cutaway-showing-internal-organs-closeup-picture-id90116602?s=170667a) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Link to the [full and free journal article](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13854).

Please read at least the abstract before drawing any conclusions from the news source. News often misses important or interesting points and to really understand what the researchers were getting at it's important to understand the journal article. This is of course meant in no offense to the article's writer, but it is a common issue with only reading the news source.



And as always, please direct all comments at the specific content of the original post, or the specific scientific article it is based upon and do not post anecdotal comments.

**Abstract:**

Negative racial stereotypes tend to associate Black people with threat. This often leads to the misidentification of harmless objects as weapons held by a Black individual. Yet, little is known about how bodily states impact the expression of racial stereotyping. By tapping into the phasic activation of arterial baroreceptors, known to be associated with changes in the neural processing of fearful stimuli, we show activation of race-threat stereotypes synchronized with the cardiovascular cycle. Across two established tasks, stimuli depicting Black or White individuals were presented to coincide with either the cardiac systole or diastole. Results show increased race-driven misidentification of weapons during systole, when baroreceptor afferent firing is maximal, relative to diastole. Importantly, a third study examining the positive Black-athletic stereotypical association fails to demonstrate similar modulations by cardiac cycle. We identify a bodybrain interaction wherein interoceptive cues can modulate threat appraisal and racially biased behaviour in context-dependent ways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello and thank you for taking the time to speak with us here today.

Do you have the opportunity to still be creative in the private sector? As scientists we often have questions of our own not directly related to what we are working on currently. Do you have the freedom to pursue anything a little differently or do you have to stick to what the company needs? Often new discoveries are made from unplanned experimentation.

Thank you again for your time, it's appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't mind at all! I grew up with a father who had a great love of nature and the outdoors. He taught me nothing is gross; no spiders, no insects, no slugs, fish or toads or frogs. All things are amazing! I grew up in the New Jersey Pine Barrens and only 20 minutes from the ocean. 

I brought home many animals; snakes, frogs, toads, fish, insects, box tortoises, etc. My father set up a kiddie pool in our backyard and whatever I brought home we'd keep for a day or two and learn as much as we could about that animal. Then we'd return it, well fed, to where I originally found it.

In high school I took as many science courses as I could; marine bio, biology, earth science, environmental science, etc. I then went to college and received my B.S. in Marine and Environmental Biology and Policy. I worked for my state's Fish and Wildlife program studying endangered shore birds. I worked in a mosquito genetics lab for a couple of years afterward. Then I worked as an environmental scientist for a few years, left, worked with endangered grassland birds and moved on to graduate school. In grad school I studied arthropod sensory ecology and how predator cues affect prey behavior; I worked with wolf spiders, pill bugs, potato bugs (terrestrial isopods), German roaches and field crickets. I received an M.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Now I teach a few courses at my local university and am currently working on two research projects while considering getting my PhD. </TEXT>

[Gelada baboons](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/gelada/) (*Theropithecus gelada*) are definitely one of the more  baboon species. I love their manes!

They are also called the "bleeding heart baboons" because of this amazing [skin patch](https://thedeepestlove.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/rod-waddington-from-kergunyah-australia-simien_mtns_6174572833.jpg) on their chests. They look incredibly majestic, in my opinion.

Endemic (found only in) to the high mountain meadows of Ethiopia they are found all over the steep mountains and sleep together on ledges. 

They eat grass and are the last surviving species of ancient grazing primates ([grass blades make up to 90% of their diet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelada#Range_and_ecology)). They live in small family groups run by a dominant male, though when he is too old the dominant female has the last word in kicking him out, to be replaced by a younger more fit male. He doesn't usually go without a fight!

Like most primates, they communicate with sound and facial expressions, spend a lot of time [grooming each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelada#/media/File:D%C5%BEelady.jpg) and are prone to squabbles. The gif is from a [Nato Geo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDT0xSsrVIg) and is showing a dominant male protecting his harem from a bunch of interloping young males. </TEXT>

Happily, according to the [IUCN Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/10985/0) these beautiful animals are of "least concern" though in South Asia this species is locally threatened by habitat loss, largely through commercial logging and the conversion of land to agricultural use. It is also threatened by conversion of plantation lands to make way for human settlements and changes in cropping pattern.

They are insectivorous and nest in small groups of 2 - 6 and their roosts can be found in the suspended nests of weaver finches and sunbirds or under the eaves of huts.

Starling murmurations are so amazing! The flow of the starlings as they move together is really something to behold. It's spellbinding!

[Starling wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling)

Cornell's All About Bird site has a wonderful article about Starling Murmurations [here](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/how-do-starling-flocks-create-those-mesmerizing-murmurations/). Dr. Grainger Hunt describes the usual why in the article:

Almost always, Hunt writes, these aerial spectacles are caused by a falcon near the edge of the flock. It turns out that the beauty of a murmurations movements often arises purely out of defense, as the starlings strive to put distance between themselves and the predator..

For even more reading Wired has an easy to understand article on murmuration [here](https://www.wired.com/2011/11/starling-flock/) as well. </TEXT>

That very angry little guy or gal is a [frilled-neck lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydosaurus) (*Chlamydosaurus kingii*), also known as "Frillies", and native to...wait for it....Australia (and New Guinea)! Like most of the sassy animals I see here and in other subs. A frill-necked lizard was featured on the reverse of the Australian 2-cent coin until 1991. Some folks keep them as pets.

These lizards are actually fairly large at 85 cm (2.79 ft) in total length. They flair their frills out like this when they are trying to scare off a predator to make themselves look larger and it looks like it's not working so well for this man or lizard. ;)

[National Geographic fun fact](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/frilled-lizard/):

Besides defense, this lizard's colorful frill may be used to help regulate body temperature.

Happily, according to the [IUCN Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/10985/0) these beautiful animals are of "least concern" though in South Asia this species is locally threatened by habitat loss, largely through commercial logging and the conversion of land to agricultural use. It is also threatened by conversion of plantation lands to make way for human settlements and changes in cropping pattern. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist flocking in.

Starling murmurations are so amazing! The flow of the starlings as they move together is really something to behold. It's spellbinding!

[Starling wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling)

Cornell's All About Bird site has a wonderful article about Starling Murmurations [here](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/how-do-starling-flocks-create-those-mesmerizing-murmurations/). Dr. Grainger Hunt describes the usual why in the article:

Almost always, Hunt writes, these aerial spectacles are caused by a falcon near the edge of the flock. It turns out that the beauty of a murmurations movements often arises purely out of defense, as the starlings strive to put distance between themselves and the predator..

For even more reading Wired has an easy to understand article on murmuration [here](https://www.wired.com/2011/11/starling-flock/) as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in! As much as I love the ocean, I'd also be a little freaked out surfing at night.

This beautiful bioluminescence is caused by [phytoplankton](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/phyto.html). There are two main classes of phytoplankton; [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate) and [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom). Dinoflagellates are our bioluminescent phytoplankton! A common species is the [*Noctiluca scintillans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctiluca_scintillans), commonly known as the sea tinkle (I know, it's adorable). [Here's what it looks like up close](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/64/94/e9/6494e9f7bab8586dccae2f15c44cc7e8.jpg).
The bioluminescence is produced throughout the cytoplasm by a [luciferin-luciferase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin#Dinoflagellate) reaction in organelles called [scintillons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate#Bioluminescence).  

As I am sure you know, some marine animals also bioluminesce! Common examples are:

*  the squid [*Abralia veranyi*](http://ocean.si.edu/sites/default/files/styles/blog_photo/public/photos/2.09_P08_G10_Abraliabigger.jpg?itok=KYQhDjVX)
* various species of [lantern fish](http://biolum.eemb.ucsb.edu/organism/pictures/myctophid1.jpg)
* [angler fish species](http://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/984/135/50544_1_1280x720_640x360_177552451962.jpg)
* [googly eyed glass squid](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm0f9j7AQA1qin08mo1_500.jpg) (*Teuthowenia pellucida*)
* [vampire squid](https://media.giphy.com/media/s62zb1ouMjHxK/giphy.gif) (*Vampyroteuthis infernalis*)
* many many jellyfish or jellies (both words are still used, obviously they are not fish); [*Aequorea victoria*](http://www.dmlim.net/img/aeq/RaskoffAequorea.jpg), [*Aurelia aurita*](https://1nlbgh367fhx33e65vxs7rl8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Moon-JellyFish.jpg), [*Bolinopsis infundibulum*](http://68.media.tumblr.com/312506db6d05e9ce8962a26f9bac91fd/tumblr_nviwvrGW1K1ue1k7zo1_1280.jpg), etc.

That very angry little guy or gal is a [frilled-neck lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydosaurus) (*Chlamydosaurus kingii*), also known as "Frillies", and native to...wait for it....Australia (and New Guinea)! Like most of the sassy animals I see here and in other subs. A frill-necked lizard was featured on the reverse of the Australian 2-cent coin until 1991. Some folks keep them as pets.

These lizards are actually fairly large at 85 cm (2.79 ft) in total length. They flair their frills out like this when they are trying to scare off a predator to make themselves look larger and it looks like it's not working so well for this man or lizard. ;)

[National Geographic fun fact](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/frilled-lizard/):

Besides defense, this lizard's colorful frill may be used to help regulate body temperature.

[The babies are actually pretty cute!](http://rivista-cdn.reptilesmagazine.com/135105802.jpg?ver=1400005992)

Some folks even keep them as pets. Reptiles Magazine has a [Care Sheet](http://www.reptilesmagazine.com/Care-Sheets/Frilled-Lizard-Care-Sheet/) on them. </TEXT>

Evolution definitely rules. It's one of my favorite courses to teach! This little [kangaroo rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_rat) also rules. 

These little guys and gals are native to western North America. They are excellent jumpers, as we've seen, and can jump up to 9 feet (2.75m) in one jump! They also have excellent hearing and can [detect even the relatively silent flight of owls](https://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/oz/long-fact-sheets/krat.php).

This gif is from the first high speed video capture of a Mohave rattlesnake ([*Crotalus scutulatus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_scutulatus)) lunging at a Merriam's kangaroo rat ([*Dipodomys merriami*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat)) in the New Mexico desert.

	<TEXT> Crows are highly intelligent birds and with that intelligence comes a need for stimulation. They get bored, just like we get bored or any other animal with free time not devoted to foraging, mating or sleeping.

Crows are frequently seen doing silly things to keep themselves amused. For instance:

[Sledding down a roof on a piece of plastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRnI4dhZZxQ)

[Rolling down a snowy car's windshield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ta33bMB70)

What's fascinating is, at the time of this video, this is [the first time ants have been seen to use a daisy-chain system](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/scientists-cannot-explain-this-crazy-ant-behavior-but-they-love-it/379390/) to transport large prey. Not that they have not chained together in other ways, but this is a first for daisy chains. 

According to the Atlantic article, I linked above:

Helen McCreery, a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, [recently published a paper on all kinds of cooperative transport strategies in ants](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00040-013-0333-3). In it she explains that at least 40 genera of ants work together to transport things, from two ants grasping something together to [weaver ant workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AweT5kro6jY) who band together to collectively carry birds, bats, and snakes vertically up tree trunks.
