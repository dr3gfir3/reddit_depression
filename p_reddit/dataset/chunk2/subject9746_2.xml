	<TEXT> George RR Martin is definitely one of the best in my opinion even if he only releases a book every 6 or 7 years  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hard for me to narrow it down to just one so I'll give my top 3 from recent reads/favorite books

1. "She was the type of girlfriend God gives you young, so you'll know loss the rest of your life." *The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao* This one really hits home for me because I threw away a relationship with the most incredible person I've ever met and I'll never forgive myself for it. 

2. "What if our world worked differently? Suppose we could tell her: 'I didn't mean what I just said,' and she would say: 'It's okay, I understand,' and she would not turn away, and life would really proceed as though we had never said that thing? We could remove the damage but still be wiser for the experience." *Braid* This one is from the game Braid but I figured it was relevant since it's from the short story within the game. This quote also resonated with me.

3. "So many vows...they make you swear and swear. Defend the king. Obey the king. Keep his secrets. Do his bidding. Your life for his. But obey your father. Love your sister. Protect the innocent. Defend the weak. Respect the gods. Obey the laws. It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or the other. *A Clash of Kings* One of my favorites from A Song of Ice and Fire </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Spoilers for A Dance With Dragons*

The Epilogue chapter in A Dance With Dragons by George RR Martin sent chills through me when I read it. 

"He glimpsed movement, heard the soft scuffling sound of slippered feet on stone. A child emerged from a pool of darkness, a pale boy in a ragged robe, no more than nine or ten. Another rose up behind the Grand Maester's chair. The girl who had opened the door for him was there as well. They were all around him, half a dozen of them, white-faced children with dark eyes, boys and girls together. And in their hands, the daggers."  </TEXT>
