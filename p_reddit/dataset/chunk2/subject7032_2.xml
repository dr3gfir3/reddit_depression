	<TEXT> "Well of course you're depressed. You never leave the house." 

"Your life isn't over just because hers is. I'm sorry but it's true." 

"Don't give up hope. You're going to meet someone else and be just as happy as you ever were."   

*Just as happy*. 

I'm tired of hearing it. What I'm going through - what I'm feeling - it's nobody's business but my own. I don't even know how to begin opening up to anyone who isn't Natalie. Ten years of feeling her warmth pressed against me when I wake. Ten years of whispering to each other in the dark. Ten years of making plans which will never be fulfilled. 

Nine months of drinking until I pass out on the couch with the TV on. I haven't been able to sleep in the bed we shared since breast cancer stole my wife from me. Hell, I've barely been able to sleep at all, and by the way people talk to me, I know they can tell.  

They're right of course, but that only makes it harder. *Knowing* they're right and still being unable to do anything about it is such a frustrating feeling - like realizing the right answer after you've already turned in your test. But I'm working through the grief in my own way. It has been a confusing time for me, but I've started keeping this journal to help me process my thoughts. While I will never forget her, in time I will learn to move on. 

---

I'm meeting someone for dinner tonight. I won't call it a date - it probably is, but I don't want to put my mind in that place yet. Sarah, the daughter of an older client, is in town and I've promised to entertain her for the evening. I guess she has some self-esteem issues and I'm supposed to make her feel better about herself. We've chatted a few times and she's laughed at some of the things I said (even though I know they weren't funny). I would have even called her beautiful at a time when I still looked at girls that way. Well, here goes nothing...

---

Why the fuck didn't I listen to myself. I knew it was too soon. I felt tense the moment I sat down with her. I should have just left then. Everything was going fine though - more than fine she was fantastic - but then she started humming that damn 'my heart will go on' song. The one song stuck in her head just had to be the first song Natalie and I danced to at our wedding. What are the chances? 

I feel like an idiot for jumping up and racing to the bathroom. I don't know how long I stayed in there, but I was half-hoping she would be gone when I came out. To her credit, Sarah just laughed it off and acted like nothing happened. 

She did ask one strange thing though: she asked what Natalie would have thought about her... what an awkward silence that was. All I could manage was "My wife would have been happy to see me having a good time." That was a lie, of course. I couldn't exactly tell her that Natalie was the jealous type - if she knew I was out on a "date" now, then six feet of dirt wouldn't be enough to stop her. Sarah is so sweet to still worry about that even with Natalie gone...  

---

We're getting drinks again. She was even the one to invite me. I can't believe it. Natalie is the only one to ever chase me before. I've heard girls sometimes find men who are suffering to be the most attractive. Our indifference gives them a challenge - our damage gives them something to fix. I'm honestly excited about it. Even if nothing else happens, this will be good for me. 

She actually reminds me of Natalie a lot. The way she cups my hand in hers when she leans in to talk - and then there's the way she bites her lip when she's holding back a smile. She even wears the same kind of long dress with the high belt my wife used to wear, although she has the type of body which would do well in something more revealing...

Now that I think about it, Sarah and Natalie really have a lot in common. You don't think that... no it's impossible. Natalie is gone. I wanted to move on, right? And that's never going to happen by entertaining such ridiculous thoughts.   

--- 

Okay this is getting weird. Sarah won't stop mentioning Natalie. She spent the whole evening asking about how we met, and what I liked about her, and how we spent our time together. It was hard enough talking about my dead wife on a date, but then Sarah would stare at me as though she was analyzing my every answer.  

How am I supposed to forget Natalie like this? *No! Not forget! I didn't mean forget*... I'll never forget... but I think I *want* to. Is that so wrong? If thinking about her brings me nothing but sadness, is it so wrong to want to be happy? 

Natalie would have thought so. I promised I would never love anyone like I loved her. I promised she could never be replaced. Could she really still be holding me to that promise? What if Sarah was only a test - what if Natalie is still watching me, waiting for me to fail? I need to go for a walk. 

---

Natalie is coming over to my place tonight. I mean Sarah - I mean Natalie - I mean - 

The girl won't stop calling me. I'm getting text messages every ten minutes. Whatever I turn the conversation to, she always redirects it back to my dead wife. Natalie is still with me, I know it. She doesn't want me to move on. 

When she comes over tonight, I'm going to ask her straight out. If she says she's Sarah - if she says she isn't my wife - I'll leave it at that. 

But if she admits her spirit is still here... I don't know. I'll do whatever I can to help her find peace. 

---

Natalie has traveled to the other side. I'm finally free. For the first time since her death, her presence is finally gone. 

I didn't have the courage to ask the girl right away. I could tell she was reserved too, so we both had a couple of drinks. And I knew I needed to ask, but it still felt so awkward and wrong, so I just kept drinking. Finally I was able to push the words out: 

"Are you really Sarah, or are you Natalie's spirit?" 

"I'm everything she was," she said, and she kissed me. I closed my eyes, and I could taste Natalie's lips. I ran my fingers through Natalie's hair, and felt my wife's hands on my chest. 

It was so good to hold her again, even if this was the last time. It was so good to feel her skin beneath my hands. It was so good to choke the life out of her, sending her spirit back to rest.   

I hope she stays gone. This is the third time I've had to send Natalie back to the other side. I'm working through my grief in my own way though, and once Natalie has finally let go of me, I think I'll be able to let go of her too. As long as I have a body beside me, I think I can finally sleep in my bed again tonight.

	<TEXT> I found the first floater when I was seven years old. It had washed up on the shore about a hundred yards from my family's summer house. It still looked mostly human - a bit swollen and decomposed, but whole enough for me to immediately recognize what it as. 

Even as a kid, I was never very squeamish. I used to watch my father skin the deer he caught on his hunting trips, and I would clean my own fish whenever I reeled one in from the salty lake. Finding a human body was the best thing that could have happened to me that summer. 

I thought about telling my parents, but there's no way they would let me play with it. Heck, they might even ban me from going down to the water at all, a thought which my seven-year-old brain equated to nuclear holocaust, an asteroid destroying the earth, or other disasters of similar magnitude. 

So I did what any clear thinking seven year old would do. I gathered up all the other kids I knew and charged them 5$ each to poke it with a stick. The salt water preserved it well enough for us to stomach the smell, but poking it would release some of the bloated gas still trapped in the carcass. I told them they could have their money back if they could lick it without throwing up. 

No-one got their money back. I made 60$ before one of the little snitches told his mother and she called the police. 

---

Next summer when I came back, the first thing I did was race back to the same spot. Sure enough, there had been two more bodies to wash up over the winter. These must have been sitting out in the sun for awhile though, because I couldn't even get close to them. 

My father had followed me that time, and I wasn't allowed to have any fun. The police said these bodies must be new, since they would have been completely rotten if they had been down there for a year. 

--- 

Over the next 10 years, there had been another three bodies found beside the lake. Each was slightly more decomposed than the last, but the police still insisted they had to be separate incidents because they were all still too fresh.  

None of them could be identified, and as they didn't fit any missing persons within the entire state, the police had no leads to discover who was dumping the bodies. They had given up, but I was never able to put the mystery out of my mind. 

I had my own theory. I decided those people didn't just die in the lake - they lived in it too. I thought that when they die, they float to the surface just like when humans die, they're buried in the ground. In retrospect the idea didn't really make sense, but it had started forming when I was so young that I refused to let go until the mystery had been resolved. 

---

When I was in college I became SCUBA certified for the sole purpose of finding where those bodies were coming from. I rented my own equipment and went back to that lake the summer of my freshman year. 

The water was incredibly buoyant from all the salt, and it took almost 20 pounds of weights before I would finally sink to the floor. It was slow progress working my way through the lake - six separate dives before I found what I didn't even know I was looking for. 

[*A sunken plane*](http://i.imgur.com/AP2to7K.jpg). I don't know how long it had been down here, but it looked rusted as shit. One of the doors had completed rusted off, and I was able to enter and look around. 

There were two more bodies inside, no-more than skeletons now. The inside of the plane was compartmentalized almost like it was broken into sealed jail cells. 

The locks on some of the cells had long since rusted open, and I'm guessing these are where the floaters came from. If they were in their own pressurized air chambers, then that explains how they were preserved for so long. As the plane deteriorated, they must have broken free and floated to the surface one by one. 

My most important discovery was the black box - although it was painted bright orange so it's a pretty stupid name. I brought it back with me and swam to the surface to research my findings. 

---

The plane was a [Douglass C-47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_C-47_Skytrain), which was used for military transport during World War 2. They were still being used for decades afterward though. Some remained operational even up to 2012, so I still don't know how long it's been there. 

The flight data recorder had completely deteriorated, but the cockpit voice recorder still had some salvageable tape. Most of it was fuzzy or jumpy, but here is what I have. 

*"164, Roger*" (Something I couldn't make out)

*"Unable to make out your last message. Please repeat."*

*"It's out. Repeat - one of them has gotten out.*" 

*"Has the cockpit been comprised?"*

*"Negative. Cell block is*" (couldn't hear).
 
*"Please repeat, Captain.*" 

*"Repeat - cell block is compromised. It's letting the others out. Fucking Christ*" 

*"Remain calm, Captain. Can you neutralize the test subject?"* 

*"Not without compromising cockpit - how far am I from the landing field?"*

(Something unintelligible)

*"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"*

(something unintelligible) *"... not granted permission land."*

*"Well then what the fuck am I supposed to do?*"

(something something) *"Mission terminated. Thank you for your service, Captain.*"

*"My service ain't over until I bring this bird down.*"

*"You're ordered to force collision. Test subjects must not escape.*" 

*"Like hell I am. I'm bringing her down into some water now. Request rescue operations.*" 

*"Mission terminated. Rescue operation denied.*" 

---

After that, all I could hear was engine sounds. It went on for about five minutes, and I was about to stop listening when I heard something like a snarling tiger. 

I guess I haven't changed that much since I was a kid, because I still don't want to bring this into the police. I've got another dive planned next week, and I'm going to try to break open the remaining cell blocks to [get a look inside.](http://facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).
