	<TEXT> Cause he's older now. And they wish they still had Delly. No one in that team is a legit playmaker outside of Bron and ISO heavy kyrie. 

Though that team has some severely overpaid players. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for a calm response. Real question  for ya. Do you feel a lot of what LeBron has done is somewhat manufactured? Like he plans this shit out. Things he does, things he says or doesn't say? To build his "legacy"?

	<TEXT> Eye test shows he's been pretty darn awesome. Though he needs some work on the defensive end as it always seems he gets turned around or unable to fight through screens. But on the offensive side dude looks to be getting the hang of it. Banging threes. Making passes. Not taking contested shots.

Dude gonna develop into a solid baller. </TEXT>
