	<TEXT> I like to take opportunities to share science facts and other things with my kids (Yeah, I'm THAT kind of dad). For example, when I'm out at night with my young'uns, I like to fire up the ISS finder app and point out the ISS or other bodies. 

What are some other apps that I can use to show them the world around them, or which are fun and educational?

Thanks!

Edit: the kids are 8 and 14 </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does this mortgage refinance offer make sense? (lower rate and monthly payment by longer duration) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-05 21:01:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I received an offer from a third party affiliated with my home mortgage lender.

Currently, I am paying on $156,357 at 5.5% for the next 324 months, resulting in a monthly Principle and Interest payment of $927. The offer is for 4.250% rate (and says in parenthesis next to it, it says 4.31% APR) for 360 months, resulting in a claimed P I payment of 769. 

When I do the math, it seems to be a lower total amount despite the longer duration. Is this a good deal or not? If I plan on moving in a few years, I'd have a larger amount to pay off, so it seems like a long term benefit and a short term gain, with the only detriment being if I move.

Edit: this is an "IRRRL" that says it's reusing the entitlement from my original VA home loan </TEXT>

It was a very simple game, not as in-depth as something like civilization or something.

	<TITLE> (California) Question about spousal access to IRA </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-16 06:39:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My mother--in-law's just begun what promises to be a bitter and painful divorce. In order to pay her medical bills, she withdrew $2000 that my father-in-law deposited into an IRA in her name using her social security number (or, rather, originally under his SS# in error, but changed it to hers long ago). There's currently $6000 in the account, but she only withdrew the $2000.

About an hour later her husband called her, angry that she had taken the money. He had called (most likely to try to take the $2000 himself) but was told that she had already done so. She's wondering if her husband was allowed to receive that information (I suspect yes) and if he's able to take the rest of the money.

Thanks for any information- it would really help put her mind at ease. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [California] In-laws divorcing; what can my mother-in-law expect? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-15 21:06:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, /r/legaladvice! Long time listener, first time caller. 

To separate fact from opinion, I'll start with opinion. My in-laws are getting divorced after 20 years. They both have a part in it, but the way my father-in-law (FIL) initiated it left my mother-in-law (MIL) in a pretty bad situation. He's never been a great guy, to his wife or kids, so this is pretty consistent with his character.

To stick with facts: About a week ago, FIL left the house and didn't come back. He calls MIL after a few days and tells her that he's filing for divorce, and that she needs to get a third mortgage on the house so they can sell it and split the money (That's relayed through MIL, so that might not be accurate), but then says that he might come and stay on the property but will not stay in the house. Yesterday, she received the divorce paperwork, which his mother paid for.

She's disabled, so she won't be able to provide for herself. And she hasn't worked for many years, so she doesn't think she can draw social security. She's agreed to see a lawyer for a free consultation, which should answer some of her questions, but there's some things that I don't understand:

Would she be able to hire a lawyer from the (little bit of) money in their joint account? Could he? Does the person that gets to the money first get the better lawyer?

She suspects that he has money that she doesn't know about- he never shared financial information with her. If he has "hidden money" and uses that to hire a good lawyer, is she just left at a disadvantage?

How are assets and debt split in CA? Their house is upside-down already, will they lose out on that? He has a few properties that he inherited from his father (he was out of the will, she talked to his father and patched things up so he was back in); how would that be treated?

He no longer works (retired) and has limited income. Would he be obligated to pay alimony after the assets are split (stocks, the property, etc)?

Thank you for any information.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> P.G.T. Beauregard, Civil War </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-14 20:16:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the US Civil War, the Confederate Forces under P.G.T. Beauregard found themselves severely outnumbered at Corinth in May of 1862. Maj. Gen. Henry W. Hallecks's army laid siege to their position with an overwhelming force of 100,000 men. However, upon reaching the Beauregard's fortifications, Halleck was struck by the apparent strength of the garrison forces. Camping for the night in order to consider strategy, he was concerned about the possibility of attacking a fortification with his own inferior numbers.

His concern was compounded when one of his commanders on the left flank of the position wrote that "The enemy is re-enforcing heavily, by trains, in my front and on my left. The cars are running constantly, and the cheering is immense every time they unload in front of me. I have no doubt, from all appearances, that I shall be attacked in heavy force at daylight." Similarly ominous were the imposing silhouettes of the Confederate artillerists standing by their guns, backlit by the many campfires.

It wasn't until the next morning that it was discovered that Beauregard's entire army, consisting of only 50,000 men, had retreated during the night. The retreat was orderly and methodical, and was masked by a train running back and forth along the Memphis   Charleston tracks, while the men cheered and played taps (the single band shifted from location to location during the night). To complete the illusion, fires were kept burning by a small group of men until morning, drummers were left to beat the reveille and stuffed dummies bravely manned the guns with painted on grins.

The Federal forces were prevented from comprehending the true intentions of the Confederate forces because key information was denied to them. In addition, Deception (often found hand in hand with OPSEC) was successfully used to mask the operation.  </TEXT>

The case study for the presentation addresses a penetration test performed against a large high
technology firm at their request. The goal of the test was to simulate an industrial espionage
attack, within the funding parameters. A comprehensive attack strategy was used to simulate an
attack as accurately as possible. The attack included the use of Open Source Research, obtaining
a position as a temporary employee within the target, misrepresentation of responsibilities by the
temporary, abuse of physical access, internal hacking, internal coordination and facilitation of
external hackers, and straight external hacking.

Anyone know any good examples of breaches (preferably that resulted in a loss of sensitive information) due to non-technical means? </TEXT>

There are four adults and two children in a wood frame military tent, which is itself reinforced and insulated by that spray-on foam that they use in the desert theaters. The door is deadbolted from the outside,  but there is no locking mechanism, and there are three ventaliation holes in the roof that are covered with a thin wire mesh. Inside, there are several cots, a battery-operated lanturn, a box of MREs and bottles of water. The ground is canvas over compacted dirt.

With a liberal application of fiction, how would you escape from that situation in a reasonable amount of time (like during the night)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I'm at home depot or similar store, I see huge amounts of river rock. Where do they get it from? Do they actually cull it from rivers (it seems like you could only go down so deep before they're no longer smooth and attractive) or do they accelerate the natural process with high-pressured water? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the G-staff level (at least at my location), each section has its own call sign with the "Lead" root. So G1 Actual would be "Lead 1", The G2 would be "Lead 2" and so on.

What would the G6 be? The G6 can't be "Lead 6", because that's the Commander's call sign... What's a good one for the 6 element? 

Similar question, do "9" and "0" normally denote anything?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If one is writing a work of fiction, such as a short story or novel, what is the legality of using actual business or product names? 

I don't mean in a derogatory manner, so less of "Bob went to McDonald's, even though they support Al Qaeda and put ground up babies in their beef," and more "Todd hid in the Texaco station and ate slim-jims until the zombies passed."

How can one legally use real products or businesses in fiction? </TEXT>

Using random account names, they're editing the user talk pages with random gibberish, but most have "almost links". For example, one has some rambling incoherent text (surely generated), but then has:

    ?f=71 t=21239
    /User:Hb0rh6hr1gd#design_appraisement
    /User:Hb2dc2hr1wd#how_to_face_difficu

while another has

?mod=viewthread tid=1328 pid=34164 page=37 extra=page=1#pid34164

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I remember there was a thread about this some time ago, where people were discussing what it was like to receive this notification. There's a law, at some level, saying that psychiatrists have to notify the potential victim when a likely threat is made. So if, in therapy, someone says that they're planning on killing their coworker, there has to be some level of notification.

It's not "mandated reporting", although that's part of the requirement. I believe it's a last name (a la megan's law), but I'm not sure. </TEXT>

Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.
'"C:\Users\(me)\AppData\Local\rttevjmgloi.exe"' is not recognized as an interna
l or external command,
operable program or batch file.

I had already removed that nasty file, I just don't like the idea that it's still trying its nastiness. Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember seeing this a few years back- there was some well-dressed older gentleman singing happy birthday to his long-since dead former girlfriend (?) while in his garden. I don't know if this is true or not, but the story that went along with it is that he was a registered sex offended. Anyone got a lead on this? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a strange one, at least for me. Apologies if this isn't the right sub.

I have a phillips flatscreen TV that's plugged into the DVR via the component cables. When I leave anything (so far the blue ray player, laptop and the xbox) plugged in, the TV will lose sound *sometimes* when it's turned on. Not every time, and the length of time it's off doesn't seem to have anything to do with it. If I unplug the hdmi cable and restart the tv, the sound works fine, and I can plug the cable back in with no issues.

Any ideas? </TEXT>

Is there any way that they could live on the same drive and give me a dual boot option? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know this is a long shot, but I need to make a very basic video at work, just something that merges audio (most likely from [here](http://dig.ccmixter.org/music_for_film_and_video?dig-query=hero) ) with some pictures and superimposed text.

The challenge? Our IT folks have the computers on lockdown and I can't install any software, and windows movie maker isn't a part of the standard load. The process to get those things changed is a bit longer than I have available.

Does anyone here have any thoughts on what I could do here? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Full disclosure: I'm working on my capstone project for my BS in Applied Management before applying to the MBA program. 

How can one define performance metrics specific to a watercraft detailing company? Given the wide range of conditions and types of watercraft, I wouldn't think that time would be usable metric (specifically, one couldn't set a timeframe of three hours for a 26' boat and expect that to apply to a relatively clean and a very dirty boat!).

The only performance metric that I can think of is the final product- a random inspection looking for thoroughness. Even then, I'm wondering how to define that metric. 90% "clean" 99% of the time? passes inspection 95% of the time?  </TEXT>
