	<TEXT> What a crook. He had an affair (bad, but not necessarily resignation worthy on its own if consensual), but then had the nerve to spend the people's money to cover it up and save himself the embarrassment. Especially hypocritical from a so-called "fiscal conservative". I'm glad he's getting the justice he deserves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well this really is a challenge. Hard to actually solve this without resorting to ASB. The only thing I could think of is maybe in an alternate timeline slaves are mainly taken from only Muslim sections of West Africa, and a lot more of them are taken by the slave trade. If enough slaves were imported, they could become a majority in a couple of southern states, but I don't see that realistically happening. If this was the case though, you would obviously see more numerous and successful slave revolts, weakening the confederacy significantly. This would probably be occurring even before the Civil War. Likewise, in the revolutionary war, Britain would likely appeal to the enslaved population more intensely, encouraging them to help them in the war in return for their garunteed freedom. This could have been an effective strategy if slaves were so numerous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, the Portuguese Restoration War would have to have never happened, and the Iberian Union survives, with its members fully integrated. The French phase of the Thirty Years' War goes terribly wrong for France, and Spain is able to take southern portions of France in the 1640s. The Peace of Westphalia goes very well for them, although they begrudgingly release the Netherlands, fed up with obnoxious rebellions. Meanwhile, many of Europe's Protestant states have been forcibly converted back. Spain has made itself into an even greater power, and now is the most powerful in Europe. France is weakened severely, and has lost most of its Mediterranean coast. They probably never take Corsica in this scenario, and Genoa has it for the moment. Sometime over the next hundred years, Naples either goes free or goes to Austria. It is possible that in this timeline, Italian nationalists reach out to Spain for help instead of France in the mid 1800s, letting Spain keep Sicily and Sardinia, and giving them Corsica. Later, since Spain is still the greatest colonial power and was never trampled by Napoleon, they get a large chunk out of North Africa. The Sahel is basically there's for the taking, and they've made significant gains even before the scramble for Africa. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, considering Gran Colombia didn't even stay together, and Bolivar wasn't the one who liberated Argentina(San Martin) or Chile(O'Higgins), an empire from Panama to Patagonia would be an incredible challenge.

But, if Gran Colombia stayed together (not too unfeasible), but with Bolivar as its monarch, I can definitely see the easy acquisition of Bolivia and Peru. The biggest challenge comes with Argentina and Chile. It would really all depend on how genuinely sincere their leaders were about Latin American nationalism, and how willing they were to disregard republicanism. But, since this is a hypothetical, let's just say Chile and La Plata both saw it in their interest to join with Bolivar.

This new Empire would become the greatest power in the New World, given time to consolidate. It would probably wage frequent wars with Brasil, usually winning, in an attempt to unite South America. It's hard to say how they would interact with the US or Europe. Regardless, if they could stay together, they would become a full-fledged power at the level of Europe's powerful states. They may not be as active in international affairs, taking an isolationist approach like the US. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Circa 1904, Britain was allied with Japan in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and France had been cultivating an alliance with Russia for a while. If Britain would have officially declared war against Russia at the start of the war, and France had come to their defence, what would be the result? What other major powers may have joined? Germany? The United States? Would the fighting remain concentrated in East Asia, or would a significant European front open up? Finally, how would this impact the European alliance system going into the historical WWI? </TEXT>
