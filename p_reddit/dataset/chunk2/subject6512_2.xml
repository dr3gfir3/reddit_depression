	<TEXT> I asked the same question in this sub roughly two months ago. It gathered a significant number of replies and some useful advice.

https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/4r2iul/wiping_exif_data_from_digital_photographs_isnt/

And your suggestion for a tool to do this is a useful one. Have you considered contacting the Tails team directly? I believe this is their subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/tails/ </TEXT>

They would resist this dark urge to create the tools necessary for a police state. Now, they are putting us all at risk of a much greater danger than terrorism carried out by Muslim extremists. </TEXT>

The good news for Nvidia GPU owners, such as it is, is that while GeForce experience is convenient and centralized, its not actually mandatory to use. You can still download drivers directly from the website, choose optimal game performance settings using in-game menus, and set display settings using Windows options.

	<TEXT> Je gaat er vanuit dat geen bezwaar aantekenen altijd bewust is. Er zijn mensen die niet kunnen lezen, mensen die de post negeren, mensen die niet in de zorgmolen zitten maar technisch gezien wel wilsonbekwaam zijn, er zijn mensen die de taal niet spreken.  
Daar valt allemaal wel wat aan te doen, maar je zult ze nooit allemaal bereiken. Voordat we bezwaar maken, voordat we een keuze maken, en zelfs als we geen keuze maken, wordt er voor ons bepaald dat we geen bezwaar maken en dus mogelijk beschikbaar zijn als donor. *Als* er nabestaanden zijn dan kunnen die mogelijk nog een afweging maken, ja, maar dat doet niets af aan dat er eerst voor ons beslist wordt.  
  
Het probleem had ook opgelost kunnen worden door ons te dwingen te kiezen, niet door voor ons te kiezen. Dat was ook een beperking geweest van onze vrijheid, maar niet een beperking van onze grondrechten. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just adding the last two paragraphs here:

Another hot button is whether so-called lawful access rules, which require telecommunications firms to allow police to install wiretaps, should be expanded to tech firms. It isnt clear if the EUs proposals would include such a change, but the possibility raises the specter of renewed fighting over whether tech firms should be forced to build in back doors to encrypted services, both telecom and tech lobbyists say.

Theres a lot of money that operators invest in data access for authorities, said one telecommunications executive. It should be same services, same obligations. </TEXT>

Generally speaking, we don't like abuse of power by police, or being policed at all, and we don't like being filmed. There is no comfortable position to take on the body cam issue.

But the real reason is probably that I've only submitted this 36 minutes ago, and it has 2 points. Not enough people have seen this for the comment panel to reflect most points of view. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Snowden's lawyer, someone who would know, disagrees:

The biopics September release date matches up with Wizners timetable for mobilizing a clemency appeal to Obama. Were going to make a very strong case between now and the end of this administration that this is one of those rare cases for which the pardon power exists, Wizner said. Its not for when somebody didnt break the law. Its for when they did and there are extraordinary reasons for not enforcing the law against the person.

	<TEXT> Welcome to the sub! And thank you for the compliments.  

As far as I'm concerned both groups as described by you are welcome here, but because we don't focus on general privacy-related content, you probably won't find a lot of discussions about Tails here.
You are more likely to find news stories about drafting of surveillance or data-protection laws, abuse of surveillance powers, data breaches, surveillance capitalism, etc.

I'm looking forward to anything else you decide to contribute to our sub. And good luck tomorrow! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congratulations everyone! We've hit the 1000 subscribers mark, with 10% of you joining in the past 24 hours. Thank you for your contributions. And I would like to thank /u/must_warn_others, /u/TonyQuark, /u/kulkke, and /u/fantastic_comment for their help in making /r/europrivacy what it is today.  
  
**How we got here**

About seven months ago, I decided to see if I could grow /r/europrivacy into a relevant sub for news and discussion about privacy issues related to European countries and the European Union. Before then I hadn't put much of a consistent effort into growing this sub.  

I gave the sub a new look, cleaned up the sidebar, and started submitting content every day. I invited a few others who were active around the same subjects to submit their links here as well.  
You can [see the difference in the stats](https://imgur.com/a/oxdT6) between the time before and after my decision. It's nice to see the hard work paying off. And it's great to know that so many Redditors care about privacy issues and how they relate to Europe.
  

  
**Where we're going**

- We will be submitting ads to /r/subredditads which, if we're selected, will run in the sidebar across Reddit.
- We will be reaching out to more regular contributors to other subreddits like /r/privacy, /r/technology, and /r/europe and ask them to submit here as well.
- We will be reaching out to journalists, activists, and other professionals in the privacy sphere to come submit their work here and interact with you, our subscribers. Hopefully we will become one of the hubs for privacy-related discourse in Europe.  
  

**What you can do**

You can help with making our content more diverse. We are an English-language sub, and as such a majority of the news shared here covers the United Kingdom and the European Union. We would appreciate it very much if we could get contributors from each European country submitting (translated) news about privacy issues in their country. Switzerland is drawing up a new surveillance bill, for example. We would love to know more about that.
You can submit an article in the original language, but with an English title and an English translation in a comment.

Apart from that, we'd like to encourage you to submit your questions and engage in discussion. That's what we're here for!

**Please share any suggestions and criticisms in the comments. We would love to know how we can make this sub better for and with you.**

We're confident that, with your help, we can hit the 2000 subscribers mark sooner rather than later :)

**Thanks again!** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> France, Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Germany all have data retention laws in place, or are having them drawn up (again). Almost all European traffic gets funneled through Denmark or the UK, both of which are members of Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, or Fourteen Eyes. Denmark is particularly of interest, because it has a pipe to Russia.  
  
Out of all those you listed, only Iceland and maybe Panama are worth considering. </TEXT>

According to a recent KPMG survey of more than 2,000 people, 46% of adults in the UK said they would block ads because they do not like adverts at all. The report also found that more than 40% said adverts lacked relevance, while **34% said misuse of personal data was an issue**.  
  
Source: http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-awareness/adblocker-use-on-the-rise-finds-study/
  
Then there's the security issue with ad networks being compromised and serving up malicious ads. The motives behind using ad blockers can not be reduced to annoyance only.    
  
I want to pay for what I consume, but I run into several problems:  
  
- The publication runs on an ad-only or similar business model, with no room for actual payment with money by the reader  
- If it does provide a way for me to pay, it is usually for a subscription, and not per-article  
- Even if I do pay, they continue to track me, and sometimes continue to serve ads  
- There are no anonymous payment options, which is a problem for any online business, not just media
  
I've been using Blendle for a while now, paying per article as I go. But I decide against reading a fair amount of articles, because I don't want that in stored in the reading history that's connected to my 'real' identity. Even if I were to trust Blendle right now, I don't know what they will do with the data tomorrow. It is not uncommon for businesses that go bust to have the customer data auctioned off to the highest bidder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  To enjoy the beauty of the world per internet.

This is a possible use of Street View, but I don't believe it is Google's intended use. Google is a for-profit company. Creating or sharing beauty isn't their primary goal. Their primary goal is to make money from or off of us.  
  
I believe the primary goal of Street View is knowing our surroundings, how we interact with our surroundings, and knowing our travel patterns. With this knowledge they wish to improve their advertising business, by improving targeted advertising.  
  
Google is an advertising business. Every single product is built to benefit that business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I know, blurring out of privately-owned houses by personal request is only done in Germany, not Europe-wide. When someone moves into a house obscured in Street View at the request of the previous owner, they could put in a request to not obscure the house in the next update. Street View isn't static. Street View cars, cyclists and walkers roam our streets regularly.  
  
'Collateral blurring' that occurs in the process of blurring out faces and number plates is Google's responsibility, not 'Europe's'. It is Google's automated process that produces these flaws in their product, not EU or national regulations.  
  
I believe member states have already been very friendly toward Google's Street View product. Local and national governments share enormous amounts of data with Google; Land registry, traffic, etc. and of course the permission to catalog and digitize our public space, our property, and us. </TEXT>

You're grossly oversimplifying. A non-trivial amount of attackers so far were petty criminals, or unstable folk who converted to radical Islam shortly before their attacks.  
Their socio-economic situation, lack of proper healthcare, decades worth of poor integration policies, etc. are creating a fertile breeding ground for extremist sympathizers.  
  
A ban on e2e encrypted messaging will only stop law-abiding citizens from using them. Organizations such as IS can just write their own app, run their own servers or decentralized service, and can deploy its own encryption.  
Furthermore, encryption is necessary to protect the rights *and safety* of our citizens. Any ban or mandated backdoor would be foolish. </TEXT>
