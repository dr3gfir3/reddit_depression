I just....withdrew. Became passive aggressive. Stockpiled negativity, sharpened my eyeballs on them. Hid everything that I gave a shit about. Allowed for enough time to pass under these conditions, 2 out of 3 left me eventually. I didn't trust them enough by then to manage their perceptions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speaking from my own experience, the workload of homecare for my ailing grandmother, at one point my overwhelm was so great I experienced being angry with her. I didn't act on it, but where in life do you go for help and advice when overwhelmed? The ones who raised you.  When its them you need help with, well....it  sounds as though you made  a good decision for  everyone involved.  Its not fair to the elder when they are more than you can handle.  Best wishes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I flipped out pretty bad once, being tailgated on  a deserted two lane highway at night.  I think it was an actual predator situation, because there was absolutely no reason to ride me the way he was.  I was in a Ford Fusion, he a huge truck. After so many minutes I at first wanted to slam on my brakes and put his headlights (which were blinding me in all of my rear view mirrors) in my back seat.  I chose to whip my car off onto the shoulder and screeched to a stop.  He pulled over with me and stopped, too.  So, in my rage, I wasn't thinking too straight...I jumped out of the car,and screamed at him how he'd better be a cop, real fuckin' fast.  I walked towards the truck, into the headlights...and he decided he didn't want this after all.  Thank God.  If it had been the bad guy from Wolf Creek movies, I'da been screwed. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I apologize if this subject has already been batted around...I'm new-ish on Reddit.  Look at what evidence there is available as an m.o. would suggest:
both scenes suggested the murderer stayed a bit both before and after commiting the homicides (attic), all were hit in the head with an axe procured at the scene; both have non-family members present (2 each)(bad timing and luck for them), I haven't been able to establish any mention of oil lamp wicks being bent or mirrors being covered, the German reports (translations) bear no mention.  Any ideas?

Meet me at 3pm at git-n-go.
Then at 3pm, call him and say, sorry, meet me at quiktrip at 315pm.  Cops will have been devoting man hours to setting up a/v equipment to record the event, and they will be very angry and not want to switch locations at the last second.

	<TEXT> how long have you been using the speed?  The longer you've been on it, the harder it will be.  
General consensus I've taken over the last quarter of a century, 2 years pass by while you couch sit and moan in dull agony.  The fog finally lifts at around the two year mark; even then, one must make himself get up and be involved in life.  But, it can be done.  It doesn't sound as if you've been on it for long enough for this to apply to you.  
I've also learned when you're done, you're done.  Emotionally, physically, if you are truly over it, there won't be a bad struggle.  I was addicted and struggled with a vicodin addiction for 16 years solid; when I quit, I 
just...quit.  Everything fell into place and it wasn't an uphill battle at all.  This is not a normal experience, but I've been able twice in my life to quit two different drugs like that. You have to be truly ready, though. </TEXT>
