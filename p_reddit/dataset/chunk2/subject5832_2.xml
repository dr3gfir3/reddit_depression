	<TEXT> I love how people were like EnvyUS is gonna roll LG. Then the 5% dream happens. And we underdog betters get paid. Don't ever think that every match is guaranteed. It was a 95/5% game. Yes Tyloo should win, but don't ever think that any match is a fersure win with your betting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, and i've won with max bets on Tyloo for every game. But i get those gut feelings sometimes that their streak will end soon. I know they can only lose to KKTV and Skyred "ex. secret"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What a stupid post. You will always get less when it goes to your paypal. Be glad opskins even cashes your skins out and you don't get charged back from selling your skins to random people. </TEXT>
