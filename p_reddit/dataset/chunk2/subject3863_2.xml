	<TITLE> Questions about purchasing Underwood # 5 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-05 05:03:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know nothing about typewrites, basically I'm purchasing present and I found this [Underwood#5](http://newjersey.craigslist.org/atq/4837938421.html). To me it looks really rough but they do say it works. I would like to go and see it, so basically I would like to know what should I look out for. Also how much is this machine worth? I saw them selling anywhere from $50 to $250 so I don't want to over pay. For what is worth I looked up the serial number and it looks like this machine is form 1907. 

Finally should I attempt to clean it up? I don't want to do full restoration, just to clean up the rust and dirt. Will that affect the value of this typewriter? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Advice needed for upcoming Wedding Show/Cancer Benefit Giveaway </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-20 23:16:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We are looking in to sponsoring local breast cancer benefit. One of the requirements as sponsor is to provide a gift of minimum $100.00 that will be awarded to one of the brides at the end of the show. Problem is that we can't donate our services or discounts so, since we are wedding photography and videography studio free engagement session or wedding album are out of the question. Also organizers don't like gift cards. Preferably I would like to get something that lucky bride would actually like! 

So here is the question. What do we get for unknown lucky bride starting at about $100.00?  </TEXT>

I would like to purchase few books for my niece. I tried Amazon but, all she got was an email telling her that books are not available for that region. They did give her a credit to download something else that she likes.

I don't have much experience with purchasing online books so I was wondering if I could get a suggestion where could I purchase and download " Night School Fracture and Resistance "

	<TEXT> First I would like to apologize if I'm braking any rules by posting something business related. We are small wedding photography studio and I'm working on the text for promotional brochure that we will be using at upcoming show. I have no experience in writing advertising material and English is my second language. I would love to know if what I wrote is acceptable and of course any suggestions and revisions are appreciated. There is 5 separate parts and it's about 1300 words in total.

	<TEXT> I'm new to video editing and this sub so if I'm braking any rules sorry. 

Now here is what I have a problem with. I use FCP X and I'm trying to convert AVI ( recorded in 2010 ) to MOV. For this I used quick time that comes with mac. I have two large files about 42gb each and when I do conversion I only get sound on first 9min and 28sec on each file. 

 I was wondering if anyone can recommend good all-around software that I can use for this or any other conversion that I may need in future. I don't mind paying for it since I will be using it often. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  My sister and nice are spending vacation with me in USA and this morning I was talking to my sister about education, science, etc ... out of nowhere my 13 year old nice announces that she knows who made people! 

 For a moment I was mortified that I will have to try to explain evolution in few short minutes and make it interesting and convincing enough for 13 year old girl to understand. So while I was bracing for Adam and Eve story she started talking about earth cooling and water and amebas. For a moment I was proudest uncle in the world :)

 Some people may say " so what she learned that in school " and that maybe true, however she is coming form what we consider a 3rd world country that is heavily influenced by corrupt politicians and church with false morals. Fact that kids there are actually learning and accepting science instead of creationism and other nonsense is fantastic.

	<TITLE> Advice needed on wedding photography advertising by giving away e-session </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-09 03:22:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here is the question. My partner and I started wedding photography studio in NY/NJ area few month ago. We are both experienced wedding photographers but our studio is new and we wanted to speed up the process by offering free engagement session on weddingwire.com in order to generate some interest and some business. The way we wanted to do it is to have people sign up for a month and than pick one couple. 
Is this good marketing idea? Did you or someone you know offered this type of service and did it attract people in you price range or barging hunters only? Any info is appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: Since there were some questions about our portfolio here is our website so you guys can see for your self: www.visualmastersstudio.com

Prices that we offer are competitive in my opinion. We are not shooting for a top tear market but yet, but we don't want the bottom feeders ether. Middle-class fresh young professionals are what we are going for.
