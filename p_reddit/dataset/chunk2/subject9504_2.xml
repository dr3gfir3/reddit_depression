	<TEXT> A bail-bondsman can do pretty much whatever he wants when looking for a fugitive.  My guess is that he advised the sheriffs office that he was coming to town and asked them to keep the peace while he was searching the house for his fugitive.

	<TEXT> two dollars?  I never tip less than $5 when I dine in.  Its five bucks.  A two dollar tip almost seems like an insult to someone trying to make a living (to me at least).  

Also, there seem to be a lot of misconceptions among non-believers when it comes to what believers think and do.  You cant throw all believers into one basket and call them all the same, because they most certainly are not.  Maybe non-believers are all the same, I dont know, but believers range from robots who cant think for themselves to extremists (which is its own category with many levels) to just regular people who mind their business to everything in between.

Most believers who I know fall into the 'regular people who mind their business' category.  I feel like I speak for this 'group' when I say that we are disgusted and embarrassed by the extremists and hypocrites, the Jerry Falwells, the better-than-you's, the faith-healers and snake handlers, etc.  

Most churches arent like that.  I attend church regularly and I do not personally know anyone with the audacity to pass off a piece of paper with bible scripture on it as a tip.  These people are idiots and do not accurately represent the rest of us (believers).

	<TEXT> This is my understanding and someone correct me if I am wrong.

The constitution protects us from unreasonable searches from law enforcement officers, but not necessarily private parties.  When you walk into a Walmart (or any private property), you are agreeing to abide by whatever ridiculous rules they want to make up.  Its PRIVATE PROPERTY and they can make up the rules in their house.  So can you in your house.  You cant just do whatever you want and then scream 'I HAVE RIGHTS.'  You do not have to shop at Walmart if you dont like their rules.  But if you enter their house, its probably a good idea to act appropriately.  If you dont like it, dont be there.  You came to them; they did not bring their rules to you.

Also, where are these rights that he referred to?: "my **right not to submit to a search by a private party** was respected, and Walmart's **right to detain suspected shoplifters for a reasonable amount of time** while awaiting a law enforcement officer for an investigation was also respected" </TEXT>

I saw this in the Christiansburg, VA Walmart parking lot.  At first glance I thought it was an actual Virginia State Police car parked in the handicap parking.  Turns out it WAS a VSP car, taken out of service and auctioned off.  The new owner added the bumper guard and antennas so it still looks REAL....the license plate sort of blows his cover... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did.  The letter I received from the insurance company was in response to my doctors letter.  Its a well-known fact that insurance companies are crooks.  They are.  Its a fact.  I have done everything within my power to encourage them to pay for the medicine.  I have followed every procedure.  There is nothing else I can do, except for pay out-of-pocket.

On a related note, my mother pays for her own health insurance.  She has no major health problems, but pays $800 per month for coverage that doesnt cover anything!  She has a high copay, and still the insurance only covers a small percentage of office visits and medicine.  She is constantly receiving bills from doctors and labs for the balance that the insurance didnt pay.  They blatantly rip her (and millions like her) off every month and then laugh about it and post record profits.  It is my wish to see anyone and everyone associated with the health insurance business to be out of a fucking job.  I know that sounds harsh and unrealistic, but they have done nothing besides screw me and my family.

Additionally, doctors and other health care providers have to fight for every penny they receive from insurance companies.  I have had more than one doctor tell me that its such a hassle, that they almost dont even want to fuck with it.  They submit claims and are routinely denied.   So they have to submit them a second time.  Then, finally, after months and months, they see a little money.  

If you think insurance companies are anything but crooks, then you must live in a cave.  The proof is right there, everyday.  Its impossible to NOT know this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> its through my employer...I dont really have a choice... I have friends who pay for their own and they pay anywhere from $600 per month to just over $1000, which I find totally ridiculous, especially considering the high copay and high rate of denial to pay for even little things.

Oh, and they're all fucking crooks, so capitalism doesnt really apply.  I can get ass-raped by one or switch to another and get throat-fucked.  Thanks anyway.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Geek Squad is a fucking joke.  They always have been.  They exist solely to prey on ignorant computer owners.  The last time I shopped at BB, I was eavesdropping on the Geek Squad kiosk area as one of their village idiots informed an elderly woman that her grandsons laptop would cost over $100 to repair.  As soon as she left the store, I informed her that I would fix the machine FOR FREE at my shop if she would retrieve it from Best Buy.  She showed up at my store the next day and I fixed his machine in minutes using the recovery partition.  True story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...just received a letter from my insurance company a few days ago informing me that a prescription given to me by my doctor IS NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY.  What the fuck.  Maybe I'll just eat some M Ms and see if my symptoms  go away.  Fucking doucheholes at Anthem.  So I have decided to cost them as much money possible as often as possible.  No shit.  And dont tell me thats why your premiums are so high.  Your premiums are high because they are a bunch of crooks.  Literally.  They are liars, thieves, cheats...everything that I was brought up NOT to be, they are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like no harm was done to me.  Give her the tools to think for herself.  She took the book and brought it home.  Most children dont really have a grasp of the whys of atheism/theism, but that isnt the real issue.  Discuss it.  Tell her why its wrong, not because you are an atheist, but because there are special laws that keep the government from influencing religious beliefs.  You might even suggest that she respectfully return the book.  Good luck.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a fucking shame that most people dont realize who really runs the country.  Obama has to do something, and now that he has realized that he cant do what he wanted, he cant just give up.  It has to look like he is doing something.  So we are going to end up with some half-assed, hollow excuse for what could have been while the insurance companies continue to bathe in tubs of hundred-dollar-bills.

	<TEXT> I dont understand why this is seen by atheists as some sort of victory.  These types of Christians are going to do whatever it is that they're going to do.  None of it requires a counter move.  In fact, responding to it almost legitimizes it.  We already know what they're going to do.  It seems juvenile to me and I feel like it gives atheists a juvenile association.
