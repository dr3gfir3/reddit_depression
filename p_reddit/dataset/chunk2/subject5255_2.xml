I'd freaking love to see a Fight Club tv series!

I thought about it since everyone are developing series based off of movies I imagined one of my fav movies and I mixed two and two, I think it's genius...

It could go 3 Ways.

It could be like:


Fargo - It could be a freaking masterpiece

Limitless - Might not be a masterpiece but fun as hell

Minority Report - Kill me now...


I'd love to hear some reactions....

Anyway let me know if someone are considering of making it or atleast thought about it... </TEXT>

Obviously you guys would want more and more, but its better to leave us wanting more than for us to beg for them to get off the stage.

Fargo has been going great so far and I'd like to see it stay that way. 
A couple of dull season could ruin it's reputation..

Just your opinions?? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I remember watching an old classic film, that involves soldiers so it must be a war film...

I can't remember if it was about WW2 or the vietnam war...

It seems like a movie from the 40s or 50s..


The only scene I remember was a scene where everyone was receiving letter but the main guy didn't get any letters..

That's probably the most I can remember cuz I've seen it like 10 years ago and didn't finish it...

If someone can figure out this movie with this vague information that would be a miracle but hey it's worth a shot </TEXT>
