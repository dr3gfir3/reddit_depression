	<TEXT> To be honest, trying to fight through the block probably won't change much in this scenario If you've only gotten through one or two chapters in that time. Maybe carry on as you are, put it down properly for a while and come back when your interest piques again. 

I found Near and Mello too hard to take in straight after L. Especially Near, at first he seems like a wannabe L but they're quite different in a number of ways by the end.

The best thing about the manga is that despite the buttload of story to process, the series overall doesn't take long to finish. Was about 4 days for me. And personally it was completely worth it just to get to that glorious ending. The anime ending was good but the mangas is so much better IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand why people say the first arc is better, it takes its time setting itself up as watertight as it can for half the series, then all of a sudden it seems, its completely different. 

I watched the anime first and it seemed like it only JUST managed to fit the colossal amount of information that emerges in arc two; The cast gets drastically bigger very quickly, more minor characters that I'd not deemed too significant in arc one became more so, and all the while I was still wrapping my head around L. 

Even if you finish the series still uninvested in arc two I highly recommend a rewatch, or ideally, the manga. From my own experience  it was a necessity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a firm believer of Mastudas theory from the manga epilogue. Mikami was far too meticulous in checking the notebooks authenticity for him not to have been influenced by Near via DN IMO. Plus his mysterious "10 days later" death in prison, and the "burning" of the remaining Death Notes without anyone else present.

Honestly I watched the anime first, where the ending mainly makes you think "DAMN Near got lucky". It doesn't delve into the potential precautions I feel Near would've taken to secure his victory. L was willing to sacrifice a couple of people to catch Kira iirc, so why wouldn't Near do so with Mikami? The manga gave you a lot more to think about post Kira for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see :) It's nice to know the people and their difficulties are represented fairly.

I guess I shouldn't be so surprised, I've been questioning the moral integrity of almost everyone I work with for the past two or so years. A lot of the opinions and ideologies they have send shivers down my spine. Thank you, I'm very glad I got a second opinion :D </TEXT>
