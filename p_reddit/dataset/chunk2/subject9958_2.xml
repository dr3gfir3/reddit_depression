	<TEXT> This would be amazing. And who ever wins the duel stays in against the next but his damage carries over. Instead of refreshing 1v1s I feel like that'll lead to more clutch/epic moments. This is a great idea. Upvote so hopefully Ubisoft adds it in one day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree. It's unfortunate, in my case, to have pretty much cycled through all variants of my conquerer helmets by the time I hit rep 3 that when I geared out I didn't get that "bad ass" vibe because I looked so similar to how I did when I was just turning rep 2. It does add minor details but I wish there was a more unique style to them. All I can say is maybe when * pieces release for the other armor pieces they will be highly unique. Just kinda wish that was the case currently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just wondering what you guys are running and what works for you and why? I'm currently running throw since I figure I can block my way into revenge and therefore take advantage of the throw. At 108 GS is maxed throw that big of a different to warrant the loss of revenge by injury? I don't have two sets of gear to test so not sure if this is best or if I should keep looking.

	<TEXT> This is true. But a PK light attack barrage is just insane though. Lol I literally block left and hope one of the first 3 strikes hits left so I can block. I don't bother changing guard since they come out too quick and I cannot react fast enough to block all of them lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You not living will NEVER be better for anyone. Never think or say that. We all go through tough times because we all go through good times. If you have never experienced happiness then you wouldn't know you were sad because you'd have nothing to compare it too. And without a bit if sadness we wouldn't appreciate the good.

I started college when I was 18, by 21 I dropped out. Years passed where I thought I was a failure while watching friends go on to bigger and better things. I eventually went back and graduated, 6 years later at the age of 27 with a degree most people I knew had by the time they were 22. 

But I did it, and I'm happy now. It wasn't in my area of original focus, I changed majors many times, but found something I truly enjoy. It took me years to really self reflect and mature as an individual before I was able to tackle school again. In that meantime I worked dead end jobs and had no degree. But now things have changed.

You do not know where you will be in 1, 2, 5, 6 years. Life always has ups and downs. You will always have downs. But you will also have ups. Taking your life is never the answer. Just consider what you are facing and compare it to someone else. Look at Stephen Hawkings condition and he continues carrying on. Your situation can always be much worse and there are always people in much worse situations maintaining a positive mindset. 

Just being alive and being able to see a sunny day or rainy night, feel the wind, eat, sleep, laugh, think, be bored. Anything is better than nothing. And becoming nothing by taking your life will only being pain and suffering to those you love.

Keep on pushing forward. Life might seem bad now but it won't always be. Take it from someone who earned a 4 year degree in 10 years. I can relate. The feeling if disappointing people sucks. But that's that all there is to life. Learn to ignore it and move at your OWN pace. Your pace may be similar to mine which is a bit slower than average, but that isn't bad, just different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a conqueror here and PK never really give me a tough time. Being slow you need to be the one who plays on reaction. I camp side guards at mid range to bait the over head lunge, block, GB side heavy and try for a shield bash to test their skill and see if they dodge or just get pummeled. Smarter PKs won't go for that but I throw it out there. When I'm rushed I just pick a side and block it. It becomes a guessing game with how fast her LA are so I just pick a side and hope it's the first, second, or third strike they throw, at which point you can parry, GB and repeat. I like to charge my heavy periodically at a distance just to keep the at bay and then dash to a side to cancel out of it. Believe it or not going into your infinite to cover distance and throwing out a heavy when somewhat in range lands occasionally and can catch people of guard. I use this to start funneling them in the direction I want, bottom line you want to force her against a wall so that your shield bash heavy combo because inescapable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I prefer minimum duration because I rather go into revenge more often rather than stay in each interval of revenge longer. The best part of gaining revenge is making the opponents timid since they can get knocked down. That alone gives you momentum. And once you use revenge and fight them off you can more quickly get out of that state and threaten with another revenge immediately after your quick super Saiyan outburst.

Just my opinion though and how I like to play.

I'm a conqueror if that helps. </TEXT>
