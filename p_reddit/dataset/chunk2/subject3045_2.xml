	<TEXT>  Any gay panic caused by scenes from movies that aren't even out. See ParaNorman, Finding Dory, and Beauty and the Beast. I never saw ParaNorman...

Here's the gay scene from ParaNorman, in case you're curious.

	<TITLE> Movies where you can't see the past the actor or voice actor? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Whether it's an animated movie or live action film, what are some movies where you just can't see past the actor or voice actor? In other words, the person's voice is so distinct or maybe you're so familiar with the actor, you don't see them as the character they're playing? For example, in the most recent Jungle Book movie, everytime Kaa opened its mouth, all I heard was Scarlett Johansson trying to voice a snake. Her voice was just too distinct. </TEXT>
