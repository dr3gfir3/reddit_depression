	<TEXT> Well  that's not really all it is. If you click on each link it offers a pull out that summarizes the article, and attempts to explain the concept in a concise and cohesive manner. Of course an aggregation of other relevant links would be totally awesome, and it's something I'd love to do, but like you said the biggest limitation is time.

If you're interested in getting involved, I'm always looking for help :) </TEXT>

I'm not opposed to the attempt, but I think it's important to value it for what it is actually doing: raising awareness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but I think it's important to consider this line from the article:

While our algorithm produces a superior result on this particular dataset, this does not indicate that machine vision outperforms human vision on object recognition in general, they wrote. On recognizing elementary object categories (i.e., common objects or concepts in daily lives) such as the Pascal VOC task, machines still have obvious errors in cases that are trivial for humans." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fascinating report, horrible title for the article. Here are the points of interest:


aklokus [10:13 AM]10:13
The Boston Consulting Group predicts that investment in industrial robots will grow 10 percent a year in the world's 25-biggest export nations through 2025, up from 2 percent to 3 percent a year now. The investment will pay off in lower costs and increased efficiency.

Robots will cut labor costs by 33 percent in South Korea, 25 percent in Japan, 18 percent in China, 24 percent in Canada and 22 percent in the United States and Taiwan. Only 10 percent of jobs that can be automated have already been taken by robots. By 2025, the machines will have more than 23 percent, Boston Consulting forecasts.

Increasing automation is likely to change the way companies evaluate where to open and expand factories. Boston Consulting expects that manufacturers will "no longer simply chase cheap labor." Factories will employ fewer people, and those that remain are more likely to be highly skilled. That could lure more manufacturers back to the United States from lower-wage emerging market countries. </TEXT>
