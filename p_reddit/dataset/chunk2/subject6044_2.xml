	<TITLE> Question about Business Structure of SEO providers. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-02 10:36:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey, I am a longtime web dev and until now have done a certain amount of SEO for clients - not as a package but as a matter of course when I build a site. Basically giving clients fully optimised sites. content provision/copywriting, setting up Google Analytics etc and various other SEO aspects all within the dev project by default.

I'm now moving more to being a freelance consultant  than a strict web dev and have been looking at stand-alone modular services I can provide - SEO being a main one of them.

My question then is not about the mechanics/techniques of SEO but rather whether someone can point to some resource (or give advice) on the structure of the business angle: to charge by the hour, or by the site, to offer packages, price levels maybe... 

What is the way the business is best structured? I have no idea... thanks

	<TEXT> Mac 10.11.6 - 1Tb iMac of which 300g is used. Have a Lacie 500g hard drive I usually use for TM backups. 

From time to time I reformat it and start over as I don't need extensive back up and I did this today. For the first time though I am getting an error which says "Time Machine failed to back up - not enough space on disk".

Basically it's trying to back up the whole 1tb (it says this in the error and also in the TM preferences) despite the fact only 300g of the 1tb is used **AND** I have disallowed large amounts of music, vids and the Applications folder. 

Anyone any ideas?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a long-term freelance web-dev (since 1999) and now I'm getting older pretty much tired of being chained to a screen indoors and also notice I am getting slower and have less energy. Time for some changes. 

I need to take a new direction - preferably based on my existing skillset (coding, SEO, Copywriting, Sales, writing in general and coaching/advice) - but one that would shift me into more of a consultancy 'people' role.

Any suggestions? What areas would you look at in my situation? 

Many thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question re TV series purchase poss error on iTunes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-18 14:39:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I bought a couple of episodes of "People vs OJ Simpson" on UK iTunes Store to see if I liked it. 

The whole series was 14.99 GBP and each of the 10 episodes 1.89 GBP, thought if I wanted to buy the series the ones I'd previously bought would be deducted. 

Usually this happens - you buy one episode and get a prompt 'Complete the series for xxx' with xxx being the adjusted price. This does not happen with this series on my ATV where with all other series it does. However many I've bought it always says the original price of the series 14.99. 

So basically I have to buy all 10 episodes individually at 1.89 each now or bite it and buy for 14.99. Either way it's costing way more than 14.99 as I bought 4 episodes thinking the series price would take account of this.

Is it an error? What can be done? Anything? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-04-25 11:41:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We've made a splash page that is straight html and is sitting in root as index.html.

We can make this page the default root landing page by giving .html preference over .php in .htaccess and this works fine but the splash page contains a link to the previous homepage at index.php and when this is clicked the link reverts to the splash page because .html is taking preference.

What's the best way to deal with this - i.e:

1) have the splash page sit in root (i.e. not in WP) and replaces the old WP default landing page

2) have a link in this splash page which then links to the old default landing page in WP.

Cheers! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Been using Overplay.net in Spain for a couple of years since the BBC satellite footprint was reduced - been working fine but now there are huge issues with it on Netflix on Apple TV 2. 

Basically it allows some streaming of certain shows but not others - they get an authorisation error. This is with Overplay DNS set to US. Setting it to UK doesn't seem to work at all. 

That's the first issue. 

Second issue is Overplay seem to be no longer responding to any support requests. Many people have this issue - I've sent at least 20 mails and I know people who've been trying for months. Actually they're still taking people's money, which is fraud right? But that's another story.

So two issue I'd appreciate any help with:

1) Any help with fixing the Netflix/ATV2 issue

2) Suggestions for alternative to Overplay to stream Netflix to ATV2 and also get BBC/ITV players via Airplay on Apple devices. 

Much appreciated, thanks. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-03-12 21:01:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I need a little help/advice with something. Basically I need to have a Splash page in root - index.html - which links to deeper pages, one of which is index.php (the main Wordpress install) also in root. So essentially having index.html and index.php in root and the WP remaining untouched there but the Splashpage becoming the homepage and linking to the WP start page. Reason for this is to have choice of languages/other custom options.

I have the Splash page there in root and have put this:

DirectoryIndex index.html

in .htaccess which DOES make the Splash page the homepage but when I click on the link on the Splash - www.mysiteexample.com/index.php - it redirects again to the Splashpage. 

Ive installed a plugin Disable Canonical URL Redirection by Mark Jaquith but it seems to have no effect.

Is there anything we can do to get the .html and .php pages in root both working so that splash page loads as default and when links on it are clicked they go on to the main WP first page? </TEXT>

www.notrealdomain1.com/site1
www.notrealdomain1.com/site2

So we can then edit www.notrealdomain1.com/site2 and change the content - while the original domain - www.notrealdomain1.com - becomes a splash page with links to both the subdomains. 

Can anyone point me in the direction of how best and easiest to do this? Thanks!

	<TEXT> I listed a rare and expensive book on ebay for five days with a BIN and accepting offers. Towards the end of the auction I get someone puts in an offer, one of several I got, and which was the current highest. Feedback seems good, member for years. All ok.

So I wait a little to see if there are any higher offers and in this time he changes his mind and asks to withdraw the offer because he can't afford it and can I reject it. I say that I'll wait a day and if I get another offer I'll take it. If not I'll make a counteroffer and we'll take it from there. He says thanks.

10 minutes later someone buys it. No offer or questions/contact - just a straight away purchase and immediate payment. This person has an account a few months old and only 1 feedback. 

So I go to check and their address is incomplete so I can't ship. I've mailed them for the correct address but no reply yet.

So, my question is: is this suspicious? If so how and what could it be? Or is it Kosher and nothing to worry about? If I don't hear back from them re the address - meaning I can't ship it - what's the best course of action?

As a foundation I'm currently knowing pretty much zero - so would be grateful for any tips on where to start... preferably books... spend too much time in front of a screen anyway!

Are there any accepted 'Bibles' to get up to speed? I've found this list in this sub from one year ago:

	<TEXT> Most of my custom coding work has been in ExpressionEngine, Craft and Statamic etc but now I am looking to move into Squarespace as I will probably need to make a site in it quite quickly.

Are there any resources anyone can point to for good tutorials/guides to get up to speed in the shortest time...or maybe a good book?

I'd also like some input on themes and how they work - do the ones that Squarespace provide always form the basis? Or are there third-party themes? Can you code your own from scratch and drop it in like you can with ExpressionEngine?

Thanks and apologies for the undoubtedly silly and basic questions! Just getting up to speed! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mostly work in ExpressionEngine or other CMS like Craft and code in html5/css3 etc. Basically I need to get a website/portfolio up asap but I'm not up for designing one (design skills zero) and it needs to only be a light minimalist quasi-cv anyway.

My question is re which route to go. I'm considering maybe WordPress with a basic theme or else a hosted solution like About.me with my custom domain.... kind of leaning towards this last one.

Is going with about.me a bad idea in terms of generating leads/enquiries? Are there any similar solutions aimed maybe more at creatives? 

What about Pixpa or Squarespace? A better bet? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Kind of a weird question but I'm living in Spain and the time is coming to move on (I'm originally from the UK but been living abroad 20 years) - I'm getting older and don't really feel up for relocating somewhere I don't know so thinking about (horrifically) moving back.... it's not just me I'm considering the needs of my partner and daughter here. 

So.... if this were to happen, where is a good place from an esoteric pov (please no-one suggest Brighton). I'm seriously considering Glastonbury... I know there's millions of flakes and weirdos there which would be uber-annoying but on the plus-side I could make a business where they are a key target which is good and also the place itself has a vibe I think I might need right now, it's definitely magical despite the depredations of many of the populace.

Anyone have any alternate suggestions? Reasons why Glastonbury is a must or must-not? I can work anywhere pretty much so this is about quality of life and esoteric-sensibility in the environment. I'm also pretty out there myself so would help to be somewhere where I am not the weirdest person in the room at any given place. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I'm an ExpressionEngine dev and am possibly being tasked with creating a design for the Umbraco CMS which I am not familiar with.

Actually the design is pretty much ready, I just need to slot it in to the CMS - that's how it works with EE anyway as it is essentially a blank slate where content is completely separate from design.

For anyone unfamiliar you basically code up your pages and insert EE tags which are pretty much like Php tags. More to it than that but you get the drift.

Is Umbraco a similar set-up? I know it's not Php but is it going to be doable coding the design in html and just slotting it in this way? I heard it was a steep learning curve. 

How difficult is this going to be or should I try to sway them to another CMS I am familiar with? </TEXT>

Any advice appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Macbook Air - 3 months old. It was shut down ok but now when trying to login the username and password fields remain blank when typing in. After hitting a few keys it acts like one key is stuck (it isn't) and random characters get input into the field until it reaches the field limit. This after touching a key, any key, once. 

The result is that obviously it is impossible to login. I have checked with an external keyboard and the same behaviour is present. Any ideas as to what could be causing this? Not really possible to troubleshoot or fix it if login is impossible.

	<TEXT> Can anyone recommend a book for a friend of mine... what they want is essentially a course which is tantamount to an initiation.. sort of Step1, Step2 etc I guess.... I'm thinking a book that walks you through various exercises much like Chapman's "Magick for Beginners".

The only stipulation I think is that it must not be Chaos Magick (or else I could come up with a few!) - does anyone have any suggestions?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're looking for a smallish space - not co-working - which would be for a couple of designers and also be capable of being transformed into an art exhibition space if needed. 

Anyone know of anywhere or have any tips on how to go about finding? Cheers! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm selling a large amount of books - probably over 2000 in all - and am currently listing them in a spreadsheet which is taking me some time because of other stuff. I'll post it here when ready. 

Meanwhile if interested you can do one of two things - PM me or post here and I'll let you know when I have it or ask for specific titles/authors and I can tell you what I have.

Mostly they new or lightly used pb/hb on the following subjects:

* Modern fiction (Murakami, McEwan, Ishiguro etc)
* Crime fiction
* True crime
* Magick/occult/paranormal
* Religion/theology esp Islamic/Sufism
* Paranormal/conspiracy
* Counterculture/drugs etc

I also have collectable first editions but that's another story and will sell those separately. 

Edit: added Imgur links below to photos of some of the books. There's a lot more than this but if you see anything you're interested in from the photos shoot me a PM or post below.

	<TITLE> Achieving Gnosis and/or trance states through stroboscopic light </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-05 21:26:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Has anyone experimented with this? I was first interested in the Burroughs/Gysin Dream Machine - there's a video on YouTube called 'Flicker' for those who haven't heard of it (has Kenneth Anger in it) - but recently acquired a more sophisticated computer-driven device for producing hypnagogic states.

I'm still experimenting but so far it seems to induce states similar to deep meditation with a very defined DMT-like effect. Have not tried any Sigilisation or other workings yet but it occurs to me it could be a powerful methodology. 

Anyone else ever worked on similar lines? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For various reasons which shall remain obscure I am not a big fan of the 'traditional' charging method and am experimenting with other ideas - Chinese lantern with sigil on planned shortly. 

Would like to get into a mantra-based one - anyone found any effective methods they can recommend? 

How would you approach reaching Gnosis through chanting/mantras? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What forms of meditation do people find most helpful? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-29 09:04:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm just starting to get into it, had a resistant push-back against New-Ageyness for a while but I've started to see the benefits.

I've been starting with Mindfulness which seems to be some sort of Vipassana/Gurdjieffian mash-up but in some ways it seems a bit 'passive' - probably not the right word as I guess that's what meditation should be but there's something about it I can't quite nail down... maybe the McMeditation angle.

Anyone working with other forms? </TEXT>
