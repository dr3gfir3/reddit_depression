Do you use Infiniband? If so, what do you (dis)like about it?

Is it worth it?

I'm asking because it looks like it's worth it to me, but I want to hear your thoughts too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so I'm working on some storage design n stuff, and I have read mixed info about Windows mounting NFS exports. I've seen that having it in TCP mode (without UDP enabled) it performs very well.

But I was hoping I could get some real-world input.

Have you used NFS at all in Windows? Be it as a client or server (preferably as a client to a BSD/NIX box). If so, please tell me all about it :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm reading through info on CAT6A and such ( http://www.blackbox.com/resource/genPDF/White-Papers/CAT6A-FUTP-VS-UTP.pdf ) and it's saying that tight bundles for this class of cable can lead to ANEXT, so loosely running is advised (still reading).

This got me thinking about lower categories, like 5e/6. How often is ANEXT a problem with tight bundles of 5e/6?

This is of course talking about like long runs to drops for 1gige, not 10gige. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> LANified!, Memory Express and Calgary Expo teaming up for awesome video gaming features next week! (apr 16-19 2015, Calgary) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-11 09:12:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Hear me now fellow gamers!**

Today **LANified!**, **Memory Express** and the **Calgary Comic   Entertainment Expo** are proud to announce a joint effort to bring you awesome video gaming features at the coming **Calgary Comic   Entertainment Expo 2015**!

_You read that right_, the best parts of entertainment culture in Calgary have come together to provide interactive modern gaming experiences at the expo next week.

We will be offering two facets in this conjoined effort. Demonstration and Competition, both of which will be interactive!

Memory Express will have an incredible setup demonstrating the true value in current gaming equipment. You will be able to sample and indulge in the highest grade gaming experience currently offered. There will be multiple systems setup as well as incredibly knowledgeable staff readily available to help demystify the most common question: "Is the hardware really worth it?" Not only that but should you decide you want to make it happen they will be immediately ready to help you figure out your dream rig.

But wait, there's so much more. In addition to the Demonstration setups the joint effort really shines in the Competitive regard!

Immediately adjacent to Memory Express' setup is our interactive tournament area! LANified! will be running interactive tournaments throughout the entirety of the expo! Not only that, but the tournaments are open to **everyone** that makes it into the expo! There will be a different tournament on each of the first three days of the expo and we will be holding finals for all of the tournaments on the fourth day (Sunday). Each tournament will feature prizing at different stages of the tournament and we (LANified!) have specially designed the tournaments to be welcoming to gamers of all skill levels! Furthermore special care has gone into the tournament formats so that you can have an exciting experience without having to over-commit your time.

**_The first stage_** of each tournament will be a King of the Hill format, where we take ready gamers and throw them into the next game! Gamers will be competing for control of the hill and as you continue to win you stay in to face more challengers! Should you reach certain consecutive wins you will earn prizes and even be invited to the second stage on Sunday to enter the exciting finals!

**_The second stage_** of each tournament will take the fiercest gamers from the first stages and pit them against each other to determine who really is the best, battling for a 1st place prize!

The tournament area consists of a raised podium, bleachers and registration/administration. Those who enter the tournaments will be playing on extremely high grade gaming systems provided by Memory Express; enabling you to have the fairest chance in the tournaments and a highly immersive experience! The games will be projected live onto a massive screen on the stage for all to see. Each computer station will be additionally equipped with the finest peripherals: mechanical keyboards, precision mice and high-grade headsets. Additionally the computer stations will come pre-loaded with the games and for the team tournaments pre-connected to an on-site mumble voice server, providing the highest grade voice communications enabling you to co-ordinate with your team effortlessly.

Have you ever seen a gaming competition and thought to yourself, **why not me?** **Why can't I enter that?** How exciting and awesome would that be? **That's what LANified! is all about** and what we're doing here is bringing that incredible experience to you! We _**want**_ you to enter, we _**want**_ you to give it your best and we certainly _**want**_ you to have a blast. Gaming is so much fun and live competitive gaming brings you an experience you simply can't find online. What are you waiting for? **Step up and fight for the hill!**

**_But subject5587, what games are in the tournaments?_**

 * Thursday - Trackmania2 Stadium

 * Friday - Team Fortress 2

 * Saturday - League of Legends

**_But subject5587, how do I enter? Does this cost me anything? Where is this located?_**

If you are already at the expo it doesn't cost you anything extra! The tournaments are only available to those at the expo with a valid expo ticket for the day. However if you have been invited to finals on Sunday and you do not have an expo ticket for Sunday we will be arranging special considerations so that you can enter the tournament finals! This does not grant you access to the rest of the expo, this will be exclusive access to the finals as a finalist.

We will be taking tournament registration at the expo throughout the event. All of this is located in the Agrium Building, about a stone's throw away from check-in for the expo itself (same building). We recommend you enter the tournaments early as we have a limited number of spots for finalists, but if you want to enter later in the day don't let that stop you! Additionally we will generally be keeping a short queue for each match so that gamers don't have to wait long to get in. Just come to our registration/administration table and say "I want in!"

**_But subject5587, why are you choosing these games and formats?_**

We have selected these games and formats because they are fun, easy to pick up, and have a limited time commitment. We wanted to strike a balance between structured competition and accessibility to newcomers. Historically we have seen great success with these games, formats and styles, and we are confident this will deliver on an exciting experience with fair competition. Additionally these games are fantastic for spectating, we want to draw the spectators into the action too!

**_But subject5587, what are the finer details of the tournaments and prizing?_**

The complete details of the tournament formats and the prizing is not yet finalized, we are working to complete that as soon as possible. Some additional scheduling details is available at : http://calgaryexpo.com/gaming/ and we will be posting the rest of the details at a later date.

**_But subject5587, I've never entered a tournament before, am I welcome?_**

EVERYONE is welcome! If you're at the expo, step on up! We understand that not everyone will want to compete, and that there will be those who just want to spectate, but we make it so easy to enter and get involved you really have nothing to lose and so much to gain! Competitive gaming at all levels is a blast and we invite you to join us in the fun.


With so much going on it's understandable if you have more questions than we have answered here. We're ready to take your questions publicly or privately. If you want to contact us privately and directly you can email me (subject5587) at bloodyiron _at._ lanified .dot_. com (obfuscated so I don't get spammed, sorry). And if you want to know more about other events we have coming up (we have 2 LAN parties coming up) just head to http://www.lanified.com

Are you excited? We certainly are! </TEXT>

We wanted to strike a balance between structured competition and accessibility to newcomers. Historically we have seen great success with these games, formats and styles, and we are confident this will deliver on an exciting experience with fair competition. Additionally these games are fantastic for spectating, we want to draw the spectators into the action too!

**_But subject5587, what are the finer details of the tournaments and prizing?_**

The complete details of the tournament formats and the prizing is not yet finalized, we are working to complete that as soon as possible. Some additional scheduling details is available at : http://calgaryexpo.com/gaming/ and we will be posting the rest of the details at a later date.

**_But subject5587, I've never entered a tournament before, am I welcome?_**

EVERYONE is welcome! If you're at the expo, step on up! We understand that not everyone will want to compete, and that there will be those who just want to spectate, but we make it so easy to enter and get involved you really have nothing to lose and so much to gain! Competitive gaming at all levels is a blast and we invite you to join us in the fun.


With so much going on it's understandable if you have more questions than we have answered here. We're ready to take your questions publicly or privately. If you want to contact us privately and directly you can email me (subject5587) at bloodyiron _at._ lanified .dot_. com (obfuscated so I don't get spammed, sorry). And if you want to know more about other events we have coming up (we have 2 LAN parties coming up) just head to http://www.lanified.com

Are you excited? We certainly are! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Hear me now fellow gamers!**

Today **LANified!**, **Memory Express** and the **Calgary Comic   Entertainment Expo** are proud to announce a joint effort to bring you awesome video gaming features at the coming **Calgary Comic   Entertainment Expo 2015**!

_You read that right_, the best parts of entertainment culture in Calgary have come together to provide interactive modern gaming experiences at the expo next week.

We will be offering two facets in this conjoined effort. Demonstration and Competition, both of which will be interactive!

Memory Express will have an incredible setup demonstrating the true value in current gaming equipment. You will be able to sample and indulge in the highest grade gaming experience currently offered. There will be multiple systems setup as well as incredibly knowledgeable staff readily available to help demystify the most common question: "Is the hardware really worth it?" Not only that but should you decide you want to make it happen they will be immediately ready to help you figure out your dream rig.

But wait, there's so much more. In addition to the Demonstration setups the joint effort really shines in the Competitive regard!

Immediately adjacent to Memory Express' setup is our interactive tournament area! LANified! will be running interactive tournaments throughout the entirety of the expo! Not only that, but the tournaments are open to **everyone** that makes it into the expo! There will be a different tournament on each of the first three days of the expo and we will be holding finals for all of the tournaments on the fourth day (Sunday). Each tournament will feature prizing at different stages of the tournament and we (LANified!) have specially designed the tournaments to be welcoming to gamers of all skill levels! Furthermore special care has gone into the tournament formats so that you can have an exciting experience without having to over-commit your time.

**_The first stage_** of each tournament will be a King of the Hill format, where we take ready gamers and throw them into the next game! Gamers will be competing for control of the hill and as you continue to win you stay in to face more challengers! Should you reach certain consecutive wins you will earn prizes and even be invited to the second stage on Sunday to enter the exciting finals!

**_The second stage_** of each tournament will take the fiercest gamers from the first stages and pit them against each other to determine who really is the best, battling for a 1st place prize!

The tournament area consists of a raised podium, bleachers and registration/administration. Those who enter the tournaments will be playing on extremely high grade gaming systems provided by Memory Express; enabling you to have the fairest chance in the tournaments and a highly immersive experience! The games will be projected live onto a massive screen on the stage for all to see. Each computer station will be additionally equipped with the finest peripherals: mechanical keyboards, precision mice and high-grade headsets. Additionally the computer stations will come pre-loaded with the games and for the team tournaments pre-connected to an on-site mumble voice server, providing the highest grade voice communications enabling you to co-ordinate with your team effortlessly.

Have you ever seen a gaming competition and thought to yourself, **why not me?** **Why can't I enter that?** How exciting and awesome would that be? **That's what LANified! is all about** and what we're doing here is bringing that incredible experience to you! We _**want**_ you to enter, we _**want**_ you to give it your best and we certainly _**want**_ you to have a blast. Gaming is so much fun and live competitive gaming brings you an experience you simply can't find online. What are you waiting for? **Step up and fight for the hill!**

**_But subject5587, what games are in the tournaments?_**

 * Thursday - Trackmania2 Stadium

 * Friday - Team Fortress 2

 * Saturday - League of Legends

**_But subject5587, how do I enter? Does this cost me anything? Where is this located?_**

If you are already at the expo it doesn't cost you anything extra! The tournaments are only available to those at the expo with a valid expo ticket for the day. However if you have been invited to finals on Sunday and you do not have an expo ticket for Sunday we will be arranging special considerations so that you can enter the tournament finals! This does not grant you access to the rest of the expo, this will be exclusive access to the finals as a finalist.

We will be taking tournament registration at the expo throughout the event. All of this is located in the Agrium Building, about a stone's throw away from check-in for the expo itself (same building). We recommend you enter the tournaments early as we have a limited number of spots for finalists, but if you want to enter later in the day don't let that stop you! Additionally we will generally be keeping a short queue for each match so that gamers don't have to wait long to get in. Just come to our registration/administration table and say "I want in!"

**_But subject5587, why are you choosing these games and formats?_**

We have selected these games and formats because they are fun, easy to pick up, and have a limited time commitment. We wanted to strike a balance between structured competition and accessibility to newcomers. Historically we have seen great success with these games, formats and styles, and we are confident this will deliver on an exciting experience with fair competition.

However if you have been invited to finals on Sunday and you do not have an expo ticket for Sunday we will be arranging special considerations so that you can enter the tournament finals! This does not grant you access to the rest of the expo, this will be exclusive access to the finals as a finalist.

We will be taking tournament registration at the expo throughout the event. All of this is located in the Agrium Building, about a stone's throw away from check-in for the expo itself (same building). We recommend you enter the tournaments early as we have a limited number of spots for finalists, but if you want to enter later in the day don't let that stop you! Additionally we will generally be keeping a short queue for each match so that gamers don't have to wait long to get in. Just come to our registration/administration table and say "I want in!"

**_But subject5587, why are you choosing these games and formats?_**

We have selected these games and formats because they are fun, easy to pick up, and have a limited time commitment. We wanted to strike a balance between structured competition and accessibility to newcomers. Historically we have seen great success with these games, formats and styles, and we are confident this will deliver on an exciting experience with fair competition. Additionally these games are fantastic for spectating, we want to draw the spectators into the action too!

**_But subject5587, what are the finer details of the tournaments and prizing?_**

The complete details of the tournament formats and the prizing is not yet finalized, we are working to complete that as soon as possible. Some additional scheduling details is available at : http://calgaryexpo.com/gaming/ and we will be posting the rest of the details at a later date.

**_But subject5587, I've never entered a tournament before, am I welcome?_**

EVERYONE is welcome! If you're at the expo, step on up! We understand that not everyone will want to compete, and that there will be those who just want to spectate, but we make it so easy to enter and get involved you really have nothing to lose and so much to gain! Competitive gaming at all levels is a blast and we invite you to join us in the fun.


With so much going on it's understandable if you have more questions than we have answered here. We're ready to take your questions publicly or privately. If you want to contact us privately and directly you can email me (subject5587) at bloodyiron _at._ lanified .dot_. com (obfuscated so I don't get spammed, sorry). And if you want to know more about other events we have coming up (we have 2 LAN parties coming up) just head to http://www.lanified.com

Are you excited? We certainly are! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While the FDA is far from perfect, it does prevent vendors and crackpots from selling gimmicks that have, historically, actually harmed and lead to the deaths of people.

While I'm for a modern market, I am curious what can be done to prevent people who either accidentally or intentionally sell shitty products that due to their lower quality could lead to harming someone?

	<TEXT> As I think about linux on the corporate desktop I can't help but first think about the hurdles to overcome. But sometimes I think about some of the awesome things you can't do without Linux (or similar) on the desktop.

Consider a software development company, imagine almost all their workstations are Linux. Now imagine they could distribute code compiles among the majority of the company's workstations.

That seems like just the beginning... </TEXT>

Check this thread : http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/530062-changing-the-local-admin-passwords-across-the-network

The nice thing about doing it in the GPO is that it can apply without our intervention, so as systems come on and offline the changes will apply. But it seems now I have to manually babysit computers as they come on and offline.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi,

I'm subject5587. You may or may not have heard of me, but I run LANified!, but that's only part of the truth. The other part is that we have a team that **_helps_** me run LANified!, our events and services, and so much more. If you are unfamiliar with what we do I'll cover more of that lower in this post.

**But subject5587, so what?**

Well, we need more help. I want us to do more great things, but in order to do them we need to expand our team. We already have an awesome team, and I think that we should find more awesome people to join.

**But subject5587, what kind of help are we talking about?**

We are working on a super awesome project and we need a few more people to help us get off the ground so to say with it. We welcome everyone to apply for this, even if you have no experience; We would prefer that you apply instead of hesitate! Experience helps, but not everyone has it.

 **-Non-specific Broadcasting Position**

We are looking for 3 people to help us regularly with a project related to Broadcasting that we are working on. Should you be interested in Broadcasting please consider the following:

* Have you ever been involved with any live broadcasting before? Be it a broadcast simply of yourself, an activity you are performing, or a broadcast that involves multiple people and/or activities. If so, please tell us about it/them.
* What do you know about broadcasting?
* What about broadcasting interests you?
* Have you ever done any live or non-live video production? Non-live video production would involve post-recording production and/or distribution. If so, tell us about that.
* What is your schedule like? Where can you contribute from a schedule perspective?
* Do you have a vehicle? (NOT REQUIRED but helps)
* Have you ever been on camera before during a live broadcast? This would include any traditional/network broadcasting, say a news channel interview.
* Is there specific content you would want to be involved with? How flexible are you to content you haven't been involved with before?
* Have you ever operated a video camera?
* Do you have any experience with audio production?
* Have you ever given a speech, presented to an audience, or prepared a presentation?

**To apply please email me bloodyiron - atT - lanified -dotT- com and include as much information as you can. Again we WANT your help, so apply already! Additionally if you want to contribute in other areas than what I have listed here, do reach out to me.**

**But subject5587, do I get paid for this?**

This is strictly voluntary. We do not compensate  financially or in other specific ways. That being said, we provide valuable experience that can be put on your resume. Many of those that have helped us have leveraged the experienced gained to move their careers forward.

**But subject5587, who are you? What is LANified!? Why should I help? And why should I not down-vote this into oblivion?**

I am the founder of LANified!. We have been operating for 8 years. LANified! has primarily ran LAN parties throughout Calgary, but we have also ran other gaming related events and services. We run gaming servers, a public mumble server, tournaments, and have also provided support for events ran by others. Our website can be found at www.lanified.com . If you want to contact me through STEAM you can reach me at my profile ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject5587/ ).

Why should you help? Why should you not down-vote this into oblivion? Well, that's up to you, but what I can tell you is what we do and what I want us to do. We work really hard on running high quality gaming events with the intent to grow the gaming culture in Calgary. This constitutes **both** competitive gaming and social gaming. I believe there are a significant number of gamers in Calgary that want to see more of what we do. We continually receive positive feedback supporting this. If you want to help grow the gaming culture in Calgary, you should probably come and help us do that.

Thanks for your time.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I just had an idea and I want someone to prove me how it won't work and is dumb. Or it's actually a good idea.

I'm trying to figure out a way to do real HA for ZFS, the penultimate goal is to have fail-over with no dropped/interrupted connections (0 packet loss, 0 ping spikes, etc). Failing that to get as close as possible.

My current thought is this, all the disks are in external SAS enclosures which are connected to an identical (in model and revision) HBA in two systems.

These two systems run Xen in a Remus configuration ( http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Remus effectively RAM states duplicated in realtime between two hosts) and there is a single VM setup with Remus HA running... say FreeNAS for now.

FreeNAS naturally has the HBA's passed through to it, and the idea is that the instance will fail-over in realtime if one of the  hosts fails. Since the RAM state is maintained on both hosts testing of this method (Remus specifically) I have observed in other demonstrations ~20ms-200ms interruption.

Where/how would this fail and why? Or is this just an awesome idea? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello fellow gamers! With 2015 comes a new year, and with our new year we are bringing you even more awesome gaming! Not only are we announcing our next event today, but we are announcing our next **THREE** events today. All of which you can secure your seat for **right NOW**!

**But subject5587, are you mad?**

Mad about gaming, yeah! Sure, it may be a lot of gaming, but we see so many gamers in Calgary, we want you all to come join us and have a blast! Besides, each of the three events has a different set of tournaments, what a selection!

_Ladies and Gentlemen, LANified! is proud to present our **Best in Calgary** series:_

 **LANified! 19: Running with Knives** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/16/5)

* Counter-Strike: Global Offensive main tournament and mini-tournaments (cash prizing up to $700! + "Best in Calgary" award!)

 **LANified! 20: Jungle Jukes** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/17/5)

* DotA 2 main tournament and mini-tournaments (cash prizing up to $700! + "Best in Calgary" award!)

 **LANified! 21: Summoner's Stand** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/18/5)

* League of Legends main tournament and mini-tournaments (cash prizing up to $700! + "Best in Calgary" award!)

**But subject5587, what do you mean by Best in Calgary?**

In addition to the cash prizes for these events, the first place finalists for the main tournaments will be awarded a glorious plaque declaring "Best in Calgary"! Not only do we want to foster competitions that welcome all players, but we also want to reward those who strive for the top. Each plaque will be personalized after each event with the team's name and the name and handle of each player on that team, then returned to the captain of that team.

**But subject5587, with all those games, are you going to be playing other games?**

Of course we are! These are LAN parties after all, gaming is what it's all about! As people sign up for each event we ask them 3 games they will likely want to play at the LAN party. Then that forms a list ("Game Preference" just below the Tournaments) on the event page, updating with each person who signs up. This way you can find others who want to play a particular game!

**But subject5587, I don't know anyone at your events, should I still come?**

Totally, you really should! LAN parties are social events, it's about getting people together. They are a perfect place to make friends, maybe join a team, or just find people to game with, it's all good! These are all public events so we welcome gamers of all shapes, sizes and such. We run them for YOU!

**But subject5587, I have a question not outlined here or on the event pages, what should I do?**

Well you can either post here, you can reach me at _bloodyiron/ (at@) lanified.com (be sure to remove the extra characters of course), or post on our forums ( http://www.lanified.com/forums/ ). </TEXT>

**But subject5587, are you mad?**

Mad about gaming, yeah! Sure, it may be a lot of gaming, but we see so many gamers in Calgary, we want you all to come join us and have a blast! Besides, each of the three events has a different set of tournaments, what a selection!

_Ladies and Gentlemen, LANified! is proud to present our **Best in Calgary** series:_

 **LANified! 19: Running with Knives** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/16/5)

 **LANified! 20: Jungle Jukes** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/17/5)

In addition to the cash prizes for these events, the first place finalists for the main tournaments will be awarded a glorious plaque declaring "Best in Calgary"! Not only do we want to foster competitions that welcome all players, but we also want to reward those who strive for the top. Each plaque will be personalized after each event with the team's name and the name and handle of each player on that team, then returned to the captain of that team.

This thought started from this post I made: http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportmacgyver/comments/2n94g8/makita_to_usb_adapter/cmbyov9

As you read down the chain some of the thoughts get kind of, curious.

So my challenge to the community is, what could **YOU** do with this device : http://i.imgur.com/9h0rwnh.jpg

	<TEXT> I was wondering if you kind folks wouldn't mind sharing your experience/knowledge on IPS on routers. pfSense can be setup with Snort to just log, or log+block IPS activities. But there are also appliance routers that have their own IPS systems.

What do you know about pfSense's Snort IPS capabilities? What about appliance IPS capabilities?

I really like pfSense, but IPS I'm rather lightweight on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Turns out /r/android doesn't take kindly to this kind of issue, so I suspect this may be a good place to talk about this.

I just upgraded my Nexus 4 to Android 5, and now Exchange Services keeps saying it has crashed, except the prompt to hit Ok/Report only stays up for a few seconds. Then it "crashes" again like 5 seconds later, and keeps doing this.

I've tried rebooting, tried stopping the service, deleting cache, and a few other things.

Anyone seen this, ideas?

It's kind of incredible that Google still can't get EAS shit right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi,

I'm subject5587. You may or may not have heard of me, but I run LANified!, but that's only part of the truth. The other part is that we have a team that **_helps_** me run LANified!, our events and services, and so much more. If you are unfamiliar with what we do I'll cover more of that lower in this post.

**But subject5587, so what?**

Well, we need more help. I want us to do more great things, but in order to do them we need to expand our team. We already have an awesome team, and I think that we should find more awesome people to join.

**But subject5587, what kind of help are we talking about?**

We have one specific position we are looking to fill, and I have a few less than specific positions I want us to fill. Additionally I am open to keen gamers with keen ideas. We welcome everyone to apply for these positions, even if you have no experience; We would prefer that you apply instead of hesitate! Experience helps, but not everyone has it.

 **-Tournament Administrator**

We are looking for someone to join our Tournament Administration team. Primarily we are looking for someone to assist with tournaments at LAN parties but we also would appreciate help with other projects related to tournaments. Should you be interested in this position, please consider the following:

* Have you ever entered a tournament of any size for any purpose (gaming or not)? If so, please tell us about it. Tell us how many tournaments you have entered, what you remember about their formats, what you thought about them (subjectively/personally), what you think could be done to improve tournaments, how you did in them, and/or any other information you would like to include.
* Have you ever ran a competitive team, or participated on a competitive team at any level of competition? This can include participating/running a team simply on a ladder, or all the way up to competing professionally. If so, please tell us all about that.
* Have you ever participated in the operations of a tournament before? If so, what formats are you familiar with, what was your involvement, and any other details you would like to include.
* What interests you about tournaments, their operations, or anything else you would like to express to us.

 **-Non-specific Broadcasting Position**

We are looking for 5-7 people to help us regularly with a project related to Broadcasting that we are working on. There are multiple areas a person can contribute to this, so if one area doesn't work for you another may. Should you be interested in Broadcasting please consider the following:

* Have you ever been involved with any live broadcasting before? Be it a broadcast simply of yourself, an activity you are performing, or a broadcast that involves multiple people and/or activities. If so, please tell us about it/them.
* What do you know about broadcasting?
* What about broadcasting interests you?
* Have you ever done any live or non-live video production? Non-live video production would involve post-recording production and/or distribution. If so, tell us about that.
* What is your schedule like? Where can you contribute from a schedule perspective?
* Do you have a vehicle? (NOT REQUIRED but helps)
* Have you ever been on camera before during a live broadcast? This would include any traditional/network broadcasting, say a news channel interview.
* Is there specific content you would want to be involved with? How flexible are you to content you haven't been involved with before?
* Have you ever operated a video camera?
* Do you have any experience with audio production?
* Have you ever given a speech, presented to an audience, or prepared a presentation?

**To apply to either of these positions please email me bloodyiron - atT - lanified -dotT- com and include as much information as you can relevant to the position you are interested in. Again we WANT your help, so apply already! Additionally if you want to contribute in other areas than what I have listed here, do reach out to me.**

**But subject5587, do I get paid for this?**

These positions are strictly voluntary. We do not compensate for them financially or in other specific ways. That being said, we provide valuable experience that can be put on your resume. Many of those that have helped us have leveraged the experienced gained to move their careers forward.

**But subject5587, who are you? What is LANified!? Why should I help? And why should I not down-vote this into oblivion?**

I am the founder of LANified!. We have been operating for more than 7 years. LANified! has primarily ran LAN parties throughout Calgary, but we have also ran other gaming related events and services. We run gaming servers, a public mumble server, tournaments, and have also provided support for events ran by others. Our website can be found at www.lanified.com . If you want to contact me through STEAM you can reach me at my profile ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject5587/ ).

Why should you help? Why should you not down-vote this into oblivion? Well, that's up to you, but what I can tell you is what we do and what I want us to do. We work really hard on running high quality gaming events with the intent to grow the gaming culture in Calgary. This constitutes **both** competitive gaming and social gaming. I believe there are a significant number of gamers in Calgary that want to see more of what we do. We continually receive positive feedback supporting this. If you want to help grow the gaming culture in Calgary, you should probably come and help us do that.

Thanks for your time.

I am checking out tf2 trading post (tf2tp.com), and it looks alright. But, is there an alternative to tf2outpost that is highly used and close in functionality? Some alternatives I've found to be really clunky, like dispenser.tf. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-10-24 22:05:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Naturally we have system images. We are considering switching the HDDs on some of our laptops to SSDs and I was wondering if we had to adjust our system image for TRIM to be enabled when re-imaging a laptop?

So, we use the OOBE without an answer file (for now) when we capture our system image. Then the laptop gets setup with devices when it's imaged from that image. So, I suspect that TRIM is enabled if an SSD is detected from this process, but I'm not sure.

Does anyone know? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> SATA Transport Protocol + SAS enclosures </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-27 02:52:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

i am trying to find some conclusive material for one way or the other. Consider the application is ZFS for the time being, so HBA's the whole way, no RAID controllers.

In regards to big storage, SAS and SAS enclosures. Using SATA drives in SAS enclosures results in the SATA Transport Protocol being used instead of just native SAS.

Now the first question, what are the limitations, if any, as to how many SATA drives you can reasonably have on a single controller? Let's assume a single 4x SFF-8088 connection, daisy chained as far as we can.

Is there a point where functionality or performance actually starts degrading? Or is it just a ceiling?

Is this ever a BAD idea, and why?

I can't yet find anything conclusive to answer any of these questions in either direction. Please share with me what you can, and try to back it up as best you can with evidence, instead of hearsay.

Thanks :) </TEXT>

I'm of course talking about the areas north of 33rd ave sw and south of 32nd ave nw.

It's always a problem, and when things just happen to go wrong, like an accident, or bad weather, it pretty much destroys travel in this area of the city and traffic spills out all over the place, such as onto 14th st. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm training two young cats to use the Litter Kwitter. One of which is catching on like gang busters, the other not so much for the stage we're at.

Both cats were using it when it was on the ground. But then I moved it to on the toilet, and only one pees and poohs on it. The other one only pees on the seat, but poos on the floor around the toilet.

The weird thing is, a handful of months ago when I was first trying to train them, the second one was pooing on the seat, but unfortunately I had to interrupt that training, and ended up starting over a few months later.

So, I'm not having really any luck or ideas about how to convince the second cat (tuxedo cat named Onyx) to poo on it when it's on the seat.

Please help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LANified!'s Minecraft Multiverse just got even better!

Today we've launched strong counter-griefing mechanisms which guard against problems, while ensuring that people are still welcome to come join the fun!

As of right now every new player is put into an Untrusted group. These players can connect to the Multiverse and scout around, but they cannot interact with the environment at all! This makes it so that players can see what all the fuss is about, decide where they want to pitch camp, and get to know the existing player base (chat still works of course).

So what are you waiting for? Come join in on the awesome action!

Configuring multiple monitors in Unity is quite reasonable.

Doing so in XFCE, is a god damn nightmare.

1) The display settings update IMMEDIATELY when I change them, there's no apply function, so if I accidentally set something wrong, OR HAVEN FORBID I WANT TO CHANGE MORE THAN ONE FUCKING SETTING AT A TIME, it just applies it no matter what.

2) The settings I set are often reverted to some random alternative which I didn't fucking set. Left of X monitor can randomly change to Same as Y monitor, etc.

3) During setting up of the three monitors to be just how I want it to, it decided closing my open applications was an acceptable thing to do. No warning, nothing, just fuck you, you're closing.

4) There's no preview of this process, and sometimes the identify function actually doesn't correctly identify a monitor, especially when you have "same as X monitor" set somewhere.

5) Often the configurations you set don't actually work like they're supposed to. Left of? Fuck you I'm right of, or I'm just cloning a random monitor.

All in all, XFCE may be rather light-weight, but their multiple monitor support is archaic and asinine.

WHAT THE FUCK GUYS. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Are you ready for copious amounts of gaming this weekend? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Time is upon us, and our LAN party is this weekend! But are you ready?

Well, if you're not certain on what to bring, we have a recommended list of what to bring and what not to bring on the event details page ( http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/9 ).

It's pretty common for people to forget just one certain thing, such as a mouse pad, so even if you're a seasoned veteran of LAN parties it's usually a good idea to review what you're bringing before you've left for the event, instead of realizing as you set up that you forgot your power cord.

**But subject5587, what if I'm just coming to spectate or visit?**

Well, at least bring some pants, please. Otherwise, what you bring is up to you. You can always come scope out the event and come back with your equipment later in the day.

Oh, and while I have your attention, I would like to comment on a concern that has been raised to me multiple times. Some people are concerned about what happens if we don't have enough teams at the event. So, what does happen? Well you should know that we currently do team registration at the event (the schedule will be posted later today), and if there are enough teams we run the tournament. However, if there are not enough teams the event **does** continue.

You see, the event isn't just about the tournaments, it's about gaming in many different ways! While there is a possibility that a main tournament may not happen due to insufficient entrant teams, that doesn't mean the rest of the event stops. We will still be running the mini-tournaments, and there will be plenty of social/ad-hoc gaming going on! Many people through our sign-up process have already expressed that they will be playing DotA2 and/or League of Legends, not necessarily in the tournaments, in addition to many other games.

So what are you waiting for, come on down! Join us this weekend and have a blast. For full event details head to: http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/9

	<TEXT> Hey Folks, I'm subject5587. It's likely you have seen me since I run LANified!

There are a lot of DotA 2 players in Calgary, but it seems many of them aren't sure how exactly to connect with each other. Well I believe we can help.

How can we help? We have a lot of people in our STEAM group that are in Calgary and enjoy DotA 2, so check out our STEAM group ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified#members ) as a start.

Additionally, how about you post in this thread? Just say your handle, link to your steam profile, and add whatever else you want. I'm sure many other people will appreciate this; and you may want to join our STEAM group to find others to game with.

But what else can we do to help? Well, next weekend we have our LAN party. We're running a DotA 2 tournament, and there will be plenty of people there playing DotA 2. So even if you're not interested in the tournament, if you come you will find plenty of other people there to play DotA 2 with. If you haven't seen the full details, check them out: http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/8

There are lots of people who play DotA 2 in Calgary, I see them all over the place, and we're working to get us all connected! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Attention fellow gamers! Our absolutely fabulous and awesome upcoming LAN party is just a stone's throw away! **LANified! 17: MOBA Madness** runs from Sat June 21st (10am) to Sun June 22nd (6pm).

**More and more people are signing up and securing their seats by prepaying with every passing day!**

**But subject5587, why should I attend your LAN parties?**

Our LAN parties are the best run LAN parties around! We ensure that you have a fantastic time! There will be main and mini tournaments, social gaming, lots of file sharing and so much more. Our LAN parties are an incredibly social event, where you can meet many gamers just like yourself, beat them in games and make friends while you're at it!

**But subject5587, what tournaments will you be running?**

* DotA 2 5v5 - Round-Robin

* League of Legends 5v5 - Round-Robin

* DotA 2 - Ability Draft - Mini-Tournament

* League of Legends - ARAM - Mini-Tournament

**But subject5587, tournaments are intimidating, do I have to enter them?**

No! Tournaments are completely optional! While they are included in your entrance fee, what you want to do at the event is completely up to you! Tournaments are a structured segment of the event that we run for those that are interested in competition, and we also run less serious mini-tournaments which are incredibly fun in their own right. While everyone is welcome to tournaments, we also welcome you to enjoy many other aspects of the social atmosphere of the LAN instead!

**But subject5587, I need help forming/finding a team, what should I do?**

We recommend you post in this thread: http://www.lanified.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21 t=84185

**But subject5587, how can I know I will have fun at your LAN parties?**

We invite you to scope out the feedback people have left for our past events
