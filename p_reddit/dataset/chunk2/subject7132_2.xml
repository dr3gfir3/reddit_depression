	<TEXT> I recommend a design firm. Palo Alto services lots of freshly minted young millionaires who have homes that either so historic or so centrally located that they cannot or should not be razed. It is a hot bed for design firms, who meet with the home owner, determine the wish list, and then deliver 3D renderings at every stage of conception until the final draft is agreed upon. Some design firms are all-in-one, where they are also the GC and see the process all the way through - from initial renderings through the build.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was once an unwilling participant in this situation. The girl was just over-the-top loud. I wasn't going to let it interrupt our session, but at the same time I knew on some level that it had to be a serious source of aggravation for anyone directly adjoining her condo. Well, the police eventually showed up. Thankfully, post coitus. I answered her door, and there were two cops. One female, one male. Female was by the book, informing me of the noose compliant and asking for cessation. The male stood just a half step behind her, and never spoke a word. He did give me a rather coy thumbs up and, during my reprimand, mouthed, "it's ok". I let them know that it was he girl's condo, and that she was too mortified to come to the door, and that she was quite apologetic. I never revisited the scene of the crime, but I suspect that the next dude didn't get the same level of theatrics that I did.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are an American company. The employee new hire application is several pages, including the new hire information page, the consent to drug test page, the I9 and W4 pages. 

Our employee new hire application is a PDF, and it's auto-fill. For example, if an employee types in their name it fills out remaining areas that require their name. At present, employees type into fields and then print it all out in order to sign. Then they scan / fax to me. 

I'd like to make it totally paperless. And that means making it possible for them to digitally sign. But here is the problem: these employees are not always computer savvy enough to download the necessary tools to do a digital signature. So I need you to make it so easy a child could do it. I want them to be able to sit in their home and to take their mouse and to draw their signature onto the application. 

I am comfortable with an estimate for services. This is something that I'm sure you will want to review, etc., to better familiarize yourself with the document. 

Update: thank you redditors for you myriad of responses. Every one is helpful, and I've no doubt you all can handle this project. Your approaches are, for the most part, unique from one another. I will now take the weekend to review your replies and will then ask questions as needed, in order to determine the candidate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Join a running club. There are some that include bar hopping. But for purposes of giving you a non-drinking option, a running club. Running is in of itself a great tool for releasing serotonin and endorphins. That post-run feeling is pretty awesome. Add to that, sun...Vitamin D. 

Also, consider an SNRI. Pretty good medicine, and these days the generics are available so also cheap. 

Seriously, though...I have to acknowledge the whiskey comment...nothing overcomes social anxiety as well as a few drinks. I just know that one has to be careful; something as good as alcohol can be Pandora's box for someone with social anxiety.

For example:

http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/baybuzz/lgbt-pride-flag-raised-after-orlando-shooting-unbearable-for-christian/2282099

...probably not a prefect reply to your question. 

Without getting into the nuances, I will just say that I hate that our country is still debating whether, say, a rainbow flag or a cake might offend someone, and I really hate that the offendees use - ironically - the laws which protect our amazing freedoms as a basis to argue for their religious "rights" to treat others as lesser people.  </TEXT>

We inadvertently set some metal mesh onto the battery contacts, end all hell broke loose - looked like sparklers. Oops. We quickly finessed the metal, glowing and sparking, off of the battery. But that's not the weird part. This is: The battery disappeared.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of our sales associates are commission only. They are independent contractors. Most do well, once they get going, due to the residual component. And because we are a good company, meaning we retain the customers they bring to us, and we honor our commission obligations in perpetuity. 

In my opinion, the best category of income type is commission. One step up is residual commission. 

The ideal is passive residual commission. Meaning, auto pilot. That's like when you develop your craft - whatever it is that you do - to generate residual income, and then hire others to run it all. To me, replacing one's own job, stepping aside, and yet still collecting income is the best-in-class wealth accumulation strategy to strive for. That way, when you work...it is a choice.  </TEXT>
