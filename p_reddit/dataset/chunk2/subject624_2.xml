	<TEXT> 10 Days with the AW SS and I cant stop wearing it. I was an avid non-smart watch wearer before receiving the AW and i'll never go back! AW has complimented my running regiment perfectly. The only down side is I have caught quite a few people looking at it!

	<TEXT> This trick worked for me too. I would go for a 3 mile run without using workout app and not meet fitness goal. Went for a 30 minute walk using workout app and I meet it!  </TEXT>
