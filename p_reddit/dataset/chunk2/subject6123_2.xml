	<TEXT> Based on...? Breach has brought in more people than ever. It not my opinion but a statistic fact. 

I like D3 for what it is. It's streamlined and works like a charm but... in the end of the road in just doing Greater Rifts at the highest possible level. That's it. In PoE there is so freakn' much to do, stuff you hope that drops and builds the think of. D3 doesn't come anywhere near the build diversity. I just can't imagine myself going back, even with the Necromancer. 

Like I said, I like D3, for what it is
