	<TEXT> Tony went for the big move and Sandra got him, nobody is deny that but your lying to yourself saying she didn't play the same game, there were differences but the main part of her game is "as long as it's not me, I don't care". And saying that this season will be good and could have been even better with Tony is not being up his ass, it's stating the obvious that everyone else is saying. </TEXT>
