	<TEXT> As the D-day is approaching, I would like to ask the questions I always had about that day. Why the American army had to suffer such heavy causalities specially in Omaha beach by exposing the infantry to German MG42 bunkers? Why did ships did not shell the defensive line first? Why no air cover(RAF maybe as their bases were very close)? Why did they not chose weaker points to land?  </TEXT>
