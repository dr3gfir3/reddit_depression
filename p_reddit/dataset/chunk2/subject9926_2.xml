	<TEXT>   the large census in that the traffic is just going to be horrendous but it seems that it'll be like that regardless of where I choose to live (Although, I have also read that Ewa Beach is the worse). I checked google maps and set the time to around when I intend to leave and it seems as long as I head out around 5:30 I should hopefully be fine. Honestly, just seems like something that I'll have to adjust myself to and learn about, among many other things.

No matter how fast you get on island most traffic needs to go back to the mainland. The latency makes the internet seem slow here. My mom has only 30 mbps on the east coast, but it feels faster then my 300 mbps HT fiber line.

No way around the fact we are in the middle of the ocean. It is pretty amazing it is as fast as it is considering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can think of 4 or 5 houses just as bad in kaimuki. We had one around the corner from me in Palolo. Nicest old man in the world lived there, but he had literally mountains of trash, and old bikes. He also had uncontrolled cat colony, and pigeon colony ,so there was shit everywhere.

 I would walk my dog by every night. He just wasn't all there but he was cool AF. Just passed away a few months ago. They buldozed his house and sold it to a chinese guy who plans to throw up a huge rental house. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's perfect I wouldn't change a thing. They say that our choices in cars, and fashion of clothing we wear, are our expression to the world who we are. 

Those around us they pick up social cues from how we present ourselves. To the casual observer the guy in the Mercedes wants to convey wealth, the woman in the loud color mini Cooper wants to let everyone know she is spunky. 

That is why your car is absolutely perfect. At one glance you are conveying to the world that you are a cousin diddling, juggalo, redneck who is trying to put together the money for a pack of Newport's and half a oxy. 

I'm sure this is the look you were going for with a ghost flamed pt cruiser so kudos. Job well done.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I was depressed, and becoming distant to my lovely, and beautiful girlfriend of 10 years. I was so self absorbed that I didn't realize how bad I was hurting her feelings. 

After she tearfully told me how she was feeling I became even more distraught. Over the past few weeks I have been righting the ship on my depression, and trying my hardest to let her know how much I love her, and that she means the world to me. 

We have made a ton of progress, and are back to being lovey dovey for the first time, in a long time. Neither of us are the type to be overly affectionate, but for us this is newlywed levels of PDA.  

We still have work to do, but I think we are back on a good path to a strong partnership, and it makes me very happy that she is happier with me.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It works very well. I got it upgraded with a hybrid drive, but then recently moved to a SSD. With the SSD it is quite snappy. I dont game or do anything extremely intense. That being said it did handle editing some 1080p/60 go pro video with no issues. 

The real benefit of the 2012, is that it is still very modular. It was a 10-15 minute process to swap out the drive. 

My one complaint is that the display GPU technology is a bit out of date. I was planning on getting a 4k monitor, but it won't support it at 60hz. I ended up getting a 1440p monitor which is honestly fine at 32 inches. It does work me that I am limited though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I switched almost exactly one year ago, and was blown away by the speed vs att. It has really deteriorated since. I have switched phones multiple times since, and even recently had my current 7+ swapped out for a unrelated issue. 

In the past month I have had multiple instances of having 3-4 bars of LTE, but barely being able to even go on websites. I haven't had a chance to document what me speed tests would be, but multiple browsers fail to load. 

I rely on my service for work, and I really cannot have this become the new normal. I hate to sound elitist, but I liked being in the higher tier, and I am concerned that they jumped the gun offering unlimited data to everyone. 

I am actually considering going to Verizon. I have been a huge advocate for T-Mobile, but they really need to get their act together, and start buying more back end to handle all this traffic. 

Have they laid out any initiatives to get this managed? </TEXT>

I would like to thank Apple for designing a case so slippery, that it just shoots right out of your coin pocket on your jeans, and gets run right over by a SUV. I share a lot of fault here, I knew how shit the design was and even bought a case, but I opted not to bring it tonight. 

I consider myself lucky I was able to retrace my bike ride only 2 miles back from my house to find the case unharmed, but one airpod totaled. 

There really had to be a better more functional design the a dental floss container. Some sharp edges, and texture would really go miles to making these less hard to lose. 

After I pay my $80 for one replacement airpod, I will be covering my floss case with grip tape from a skateboard.  

I am pretty salty right now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have 4 lines for $150. My big thing was tethering, I need a few GB per month, but will never go close to 10 GB. Honestly they have still been deprioritizing me pretty badly lately anyway.

I can't see any catches, and with the fees this would save me $30 per month. Never thought there would be a better plan then SC, but on face value this  seems even better.

I could really use that extra 128kbps international as well.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

I am running a bit low on discretionary income this month, so I want keep it under $100. 

I was looking at the anker xl Bluetooth speaker on amazon for $60, and the Bose computer speakers for $100. I have heard the bose, and they sound excellent. 

It seems crazy to me that a whole market hasn't sprung up for speakers designed to fit exactly under the dot as a cohesive package. Seems like it would be a no brained to get a slice of the market. 

What is the best small speaker I can get for $100? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those who don't know Cadillac debuted a new subscription ownership model today. $1500 per month, and you have your choice of any fully loaded Cadillac. You can switch between models anytime, up to 18 times per year. Escalade for the road trip, then right back to your cts-v platinum for your commute. All maintenance, and insurance is included in the $1500. 

No long term obligation, and no worries about lease returns over mileage etc. When you are done just turn in the car. 

https://www.google.com/amp/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2017/1/5/14177698/cadillac-book-car-subscription-service-1500-a-month?client=safari

I think this may be a stroke of genius. I am certainly not in the demographic of people with $1500 per month to spend on my choice of any fully loaded Cadillac. However I think this could really translate well to other segments of the car market. This would be especially true if a company could do this across multiple brands. 

Imagine if their was a service for say $5-600 that had a bunch of fun cars to choose from in the $30,000 range like Gtis, Tacoma's, camaros etc. Or scale it to a higher price like $7-800 for mid level luxury cars. 

I would be all over that to sample a bunch of different cars without the stress of dealing with a dealership Everytime, and never worrying about maintenance again. 
The company could just do as the rental car companies do, and blow out the cars after 20,000 miles for pretty good money. 

I would gladly pay a few extra $$$ per month to have the flexibility of just changing cars on a whim.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really wish I could get a dedicated remote to control my DTV now, or VUE services. Being limited to the paired down UI makes it a huge pita to get around the service. I really miss being able to key in a channel, and just go there. As it stands on my nvidia shield, ATV, PS4 etc to get from one channel to another is like a 70 button tap ordeal.

I know that this is a long shot but these services need to roll out their own remotes to work with streaming boxes if they want to ever go mainstream. I'm sure if I took away my moms cable remote, and gave her a ATV with OTT streaming she would ninja star the remote through the TV within 15 minutes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Left for android back when the S7 edge came out. Had said S7 edge, note 7, and V20 since then. Never really had any complaints about the battery life, but there was no way I could make it through a day without charging any of them. 

Yesterday I was waiting for a call, and had nothing to do but play around with my new phone for hours. Never plugged it in, and got home with 30% left. 

So far I am getting close to iPad levels of battery life. I don't recall my IPhone 6, or 6+ being anywhere near this good. 

I really was anticipating moving to the S8 in a few months, but if it stays like this I may just stick with iOS. The locked down home screen UI, and lack of app drawer is still maddening though lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a pristine BMW e91 wagon, that is way to nice for my lifestyle. I don't want to let my dog in it, or put sporting goods inside. Time for a SUV. 

Main goal is reliability, and $10,000 is the top of my budget. 

Right now there seem to be quite a few cherry 3rd gens including one TRD supercharged one in that price range. 

Gonna check this out tomorrow

http://honolulu.craigslist.org/oah/cto/5926114105.html


Going to 4th gen still nets you a pretty decent one but maybe a bit rougher around the edges. 

I notice a lot of the third gens mention the timing belt, and starter. Is that a real common failure? Is going for the supercharger more trouble then it is worth? 

If I really just prioritize low maintenance ownership what is the best year/trim etc. Aesthetically I like the third gen better, but the interior on the fourth looks like a nicer place to be. Whichever one I get will receive a new stereo leveling kit, and some AT tires. 


Thanks.  </TEXT>

The picture has a kind of hazy softness to it. Kinda made me nuts before,but I just upgraded to a huge 4k tv, and the difference is stark. I was watching a NBAgame today,and had to switch over to my shield since it was so low quality. 

Games run fine,i have extremely fast internet, and am connected Ethernet right to router. I get about 100 on the internal sppedtest.  No other device I own has this problem.

	<TEXT> I have had a 55 inch 4k tv for a few years now. It has served me well, but after watching a movie on a friend's 75 inch Samsung I am having so size envy. 

Unfortunately i do not have $4000 to spend. Looking in the $1000-1500 range, and there are quite a few 65 inch displays in that segment.

 I was pretty set on grabbing a Sony from BB for $1000. Then I saw that Costco has a 70 inch Vizio with some basic local dimming for the same price. 

Those 5 inches don't sound like much but a 70 is way bigger then a 65, and I really want that imax experience in my living room. 

The BB guy was trying to convince me to go up to $1500 on a HDR 65 inch Sony.  It did look marginally better but I am not a picture quality whore. I watched the Vizio for a good 15 minutes and I am satisfied with the colors. 

Any advice? Will I regret not going for a high end set? </TEXT>
