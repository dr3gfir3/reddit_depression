Abstract

 Fast and simultaneous forward and reverse blood grouping has long remained elusive. Forward blood grouping detects antigens on red blood cells, whereas reverse grouping identifies specific antibodies present in plasma. We developed a paper-based assay using immobilized antibodies and bromocresol green dye for rapid and reliable blood grouping, where dye-assisted color changes corresponding to distinct blood components provide a visual readout. ABO antigens and five major Rhesus antigens could be detected within 30 s, and simultaneous forward and reverse ABO blood grouping using small volumes (100 l) of whole blood was achieved within 2 min through on-chip plasma separation without centrifugation. A machine-learning method was developed to classify the spectral plots corresponding to dye-based color changes, which enabled reproducible automatic grouping. Using optimized operating parameters, the dye-assisted paper assay exhibited comparable accuracy and reproducibility to the classical gel-card assays in grouping 3550 human blood samples. When translated to the assembly line and low-cost manufacturing, the proposed approach may be developed into a cost-effective and robust universal blood-grouping platform. </TEXT>

Autologous Induced Stem-CellDerived Retinal Cells for Macular Degeneration
Michiko Mandai, M.D., Ph.D., Akira Watanabe, Ph.D., Yasuo Kurimoto, M.D., Ph.D., Yasuhiko Hirami, M.

March 16, 2017

N Engl J Med 2017; 376:1038-1046

Abstract

 We assessed the feasibility of transplanting a sheet of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in a patient with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The iPSCs were generated from skin fibroblasts obtained from two patients with advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration and were differentiated into RPE cells. The RPE cells and the iPSCs from which they were derived were subject to extensive testing. A surgery that included the removal of the neovascular membrane and transplantation of the autologous iPSC-derived RPE cell sheet under the retina was performed in one of the patients. At 1 year after surgery, the transplanted sheet remained intact, best corrected visual acuity had not improved or worsened, and cystoid macular edema was present.

Abstract:

 The Ebola virus vaccine strategies evaluated by the World Health Organization in response to the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa included a heterologous primary and booster vaccination schedule of the adenovirus type 26 vector vaccine encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV) and the modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, and Tai Forest viruses nucleoprotein (MVA-BN-Filo). This schedule has been shown to induce immune responses that persist for 8 months after primary immunization, with 100% of vaccine recipients retaining Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific antibodies.1

Sulfate radicals enable a non-enzymatic Krebs cycle precursor

Markus A. Keller, Domen Kampjut[]Markus Ralser

Nature Ecology   Evolution 1, Article number: 0083 (2017)

Published online: 13 March 2017

Abstract

 The evolutionary origins of the Krebs cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) are not currently clear. Despite the existence of a simple non-enzymatic Krebs cycle catalyst being dismissed only a few years ago as an appeal to magic, citrate and other intermediates have since been discovered on a carbonaceous meteorite and do interconvert non-enzymatically. To identify a metabolism-like non-enzymatic Krebs cycle catalyst, we used combinatorial, quantitative high-throughput metabolomics to systematically screen iron and sulfate compounds in a reaction mixture that orients on the typical components of Archaean sediment. Krebs cycle intermediates were found to be stable in water and in the presence of most molecule species, including simple iron sulfate minerals. However, in the presence of sulfate radicals generated from peroxydisulfate, the intermediates underwent 24 interconversion reactions. These non-enzymatic reactions covered the critical topology of the oxidative Krebs cycle, the glyoxylate shunt and the succinic-semialdehyde pathway. Assembled in a chemical network, the reactions achieved over 90% carbon recovery. Our results show that a non-enzymatic precursor of the Krebs cycle is biologically sensible, efficient, and forms spontaneously in the presence of sulfate radicals.

 The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or Krebs cycle, is a central metabolic pathway, typically of oxidative function. This metabolic pathway provides precursors for the biosynthesis of amino acids, and plays an essential role in fatty-acid breakdown, cellular respiration, and energy and redox metabolism1. The widespread occurrence of at least its oxidative reactions2,3 indicates that at least parts of the Krebs cycle originated at a very early stage in evolution; perhaps dating back to the origin of life4,5,6. A frequently discussed hypothesis proposes that the Krebs cycle obtained its structural topology by Darwinian selection principles that were enabled by the ribonucleic acid (RNA) world. A post-genetic origin implies that pathway topologies are subject to progressive change, implying that the modern Krebs cycle could differ substantially from its early precursors7. However, a post-genetic origin of metabolism struggles to explain how multiple, structurally complex enzymes came into being initially; enzymes themselves are made-up from the metabolic products of the Krebs cycle. Second, a Darwinian origin for the metabolic network topology has difficulties in explaining the high number of reactions that recur between kingdoms despite a lack of enzyme sequence conservation8. An alternative hypothesis thus proposes that at least the key metabolic reactions originated from environmental chemistry. In this scenario, inorganic catalysis determines the basic structure of metabolism9,10,11,12.

 As enzymatic mechanisms of the Krebs cycle have limited resemblance to inorganic catalysis, the idea of a non-enzymatic origin was received sceptically by many5,13. For instance, Leslie Orgel, a leading scientist in shaping the RNA world hypothesis, dismissed the possibility that a simple inorganic catalyst that could replace a series set of TCA-like reactions as an appeal to magic5. However, despite the fact that a simple catalyst was indeed missing, others have argued that several Krebs cycle metabolites form in organic chemical reactions9,10. Meanwhile, the presence of a series of TCA intermediates has been confirmed on a carbonaceous meteorite14. Furthermore, citrate and other TCA intermediates undergo highly efficient reductive interconversion reactions on semiconductor particles when exposed to strong ultraviolet light15. A non-enzymatic precursor to the Krebs cycle is therefore catalytically possible. Moreover, the existence of a unifying, simple catalyst has become plausible. Non-enzymatic reactions that replicate two other metabolic pathways, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, are united in their common dependence on ferrous iron as the catalyst and co-substrate16,17. Fe(II) is abundant in typical Archaean sediments18,19, implying that general chemical environments, rather than niche conditions, may have been key to shaping the structure of metabolic pathways.

 We chose a systematic screening strategy whereby ~4,850 absolute quantitative experiments were performed to examine the reactivity of TCA intermediates in the presence of typical Archaean sediment constituents, as well as related iron and sulfur species. We found that the TCA intermediates were unreactive in the presence of the majority of iron and sulfate combinations, including the simple mineral, ferrous sulfide (FeS). However, in the presence of the radical donor peroxydisulfate, we detected 24 non-enzymatic interconversion reactions. These reactions resemble the isomerization and oxidative reactions of the enzymatic Krebs cycle, the glyoxylate shunt and the succinic semialdehyde pathway, so that their critical topologies are covered. A chemical network assembled from these reactions achieves more than 90% carbon recovery, forming a plausible non-enzymatic precursor for the origin of the early Krebs cycle. </TEXT>

Would You Deliver an Electric Shock in 2015? Obedience in the Experimental Paradigm Developed by Stanley Milgram in the 50 Years Following the Original Studies

Dariusz Doliski, Tomasz Grzyb, Micha Folwarczny, Patrycja Grzybaa, Karolina Krzyszycha, Karolina Martynowska, Jakub Trojanowski

Social Psychological and Personality Science

Article first published online: January 1, 2017

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550617693060

Abstract

 In spite of the over 50 years which have passed since the original experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram on obedience, these experiments are still considered a turning point in our thinking about the role of the situation in human behavior. While ethical considerations prevent a full replication of the experiments from being prepared, a certain picture of the level of obedience of participants can be drawn using the procedure proposed by Burger. In our experiment, we have expanded it by controlling for the sex of participants and of the learner. The results achieved show a level of participants obedience toward instructions similarly high to that of the original Milgram studies. Results regarding the influence of the sex of participants and of the learner, as well as of personality characteristics, do not allow us to unequivocally accept or reject the hypotheses offered.

Link to Wikipedia article on original Milgram experiment:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment

 The Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience; the experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of people were prepared to obey, albeit unwillingly, even if apparently causing serious injury and distress. Milgram first described his research in 1963 in an article published in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology[1] and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View.[2] </TEXT>

Identification of methylation haplotype blocks aids in deconvolution of heterogeneous tissue samples and tumor tissue-of-origin mapping from plasma DNA

Abstract:

 Adjacent CpG sites in mammalian genomes can be co-methylated owing to the processivity of methyltransferases or demethylases, yet discordant methylation patterns have also been observed, which are related to stochastic or uncoordinated molecular processes. We focused on a systematic search and investigation of regions in the full human genome that show highly coordinated methylation. We defined 147,888 blocks of tightly coupled CpG sites, called methylation haplotype blocks, after analysis of 61 whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data sets and validation with 101 reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing data sets and 637 methylation array data sets. Using a metric called methylation haplotype load, we performed tissue-specific methylation analysis at the block level. Subsets of informative blocks were further identified for deconvolution of heterogeneous samples. Finally, using methylation haplotypes we demonstrated quantitative estimation of tumor load and tissue-of-origin mapping in the circulating cell-free DNA of 59 patients with lung or colorectal cancer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'll still need biopsies to work out the cell morphology for cancer staging, DNA typing etc which is important for treatment ultimately - I think this may potentially be more useful for initially screening/ confirmation of diagnosis and general location of the tumour, to guide the next steps, which is less invasive and more timely compared to having to wait for a biopsy of a mass or cyst. I agree with you - nothing beats actual tissue so you know what you're dealing with. </TEXT>

Childhood Gender-Typed Behavior and Adolescent Sexual Orientation: A Longitudinal Population-Based Study.

Li, Gu; Kung, Karson T. F.; Hines, Melissa

Developmental Psychology, Feb 20 , 2017, No Pagination Specified. 

http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000281

Abstract

 Lesbian and gay individuals have been reported to show more interest in other-sex, and/or less interest in same-sex, toys, playmates, and activities in childhood than heterosexual counterparts. Yet, most of the relevant evidence comes from retrospective studies or from prospective studies of clinically referred, extremely gender nonconforming children. In addition, findings are mixed regarding the relation between childhood gender-typed behavior and the later sexual orientation spectrum from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively lesbian/gay. The current study drew a sample (2,428 girls and 2,169 boys) from a population-based longitudinal study, and found that the levels of gender-typed behavior at ages 3.5 and 4.75 years, although less so at age 2.5 years, significantly and consistently predicted adolescents sexual orientation at age 15 years, both when sexual orientation was conceptualized as 2 groups or as a spectrum. In addition, within-individual change in gender-typed behavior during the preschool years significantly related to adolescent sexual orientation, especially in boys. These results suggest that the factors contributing to the link between childhood gender-typed behavior and sexual orientation emerge during early development. Some of those factors are likely to be nonsocial, because nonheterosexual individuals appear to diverge from gender norms regardless of social encouragement to conform to gender roles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

This is clearly a controversial topic dealing with potential gender stereotypes, and the Science commentary article states this here:

 Others dispute the papers methods and significance. Parents own beliefs and biases about gender almost certainly influence how they described their childrens gendered play, which could skew their reporting, says Patrick Ryan Grzanka, a psychologist who studies sexuality and multicultural issues at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. But more worrisome to him are the cultural assumptions underlying the study itself. The authors appear to regard gender nonconformity as the primary marker of gayness, which doesnt align with current research suggesting that your individual preferences for either stereotypically male or female behaviors and traits has little to do with your sexual orientation, he says.

 Grzanka is also dismayed that the paper fails to critique the history of similar research that investigated whether childhood behaviors lined up with eventual sexual orientation. It wasnt long ago that such research was used to stigmatize and pathologize gender-nonconforming children, he says. I think its important to ask why were so invested in this purported link [between gender conformity and sexuality] in the first place.

But it is a large longitudinal population-based study over a long time that I thought was worth sharing even though the finding may be deemed controversial by some. 

I want to point out that this was an observational study and that the finding is one of correlation, not causation. The researchers postulate that toddler play may be potentially predictive of teenage sexual orientation. No one is saying there is a causal relationship. Don't jump to conclusions and force your kids to play or not play with certain types of toys because you think there is a causal relationship. This is not that type of study. 

Due to the sensitive nature of the topic, please restrict comments to the scientific discussion of the findings rather than personal anecdotes. Anti-gay sentiment or homophobic statements of any sort will be removed by the mods.

Abstract:

 Introduction

 Although findings concerning sexual outcomes associated with cyberpornography use are mixed, viewing explicit sexual content online is becoming a common activity for an increasing number of individuals.

 Aim

 To investigate heterogeneity in cyberpornography-related sexual outcomes by examining a theoretically and clinically based model suggesting that individuals who spend time viewing online pornography form three distinct profiles (recreational, at-risk, and compulsive) and to examine whether these profiles were associated with sexual well-being, sex, and interpersonal context of pornography use.

 Methods

 The present cluster-analytic study was conducted using a convenience sample of 830 adults who completed online self-reported measurements of cyberpornography use and sexual well-being, which included sexual satisfaction, compulsivity, avoidance, and dysfunction.

 Main Outcomes Measures

 Dimensions of cyberpornography use were assessed using the Cyber Pornography Use Inventory. Sexual well-being measurements included the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction, the Sexual Compulsivity Scale, the Sexual Avoidance Subscale, and the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale.

 Results

 Cluster analyses indicated three distinct profiles: recreational (75.5%), highly distressed non-compulsive (12.7%), and compulsive (11.8%). Recreational users reported higher sexual satisfaction and lower sexual compulsivity, avoidance, and dysfunction, whereas users with a compulsive profile presented lower sexual satisfaction and dysfunction and higher sexual compulsivity and avoidance. Highly distressed less active users were sexually less satisfied and reported less sexual compulsivity and more sexual dysfunction and avoidance. A larger proportion of women and of dyadic users was found among recreational users, whereas solitary users were more likely to be in the highly distressed less active profile and men were more likely to be in the compulsive profile.

 Conclusion

 This pattern of results confirms the existence of recreational and compulsive profiles but also demonstrates the existence of an important subgroup of not particularly active, yet highly distressed consumers. Cyberpornography users represent a heterogeneous population, in which each subgroup is associated with specific sexual outcomes. </TEXT>

Summary:

 In a study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, scientists surveyed viewers of internet porn and identified that these individuals cluster in three distinct behavioral patterns: recreational, highly distressed non-compulsive, and compulsive.

 The researchers established these clusters after analyzing survey responses from 830 people aged 18 to 78. 71.8 percent of respondents were women, and 28.2 were men. The survey asked people about their cyberpornography viewing habits, as well as three dimensions of pornography use: sexual satisfaction, sexual avoidance, and sexual dysfunction.

 They found that 75.5 percent of users fit a recreational profile, which meant that they rated low on the three measures of pornography use.

 The researchers defined the second cluster, constituting 12.7 percent of survey respondents, as highly distressed non-compulsive. This meant they reported high levels of emotional distress associated with porn viewing habits, but they arent compulsive users and dont spend a lot of time hunting for porn.

 The third profile, compulsive, included 11.8 percent of respondents. This group is the reverse of the second group, spending lots of time seeking out explicit content and indulging in it compulsively, but reporting low levels of emotional distress associated with it. </TEXT>

Deep-Time Convergence in Rove Beetle Symbionts of Army Ants

Munetoshi Maruyama, Joseph Parker

Highlights

Army ant-parasitic rove beetles comprise an ancient system of complex convergence
Beetles anatomically mimic and deceive host ants to exploit nest resources
Convergent clades arose in the Cenozoic and share a Cretaceous common ancestor
Convergence over deep time challenges the notion of evolutionary contingency

Summary

 Recent adaptive radiations provide striking examples of convergence [1, 2, 3, 4], but the predictability of evolution over much deeper timescales is controversial, with a scarcity of ancient clades exhibiting repetitive patterns of phenotypic evolution [5, 6]. Army ants are ecologically dominant arthropod predators of the worlds tropics, with large nomadic colonies housing diverse communities of socially parasitic myrmecophiles [7]. Remarkable among these are many species of rove beetle (Staphylinidae) that exhibit ant-mimicking myrmecoid body forms and are behaviorally accepted into their aggressive hosts societies: emigrating with colonies and inhabiting temporary nest bivouacs, grooming and feeding with workers, but also consuming the brood [8, 9, 10, 11]. Here, we demonstrate that myrmecoid rove beetles are strongly polyphyletic, with this adaptive morphological and behavioral syndrome having evolved at least 12 times during the evolution of a single staphylinid subfamily, Aleocharinae. Each independent myrmecoid clade is restricted to one zoogeographic region and highly host specific on a single army ant genus. Dating estimates reveal that myrmecoid clades are separated by substantial phylogenetic distancesas much as 105 million years. All such groups arose in parallel during the Cenozoic, when army ants diversified into modern genera [12] and rose to ecological dominance [13, 14]. This work uncovers a rare example of an ancient system of complex morphological and behavioral convergence, with replicate beetle lineages following a predictable phenotypic trajectory during their parasitic adaptation to host colonies.

	<TEXT> Great question. 

From the article itself:

 "While the pain-relieving qualities of green LED are clear, exactly how it works remains a puzzle," says Rajesh Khanna, UA associate professor of pharmacology and senior author of the study. "Early studies show that green light is increasing the levels of circulating endogenous opioids, which may explain the pain-relieving effects. Whether this will be observed in humans is not yet known and needs further work."

So the answer in humans is, maybe, but we need more research to confirm.  </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Treatments for chronic pain are inadequate, and new options are needed. Nonpharmaceutical approaches are especially attractive with many potential advantages including safety. Light therapy has been suggested to be beneficial in certain medical conditions such as depression, but this approach remains to be explored for modulation of pain. We investigated the effects of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), in the visible spectrum, on acute sensory thresholds in naive rats as well as in experimental neuropathic pain. Rats receiving green LED light (wavelength 525 nm, 8 h/d) showed significantly increased paw withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus; this antinociceptive effect persisted for 4 days after termination of last exposure without development of tolerance. No apparent side effects were noted and motor performance was not impaired. Despite LED exposure, opaque contact lenses prevented antinociception. Rats fitted with green contact lenses exposed to room light exhibited antinociception arguing for a role of the visual system. Antinociception was not due to stress/anxiety but likely due to increased enkephalins expression in the spinal cord. Naloxone reversed the antinociception, suggesting involvement of central opioid circuits. Rostral ventromedial medulla inactivation prevented expression of light-induced antinociception suggesting engagement of descending inhibition. Green LED exposure also reversed thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in rats with spinal nerve ligation. Pharmacological and proteomic profiling of dorsal root ganglion neurons from green LED-exposed rats identified changes in calcium channel activity, including a decrease in the N-type (CaV2.2) channel, a primary analgesic target. Thus, green LED therapy may represent a novel, nonpharmacological approach for managing pain. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Objective

 To examine associations between insufficient sleep and neurobehavioral functioning in childhood as reported by mothers and teachers.

 Methods

 Participants were 1046 children in a pre-birth cohort study. Main exposures were insufficient sleep durations at three time points: 6 months to 2 years, defined as sleep  11 hours/day, 11-12 hours/day (v.  12); 3 to 4 years, defined as sleep  10 hours/day, 10-11 hours/day (v. 11); and 5 to 7 years, sleep  9 hours/day, 9-10 hours/day (v.  10). Outcomes at age 7 were executive function, behavior, and social-emotional functioning, assessed by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Higher scores indicate poorer functioning. Mothers and teachers completed both instruments independently.

 Results

 At age 7, mean (SD) mother and teacher report of the BRIEF global executive composite scale were 48.3 (7.9) and 50.7 (9.4) points, respectively, and of the SDQ total difficulties score was 6.5 (4.7) and 6.2 (5.7). In multivariable models, children who slept 10 hours/day at 3-4 years had worse maternal-reported scores for the BRIEF (2.11 points; 95% CI: 0.17, 4.05) and SDQ (1.91 points; 95% CI: 0.78, 3.05) than those with age-appropriate sleep. Children who slept 9 hours/day at 5-7 years also had worse scores. At both ages, associations with teacher-reported results were consistent with mothers. Infants who slept 11-12 hours/day had higher teacher- but not mother-reported scores.

 Conclusions

 Insufficient sleep in the preschool and early school years is associated with poorer mother- and teacher-reported neurobehavioral processes in mid-childhood. </TEXT>

Abstract

 Separate literatures have related volunteering to health gains and income gains. We study the association between volunteering, income and health within one statistical framework. A state-of-the-art mediation analysis is conducted on data concerning the health, volunteering and sociodemographic characteristics of 42926 individuals within 29 European countries. We find that volunteering is positively associated to self-rated health. This association is partially mediated by household income. </TEXT>

Exposure of in-pram babies to airborne particles during morning drop-in and afternoon pick-up of school children

Environmental Pollution

Available online 6 March 2017,

Abstract:

 In-pram babies are more susceptible to air pollution effects, yet studies assessing their exposure are limited. We measured size-resolved particle mass (PMC; 0.2532 m) and number (PNC; 0.21 m) concentrations on a 2.7 km route. The instruments were placed inside a baby pram. The route passed through 4 traffic intersections (TIs) and a bus stand. A total of 87 km road length was covered through 64 trips, made during school drop-in (morning) and pick-up (afternoon) hours. The objectives were to assess PMC and PNC exposure to in-pram babies at different route segments, understand their physicochemical characteristics and exposure differences between in-pram babies and adults carrying them. Over 5-fold variability (14.178.2 g m3) was observed in PMCs. Small-sized particles, including ultrafine particles, were always higher by 66% (PM1), 29% (PM2.5) and 31% (PNC) during the morning than afternoon. Coarse particles (PM2.5-10) showed an opposite trend with 70% higher concentration during afternoon than morning. TIs emerged as pollution hotspots for all the particle types. For example, PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PNCs during the morning (afternoon) at TIs were 7 (10)%, 19 (10)% and 68 (62)% higher, respectively, compared with the rest of the route. Bus stand was also a section of enhanced exposure to PNC and PM2.5, although not so much for PM2.5-10. EDX analyses revealed Cl, Na and Fe as dominant elements. Road salt might be a source of NaCl due to de-icing during the measurements while Fe contributed by non-exhaust emissions from brake abrasion. The respiratory deposition rates imitated the trend of PMC, with higher doses of coarse and fine particles during the afternoon and morning runs, respectively. Special protection measures during conveyance of in-pram babies, especially at pollution hotspots such as traffic intersections and bus stands, could help to limit their exposure.

Abstract:

 Background

 Children are exposed to flame retardants from the built environment. Brominated diphenyl ethers (BDE) and organophosphate-based flame retardants (OPFRs) are associated with poorer neurocognitive functioning in children. Less is known, however, about the association between these classes of compounds and childrens emotional and social behaviors. The objective of this study was to determine if flame retardant exposure was associated with measurable differences in social behaviors among children ages 35 years.

 Methods

 We examined teacher-rated social behaviors measured using the Social Skills Improvement Rating Scale (SSIS) and personal exposure to flame retardants in children aged 35 years who attended preschool (n=72). Silicone passive samplers worn for 7 days were used to assess personal exposure to 41 compounds using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometer. These concentrations were then summed into total BDE and total OPFR exposure prior to natural log transformation. Separate generalized additive models were used to evaluate the relationship between seven subscales of the SSIS and lnBDE or lnOPFR adjusting for other age, sex, adverse social experiences, and family context.

 Results

 All children were exposed to a mixture of flame retardant compounds. We observed a dose dependent relationship between lnOPFR and two subscales where children with higher exposures were rated by their preschool teachers as having less responsible behavior (p=0.07) and more externalizing behavior problems (p=0.03). Additionally, children with higher lnBDE exposure were rated by teachers as less assertive (p=0.007).

 Conclusions

 We observed a cross-sectional association between childrens exposure to flame retardant compounds and teacher-rated social behaviors among preschool-aged children. Children with higher flame retardant exposures exhibited poorer social skills in three domains that play an important role in a childs ability to succeed academically and socially. </TEXT>

Public perceptions of arguments supporting and opposing recreational marijuana legalization

Emma E. McGintyJeff NiederdeppeKathryn HeleyColleen L. Barry

Highlights

 Strong arguments in favor of recreational marijuana legalization focus on economic benefits.
 Respondents who agree with economic arguments are more likely to support legalization.
 Supportive economic arguments are stronger than opposing public health arguments.

Abstract

 In debates about recreational marijuana legalization, pro-legalization arguments highlighting economic and other potential policy benefits compete with anti-legalization arguments emphasizing public health risks. In 2016, we conducted a national survey using an online panel (N = 979) designed to answer two main research questions: (1) How do Americans perceive the relative strength of competing arguments about recreational marijuana legalization? (2) How are perceptions of argument strength associated with public support for recreational marijuana legalization? We examined differences in attitudes among individuals living in states that have/have not legalized recreational marijuana and among Democrats/Independents/Republicans. Ordered logit regression assessed the relationship between perceived argument strength and public support for recreational marijuana legalization. Respondents rated pro-legalization arguments highlighting beneficial economic and criminal justice consequences as more persuasive than anti-legalization arguments emphasizing adverse public health effects. Respondents were more likely to agree with arguments highlighting legalization's potential to increase tax revenue (63.9%) and reduce prison overcrowding (62.8%) than arguments emphasizing negative consequences on motor vehicle crashes (51.8%) and youth health (49.6%). The highest rated anti-legalization arguments highlighted the conflict between state and federal marijuana laws (63.0%) and asserted that legalization will fail to eliminate the black market (57.2%). Respondents who endorsed pro-legalization economic and criminal justice arguments were more likely than other respondents to support legalization. Our findings indicate that, on both side of the recreational marijuana legalization debate, there are arguments that resonate with the American public. However, public health risk messages were viewed as less compelling than pro-legalization economic and criminal justice-oriented arguments.

Abstract:

 Electrochemical analysis of sweat using soft bioelectronics on human skin provides a new route for noninvasive glucose monitoring without painful blood collection. However, sweat-based glucose sensing still faces many challenges, such as difficulty in sweat collection, activity variation of glucose oxidase due to lactic acid secretion and ambient temperature changes, and delamination of the enzyme when exposed to mechanical friction and skin deformation. Precise point-of-care therapy in response to the measured glucose levels is still very challenging. We present a wearable/disposable sweat-based glucose monitoring device integrated with a feedback transdermal drug delivery module. Careful multilayer patch design and miniaturization of sensors increase the efficiency of the sweat collection and sensing process. Multimodal glucose sensing, as well as its real-time correction based on pH, temperature, and humidity measurements, maximizes the accuracy of the sensing. The minimal layout design of the same sensors also enables a strip-type disposable device. Drugs for the feedback transdermal therapy are loaded on two different temperature-responsive phase change nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are embedded in hyaluronic acid hydrogel microneedles, which are additionally coated with phase change materials. This enables multistage, spatially patterned, and precisely controlled drug release in response to the patients glucose level. The system provides a novel closed-loop solution for the noninvasive sweat-based management of diabetes mellitus. </TEXT>

Highlights

* Memory champions show distributed functional brain network connectivity changes
* Mnemonic strategies for superior memory can be learned by naive subjects
* Mnemonic training induces similarity with memory champion brain connectivity
* Brain network dynamics of this effect differ between task and resting state

Summary

 Memory skills strongly differ across the general population; however, little is known about the brain characteristics supporting superior memory performance. Here we assess functional brain network organization of 23 of the worlds most successful memory athletes and matched controls with fMRI during both task-free resting state baseline and active memory encoding. We demonstrate that, in a group of naive controls, functional connectivity changes induced by 6 weeks of mnemonic training were correlated with the network organization that distinguishes athletes from controls. During rest, this effect was mainly driven by connections between rather than within the visual, medial temporal lobe and default mode networks, whereas during task it was driven by connectivity within these networks. Similarity with memory athlete connectivity patterns predicted memory improvements up to 4 months after training. In conclusion, mnemonic training drives distributed rather than regional changes, reorganizing the brains functional network organization to enable superior memory performance. </TEXT>

Time for a booster shot? Open wide instead

 No one likes to be on the receiving end of a needle, which can make routine childhood vaccinations especially problematic. Aran et al. developed a needle-free drug delivery device that can be administered orally. The MucoJet device used a simple chemical reaction to deliver a jet of vaccinein this case, ovalbuminthat penetrated the buccal mucosa when placed against the cheek inside the oral cavity in rabbits. The rabbits showed evidence of anti-ovalbumin antibodies in cheek tissue and ear vein blood draws up to 6 weeks after vaccination.

Abstract

 Noninvasive immunization technologies have the potential to revolutionize global health by providing easy-to-administer vaccines at low cost, enabling mass immunizations during pandemics. Existing technologies such as transdermal microneedles are costly, deliver drugs slowly, and cannot generate mucosal immunity, which is important for optimal immunity against pathogens. We present a needle-free microjet immunization device termed MucoJet, which is a three-dimensional microelectromechanical systemsbased drug delivery technology. MucoJet is administered orally, placed adjacent to the buccal tissue within the oral cavity, and uses a self-contained gas-generating chemical reaction within its two-compartment plastic housing to produce a high-pressure liquid jet of vaccine. We show that the vaccine jet ejected from the MucoJet device is capable of penetrating the buccal mucosal layer in silico, in porcine buccal tissue ex vivo, and in rabbits in vivo. Rabbits treated with ovalbumin by MucoJet delivery have antibody titers of anti-ovalbumin immunoglobulins G and A in blood serum and buccal tissue, respectively, that are three orders of magnitude higher than rabbits receiving free ovalbumin delivered topically by a dropper in the buccal region. MucoJet has the potential to accelerate the development of noninvasive oral vaccines, given its ability to elicit antibody production that is detectable locally in the buccal tissue and systemically via the circulation. </TEXT>

 No one likes to be on the receiving end of a needle, which can make routine childhood vaccinations especially problematic. Aran et al. developed a needle-free drug delivery device that can be administered orally. The MucoJet device used a simple chemical reaction to deliver a jet of vaccinein this case, ovalbuminthat penetrated the buccal mucosa when placed against the cheek inside the oral cavity in rabbits. The rabbits showed evidence of anti-ovalbumin antibodies in cheek tissue and ear vein blood draws up to 6 weeks after vaccination.

Massive increase in visual range preceded the origin of terrestrial vertebrates.

Abstract:

 The evolution of terrestrial vertebrates, starting around 385 million years ago, is an iconic moment in evolution that brings to mind images of fish transforming into four-legged animals. Here, we show that this radical change in body shape was preceded by an equally dramatic change in sensory abilities akin to transitioning from seeing over short distances in a dense fog to seeing over long distances on a clear day. Measurements of eye sockets and simulations of their evolution show that eyes nearly tripled in size just before vertebrates began living on land. Computational simulations of these animals visual ecology show that for viewing objects through water, the increase in eye size provided a negligible increase in performance. However, when viewing objects through air, the increase in eye size provided a large increase in performance. The jump in eye size was, therefore, unlikely to have arisen for seeing through water and instead points to an unexpected hybrid of seeing through air while still primarily inhabiting water. Our results and several anatomical innovations arising at the same time suggest lifestyle similarity to crocodiles. The consequent combination of the increase in eye size and vision through air would have conferred a 1 million-fold increase in the amount of space within which objects could be seen. The buena vista hypothesis that our data suggest is that seeing opportunities from afar played a role in the subsequent evolution of fully terrestrial limbs as well as the emergence of elaborated action sequences through planning circuits in the nervous system. </TEXT>

Public Awareness of and Contact With Physicians Who Receive Industry Payments: A National Survey. 

Genevieve Pham-Kanter, Michelle M. Mello, Lisa Soleymani Lehmann, Eric G. Campbell, Daniel Carpenter. 

Journal of General Internal Medicine, 2017; 

First Online: 06 March 2017

DOI: 10.1007/s11606-017-4012-3

Abstract:

 Background

 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, part of the Affordable Care Act, requires pharmaceutical and medical device firms to report payments they make to physicians and, through its Open Payments program, makes this information publicly available.

 Objective

 To establish estimates of the exposure of the American patient population to physicians who accept industry payments, to compare these population-based estimates to physician-based estimates of industry contact, and to investigate Americans awareness of industry payments.

 Design

 Cross-sectional survey conducted in late September and early October 2014, with data linkage of respondents physicians to Open Payments data.

 Participants

 A total of 3542 adults drawn from a large, nationally representative household panel.

 Main Measures

 Respondents contact with physicians reported in Open Payments to have received industry payments; respondents awareness that physicians receive payments from industry and that payment information is publicly available; respondents knowledge of whether their own physician received industry payments.

 Key Results

 Among the 1987 respondents who could be matched to a specific physician, 65% saw a physician who had received an industry payment during the previous 12 months. This population-based estimate of exposure to industry contact is much higher than physician-based estimates from the same period, which indicate that 41% of physicians received an industry payment. Across the six most frequently visited specialties, patient contact with physicians who had received an industry payment ranged from 60 to 85%; the percentage of physicians with industry contact in these specialties was much lower (3556%). Only 12% of survey respondents knew that payment information was publicly available, and only 5% knew whether their own doctor had received payments.

 Conclusions

 Patients contact with physicians who receive industry payments is more prevalent than physician-based measures of industry contact would suggest. Very few Americans know whether their own doctor has received industry payments or are aware that payment information is publicly available. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Sexual behavior represents relatively common and mundane home-life behavior, with demonstrated impact on both mood and general physical and psychological well-being. Integrating emergent research on sex and mood with theory on work-life enrichment, we propose a novel model demonstrating the effects of sexual behavior at home on next-day job satisfaction and job engagement as a function of positive affect. Using a 2-week daily diary study of married, employed adults, we found that (a) when employees engaged in sex at home, they reported increased positive affect at work the following day, independent of the effects of marital satisfaction; (b) sex at home increased both daily job satisfaction and daily job engagement as a function of increased positive affect; and (c) daily work-to-family strain-based conflict significantly reduced the likelihood of engaging in sex at home that evening. Accordingly, we extend theory on work-life enrichment by demonstrating the import of seemingly banal behavior on daily work life, with implications for work-life impingement. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 The limited number of known low-band-gap photoelectrocatalytic materials poses a significant challenge for the generation of chemical fuels from sunlight. Using high-throughput ab initio theory with experiments in an integrated workflow, we find eight ternary vanadate oxide photoanodes in the target band-gap range (1.22.8 eV). Detailed analysis of these vanadate compounds reveals the key role of VO4 structural motifs and electronic band-edge character in efficient photoanodes, initiating a genome for such materials and paving the way for a broadly applicable high-throughput-discovery and materials-by-design feedback loop. Considerably expanding the number of known photoelectrocatalysts for water oxidation, our study establishes ternary metal vanadates as a prolific class of photoanode materials for generation of chemical fuels from sunlight and demonstrates our high-throughput theoryexperiment pipeline as a prolific approach to materials discovery. </TEXT>

Advanced oil sorbents using sequential infiltration synthesis

Edward Barry, Anil U. Mane, Joseph A. Libera, Jeffrey W. Elam and Seth B. Darling

J. Mater. Chem. A, 2017,5, 2929-2935

Abstract:

 Disasters on the scale of the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon serve as harrowing reminders of the devastating effects uncontrolled oil spills have on the environment. Skimming, burning, and dispersing oil are only partially effective and carry their own ecological impacts. An enticing alternative strategy involves oil sorbents capable of efficient extraction of oil from water bodies, which in turn necessitates the design and implementation of novel materials Here, we extend methods of sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) traditionally only applied to nanometer scale thin films to create oil sorbents based on macroscopic, commercially available polymeric foams. Targeting superoleophilic and superhydrophobic chemistries, we demonstrate the propensity of SIS-based modifications in oil spill remediation and demonstrate its efficacy in crude oil sorption in model seawater. We find crude oil sorption on the order of 30 and 90 times the initial foam weight for polyurethane and polyimide, respectively, both with highly favorable reusability. </TEXT>

Sex Differences in Microglia Activity within the Periaqueductal Gray of the Rat: A Potential Mechanism Driving the Dimorphic Effects of Morphine

H.H. Doyle, L.N. Eidson, D.M. Sinkiewicz and A.Z. Murphy

Journal of Neuroscience 20 February 2017, 2906-16; 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2906-16.2017

Abstract:

 Although morphine remains the primary drug prescribed for alleviation of severe or persistent pain, both preclinical and clinical studies have shown that females require 2-3 times more morphine than males to produce comparable levels of analgesia. In addition to binding to the neuronal  opioid receptor (MOR), morphine binds to the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) localized primarily on microglia. Morphine action at TLR4 initiates a neuroinflammatory response that directly opposes the analgesic effects of morphine. Here we test the hypothesis that the attenuated response to morphine observed in females is the result of increased microglia activation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a central locus mediating the antinociceptive effects of morphine. We report that while no overall sex differences in the density of microglia were noted within the PAG of male or female rats, microglia exhibited a more activated phenotype in females at baseline, with the degree of activation a significant predictor of morphine ED50 values. Priming microglia with LPS induced greater microglia activation in the PAG of females compared with males that was accompanied by increased transcription levels of IL-1 and a significant rightward shift in the morphine dose response curve. Blockade of morphine binding to PAG TLR4 with (+)-naloxone significantly potentiated morphine antinociception in females such that no sex differences in ED50 were observed. These results demonstrate that PAG microglia are sexually dimorphic in both basal and LPS-induced activation, and contribute to the sexually dimorphic effects of morphine in the rat. </TEXT>

When I come across interesting and relevant articles on a topic related to a sub, I will post it as it may be of interest to other Redditors. I have posted articles about other political parties on both sides of the political spectrum and from other countries too. It just so happens that Trump is particularly newsworthy at the moment, hence the inordinate number of articles being posted about him. I don't have a particular agenda and I'm not part of a coordinated posting group if you're wondering. Hope this clears your query up.  </TEXT>

Improving late life depression and cognitive control through the use of therapeutic video game technology: A proof-of-concept randomized trial

Joaquin A. Anguera1,2,*, Faith M. Gunning3 andPatricia A. Aren4,*

Depression and Anxiety, 00, 110.

DOI: 10.1002/da.22588

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/da.22588/abstract

Abstract:

 Background

 Existing treatments for depression are known to have only modest effects, are insufficiently targeted, and are inconsistently utilized, particularly in older adults. Indeed, older adults with impaired cognitive control networks tend to demonstrate poor response to a majority of existing depression interventions. Cognitive control interventions delivered using entertainment software have the potential to not only target the underlying cerebral dysfunction associated with depression, but to do so in a manner that is engaging and engenders adherence to treatment protocol.

 Methods

 In this proof-of-concept trial (Clinicaltrials.gov #: NCT02229188), individuals with late life depression (LLD) (22; 60+ years old) were randomized to either problem solving therapy (PST, n = 10) or a neurobiologically inspired digital platform designed to enhance cognitive control faculties (Project: EVO, n = 12). Given the overlapping functional neuroanatomy of mood disturbances and executive dysfunction, we explored the impact of an intervention targeting cognitive control abilities, functional disability, and mood in older adults suffering from LLD, and how those outcomes compare to a therapeutic gold standard.

 Results

 EVO participants demonstrated similar improvements in mood and self-reported function after 4 weeks of treatment to PST participants. The EVO participants also showed generalization to untrained measures of working memory and attention, as well as negativity bias, a finding not evident in the PST condition. Individuals assigned to EVO demonstrated 100% adherence.

 Conclusions

 This study provides preliminary findings that this therapeutic video game targeting cognitive control deficits may be an efficacious LLD intervention. Future research is needed to confirm these findings. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of remote nonpainful electrical upper arm skin stimulation in reducing migraine attack pain.

 Methods: This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, crossover, sham-controlled trial. Migraineurs applied skin electrodes to the upper arm soon after attack onset for 20 minutes, at various pulse widths, and refrained from medications for 2 hours. Patients were asked to use the device for up to 20 attacks.

 Results: In 71 patients (299 treatments) with evaluable data, 50% pain reduction was obtained for 64% of participants based on best of 200-s, 150-s, and 100-s pulse width stimuli per individual vs 26% for sham stimuli. Greater pain reduction was found for active stimulation vs placebo; for those starting at severe or moderate pain, reduction (1) to mild or no pain occurred in 58% (25/43) of participants (66/134 treatments) for the 200-s stimulation protocol and 24% (4/17; 8/29 treatments) for placebo (p = 0.02), and (2) to no pain occurred in 30% (13/43) of participants (37/134 treatments) and 6% (1/17; 5/29 treatments), respectively (p = 0.004). Earlier application of the treatment, within 20 minutes of attack onset, yielded better results: 46.7% pain reduction as opposed to 24.9% reduction when started later (p = 0.02).

 Conclusion: Nonpainful remote skin stimulation can significantly reduce migraine pain, especially when applied early in an attack. This is presumably by activating descending inhibition pathways via the conditioned pain modulation effect. This treatment may be proposed as an attractive nonpharmacologic, easy to use, adverse event free, and inexpensive tool to reduce migraine pain. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of remote nonpainful electrical upper arm skin stimulation in reducing migraine attack pain.

 Methods: This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, crossover, sham-controlled trial. Migraineurs applied skin electrodes to the upper arm soon after attack onset for 20 minutes, at various pulse widths, and refrained from medications for 2 hours. Patients were asked to use the device for up to 20 attacks.

 Results: In 71 patients (299 treatments) with evaluable data, 50% pain reduction was obtained for 64% of participants based on best of 200-s, 150-s, and 100-s pulse width stimuli per individual vs 26% for sham stimuli. Greater pain reduction was found for active stimulation vs placebo; for those starting at severe or moderate pain, reduction (1) to mild or no pain occurred in 58% (25/43) of participants (66/134 treatments) for the 200-s stimulation protocol and 24% (4/17; 8/29 treatments) for placebo (p = 0.02), and (2) to no pain occurred in 30% (13/43) of participants (37/134 treatments) and 6% (1/17; 5/29 treatments), respectively (p = 0.004). Earlier application of the treatment, within 20 minutes of attack onset, yielded better results: 46.7% pain reduction as opposed to 24.9% reduction when started later (p = 0.02).

 Conclusion: Nonpainful remote skin stimulation can significantly reduce migraine pain, especially when applied early in an attack.

Poor replication validity of biomedical association studies reported by newspapers

Estelle Dumas-Mallet ,Andy Smith, Thomas Boraud, Franois Gonon

Abstract:

 Objective

 To investigate the replication validity of biomedical association studies covered by newspapers.

 Methods

 We used a database of 4723 primary studies included in 306 meta-analysis articles. These studies associated a risk factor with a disease in three biomedical domains, psychiatry, neurology and four somatic diseases. They were classified into a lifestyle category (e.g. smoking) and a non-lifestyle category (e.g. genetic risk). Using the database Dow Jones Factiva, we investigated the newspaper coverage of each study. Their replication validity was assessed using a comparison with their corresponding meta-analyses.

 Results

 Among the 5029 articles of our database, 156 primary studies (of which 63 were lifestyle studies) and 5 meta-analysis articles were reported in 1561 newspaper articles. The percentage of covered studies and the number of newspaper articles per study strongly increased with the impact factor of the journal that published each scientific study. Newspapers almost equally covered initial (5/39 12.8%) and subsequent (58/600 9.7%) lifestyle studies. In contrast, initial non-lifestyle studies were covered more often (48/366 13.1%) than subsequent ones (45/3718 1.2%). Newspapers never covered initial studies reporting null findings and rarely reported subsequent null observations. Only 48.7% of the 156 studies reported by newspapers were confirmed by the corresponding meta-analyses. Initial non-lifestyle studies were less often confirmed (16/48) than subsequent ones (29/45) and than lifestyle studies (31/63). Psychiatric studies covered by newspapers were less often confirmed (10/38) than the neurological (26/41) or somatic (40/77) ones. This is correlated to an even larger coverage of initial studies in psychiatry. Whereas 234 newspaper articles covered the 35 initial studies that were later disconfirmed, only four press articles covered a subsequent null finding and mentioned the refutation of an initial claim.

 Conclusion

 Journalists preferentially cover initial findings although they are often contradicted by meta-analyses and rarely inform the public when they are disconfirmed. </TEXT>

Protection against fine particle-induced pulmonary and systemic inflammation by omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids

Xiang-Yong LiLei HaoYing-Hua LiuChih-Yu ChenVictor J. PaiJing X. Kang

Full text link:

Abstract

 Background

 Exposure to fine particulate matter, such as through air pollution, has been linked to the increased incidence of chronic diseases. However, few measures have been taken to reduce the health risks associated with fine particle exposure. The identification of safe and effective methods to protect against fine particle exposure-related damage is urgently needed.

 Methods

 We used synthetic, non-toxic, fluorescent fine particles to investigate the physical distribution of inhaled fine particles and their effects on pulmonary and systemic inflammation in mice. Tissue levels of omega-3 fatty acids were elevated via dietary supplementation or the fat-1 transgenic mouse model. Markers of pulmonary and systemic inflammation were assessed.

 Results

 We discovered that fine particulate matter not only accumulates in the lungs but can also penetrate the pulmonary barrier and travel into other organs, including the brain, liver, spleen, kidney, and testis. These particles induced both pulmonary and systemic inflammation and increased oxidative stress. We also show that elevating tissue levels of omega-3 fatty acids was effective in reducing fine particle-induced inflammation, whether as a preventive method (prior to exposure) or as an intervention (after exposure).

 Conclusions

 These results advance our understanding of how fine particles contribute to disease development and suggest that increasing tissue omega-3 levels may be a promising nutritional means for reducing the risk of diseases induced by particle exposure. </TEXT>

Emergence of function from coordinated cells in a tissue

Indika Rajapakse, Stephen Smale.

Significance

 A basic problem in biology is understanding how information from a single genome gives rise to function in a mature multicellular tissue. Genome dynamics stabilize to give rise to a protein distribution in a given cell type, which in turn gives rise to the identity of a cell. We build a highly idealized mathematical foundation that combines the genome (within cell) and the diffusion (between cell) dynamical forces. The trade-off between these forces gives rise to the emergence of function. We define emergence as the coordinated effect of individual components that establishes an objective not possible for an individual component. Our setting of emergence may further our understanding of normal tissue function and dysfunctional states such as cancer.

Abstract

 This work presents a mathematical study of tissue dynamics. We combine within-cell genome dynamics and diffusion between cells, so that the synthesis of the two gives rise to the emergence of function, akin to establishing tissue homeostasis. We introduce two concepts, monotonicity and a weak version of hardwiring. 

 These together are sufficient for global convergence of the tissue dynamics.

 Is there a basis for emergence of tissue-specific function? Emergence in this work is defined as the coordinated effect of individual components that establishes an objective not possible for an individual component. Our components are cells with their proteins, and the objective is the function of a tissue. Here tissue is a set of cells of the same cell type located together as exemplified by an organ in the body. In vertebrates, consider the liver, functioning to detoxify and ensure an appropriate composition of blood, and the skeletal muscle, functioning to contract and generate force. In each of these tissues millions of individual cells contribute to emergence of function according to their cell type. The main elements of emergence that we consider are first, the protein distribution in a given cell type and second, the cellular architecture of the tissue, a 3D structure with diffusion of molecules between cells. We build a mathematical model for emergence of function, from a large accumulation of data. We also use our previous work on cell dynamics (genome dynamics) and the work of Alan Turing on diffusion (1).

 Underlying our setting are widely believed biological hypotheses: (i) Cells within a tissue (i.e., the same cell type) have the same dynamics and the same distribution of proteins at equilibrium and (ii) the function of a cell corresponds to the proteins of that cell. For reasons that will be discussed, we call the property in i hardwiring of the tissue (2, 3). Convergence of the tissue dynamics to such an equilibrium naturally takes on importance, for its role in maintenance of tissue function (4). Even a local stability of the (hardwiring) equilibrium, i.e., its robustness, gives some validity to our model in biology. Our main theorem (Theorem 5) establishes that monotonicity, a property that we introduce here, implies global convergence of the tissue dynamics to the equilibrium, where all cells have the same protein distribution. This gives a biological justification for our framework and a model for emergence of function, as well as suggestions for studying the passage from emergence to morphogenesis. On the other hand one could see the emergence described here as a final stage of morphogenesis, completing a cycle.

 Our model could give some support to obtaining more insights. Further questions, where quantitative support is expected, are also suggested: (i) To what extent is there a common equilibrium of proteins in each cell in a tissue? (ii) How do cells in a tissue cooperate to give rise to function? And (iii) how do we measure the diffusion between the cells? </TEXT>

Depression among current, former, and never smokers from 2005 to 2013: The hidden role of disparities in depression in the ongoing tobacco epidemic

Renee D. Goodwin, Melanie M. Wall, Lorra Garey, Michael J. Zvolensky, Lisa Dierker, Sandro Galea, Misato Gbedemah, Andrea H. Weinberger, Jill M. Williams, Mei-Chen Hu, Deborah S. Hasin

Published Online: January 13, 2017

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.11.038

Highlights

Depression is persistently twice as common among current smokers, compared with former and never smokers from 20052013.
Depression has not significantly increased among current smokers overall from 20052013.
Depression has increased significantly among demographic subgroups of current smokers.
Depression increased most prominently among young, male and high-income daily smokers.

Background

After declining sharply for many years, the prevalence of smoking has remained fairly stable over the past decade. One possible explanation is that there has been an increase in the prevalence of barriers to cessation, like depression, among remaining smokers.

Objectives

To estimate changes in the prevalence of depression among current, former and never smokers in the United States (U.S.) population from 2005 to 2013 overall and by age, gender, and income.

Methods

Data were drawn from the National Household Survey on Drug Use (NSDUH), an annual cross-sectional study of persons ages 12 and over (N=496,805). The prevalence of past 12-month depression was examined annually among current (past 12-month), former (not past 12-month), and lifetime non-smokers from 2005 to 2013. Data were re-analyzed stratified by age, gender, and household income, and adjusted for demographics.

Results

Depression appears to have significantly increased in the United States from 2005 to 2013 among current, former, and never smokers. Depression prevalence increased among current smokers overall, but the increase among former and never smokers was even more prominent. Striking temporal changes emerged by age, gender and income. Specifically, (1) depression increased significantly among current smokers aged 1217 (from 16% to 22%, p-value=0.0002) and the prevalence was consistently more than twice as high as that of never smokers; (2) depression increased among male smokers (6.19%7.82%, p-value=0.0099); (3) depression increased significantly among smokers in the highest income group (6.36% to 8.91%, p-value=0.0400). Throughout this period, the prevalence of depression among current smokers was consistently twice as high as among former and never smokers.

Discussion

Public health efforts aimed at decreasing the prevalence of smoking should take depression into account, a common and modifiable barrier whose treatment may help to increase successful smoking cessation. Future work is needed to disentangle the role of smoking and other factors that lead to increases in depression in the US population.

Abstract:

 Although morphine remains the primary drug prescribed for alleviation of severe or persistent pain, both preclinical and clinical studies have shown that females require 2-3 times more morphine than males to produce comparable levels of analgesia. In addition to binding to the neuronal  opioid receptor (MOR), morphine binds to the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) localized primarily on microglia. Morphine action at TLR4 initiates a neuroinflammatory response that directly opposes the analgesic effects of morphine. Here we test the hypothesis that the attenuated response to morphine observed in females is the result of increased microglia activation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a central locus mediating the antinociceptive effects of morphine. We report that while no overall sex differences in the density of microglia were noted within the PAG of male or female rats, microglia exhibited a more activated phenotype in females at baseline, with the degree of activation a significant predictor of morphine ED50 values. Priming microglia with LPS induced greater microglia activation in the PAG of females compared with males that was accompanied by increased transcription levels of IL-1 and a significant rightward shift in the morphine dose response curve. Blockade of morphine binding to PAG TLR4 with (+)-naloxone significantly potentiated morphine antinociception in females such that no sex differences in ED50 were observed. These results demonstrate that PAG microglia are sexually dimorphic in both basal and LPS-induced activation, and contribute to the sexually dimorphic effects of morphine in the rat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi

Thanks for helping out with this AMA. This is a very interesting topic indeed!

I have two questions:

1. What has been the most unusual case your team has had to solve? 

2. What is the role of artificial intelligence in this space? I am aware that IBM Watson has just been launched in Germany in a similar area of unknown diseases with apparently some success. Are there plans for your team to do something similar?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Abstract

 A megaslump at Batagaika, in northern Yakutia, exposes a remarkable stratigraphic sequence of permafrost deposits ~5080 m thick. To determine their potential for answering key questions about Quaternary environmental and climatic change in northeast Siberia, we carried out a reconnaissance study of their cryostratigraphy and paleoecology, supported by four rangefinder 14C ages. The sequence includes two ice complexes separated by a unit of fine sand containing narrow syngenetic ice wedges and multiple paleosols. Overall, the sequence developed as permafrost grew syngenetically through an eolian sand sheet aggrading on a hillslope. Wood remains occur in two forest beds, each associated with a reddened weathering horizon. The lower bed contains high amounts of Larix pollen (20%), plus small amounts of Picea and Pinus pumila, and is attributed to interglacial conditions. Pollen from the overlying sequence is dominated by herbaceous taxa (~70%80%) attributed to an open tundra landscape during interstadial climatic conditions. Of three hypothetical age schemes considered, we tentatively attribute much of the Batagaika sequence to Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The upper and lower forest beds may represent a midMIS 3 optimum and MIS 5, respectively, although we cannot discount alternative attributions to MIS 5 and 7. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker is the quintessential game of imperfect information, and a longstanding challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated with statistical significance professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas holdem. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce more difficult to exploit strategies than prior approaches. </TEXT>

Probiotics (Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13, Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1, and Bifidobacterium longum MM-2) improve rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life in individuals with seasonal allergies: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial

First published February 22, 2017

Abstract

 Background: Rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life is often reduced during seasonal allergies. The Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MRQLQ) is a validated tool used to measure quality of life in people experiencing allergies (0 = not troubled to 6 = extremely troubled). Probiotics may improve quality of life during allergy season by increasing the percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inducing tolerance.

 Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether consuming Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13, Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1, and B. longum MM-2 compared with placebo would result in beneficial effects on MRQLQ scores throughout allergy season in individuals who typically experience seasonal allergies. Secondary outcomes included changes in immune markers as part of a potential mechanism for changes in MRQLQ scores.

 Design: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomized clinical trial, 173 participants (mean  SEM: age 27  1 y) who self-identified as having seasonal allergies received either a probiotic (2 capsules/d, 1.5 billion colony-forming units/capsule) or placebo during spring allergy season for 8 wk. MRQLQ scores were collected weekly throughout the study. Fasting blood samples were taken from a subgroup (placebo, n = 37; probiotic, n = 35) at baseline and week 6 (predicted peak of pollen) to determine serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E concentrations and Treg percentages.

 Results: The probiotic group reported an improvement in the MRQLQ global score from baseline to pollen peak (0.68  0.13) when compared with the placebo group (0.19  0.14; P = 0.0092). Both serum total IgE and the percentage of Tregs increased from baseline to week 6, but changes were not different between groups.

 Conclusions: This combination probiotic improved rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life during allergy season for healthy individuals with self-reported seasonal allergies; however, the associated mechanism is still unclear. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02349711. </TEXT>

Adiposity and cancer at major anatomical sites: umbrella review of the literature

BMJ 2017; 356 

doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j477 

(Published 28 February 2017)

Abstract:

 Objective To evaluate the strength and validity of the evidence for the association between adiposity and risk of developing or dying from cancer.

 Design Umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

 Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and manual screening of retrieved references.

 Eligibility criteria Systematic reviews or meta-analyses of observational studies that evaluated the association between indices of adiposity and risk of developing or dying from cancer.

 Data synthesis Primary analysis focused on cohort studies exploring associations for continuous measures of adiposity. The evidence was graded into strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, or weak after applying criteria that included the statistical significance of the random effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of cancer cases, heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction intervals, small study effects, excess significance bias, and sensitivity analysis with credibility ceilings.

 Results 204 meta-analyses investigated associations between seven indices of adiposity and developing or dying from 36 primary cancers and their subtypes. Of the 95 meta-analyses that included cohort studies and used a continuous scale to measure adiposity, only 12 (13%) associations for nine cancers were supported by strong evidence. An increase in body mass index was associated with a higher risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma; colon and rectal cancer in men; biliary tract system and pancreatic cancer; endometrial cancer in premenopausal women; kidney cancer; and multiple myeloma. Weight gain and waist to hip circumference ratio were associated with higher risks of postmenopausal breast cancer in women who have never used hormone replacement therapy and endometrial cancer, respectively. The increase in the risk of developing cancer for every 5 kg/m2 increase in body mass index ranged from 9% (relative risk 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.13) for rectal cancer among men to 56% (1.56, 1.34 to 1.81) for biliary tract system cancer. The risk of postmenopausal breast cancer among women who have never used HRT increased by 11% for each 5 kg of weight gain in adulthood (1.11, 1.09 to 1.13), and the risk of endometrial cancer increased by 21% for each 0.1 increase in waist to hip ratio (1.21, 1.13 to 1.29). Five additional associations were supported by strong evidence when categorical measures of adiposity were included: weight gain with colorectal cancer; body mass index with gallbladder, gastric cardia, and ovarian cancer; and multiple myeloma mortality.

 Conclusions Although the association of adiposity with cancer risk has been extensively studied, associations for only 11 cancers (oesophageal adenocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the gastric cardia, colon, rectum, biliary tract system, pancreas, breast, endometrium, ovary, and kidney) were supported by strong evidence. Other associations could be genuine, but substantial uncertainty remains. Obesity is becoming one of the biggest problems in public health; evidence on the strength of the associated risks may allow finer selection of those at higher risk of cancer, who could be targeted for personalised prevention strategies. </TEXT>

Medical cannabis access, use, and substitution for prescription opioids and other substances: A survey of authorized medical cannabis patients

Published Online: February 10, 2017

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2017.01.011

Link:
http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959(17)30013-0/abstract#/article/S0955-3959(17)30013-0/fulltext

Abstract

 Background

 In 2014 Health Canada replaced the Marihuana for Medical Access Regulations (MMAR) with the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR). One of the primary changes in the new program has been to move from a single Licensed Producer (LP) of cannabis to multiple Licensed Producers. This is the first comprehensive survey of patients enrolled in the MMPR.

 Methods

 Patients registered to purchase cannabis from Tilray, a federally authorized Licenced Producer (LP) within the MMPR, were invited to complete an online survey consisting of 107 questions on demographics, patterns of use, and cannabis substitution effect. The survey was completed by 271 respondents.

 Results

 Cannabis is perceived to be an effective treatment for diverse conditions, with pain and mental health the most prominent. Findings include high self-reported use of cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs (63%), particularly pharmaceutical opioids (30%), benzodiazepines (16%), and antidepressants (12%). Patients also reported substituting cannabis for alcohol (25%), cigarettes/tobacco (12%), and illicit drugs (3%). A significant percentage of patients (42%) reported accessing cannabis from illegal/unregulated sources in addition to access via LPs, and over half (55%) were charged to receive a medical recommendation to use cannabis, with nearly 25% paying $300 or more.

 Conclusion

 The finding that patients report its use as a substitute for prescription drugs supports prior research on medical cannabis users; however, this study is the first to specify the classes of prescription drugs for which cannabis it is used as a substitute, and to match this substitution to specific diagnostic categories. The findings that some authorized patients purchase cannabis from unregulated sources and that a significant percentage of patients were charged for medical cannabis recommendations highlight ongoing policy challenges for this federal program. </TEXT>

Of interest, from here:
http://news.ubc.ca/2015/03/16/universal-public-drug-coverage-would-save-canada-billions/

 Canada is the only developed country with a universal health care system that does not include prescription drug coverage.

Australia and the U.K. on the other hand provide a universal pharmaceutical funding system. So it clearly does work in the real world. In Australia which I am most familiar the system subsidizes the essential medicines. Which is in place in some form or another in most countries actually.  </TEXT>

Abstract:

 BACKGROUND: Canadas universal health care system does not include uni versal coverage of prescription drugs. We sought to estimate the effects of adding universal public coverage of an essential medicines list to existing pub lic drug plans in Canada.

 METHODS: We used administrative and market research data to estimate the 2015 shares of the volume and cost of prescriptions filled in the community setting that were for 117 drugs on a model list of essential medicines for Canada. We compared prices of these essential medicines in Canada with prices in the United States, Sweden and New Zealand. We estimated the cost of adding universal public drug coverage of these essential medicines based on anticipated effects on medication use and pricing.

 RESULTS: The 117 essential medicines on the model list accounted for 44% of all prescriptions and 30% of total prescription drug expenditures in 2015. Average prices of generic essential medicines were 47% lower in the US, 60% lower in Sweden and 84% lower in New Zealand; brandname drugs were priced 43% lower in the US. Esti mated savings from universal public coverage of these essential medicines was $4.27 billion per year (range $2.72 billion to $5.83 billion; 28% reduction) for patients and private drug plan sponsors, at an incremental government cost of $1.23 billion per year (range $373 million to $1.98 bil lion; 11% reduction).

 INTERPRETATION: Our analysis showed that adding universal public coverage of essential medicines to the existing pub lic drug plans in Canada could address most of Canadians pharmaceutical needs and save billions of dollars annu ally. Doing so may be a pragmatic step forward while more comprehensive pharmacare reforms are planned.

 Canada is the only developed country with a universal health care system that does not include prescription drug coverage.

Australia and the U.K. on the other hand provide a universal pharmaceutical funding system.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi

Thanks for agreeing to do this AMA!

As we learn more about the effects of simple sugars on our metabolism potentially leading to obesity and diabetes, and as governments consider increasing regulation and taxation, as well as restricting advertising, do you think that sugar will one day become the new "smoking", and be ultimately relegated to something seen as unhealthy and stigmatized, that only a minority of people partake in? Or will we always enjoy our desserts and sweets?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to restore communication for people with tetraplegia and anarthria by translating neural activity into control signals for assistive communication devices. While previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated promising proofs-of-concept (Serruya et al., 2002; Simeral et al., 2011; Bacher et al., 2015; Nuyujukian et al., 2015; Aflalo et al., 2015; Gilja et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015; Wolpaw et al., 1998; Hwang et al., 2012; Spler et al., 2012; Leuthardt et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2002; Schalk et al., 2008; Moran, 2010; Brunner et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Townsend and Platsko, 2016; Vansteensel et al., 2016; Nuyujukian et al., 2016; Carmena et al., 2003; Musallam et al., 2004; Santhanam et al., 2006; Hochberg et al., 2006; Ganguly et al., 2011; ODoherty et al., 2011; Gilja et al., 2012), the performance of human clinical BCI systems is not yet high enough to support widespread adoption by people with physical limitations of speech. Here we report a high-performance intracortical BCI (iBCI) for communication, which was tested by three clinical trial participants with paralysis. The system leveraged advances in decoder design developed in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies (Gilja et al., 2015; Kao et al., 2016; Gilja et al., 2012). For all three participants, performance exceeded previous iBCIs (Bacher et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015) as measured by typing rate (by a factor of 1.44.2) and information throughput (by a factor of 2.24.0). This high level of performance demonstrates the potential utility of iBCIs as powerful assistive communication devices for people with limited motor function.
