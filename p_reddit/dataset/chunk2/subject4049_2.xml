	<TEXT> I think it takes 3 weeks of doing the same thing to become a habit. So I would say stay away from your old habits for 3 weeks while practicing your new things so they become habits. I usually do this, but I put reminders everywhere so that I remember to make a change in my habits.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is sleep paralysis. I believe it's when you're REM sleep is disturbed and your mind ends up being partly awake and asleep at the same time. Also, you're body goes into complete muscle atonia which prevents you from moving when you're dreaming, hence the paralysis. Since you're partly awake and asleep at the same time, dreams or nightmares play a part in real life to you. Most people believe when they're in sleep paralysis that there is an intruder in their house. The majority of the it's just your mind playing tricks on you....However, I wouldn't rule out any other reasons why this is happening to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happened a couple of years ago but one day I drove to my friends house after school. His mother opened up the door and greeted me, like usual, I said the usual things, "Hi how are you?" We talked for a little bit before I asked where my friend was and she said and I quote, "Probably either studying or fucking the next door neighbors daughter." I nervously laughed because she never talked like that to me and I said, "well can I just wait downstairs until he gets back?" And she just motioned to the downstairs. 1 hour later she asked if I  could come upstairs she had, "something for me to try" I came up and seen her half naked on the table with this weird lingerie on. She asked me if I was ever with an older women (I was 18 at the time) I didn't say a word and she pulled me over to her. We started to kiss and she started to undress.  At this point I felt nervous and scared and just really shocked this was happening. I ran out of the house w\o my things. I told my gf what happened and luckily she didnt break up with me. Also I got my things back after my friend brought them to school the next day. To this day I never stepped a foot in that house again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When Sai and Shin were born, instead of being given to their mothers they were taken away for "further examination" hours later they were presumed dead. (Note: they weren't born on the same day, this event happened on seperate dates but the same incident happened.) A organization (You decide name or pick name) took them in to run experiments. These experiments enhanced their ablities. (Mental and Physical) They were put with other boys who had the same experiments done to them. Now this story may seem a bit *much* but it's kind of hard to take their lives in Root and compare it to modern day tactics the U.S. would take to make combat machines. I hope this kinda helped, I wasn't sure where to start :). </TEXT>
