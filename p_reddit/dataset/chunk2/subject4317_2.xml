	<TEXT> My aunt always used to send me Alverde-kind of organic/natural drugstore brand but also really amazing and high quality for the price, and for something again natural and hands down one of the most high quality brands I know: Dr. Hauschka. And there's also a brand called Bebe-really young-girlish that I loved as a tween but they've got amazing foam cleanser and lipbalms. And almost forgot Herbacin Kamille hand creams, especially in the little pots are too cute and so amazing in the winter time!  </TEXT>
