	<TEXT> They're working on this literally right now in preparation for their new building system.

Seems like they have been working on that all the time.

you get a fcking "sphere test failed even when placing a foundation is completely possible

That's being fixed this upcoming update.

Then how come it's still happening? Couldn't build a decent entrance because of it.

I have read about it, I know what they are doing. But after almost half a year of not playing then coming back to the same old problems not being fixed yet can be irritating and give you the *why* face.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After half a year of not playing the game I finally got the urge to play again, and now I remember why I quit. The game is broken, literally. You can't make decent buildings without having to deal with the stability problem, you can't place pillars even when it's all blue color, you get a f*cking "sphere test failed even when placing a foundation is completely possible.
Before I quit I had a nice little cave base, was able to put everything everywhere when it came to building. Entrance was good shape and stable, could place a foundation literally anywhere in the cave. Good defense and good room for anything. Then an update arrived. The server restarted and generated a new map for all of us, found a new cave and started building. But guess what? We **couldn't.** Suddenly I couldn't place any foundations where it obviously were possible, normal walls couldn't be put down but I could put windows instead. Then I quit because I was pissed because I was screwed over again by the game for the last time.

Fast forward to present day, joined a server, looked far and wide for a cave and when I found one, I started building. But this time I was spammed by "sphere test failed" absolutely every time I tried to put down anything, even when it showed me it was possible. Gave up, made a rock house instead.
New house was good and stable, but for some idiotic, retarded reason the pillars were now in the middle of the foundation. I thought, ok I can maybe work with this. I built stairs on top of each other without a problem. Then the top stair broke. I used pillars to stabilize the entire house (because apparently you can put pillars normally when you get to 2nd floor) but for some reason the god damn stairs was at 7% stability. That's not the only thing, now I can't put down pillars. It's blue, it's able, but each time I put it down nothing happens. No pillar, no stability, but for some reason it steals my wood.

**Fix. This.**

TL;DR Game is so fucked up you can't build decent building anymore. Good fkn job on screwing your fanbase facepunch. -.-' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fixed various random cases where building placement could fail with a sphere test failed message even though the placement guide was shown as valid.

Bullshit. Tried soo many times to get this one foundation in place so I wouldn't have had to rebuild the entire base. Guess what facepunch, **it would not f*cking work.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This just blew my mind, it would actually help the prequels by not even remaking them or anything.
One thing though, Jar Jar must be ancient if he would show up in TFA. I mean he's young (**like** a 30 year old) in TPM and ages through the prequel movies. No idea how old gungans can be before they die but if they did this they would have to show him off as an old, week individual.(Like they did with Yoda) And because most of the SW fanbase probably don't know of this theory and would just hate it if he was too much in the movie.

One thing that I haven't noticed being mentioned is the fact that **Jar Jar had a relationship with the Queen of [Bardotta](http://www.starwars.com/databank/bardotta).** A world which the population is known for being force sensitive, and also has a dark side to it. This was shown of a couple of [episodes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3473254/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_10) in the clone wars series, so a little info on the world. The Jedi used to take force sensitive Bardottian children into their order, because of this Bardottians branded the Jedis as kidnappers. After that the Bardottians didn't want anything to do with the Jedi, but is that the **only** reason? So how the hell does Jar Jar just happen to be the bff of a force sensitive worlds queen? **This theory makes that believable.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How am I getting defensive? o.O Just pointed out that it wouldn't be a sequel. + the other live action remakes original animated film (man that's a mouthful) probably didn't get that great results at the box office either. But still, Treasure Planet is amazing even if it did bomb. Also if a movie bombs is it automatically bad? PotC On Stranger Tides was terrible but still made above one billion world wide and it still gets a sequel. TP is the other way around on that bit tho </TEXT>
