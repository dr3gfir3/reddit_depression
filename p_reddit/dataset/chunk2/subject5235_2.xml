	<TEXT> Hi! First off, thank you so much!! I don't really know what I'm doing so I am so relieved that the terrain and rivers make sense for the most part and that the colors are working well. I hand drew everything originally, and then scanned it and colored it with photoshop. It's a very large drawing (3 feet x 6 feet), which I why I don't have a complete scanned/colored world yet. 

I haven't heard of Fabled Lands-- I suppose I draw much of my inspiration from Tolkien's works, as well as the coastlines of my native Northern California. 

The constellations actually hint at how the inhabitants of this world try to make sense of it. The northern and southern poles are too cold, mountainous, and dark for anyone to explore and no one has really been there, so most people assume that the planet just slopes up into space.

Thank you very, very much for the suggestions, too! I suppose I wanted the Luarm Sea to act as some type of Mediterranean environment but I might experiment with the overall shape and how it relates to Zargoza Bay. I'll definitely do some research and look at older maps. I never really thought of how a native cartographer would refer to places in this world--very useful suggestion. 

All in all THANK YOU SO MUCH for the help and encouragement. I'll be sure to put up some updates in the future! </TEXT>
