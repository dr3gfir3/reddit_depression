	<TITLE> Pilot episode of my new Podcast: "The Morning Report" A short science fiction podcast that takes place within the underbelly of Area 51. Looking for advice/critique! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-12 01:27:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking for critique and advice on how to proceed with this podcast.  So far, it only exists on Youtube, but I'm working on getting a RSS feed and putting it up on iTunes and other platforms.  I'm also looking to build a website for the podcast, and I've been looking at Squarespace (A site which every podcaster seems to advertise.) to build up from.  I'd like to know if that site is workable for updating podcasts, if there's an easy way to set up a way to download episodes, etc.

[Here is the actual episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z35Z7qvmW2c)

There's cursing, so it may be NSFW.

Basically, the show is about a radio host that works as human relations/radio within Area 51.  He gives the announcements, lunch menu, etc, and then tells a story about a declassified file.  It gets paranormal, spooky, comical from there.  It's kind of like a X-Files/Twilight Zone 'story of the week' format, though I'm looking to update every two weeks to a month.

I'm also looking for critique on the following aspects of my podcast:

1. What did you like/dislike about the writing?
2. How's my voice acting?
3. How was the agent's voice acting?
4. Did the sound effects sound believable?
5. Did my mix down sound good? (I'm using Adobe Audition.  It's a learning process, but I like it a lot.)
6. How should I go about building an audience?  Are their sites fiction listeners would suggest?
7. How far into my podcast should I get before asking for donations?  I was thinking 5-6 episodes of steady releases.
8. What are some good links for copyright information?  Is there any concerns I should have with making a fiction podcast over a non-fiction/news/talk show?

This is my first podcast, and I'm excited but nervous about putting a fiction podcast out there.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A LOT of games that have come out recently have been released in a broken state. (Master Chief Collection, Assassin's Creed Unity, Evil Within) I think we should require a higher standard by not only the devs, but the stores that sell these games... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-20 08:03:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What I mean is this:

If you were to buy a movie, say...  From Wal-Mart.  You take it home, enjoy yourself, but near the end the movie it just stops.  No ending, no resolution...  Nothing.  It turns out that the people who made the movie and put it on DVD didn't make it right, so all the DVDs are permanently messed up like this.  They state that they'll have a replacement disk sent to those with the messed up movie, and that they can expect the movie to be in a 'better state' soon.

Only this doesn't happen with movies.  This NEVER happens because the people who put films on DVD usually have a certain standard to abide by.  This doesn't happen with any other product save Video Games.  With everything else, it is completely fine to recall a product when it doesn't work, but Video Games escape that loop hole.

Why?

And I know, Video Games are vastly different than films.  And you really can't stress test an online game like WoW without putting it out to everyone, but games like Unity, Halo, and Evil Within really have no excuse.

I think that's weird.  I feel if store chains, Gamestop, Wal-Mart, GAME, Best Buy, whatever...  Recalled Video Games for being broken messes, or even added a warning label to the game box, then we wouldn't have these issues like this.  Devs don't seem to be getting the hint that Gamers don't like getting broken products, but the average Joe who goes out and buys a game without researching it online make up for those complaints by buying it.  They see a jump in profit regardless, so there's no need to fix it.

If games that came out broken appeared with this label:
"WARNING: This game is in a unpolished state.  Upcoming patches may fix the current issues, but that is not guaranteed.  BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK"

I think the average Joe or parent buying a game for his/her child would stop and think about their purchase.  I guarantee devs and publishers would TAKE FUCKING NOTICE.

If store chains were held to a certain standard, a certain amount of rigorous testing of the game before it goes on shelves, I think we'd have stronger products with longer time spent on them to work out all the kinks.

Devs like Rockstar and Valve always take a TON of time on making their games.  And online problems aside, the usually deliver a solid product that manages to WORK on Day 1.  I know GTA V's online fiasco isn't quite a good example, but that falls into Online problems, which no one can really prepare for with the massive stress that a real multiplayer community would give the game.  Regardless, they should be the standard to strive to.

A lot of people put blame on the publishers, and yeah they are to blame for pushing out a unfinished product, but I think retailers can really help the video game community by being stricter on what kind of game is pushed out.  They wouldn't suffer for it either.  Best Buy will keep selling TVs and Washing machines.  Wal-Mart sells food for Christ's sake.  The ONLY people I think who could suffer is the video game stores.  But hell, Gamestop has been monopolizing the market for far too long...  So I wouldn't feel too bad about it if they lost some profit.

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Using a credit card to pay off student loans... Good idea or bad idea? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-16 20:06:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I work a number of jobs to pay off my loans.  Problem is, a lot of my freelance work comes in a bit randomly at times.  I can go a month without any work, or get a flurry of jobs within a matter of weeks.  Getting paid comes in randomly as well.  I work as a freelance editor, and sometimes payment can take 30-90 days. (I know, it sucks.) 

I have a number of student loans that I need to pay every month, and while I currently don't have a problem getting money, it's just getting the money at an appropriate time.  I am constantly late on my loans because my checks come in at the crappiest times.

I'm thinking that I could pay off the debt with a credit card, and then when my money comes in pay off the debt on the credit card.  I need to build a good bit of credit anyway.

Is this a good idea? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Recommendation)Bojack Horseman: A show with a shitty start that has one of the most heartbreaking season finales I've ever seen. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-02 10:40:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This show is hard to write about...

Bojack Horseman is an animated show about a washed out 90s TV star, a anthropomorphic horse, and his wacky cast of friends and lovers in his life.  He's trying to publish a memoir about his days before, during and after his stint on a family comedy about him as a single dad taking care of three human kids.

I'm writing this because the beginning of Bojack is bad.  Like, really bad.  It's obvious that this was pitched as a Netflix-exclusive Family Guy rip off, and it shows.  Break away jokes, 'remember the time when' jokes, unlikeable characters...  It all seethes with this aura of, Oh, I've seen this before...  I will admit, I didn't laugh much in Bojack.  I'm not sure if the writer's are very good at comedy, but I have to give a lot of credit to the background artists.  The strongest 'jokes' are the situational comedic moments of this being some kind of mad furry/human world in modern day LA.  In this LA, these anthro creatures are just part of life.  They've been a part of our culture and history, and I like all the subtle world building the show does through that.

But I wish something of you /r/animation.  I'd like for you to give Bojack Horseman a chance.  You have to suffer for a while, about five episodes, but that's when Bojack does a 180 and turns into something more...  Something different.  Bojack is hard to recommend.  My two roommates both watched it before me, and they turned it off in the middle of the first episode.  I didn't think much of it...  Just a failed show Netflix was trying out. (I think it was an attempt to compete against Hulu's The Awesomes.) Then I saw a thread on 4chan about it.  A 300+ post thread about how the show made them 'feel', rather than laugh.  I got curious...

I'm a big fan of a little unknown show on Adult Swim called Moral Orel.  Not many people watched it, and the people who have seem to think it was just a show picking on religion.  And it was, but Moral Orel took a chance and began to show wonderful set of ideas.  It subverted your expectations and did a 180, turning from a 'wacky comedy' to a dark drama about hate, alcoholism and neglect.  It was one of the biggest surprises in Animation, or TV, and I still don't understand why people don't talk about it more.  It doesn't even have a DVD release...  I feel like Bojack could be the next Moral Orel.  The next attempt for a TV show to take your expectations and scatter them.

I don't want to say much about the show.  The episodes past six are all very heart-straining and sad, watching as this Horse digs his hole deeper and deeper...  It's a hard show to recommend, but if you like having something metamorphosis into something at least somewhat interesting, then I give a high recommendation to Bojack.  Episode 11 has some fantastic visual story telling, and the finale moments of that episode really make you sink into your chair and feel like complete shit.  It's a feel bad show, but there are those of us out there that like to feel bad.

I want this show to have a second season.  I want the writers to realize they have something here, and that they should drop trying to be like other comedies.  Family Guy may sell well and be a money making product, but shows like Bojack and Moral Orel are trying to make ART.  We need more shows like this, even if it does take it a while to get good.

Also, for those who have watched it.  [Have some feels.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFLJFl7ws_0) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Feedback] First chapter of a Horror/Romance story. Tokyo Black (7,302 Words) [Explicit Content] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-12 23:43:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> https://docs.google.com/document/d/17sEYB_8-g-0mBndU2gnfbMAoaoq7pJHKLsIAuJ5-w3Q/edit

This is the first chapter of a horror/romance story set in Tokyo.  The first few chapters are setting up the characters and don't really touch on anything romantic, but there is some content here I'd like to run by /r/shutupandwrite to see if it works:

1. The Setting.  I have never been to Tokyo, but my story is a bit of a pulpy take on the city.  It takes place a few years in the future, so I feel I can take a few liberties with some of the elements of the city.  Nevertheless, this first chapter has little of Tokyo actually in it.  I still want to see how what I've written so far runs by those familiar with the area.

2. Show Don't Tell.  Seeing as how the monster is one of the main characters, I decided to do a mix of both showing and telling to explain her and her abilities to the audience through the dissection scene.  I don't know if this works, or if its explaining her too much too soon.  I'd appreciate thoughts on this scene.

3. 1st Person? I'm telling this story in the first person with the monster in the lead.  I know this will take some of the horror from the story, but I'm switching between two (Possibly 3-4) characters later in the story.  Still, I'd like to see if this chapter works on it's own in First Person.

4. I'm going to remove the bit about 'She has no matter!' seeing as how it's impossible.  I was trying to go for something Lovecraftian.

My goal is to make the reader uncomfortable with the story I'm writing, in both the romance and the gore.  But, I also want to capture a sweet romance with my lead characters as the story develops.  I can see comparisons to books like Twilight, but I'm trying to deconstruct that convention a bit.  This story would be about damaged, evil people as opposed to the shiny, love-stricken characters of books like Twilight.

Anyway, I'd appreciate any feedback!  Also, if any sentence structure comes off as wrong or weird, please let me know. </TEXT>

Its a pretty typical tutorial in terms of game play and explaining things to the player, but the excellent writing is what makes it stand out for me.

I'm also curious about what /r/games thinks of the NEED for tutorials in modern games.  Could we hypothetically just release a modern game, lets say a new GTA, without any instruction?  Could we rely on a player's curiosity and familiarity with previous games to carry them forward?

So, do you guys think writing is good or bad for devloping your writing ability? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Student Loans are seriously making my life difficult. Both Federal and Bank... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-08 17:48:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A lot of this can be put on me for not thinking ahead, but I seriously don't know what to do here.  I'm working as much as I can right now, and while I don't have a job for my degree's caliber, I feel like my two jobs should be able to pay these loans, but they can't.  I'm still finding myself late or completely out of money.

I have an art degree in a major I didn't really want due to unforeseen circumstances while I was going through school.  Its a long story, but the gist of it is the major I wanted to be in required internships that they didn't help you find, you had to pay tuition to the school to have them count, and that were required to graduate.  I ended up switching majors in the last year to something I could graduate in.  Its been a few years since I got out of school, and I'm constantly struggling to pay these loans.  

I work two jobs, one where I work most the week and make about 15 bucks an hour and another which is freelance, and erratic, that I make about 18 an hour.  I have a third job coming up as well, but that's freelance too.  And it sounds like it may not be worth it.

I have two loans total, one federal and one bank.  The bank loan compounds around 370 dollars a month while the federal, if I don't defer, is around 330.

That's 700 a month that I just don't have.  I can defer the federal loan for the third time, but that still doesn't help with the bank loan which won't let me defer unless I declare bankruptcy.

I really don't think it should be this hard for me to live a normal life after college, with or without well-paying job, but it seems like it is.

I don't really know what to do from here... 

Can I get some advice? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [NSFW] Researching for a novel I'm working on. I would love some info on Kabukich. I have some questions on the sex industry there as well... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-02 18:47:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently have been listening to Jake Adelstein's book 'Tokyo Vice' and its inspired me to work on a novel set in the areas of Kabukich.  Problem is I have never been there, and I don't have the income to go explore either.  So I'll have to make due with research.

Firstly, I understand that the Yakuza ran a good bit of that area in the 90s, and they had a big hand in tricking girls into the sex industry, even some foreigners,  but I'm really kind of curious about what influence the Yakuza has on the area in the modern age.

-What is the drug industry like in Tokyo?  A character I have thought up is a pot dealer who sells to foreigners in Kabukich and Akhibara.  How plausible would that be?

-Are the Shinseikai family pretty much top dogs, or is it all split up between multiple clans?  Who are the big clans in Kabukich? Are the Yamaguchi-gumi still present?

-I'm assuming gun laws in Japan are pretty strict, so it would be hard to find many Yakuza who are armed with guns.  Is that true though?

-I read in the book that Japan's prostitution laws in the 90s were really only enforced on those who were looking to do vaginal penetration.  Is that still the case?

-Have there been any strange or interesting themed sex clubs that have popped up with the popularity rise of anime/manga?

-What are the police like in Kabukich?  Corrupt?  Better?

-What changes are becoming present in these areas with women's rights growing more relevant in Japan?  I understand that Japan is in a sort of transitional stage with Women having less traditional roles.

-What role do women have in the Yakuza?  Are such roles changing?

I may think of more questions as I write.  I may edit them in or ask in the comments section.

Thanks for any help!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This may be quite the difficult question to answer, but I was wondering if there was any possible way that I could write a 'light novel', (A novella which is around 20,000 words.) and possibly market it to Japanese audiences?

I'm an American and I cannot speak Japanese, but I feel like I could write a series, (One that I've already been working on.) that would appeal to Japanese markets.  The only problem is the language barrier.  I cannot speak Japanese, but I'm not beyond hiring a translator.  Getting a manga illustration would be no problem.  I know plenty of artists I can pay to help me.

Would it be worth it?  Is it possible?  Anyone have any advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, if you didn't hear already, apparently when you pick up a new weapon in GTA V, no matter what kind of weapon it is, it will be permanently stored in your inventory even if you're arrested or killed.

This, in my opinion, sounds like it makes things way too easy.  I feel like there should at least be some options to where you can only hold one of each class of weapon, or even a hardcore mode where holding a large amount of weapons affects your running speed.  It'd be neat to give the character a bag to hold all his guns too.

Just my two cents... </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One trope I've noticed in anime is when certain characters, good guys and bad guys, have this sort of over-confidence in their abilities.  I don't mind a character having a little bit of swagger, but the idea of a MC being all haughty taughty because he made a plan 6 moves in advance that requires him to do very little to win just seems boring to me.

I want something where the action feels more dire.  A good example of this is Steins;Gate.  No one in that show knows what the hell is going on, and so it makes things much more dramatic when they're scrambling to meet their goals.

I just want some vulnerable characters...  Some that don't have this Sword Art Online over-powered nonsense. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yes, Steins;Gate is an anime, but its one of the most interesting anime programs I have seen in years.  So much so that I feel as if outsiders to anime could actually really enjoy this show.

The basic plot is that a bunch of nerds and freaks, the kind you'd see in IT Crowd or Freaks   Geeks, accidentally discover time travel.  If you've ever seen the film Primer it has a very similar idea and tone.  The show starts off as silly hijinks with the friends seeing what they can change by using their time machine, which allows them to send text messages into the past.  Eventually though, things get out of hand and it spirals from there.  I won't spoil much, but the show gets INTENSE.

Anime is hard to recommend to normal television audiences because there seems to be a selected audience for it as well as cultural differences that don't appeal to American audiences.  This show on the other hand, is amazing...  I feel that even with the typical anime tropes thrown in, people who've never opened up to anime before could actually really enjoy the show.

If you want to check it out, here's a link to the first episode:

(SUB) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsr-UiTPWsU

(DUB) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-L_sgaLUY

So please try and give the show a chance.  I'd recommend the subs over the dubbed version, seeing as how I think the VAs in the subbed version give better performances, but its up to you guys. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should GTA V ship with a 8 gig Flash Drive? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have an old-school xbox 360, and I don't know about you guys, but I can't remember the last time I had 8 gigs free on my HD.  I'm wondering if it would be a wise move for Rockstar to ship a Flash Drive with the game, maybe even custom made for it, so players who aren't informed don't have to drive out for one after they bought the game.

I have no problem buying one, but I have to admit that it might seem bad when 360 players realize they have to make a 8 gig install before they can play.  Shipping a flash drive with the Xbox version of the game could make that process much easier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did find it a bit interesting though...  This series is basically how a Bond Villain enlists his/her henchmen.  The entire series is basically Koko brainwashing the poor child to her way of thinking by subtly exposing him to more and more violence until her way of solving things makes sense.  But it makes me hate every character in the squad now, seeing as how they are all complacent with this obviously flawed plan that involves the deaths of 700,000 civilians.  And they're all so hopeful about it.  Like they're trying to convince the audience its for the greater good.

I also like how they shifted my perception from hating Kaspar to completely liking and respecting him.  Kaspar laughing in Koko's face about her plan was exactly what I was thinking... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Shinji might have been a clone in the new movie.  Here are a few details I noticed while watching:

-Never shown to be taken out of Unit 1.  For all we know, he may not have been in there.

-Being held inside the same containment unit that Asuka was held in after her body was presumably destroyed in 2.0.

-Asked a series of questions about facial recognition, what he last remembers, etc.

-Conveniently reawakened 14 years after 2.0, the age of Shinji at that time.

-Everyone is cold towards this Shinji, including Misato, who encouraged him to act against what was expected of him in 2.0.

-Shinji is told he has a 0% synchronization rate, yet is able to pilot an Eva later in the film. Is possibly being compensated by Kaworu.

-Shinji asks why Asuka is still so young to which she replies, "Curse of the LCL." That could mean a number of things. Isn't Rei required to be submerged in LCL to stay alive?

-DDS collar shown to either be ineffective or not even used when Misato has the trigger. If she really hates Shinji for the 3rd Impact, she would have detonated it. Pretty much implied that Misato couldn't have killed this Shinji even if she wanted to.  Plus it seems pretty stupid to hesitate when the world is so close to the brink.  It was set to trigger if the 4th impact happened. 

-Kaworu claims that the DDS collar was meant for him, implying that WILLE stole the collar from NERV.  Could they have stolen Shinji too?

-Shinji can inexplicably play piano with no prior training. Possibly planted inside him so that he would synch well with Kaworu.  You can't explain this by the Synch, because it took Shinji and Asuka a week to match togther PLAYING TWISTER.

-Kaworu seems confused by the 'duplicate' spears, seeing things as 'not right.' Most likely because this Shinji isn't the right Shinji.

	<TITLE> Grand Theft Auto V Hotseat anyone? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-19 10:23:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To explain what Hotseat is: Its basically passing the controller to someone on the couch with you.  Multiplayer gaming without multiple controllers.  The most recent example I can think of is the Hotseat mode in Civilization V where you take turns one person at a time.

I could see this working greatly in GTA V.  Three friends playing the game together, each given a specific character, and each making separate decisions outside of the other player's opinions.  I could see this working pretty easily in free roam, and then a goofy, hectic hot potato trade off during missions where 2-3 protagonists are in the level.

I could even see a hotseat mode, where players couldn't advance in the story until someone else has continued on with their respective character.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just got back from the theater, and frankly...   I do not understand why the score is so low.

When you compare this film to a film like Iron Man 3, Man of Steel is obviously the better movie, yet the disposition between their RT scores is almost baffling.  

Man of Steel was a really good movie.  Sure, it had it's flaws, but I really enjoyed the film.  And I know I'm not alone in thinking this.  Personally, most my friends enjoyed the movie.  All of my friends who love comics loved the movie.  On Rotten Tomatoes, there's an 82% of positive reviews for audience members.  The only people who didn't seem to like the movie are the critics.

Which brings up some obvious questions.  Why was there this gap between what general audiences thought and what the critics thought? </TEXT>

You'd spare thousands upon thousands of lives, but the steppe's would probably never be united and the country of Mongolia wouldn't be what it is today.  

It's an interesting topic to think about, because there's always the possibility of ruining future events with the ability to wipe someone from history.

And it brings up questions: There were obviously like-minded people like Hitler in Germany at the time.  Would killing him really stop World War 2 from happening?  Someone may just take his place.

So choose your answers with the thought process of what would happen after such a person was killed. </TEXT>

2. How does one get asked to go into a active war zone?  Do you immediately get in contact with a platoon or something to be imbedded with, or do you take a on-the-ground stance and look about for interesting stories?

3. What is the procedure if you find yourself in the hands of 'the enemy' or troops not on the side with the troops you are imbedded with?

4. Is there any temptation to pick up a gun and join the fight?

5. I have heard that many news organizations pick up stories from independent reporters out in the field.  How accurate is this, and do YOU approach them or do THEY approach you?

6. What is in your bag?  What equipment do you ALWAYS carry when out in a war zone?

7. When witnessing someone wounded or in need of help, is there a procedure NOT to interfere, or is it up to the reporter's discretion?

8. Who is better to work with, Fox or CNN?  Which pays better?

9. Any signs of PTSD when returning home?  Is there an itch to get 'back in the shit' like some armed personnel have?

10. Any tips for a freelance reporter wanting to do what YOU do? </TEXT>

It just locks the entire game up. BOSS sees no errors or conflicts, and I've already checked on the Frostfall site, and I have no mods that conflict with it.

I'm thinking its maybe another mod I have installed. I have one mod that distributes random items to NPCs, and I'm guessing maybe its cause I didn't craft the tent myself? I really don't know. Any ideas? </TEXT>
