	<TEXT> Two Stories:One where I'm the bad roommate, the other where I'm not.

Story One:
Freshman year of college my roommate and I were not friends but we didn't have any problems with eachother. I was a lazy bastard that hung out in the room and went to a few parties and came back drunk, while he triple majored and ran track. The worst thing he ever did was about once a week yell out directions to his house while he was asleep. One day, I thought he was going to be a track practice all afternoon and I figured it would be a good time for a wank. I had forgotten that the day before he specifically said that he was bringing his girlfriend over and asked that I make myself scarce. So, in he walks, with his girl, expecting me to be gone and instead I'm sitting there with headphones on watching terrible porn with my dick in my hand. Whoops. He was pissed. Super pissed. I hid in the library for the next 3 days. Later he said it wasn't a big deal but that I should stop jerkin' off so often. 

TLDR: I was a dick, with my dick.

Story Two:
I was in a suite with 6 other dudes. Most of us were at least acquaintances but in order to get this suite we needed to take in a random person. We had seen this guy at a few parties so we at least knew people that knew him. 
Turns out he was a raging alcoholic, that did an insane amount of coke, and would pick up non-english speaking people at bars and bring them back to the suite to have what sounded like loud painful sex. At first we thought he was gay because the second night we were there he brought back some hispanic dude that we recognized as a busboy from one of the local restaurants. No biggie. But then he brought back a girl the next night, then the next weekend 2 more dudes, and this went on throughout the semester. Once we threw a party and got a keg and we were about halfway through it one night and he shows up at about 1am with a cohort of dudes and gals that looked like they just fell off a Juggalo wagon. By 3am the rest of us were done but they were just getting started with lines of coke and drinking from the keg which he/they did not contribute to. Whatever, people are crazy.

One weekend towards the end of the semester we realized we hadn't seen him in about 5 days, but we were pretty sure he was still in his room because we'd hear Slayer blasting at random times of day/night and banging on the walls. Suddenly, at about 3pm on Sunday, 8 dudes and 1 girl come flowing out of his room and walk past us in the main room like its no big deal. The rest of us look at each other like...um wtf just happened? Then on of the dudes asks me if he can "borrow" my tv to watch a football game. In April. And this was not a flat screen, it was an old box tv that easily weighed 200lbs. I told him no and after a few "c'mons" I just said please leave and he calmly walked out. The roommate then comes out, half naked and looks like he just woke up from a 100 year sleep. We asked what was up with that and he didn't respond, turned and went back to his room. When we had to move out we went into his room and found piles of used condoms and random food containers, but nothing else besides the university owned furniture. 

TLDR: Pretty sure random roommate had coke binging orgies in our suite on the regular, and never invited any of us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was tied to a Callery Pear while being pelted with Bibles(of all kinds) by a Virgin Penis. When I passed out from the shame I did have a dream about Brad Pitt holding a wand, but my erection was gone by the time I woke up.

Where can I buy a vacuum, just in case.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The day that McDonlads sold cheeseburgers for 35 cents I went there during lunch and bought $20 worth. Armed with a bag of cheeseburgers I walked the halls that afternoon (and even into afterschool) selling each for $1. People seemed to like it and I made a decent amount of profit. I also ate like 10 burgers that day. Glorious.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How can I set up an online draft or auction? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-09 03:41:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I would like some advice building a custom draft/auction. Ideally there would be an draft component AND an auction component, but one or the other would be good enough.
Basically, it's like a fantasy football draft but with completely customization inputs such as players and point values. I'd like to run it live online for some friends and I. No real money would be exchanged, it would be for fake points and bragging rights. Any suggestions? I have limited technical knowledge but am tech savvy enough to potentially understand any jargon you may need to use. Any and all ideas are appreciated, thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was a doctor, internist I think but I don't remember. From the stories I've heard there was a "doctors" magazine, like surgeons monthly or american medical digest weekly or something, that had some high quality prints in every issue. They were collected over many many years and at some point he decided to make the collage. He and my grandmother were great appreciators of art but never had the money to really own anything too unique. They put their money into their children's education and occasionally splurged on some really radical furniture. Keep in mind this was the 50s/60s so nothing too crazy, but some of my fondest memories from my childhood are sitting at the teak table in the kitchen looking up at this amazing wall of amazing works while sharing some late night ice cream with my grandfather.

Thanks for pointing out the proper use of "classical" , "classic" , and "canonical." I'm learnding! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello r/arthistory! I have come to you for some help identifying what I understand are many "classical" pieces that are part of a collage my grandfather did in his kitchen. At this point the house has been destroyed but my fondest memory of his house was the kitchen and how the wall was decorated. I would like to reproduce it. Both for nostalgia and just to see if I can. So, I have an album of all of the pictures I took of the wall before the house was torn down. I would really appreciate any and all help identifying the pieces. Please just tell me what picture and in what area of the picture the piece you are identifying is. I wanted to make this its own post, and I still might, just to get attention. Obviously, the more eyes on this the more likely we can ID the whole thing. Thanks in advance. http://imgur.com/a/ZkA0M </TEXT>
