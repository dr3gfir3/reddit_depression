	<TITLE> I owe some of the greats of soul and R B a huge apology. Especially AL Green, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-11 02:20:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In my youth growing up in the 80's and 90's I thought I knew what good music was. I won"t embarrass myself by telling you what I thought( ahem.. Right Said Fred... ). At the time Al Green was that guy with Annie Lennox singing "Put a little love in your Heart" , Stevie Wonder was that blind guy who waved his head around and sang cheesy love songs and Marvin Gaye sang "Sexual Healing"  then was killed and then became famous because of those singing raisins. 
Last year I joined Spotify and I decided to look in to the history of modern music and my eyes were opened. For starters almost every rap song I loved growing up was sampled from a far superior 60's or 70's song. Even beats I thought were original turned out to be samples ( No diggitty I looking at you.) 
Al Green is remarkable talent with an amazing life story.
Marvin Gaye is my new favorite artist.  Fascinating life filled with ups and downs and the chemisty between Marvin and Tammi Terrell is something I wish I could have seen live in concert. Such A tragic end to promising career (research their history together it's worth it).
Stevie Wonder. I'm really sorry. I never took you seriously. I do now and I ask everyone to listen to his album Innervisions, it is the best single album of the era in my humble opinion. From beginning to end it really gives you feeling of what was happening at the time from a societal point of view.
Anyways with Spotify I am able to listen and discover many artist that i missed growing up. i only wish that I could go back in time and hear these artists in their prime. </TEXT>

 Gave a another female a key to her home for protection, threw a party to get people together,  noticed the kitchen and the bedspread were messy, frowned upon son living at home at 24, saw WTF then left the room and then returned instead of reacting immediately.
Individually these points mean nothing but all together = OP female.

P.S. my wife is awesome on the grill, I don't consider it a factor. </TEXT>
