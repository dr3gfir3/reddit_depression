	<TEXT> first up the list:  
combo 9    
celaphid illusionist 4  
nomads en-kor 4  
shaman en-kor 1  

kill 7  
narcomoeba 3  
angel of glory's rise 1  
azami, lady of scrolls 1  
labrotory maniac 1  
dread return 1  

protection 16    
force of will 4

aether vial 4  
mother of runes 2  

search 3  
recruiter of the guard 3  

cantrips 7  
brainstorm 4  
ponder 3   


lands 18  
cavern of souls 1  
hallowed fountain 2  
underground sea 2  
flooded  strand 4  
polluted delta 4  
island 1  
starlit sanctum 1  
plains 1  
scrubland 1   
karakas 1  

sideboard: 3 true-name, 2 phantasmal image,3 StP, 2 dark confidant,2 disenchant,
1 grand abolisher, 1 therapy, 1 Winter orb.

The combo is to assemble celephid illusionist plus an en-kor,mill your deck getting your narcos, then dread return angel of glory's rise and tap your lab man to azami  FTW.

This list is super raw, the numbers are all wrong, and the santcum shouldn't be there.

Round 1: infect  
Game 1  
My opponent mulls to five and cant find pump, disruption, or cantrips. I kill him turn 5 after brainstorm, ponder, ponder fetching away garbage the whole time, i finally recruit for nomad.
I board out teh combo 
Game 2  
i therapy and miss, my opponent has surgical for therapy and i don't force, so he gets the one in my hand and sees how i boarded. i swords his inkmoth on turn 3 and my opponent draws like garbage. he trys to kill me with noble hierarch, but swords daze force blue card are having none of that. my board when the game ends is double true name vial, some lands. 

round 2 burn  
Game 1  
opponent mulls to five, i kill turn three.

keep the combo in the deck, board daze for therapy
Game 2   
I draw 1 land all game, fortunately daze and force hold down the fort while i get vials to 2 and 3, killing my opponent on turn 5.
my opponent drew like garbage, five lands is not where you want to be in burn.

round 3 D T  
Game 1   
he doesn't leave up any interaction against my fetch island vial start, then dies to cavern into squid wizard, vial in nomad, kill you. He had StP in hand.

Game 2
Board out the combo,force of will, 2 daze. Board in all fifteen cards.

This one is a bit of a grind, but my answers matched up and I ended the game with true name copied by phantasmal image and nomads en-kor to infinity block.

Round 4 White Eldrazi    
Game 1  
He plays Warping Wail on my nomad then follows up with  big Thalia. then he procees to brick so i can play  karakas and my combo. dead turn 5.

Board: Get that combo out of there
Game 2
He plays thalia and rest in peace that i dont care about, wastes me a little, resolves chalice at one, then draws land for three turns. Meanwhile my board becomes true-name true- name, image copy true name, recruiter, image copy recuiter, shaman en kor. 
My hand is force, disenchant, redundant true-name, dark confidant, brainstorm, Vial.

He tells me he has no good answer to true name except for racing it, which was harder now that his deck had all that hate in it now. 
 
4-0 in matches, 8-0 in games  good enough for Jace Tms.

overall this actually wasn't good for the testing puposes I wanted, too many people drew bad. I cant really draw that many conclusions. Whatever.

Sure was fun though!

	<TEXT> This card screws your curve so bad. I'm thinking about miracles hands that have island plains this, and your opponent goes glistener elf go. Sure you swords now, but in this match your mana is so tight you're gonna die with this in hand most likely.

also, what land do you cut for this? fetches? duals? utility karakas? basics?

Lastly i think Tithe might just be better than this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah people really just don't look at other decks when approching the format. You're not wrong,
its just your conclusion is misleading. 

Conversion rate is what is important here, but we cant have that data for the vast majority of tournaments.

If  deck A has 5 players, and deck B has 10 players, and they both put 1 person in top 8, guess which deck was better for that tournament? 

This is what happened with BR reanimator. No one took it seriously until they saw it present a high conversion rate at eternal weekend, but the deck had no new printings and existed forever before that. 
Everything in there had been done before, even in concert with each other, but that was the first time it had been played at an event where people could say:
This deck has a high conversion rate.      </TEXT>

sorry.

BR reanimator and Aluren are two recent decks that have existed forever and with no real new cards printed have exploded in popularity, proving your point and debunking the myth that deck strength is tied inextricably to deck popularity.

Even card choices in popular decks are like this. Joe losetts deck is a rotten ham sandwich, He himself says it's suboptimal. 

People still try to play "losett miracles" until they realize its actually loser miracles and smarten up.

Your best bet if you want something unusual is to find something that used to be playable years ago, then update for now with the understanding that there will be metas where its good and metas where it isnt.

For example, i hate casting fair brainstorm. competitively, that doesn't leave me with a whole lot of options.
so i just bring updated versions of legacy fogeys so often that people call me "Old Spice"

Can liliana protect jace?

What if said demon goes something like "someone I've influenced is going to backstab the gatewatch" and garruk shows up? 

how fast does lilana go to take him out, how fast does she get kicked, and how fast do events unfold as above?

Carrot: You get a jace slave. Stick : I kill jace.

I wager shes just damaged enough to be led like this, just egotistical enough to think this is the only way, and has all the tools

	<TEXT> No.

$t4ks (not stax)  is a deck that originated in vintage as a way to 
solve the base blue infested meta. it has smokestack in it, but the deck was called The four thousand dollar solution.

interpose the s and the t and that gives you Stacks.

later the deck focussed more on the cards smokestack and the name changed a bit.

nowadays vintage largely has no "stax and it has been replaced with workshop aggro."

I looked at that pile of edh cards, and, while it is a prison strategy,
you dont get to call it stax if you don't have smokestack the card as
 a central part of your gameplan.

This is what happens when you culturally appropriate part of the history of another groups format. Fogeys like me get excited that you're talking about magic history and click, and then channel the ensuing disappointment into educating you on the difference between their old thing and your new thing.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the setup:

Liliana gets blackmailed by one of her demons into betraying the gatewatch.

Teferi petitions the gatewatch to help investigate what appears to be the start of a phyrexian incursion.

upon arrival in Urborg, Jace is bitten by a zombie and necrosis sets in. under the guise of helping remove it,

Liliana takes control of him via a partial reanimation spell.

"You thought the eldrazi were a problem? You should've helped me with mine. Now you know how it feels to be on the receiving end"

"Liliana, the Betrayer" or "liliana, Breaker of Oaths"

"Jace, undead puppet(art has jace with chain veil puppet strings)"

Now with the master telepath under her control, Teferi shows up and gets mindsculpted. unable to fight temporal manipulation zombies, to say nothing of Jace, infinte telepath,  they decide to go handle liliana's chronic demon problem.

All the while, the phrexians further their machinations unchecked...



Eternal Waltz 2UUBB

(art depicts Jace and Lili dancing in the ruins of lord windgraces mansion, 
Jace with chain veil puppet strings, superimposed over screaming Teferi.

enchantment

At end of turn, return to play all permenents that left play this turn.

Each player gains life equal to the amount of life lost this turn.

If no player controls a Planeswalker, sacrifice Eternal waltz.

	<TEXT> in the context of that being the advice, i should mention that in addition to the d t deck in my flair, I have  the shells for most of maverick, alluren, celaphid breakfast, manaless dredge, ant, br reanimator,
tezzerator, encantress, burn, food chain, miracles, and grixis delver (although i do not like the way miracles controls the game or the way grixis delver seems to operate. ) 

I probably also have shells for other decks im not thinking of. I tend to pick up the most wins in my meta by either playing a deck that is tier 2+ and correctly anticipating the meta that event, or playing a 
tier 1-1.5 deck and making a bunch of generally subpar card choices that turn out to be correct in the meta that i anticipate. 

My actual play skill is all over the place, dependent on what time of the day it is and what day it is. Sleep problems suck.     

the reality of the situation is that my matchup win percentage goes up here the greater variety of weird stuff i get to play, and so my goal is just to improve the size of my collection of  decks i can build here. It just so happens that  prison and awkward combo can play the most strange garbage.  </TEXT>

I wouldn't mind red getting free spells in their slice of the color pie though. pyrokenisis is probably over the top, but crash, thunderclap, mogg alarm, downhill charge, flameshot,
the only awkward one is maybe cave in and that makes more sense as pitch tremor anyways. Unless you count blazing shoal.

	<TEXT> this is a good point. However now we're talking about a maindeckable answer that a large enough group of decks could play to force the rest of the decks in the format to slow down and interact. This answer must handle both creature and noncreature threats, but may not have
to do so on the stack. 

For reference on how powerful this card is, thoughtseize is close to
this card but too proactive, and abrupt decay does about half of this cards job. counterspell is actually 1 mana too slow to fix our problem, while also taking a dump on anyone still not trying to kill you immediately. a force/ counterspell hybrid might do it.

Maybe.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes on account force is easier to fight with discard than pump spells.  

Id much rather give the format misdirection than force though.

Much safer than either of these are the free spells that don't remotley resemble countermagic. abolish,pyrokinesis, cave in, contagion, freaking tidal bore and orims cure can go a long way 
towards solving problems out of the sideboard.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> i just noticed how many widely played decks have key cards that happen to be trinket mage targets.   

miracles - top  
eldrazi- chalice    
storm- lions eye diamond  
death and taxes - aether vial    
lands- mox diamond    

Its almost like if you arent playing delver or midrange, you need to ask yourself why you aren't playing a trinket. 

Obviously with legacy being as diverse as it is there are some exceptions, like show and tell and reanimator, probably elves too.

I don't know if this is useful as anything other than food for thought, but it sure as heck makes why chalice is insane in this meta crystal clear if for some dumb reason it wasn't already.

Wow, I've never seen so many people misunderstand in my life.(hyperbole). my point wasn't "everyone, lets play trinket mage" that card is terrible in the majority of decks that have blue mana. my point was "In addition to all the cards people put in their decks for consistency and efficiency reasons, look at all these engine and glue pieces that also get hit by chalice at zero and one. Also tier 2+ strategies tend not to have one."

Just for future reference, how many people here know of the reference to 0-1 casting cost artifacts as trinkets?
it might help me write something like this so that i don't get chewed out because people focus on something i didn't actually type.

	<TEXT> What can i do about testing for mold in my buildings hallway?

If it is there, its been there for months, and it's probably not going anywhere anytime soon. i can confirm wet spots on the floor, and i can confirm that this floor does not get cleaned often enough for what happens on it ( family down the hall doesn't properly dispose of diapers, almost always gets left in the garbage chute for at least 2 days.) 

When i complain to landlord about mess, she says she has no real control over what people do about trash and spills.

Help?

	<TEXT> Actually i'm pretty sure you spun it twice.

5 minutes might be generous, I didn't really start thinking about what happened until minute 2, and i think when that game finished there were 15 minutes left in the round. 

I did however take longer than i probably should have shuffling pre-game, so whatever we'll call it even.

I refuse to believe that i figured out most of what you had in less than a minute. There's no way I'm that good. Nope. Don't believe it. Occams Razor. </TEXT>
