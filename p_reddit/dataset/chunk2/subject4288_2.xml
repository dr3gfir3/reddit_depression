However, despite stating that he was unable to read or understand Russian, metadata of emails sent from Guccifer 2.0 to The Hill showed that a Russian-language-only VPN was used. When pressed to use the Romanian language in an interview with Motherboard via online chat, "he used such clunky grammar and terminology that experts believed he was using an online translator."

	<TEXT> Only the smallest states have a truly disproportionate number of votes. An state's electoral college votes are equal to it's congressional votes - which, with the exception of the hundred senators which are allocated equally, are allocated by population. 

And this makes sense. The president represents the entire country - each state should have a say. If it was allocated purely by population, Wyoming, Alaska, Vermont, Alaska, the Dakotas, etc, would all get one vote instead of three - or about .2% of the voting power rather than .6%. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Because if they need to do it, they should be able to do it.

Sure. But this is why Wyoming and Hawaii get seats at the table. So the government doesn't decide to fuck with the states with the smallest populations.

Why not put it in the constitution like they did with the other minorities you mentioned, then?

If discriminating against states was constitutionally forbidden it would create a Supreme Court tangle of biblical proportions.

 So? That's good! Oklahoma, Ohio and Minnesota shouldn't get to take giant shits all over the environment. They should be incentivized to find something better to do.

Fine, but again - those states should be part of the conversation. States aren't arbitrarily defined - they are like countries. They are discrete entities with distinct economies, histories, and cultures. Most joined the union voluntarily. Their federal representation and rights are important and clearly defined. A majority of the US population shouldn't be able to tyrannize small member states any more than a majority of the EU should be able to tyrannize Belgium or Luxembourg. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But why favor this minority and not any of the other infinite other minorities? Why not weight gay Jews 100 times more voting power?

Two reasons. Firstly, the rights of Jews, other religious minorities, and to a much lesser extent, minority sexual orientations, are protected by the constitution. Jews don't get extra rights, because in principle the Constitution protects them from oppression. Nothing prevents the US government from deciding to pave Wyoming or store all of its nuclear waste in Hawaii. To make up for this, Wyoming and Hawaii each get a small amount of guaranteed legislative power that is disproportionate to their populations.

Secondly, states have much, much more disparate interests than most other groups of people. They aren't arbitrary. While the government isn't likely to do anything malicious to a state, it very likely could decide to tax oil production to fund renewable energy research. This could severely harm Oklahoma, Ohio, and Minnesota and benefit California. States were guaranteed certain rights when the joined the union, and this included their legislative and voting power. Reducing their power so you can harm their interests would be unethical (and illegal, since they likely wouldn't surrender that power voluntarily.  </TEXT>

What games are you getting low performance in? That iGPU is underpowered for most PC gaming. That being said:

1. Make sure your BIOS is up to date. MSI has a tool that will do this automatically. ("Live Update," I think?)

2. Make sure this isn't thermal throttling: download [HWMonitor](http://www.cpuid.com/downloads/hwmonitor/hwmonitor_1.30.exe) and check your gaming temps.

3. If your temps are OK, I guess you are power throttling or boost is misbehaving. Go into the BIOS, turn off turbo boost and set the multiplier to x37.

Edit: This [beginner's guide](http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-overclock-amd-cpu-processor/2/) to OCing that processor should help you get a stable CPU clock, whether you want to overclock or not.

	<TEXT> The United States Government owes a very large number of dollars, about $14.3 trillion. A more meaningful answer is that has a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 73% -- that is, it owes about 73% of a year's worth of 'economy.' 

This may seem alarming, but it shouldn't be. Most companies are in debt for their entire existences. Since the US government isn't going anywhere, it can continually issue new treasury bonds and maintain a level of indebtedness forever, so long as it can afford the interest on the debt. 

And the government can borrow at essentially free - a 1-year treasury bond pays .8% interest. People buy these bonds because they are almost perfectly safe investments - if the US Government isn't paying is bills, nobody else is either and you have big big things to worry about. 

Now, that doesn't mean that any amount of debt is safe. Greece and Venezuela can't pay their bills and several countries have gone bankrupt in the past. This happens if your country borrows too much, loses its reputation as a reliable borrower, and is forced to borrow at higher interest rates (to make up for the added risk.) If the interest fees accumulate faster than revenue can be increased and spending can be cut, you get trapped in a "death spiral" and must be bailed out or go bankrupt. What level is safe isn't exactly clear, but it's approximately 100% (since economic growth is generally over 1% and interest rates are around 1%.)

So, in sort, it doesn't effect you directly. What it does effect is how much safe borrowing is "left" for the future. </TEXT>

Sort of. You can buy a higher maximum bandwidth, but that doesn't help you if the network is congested. A better analogy might be a freeway. A higher bandwidth connection would allow you place more cars on the highway at the same time, but it won't get them to their destination any faster.

	<TEXT>  It's definitely Jerry-rigging. Even if it came from a different term it's still Jerry-rigging. Even if people still use that other term, it's still Jerry-rigging as well.

Jerry-rigging [is](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/132868/jury-rigged-or-jerry-rigged) [a](https://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/jerry.html) fifty-year-old [misspelling](http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2008/08/a-jerry-rigged-expression.html) of jury-rig. It's certainly not from WWI, or even WWII.

	<TEXT>  this is the best argument I've seen so far. A few more questions though.

 Yes debt is an acceptable risk when the payout is worth it but what exactly have we gained from our debt? our infrastructure is failing, our education has been left behind, our middle class is shrinking..etc etc. 

[Here's a brief summary of where the money goes.](https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/budget-graphic.png)

Most government spending isn't easy to cut. We can't stop paying Social Security, lay off a bunch of the military, etc. Government spending, fuelled by borrowing, pays for the military, the education system, Medicare, Medicaid, subsidized housing, food stamps, and etc.

And the debt isn't actually growing very much. As McKoijion summarized (but didn't state explicitly,) the dollar amount of debt doesn't really matter. A better indicator is the Debt-to-GDP ratio, which compares the size of the debt to the economy. If it is growing, the size of the debt is increasing faster than the size of the economy. This isn't sustainable long-term; we're borrowing faster than our ability to repay is growing. 

If it's shrinking, even if we are borrowing more dollars, our ability to maintain the debt is growing faster than the debt is. This is very common in both healthy economies and growing businesses. It's like buying a new factory with a mortgage or borrowing to buy new equipment.  

[Here is a plot of the debt-to-GDP ratio over time.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/51129-land-summaryfigure1%281%29.png) As you can see, it spiked up mostly in times of crisis, like WWII and the Great Recession, where it was important to borrow money to win the war and to save the auto industry and financial system. The heavy borrowing isn't a sign of mismanagement, it's a sign of very bad situations being mitigated as much as possible.

The other big period of growth is Reagan and HW Bush's presidencies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The assumption is that a stake in the company would be in lieu of other compensation, and that a stake in the company is near worthless (since TNA is basically a vanity project and isn't expected to ever make money.)

Typically (I'm drawing analogies to other industries where employees are often given ownership stakes here like law, medicine, etc.) partnerships also require a very long-term commitment to the company as well, and are voided if the partner leaves of his own volition, so there isn't really a good way to "cash out" next time TNA starts tanking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Reddit, I have thirty+ hours of travel time coming up next week and I'm going to need some reading material. I'm not thinking of anything in particular, maybe some sci-fi, horror, and a few short stories. Something Gothic/Southern Gothic would be cool too.

I enjoy, and have read most of: 

- William Gibson
- Raymond Chandler
- H.P. Lovecraft
- Paolo Bacigalupi
- Hunter S. Thompson
- Fyodor Dostoevsky
- R.A. Heinlein
- Stephen King

I dislike:

 - John Scalzi 
 - Patrick Rothfus
 -  House of Leaves
 - Robert J. Sawyer
 - Frank Herbert </TEXT>
