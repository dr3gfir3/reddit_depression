	<TEXT> Haha well at least you recognize the inherent moral fucked-upedness of how powerful and ubiquitous Nestle is. I do tend to sometimes think "Just fuck it, I ain't changing shit," but at the end of the day, I feel like if I don't stand on principle for SOMETHING then I simply am feeding into the global mentality of "Eh, as long as it doesn't affect me." It is hard as HELL to avoid Nestle and everything they own, but making the effort makes me feel mildly better as a person. Gotta take the little victories I suppose. "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nestle has used a tremendous amount of cocoa beans harvested in West Africa using child slave labor. The company has always been a horribly exploitative one, and I avoid their products at all costs. There's an interesting documentary about how children are trafficked into plantations to work the cocoa beans that are sold to companies like Nestle.
