"I don't know" would have been 10x better response and less suspect. 

"Are they okay?" 100x.

"I got stung by a wasp, are they okay?" 1000x.

Getting stung by a wasp was an excuse, after he found out how grave the injury he caused to "teach a lesson".  

It's perfect, no one will ever find the wasp, and he could claim later that he thought he got stung when it turns out he does not have and wasp related injury. 

It's unfortunate that wrongdoing on his part cannot be proven, because now he know he can get away with it again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me fix that: there would have been a very high chance that he would have threatened to kill them and just a slightly lower chance that he would make good on the threat.

Either way would you like to be the target of this guys rage if he's got a gun? He's a marine, there's a high chance he had a gun in his vehicle. 

And the point was this: uncontrollable rage with or without a weapon from a tool like this should be taken seriously and punished harshly. 

A prison term would reduce his chances of ever owning a gun legally, and deter him from a similar behavior in the future. </TEXT>

Not saying it's a good or bad thing, but blaming the U.S. since it ends up being the last to touch the hot potato, is just absurd.

The U.S. also have in the past and present tried to proactively protect its interest, but I don't see it having the level of fuck-up as when Western Europe or European powers in general instigates the fuck-up themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Exorcist had this very brief scene showing the statue of the Virgin Mary beheaded and sporting makeshift tits. 

13 year old Catholic me was horrified by it, even when I eventually shed off religion. It was even more disturbing than seeing the Linda Blair fuck herself bloody with a crucifix screaming "Fuck me Jesus, Fuck Me!"

In the book, which I read before the movie - for some reason the crucifix masturbation scene was somewhat more disturbing.

William Peter Blatty is very hard to top.

The U.S. became a world power, and honestly I can't think of a better nation to wield this position. I'm not saying this because I'm pro U.S. but because the U.S. is a country of immigrants, any significant group of which could pose as an argument against the U.S. going to war against their own homelands or their friends' - it does not always work out that way, but it does put a counter-balance against the type of behavior we see from nations that do not have significant immigrant population or cultural makeup as the U.S. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should also look at what Obama accomplished despite the opposition; to cite a few:

- restored the worlds respect in the U.S.
- passed the affordable care act (perfect if only congress hadn't hobbled it)
- major and hopefully lasting victories in the gay rights movement 
- financial reforms (again hobbled by republican congress and crony)
- demolished the taliban 
- improved the economy
- improved the mix of supreme court 

he had some fuck ups too, but if you tally his wins and losses, I think it's easy to argue that he did a lot of good as POTUS

he's got one more year left - and seeing that he has nothing to lose anymore, one could hope that he would swing for the rafters and tackle issues traditionally considered risqu by politicians. </TEXT>

Bonus point for using as few pieces as possible.

Artsy Fartsy points if you use materials that relate to the shadow image you are projecting (eg, bullets and guns and pills and cash to project the shadow of a man in prison) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the joke would have been that when The Bear Jew came out after so much buildup, the viewers would recognize its Adam Sandler and be surprised and confused.

And if they made his character look normal, or even slightly nebbish, the follow up to the joke would have been when he goes ape shit with the bat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> drag her to join a JiuJitsu school. I find that the amount of physical contact and exertion involved tend to organically forge bonds if not friendship. 

don't look for friendship, but don't shun it either. just train consistently, and before you know it, you and her will be part of a group that has a difficult enough barrier to entry that the relationships you guys find will be more than superficial. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A family friend of ours, her father was one of the HukBaLaHap leaders during the Japanese occupation in the Philippines.

She told the U.S. the story of how her father ordered or carried out the execution by beheadings of a collaborator, who it turns out was the father of one of her childhood friends.

Even crazier, she and that friend of hers moved and lived and grew old in the same city in the U. S.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw Kennerly talk about his time as the White House Chief Photographer (I think that was his title) - it was very interesting. 

He reported to Ford directly, which now was never done before, and it was one of his conditions before he would take the job. It prompted Ford to jokingly ask if Kennerly would also like to use Air Force One on weekends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not WTF, OP is just ignorant.

The doctor is washing that boy's ass. He's using a *tab*  - a water scooper, which could be just about anything that can be used to scoop and pour water.

Filipinos, and most Asian cultures, wash their genitals and butt  with water  in addition to wiping with toilet paper after doing their business.
