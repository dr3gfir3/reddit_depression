	<TEXT> I really don't think the focus should be on the fact that "hundreds of women" are throwing him a party; is that not just the (mainstream?) media perpetuating a myth against men? That that's what men want?

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure he'd be delighted with all of the female attention, just as women are flattered to receive (positive) male attention, but I'm sure that first and foremost he appreciated how acceptant society is of him as a whole, men and women, right?

Just because a woman is organizing the event doesn't alter the fact, for better or for worse, that this whole story is about common human decency. </TEXT>

Pretty much sums up my approach to hitting women, TBH; whatever your political ideals or viewpoints, it's never okay for anyone to hit you, and anyone under assault is well within their rights to defend themselves against their assailant, regardless of gender.

Obviously sports like MMA (which I admit to being woefully ignorant in) lie outside of this, but it's an interesting take on what she's essentially saying here, I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that in trying to avoid confusion they just ended up creating far more than was necessary. I mean, the 2012 film *steamrolled* the Connery/Thurman effort, as well as the show it was based on.

That said, I think it could've set a precedent for the apparent naming scheme we're seeing in the MCU. For instance, we saw *Iron Man*, *Iron Man 2*, and then *Iron Man 3*, but neither the *Thor* or *Captain America* films adopted numerical identifiers, instead opting for sub-titles to distinguish them as different films. Heck, even Cap's first outing got a sub-title. We're seeing this again with *Age of Ultron* rather than just *Avengers 2*.

I imagine the idea is to add longevity to the film's, because realistically any "4" placed next to an *Iron Man* title card at this stage is bound to look a little rusty. By using sub-titles, each film gives the impression of a self-contained story, and doesn't have to rely upon its predecessors, sequels, or build-up.

In conclusion, as irritating the the alternate title may have been for *The Avengers*, in the long run it may have kept more in line with the titling system for the MCU.

I do wonder if *GotG 2* is going to be retitled at some point, though... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This probably also makes the MRM a lot weaker...

Perhaps in terms of numbers, but in reality offers us a greater clarity of discourse. For instance, going by the true definition of feminism, the MRM *is* feminism. The problem is that people equate the true meaning behind and goal of feminism with radical feminism. Mary needs feminism so her job is protected while she tries to conceive, whereas Sarah "needs" feminism because [teh sH1tL0rd paytreearkhy iz spredding raep kulchure](https://imgur.com/gallery/4NOQk).

Both women in the above cases are termed feminists, one is legitimate, the other an absolute lunatic. One is going to bring the other down with her, and no amount of #notallfeminists hashtags are going to make any difference.

The MRM, on the other hand, possesses clear and distinct terminology separating its goals from those of pick-up artists and those who push their red pills. We could bloat ourselves with their ranks by allowing their ideas a place on this sub's front page, but that would "blur the lines," as it were, between their goals and our own.

We're fortunate, in a sense, that we can explain away a lot of accusations against MRM with the use of clear and concise terminology; we can explain away the red pill and PUAs as just that, a different "movement," whereas a true, genuine feminist has to break down his or her entire belief set as being separate from those of someone also calling themselves a feminist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Global economics - I'd this absurd idea that we had modern-day treasure hunters digging for chests buried by pirates years ago, and at the end of every working day my dad and his colleagues would walk through a checkout-like system, only *they* were the ones receiving the money, said "money" being handfuls of gold coins, gemstones, scepters, crowns, you name it.

It never occurred to me too actually take a look at this treasure, I just assumed Dad managed that as he did everything else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I seem to remember someone here mentioning the possibility that The Living Brain could be somehow involved. I was thinking about this not too long ago, and maybe it was just how dark my bedroom was right before I fell asleep, or it might've been my half-dreaming mind at work, but I'd a really vivid idea as to how it could be presented in the books:

So The Living Brain does something that earns Pete's gratitude, just something small (like welcoming him home from Spider-Verse) and Pete gives him a big ol' slap on the back/side, or even a comical hug. Anyway, the thud on Living Brain's tri-titanium shell is shown, close up, on the far-left of a two-page spread, with nothing but a hard blackness (maybe displaying three lighter black "layers?") from there over to the far-right, where we see some bubbles floating upwards through a sliver of turquoise soup. The following page opens with a close-up on a closed eye, protected behind a goggle, with the sound of the muffled "thud" from three pages earlier  visible just behind it. The eye opens, large, wide, and alert, surveying its surroundings before it, and the reader, realise that it's the foetal body of Doctor Octopus, suspended in a tank of amniotic fluid *inside The Living Brain*.

Whether that's Ock's *actual* body, or just a clone he was growing (based upon the original, which he himself may have commandeered?), I guess that might make for a pretty intense mystery, and the consciousness piloting said body might be another story, but I think this'd make for some really amazing imagery, especially as a cliffhanger.

Anybody got any thoughts on this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That show she did about weight loss? I mean, I agree with her in that there's a lot wrong with the whole body acceptance movement, but she's going the entirely wrong way about showing that.

You don't need a degree in biochemistry to know that caloric input should roughly equal caloric output, and it's generally accepted that different body types *do* exist, but the psychology behind weight management is probably the single most important aspect of that challenge that exists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Atheism is the lack of belief in gods and nothing else.

That's more of a textbook definition, I think, than the understanding of atheism adopted by the masses, including many atheists themselves. In actuality, many self-proclaimed atheists tend more towards [anti-theism]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitheism) and (preferably, IMHO) [humanism]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism).

I don't know what this man's understanding of atheism is or was, but a hate-crime doesn't have to depend upon one's own beliefs - if I remember correctly, Elliot Rogers (the Santa Barbara shooter) passionately hated Asians, even though he himself was half-Asian. </TEXT>
