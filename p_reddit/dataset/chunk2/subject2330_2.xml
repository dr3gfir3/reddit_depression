	<TEXT> The Book of Job is probably my favorite book of the Bible. Nothing fantastic really happens, a guy just loses his entire family, his health, and every thing he ever owned. He writes a few letters back and forth to friends about how he doesn't hate God, but loves him even more so. Christian's love this story and use it as an example of how faith works.  

The best part of the book is the whole subplot of God and Satan's conversation. Satan essentially tells God that Job only loves him, because God has given **everything** to Job. It's never clear if God himself takes part in the atrocities in Job's life or just lets Satan commit the acts. In the end all that really matters is God pretty smugly says to Satan, "Job has lost everything and he still loves me", while sticking his tongue out. Satan says, "*well I guess I was wrong*" while sort of shrugging his shoulders and fucking off into the sunset.  

What a great tale. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would you buy a console version of Dissida? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-13 14:54:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Back around Christmas of 2009 I thought my Final Fantasy days were over. I was 10 when FF7 came out and I fell in love. Over the next 10+ years I played the entire catalogue over and over but could never get in FFXIII.  

My sweet grandmother who could never accept that I was getting older(22) bought me a PSP and Dissida for Christmas. I was so grateful because I was about to realize a dream I had had since I was 10, Final Fantasy 7 in my pocket.  

I ignored Dissida because I didn't really understand it for the first month. After 100% completion of FF7 I bought a guide for Dissida and really dug in. The story was OK, but what really shined through was the actual mechanics and fighting system. I was hooked and started convincing all of my FF fan friends to get the game. The summer of 2010 was just amazing being able to be a kid again sitting around with my group of friends, fighting our favorite characters.  

The point of this post basically is that I'm obviously in love with Dissida. I feel as if it's the best fighting game I have ever played. Mortal Kombat/Tekken/Street Fighter do not compare in my opinion. Ever since that summer I've been longing for that experience again. I believe a console based online fighting game like Dissida could make ridiculous money for Squenix.  

My question is, would you buy it? Is there any real interest in a console release? I think the possibilities are endless. I don't care if they remake the first game, just want a game where I have RPG elements in a fighter. They could potentially release the game with 20 characters and then later release over time through DLC every character from FF history.  

**TL;DR** Dissida is the GOAT fighting game. Would you drop $60 to beat your friends ass as Onion Knight and all your other iconic Square friends? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting but no I don't think so. Krypton hadn't set out explorers in hudreds if not thousanes of years. Every colony Zod found had been barren for a couple hundred years. One of those exploration colonies came to Earth, and that's how Kal got his Kryptonian under armor. I can't remember how long but I'm pretty sure even the Earth ship was there for several thousand years. </TEXT>
