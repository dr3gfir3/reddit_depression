Being a peaceful resident should not be punished...pretty simple. Calling someone an illegal alien doesn't erase their inalienable rights, and the Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishment, disproportionate and detached from the crime. Is that supposed to be controversial now? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Many of them have children who are citizens, almost all of them play an important role in the communities they are staying in. It sucks, but immigration policy should have been enforced properly for the last two decades; the mistake was in letting them think they could put down roots without legal authorization to do so.

This is like saying, "yes deporting these people is cruel to children and value-wise pointless, but you know we made that choice and should really commit to it."

 There are about five million Mexicans who have no right whatsoever to be here. The United States has the right to kick them out.

It really doesn't, it is wrong to be cruel.  </TEXT>

Certainly better than the experience of thousands who wait 20+ years for their legality - that are usually the refugee immigrants and manual-labor migrants, rather than the preferred highly skilled professionals who can get legality with a sponsorship from their employer (such an important quality of citizenship). Your personal situation might have seemed just, but it is not a great basis for deciding what's best for everyone. </TEXT>

The majority of these cartels get their products through bloodshed in Central America - including humans, fleeing the ironically U.S.-manufactured political crises in Honduras and El Salvador. 

Meanwhile in America, illegal immigrants are breaking into our neighborhoods, building our homes, becoming doctors. It's just an incomparable situation, and saying Mexico = America is baffling hypocrisy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Right, but having a "like" population somewhere does matter for something.

much "like" apartheid!

 As an example, look at how Russia used the presence of ethnic Russians as their (superficial) justification for annexing Crimea.

Mexico = Russia?? Texas = Crimea?? OMG, do you think illegal immigration is Mexico's secret plan to retake the Aztec homeland??

 If you don't have borders then you don't have countries. 

God forbid we become such a wretched world! No one to bomb, no one to exile, no one to scapegoat - it sounds miserable!

 The only person intimating immigrants as enemies is you.

You're the only person comparing Latin American immigrants to armed troops occupying Crimea...
