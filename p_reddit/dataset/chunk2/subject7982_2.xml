	<TEXT> Okay so just think about Gendry, and how much we miss him, right? I figure he will make a reappearance in season 7, and end up pledging himself somehow to Dany. Maybe he learned how to forge Valyrian steel or something like that. In return for this, I think once Dany is queen, she will legitimize him as a Baratheon, in exchange for him pledging his support to her, and he will take control of the Stormlands.

If this happens it will be a neat little way to tie-up his story line, and give him a bit of a reward for rowing a boat for over three seasons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A really simple explanation is due to convection. So basically the middle of a planet contains a bunch of super hot metals, iron, etc. In a planet like Earth, this is all super hot, but the material at near the crust is cooler than the material at the center. This causes the material to move, the hot material moves out towards the crust, the cool material in towards the center, creating a bit of a loop. This movement of metal is what causes the magnetic field itself.

In planets like Venus and Mars, the center has cooled to a more uniform temperature, so there is less movement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, all magnets are dipole. You will never have a magnet in which there's only positive, and no negative.

As for your other question, yes some planets do not have magnetic poles, like Venus and Mars. It depends on the interior of the planet, especially the temperature variation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is fun. So lets say you went back in time 6 years took up the offer of "SmokeTooMuch" in 2010 and bought 10,000 bitcoins for $50. And because you can tell the future, you sell right before they hit 1250 (Probably triggering the bubble collapse by yourself.) Sweet! You now have 12.5 million dollars! 

But you're a greedy asshole, aren't you? You want more. It is now November 2013, and you are going to play the stock market. You look at your pile of money, and think back to what you know from that one time you flipped on CNBC. I'm just going to assume you're stupid and only want to invest, not gamble.

You know that oil dropped a lot, but you don't know about investing so you go find an expert. You Google around and find a portfolio manager in your city. You schedule an appointment, stop at the bank, then head down to his office. You walk in, and drop a duffel-bag on his desk.

"Invest this."

He seems confused, and asks you to repeat yourself.

"This is 12.5 million dollars. Invest this."

His eyes widen for a split second, but he recovers. He's used to dealing with crazy millionaires, after all. 

"Okay sir, I can invest this for you. What are you interested in? We have some nice long-term bonds if you are looking, or maybe we can place it in some reliable oil shar-"

"No. No oil. In-fact, please stay away from oil. Actually, can I invest against oil? I want to do that."

His face looks incredulous.

"Sir, we have some very smart investment managers, and we all believe oil will be a steady for the foreseeab-"

"NO. Do not invest my money in oil."

He seems to be getting a bit annoyed, but then gives you a sickly-smile.

"Okay sir, it is your money after all. If you would like to short oil, we can do that? We can even get you a nice little loan to invest a bit more if you would like? This money you already have would be a nice down payment!"

"Whatever that means, do it."

He stares at you.

---

Just under a year later, you are sitting in an office. When oil dropped to $45 dollars a share, you dropped out and immediately payed off your previous loan. You also dropped by the investment office and left the nice man a greeting card.

The men across from you are old friends, you only just met them. You stare at them, and begin speaking.

"What are they paying?"

"Well we aren't really at the liberty to discuss that."

"Okay, I don't care. Whatever they offer, I will beat. Whatever benefits they give you, I will beat."

The men look at each other.

"We'll get back to you next week."

---

June 2016. You finally reached the timeframe you left from. You look at the name plaque on your desk. They stuck with tradition, and let you choose your own title. Underneath your name, it reads:

"Chief Awesomeness Officer and Immortal Time-Lord, Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not really a reference to RVB, but to the joke itself, which is old. However now you have sent me down a rabbit hole.

Know Your Meme lists the joke as starting in 2001 on a radio show, but I have found older references than that. [Here is a forum post from 1996](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.autos.makers.ford.mustang/rrmEo1okMGM) that makes the same joke. [And another from 1994.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.humor/zgYO9JD0aIg)

But we can go back even further than that! [Here is a write-in section from a newspaper](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=191 dat=19841129 id=KV5OAAAAIBAJ sjid=GS4DAAAAIBAJ pg=3770,3531287 hl=en) from 1986. If you look for the  Speak-Out that starts "I'M CALLING IN RESPONSE" you'll see that the blinker fluid joke was funny back then as well.

Sorry for the long response, but this was fun to research. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys. Just a quick little bug I experienced. Have any of you had anything like this?

I was doing matchmaking, searching through Hoops. I joined a game just like normal, however when I got into the game it was basically a custom game:

- Time stuck at 3:20
- Hockey puck instead of basketball
- Unlimited boost
- No gravity
- And quite a few more.

After about 30 seconds it kicked me and I didn't get a replay. But I thought it was really strange. Anybody see this ever? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Exploring Gavin's "The sky is bigger than the ground". The height at which that becomes true </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-06 21:53:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everybody that reads this. I just wanted to go into Gavin's statement on "The sky is bigger than the ground" and see if I can quantify it.

I just wanted to quickly go over how we could say that the sky is bigger than the ground, and I realized the best way is to compare the volume of the ground (Earth) against the volume of the sky (our atmosphere?). We can see at which height the volume of the air is more than the volume of the ground, and therefore at which height "The sky is bigger than the ground."

So here are some useful variables and valuables:

V^e is the volume of Earth, about 1.083E12 Km^3

V^a is the volume of the air

h is height.

r^e is the radius of the earth, about 6371km.

We can define V^a to be [(4/3)\*pi\*(h+r^e )^3 ]-[(4/3)\*pi\*(6371)^3 ]

We set this equal to V^e, to determine where they are equal. Above that point, the "sky" is bigger than the ground. After solving for these two, I found that h=1655km. So anywhere past 1655 km up from the surface is where the sky is bigger than the ground.

---

Of course Gavin could have just meant surface area. This is just a fun little bit of math to see the surface area at the surface of the Earth, vs a surface area at 35000ft, about the height airplanes fly at. 

r^e = 3959 miles

r^sky = 3959+6.6 = ~3966

A^e = 4\*pi\*(3959)^2 = 196961284 sq mi

A^sky = 4\*pi\*(3966)^2 = 197658403 sq mi

So this means there is an increase of about 700000 sq miles, which is a lot, but only a .3% increase.

So yes Gavin, the sky is definitely bigger than the ground, but only barely. Thanks for entertaining me on my lunch break. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 3v3 strategy question - Group movement </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-14 22:15:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys, I'm a relatively new player, and had a quick strategy question about playing 3v3. The question will refer to **[this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/fQr5GJV.png)** 

So in this picture, there is a group of players about to approach the opposing teams goal with the ball (Orange arrow). We'll say this is a group that has two of my players and two on the other team, and they are moving with the ball. The other opposing player is on the border of their goal, playing defense.

I am the lone player not on that side of the court, but am approaching from my goal (Yellow Arrow). So here is my question. For the best chance at scoring the goal, should I approach with 1 or 2, assuming the timing isn't right for center?

With approach 1, I can cover the ball if it shoots out from the wall, and also better hit the ball if the opposing team stops the movement. However with approach 2 I can have a great hit on the goal if the ball gets out front, and also can get to the ball quicker if it leaves the group at all.

So this is my question to you, do you think it is better to go against the rotation, or with it, when approaching the other teams goal?

Believe it or not, as a beginner situations pop up like this all the time, so it would be great to know. I'm always unsure what way to go when I see it happening!

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here is my details:

I have WIFI set to always on.

I have a strong WIFI connection

I've rebooted my phone, multiple times

Almost every time I turn off my screen for an extended period of time - more than a few minutes, my phone will switch off WIFI and turn on LTE. This has become a huge problem, because now I can no longer listen to Pandora without checking it every few minutes. I used a good bit of data last night because my phone turned off WIFI and used data when I had the screen off. If I turn-off background data, then Pandora won't even work unless I manually change the song.

I know this was a common issue, so is there any fix for it?

Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Meta] The Rooster Teeth subreddit does not like self posts - stats inside </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-02 16:12:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys. I noticed a lot of down-votes in this sub, and kind of wanted to dig in. I found out that, excluding posts by mods or RT employees, people really like to down-vote a lot of self posts on this sub.

What I did is just went through the 40 newest self posts, and took the score of each one. Here are my results:

 - Number of posts: 40

 - Average score: 4.375

 - **Median Score: 0**

 - Number of posts in double-digits: 4

 - **Number of posts at 0 points: 29!**

The funny thing is, these stats show that this posts has a very good chance of being down-voted and not seen by many people. So here comes the question:

Should we do something about this, and if so, what?

Some people think that this is okay, it just keeps the subreddit clean. However I am of the opinion that this is very stifling to open discussion. People might be afraid to post anything to this sub in fear of being down-voted. Obviously "fake internet point" aren't a big deal. However it is demoralizing to put a lot of effort into a post, or have an honest question, and have people just not give a damn.

So what can be done about it? Other different subs have different ways of dealing with stuff like this. Some subs hide the down-vote arrows. This isn't a perfect fix, and you can still downvote on mobile or with RES, but it does reduce rampant down-voting.

Another solution is that some subs use daily discussion threads for self-posts like these. The mods in this sub had a (in my opinion) great idea and started the free-talk Friday thread. Threads like these can be collectors for self-posts. The only issue I have is that if it's a Monday or Tuesday, you generally don't want to wait until Friday to post your thoughts, and the last week discussion thread is already dead.

So this is just something I wanted to share that I noticed. I hope it will lead into a discussion if there is anyway we can fix it, but then again the stats say people will just ignore it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> IRT RT Podcast #263 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-26 18:30:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First post, just want to set a bit of groundwork for how posts on this sub will work. This discussion involved [Burnie](/u/GusSorolaVERIFIED), /u/Gavinfree and the others.

So in this podcast one discussion they have is about [MH370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370) and how they could put a "bug" on it to track where they are. Gavin responds that bad guys could just use an EMP to disable the "bug" and still hijack the airplane.

This is such an interesting point to me because it actually lets me delve into one of my interests, airplanes, and it allows me to explain some differences in planes.

So the first thing is that you may not know what an EMP is. EMP stands for [Electromagnetic Pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse). A basic summary is that it is a pulse of energy that can destroy electronics and cause them to not work anymore. Gavin's theory was that detonating a small one would allow you to kill all tracking hardware on an airplane and still fly the plane to do what ever devious plan you have in mind.

What this all comes down to for me is that Gavin actually unknowingly highlights a huge development in [Aircraft Flight Control Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_flight_control_system). There are a few different ways that you can control an airplane. The first is mechanical, basically just rods, strings, etc. This is commonly used in old or small planes. An easy analogy is riding a bike, your direct movement of the handlebars leads to a direct movement of the wheel.

Another way of controlling an airplane is a hydro-mechanical system. This is similar to the first one, however it uses hydraulics. This is important because hydraulics allows pilots to control large systems without using too much physical exertion. This is akin to driving a car with power steering. You move the wheel, and it uses hydraulics to make it so it's not difficult to make a turn.

The final system I want to go over is the new [Fly-By-Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire) system. This system takes your input on the stick, converts it to a electrical signal, sends it to the control surface motors, and they perform the actions. This is almost akin to driving an RC car, where your control system isn't mechanically linked to the surface you are controlling.

Gavin's idea is really funny in this case, because of the airplane that went missing in this case. MH370 was flying a [Boeing 777](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777). The 777 was the first commercial aircraft that Boeing designed to use the fly-by-wire system.

As a consequence of this, Gavin's idea falls a bit flat, atleast in the case of the 777. Yes, using an EMP would probably stop tracking "bugs" from working, but it would also stop you from being able to control the plane, as none of the fly-by-wire system would work either. You can imagine how this would end up. But his point actually could *theoretically* work on older airplanes, like the older 737s! You would probably run into other problems, like the airplane having been upgraded, but the theory is there!

As a side note, EMPs and airplanes is actually a well-studied area. The E-4 is a large airplane that the US Air Force can use as a command post in the sky in the event of all out war. Because Nuclear Weapons can cause EMPs, this plane is actually [designed with that in mind!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4#Design). It uses analog control systems so it can still fly if everything else is going to hell. So, like many times before, /u/GavinFree made an offhand comment that is actually really insightful!

Thanks for reading. Hope you liked it! If you notice any mistakes please let me know, I'm not an expert, just an enthusiast!

	<TEXT> Hi guys. I have a good sized bar in my house and want to try out some drink recipes that are RT inspired. My hope is to try them out, take pictures, review, etc., and make an Imgur album so people can choose to make them if they want.

So my question for the subs is: Have any ideas? I would like show related, people related, etc. I promise to give you a shout-out in the album when I make it if you come up with something good. One that I'm thinking about trying tonight is inspired by Gus. It's a shot of tequila for the Mexican side, topped with a bit of Tabasco for that Southern temper(?), and chased by pickle juice because lumpy pickles remind me of lumpy Gus.

So come on Reddit, kill my liver!

	<TITLE> Youtube can only run videos at 144p </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi all. So recently, in the last couple of days, YouTube has been struggling to work for me. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/GxPsM0F.png) is an example of the quality I'm faced with. Now my network performance isn't bad. I paused a video and achieved [decent results](http://i.imgur.com/QzdV7oD.png). and while running a video, my system doesn't seem to [struggle](http://i.imgur.com/e9hhXOw.png). However if I run it at anything above 144p, it just can't buffer it. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

	<TITLE> A shooting target that contains a flower seed bomb </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I was looking at flower seed bombs, [like this](http://www.gardenista.com/posts/diy-wildflower-seed-bombs), and thought of a product for gun enthusiasts. Right now, many clay pigeons and other shooting products are biodegradable, so that you can shoot them and leave them at the range. I think that it would be cool if instead of just being biodegradable, they contained seeds.

With this, every time you go out to shoot at your local forest range, you could plant wildflowers as well. Beautify the area much more than before. What do you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Link to Album here](http://imgur.com/a/wOpVR)

So this is my grandpa's old radio: A Stromberg-Carlson, Piece Number 17897, not sure on what model. It would mean a lot to my Mom if I could get it in running condition. Looking at the insides, it seems to be in decent condition, except the fabric style plugs make me cringe.

My question is, what would I need to do make sure this stereo will work and not catch on fire, etc? I can post more pictures as needed, take it apart, and all of that. 

Thanks for the help, and let me know what other information I need to provide!
