	<TEXT> First off, congrats! I would recommend joining the Horror Writer's Association to network and find agents (and to build a support community). But also you can search for authors similar to you and in your genre + agent to see who agents them. Or just search horror - agents. Here is a post on Writer's Digest about them: http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/9-literary-agents-seeking-horror-now.
Also, check out the manuscript wish list for horror:
http://mswishlist.com/profiles/agent/horror
Check the hashtag on twitter too #MSWL for agents seeking horror
If you want to go direct to a publisher, you could do that route too and search for publishers who take submissions direct for horror.
I spent 2 years querying in batches and built a spreadsheet of agents - took 189 to get mine (not horror).
there are new agents all the time so I would also search for "new literary agents" + "horror". New agents are great to query as they are building their client list but have the backing of an agency behind them. 
Good luck!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion, if you're a writer you MUST read. It's part of your job to know how story structure works (and doesn't work) and learn new techniques through reading. When I first started writing novels I lost my love for reading and couldn't concentrate to finish any - it was very depressing. THEN I realized that since I started writing my reading tastes had changed so I started reading things far outside what I ever had before. I fell in love again and realized I wasn't being challenged before and needed new reading challenges to stimulate my passion for reading and writing.  </TEXT>
