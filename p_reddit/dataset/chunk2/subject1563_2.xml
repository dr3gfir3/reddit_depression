 Have you watched MOSAIC?

Me

 After you mentioned it. I don't see the great buzz about it.

That was 35 minutes ago. It is written up above. I have not altered the comment as you can see from the lack of the edit symbol.

So there is no nope, not there. It is quite clearly there. Are you blind?

	<TEXT> There seems to be an entrenched minority on this subreddit that actually is not that impressed with The Nolan Batman and Christopher Nolan in general.

I found the first one boring, the second an enjoyable action film and the third an absolute bore.

I liked Following for what it was, Memento was well made and fairly original at the time, Insomina is actually quite a dull film in mu opinion.

The Prestige on rewatching falls apart to me. Looks great, but not much else.

Inception was an action film, but the praise it gets is overblown. It is nothing special. 

The sub treats him like he is some sort of Kubrick clone. There are far more important directors (we don't have to talk about arthouse film even) making films right now, far more talented, far more interesting.

I see little difference between him and Snyder or Michael Bay.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, everything I have posted on here someone stole and made into a 5 books series and got movie deals. It was very disheartening. My dystopian YA fantasy vampire thriller was so unique. My vampires didn't even sparkle they glowed! That is the title of the series 'Glow' - you can find it on amazon.

	<TEXT> Penguin and Random House are merely digitizing successful print titles

Which they paid for, edited, shipped and promoted? 

These companies are effectively copyright exploitation factories now

That's a bit drastic isn't it?

 hoping that authors won't wake up to how easy it is to write a book, hire an editor and self-publish.

Most authors are aware of this. Some decide to do it. Others decide not to. From my lurking on here it seems suited to very specific types of books.
