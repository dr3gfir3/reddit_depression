	<TEXT> How does ingame elo have anything to do with whether people vote along the lines of their favorite players or the most skilled players? That's just a personal preference, you can be bronze (or not even have an interest in playing ranked yourself) and still be interested in seeing high level plays, or you could be Diamond and a lot of your interest in the game is thanks to one personality (irrespective of his skill) and you want to see him at the event. Nice shitpost/10. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saved [this](http://puu.sh/lnEqV/68cbe2830b.jpg) when it popped in the client back when they were on top of the standings during summer split. Sometimes I just like to look at it - boy band promo or wha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess partly because Hauntzer's security is conditional on how KaSing does. If KaSing retains his spot (likely) I doubt they'd switch Hauntzer cause there's nobody better in NA (and top has to be NA). So see how KaSing goes and go from there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He wasn't the best but he did play better than Santorin last split. Move carried some of GV's games and was pretty consistent with his vision control if nothing else. Santorin did nothing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. I can't think of a player who IMPROVED (not necessarily the best in the end but the one that got the most noticably better than they were at the start) over last season as Hauntzer, him being young and showing that propensity is a good thing. Remember not every player comes into the scene a star - Sneaky started off not doing anything but playing Ashe so he could ult for the rest for the rest of the team, now he's often considered a top Western AD. </TEXT>
