	<TEXT> Seeing stories like these posted always makes me feel all the feels :') I personally had been dealing with terrible depression for a long time and watching Mindcrack made me feel like for a brief moment, I'm no longer trudging through water and can relax and smile. These guys made me laugh more than I've ever had. </TEXT>

Personally, I love both groups, so as long as they do SOME type of co-op stuff, I'd be happy. </TEXT>
