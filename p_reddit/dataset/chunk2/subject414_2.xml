	<TEXT> Well, not all that useful except to make weird sounds. I wouldn't use it live unless it was for a certain effect and probably no more than a few seconds. It's fun to play around with though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Little Dual is what I used as the SGoS wasn't being made back then. And if you don't need the bells and whistles it would be fine.

I'd love to do an AMA, that sounds like fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's me. I've used the Lehle Dual (and many other Lehle products) with no issues on touring rigs. I used one on Brad Whitford's rig for an entire tour. </TEXT>
