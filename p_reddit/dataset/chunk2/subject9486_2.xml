	<TEXT> Haha thank you, you're too kind. But maybe I'm an amazing philosopher and that's my calling. I actually do have a creative output in the form of a comic I [do](https://www.reddit.com/r/webcomics/comments/3bhupb/canine_scientists_hard_at_work_oc_by/) Thanks for the advice. I'm discussing the possibility of hand lettering in the comments above. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for taking the time. I realize I should have made more effort to differentiate the writing on the blackboard you're supposed to be able to read and that you're not.
Criticism is very helpful to me as I've just started this project. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, I hadn't thought of that. Thank you.

I will try it without hatching. I printed it on a label yesterday though and it came out surprisingly well. I guess it would be smaller than that in some digital uses though. 

Thanks for your help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so I'll preamble with "Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You understand it better but the frog dies in the process." but the basic idea is that we regularly ask dogs "Who's a good dog?" and in this imagined scenario the dogs have taken this question to heart and spent their lives searching for an answer to return to the humans.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Logo] I am not a designer by any means but my mum asked me to draw a logo for her sandwich shop and now I need criticism. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hand drew a [logo](http://i.imgur.com/2qSCbPr.png) for my Mum's sandwich shop. We mostly sell filled baguettes. I plan to add the name of the sandwich shop in arcs above and below the circle and perhaps the date it was established (1998). I recognise that it is a very detailed design. It won't be on the shopfront but may be on flyers, menus, labels and signage inside the shop. The next step is to pay someone else to add text and convert it into a vector image I guess.  


Any help or advice is massively appreciated. I'm doing a philosophy degree and have no idea how logoing works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much. I post them all at facebook.com/subject9486 if you want to keep up to date (also tumblr and instagram if you're a facebook avoider). I haven't tried a paper yet but I plan to try Private Eye (a UK magazine) after a bit of work. I've tried submitting to greetings card companies as well but think they are too controversial for that.  </TEXT>
