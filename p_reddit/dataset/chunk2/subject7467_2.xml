	<TEXT> I dunno mate I'm not from the US so I have an EU point of view. I work in hopitality  and if a guest would ask me for a ham and Swiss I would not understand. 



The fact is that chocolate / cheese making isn't just for Switzerland. So many cheeses in France compare to tiny switzerland. Even the Dutch are making more cheese than Switzerland. And Belgium chocolate is world famous thanks to Congo. In fact in Europe the Swiss are more known for their richness and their neutrality than their food.  So you want your ham rich and peaceful right ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You didnt see this post ? 

Alright :)

Any sugar dough will do for the crust, but I tend to use crusts with almond powder in it. Taste good.

 

Lemon Cream: _220g sugar _4 eggs _3 Lemons (bio is better as you ll need the skin) _300g Butter

First, cut the butter in cubes and let it warm up to room temperature and boil some water in a pot big enough so you can put a heatproof bowl on it but small enough so the bowl is not in contact with the water.

 

Then put the sugar and the zests of 2 lemons (3 if you like it stronger) with the eggs in a bowl that can support heat (84degree Celsius) and mix them with a whisk.

Put this bowl on your boiling water pot and whip well until the mix becomes foamy/creamy, no liquid should remain. Ideally, if you have a thermometer, you have to whip until it reaches 84c.This step is a nice free workout for your arms :) Note that you can do this step simply using a pot, but you ll need to be very careful to whip well and control the heat if you dont want to end up with sweet lemon scrambled eggs.

 

Once it is cooked pass it through a thin strainer to remove the zests and eventual lumps of cooked egg.

Let it cool down to 50/60 degrees C. and add the butter cubes by cubes while mixing with a blender, let the air come in the cream during this step, its better for the creamyness !

Done, let it rest in the fridge for 4h.

 

For the Meringue:

150g egg whites 300g sugar

I advise you to make a Swiss meringue, more easy and best result to be burn with blowtorch.

Mix the whites and the sugar in a pot on slow fire until the sugar is completely incorporated. Use your finger to check, it must be slimy and warmer than you but not too warm or you ll cook the eggs.

Mix it with an electrical mixer with whisk on until its thick and shiny. If you re not ready to pipe it, let it in the mixer at slow speed. If you stop whipping it will become hard and dry.

Pipe it the way you like, I recommend training on a plate before as you can re use the meringue anyway. Then burn it with a blowtorch!

Enjoy !

	<TEXT> I worked in a restaurant where we used to serve creme brulee this way, but we would caramelize it first with blowtorch, then pour a few drops of a very concentrated alcohol perfumed with orange, mint or lemon essence, that way we could propose 3 different flavors with the same mix and it would still burn on the table. I dont remember the name of that thing though, sorry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kitchen guy here, Pastry to be precise. I'm disgusted how tips are shared in some restaurants. Example: I make 3.5k netto and 50 of tips per month. I have 10 years of experience and have been to school for it. A bartender working in the pub next to me makes 3.3k netto + 1k tips. So he gets 4.3k including 1k tax free for serving coffees and beers. I could learn his job in a day. He couldn't do what I do in months of training. Yet he earns 800 more than me. 

I already resigned and I can't wait to start my own business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ve never heard that ganache recipe needed bitterness ingredients.

 Usually coffee (please not instant it's not great quality wise. Better make an expresso with real coffee) is added to chocolate mousse or moelleux to enhance the chocolate taste and add strongest to it but personally I d prefer get a higher cocoa pourcentage by using stronger chocolate or cocoa paste. 

I like to add salt sometimes to chocolate ganache to balance the sweetness though. The hazelnuts s bitterness is needed in the whole pastry because nothing else is bitter in it.  Try the ganache at home it's so easy. 500 ml boiling cream poured in 3 times on 350g milk chocolate 30% mini. Let rest 1 night. Then you whip it until it's creamy. Done ! </TEXT>
