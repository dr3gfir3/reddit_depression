	<TEXT> I just want to share this Kickstarter project by Brother Chris Walters from Living Stone Lodge No. 255 in NY. I can't really support him by pledging (I'm in Canada and they ship to US only) but making a fan art and spreading the word is definitely within the length of my cable tow.

	<TEXT> Hey, was sup, man? I hope all is well. While I'm certainly no Manly P. Hall, I know a few useless facts which may help guide you in finding the answer to your question.

Everything good comes in threes. The Trinity, or the universal mystical number 3 is the sum of [unity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(philosophy) ), that spot on the pyramid occupied by the eye on the back of a dollar bill, where all things emanated from, and [power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(Greek_philosophy)). A triangle is a shape made of 3 points. A triangle is deemed more mathemagical specially if all the sides are equal in length and all the angles measure 60 degrees. 

Good luck with your search for light.

	<TEXT> Whoa. Easy tiger. My apologies, I thought that the design on the shirt plus the fact that I was having lunch actually makes Masonic sense. Also, I was hoping that someone would notice that cool Masonic hat- a gift from my friend D with Grip or Token. They make the most awesome Masonic hats!

Here's a better view (see link below) of the design on that shirt that I'm wearing. I hope that you appreciate the significance of the grain on the background. There's the salt and pepper (black and white, like a particular pavement) shaker with the seven liberal herbs and spices sprinkling out of it too. Spice of life, gotta love it. Did anyone notice the steak in the middle? It's not T bone, but rather a G bone. Get it? What about the tools that form the S C, it's not your usual fork and knife, isn't it? These, the chef knife and the bbq fork, are the tools of those who serve, not merely of those who partake. Finally, before I get flak, yes- it is on the second degree on purpose. Work... Encourage industry... Reward merit... Just some of the words I live by, I learned that from a particular charge from a particular degree.

Anyway, despite having just celebrated my 3rd reddit cake day, apparently, I still don't get reddit. So, my friend, please illuminate me on what is reddit material vs stuff that belongs in Facebook. Or would you be kind enough to direct me to the proper sub for this photo that do not belong? Or maybe I'll just go back to digg. (not)

However, there is a Masonic connection in the sense that I'm showing how the profane may view certain qualities and attributes that we revere. 

If that still don't make sense, then that could only mean that I just don't get what a meme should be. Therefore, speaking as a Canadian Brother, I am truly sorry... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I have already mentioned, I ended up taking the position after much "encouragement" from the Brethren- I agreed but with the understanding that I will not be forced to serve as the WM once I'm done serving as the SW. I have not "bothered" to attend Lodge due to a string of deaths in the family plus the recent birth of my twins who are both afflicted with Peter's Anomaly. I am currently suffering from severe anxiety. Besides what I do in Facebook, I'm unable to work a regular job. Do I feel I'm letting my Lodge down, all the time, but they keep on assuring me that they understand and I'm always more than welcomed to drop by. By the way, if anyone is in Toronto, we have an EA Degree tomorrow 7PM at the Thornhill Masonic Temple, if you got nothing to do, come visit us. I will not sit as the SW but I will deliver the PM charge. :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely not and I didn't want to in the first place. English is not my first language but I have been told time and again that I am quite good with delivering "memorized" (I prefer the term "internalized") speeches. 

I have been delivering all Past Master charges (1,2, and 3) since I was JD. The PMs are impressed and want to see me serve the Lodge as its WM one day. But the thing is I have anxiety problems and I don't think I'm cut to lead. Long story short, I declined the JW position but ended up taking it after much nudging... same thing with SW and now I'm lined up to be the WM next year.  </TEXT>

Do I still feel like a Freemason? Very much so. The officers of my Lodge have been supportive. It also helps that I am managing a Masonic social media page with a lot of awesome Masons who continue to inspire me. I may have been away from Lodge but social media have actually have helped me further my Masonic studies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Brethren,

My apologies for the blatant promotion. I am in need of help and have to make few extra sales. I remember that a couple of Brothers here on /r/freemasonry have previously expressed interest should we ever do a rerun. And so here it is - http://i.imgur.com/txH6XeL.jpg

We are reprinting the stylized SC shirt (above) on black American Apparel tri-blend Short Sleeve Track Shirt http://store.americanapparel.net/tr401.html

And my favourite Sublime Shirt (bottom) on American Apparel's heaviest Jersey t-shirt- the HJ400 Hammer t-shirt. The one shown in the photo is from the first batch- been using it at least twice a week  for about six months now. I machine wash and dry it after each use. It gets better/feels better on the skin with age and the print is still amazing. It's my favourite work shirt and I always wear it with pride. 

The 'Sublime shirt' have four prints. (1) "SUBLIME" on front; (2) "MASON 3 degree" on back; (3) the Plumb tool on the left sleeve; (4) and the Level on the right.

Flat rate prices:

Stylized SC: $32
Sublime shirt: $35

Flat rate shipping and handling:

US/Canada: $12
International: $18

Due to some financial complications, our website is down and will be so for the next few days. But I would like to know in advance if there is still an interest from this group. 

10% discount for /r/freemasonry members.

S F,

	<TEXT> I'm sorry if the question is vague. English is not my first language. In your mind's eyes and ears, when reading comments- do you hear or visualize someone of specific gender? Does he or she speak with a specific accent? Nationality? Do you hear a soccer mom, or a basement dwelling teenager? A young adult about to enter the "real" world or maybe you hear a BBQ loving dad? I hope I'm making sense...

Anyway, as for me, I "hear" the comment with an accent of your typical North American male in his late teens to early twenties. Michael Cera type. College level probably working as a food server (pizza delivery or waiter). Even after they reveal their age to be 60+, or their gender, or profession, I still hear it with this typical boyish accent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Filipino Mason residing in Toronto (also initiated, passed, and raised here but spent most of my youth in the Philippines as a DeMolay)

Masonry is big and commands a lot of respect in the Philippines. Most (if not all) of our national heroes were freemasons. Even the Philippine flag is Masonic (designed by our first president and zealous Freemason Emilio Aguinaldo). Masonry here in North America is more on personal building and philosophy whereas it's more about  brotherhood and charity in my native land. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was baptized as a Christian but I have a different take on the Holy Trinity. To me, the human being is the Holy Trinity. Each and everyone of us is a manifestation of the Divine Truth, a sleeping Buddha waiting to be awakened. 

(1) The Father metaphor is your guide- the nagging conscience that urges us to do the right thing even if no one is looking, it is your super-ego. 

(2) The Son is the material body that will eventually rot and decay. This material body, the id, has many wants and needs and thus very vulnerable to temptation (see: the temptation of Christ). Though the physical body seems to be limiting, it allows us to experience the creation or the universe.

(3) And finally, the Holy Spirit is the life force.

So no, the concept here is not 3 separate Higher Powers. I think the idea is to know yourself and unite all 3 and experience the Divine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Hinduism has multiple Gods."

I'm not Hindu so please take this with a grain of salt... I just thought that the idea is that these multiple gods is just different representations of the Para Brahman (aka ultimate truth). 

To answer your question, yes I believe it's one and the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - "Did operative masons actually use Geometry (hint: no)"

I don't know where you're getting your information from but you won't be able to build magnificent structures without the knowledge of Geometry. 

- "crafstmen were illiterate" 

Not because they cannot read means they don't know about proportions and cannot follow instructions. There's a reason for apprenticeship.  

The charges and lecture are everything you need because it will lead you to further studies and better understanding of yourself. All the history in the world such as the connection between monks and masonry will not mean anything unless you know yourself and you know what real charity is.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Samuel L. Jackson's 300 word monologue </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-05-30 06:46:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Brethren, I'm sure that all of us are intimately familiar with Ecclesiastes 12:1. Don't you think it would be nice to hear Mr. Jackson deliver those lines Ezekiel 25:17 style? 

Here's my contribution: http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1f9x5y/im_samuel_l_jackson_and_ill_record_a_video_of_me/ca8mluc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This post will probably not go anywhere but I secretly and sincerely wish that Mr. Jackson will somehow take notice. Mr. Jackson's most popular lines are laden with profanity (big fan here and I got nothing against that) but I wonder how he will fare when asked to deliver a somber piece without the usual dirty words (I love Ezekiel 25:17).

The following is a poem by Koheleth from the book of Ecclesiastes. The Book of Ecclesiastes itself was described by novelist Thomas Wolfe as "...the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of mans life upon this earth... the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound."

I have selfish reasons why I want you to pick this one but this is also relevant to Mr. Jackson's cause. I hope that we all, especially those who suffer from Alzheimer's and their loved ones, find wisdom in these words through Mr. Jackson's monologue. This poem is just perfect at 234 words long.

"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low; Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. (*the following line is optional*) Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity." </TEXT>
