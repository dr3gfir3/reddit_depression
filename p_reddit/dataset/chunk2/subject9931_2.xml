	<TEXT> It is well known in aerosol science/technology fields that the type of filament used in e-cig devices will slowly turn the filament into nanoparticles. They are termed a glowing wire aerosol generator, and have been used to generate well defined and very small nanoparticles for scientific applications for a long time now. 
A lot of seminal work on this has beendone by Christian Peineke http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850206001133

	<TEXT>  Vaporizers take a flavored liquid and convert it to a vapor that is inhaled.


Not quite, they do initially create a vapour around the filament, but what is inhaled is a liquid aerosol (a bunch of liquid "particles").
E-cig juice has a very low vapour pressure, so the amount of true "vapour" [vapor for Americans] you inhale is negligible.

EDIT: I have done lots of measurements of the particle size spectrum produced by e-cigs, using sophisticated aerosol spectrometers... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are lots of houses/rooms/apartments to rent in East Victoria Park which is walking distance to Curtin and also to train/bus stations. Gumtree is probably the best place to look.
The rental market is pretty good for renters at the moment. Feel free to negotiate if you think the rent is too high. 
That said, finding "pet friendly" rental accomodation is a bit harder. You may be better off finding somewhere to rent first then asking your landlord about a dog later. If you are a good tenant they will be more willing to let you. 
There are lots of good restaurants along albany highway at (East) Victoria Park. Again a (long) walk or a short bus trip from Curtin. </TEXT>

I also predict that self driving cars will mean an increase in motorbike ownership. Riding will be safer since the sensors in cars will always be alert, plus they will be one of the few vehicles not self driving. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. I was trying to keep things simple and generalise the commonalities between AU and NZ. 
e.g. in some states of Australia you just have to provide photos/description and a stat dec that you have a safe. Police have the power to inspect it but rarely do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to clarify - AU/NZ type laws would mean that the average citizen would only need to hand in/give up semi-automatic longarms. However the rest would need either a letter from a property owner saying they have permission to hunt there, or be a member of a target range/club. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I realize this would be unlikely/impossible. Just curious.
FYI, New Zealand and Australian laws allow you to own firearms (including handguns), however you need to have a license/permit, you need to have a genuine reason (hunting / target shooting / professional), and it is difficult or impossible to own semi-automatic longarms unless you are a professional shooter.

	<TEXT> The disappearance of MH370 was linked to the demise of the rover car company. 

Frank Whittle, one of the key jet engine developers originally worked with Rover to develop the first jet engine. Rover management did not get on with Frank, so traded the jet division with Rolls Royce. Rolls Royce jet engines are now the leading manufacturer, and powered MH370, while rover has gone belly up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some information on Australian regulations to make things clearer. Anyone with a "genuine reason" can own A/B/H categories. The genuine reason could be target shooting at a range or club. Categories C and D are limited to professionals shooters and military/law enforcement.

 Category A: rimfire rifles, and single and double barrel shotguns. 
    
 Category B: single shot and repeating centre fire rifles. 

 Category C: semi automatic rimfire rifles with a magazine capacity no greater than 10 rounds; and semi automatic or pump action shotguns with a magazine capacity no greater than 5 rounds. 

 Category D: self-loading centre fire rifles. 

 Category H: handguns. 


 This system is stricter than that of a number of comparable countries. 

 First, and in contrast to the position in the United States, there is no legal right to gun ownership. Owning and using a firearm is limited in Australia to people who have a genuine reason and self-protection does not constitute a genuine reason to possess, own or use a firearm.

 Secondly, the Australian system requires both the licensing of individual shooters and the registration of each firearm. In contrast, countries such as New Zealand and Canada broadly speaking only require shooters to obtain a license, which enables them to freely purchase firearms appropriate to that licence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We (as in surface scientists) have been able to do cool stuff with oil and water droplets for some time, e.g. see ( 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnKemK8UI4M )
however the level of precision in the surfaces we make has been increasing.
For example, we have been making oleophobic coatings in our lab for years using fluorinated copolymers, however the results between phobic and phillic areas are not as nicely controlled as in this study.

The applications are endless. In the past companies like unilever (who make foods and personal care products) funded a lot of this work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note this wasn't a total gun ban, just a ban on semi-automatic longarms (and some others) for recreational users. 
It is a myth that the real number of guns went down as a result of the buyback. About 650000 were destroyed, and Australia has since imported over 1 million. Many of the guns surrendered as part of the buyback were not being actively used or were even inactive. Most active shooters used the buyback money to buy more firearms.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand the FBI have usually used a definition of 3 deaths not in the same family. 
In the 2014 event only one person was shot by the siege perpetrator, the 2nd was shot accidentally by police. 
EDIT - it is worth noting that the weapon used in the siege was a pump action shotgun which was imported prior to 1996 and should have been surrendered as part of the buyback scheme.  </TEXT>
