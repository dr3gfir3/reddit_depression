	<TEXT> So sorry.

This happens all the time, sadly.

My friend lost her weimy the same way.

This is why I do not 'fix' my animals. 

Nor do I do vaccinations after the first 4 months...

20+ years, never lost a dog this way.

Take care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About a month ago, I closed the front door, got into my carport, into my car, and then as I pulled out of the driveway to leave for work, the rear of the car jumped up and went down.

WTF?

I looked in my side mirror, and I saw on the concrete floor of my garage, what looked to be a round hump.

I got out of my 4600 lb EV, and as I approached, I thought "is that a turtle?"

It was. I was horrified. It was resting under the passenger rear tire crevice overnight.

I inspected it for a cracked shell or smashed foot, head, etc.

The bottom shell was what I was concerned about, and it seemed intact.

So I went around the neighborhood, at 7am, asking if anyone knew of someone in the neighborhood with a pet turtle.

One lady had a land turtle, and it was still in the dry aquarium glass of her garage.

Long story short, I am never home, working for a renewable energy company, so my farmer friend, who has a lot of animals, agreed to let me bring it over and put it into one of his aquaponics tubs (minus any fish, as turtles are known to carry salmonella, and anyone handling them, especially kids, need to wash each and every time).

One of my asian friends, got upset at me, as I've had a rough year, and said "don't you know that turtles are good luck?! That was an omen. Why did you give it away!?"
I'm never home.
I don't think its good luck if I selfishly keep it for my luck, and let it die.
I think its good luck if I find it a good home and it lives 50+ years. 
(I looked online and it seems to be a Red Eared Slider, and they live up to 50 years. OMG.)

So now, even though it lives about 20 miles away, I visit weekly, make sure he has aquatic plants, shade, clean water, and fish pellets to enjoy. Here is a pic from today. He/she is about 8" round shell. Might be 9" by now. seems to be growing.

I call him Mr. Turtle, for now. But I don't even know the sex.

Can we decide on a name? I'll post the results.

	<TEXT> Sounds like the one I went to.

Go find another one. Its not easy to find a good one, so research as much as you can. Even do calls and see how they sound over the phone. Ask simple questions like insurance, cost, and areas of specialty, and you should be able to get a feel of their personality and if it sounds like a good fit for you.

Good luck. </TEXT>

Feel guilty not helping, as helping is something we like to do. But they just accept it as a given, and have no gratitude for your help.

You describe all that I have seen as well.

- selfishness

- lack of empathy

$4.99/mo 700 min. on crappy Sprint MVNO.

Its smarter, but slower, than my iPhone 6 that was assigned to me by job. 

Sad they don't do BYOD.

iPhone 6 is $140/mo on Verizon paid by company, and can't even do data and voice simultaneously like it should on GSM carriers...

Not to mention Siri is a bimbo. I hate her. I disable autocorrect. Only gets you in trouble. Potentially. Fired. Divorce. You have to check it carefully...

	<TEXT> Does this belong here?

They have ear tags.

So this is only a transitory reunion.

Don't tell me that they all didn't eventually go to slaughter... </TEXT>

Yes.

YOU need to work on YOUR anger issues.

	<TEXT> So sorry.

I have been thru the same.

Cancer is either poor food, and/or spot on flea meds, like Frontline...

I hope you don't do it to your next pet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you are wrong.

your logic is over 40 years outdated.

CGNF, for example, can revitalize the soil in months, not decades, or centuries, as you incorrectly state.

Do more homework please, for your sake, and the others you incorrectly try to educate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I run into this enough that I now press the reset button on the chromecast next to the usb cable, and then re-run setup, and wifi password, and then name chromecast, and then it all works.

Until the next time it happens again.

This is from my windows notebook. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are constantly eating/drinking something that you are allergic to. That is creating sinus congestion and post nasal drip.

Post nasal drip is a histamine reaction. You need to read up on allergies and also on healthy eating and nutrition.

That is how I prevent my PND from coming back too often.

For me, its peanuts, and dairy. And a few less critical allergens.

I would avoid the OJ and chocolate for a few months, to start. What kind of soup? Can? Homemade? Cream?

Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're doing it wrong, to be blunt.

You need to eat before sundown, drink water, no other drinks or supplements, exercise of some fashion, leg exercises on a chair, get to bed earlier 10pm.

And what are you consuming? Eating? Doesn't sound like your diet is sleep conducive.

Mindfulness meditation during the day and early afternoon should clear your mind and your body. But you are doing things that are counterproductive to the meditation.

Good luck. </TEXT>
