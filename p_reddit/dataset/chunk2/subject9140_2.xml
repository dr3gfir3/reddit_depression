	<TEXT> My point is that morality is an instilled human concept and not one that is universal.

However, almost all human societies have some system of morals (and almost all of them dictate that children are a part of those moral systems I.e. They are covered by them and expected to learn them.) the issues we get into are when those moral systems conflict I.e. relativism.  

For example, female circumcision is a barbaric practice.

In western cultures, this practice is in conflict with our moral system of how children are to be treated I.e. It is a moral violation.  However, for the cultures that practice it, it is not. (Just to be clear, I am one million % against female circumcision)

Net-net: children are covered by moral systems they are born into even if they don't understand them (and adults within that society act in accordance with them)

That said, animals have no moral code to which they are bound (I feel like someone's going to jump in here and correct me but so be it). Similarly, we have no moral obligation under our system of morals to not eat something unless for example you're Hindu (cows). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I feel like I answer the first paragraph, but humor me if you don't mind. Why is it okay for a lion to eat a gazelle?

Your second comment I tried to address with my closing point I.e. Agricultural and livestock treatment.  There are a lot of arguments on all sides. For example, why is eating meat morally unacceptable to vegetarians/vegans but no one ever cites quinoa as morally unacceptable (see link below.). In a modern society, there are pitfalls to everything I.e. It isn't fair to focus on just one and argue the others have no flaws.

I wouldn't (and didn't) argue we eat meat out of tradition. If I ever argue *for* tradition, then I'll assume someone put bleach in my coffee lol

I don't know the specifics on all global methane emissions, but I'm inclined to agree with you re: western beef consumption. My larger point was just that we could put a significant dent in the methane problem without changing what we eat/how we raise it (which is a logical yet morally reprehensible solution)

	<TEXT> You're conflating meat and cows.  

I'm aware human agriculture is the largest source of methane emissions; however, the question isn't whether human agricultural practices have contributed to global warming (which is an obvious yes.)

The original post is a single argument of whether I am morally permitted to eat meat (from any animal not just a cow.)

The analogy I gave another poster was drinking juice. Is it morally acceptable for you to squeeze a fruit and drink its juice? I'm not asking your thoughts on agriculture, GMOs or how fruit is grown. I'm asking are you morally permitted to squeeze a piece of fruit and drink the juice.

The simplicity of the question is what makes it easy to answer.

ThAt said, if your concern is cattle then your next logical question should be, "Is Hinduism morally unacceptable." India has the second highest number of cattle on earth and yet slaughter of cattle is illegal throughout much of the country.

I'm *AM NOT* arguing Hinduism is morally unacceptable, but if you're arguing cattle represent a significant threat to the world, then logically speaking, India represents the second largest individual threat and they don't eat the animal in most cases.

	<TEXT> You're conflating meat and beef. Meat comes from many sources.

If I ask you your thoughts on strictly the consumption of juice I.e. Is it moral okay for humans to extract juice from fruit, then I'm not asking you your thoughts on GMOs or how fruit is grown, produced/obtained to get the juice.  I'm strictly asking "is it morally acceptable for humans to squeeze the juice from a single fruit and drink it"

This is analogous to question being posed my the original poster, simply "is it morally okay for us to eat meat" (holding that thought in a vacuum).

For me, this answer is yes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Global warming is not an outcome of eating meat.

Global warming is an outcome of livestock farming. Sustainability of livestock farming is completely unrelated to the "moral" question of whether consuming animal meat presents a dilemma for humans.

Strictly speaking, I argue that eating meat does not.

Whether our agricultural practices have deleterious effects for mankind is a totally different argument. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "is this nature telling us to eat humans..." falls to the fallacy of many questions I.e. It's presupposing my argument is yes (which it isn't)

My argument is that biologically, we shouldn't ever.  I'm not a zoologist but I don't believe cannibalism is common in the animal kingdom in general (feel free to contradict me, just what I happen to know.)

I'm not sure I understand your second point, but it sounds like you're equating morality in children with morality in animals I.e. You're ascribing the same "rights" to both and implying my behavior towards one should cover both. The ethical rights of animals vs. humans is a very different argument. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would argue pillage and rape are either learned or evolutionary behaviors.  While they may occur in nature, they are not "natural" as I earlier defined it.

For example, I said to another poster that they were conflating procreation and copulation.  To be more specific.

Procreation for humans: penis inserted into vagina and Sperm fertilizes ovum.

Copulation: whatever action is taken to get the penis in the vagina lol. (Strictly sticking with heterosexual sex for sake of ease).

If copulation is consensual, an orgy or rape - they are all the acts that lead to how biological "natural" procreation occurs. I know logically separating the two sounds strange but there is an important distinction to be made because not all heterosexual copulation is intended to lead to procreation. 

I'm not making an ethical argument about whether humans can commit rape because animals do. I'm making a biological argument that humans can eat animals, because all biological signs IMO point to yes.  I know this is posted in philosophy, but this doesn't raise to a philosophical conundrum for me because strict consumption of animals isn't an ethical quandary (to me.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. And I'm not saying ethics/morals don't ever enter the equation. I'm saying before we consider any constructs of a moral argument, first we should look to the natural argument, as "nature" predates moral reasoning. Lastly, biology has put up a barrier irrespective of our own morals.

I can't answer the second question because I don't know how you are defining natural.

Ethically speaking, whether we should eat animals
Does not feel like an open discussion to me.

Whether we should raise animals for harvest, given the massive number of implications that follow, is a very different question.

Inhumane treatment of animals, global warming, etc are all factors in that argument.  But all of those are extrinsic to the basic argument of "should we eat other animals" </TEXT>

Now you're equating human rights with animal rights which is a different topic.

Do animals have an intrinsic right to the same treatment as humans? Or are you arguing, that a disabled human has the same rights as an animal?

CJD is not generally contracted from animals (link 1)

The famous english/Irish Bovine spongiform encephalopathy outbreak was linked back to feeding cows the remains of other cows (cow cannibalism if you will) i.e. The issue of cannibalism being a source of prions disease is not resolved.

Second, you're conflating the act of copulation with procreation.  Female Praying mantises rip off the
Heads of the partners post coitus. While that may be "natural" for them, that is not how your would define reproduction.

Theft is not a quality that can be ascribed to a natural organism. It's an action

	<TEXT> So, I'm going to take a different approach than maker of the video:

He posits that's we don't eat people because it is morally wrong.

I don't disagree as a member of western civilization but there are societies that would (from a ritualistic perspective.) THAT SAID, he ignores another reason that we don't eat people is biological. Consumption of human flesh is linked to infectious prions diseases in humans I.e. There is a sound biological/natural argument against eating other humans.

So, that being the case, is there a similar argument to made for consumption of animals I.e. Is there a legitimate biological outcome whereby eating them explicitly harms humans? As far as I am aware, while overconsumption may be a problem, there is no animal that we can say "eating X animal is definitively tied to killing people."

So, if we accept that as true, then we know nature isn't holding up a stop sign that says "don't eat other animals", why is it okay/do we do it. Here, I will argue is because the answer is because that IT IS natural.  Despite our self-actualization and higher levels of reasoning, we are still part of the animal world and share all the same qualities as the animals we consume I.e. Metabolism,  reproduction etc.

We are not morally bound to not eat animals, especially since I don't believe other animals even have the concepts of morality. 

That said: the treatment of animals we slaughter for food and how humane that slaughter is a worthwhile  (and I know contentious) debate.

For anyone in the tl;dr camp, the potential psychological problems considered by the study were: 

depression, psychological distress/stress, substance use, body image problems, other psychological problems, and negative social functioning (e.g., loneliness)

Obviously all of these are a concern to a psychologist, but the layperson reading this headline will read:

"Men who see themselves as playboys or as having power over women are more likely to have psychological problems"

As 

"Men who think they are better than women are more likely to be sociopaths"

	<TEXT> Every country has sex criminals yes but not every country deals with this:

*The material shows, among other things, the penetration of toddlers, children being tied up, children having sex with animals and children having sex with other children*

To say every country has sex criminals falsely equates all sex crimes as being of the same severity.

For example, in the United States we have "Romeo and Juliet" laws meant to cover cases of statutory rape whereby both individuals are teenagers. My understanding is, based on the age difference between the teens, the law determines whether it meets the measure of a crime (and I believe this varies by state).

If an 18 year old senior in an American high school is dating/sleeping with a 16 year old junior (and that could happen based on ages above), most Americans would not say that rises to a crime BUT their state law may say differently and classify it as statutory rape. Yet, in another state the same age difference may not rise to the level of a crime. Further, all of those laws explicitly exist because application of the general crime of "rape" isn't entire applicable when both individuals give consent.  Ultimately, I think this forces the casual observer to agree sex crimes have levels of severity.

Which brings us back to the Norway situation above.  It is not that sex criminals exist and, as such, the judicial system can handle it. It is that sex criminals that commit *these* type of sex crimes exist and existing laws/imprisonment rules may not adequately address the severity of the crime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "When I was a teenager, I was really scared of losing my virginity. But then I came to understand, heterosexual intercourse just means the insertion of the male sex organ into a receptive, aroused vaginal canal and the distribution of gametes in the hopes of fertilizing an ovum that may become a zygote. Then I thought, well it's really silly to be afraid of the insertion of the male sex organ. Then I wasn't afraid of losing my virginity after that."

	<TEXT> A large number of rich/famous people are only rich/famous for nepotistic reasons.

No matter how much talent you have, it probably doesn't matter if you don't already know someone with some level of fame.

Take Gigi   Bella Hadid. You know why they're famous? Their father is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and known for building luxury residences in LA.

His wife was a star of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (and I wouldn't be surprised if Mohamed Hadid built some of the other homes those housewives lived in).

Or perhaps looks at Nicola Peltz, Michael Bay's eye candy for Transformers 4. She wasn't a random teen that won an audition. She's the daughter of a billionaire fund manager that decided she wanted to be an actress.

This combination of wealth and pseudo-fame overcomes any lack of talent or ability the children may have by getting them in the door.

Apply this same logic to Kate Hudson, Gwyneth Paltrow, all Kardashian-Jenner, Billy Bush, Ben Stiller, Jaden   Willow Smith, Angelia Jolie, Nicolas Cage and soon to include North West and Blue Ivy Carter, etc., etc., etc.

Net-net: Don't bank on rich and famous, if your family isn't already one or the other.

	<TEXT> I would disagree for the exact reason you said: the *commonly* used informal ones.

Having taken logic courses in college I understand and appreciate your larger point, but the way people argue does not usually follow logic. Ultimately, we are talking about logos vs. pathos.

An ad hominem argument is, at its core, a pathos argument.  Donald Trump performed well in the U.S. election not because he was a policy wonk appealing to logic, but because he spoke to people's emotions.

Look at the nicknames alone, "Lil' Marco", "Lyin' Ted", "Crooked Hillary". Irrespective of any logical argument to be made, his responses were ad hominem attacks before he said *anything* that represented his own point of view (and it was clearly highly effective).

Net-Net: All logical fallacies are worth knowing but, in the real world, I don't think formal logic is usually entering the equation.

Judgment Day came anyway. Only instead of a full nuclear assault that eradicated most of life on Earth, it began by taking jobs making shitty clothing in Bangladesh that would be sold by Kanye West.Then it expanded to Beyonc's clothing line. Then Nike. Until finally it spread to luxury goods like Prada and car factories like Mercedes Benz. By the time we knew what happened it was already too late.  We estimate that within 200 years the machines will put everyone out of work and Skynet will takeover with its army of sewing machines, machine presses and rivet guns."

State rights are nice and good, but this is an area where a federal law that states "this is what you need to vote" would eliminate a lot of headaches e.g. Voting rights act issues, concerns about voter fraud, etc. I know that's an oversimplification to some degree because challenges would still occur but something as consequential as voting should have universal requirements (and it should also be a federal holiday...because fuck it I want another vacation day!)

The internet certainly makes it difficult (since interpreting satire is near impossible), but I honestly believe every American wants America to succeed.

The challenge arises in how we define success.

I disagree with trump on many things but I know he also wants America to succeed. The trick for him, and it would have been the same for Clinton, is to forge a path where all Americans believe they are reaping the rewards of that success.

The problem is that people today only qualify their success as a "success" if the other side of the aisle "fails."  Politics isn't supposed to be binary. It's supposed to be about compromise.  But since most politicians are lawyers, and lawyers get paid to make their point, compromise seems to be a measure of last resort for the US government. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL. Touch. 

That said, unlike most people, I recognize the president (meaning any US president) is not vested with unilateral authority in many regards.

Do I think more socially conservative policies will come to pass? Probably.

Do I think regulations will be rolled back and big business will benefit more than regular citizens? Almost certainly.

Do I think draining the swamp will happen? Definitely not.

You're clearly a Trump supporter and I'm actually not well represented by any party. That said, I think we can both agree the US political system is fundamentally broken. If Trump can bring about positive change for his supporters without pushing down his detractors, then that's fantastic and I hope he does.

A rising tide is supposed to lift all ships. Populism by definition is supposed to be about the people I.e. Regular people as opposed to elites. Whether you're working class and white or working class and Muslim, you should be represented by a populist president. If Trump can be a truly populist president, then that's great for America.

Since the man is yet to even be sworn in, it's unfair to judge him from a presidential perspective.

All of that said, the action cited above by Obama is also a populist move. This is an action that protects indigenous people that have been victimized by America for centuries. If you're populist, then you have to applaud this action. Job creation does not outweigh the right to your home. And if you disagree with that, then allow me to propose an analogy: eminent domain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as checking on being registered to vote, that depends on your state. For example, I live in Pennsylvania and there is a website I can go to that allows me to check my voter status. Unfortunately, not every state works the same way so I can't give you a blanket answer of how to check.  That said, if you google your state name and register to vote, it will probably lead you to either an 800 number or email address that can tell you your registration status.  I think some states sign you up to vote just by getting a driver's license, so it really is luck of the draw based on where you live.

As per the pay you get from jury duty.  Jury duty is a legal requirement and, unless you give the court a valid reason why you can't attend juror selection, you will get in legal trouble. (If you can provide a valid reason you'll be excused).

Your employer is required by law to allow you to attend jury duty as it is a civic duty. At my previous employers, people on jury duty were paid like any other work day and the pay given for jury duty was essentially paid to the employer. This offsets the fact that they have to pay you, but you aren't working. But again, and I can't stress this enough, unless your job is a legitimate reason why you can't attend juror selection (e.g. You travel for work and you will be out of the country working...remember they always call more people than they need), your employer can't just say "you can't go to jury duty because I said so"

Anything that goes to trial gets a jury. Generally speaking: traffic court, small claims court and family court won't have a jury (to my knowledge.) If an actual crime was committed (e.g. Not illegally parking...that's not really a crime in the sense I mean it) and no settlement occurs, then it will go to a jury trial.  

Finally, as per pros vs. cons, there are no pros to jury duty. That's why they call it duty. It is your responsibility as a member of society under the bill of rights to ensure your fellow man is given the right to a trial with a jury of his peers (I think it's the 7th amendment). Because it is a constitutional right, we uphold it and do what is required. Because it's generally boring, most people hate it.  That said, if you're ever falsely accused of something, you'll be real happy other people are performing their civic duty! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But maybe I win the lottery because I'm supposed to win the lottery SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I found this thing.

If I found it, and that was my question, then I can't possibly cause a paradox because the all knowing 8 ball of the future already has the answer to my question.

The future course of events is immutable and I, mega millions winner, is a predetermined event by virtue of having found the toy with the winning numbers. By not giving me the numbers, the magic 8 ball is changing the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They would try to exclude anyone that might be biased.

It could go way beyond race.

For example, if the white guy was in the knights of Columbus and the Asian guy was a teacher, the prosecutors would look to exclude any jurors that are KoC members and defense would look to exclude to teachers, for fear of biases.

As part of jury pool, they outright ask you, "are there any reasons you don't believe you can objectively provide a verdict on the case" (paraphrasing).

Now, people can lie but I believe that can open the door to a mistrial due to juror misconduct I.e. The case is thrown out/retried with a new jury. </TEXT>

No group of people have been mistreated more in the U.S. than indigenous Americans. This is the LEAST our government can do.
