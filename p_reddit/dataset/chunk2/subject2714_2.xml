	<TEXT> I'm on 2mg of Risperidone for Psychosis.  
I hate being on my medication because a part of me is missing.  
I miss the voices, mood swings, unreality and the stress.  
I miss the suicidal and I definlty miss the self-harm.  
Luckily I'm at College and I get stressed easily, so I'm gonna get worse. I've already started cutting again.  
But it's not enough. I hate being on my meds, I really really hate it, I wish they would just let me suffer.  
I deserve to suffer, I don't deserve all the love and concern.  
My boyfriend is going to talk to my therapist to see if my meds can be increases, I'm going to see if they can get decreased.  
I love my family and my boyfriend and his family, but they can all fuck off to high hell for this. I hate this, and I defintly hate myself for letting them get away with this. FUCK. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I posted here yesterday.  
I had a stationary set that I bought a few weeks ago for College. My boyfriend knows my arms have been incredibly itchy and my voices want me to cut.  
I was going to break the sharpener open today while he was out,  but now he's taking the sharpener away from me while I was in a blankout.  
Now I'm incredibly pissed because he won't tell me when he hid it. But he's still going out today, so I told him I'm staying home so I can go up to Tesco to get another sharpener, he can't stop me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 7 months clean. I suffer from Psychosis and SH,  this started when I was 12, I'm 20 now.  
I started College last week and I'm already under stress. The main cause of this is Danny,  the guy who was regularly sexually assaulting me last year did it again on Monday,  and I had to meet a whole group of new people who's already made friends, I was a late starter so I can't make friends, doesn't surprise me, who would want to be around me?  
Anyways, Danny has triggered my PTSD which has gone to one blankout every few weeks to an hour long blankout a day, which my boyfriend had to deal with as I'm staying with him, he shouldn't have to put up with me. I've also been getting more depressed recently.  
I made plans to hurt myself this week, but now I can't because my sister wants to go swimming on Saturday .
I NEED TO CUT NOW.

The reason today was hell was my voices were trying to get me to kill myself and I didn't have enough time to, and I was getting big moodswings and also headaches, I get headaches if I don't take my meds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suffer from Psychosis . I hear voices,  they are very negative voices that tell me I'm worthless, no-one would miss me if I'm gone, that I'm fat, eating too much, to kill myself etc...
I'm on meds and in therapy,  I tried to stop my meds about a month ago, lasted 3 weeks then made plans to go to a bridge.
Then my boyfriend texted my Dad to let him know of my plans, so I'm back on my meds, which I'm not happy about.
This might seem weird but I miss my Psychosis.
I miss the mood swings, voices,  unreality and breakdowns,  I especially miss my suicidal side.
All of that seems so natural, I've been dealing with it for years, and now it's gone. Part of me is missing. I should be dealing with all that.
It's unnatural for me to be on meds.
I think the reason I'm posting this is my parents forgot to make me take my meds, which they have to do otherwise I won't take them, and I didn't remind them. Today has been HELL but I've realised how much I miss it. 
Fuck it, I'm going to kill myself either way. 
Sorry for the wall of text and formatting, on mobile. 
I'm also sorry for wasting everyone's time, I don't deserve to live. </TEXT>

I suffer from Psychotic Episodes. I did take meds but I stopped them too fast without consulting my therapist and now I have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms.  
I hear voices all the time, they are constantly belittling me and putting me down, telling me to hurt myself and kill myself.   
My family knows I'm getting worse but they don't know how worse.   
My boyfriend knows about my mental health problems but my voices aren't letting me be honest with him anymore.  
On Monday I'm going to buy a box, climb over the barrier, call my family and let them know what I'm about to do, call my boyfriend and hope he doesn't talk me out of it again and let him know too, then jump.   
I've been in this place many times before, and now it's time to end it. Let's hope I'm not a coward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had it with College, my work experience and my whole life.  
I'm too stressed, can't get a break from the fucking voices, even with my meds. My family have no idea how much cutting helped before they made me stop.  
What I'm doing Wednesday is stabbing myself, slitting my wrists open and jumping in front of a train if I'm not a coward. But I am. Which is why I need to get drunk beforehand but I'm stupid and have no ID.  
The pushing point has been my ex doesn't know the meaning of the word no and likes to molest me. Godammit.  
My family and my boyfriend has tried their hardest to help, but overall it's become too much.   
This is also going to be my suicide note now so thanks to my family and Michael for trying.  
Please keep a very close eye on Michael, he said he can't live without me so   
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, DO NOT LET HIM DIE  
Hmmmmm what else can I put  
I've never got over the fact I was molested as a kid, been having bad nightmares about that.  
There is something else but I'd rather cut that into my body because that's what I've realised I am.  
Goodbye and thanks for everything :)  
I'm so so so sorry too.

Very structured and had all the appropriate support and programs to continue.  
But on the other hand, my Mum has been in hospital for 3 years in 4 different hospitals, and have had a different experience in each of them, so it differs for everyone.

	<TEXT> Background: I'm a 19 year old College Student under stress that suffers from Psychosis and PTSD. 
I sometimes get these episodes of extreme emotional distress after being triggererd by something insignificant.  
Today it was me mixing up train times. These episodes usally last 10 mintues to half an hour.  
This is what usally happens in them:  
I get shaky.  
I get extremly upset on the verge of tears.  
I find it hard to calm down. 
I feel extremly suicidal and I need to hurt myself.  
I feel like I could explode.  
I either pace around or can't move.  
I tend to talk to myself and put myself down in these episodes   
E.G "I'm so fucking stupid why don't I jump under a fucking train"   
After these episods it usally takes me a week to recover and to function normally, it messes up my Collegework, my Psychosis get worse, my sleeping, eating, focus, my suicidal impulses ect.

	<TEXT> I've been diaganosed with Pyscosis and I'm on Abilfy for 5mg which has helped with my hallcinations and rapid moodswings I was having every few minutes with no cause, but I was wondering about this other thing.   
It's happened 3 times in 2 months and this recent one started on Monday. I'll try to be as clear as I can.  
I can't tell what I'm feeling, or I feel extremely great and bad at the same time.  
I feel like I could do verything at once E.G clean the house in 15 minutes or create a sympothy but I do get better at the keyboard during these periods  
I can't concerntrate at one thing for very long, this has taken me 20 minutes to type out.  
My self-harm and suicidal thoughts increase a lot during these periods but at the same time I feel extremely happy.  
I talk more rapidly and need less sleep.  
and more recently, heighted senses  
These periods usally last for 4-5 days.  
Advice?

	<TEXT> Ok, most of that sounds like me. At the moment I keep switching from feeling really great and feeling really bad in a matter of minutes, but even in the times I feel really great it feels like I need to stab myself at the moment.  
I'll try to but that and the suicidal bit is the hardest things for me to talk about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, do you mind me asking what is it a part of and how it affects you?  
I've never felt like this before so I have no idea what's happening.  
I'll try to mention it when I next see her which will be Monday, she's driving me to my psychiatrists appointment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted here a couple weeks ago. For more info you can find that post [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2nkixk/i_feel_like_im_going_insane/)  
There has been some new symptoms and I have no clue what to do about them or why they are there. Sorry about bothering you again but I need to figure this out.  
For the past 3 days I have been feeling great and depressed at the same time, feeling a lot more irritable, I've been behind on my assigments for College but it feels like I could do all of them at once.  
It feels like my moods are changing rapidly as well. 
I haven't told my therapist any of this as it's only been 3 days and I don't know if this is important or not. </TEXT>
