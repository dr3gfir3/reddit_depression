	<TITLE> [UPDATE] Just got back from the Dr. and she practically recommended Paleo to reverse my Per-Diabetic high blood sugar! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-01-11 20:10:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I posted [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/16ah1z/started_paleo_about_2_weeks_ago_going_to_the_dr/) about dreading talking to the Dr about shifting to Paleo to lose weight when she called me in to talk about my (completely unrelated to starting Paleo) high blood sugar and high cholesterol. Turns out my blood sugar was only slightly elevated, but due to my family history of diabetes, she wanted to talk to me about how to make changes to stop from becoming diabetic, get my cholesterol down, and counteract my anemia. She told me to cut out carbs, use butter, olive or coconut oil, and eat lots of meat and vegetables. I asked, wearily, if she meant like the Paleo diet...and she said YES! That's the best diet for you to both lose weight and get the blood sugar and cholesterol under control. I was worried for nothing, and now even more sure that the choice to eat Paleo and get my fat ass moving are**the** changes that are going to change my life and health. Thanks to everyone who gave me tips and inspiration. I am now twice as committed to get healthy.
*EDIT I forgot to mention I lose 3 lbs in 7 days! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just started Paleo and Couch to 5k to lose weight. I went to the Dr. last week and had a full work-up. Got a call today that my tests came back and the Dr. wants to see me Friday morning to "discuss my blood sugar and high cholesterol". I have never had issues with blood sugar or cholesterol, despite my weight. I feel that Paleo is the way to go, and think it will help the Diabetes, but how likely is it that my Dr. would be on board, and if not do I just do what I want anyway? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the things I've done right in my life was to really live it up in my 20's. Clubs, trips, strip joints, party weekends that started on Thursday, hook-ups...crazy times. I feel like I got it all out of my system and got engaged after I started slowing down on the party times. Waited 2 years after we got married to have kids so we could just be a couple for a while. I watched a lot of my friends settle down and start families too early and go through the Quarter Life Crisis bit to do all the shit they "missed out on". They ruined their marriages, lives, and in one case have really screwed up a kid emotionally by saying selfish and inappropriate things to a young child. (i.e. "Having you ruined my life" etc) I tell anyone who will listen to live the shit out of your 20's and get it all out of your system, it's really the only time of your life you can be that irresponsible and selfish and not fuck your life up completely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On Monday I prepared everything for a weeks worth of salads with chicken, avocado, onion, cucumber and celery. I have had it for lunch every day this week and am eating one as I post this. I Drank the last soda in the house 2 days ago and won't be buying more. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/i2dLRh.jpg) is what my ingredients and assembled salad look like. My plan is to grab different veggies each shopping trip to throw in the mix and keep it interesting. The good thing is I live pretty far from any fast food so it's easier to make a salad then pack up my 3 yr old and hit a drive thru. I don't know if I lost any this week, but I sure feel good! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is where I am at 37. I see my mom with my children and realize that if I don't make positive changes RIGHT NOW I will not live to be there for my grandkids someday, or if I make it to my mid 60's I will be no where near as active or healthy enough to enjoy them if I just keep getting fatter. I have to get my shit together for myself and my family. I have taken the first steps, and have a Dr appt. tomorrow to get a little more input about how to proceed. As I said on the intro thread, this has to be the time I make it happen, I'm running out of time. Best of luck to you as you fight the good fight, I hope we both are reaping the sweet progress pics karma in the coming months! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always jump in, over do it, and quit, so I am going to start with tracking my calories, then slowly cut my intake down. As far as exercising, I have been pretty sedentary the last few months due to anxiety and depression issues so I am going to just MOVE for the first little bit, then add in more structured exercise. At my size, any change reflects on the scale. In the past I would always exercise way past my fitness level, get hurt, and stop so I really want to start slow and steady. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all! 37/F currently 311 at 5'8'ish. Dr has told me I would be great at about 190. His comment was "You are very muscular under there, you would look like Xena Warrior Princess if you got between 190-175." So I would like to test the theory. Losing about 120 would get me in that range, and when I get there I can see if I want to go further. I have started this journey MANY times since I was about 11 and I need so badly for this to be the time I make it happen. I have seen so many awesome success stories and pix, I hope we will all be the next batch of Redditors posting about reaching goals! </TEXT>
