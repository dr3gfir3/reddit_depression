	<TEXT>  The other one is that marriage is "defined" as being between a man and a woman, so if you change it it's not marriage.

Of course that's completely circular and beside the point.

I agree that this is a bad argument as presented, but I think there might be a miscommunication going on here with the use of the word "defined".

When people say "marriage is *defined* as being between a man and a woman", they might not be referring to the current legal definition of some country. Rather, they are making the claim that marriage is not merely a social construct but something which is, by its nature, between a man and a woman. 

And so they are saying that marriage is "defined" in this latter sense, as being between a man and a woman, and that consequently the law should reflect that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't define "same sex marriage." It's just marriage that is applied equally to all citizens of legally met age for marriage within that society or state.

Again, that's just question begging: if marriage isn't merely a social construct, and is by it's very nature between a man and a woman, then you cannot "apply it equally".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are trying to persuade who believes in some position "A", but disbelieves in another position "B" merely saying "A is similar to B in that both propose a narrower legal restriction of something than some other views. Therefore, to be consistent" is inadequate. 

You yourself probably hold some views that  propose a narrower legal restriction of something than other views, but I don't think you'd take the statement "You're just like those who want to legally restrict marriage to separate races" as a convincing argument in these situations.

What needs to be done is to discuss how the two cases are actually analogous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I would ask the rector to stop associating marriage equality to polygamy (and while we are at it: let's throw in beastaility and incest).

In previous discussions on /r/Australia, I've had supporters of same-sex marriage happily concede that their view **does** inevitably lead to polygamy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Claiming that people are "denying equality" presupposes precisely what is in question:

If you are correct that marriage is between two people, then traditional marriage proponents are denying peoples rights.
If we are correct that marriage is between a man and a woman, then nobody is denying anything when they seek for that to truth be upheld in the law.

As an analogy, imagine if I saturated the media with the question Why do same-sex marriage proponents want to lie about what marriage really is?

Presumably you would answer something to the effect of Well, I dont think Im lying, I think that I have the true view of what marriage is, and I want the law to reflect that. You can clearly see how this begs the question i.e. presupposes that my position is true. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Revisionists may have profound intellectual doubts about a transcendent deity, the unique Incarnation of the eternal Son of God, the resurrection of Jesus, and a trustworthy written witness to divine revelation; but they have no doubts whatsoever about abortion rights, homosexual marriages, identifying deity in female terms, the evils of American military power, and the moral necessity of never permitting a congregation to leave the institutional church with its assets. Beneath the veneer of inclusivity and tolerance, there lies the cobra that will defend its territory at all costs and will expend all its energy and wealth to extend that territory.*

Given that there are 4 standard nucleotides, and assuming a random distribution of nucleotides in the sequence, the probability of getting a given 4 nucleotide sequence will be (1/4)^4, and for a 5 bp sequence it will be (1/4)^5,
and thus our answer is "4 times as many". </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The technical definition is same basic structure, different function

Right, so we've got some people who think the "technical definition" is one thing, and we've got others, including one of the most prominent biologists of the 20th century who thinks something different. If you read the link, then you'll see the same definition is used by Douglas Futuyma in
his widely used textbook "Evolution". This isn't some eccentricity of Mayr's.

 Responding to my point with "well this other guys says something different" does nothing to address the point I made.

You explicitly claimed **"Common ancestry is not part of the definition."** I'm disputing that statement. 

I was under the impression that we were discussing the issue

I think whether multiple incompatible definitions of homology have been used *is* the issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Common ancestry is not part of the definition

No less than Ernst Mayr, in his book "The Growth of Biological Thought" wrote: "The term *homologous* existed already prior to 1859, but it acquired its currently accepted meaning only when Darwin established the theory of common descent. Under this theory the biologically most meaningful definition of homology is "A feature in two or more taxa is homologous when it is derived from the same (or a corresponding) feature of their common ancestor".

That's not to say that others haven't used the word in other senses, but there are certainly numerous biologists who have used the word to mean "characteristics which are derived from a common ancestor".

	<TITLE> Circular reasoning in evolution? (x-post /r/Creation) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-16 11:36:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Theres a wonderful volume titled Galileo goes to Jail and other Myths about Science and Religion published by Harvard University Press, and one of the "myths" is That the theory of organic evolution is based on circular reasoning, authored by Nicolaas Rupke.

Rupke himself is an interesting person: he is currently a historian of science, but initially trained as a geologist and was also a Young-Earth Creationist in his younger years. Alas, he lost his faith when he entered Princeton Universitys doctoral program in geology. His essay deals with both the geological column and homology, but this post concentrates on the latter.

Heres a section from Rupkes essay:

In Icons of Evolution (2000), [Jonathan] Wells discusses why
much of what we teach about evolution is wrong. One of the
icons he cites, conventionally used as proof of evolution, is
the phenomenon of homology. But what precisely is homology?
Wells asks. Under the heading Homology and circular
reasoning, he explains that evolutionary biologists define the
term as the similarity between different species that is due to
their shared ancestry. In other words, homology indicates evolution
and evolution produces homology  a perfect circular
argument.

*Consider the example of bone patterns in forelimbs, which Darwin
regarded as evidence for the common ancestry of the vertebrates.
A neo-Darwinist who wants to determine whether vertebrate
forelimbs are homologous must first determine whether they [the
species being compared] are derived from a common ancestor. In
other words, there must be evidence for common ancestry before
limbs can be called homologous. But then to turn around and argue
that homologous limbs point to common ancestry is a vicious circle:
Common ancestry demonstrates homology which demonstrates
common ancestry.*

It becomes no easier for the DarwinistsWells maintains
when they turn to the fossil record to help determine evolutionary
relationships. *Unfortunately, comparing fossils is no more
straightforward than comparing live specimens... Any attempt
to infer evolutionary relationships among fossils based on
homology- as- common- ancestry soon leads to a tangle of circular
arguments from which there is no escape. *

Some evolutionists have talked back in an effort to absolve
themselves from the sins of chasing their tails. But this has
proved no easy matter. Creation scientists arent fools and,
**strictly speaking, do have logic on their side in the major cases
cited here.** Moreover, they have been able to amass quotations
from concerned evolutionists who apprehensively admit to the
illogical practices of which they stand accused. Quite likely,
a variety of paleontologico- stratigraphical studies are unreliable
because they are founded on a petitio principii (the logical fallacy
of begging the question).

All the same, the assertion that evolution is crucially based on
circular arguments is a myth."

(citations removed, my bolding)

Rupke goes on to discuss how the term homology was originally coined by Richard Owen, an English anatomist, in his book On the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton. For Owen, a homologue was defined as The same organ in different animals
under every variety of form and function., which Owen, as an old-earth creationist, interpreted as evidence of a repeated divine design. Rupke also notes that Owen later began to become more open to a theistic evolutionary view point.

Rupke also discusses how Darwin himself took these observations about vertebrate skeletons, and argued that they were characteristics derived from a common ancestor. Darwin argued in the 14th chapter of the Origin of Species that, for example, because there is no functional reason for the pentadactyl limb to be shared by humans moles, horses, porpoises, bats, therefore it was better explained by descent with modification. 

My comment: I think Rupke is correct insofar as, even if you have some disagreements with it, you can follow the structure of Darwins argument concerning vertebrate skeletons, and the argument itself certainly isn't circular.

However, I think the problem lies in that we have examples of biologists using both definitions of the term homology, creating a circular argument.

Jonathan Wells remains correct in calling this out.

	<TEXT> Neither for Origen nor Augustine was there anything prior to the theological. But for many modern Christians, the implicit authority is science and their reading of Scripture is made in light of that authority.

I may be misunderstanding you, but I don't think what you're talking about is true: I think it's more common for creationists to believe based on what Scripture seems to say, not because it is thought that some overwhelming case from the natural sciences can currently be made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simultaneously, however, Christians begin buying into the implicit claim that the natural sciences are the best way to know anything is true - and since the Bible is true, it must also accord with the natural sciences.

I disagree, because I think there's a big stream of Reformed-style presuppositionalism in creationism, which emphasises science being epistemologically subsequent to and dependent on theology/philosophy.

As for the claim that, with considerations of genre/metaphor etc. taken into account, the Bible won't contradict the findings of the natural sciences, isn't that just the kind of thing that's found in 
things like Dei Verbum and the Syllabus of Errors? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Your argument is weak to begin with because these examples, regardless of how appropriate it is to compare them, are not enough evidence on which to build a representative picture of two groups of scientists.

I recognise that, there's a legitimate concern in that it is just the nature of the case that, because of the sheer scope of biology, you aren't going to have just a handful of "knockdown" pieces of evidence.

But I guess I get a bit frustrated that 
when people ask "What's a good book to read that gives some really good arguments for why evolution is true?" Coyne's 
book is very frequently recommended (e.g. [the recommended books on /r/evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/wiki/recommended/reading).)

And then, if you get somebody to concede that serious errors are present in works like this, suddenly Coyne seems to be a lot less important, and you can't
judge the field based on one book and so forth... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me try to demonstrate my approach with the following example:

http://blog.drwile.com/?p=1309

One often hears that, to be a creationist, one must hold that "scientists are engaged in a conspiracy", and that to reject the consensus of biologists in this area, while simultaneously accepting the fruits of mainstream science in other areas is intellectually inconsistent.

I know it's only one example but I don't think this is nitpicking some obscure paper: surely in a popular book in which you want to persuade people "Why Evolution Is True" and textbooks, experts should present the strongest, most unambiguous examples for their position. And if isn't happening, then I think this is telling.

Consider William Harvey's summary of his groundbreaking studies on the heart. Harvey wrote:

"*It has been shown by reason and experiment that blood by the beat of the ventricles flows through the lungs and heart and is pumped to the whole body. There it passes through pores in the flesh into the veins through which it returns from the periphery everywhere to the centre, from the smaller veins into the larger ones, finally coming to the vena cava and right atrium. This occurs in such an amount, with such an outflow through the arteries and such a reflux through the veins, that it cannot be supplied by the food consumed. It is also much more than is needed for nutrition. It must therefore be concluded that the blood in the animal body moves around in a circle continuously and that the action or function of the heart is to accomplish this by pumping. This is only reason for the motion and beat of the heart.*"

I suppose my question to you would be where, in Harvey's work, a modern textbook, or even a popular account of the cardiovascular system by an expert can we find examples as bad, as ambiguous, as Coynes lanugo argument being used to defend this conclusion? 

When somebody says *Nothing in cardiovascular physiology makes sense except in the light of the view pioneered by Harvey* I don't think there are any analogous faults in the evidence provided.

Whereas, when somebody says "*Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution*, bloopers like Coyne's abound.

I guess it's this kind of thing that leads me to feel comfortable in that, if I ever need heart surgery, I'll trust the consensus of mainstream science, and that considering the history of life on earth, I dissent.

Addendum:

Just to preempt the [common objection](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB360.html) "so what if lanugo has *some* function? That's still compatible with it being vestigial". 

While there is a grain of truth to this objection, in that one frequently encounters formulations of this kind of argument which describe the characteristic in question as having "less efficiency than wed expect or something similar, rather than saying "no function", I still think it's true that we also find the latter formulation as well.

In this case, Coyne says that "theres **no** need for a human embryo to have a transitory coat of hair." and I think there being functional reason for lanugo effectively answers his argument.

	<TEXT> I disagree with the narrative that "ID=creationism", and here's a few examples showing why:

It seems to me that, in the 1980s, a number of thinkers began to emphasise Look, these kinds of arguments from design *can* be decoupled from any particular religious system. Why not just assess them on those grounds?. 

Fred Hoyle, the irreligious English astrophysicist and scientific maverick suggested that abiogenesis was scientifically impossible, and that life arrived on earth by being seeded from outer space. 

*"if one proceeds directly and straightforwardly in this matter, without being deflected by a fear of incurring the wrath of scientific opinion, one arrives at the conclusion that biomaterials with their amazing measure of order must be the outcome of intelligent design."* (Fred Hoyle, Evolution From Space 1981)

In 1986, the Oxford Union held a debate on the proposition That the doctrine of creation is more valid than the theory of evolution. Arthur Wilder-Smith, an English chemist and pharmacologist debating for the creationist side, remarked 

*The scientific creationist says that you need, above natural law, extrinsic information. He does not specify where youre going to get it from. He believes, with Noam Chomsky, that the origin of information, because its a surprise effect, is not attackable by the human brain, and I believe the same. Second thing is that the religious creationist, and I dont speak tonight as a religious creationist, I speak as a scientific creationist, I didnt come here to teach Madame President or anybody else anything about religious creation. I say, from a scientific point of view, you must have, as Hoyle has pointed out, a source of information, surprise effects, acting on inorganic matter in order to do it. The religious creationist says God did it or Allah did it or Yahweh did it or Jesus Christ did it. Im not talking about that, Im saying from a scientific point of view, the scientific method is to add extrinsic information to the system in order to get out an order which isnt intrinsic to inorganic matter.*

In 1984, Lane Lester, Professor of biology at Liberty University, and Ray Bohlin, a doctoral student in molecular biology at the University of Texas, Dallas, published The Natural Limits to Biological Change. While the book was published by Zondervan, a Christian publisher, the first seven chapters of the book merely survey and critique evolutionary biology. The eighth chapter presents Another Alternative. The authors remark *Design in nature has been a topic of debate for centuries. We have no intention of trying to argue conclusively on a philosophic basis that intelligent design disproves any evolutionary theory. Rather, we hope to show briefly by example that the need for intelligence in bringing about the various designs in nature is by no means a preposterous proposition.* They go on to say that, in attempting to describe the limits to biological change, this is *essentially the creationists concept of the created kind.* And I think they argued that simply because their idea fitted in with biblical creationism, didn't mean it was reducible to it.

In 1984, Thaxton, Olsen and Bradley published "The Mystery of Life's Origin", a text widely regarded as a seminal work in the ID movement.

Note that all of these examples are dated *before* Edwards vs. Aguillard in 1987, the case which prohibited the teaching of creationism in the US, and which allegedly was responsible for the modern ID movement according to many. So I don't think this popular narrative of "ID was just designed to get around constitutional requirements after Edwards vs. Aguillard" is quite accurate.

I will concede that there is a lot of conceptual overlap between ID and creationism, and it seems that a creationist textbook ("Of Pandas and People" ) was rejigged to become an ID textbook after Edwards vs Aguillard, but I think that this is just one point of data, and can't be used to characterise the whole issue. </TEXT>
