	<TEXT> I did, twice.  Did an internship the second time I came back and got the usual "thanks but we can't afford to keep you on" spiel. Either I'm just very unlucky or I'm an obnoxious arse in the workplace! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't talk to me about earning potential. I have three third level qualifications, have applied for over 100 jobs, had two recruitment specialists review my CV, etc etc etc. 

Basically it's not a good time to be job hunting, let alone to be talking about earning the actualy money!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems to me the bass is a bit flat sounding. Could be some build up of frequencies interfering with each other. 
Also the noise at :40 is a bit piercing. I'd bring it down in the EQ and maybe no showcase it so much in the song as it doesn't add too much value to the track.

Overall I like this track though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice guitar. I've been a fan of Chapman and his YouTube antics for a while. This tone is pretty much spot on too. I'm not a fan of it, but you mimic it greatly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually have a degree in biological science and experience in pharmacology and neuropharmacology, and have close relations with some peers who work in policy. 

We are well aware of what is out there. I could go into the benefits of legalisation of all drugs, but I shall refrain as it wasn't asked. 

I will say however (and it is an odd reaction) that for some reason when people hear the word "legalise", they associate it with "available on every street corner". We are advocating legalisation with heavy regulation in attempt to support people with the disease of addiction, and to reduce crime. An example of what I mean would be heroin, still used in English hospitals, or perhaps even digitalis, commonly prescribed everywhere. These drugs are legal but heavily restricted. 

On the Krokodil point. If users had access to unadulterated products from clinics, taken in the supervision of medical professionals, with the goal of full recovery (such as heroin in Switzerland), drug use would in fact reduce, and Krokodil use would fade. </TEXT>
