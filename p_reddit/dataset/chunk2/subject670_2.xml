I'm ok with the color pie violations for flavor reasons, but the set is clearly unbalanced in blue's favor. 

I also did not like the vanilla 1/1's. Could you not have made them [Icatian Javelineers](http://magiccards.info/me2/en/15.html) or something?

The mono-colored lands were pretty bananas. I would be first picking them even if I was not in their colors since all of the activations are colorless. The one that lets you draw a card for 2 every turn? Or tutor for a guy for 2 every turn? Crazy.

There was very little to proliferate other than planeswalkers. If you going to make a recurring mechanic like that it would be better to make it more useful. Maybe have the cards also add a counter to something themselves and then proliferate. </TEXT>

"Access to all five of Mirrodin's mana-rich suns has led to diversification and disunity, damaging the Phyrexian singularity of purpose. Of all the energies Mirrodin introduced to the Phyrexian ethos, the mana from the red sun has been most challenging, because it's the force that lies behind the concepts of individualism, compassion, emotion, and freedom."

Also, I have no doubt if you'd spent all your paper money as a youth on silver instead of baseball cards you would have more paper money now, but that would have been true if you bought stock in Microsoft or Apple, or--ironically--magic cards.

You had no way of knowing silver would be worth so much paper money in the future.

The reason they're worth so much is because the game is still being played. Since the first two editions have drastically different borders, inking, and wording, most people that play the game can tell instantly how old your cards are. Having the older cards is a status symbol.  

Some of the older cards are so powerful in the game you can't use them in most tournaments, but some you can use in all tournaments because they have been reprinted(so you can use any edition of the card). Also, you can play with your friends and show off. People like showing off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can find stories in your area [here](http://locator.wizards.com/).
Go on a Friday night to one and hang around a bit. Everyone always plays magic on Friday Night, they even have a name for it: FNM (Friday Night Magic).
You will find people to play, but depending on your area that might be a bit competitive for you. However, there should be people hanging around just having fun, especially in a big city like Philly.

You can check out [here](http://magiccards.info/search.html) for cards. There are quite a few more than are on the PC.  Different stores and people often have different rules about which you can use, called "formats."  However, you are allowed to use any cards from any edition and any language, assuming one version of the card is legal in the format. 

Example: In the "Standard" format, [Giant Growth](http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/125.html) is legal because it was printed in *Return to Ravnica.* If you have a [Japanese Super Series one](http://magiccards.info/sus/jp/8.html), it's still playable in all Standard games. The only exception would be if you found one that did not have a normal magic back *(or had a silver or gold border, but don't worry about that)*. 

I would check out what people are playing in your area before making any decisions. You might even be able to borrow some decks for a bit to get a feel for the 'real' version of the game. That's what I would do; see if you can borrow some decks and see what people you want to play with are playing with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess that's a fair enough point.  My understanding was that whole "dino bone" thing was believe to have been done as, or before, the world was created. So I had interpreted that comic on the right to be symbolic of something happening 'before' time started.

Therefor, the comic on the left would also be happening as the deistic God was setting everything up--setting the stage as it were--not happening after the play had started.

But, your response is measured and I can find nothing wrong with your interpretation. 

Anyway, the real point I was trying to get at was that dino bones coming from dinosaurs is more believable then any holy texts. So, if people were going to believe something was placed on Earth as a divine "which one of these things doesn't fit" test, I wish they believed it was the holy texts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He is not me. I'm the creator of this collage. 

Anyway, yes, this comic is basically saying I wish religious people were all Diests. I know many Atheists feel that the shift from fundamentalism to Deism would not be enough. But, I have not known any Diests to perform deplorable acts in the name of their Watchmaker. Maybe I just never looked hard enough. Anyway, in the interest of full disclosure, I guess I better confess to being a Materialistic Diest myself, not an Atheist. So, there you go.  </TEXT>

So, either she and her buddy were cheating or they sold their soul for that sealed pool. One of the two.

I play a lot of magic and I saw the two of them around at big tournaments in the area for years. It always bothered me when I did. I mean, who cheats at a Cold Snap prerelease? (Not that I can say for certain they did, but 4 Gelid Shackles? and Zur?) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyway, to respond in an actually helpful way.  First, were I you I would get to know the [magiccards.info](http://magiccards.info/search.html) search engine a bit.  It's good for finding things like "human barbarian" and also can give you an idea of price as well as where you could pick up the cards once you find them. 

Second, if you're asking if a deck such as that is "viable" it makes it sound like you want to, you know, **win** in your casual group.  Therefore, more information about your group would be helpful before useful recommendations could be made. Are your casual games more one-on-one or multiplayer, for example?  Is this for EDH or just for 60 card casual?  And, what kind of players do you have in your group? Are you trying to build a casual deck that can win against standard legal decks in-between FNM rounds? Or are you just playing against your brother's scarecrow deck or something?  

Little things like multiplayer vs one-on-one makes a HUGE difference in deck building strategy, especially for a red-deck-wins (RDW) deck like you are thinking of building. Cards like [Lovisa Coldeyes](http://magiccards.info/cs/en/90.html) are much more playable in a multiplayer game then in one-on-one because of the higher casting cost. RDWs are better one-on-one then in multiplayer games in general because they can deal a lot of damage very quickly, but then run out of gas. This is good in one-on-one when there is only one guy. If you focus all of your attention on one guy you can kill him, but then you are dead in the water for the rest of the game if there are more people in that game *(assuming you don't have access to cards like [Wheel of Fortune](http://magiccards.info/rv/en/184.html) or [the like](http://magiccards.info/avr/en/151.html))*. 

Assuming one-on-one, budget, and only humans I would be looking at something like:

4 [Keldon Marauders](http://magiccards.info/pc/en/102.html)

4 [Stormblood Berserker](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/156.html)

4 [Stonewright](http://magiccards.info/avr/en/157.html)

4 [Lightning Mauler](http://magiccards.info/avr/en/144.html)

3 [Gathan Raiders](http://magiccards.info/arc/en/40.html)

3 [Balduvian Horde](http://magiccards.info/dm/en/10.html)

2 [Fireblast](http://magiccards.info/vi/en/79.html)

4 [Browbeat](http://magiccards.info/tsts/en/56.html)

4 [Lightning Bolt](http://magiccards.info/m11/en/149.html)

4 [Lava Spike](http://magiccards.info/chk/en/178.html)

4 [Flame Rift](http://magiccards.info/ne/en/80.html)

4 [Teetering Peaks](http://magiccards.info/pd2/en/30.html)

16 Mountains

But, that's just off the top of my head, so take it with a grain of salt. You probably don't even need 20 lands in a deck like that. Also, you might want to pick up [Fire and Lightning](https://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/pdsfirelightning/productinfo) *(if you can find it cheap)* as a starting point. </TEXT>
