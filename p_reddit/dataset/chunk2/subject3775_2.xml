	<TEXT> Definitely knew the snake guy. Bought a 10 foot boa or python. He was girlfriend's roomate's boyfriend. Muscle builder but wouldn't play Frisbee because he said it would tone his muscles and make them smaller. It was all about the look. Funny thing with the snake. He liked to play "who's fastest" with his snake. He'd get some raw chicken, warm it up to body temp then flap it around in front of the snake. The snake would coil up and go into a ready posture. He'd wave the meat around then pull it back when he saw the snake starting to strike. When the snake hit the meat instead of missing, he'd let it eat. Sort of had to because the snake had teeth pointing backward in its mouth, so you couldn't really drag anything back. Anyway, one time he pulled the meat back over his shoulder. The snake missed the meat, but hit his head. The teeth stuck into his scalp and he started bleeding like a stuck pig. He and the girlfriend were trying to work its jaws off, but he was very concerned that they not hurt his precious snake. The snake started unhinging its jaw and stretching its mouth. It was trying to eat his fucking owner! Each time the snake worked its jaw, its mouth slide a little further open and further down his head. He was bleeding pretty bad. When the jaw got over his eyebrow, they decided to go to the emergency room. He was still intent that his snake not be hurt but when he walked in the ER with a 10 foot snake hanging off his head and blood running down his face and shirt, they immediately took out a scalpel and cut the snake's head off. The guy was super pissed and was trying to sue them for the price of a new snake.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there any astronomical or astrophysics basis to this statement in the article:

The culprit appears to be the supermassive black holes found in the centres of galaxies. Some of the matter falling towards the holes is converted into energy. 

A literal reading of this sentence suggests there is direct matter to energy conversion at the event horizon/firewall of a black hole. Matter to energy conversion does happen in the fusion cores of stars and in radioactive nuclei decay, but I've never hear it described as occurring on the surface of an event horizon. Can anyone elaborate?

	<TEXT> It's a decent SF book. It won the Nebula Award in 1976. Written 40 years ago, so you have to expect some retro and anachronistic elements. The gay thing is a minor plot element. It is mainly an allegory for the Viet Nam War, which was very recent experience and very much on all of our minds. After quite a long interval, he eventually wrote a sequel called "The Forever Peace" which I don't recall enjoying quite as much. Certainly I couldn't summarize the plot basics from memory as I can for the original.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a beekeeper I'll tell you, 1000 bees is a hive that is badly dwindled and in danger of dying out. Typical commercial 3 lb "packages" of bees consist of about 10,000 bees and a queen. A "Nucleus" hive is typically 5 frames covered with bees and would typically have closer to 5000 bees, but would also include brood that would have new bees starting to hatch out immediately, to start swelling the population. Nuc hives are created by taking two frames of bees, with brood. This is still about 2000 bees, plus brood ready to start hatching. 

Since this paper is an "in silico" theoretical model, it has its own logic, but thought it was interesting that actual practice starts new hives with 2000 or twice the theoretical minimum critical population.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Joe Halderman's book, "The Forever War", the main character is a grunt soldier in an interstellar war where he effectively hops forward in time as he spends years in time dilation on the way to and from battles at near light speed. Written in 1974 by a Vietnam combat vet, the main character becomes the "old man" who survives through multiple battles and the ranks fill with newbies born centuries after he first enlisted in the war effort. In the projected future the government began encouraging homosexuality as a means to stop the population boom. After time, homosexuality becomes the norm, and heterosexuality the weird perversion. The other soldiers call him "queer" behind his back.   </TEXT>

While it is unclear whether this diagram came from your own work or was synthesized by the journalist, a strange feature of the diagram is that it shows 4 different lineages of modern humans alive today, including two separate lineages in Africa, and two more outside of Africa. Can you comment on the identification of these 4 lineages? Are the two outside of africa the Europeans/Asians with Neanderthal gene, and the Papau New Guinea/Australians with Denisovian genes? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I don't have the background to evaluate the complete implications of this research to the narrow field it is filed in, on the surface it appears to be a quite obvious conclusion wrapped in pretentious and overly jargoned terminology. I'll also take issue with the title of the post as compared to the content of the original research. From the original paper summary  

A trade-off between survival and reproduction is evident throughout the geographical ranges of our study species: resprouting species with fire-protected buds had much higher fire survival than nonsprouters without fire-protected buds (97% vs. 2%) but they also had substantially lower fecundity and recruitment rates. We found little intraspecific variation in fire survival rates but considerable intraspecific variation in fecundity and recruitment  

Basically it says there wasn't much variation in fire survival between different species, but there was a big variation between species in their subsequent bloom fertilization (ie "recruitment") and seed production ("fecundity").   

On a broader scale, the research finds the species distribution of shrubs in an area damaged by fire changes in the years after the fire, with some species assuming a greater percentage of the total population/biomass whereas other species declining in population percentage.   

Clearly a fire will affect the local microclimates, especially since microclimates are themselves partially the result of the forest population. There are species that only flourish in direct sunlight whereas others are intolerant of direct sun. Dense foliage tends to create pockets of shade where moisture and humus accumulates, providing a nursery environment where some species would otherwise be unable to survive. These have been tenants of forest evolution over time.   

This is not my field, but I'm having a hard time understanding why this would be considered a significant paper worth publishing. While this paper provides a quantitative confirmation of long known principles, through the use of dense technical jargon it appears the authors are trying to make the case that it is making a profound statement about expected affects of climate change. Is there someone who can disabuse me of this impression? Is there something here of more significance? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the Philippines there is a dark skinned pygmie type tribe in the mountains called the Negritoes. The USAF used to work with them doing survival training for pilots before they started their tours in Vietnam. Basically they'd drop the pilots in the jungle and they had to do escape and evasion as long as they could until the tribesmen caught them. My dad had pictures of the guys that captured and fed him until the trainers showed up to get him. They looked different from Filipinos - very short, afroid type features, kinky afro style hair. Interestingly, they also smoked cigarettes with the lit end in their mouths. Pictures I've seen of the Papau New Guinea highlanders looked very similar, although not so small.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This is my graphical interpretation](http://imgur.com/Et9cMEz) of the interbreeding timeline described in the prose in the article. Some questions as to whether all these are accurate but at least a little more detail than their graphic  

What I think they're saying is that there are 4 branches of modern humans (in the drawing at least). 
Not sure what the two in Africa are.
I think the two non-african variants are  
V.c: European/Asians/Amerindians with 1-3% Neanderthal and traces of Densinovian.   
V.d Australian/Papau New Guinea natives with 3-7% Denisovian DNA.   

It is unclear whether they're saying the archaic modern human/neanderthal cross completely died out, or is included in the Neanderthal genome V.c (europeans, asians, etc) carry in their DNA  

It also seems like they're saying the Australians/PNG natives don't include the Neanderthal genes, just the Denisovians, questioning whether that is a separate branch.

	<TEXT> This is a very interesting and thought provoking article. I am troubled by some of the terminology and the graphics not fully reflecting the complexity described in the prose. Apparently the cave in Denisova was home not only to the hominid line "Denisovians" but also Altai-Neaderthal who were themselves genetically distinct from your European based Neaderthals. The genetics of the Altai-Neanderthal also apparently incorporated some DNA of a Homo Erectus  from a cross breeding as recent as 400K years ago. [The graphic](http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline_colwidth__16_9/public/images/lb_R_NeandertalEMBED.jpg?itok=V8aR4diR) shows multiple branchings of the modern humans, including two present today in Africa and two more outside of Africa, but only a single breed line for all the described lines Neaderthals, never mind the described Homo Erectus.  It would be really nice to see the full complexity described in the article accurately portrayed in a graphic.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Current marine dead zones are largely attributed to high nutrient loads causing runaway proliferation of organisms the subsequently deplete the oxygen in the water column. Examples are areas such as the Chesapeake Bay deadzones in the run from farming areas where chicken manure is applied to farm fields. Also at the outflow of the Mississippi river into the Gulf of Mexico, carrying nutrient loads from the entire US Midwest. Similar dead zones also occur in the Baltic, Mediterranean and South China Sea.  While these are related to human activity, they seem more the result of human disruption of natural Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycles rather than the Carbon cycle changes normally associated with anthropogenic Global Warming/Climate change. How relevant are oceanic oxygen level changes from past, natural climate change episodes to the current oxygen depletion scenarios? Are you postulating increased oceanic nutrient loads in past, natural climate change or are you looking at completely different mechanisms? How does the magnitude of past oxygen depletion compare to current day dead zones?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Spitzer telescope recently determined the rate of expansion of the universe is 74.2 km/sec +/- 2.1 km/sec per megaparsec. (per 3.26 million light years). Dividing the speed of light c by the expansion rate gives 13.1 Billion light years as the distance beyond which the universe is expanding faster than speed of light. Of course this is just linear calculation. There's some nonlinearity with an asymptotic approach to the speed of light that probably makes the distance a little bit further. But consider, the age of the universe is ~13.7 billion years; but the universe was opaque to light for the first 380,000 years. So, the light speed receding edge of the visible universe is approximately same distance away in light years as the point in time when the first photons in the universe started propagating. The farthest away spotted galaxy,EGS-zs8-1, is 13.1 billion light years away --ie it is right on the edge of that light speed receding edge.  </TEXT>

Also, same question in reference to Susskind, et al with regards to suitably entangled particles seeming to be connected by wormhole like structures. Is this a purely theoretical example? Or, alternatively, is there an actual observed phenomenon where a connection through extradimensional wormholes connections is one explanation? If the latter, can you provide more detail on that observation?

	<TEXT> Oman, UAE, Kuwait all have between 300 and 600 tanks in their army inventory. If you assume all those countries armies have 100% of their tanks in exercise readiness AND are willing to send them into the exercise, leaving the home country undefended, you still only get to total of 2,500 medium and heavy tanks. Maybe twice that if you include APCs and the like. You can say yeah, but Egypt, Sudan   Turkey too. Those countries can't drive their tanks to Saudi - they'd have to ship them. You'd see stuff like the months run up to Gulf War I   II: cargo ship after cargo ship with tanks rolling off. That hasn't been happening, and oh by the way, none of these fucking countries have 100% of their tank inventories operational. A lot of them probably have readiness rates below 50%. 

I'd have to say that was probably the "Mother of All Press Releases".

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Descriptions of string theory indicate various versions of theory require 6, 7, 10 or 11 dimensions whereas we only perceive 3, or 4 dimensions if you count time as one. The fact that we can't see or sense these dimensions is explained by suggestions that they are "compact" or curled up in tiny closed loops. Do any of the string theories describe forces or particles that transmit or translate through these hidden dimensions to create effects we can see and measure in the 3/4 visible dimensions? For example, particle quantum entanglement is bit of mystery in our current physics, especially the apparent "instaneous" communication of the quantum state information between entangled particles when one particle is measured. Do any of the string theories suggest the channel of communication between distantly separated entangled particles could be communicated through these hidden dimensions? Are there any other examples of forces or fields in the standard model that string theory says is operating through these dimensions?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People discussing fusion reactors usually focus on the use of abundant Deuterium extracted from water as the fuel. While Deuterium would be part of the fuel mix, most of the fusion reactor designs are built around the use of a combined deuterium-tritium fuel source. The ITER reactor for example [will use a 1:1 mix of D-T fuel](https://www.iter.org/sci/fusionfuels). The D-T fusion reaction produces an excess neutron. These neutrons have applications  such as producing more tritium for the reactor's fuel, but they will also induce radioactivity in the materials that make up the structure and lining of the reaction chamber. The end result will be the production of nuclear waste - radioactive metals and the like. It will be no where near the volume of radioactive waste produced by fission reactors; but it will be produced none the less. Some designs have also called for the fusion reactor to be used to breed plutonium from the neutrons and U238 lining the reaction chamber. The plutonium would be used to fuel fission based reactors but has the added issue of being a nuclear weapons material - something that could be considered a hazard of the fusion reactor.  </TEXT>

I don't mean to demean this accomplishment, but the "temperature" of the solar wind near earth is something like 150K kelvin, but is so diffuse there is effectively no heat transfer. I notice both the China and German announcements haven't mentioned the plasma density. Wondering if they're both still a very long way from confining a plasma that interacts with itself sufficiently to initiate fusion.  </TEXT>

Remember Heinlein was himself a WWII Navy Vet. This was written during golly gee wilkers golden years of the Eisenhower era.

	<TEXT> No, I am instead saying that a deputy's unsubstantiated testimony should be insufficient for criminal charges. The recent proliferation of readily available video cameras on cell phones has demonstrated police officers are quite willing to lie through their teeth about charges against individuals simply because it is an instrument of their power. It is clear this woman is no angel. Charging her with a crime that has a sentence of 6 years when the deputy says he wasn't actually hurt, says her actual crime was merely being disruptive and probably disrespectful. However, she probably couldn't be arrested for being disruptive. Claiming assault was just a "little white lie" to demonstrate his power.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> even though the deputy testified at trial that the kick didn't hurt and left no marks on his shin   

So the deputy says it didn't hurt and he had no physical proof that she actually kicked him at all. This raises the question, so why did he bother to claim he was assaulted if he didn't suffer any injury. The answer is the same as the one for the question "Why does a dog lick his balls"?

	<TEXT> The issue is not property theft. It is instead the practice demolishing the homes of family members of those who commit murder or attempted murder. The argument /u/Jkeets777 is making is that it is justified to knock down the house of the perpetrator's family because the PA supports the family financially. This is really a red herring. It's not really clear the assertion that the PA does this is anything more than hearsay, but assuming it is valid. One can very well draw parallels with the economic and legal support the Israeli government has provided to settlers. Really the focus should be on the validity of home destruction for associates of the perpetrators. If you're going to stand by this practice for deterring Palestinian terrorists, why do you think it wouldn't also similarly deter Jewish terrorists?    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While PA's wink, wink, nod, nod attitude toward Palestinians perpetuating violence is disgusting,  the issue here is consistent application of legal remedies the Israeli authorities use against Palestinian vs Jewish terrorists. It can very well be argued that the Israeli government support for Jewish settlers who seize arab owned lands to build settlements is the equivalent of the PA support for the families of terrorists. If tearing down the home of an extended family of palestinians because one member of the family engaged in an attack on Israelis is justified, why should it not apply to Jewish settlers who do the same? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of discussion of the Fermi Paradox and Drake Equation look at probability both across space and time. For space they look at the sheer number of stars, assume some proportion have planets, then some smaller proportion have Earth like planets, then some smaller proportion have life arise, then complex multi-cellular life, then intelligent life, then technologically capable life. The argument of time is one that says this whole sequence could have occurred anytime since the universe first began until the present time; and that technological civilizations exist for a finite time, either because they destroy themselves or transform into something we no longer recognize as intelligent/technological life. This article modifies the above thought process slightly by saying, wait a minute - there weren't enough heavy elements available in the first and possibly second generation of stars for Earth like planets capable of sustaining life to form. The clock for these equations has to be started much later. The problem with this descriptive article is that it doesn't document any of the updated assumptions that they're using to make their assessment. The sun is a third generation star so at least part of the assessment is apparently that only 3rd generation stars are likely to host the proper planets (and when did the first 3rd generation stars come into existence). This article would have a lot more credibility if all the assumptions about what is required for life on an earth-like planet to exist were documented or at least mentioned.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While your transparency report is a good first step, there is a category of moderator actions that isn't addressed in your report at all, one which has a strong odor of moderator personal bias.   

The sub rules indicate submissions must be from peer reviewed journals, yet a large portion, ney a majority of top posts are from popular science news sites writing about new peer reviewed research. Given this characteristic of the sub as a whole, removed posts for "not a peer reviewed journal" appear to be motivated by something other than sub rules. The number of removed original posts, as opposed to removed comments, along with the reason for removal, does not appear to be a category in your transparency report. 

Similarly, original posts with fairly extensive comment threads have been removed with reason cited "Post is duplicate of same news from another source" and "Posting is lower rated (even though it may have been posted earlier) than duplicate". Again, this is a sub rule that appears to be honored more in the breach than in actual practice. At any point in time, it is not uncommon to find the same new scientific announcement/news listed in the sub from at least 3 or 4 different sources.  Sometimes this is tedious, but other times helpful. Some sources have better analysis or illustrative graphics for the discovery. Yet, somehow, sometimes a moderator will decide one of these shouldn't be in the sub and will remove it. Your transparency report should document when these so called "duplicates" are removed, along with statistics on cases where duplicates are allowed to remain.

What kind of crap is this? A person who is basically a criminal assault perp get to testify that his actions are consistent with state police policy and training? How does he get to be the witness who asserts this. Although I've no doubt the State Police would have no problem finding some other lying asshole who was willing to assert the same, shouldn't such a statement be coming from someone within the police management hierarchy responsible for policy? Shouldn't someone from police training be testifying that yes indeed they train police officers to kick motorists who are complying with a traffic stop in the chest with their boots? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bit pedantic, but the phrasing of the question "fastest accelerating things" is ambiguous. It can be interpreted as either things that were accelerated to high speed or things that are accelerated at the highest (fastest) rate. The point being objects can achieve very high speeds as the result of long duration low acceleration. Conversely an object subjected to very high acceleration, or deceleration, doesn't have to achieve a very high end velocity if it is subjected to a very short duration but high intensity acceleration. By the latter definition things like high velocity projectiles impacting into solid surfaces can be described as having very high decelerations  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Russia recently announced a new concern about the growing problem of space junk cluttering Earth's orbital space: they declared a [space junk collision with a military satellite could spark a war](http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-says-space-junk-could-spark-war-2016-1). While the causes of sudden satellite failures are mysteries that have to be solved, space junk collisions are clearly a possibility that has to be considered. Why would Russia go out of their way to say such an event could provoke a war? Are they declaring their own country's inability to accept such destruction of one their own satellites as blameless?  (Many Russians are still convinced the USA sank their submarine Kursk). Are they preparing the waters for Russia to attack American satellites and be able to deny responsibility? What agenda or possible agendas does such a declaration have?

	<TITLE> [Serious]What is the significance of the Bangkok Bomber wearing a yellow T-shirt? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> In news reports over the past several years, I recall different Thai political factions identified themselves by wearing colored T-shirts. Yellow was the color of the political party that I thought forced the ouster of previous premier. Is the color of the bomber's T-shirt considered significant? Is it the color of the political party currently in power or an out-of-power faction?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doob is clearly Neil Degrasse Tyson. President JBF "Julia", is she supposed to be Hilliary Roddam Clinton? Haven't yet seen her referred to as HRC but is often called "Hilliary" derisively by opponents.  Are any other characters loosely or not so loosely modeled on current day public figures? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> LA highway accidents causing gridlock that destroys the city </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-31 22:10:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not a "book" but a short story describing a disaster that strikes LA: multiple simultaneous accidents completely gridlock all the highways.  Some of the accidents turn into infernos that knock down over passes and create huge blockage of burnt cars. Surface roads grid lock from all the people trying to bypass the highways and the whole city "locks". Food trucks cannot make it into the city, starvation and riots, general breakdown of disorder erupts. Millions die, it is years before the roads can be cleared and a lot of the city is destroyed by fires and warfare.   </TEXT>

Are there any other countries besides the USA where  symbols and leaders of a failed rebel movement are celebrated in monuments; and those monuments are tolerated by regime which won the war? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Could I see anything without light amplification on the surface of Pluto? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If I was standing on the day side of Pluto in an appropriately heated and insulated spacesuit looking out at the landscape, how bright would it be? The pictures from New Horizons don't look that much different than other planets closer to the sun, but one suspects they are processed to be vastly brighter than reality. You can see a fair amount by the light of the moon? Is there any gauge for the Sun on Pluto being as bright as some fraction of a full moon?
