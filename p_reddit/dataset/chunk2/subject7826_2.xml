	<TEXT> Once you get into the middle of hospice care, you realize that end-of-life is much more in the hands of the dying person (and their family, if the person is unconscious or impaired) than you might have thought. I've been through it 3 times already. Two times, the patient was ready to die in their own mind, and they essentially turned the switch off and died, surrounded by family. The third time, the patient was scared of dying, and was in hospice for over a year (even though docs had predicted 2-6 weeks...) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is certainly possible to have an equally casual and relaxed approach to geometry constructions, especially given modern dynamic geometry software.

Only after students have come to enjoy screwing around with constructions and animations do we need to break the news that they can actually be *useful*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wan't making claims about percentages of academics using the language, I was just recommending it on its own merits. Haskell is surprisingly good (read: both decipherable and efficient) for computing *some* things. Have you ever actually given it a go? If not, you should try it, especially if you are designing algorithms. However, if all you are doing is making library calls, then it makes less sense...

FORTRAN, there's a choice that I hadn't thrown out there. THERE is a language with library support and stability, along with a certain vintage quality (despite which it is almost certainly a better choice than C++). 

C is always there, I suppose, and I've got to admit, it is usually my own language of choice for things that demand efficiency. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um, OP is intending on staying academic, if I'm not mistaken.

In which case Haskell is the obvious choice, especially given a background in Mathematica.

C++, Python, and Java are fine for what they are. But not for expressing mathematics. </TEXT>
