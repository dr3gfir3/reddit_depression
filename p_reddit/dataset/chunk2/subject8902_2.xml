	<TEXT> I purchased a new car last month. I was told the Atlanta Hawks license plate was available, but when I tried to purchase it, the tag would not process properly.

Has anyone had any luck? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do understand it's not as well known as Mt Rushmore, or similar attractions, but it still generates a large amount of revenue for Georgia.

It's an old article, but in 2012 they had 4 million visitors. http://www.ajc.com/news/business/stone-mountain-park-owner-were-50-bigger-than-10-1/nRBcG/

I am definitely not defending the content of the park. I feel they need to add the MLK Liberty Bell and other attractions to illustrate how far we have come since the days of the Confederacy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one is saying that immigrants shouldn't be properly vetted. I definitely agree that we should be careful with who we allow to move here. Trump is suggesting we not allow any Muslims here, properly vetted or not. Which I think could actually hurt us. I do believe many Muslim students from other countries attend our Universities. 

And there's the issue of the Muslim database of American citizens he's calling for.

Yeah, the additional pay would be nice, but it's just not worth it to me at the moment. Maybe when I have a child and the additional income is more necessary. </TEXT>

We understand the action of a few Christians doesn't mean you can paint all Christians with the same brush.

	<TEXT> The refugees are trying to evade the same people we are and are just trying to live their lives with the same hopes and fears as us Americans. And there is a process they have to go through in order to be accepted. We don't just open the gates.

It general takes between 12 and 18 months for them to be accepted and they are seriously vetted during said period. 

The Islamophobia is exactly what isis wants. Going to help swell their numbers.  </TEXT>

Still a great almost come back though. They came our in the second half with energy and didn't let the deficit bring them down. Hope they will continue to play like that.  </TEXT>
