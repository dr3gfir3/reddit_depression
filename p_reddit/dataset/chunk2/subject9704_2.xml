	<TEXT> I agree that teachers will know what is best for each individual situation. 

I am totally ignorant to a teacher's relationship with their union so I am sure I could be totally wrong. But, I would be surprised if this individual knowledge makes it to the union level, given the unions income is directly related to teachers income and unions represent a large number of teachers the union has more incentive to focus on things like income. 

Any teachers on here with some insight?

Also how much of this is the extremely politically powerful teacher unions pushing their agenda? These unions are concerned with the teachers, not the children, so they are not always arguing for the best for our kid's education.

Either way we are sure to have an educational roller coaster coming.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having a corporate tax rate of 35% compared to the world average of 24% does not make sense. If we want to encourage companies to remain American companies this really needs to be lower.

Also for the repatriation of money, buybacks seem like a waste to me but even if the companies put the majority of the money into dividends that would dump a whole lot of dollars back into circulation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I was saying; The DNC and Podesta email leaks contain a large amount of evidence that major news media outlets were colluding with the DNC and the HRC campaign. 

Your right about the end user, but it kind of works towards the point of distrusting the media. We live in a time where we have unprecedented access to first party sources and we should make sure as individuals we are using those sources. I always try to find the original content if accessible for context and clarity. 

So I agree with you, personal responsibility is a good solution for each individual person. I also think that distrust in the media is not some fringe idea, it is most likely a major factor in the rise of online commentators like Secular Talk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe not NYT but they aren't the only game in town. The media collusion exposed by the DNC and Podesta leaks alone should give enough reason to distrust the media. 

Then there was the president of CNN telling President Trump to watch out because they control the American narrative over seas. 

I mean there are what 6 companies that own almost every single major news outlet, that is pretty questionable to me. 

The distrust in the media is way bigger than anything Trump. 

So there are good guys out there like the Intercept but there are also highly controlled corporate media entities that maybe deserve more scrutiny.  </TEXT>

I will say though that the American family has taken some hits over the past couple decades, so maybe there isn't someone who is against families sticking together but our culture is moving in that direction.

Do you think it would be smart for our President to talk shit about another countries leader? This seems like it slams the door rather than keeping it open for diplomacy. I think it is wise not to take the bait and start putting Putin down, this may be our best chance to gain favor and maybe effect change in Russian society.

Lastly, the most recent 'defense' of Putin in saying that we have not been so good is the type of honesty I like to see. Trump campaigned on our failed interventionist policy and for him to man up and say that America has made mistakes is pretty big.  </TEXT>

Time and time again Trump has demonstrated that calling him names and demanding action go nowhere with him. However even people who had done that in the past but went and met with Trump come out of the meeting with positive words and with their message being heard. 

If Bernie is genuinely concerned he should try a new approach because the grandstanding is not good for anything but TV. </TEXT>

I think May's message can be used as a great response to people criticizing Trump for not putting Putin on full blast. Keeping the door open is usually better than slamming it shut when it comes to cooperation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I find amazing is The NY Times runs a story based off of an anonymous source with apparently intimate details about the west wing. Even about Trump watching tv in his bathrobe. These types of claims should be backed by a name I think because of their intimate nature. 

Another interesting media phenomenon is the 30 other stories on sites like Slate or the Washington Post that are based off of one sentence from The NY Times story and reported as absolute fact.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it depends on how we are defining a lie. Did Trump lie about releasing his tax returns? I haven't seen that his audit is over, and this could be me not paying enough attention, is it over? Because i believe he said he would after the audit. 

So I don't think lying is great, I cannot defend it. But I would have to review the majority of the lies to see. Is it a lie if someone misunderstands or mis-speaks? Is it a lie if they change their mind? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're examples are such a wide array of detailed topics it would be quite a long conversation to address and cite evidence for everyone. But I think that with examples like Mexico is our enemy and Putin is our friend you are combining multiple items into one category with the theme being either, "Mexico is our enemy and Putin is our friend". But none of the individual pieces of evidence draw those conclusions, the conclusions are yours. 

I don't think the administration is pushing an alternative facts narrative. Conway said that and I do not think she is the best spokesperson for the admins. 

I am glad trump has called out CNN, they have been unfair and consistently lie through omission. The head of CNN even said that they control the narrative overseas and Trump should be nice to them because of it, a tacit threat. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/19/cnns-president-has-fired-a-warning-shot-at-donald-trump/?utm_term=.6ead00edb67b)

So not liking Trump and building a straw man Trump are two different things. I appreciate people with substantiated criticism of Trump but when people throw vague platitudes and Straw Men Trump around they are not moving any conversation forward....they are preventing it.

*I want to warn you there will be links in this, which i know you don't like.*

He did not threaten to invade an ally, the reporting seems to be that that never happened. 
(http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-trump-20170201-story.html)

And, our Ambassador to the UN just condemned Russia. The recent sanctions info is in this link too.

You are working on a compelling conspiracy theory and that's fine. Conspiracy theories can be fun but I would not recommend getting too caught up in it.

It isn't a game. Calling for a Military Coup on a sitting President is not a game. If there isn't proof that the Russians and Trump are working together you can guess they are, or build whatever conspiracy theory you would like, but do not present it as fact.

I recently identified, in a conversation with my brother, that I have an incredibly low standard for what politicians I will support right now; Integrity.

This is corny but I am glad there is at least a community like this one on the web where I can guarantee we all don't agree on everything except for one thing consistently, Making America Great Again. 

I'd be happy to argue with you any time lol.

	<TEXT> Tell me the definition then because there appears to be many. these kids may not be fascists but they are acting like authoritarians and have some shared qualities with Fascism. They certainly are not liberal because they obviously do not care about individual rights.

The definition on dictionary.com
http://www.dictionary.com/browse/fascism

 (initial capital letter) a political movement that employs the principles and methods of fascism...

the 14 characteristics on this website (http://www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htm) have some direct links to how the protesters act(they are not a state so not every category pertains to them);


1) Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.

*This is not to say they are American Nationalists, but the anti-fa kids definitely have a strong group identity and they certainly carry flags...they even use them to beat dissenters!*


2)Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.


3) Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.


11) Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. **Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.** </TEXT>
