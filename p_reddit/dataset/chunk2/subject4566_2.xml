	<TEXT> A big part of this are the debates, but that doesn't explain why this didn't happen in 2004, 2008 or 2012. Fox News underplayed the "Trump tape" and the aftermath, so interested viewers had to look elsewhere. Roger Ailes is gone, so maybe Fox lacks his instinct for what viewers want. And then there's Trump. Trump just isn't as broadly popular with Republicans as Bush, McCain or Romney. And some Trump supporters (including Donald Trump) are really upset at Megyn Kelly. It's been a long time since I followed daily cable ratings closely, so I can't tell if her numbers have suffered much. She still beats the competition. Right-wing sites seem to think she's suffering for her liberal sins, though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Multnomah County's ballots are confusingly aligned </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-21 04:17:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Quick, is [this oval](http://imgur.com/LxSwpbD) for Democrat Mark Callahan or Republican Eric Navickas?

It is, in fact, for Mark Callahan, but he's a Republican, not a Democrat. Most of us will figure this out with the [context](http://imgur.com/kfLYqWFl) of the rest of the ovals and names, which I cropped out of the first image. But that requires an extra bit of pattern recognition and reasoning that could slip up, say, an elderly voter. It's hardly the most challenging puzzle, but history shows a confusing ballot alignment can cause real trouble.

In Florida's 2000 election mess, Palm Beach County's infamous ["butterfly ballot"](http://imgur.com/6RXnujE) had party tickets alternating on the left and right of a column of holes, with arrows pointing to the right holes for each party. But this liberal Florida county, with a significant Jewish community, ended up giving Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan [three times the votes](http://www.salon.com/2000/11/09/florida_vote/) of any other county, an unlikely result for an ultra-conservative minor-party candidate repeatedly accused of anti-Semitism.

It only takes a few accidental votes to tip a close race. And while you can't prevent all voter mistakes, Multnomah County can improve the ballot design next time. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pixel looks like a hit on Google Trends </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-12 21:18:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Searches aren't sales, but according to [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all q=pixel,iphone,ipad,apple%20watch,apple%20tv), Pixel searches are currently just shy of where iPhone searches were at launch, as well as where iPad searches were at launch and where iPad searches are at present, while the Pixel is way ahead of the Apple Watch and Apple TV. On this scale, Pixel searches were previously a flat line, so this jump is phone-related. Also, these lines are relative to total Google search traffic, and there was a lot less search traffic in 2007, which suggests that on an absolute measure, there are more Pixel searches now than there were then. Contrarily, Apple users search a lot with Siri now, reducing their representation in the more recent data.

Pixel searches tower over [this collection](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all q=pixel,galaxy%20s7,htc%20one,moto%20g,galaxy%20s4) of past and present popular Android phones, with the exception of the standout Galaxy S4, which is the best-selling Android of all time. The Pixel is almost equal to the peak of the S4. One advantage the Pixel has in the searches, though, is no version number to specify or not specify.

If you compare [single-word phone-related searches](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all q=pixel,galaxy,lg,htc,motorola), and subtract prior non-phone search levels for other meanings of "pixel" and "galaxy," it looks like Pixel phones are getting just about 40% of the searches for all Galaxy products combined, 60% of LG searches, and significantly more searches than HTC or Motorola. (LG makes a lot more than phones, of course).

Maybe the most important comparison for Google is [Nexus](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all q=pixel,nexus). Pixel is already ahead of the Nexus launch hype, and it's not even out yet. It's got a ways to go before it reaches the peak of the Nexus 7, but it's way above where Nexus is now.

Searches and sales aren't the same thing, and this could just be a spike that soon subsides, but this all seems promising. </TEXT>
