	<TEXT> It's the best PG-13 horror film to come out in some time. Solid 7.5/10. Entertaining all the way through with believable characters and motivations, and the last act is one big 20 minute scare fest. However some of the decisions made we're standard horror cliche mistakes, it's easy to look past them. Would highly recommend, theatre experience was god awful though.  </TEXT>
