	<TEXT> I have same problem too. I always have been so fucking embarrassed and frustrated when it happens. The most embarrassed I ever have been was with my friend in the middle of Hollywood at Big Wangs restaurant. I couldn't swallow after eating a couple of wings and had to force myself to vomit in the restroom. It really sucked trying to explain it to my friend and it made me feel like such a loser. I had my throat stretched after that, but it didn't solve the problem because my allergies do factor into it. I recently have been taking 2 tablets of generic mucinex before I eat meals and it has been helping a lot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it does turn out to be true that he really had no prior knowledge of what his chief of staff did, it still is very relevant to his potential presidential campaign because it shows a lack of good judgment of character and lack of supervision over people working in his office. People will want to what kind of goons would he hire in the White House. Would his friends cross the line like G. Gordon Liddy, Patrick Buchanan and John Dean did for Nixon?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely agree with you about textures not being as good a PS1. In my opinion, the N64 does not come close to meeting the criteria to be considered a failure. But Capcom did an amazing job of porting Resident Evil 2 to N64. The prerendered backgrounds and characters looked fantastic but fmv was grainy because it had to be condensed. I don't know for sure, but it probably was not a lot of fun for them to port it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you don't get it. My point is that you are being ignorant about the American education system based on one poster on Reddit. You do not know for a fact that American children are taught that Hitler killed 6 million+ Jews and the others are nothing but an afterthought. Jews do not control secondary school textbooks or schools themselves. How do I know if your history in Germany is being whitewashed or loose with the facts, or not?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok I stand corrected. There does appear to be a real systemic failure within the BBB that I was not aware of. They need to clean house and start all over again. This is a real shame because they did help me when T-Mobile refused to honor their rebates. T-Mobile called me up and told me because of my complaint to BBB, I would get my  rebates after all. They aren't even BBB accredited.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole point though is that people are making these accusations on here without concrete proof. There may be a few people from the BBB who take bribes but people on here are making it sound like it is their policy. Every agency has bad apples that should not have their jobs. This doesn't detract from all of the good that the BBB continues to provide for consumers.

	<TEXT> No, it was not just that he was lovey-dovey but that he somehow also lost his intelligence. That did not happen with Rita, Lila or Lumen. Although, Deb should have caught him and Lumen.  It would have set the show up on a better path. Instead, the writers inexplicably made him a moron while being in love with Hannah. I'm sure you already heard others explain why it was horrible and I don't want to rehash a laundry list of examples. I will just leave you with this:

	<TEXT> Sorry, I disagree completely. It really was that bad. The whole Hannah and Argentina storyline was stupid. Oliver Saxon was another run-of-the-mill big bad serial killer. Elway was pointless. Just because they did the opposite of what most fans wanted, does not make it creative. Turning Dexter into a lovestruck, bumbling buffoon was the worst thing they could have done and was a real disservice to the fans.  </TEXT>
