	<TEXT> Poo roulette. 
I was out with my, relatively new, girlfriend and her mates. After a night of heavy pre-drinking we made our way to a bar. As soon as we left my stomach was churning. I had recently become addicted to hot sauce and burritos which weren't helping. I knew I made a mistake of not relieving myself at the house. 

At the bar, I do a great job loosening pressure with some well placed farts and many urinal visits. Two urinals and a toilet that was a single stall which was always full and completely covered in piss and shit. I was fearful of exploring that route. 

On our way out I make everyone wait for me at the front while I release some urine induced pressure. During, I fight to rid of a stubborn fart. Red faced I unleash a huge wet shit right into my underwear. I can only assume the guy beside me heard and smelt this which caused him to evacuate. I waddled to the stall, praying no one else came in, ripped off my undies and slammed dunked 'em in the trash. 

Any of the earlier stinks I had laid could have been the bullet in my game of poop roulette.

I walk out with one layer of separation and no one the wiser. </TEXT>
