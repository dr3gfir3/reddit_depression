	<TEXT> First comment in this reddit, dunno if I'll be of assistance.  
When you put the PC together, did you try running it with just the bare essentials in (e.g. no GFX or anything extra) or did you put it all in at once? Second, have you tried switching the socket the PC is in? One of the builds I did a few months ago had the same problem, but was apparently resolved when we switched the power lead to a new socket. It seemed to be power based anyway, and my guess is that this problem is to do with power or connections to power switches.  
Hope I can be of some help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wasn't sure if this was the right place to post, I thought about r/gamingpc.  
I am a fairly experienced computer builder, have built my own PC up from scratch and am constantly trying to update it when I have the money. Right now, I have ~200 that I am looking to spend on a new GPU, to replace my 560 1GB. With regards to recent driver updates from AMD, and a lack of (from a cursory google search) a decent game-based benchmark, which would be the better good card for the next few years? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not me but my dad - When he was at college in the year before he went to Uni, a group of his friends and him managed to brick up a teacher's door, wallpaper his room with children's wallpaper (He hated children), and perfectly lift and place his car so that there was 1 inch clearance in a soccer goal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd start small, with the paper on toilet rolls. People would swear they'd just changed it, but the little cardboard tube would say otherwise. Then when they go to change it, it feels like it's there. Some would probably wipe. Others would change it.    
I'd work up to planes though. Mid flight, the flight attendants say, "We're experiencing some turbulence. Please return to your seats and fasten seatbelts". Then, and only then, would I turn everything but the seats in the plane invisible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This, a thousand times. I think it's so important to sample different things and have a go at stuff. Even not food related, it's a great life tip to take away. If you don't like it, you don't have to have it again. That combined with alcohol taught me that I don't really like it, and it wasn't taboo for me. It never had the appeal that it had with other people at school, and so I never got wasted, or drunk.    

As a side note, my dad and I very rarely order the same thing at an exotic restaurant because we always try new stuff, which is nice :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think of it like velcro. The air, which in this example represents the hooks on the velcro, is moving across the water's surface. The water molecules are like felt balls, jumping around with some energy.  
If a ball jumps high enough, and there is space for it on the velcro, it is picked up by this velcro surface.  
If the puddle has a large surface area, meaning these balls are spread out more, rather than being stacked, the velcro can pick these up much faster because more of them can jump up and attach themselves.  
And if the velcro is moving quickly across the surface, there's a lot more free space for the balls to latch on, so the puddle dries up quicker.
      
But if the velcro isn't moving very fast, and there's already a lot of felt balls attached to the velcro, the other ones can't latch on. This is called **saturation**. Also, if the balls aren't jumping very much because they're not very energetic, they won't attach to the velcro, meaning the puddle won't dry up.  I hope this answers your question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I swear by my Turtle Beach x12s. Very reasonable price, the sound quality is pretty good and they've got extra bass. The cord is 16' long so that's not a problem (I can go to the toilet while listening to music). Not sure whether you're looking for something with Dolby Surround sound, but you can get Turtle Beaches with DSS included. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would give everyone in the world one small chunk of gold, say ~5g, and see what everyone would do with it. Whether people would band together to make an object, like a figure or a piece of jewellery. Who would save theirs for when times were bad, or sell it immediately to the highest bidder. It would be an interesting experiment. </TEXT>
