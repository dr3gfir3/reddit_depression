	<TEXT> I'm asking this specifically because of the Bautista/Odor fight that occurred yesterday.  Considering that this is assault, why aren't these folks arrested? When there is an intentional beaning, why isn't this considered assault? I understand that the player would have to file charges so it would probably never happen but why isn't there an arrest? Why is it ignored? Same goes for Hockey, football, etc.   For those unaware, here is a link discussing it.  http://www.si.com/mlb/2016/05/15/rangers-blue-jays-brawl-jose-bautista-rougned-odor-punch </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-05-06 18:02:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Happy Friday all! About 2 weeks ago I posted a question asking about tea preferences. The original thread can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4g5dsz/english_tea_question_and_preferences/).  

I wanted everyone to know that I chose [Yorkshire Tea (Red Box)](http://imgur.com/RcP31oP). I took everyone's advice although I steeped it for 5-10 minutes as I prefer a stronger flavor, used 2% milk and not that hated and much maligned cream/half and half.  Regrettably, since I don't have regular sugar in the house, I used some Sweet and Low and it isn't horrible.

And it is really damn tasty!! Thanks everyone!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, I'm a Yank but found myself learning to really appreciate British Tea while I was deployed to Al Udeid AFB in Qatar a few years back. The Brit's that I worked with let me try some [Yorkshire Red](http://www.englishteastore.com/yoredtea80te.html) and I fell in love with its taste and since then have always tried to have some available.

That being said, what other recommendations would ya'll make when it comes to a tasty and preferably darker type of tea?  Also, how would you recommend making it? Milk vs Cream or even Half and Half, sugar vs sugar substitutes, etc, etc, etc.  Thanks!!\

Edit to add Half and Half.

Edit #2:  This has been an awesome read!! Thank you everyone for your opinions!! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-03-25 19:50:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll try to make this short and sweet. Things in our marriage have been on life support for quite a while and the home environment was pretty hostile. I was constantly being shit on. That being said, I've always wanted to try to make things work, if not for us, for our daughter.  

A little over a year ago, I retired from the Navy and the only job I could find that could continue to pay all the bills and the mortgage was in Alaska (I live in Virginia). So, I moved up there and have been here since then to not include a 2 week vacation in September.

Earlier this week I was offered a well paying part time job back in the area that my family lives. When I called to talk to her about it, she told me she wanted a divorce and that if I came back home, I wouldn't be able to live in the house and would have to find an apartment, which would negate any financial gains that would come about with me moving home.

So, my question is, and I understand this isn't a legal advice sub, do any of you know if she is able to keep me out of the house that I pay the mortgage on and have in my name? The only reason she would want to do this is for the 1 year separation requirement that Virginia has but I never agreed to a legal separation. 

Thanks for any help or advice. This is very new as we have been married for 13 years. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-03-18 01:46:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was once a Pallbearer at a funeral in Wisconsin during the winter and it was cold as shit with alot of snow and ice on the ground. As we were carrying the coffin down the stairs, one of the pallbearers slipped and fell down which caused all of us to lose our grip and the coffin fell onto the icy sidewalk.

The thing is, it didn't just sit there on the ground but it started sliding down the front walk (the church was on a hill, in the middle of the town) and it went out the front gate. Now we are all chasing this coffin down the street and hill but the damn thing just kept picking up speed and momentum and we couldn't catch up to it.
At the bottom of the hill there was a drugstore and this coffin slid up the handicapped ramp and through the front door and slid right down the front aisle to the Pharmacy counter where it hit with some force. When it did that, the coffin lid popped open and the body flew forward against the counter, much to the dismay of the pharmacist and his employees.

Then the cadaver looked at the pharmacist and asked "Excuse me sir, do you have something to stop this coffin?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all, quick backround on me. I retired from the Navy December of 2014. I found a job pretty quick and have been working for the National Weather Service in Alaska for a year. Unfortunately, I had to leave my wife and daughter back at my home of residence and desperately want to get back home.
That being said, jobs have opened at a big box store warehouse with a few being management trainee jobs. I retired from the Navy as a Chief Petty Officer and had 10 years of middle management experience. My other resumes have only been National Weather Service related so they aren't very management related. I've worked hard to demilitarize my resume but would love to have some tough love. Thank you.

	<TEXT> I am 48 years old, overweight but in decent condition. I have been focusing the past few months on more cardio (recumbent Bicycle, walking and just starting to jog - They don't have much where I live). I am now going to start getting into more body weight exercises and Kettlebell workouts.  I am not looking to bulk up but instead to slim down and tone.

My history with working out is that after I am finished, I crave carbs and sugar bad.  Therefore, I want a recovery supplement that can help my muscles recover while helping defeat that cravings.  Any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been reading through Volume 2 and a bit of history jumped out at me. I found it fascinating. 

"I'm reading through Volume 2 where they discuss funerals and burying the dead (this is in Appalachia back in the 30's and 40's, maybe even earlier). The old timers were quoted as saying " Th'family didn't have t'pay nothin'. They dug th'grave free of charge. Men went together and dug th'grave. And you made th'buryin' clothes, and you made th'box t'be buried in, and there wasn't no payin' goin' on. Th'preacher never charged for a funeral-for preachin' a funeral. They'll charge for funerals now, preachers will. They're not supposed to. See, most preachers is paid by salary, and that's one of his jobs. he ain't supposed t'charge y'. but many of'em'll take anything". 

Isn't it something how communities pulled together for the greater good? </TEXT>
