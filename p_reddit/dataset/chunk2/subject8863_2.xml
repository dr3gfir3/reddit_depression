	<TEXT> While Scientology is a cult they know how to play the system well. They obtained their tax exemption from the IRS by having P.I.s dig into the personal lives of IRS managers initiating hundreds of lawsuits against IRS employees. Eventually Scientology offered to drop all suits for religious tax exemption and the US government caved.

Let us take this as an example of what to do to Congressmen, Senators, the state department, the department of Homeland security, the IRS, and the Department of Defense under the Trump Occupation.

I think there should be lawsuits and calls for ethics violations on all them from a class action of people. I think this is something we should highly organize. Lawsuits for Ethical Government Justice. They should never have been allowed to vote on someone who donated to them. It flying in the face of impartiality and shows direct bias.

There is no photoshopping or image edits to this image. This is what the guy actually looks like. Like someone hit him in the face with a shovel and he woke up in an alley after drinking bottom shelf malt liquor all night for 20 years.  He also writes all of Donald Trump's executive orders, Including the Muslim ban one. He also has installed himself into a seat of power  over military leaders and kicked them out of a closed door security council which can choose who to kill who are actual american citizens which is not even recorded for later record with an Executive Order Donald Trump didn't even read or briefed on what was in it before signing it. Donald Trump was then very mad after finding out in the leaks coming out of the white house.

Bannon is also obsessed about a book that is about the 20 year cycle of american history in four part cycle. Based on a theory by authors William Strauss and Neil Howe they believe that the US History comes in four cycles. High, Awakening, Unraveling, and Crisis. Crisis is always lead by some major cataclysmic war in example World War 2, The civil war.  Bannon is intent on seeing though this idea and wants us to go to world war with China with bloody results because he is in a doomsday like mindset that we are on the tipping point of Crisis cycle and it his job to invoke it and destroy america to rebuild it in a nationalistic jingoistic white supremacist image he envisions.

A friend of mine wrote this part and I'm posting it below for you to read.


###The Battle Ahead###

major conflict looming for western democracies; it will likely devolve into world war. It could come in a matter of days or weeks; or perhaps, if we are lucky, growing awareness of the path we are on could forestall it. Regardless, the consequences are significant and it will affect everyone.

This will be disturbing to read and you may be tempted to discard it; I encourage you to give it a chance.
Since the end of World War II, the west has settled into an ossified and brittle peace. The conventional wisdom is that a mix of democracy, technology, trade, tolerance, capitalism, a social safety net, and open borders are a sure-fire recipe for sustained economic growth and continuous improvement of society.

In broad measures, this has been true: the world is safer, and the number of people living in poverty keeps dropping. We have managed to build a world that is more connected and open than ever before, and arguably civilization has achieved a peak that could only have been dreamed of 100 or 150 years ago.
But there are serious problems that have festered, mostly unchecked:

1. Crony capitalism has created enormous wealth for a few, but at the expense of many. Using asymmetric information, capitalism has been rendered "risk free" for the well connected: privatizing upside gains while socializing downside risk.
2. Inequality is a major problem. We have built structural racism and white supremacy into our institutions. Instead of slavery or Jim Crow, we now enslave people through economics. Whether you want to cite high price cell phones targeted at the underbanked, or bail bonds, or the unfair lending practices, many black, brown and other minorities are unfairly targeted by an unlevel playing field, day after day.
3. Our politics has become arrogant, ossified, and stale. The fact that we just conducted a presidential election with a few dozen dull primary contenders, and finished it up with a battle between three relics from the culture wars gives a good sense that we have run out of new blood. Our parties are in disarray, and really, don't know what they are actually about anymore.

So onto this stage of general progress, but diminished, weakened political culture walks Stephen Bannon.
Bannon's background is well documented. But the most important thing to know about Bannon is his penchant for drama  and his obsession with the book "The Fourth Turning."

Written in 1997 by the historians Strauss and Howe, it aims to describe the cyclical nature of generational history. They posit that there are "turns" of roughly 20 years that define all of modern human history. They have studied it in detail, and their observations largely ring true.
Whether or not you believe their theory, it is important to know that Bannon does. And he seems to be taking it as a kind of literal gospel, enacting its prognostications with Biblical zeal.

He appears to believe that he is a historical figure charged to take on the task of provoking the "Fourth Turning" that the book predicts  but which largely has not taken place, though arguably some early signs are present.

But Bannon has asserted that the Fourth Turning has begun. And, in this, Bannon is perhaps quantitatively right: Western democracies have been signaling that something is very wrong, with about 50% of voters selecting candidates and platforms that represent a sharp break from our incremental, progressive past.
But here's the thing: Strauss and Howe suggest that this "Crisis" phase of the Fourth Turning will almost certainly result in authoritarian, absolutist rule  as the outcome of a total, decisive war. They suggest that minorities will be targeted and demonized. And that dissent will not be tolerated.

That may be an observation one can make about generational cycles in the past, but it is in on the wrong side of modern history and the enlightenment, whose arc does bend toward justice.

So it would seem that Bannon, who is a provocateur, a showman, a horrible white nationalist, and an all around Rasputin-like figure, is using the book as a kind of historical "excuse" to pursue his agenda: "it will happen anyway," he might argue. He's just here to provoke the inevitable.
And in one thing he is right: our brittle, ossified Western democracies are due for a reset and a good kick in the pants. We need to get serious about fixing the serious structural flaws that people very rightly are concerned about. We need to plan for what a world without work might look like.

And fixing this could even be violent, depending on what forces are unleashed.
But no matter what, this entry can never be an excuse for Steve Bannon (along with his backers, Robert and Rebekah Mercer) to pursue a white nationalist and authoritarian agenda for the world's most powerful democracy.
With each passing day, he is enacting measures that aggravate (a term used in Fourth Turning) societys fault lines and push it closer to the brink of collapse. Installing members of his network (DeVos) in cabinet posts; the travel ban (affecting at least 100,000 people in its first days); giving banks more leverage by undoing Dodd-Frank; we could go on and on, and were only two weeks in.
His intentions are not what they seem on the surface; his true intention is to push a fragile, interconnected, and complex society to actually collapse  so that it can be rebuilt in *his* image. I ask simply: is this what you want? Did you vote for this? Did anyone vote for *this*?

So now, the challenge: there are three options.

1. either the forces of conflict are already unleashed, and we will fall into a brutal nonlinear war where Bannon's darkest fantasies are fulfilled, or
2. the forces of conflict are already unleashed, and we take responsibility for the failings of democracy, and fight to preserve our values of openness, tolerance, and free speech, even in the face of brutal conflict, or
3. we have not yet hit the point of no return, and can still use our institutions to flush out the threat that Bannon poses, while seriously addressing the vulnerability he aimed to exploit.

There is no workable alternative. We each must choose whether we will protect the values this country was founded on, and we must do so now. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here is a the basic run down about the Trump, Russia hacking and blackmail by Putin connections; why Putin is controlling Trump as a "Useful idiot" and potentially how from what I have gathered. If you want to know why, Here goes

1) Trump owes Blackstone/ Bayrock group $560 million dollars (one of his largest debtors and the primary reason he won't reveal his tax returns)

2) Blackstone is owned wholly by Russian billionaires, who owe their position to Putin and have made billions from their work with the Russian government.

3) Other companies that have borrowed from Blackstone have claimed that owing money to them is like owing to the Russian mob and while you owe them, they own you for many favors.

4) The Russian economy is badly faltering under the weight of its over-dependence on raw materials which as you know have plummeted in the last 2 years leaving the Russian economy scrambling to pay its debts.

5) Russia has an impetus to influence our election to ensure the per barrel oil prices are above $65 ( they are currently hovering around $50)

6) Russia can't affordably get at 80% of its oil reserves and reduce its per barrel cost to compete with America at $45 or Saudi Arabia at $39. With Iranian sanctions being lifted Russia will find another inexpensive competitor increasing production and pushing Russia further down the list of suppliers. As for Iranian sanctions, the 6 countries lifting them allowing Iran to collect on the billions it is owed for pumping oil but not being paid for it. These billions Iran can only get if the Iranian nuclear deal is signed. Trump spoke of ending the deals which would cause oil sales sanctions to be reimposed, which would make Russian oil more competitive.

7) Rex Tillerson (Trump's pick for Secretary of State) is the head of ExxonMobil, which is in possession of patented technology that could help Putin extract 45% more oil at a significant cost savings to Russia, helping Putin put money in the Russian coffers to help reconstitute its military and finally afford to mass produce the new and improved systems that it had invented before the Russian economy had slowed so much.

8) Putin cannot get access to these new cost saving technologies OR outside oil field development money, due to US sanctions on Russia, because of its involvement in Ukrainian civil war.

9) Look for Trump to end sanctions on Russia and to back out of the Iranian nuclear deal, to help Russia rebuild its economy, strengthen Putin and make Tillerson and Trump even richer, thus allowing Trump to satisfy his creditors at Blackstone.

10) With Trump's fabricated hatred of NATO and the U.N., the Russian military reconstituted, the threat to the Baltic states is real. Russia retaking their access to the Baltic Sea from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and threatening the shipping of millions of cubic feet of natural gas to lower Europe from Scandinavia, would allow Russia to make a good case for its oil and gas being piped into eastern Europe. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-12-26 02:05:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wanted to post something about her.

This morning my mother, [Name Removed], passed away peacefully at home in her bed with my dad, sister [Name Removed] and her husband / my brother in law [Name Removed] by her side in [Location Removed]. She had been battling numerous health issues since I was a young teenager, but for the past five years it had finally taken it's toll.

She gave me a passion for the sciences and arts, explaining how even with learning disabilities she won the International Science and Engineering Fair in [Year Removed] in [Location Removed], doing meticulous research, lab notes, and experimentation with fruit flies finding the effects of different degrees of radiation on multiple generations of their offspring. She read to me and my sisters endlessly. She gave us our voracious passion for classical literature and modern lit. She taught my sisters, I, many other children, and young adults the passion for theater and the spoken arts when she was a theater professor. She had us learn to talk with marbles in our mouths and a cork between our teeth for proper diction. She instilled in us a love for British theater and it's history of as she had studied for grad school dramatic arts in London, England and being a student usher at The Old Vic Theatre. I grew up with her telling stories and sharing pictures with friends of her adventures hanging out with the likes of Sir John Gielgud, Sir Laurence Olivier, and auditioning for theater academy programs in London alongside the likes of Carrie Fisher.

She taught me the importance of groups like the ACLU and how everyone should have the right to public free speech, but she also taught me that speech will always have a price. She taught me the importance of Civil Rights and equal protections under the law for all people and what feminism means. The taught me that it only gets better for yourself if you fight for everyone to be able to have those same rights and protections. She instilled my very core of political ideas. She gave me a love for good scotch. She gave me my dark gallows humor that's for certain.

She was an educator, a thespian, and my mom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm 32 years old. My mom has been in an out of the hospital since I was 14 due to a complications from a condition called ArnoldChiari malformation. Her health took a serious decline after a fall a few years ago and since 2010 she has been in and out of the hospital and nursing homes since then. But finally she is going to die. She checked herself out with my family back in Maryland, with me living in Portland Oregon with my fiancee.

I before I moved from Maryland to Los Angeles 3 years ago I took care of my mom for my dad because she was in the medicare gap period. She was wasn't old enough for medicare but my dad couldn't afford the nurse for her. I was working from home as a slave wage tech / blogger journalist so my life was pretty much open. So i moved home and took care of my mom. After she got back on her feet at the time I had to move. I moved to Los Angeles met my fiance, was able to go back to school with a disability status I have for Depression / Bipolar and then after some time I moved to Portland with my Fiancee. I have had a pretty decent year with a great software engineering internship but it seems after winter shit hits the fan and my own depression started to hit hard, my internship ended early due to team members demanding to move back to Ireland after the election, and pretty much just feeling like failure.

My sister and dad calling me about my mom who is now high on morphine because of the pain she is in and under hospice care is a nice cherry on the top of the shit mountain that was 2016. I want to get drunk, i want to run away, I want to scream. I feel like everything I thought about and cared about is destroyed. I'm just lucky I have my Fiancee and have her love. But fuck this whole thing, fuck it all! </TEXT>

 20% tax on all imported goods 

 If we want jobs in America, we need to enact my 5-part tax policy: kill the death tax; lower the tax rates on capital gains   dividends; eliminate corporate taxes in order to create more American jobs; mandate a 15% tax for outsourcing jobs and a 20% tax for importing goods, and enact the 1-5-10-15 income tax plan [four brackets with a top rate of 15%].
Government needs to stop pick-pocketing your wallet. Every time it does, it slows growth and kills jobs. It's also immoral.

Source: Time to Get Tough, by Donald Trump, p. 65 , Dec 5, 2011


 In an interview with the New York Times editorial board, Trump said he would support a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States.

In a Republican debate, his then-presidential rival Ted Cruz brought up his past comments on trade. Trump responded, "The 45-percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell."

	<TEXT> I really don't get the point of this destroyer. Besides looking cool do we even really need it? I mean we don't fight naval wars, America has a ton of other ships already, its not like anyone else has the same kind of firepower. I just don't get it. It seems like it was just a graft project to look cool and sell them to other people down the road. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Two weeks ago early in the morning at 7am while me an my fiancee were packing for a trip and getting ready for work that day someone came into our apartment. We were both naked and while I was in the bathroom my fiancee was in the living room. The person was fuddling with the lock with out even knocking and then unlocked the door and came in. My fiancee wasn't wearing her glasses so while the person saw her fully naked she couldn't see them. I heard him go, "OH, i'm sorry!" shocked and turns and run. 

I ran to the door, but naked couldn't follow down the hall as I saw his backside as he entered the stairs entry and b line out.

What makes it worse he my fiancee then got dressed and went downstairs to walk our dog real quick, leaving the door unlocked. I was in the bathroom after getting dressed myself and heard someone locking the door but though it was her. Five minutes later when she came back the door was locked. And I had to come and unlock it.

My fiancee was so freaked out by this that she had us take our dog with us when I took her to work, i came back to wait till the apartment office opened at 10am to talk to the staff. I ran into the new building service manager though first and let him know what happened and he was actually really apologetic and said that it could have been a vendor who was supposed to clean the same apartment number but in building A, not our building B.

30 minutes later I went to the office after it opened to be confronted by a replacement office / apartment manager, as ours was out on vacation. She said it was impossible what I said had happened. That they had all the vendor keys and no one could have come in and I must have left the door unlocked. She was highly on the defensive. I never even mentioned vendor keys though and she was the first to say it wasn't their vendors. 

Fast forward to this last weekend after I got back from a work trip and my fiancee had come with me. I send an email to the apartment manager so there is a paper trail explaining what happened and I was then informed I should have told them sooner. The manager has been nothing but helpful normally but I lost it. How on earth was she never informed about this unscheduled intrusion? My fiancee now doesn't feel safe at this apartment anymore and we have already found a new place. 

The question is what should I do now? 

Is there a way to get out of having to pay the lease breaking fee since someone entered without permission or knocking? Do I file a police report? The only people who have touched our door and lock are my fiancee, dog, and I since the incident. So who ever touched the lock to unlock it for a vendor key, which is the only logical answer, since they had to come back to re-lock it. Turns out a feature of the locks in are apartment is that if a vendor key is used to unlock a door only a vendor key can re-lock it. 

I'm in Washington County (Hillsboro), Oregon outside of Portland.

	<TEXT> So the reason I bought a playstation2, PS3 slim, and will buy a ps4 neo when it comes out is besides playing a few console exclusive only games I used it for a pretty reliable bluray player. Is there anyone else that does this ? I dont know of any UHD 4k bluray playback yet for pc so HTPC will not have that for sometime .

What is your views on this?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So it seems more and more companies are coming out with nonspec thunderbolt 3 devices to provide past 100watt limit for power. What do you personally think about this for the spec and how this will either limit it or force it to upgrade? I would love to see the spec get a dedicated power option that can hold at most 120 watts this might mean thunderbolt 4 high power special cables then but something that forces a standard. HP, Dell, and Lenovo all have docks that don't follow spec to provide power to their own laptops. Now does this mean third party cables won't provide power now ?  </TEXT>
