	<TEXT> **Update:**  
I was able to access it via windows explorer (for now).  I still can't get into the web interface (saying it's not there).  When I open any file or document in the NAS, there is the 1-5 minute delay.  
  
Here's the kicker.  I copied all important files to a local drive, and the transfer rate of the files were blazing fast.  Then backed up offsite (still fast).  
  
So the issue remains accessing the NAS interface, and finding why the files create such a lag.  But copying/moving/browsing files causes no lag. 
  
If anyone knows of a reason or fix for this, I'm all ears.

	<TEXT> Ive been able to make a copy of the data.  What I'm noticing is, that every time I try to open up any time of file (document, spreadsheet, pdf, etc.) the system hangs up for 1-3 minutes.  But copying over files is seamless and fast.  At least the important files will be backed up and accessible.  But I still have to fix the NAS.
  
This slowness, or delay in items opening, is what I noticed earlier today prior to my issues.  At that time i thought a power down and power up of the NAS would help, but that's where my problems got worse.  So in essence, I feel like I'm at the start again.  And have no way to get into the Admin settings of the NAS.

I am able to access via the mapped network drive.  However, when I attempt to connect to the web interface, I still get the same errors (thus I have no control over the NAS).  My Synology Assistant does show the server, but even trying to connect through that gives me the error.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In summary:  
 A female customer and her daughter were afraid to enter the restroom due the males presence there, and a security guard reporting to the Employee directed the man to leave and use the mens room. The man left, claiming to be a female, before then complaining to the store officials about being asked to leave.

The employee was later talked to the assistant store manager, and was told the store policy.  The employee stated that he had just learned of the policy and even though it didn't agree with his religious beliefs, he would enforce Macy's policy.  

However, Macy's wouldn't let this end there, the Employee was then called into a meeting with HR who suspended him and then fired him.  

According to a legal complaint, the retailer terminated Chavez even though he had not previously been made aware that Macys allowed transgender individuals to use the bathroom of their choice, and also in spite of the fact Chavez had promised to uphold the policy while working. His case is now before the New York State Division of Human Rights.

After my employer learned that I was a practicing Catholic, with religious concerns about this policy, I was terminated because of my religion, in violation of the New York State Human Rights Law, Chavez states in his complaint. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, storrmwater management is one of the topics of this subreddit.  
  
Can you give a little more detail into the situation?  Waterflow, perennial/intermittent streams, size of area, what caused the amount of water (was it a storm, if so size of storm inches/hr) etc.  With more information, we can hopefully point you in the right direction and give you more insight.

Acting on instinct, Steele cut the fawn from its mother. A veteran of several calf deliveries, he then wiped it down with his sweater, cleared out its air channels with his fingers and even sprinkled grass onto the fawns nose to get it to sneeze. Tickling a newborn ungulates nasal passage is standard procedure on a cattle farm, as it allows the animal to breathe by clearing mucous from its airway.

	<TEXT> Because social media is a fraction of the cost, and free sometimes.  One can't compare the money spent on traditional media compared to modern day media.  

30 second ad on tv can cost millions.  3 minute video on YouTube, Vimeo, etc is practically free - other than production costs.  

Obama was clever enough to work both mediums, traditional and print for the older generations and blitzed social media for the youth.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, no I would not go.  

However, with that being said, I would offer to 11-12 graders only.  It's not just the "taboo" feeling of it, but on the emotional side of life, it can be rough even for the most mature child. 

I remember a group going to the zoo vet.  When they took the kids into the room and started to talk about what happens when the animals die, many left and some felt mild emotional trauma.  Mind you, this was for 6-8 graders. 

I would definitely have waivers set up.   </TEXT>
