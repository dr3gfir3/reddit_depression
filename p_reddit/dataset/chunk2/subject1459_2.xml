	<TEXT> What lessons do you think were missing? It is a kids movie after-all. I know Ekman came up with the 6 basic emotions based on cross-cultural research and looking into facial expressions. But that's a relatively basic and out-dated breakdown of emotions. I figured the movie used it for simplicity more than anything else, because it would be a lot harder to have a coherent movie with 100+ different emotions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that's fair. When I do go to bars these days, I usually like smaller ones - where I can actually sit at the bar and hear people talk, not have to stand among hundreds of people and then weasel my way to the bar every time I want a drink. What type of bars do your friends go to? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How come whenever people talk about socializing it's always a big "party" or a fancy "bar?" As someone with social anxiety, there's nothing I enjoy more on a weekend than having a couple buddies over, having a couple beers, playing billiards, and watching a movie or sports game. 

I bet it's not the exact activity that you miss doing, it's just the fact that you could've done *something* with *someone* - but you didn't. My recommendation is to find more low-key ways of socializing, or friends who don't always have to "go out" all the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many approaches for dealing with negative and intrusive thoughts. This just describes one attitude to take, but it's certainly not meant to be a cure-all. It's a perspective that has helped *me* personally, but it won't work for everyone. Obviously some people have such low impulse control that there is very little that can be done outside of professional supervision.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are different types of meditation designed for different things. Here are a few of the main ones:

- **Mindfulness Meditation:** Cultivating awareness of the present moment through active focus and concentration (such as focusing on your breathing). This meditation can improve "mindfulness" of other daily activities, which is why mindfulness is a separate thing from "mindfulness meditation."

- **Contemplative Meditation:** Thinking/reflecting/contemplating ideas. This type of meditation is mostly verbal and not so much focused on cultivating awareness of the present (though you can be *mindful of thinking*, which is slightly different than *active contemplation*).

- **Metta Meditation ("Loving Kindness"):** Often this meditation is focused on repeating different types of mantras like "I wish all beings find happiness" or "I wish all beings become free from suffering" etc. It could also include elements of visualization (imagining the faces of people in your head as you repeat each mantra).

There are different types of mantra meditations and visualization meditations. Your "guided meditation for weight loss" is probably in this category ("visualize yourself eating less" or "tell yourself 'I don't need that piece of cake'"), and not necessarily related to cultivating mindfulness. 

I hope this clarified some things. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is one of the big takeaways from Oliver Sacks' book [Hallucinations](http://amzn.to/1B8tRGU).  Sacks does a wonderful job normalizing the experience of hallucinations by making it clear that they arent always a sign of psychosis or mental illness. Instead, hallucinations can come from a variety of sources including migraines, dehydration, starvation, sleep deprivation, psychedelic use, and extreme amounts of stress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I need a little more detail before I can give specific suggestions. In general, good advice is to identify the small ways you can be more social and "put yourself out there." But this all depends on...

- How old are you?

- How often do you socialize currently? Where do you go?

- What's your group of friends like? Do you have one or 2 close buds?

- What kind of things do you like to do? Hobbies? Interests?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing I've slowly realized over the past few years is this: liberals aren't more tolerant than conservatives, they are just tolerant of different things. 

Jonathan Haidt's [The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided By Politics and Religion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307455777/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 camp=1789 creative=390957 creativeASIN=0307455777 linkCode=as2 tag=theemomac-20 linkId=OGAEFDIPREJ3HRP2) goes over this beautifully. He describes how everyone has their own moral impulses, and liberals and conservatives tend to get moral impulses from different "moral taste buds."

One example is while liberals have a moral taste bud for "equality" and "egalitarianism," conservatives have a moral taste bud for "authority" and "order." Neither is necessarily seen as right or wrong, it's a difference in *preferences* (or "moral tastes").

Haidt - a self-proclaimed progressive - does a great job at describing conservative morality in a non-biased way, and actually admits by the end of the book that he's learned that "liberal morality" doesn't always apply to all types of people and cultures.

Honestly, this book is *essential* reading if you want to become a more self-critical liberal or progressive. You can also get a good taste for some of his ideas in this lecture: [Why So Many Americans Don't Want Social Justice and Don't Trust Scientists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86dzTFJbkc)

	<TEXT> Depression is an actual illness, not an event or state of mind.

Depression is definitely a real illness. But it's experienced moment-to-moment like everything else - and even as a depressed person you get your share of "ups" and "downs".

I don't mean to trivialize depression. I understand it can be a chronic illness for many and it never completely goes away. 

I do think it helps however to look at all of our passing "moods" (including "moods" experienced by someone with depression) as different phases that are always changing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This quote couldn't be further from the truth. 

Republican rhetoric is often explicitly about economic issues rather than social issues ("cutting waste" + "tax breaks" are front and center on anyone's platform). The only reason they talk about social issues at all is because they are constantly being attacked from the left ("Republicans don't really care about minorities and women" is a common selling point for Democrats).

This is because Republicans are generally "out of touch" and unfavorable on social issues (they've already lost on gay marriage, and are losing on pro-choice). If they had their way, they would probably avoid talking about social issues entirely (especially race and gender).

EDIT: Is /r/worldpolitics not familiar with American politics? Or is reddit just really that knee-jerk "Bernie Sanders is right about literally everything."

	<TEXT> Americans see themselves as temporarily inconvenienced millionaires. 

This is a very common phrase that originates from a [fake Steinbeck quote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck#Disputed). 

Unfortunately, most people even use this fake quote out of context. The original quote actually points out how most "socialists" / "communists" are privileged upper middle class:

"Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?' Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property.

"I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. **Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knewat least they claimed to be Communistscouldn't have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic. Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves.**" 

Ever since the Frankfurt school, most socialists realized that you could never bring socialism through revolution, because most people in America were just too wealthy and comfortable already. </TEXT>

So your disagreement is the use of the word "hard?" Or do you have another definition of mindfulness that you prefer? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What, no one is saying we should get rid of that and all the research that suggests free will is illusory isn't conclusive. Why is there a trend in psychology, it seems to me, lately that wants to disprove free will?

I agree the trend to disprove free will is concerning, that's not what I intended when it comes to "Cognitive Agency." I just think it's misleading to say we have *complete* control over our thoughts. 

But at the end of the day, I'm a compatibilist. There's a way to acknowledge our limits of cognitive agency and square it with "free will" - I like the term [free won't](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/free-wont-why-you-shouldnt-take-any-single-thought-too-seriously). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All mental activity correlates with changes in the brain.* The article doesn't dispute that, so there is no need to evoke  mind/body dualism.

The point being made isn't a metaphysical one, but an epidemiological one. While genes and biology can influence the onset of many disorders, it's also true that psychological, social, and environmental factors can influence the onset of disorders too.

For example, "addiction" - while some people can be more biologically prone to it than others - is largely a "learned disorder." It's often caused and perpetuated by your childhood, your habits, and your environment. Ignoring these factors is going to make it hard to treat the disorder.

	<TEXT> The existence of a claim can not be used as evidence of the claim being made. Me saying "I own a dragon" is not evidence that I own a dragon.

Testimonial evidence is weak evidence, but it is evidence. Certainly with an extraordinary claim like "I own a dragon," it doesn't hold much weight.

However, when people tell me "I have a dog," I usually assume they are telling me the truth, but that's not as wild of a claim so it's easy to take that "weak evidence" and assume it's true. 

Testimonials are certainly considered evidence in court. But yes, they are incredibly prone to error - which is why skepticism, interrogating, and cross-examination are needed to. The same could be said about the role of testimonials in science.

(The statement "I have a dog" mixed with the knowledge that 1. Dogs exist, and 2. People commonly own dogs as pets, makes the testimonial fairly trustworthy. Unless the person is a pathological liar, it's safe to say they are being honest.)

Stories at face value can be very misleading. But I believe stories corroborated with other evidence can add something to the pool of understanding.

	<TEXT> Yeah, the "anti-anecdote" part seems to be the one that most people have a problem with.

I totally understand that personal observations are biased and the whole point of science is to protect against these biases. That's basic philosophy of science to me. I get it.

However, I don't see this as a reason to dismiss all anecdotes at face value. So often people tell about their own experiences with depression, anxiety, or mental illnesses and people just dismiss it as, "Well, that's just anecdotal evidence."

Yes, it's true that anecdotes are not as robust of observations as measurements and statistics. They certainly could never *replace* or *invalidate* a scientific study. For example, I hate when people respond to a study and say, "Well I'm X, and Y isn't true for me! Therefore this study is wrong!" That's not what I mean here. 

**However, I think people's personal experiences can *add* to scientific research. Especially when personal experiences *fit* with statistical data, it can often give us a little more context. We get a chance to see how certain principles "play out in the real world." And that can be insightful.**

I wish I could give a specific example.  But consider Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow" or any good book on psychology. Yes there are studies, and statistics, and theoretical concepts. But there are also many *stories* that elucidate those scientific principles. 

It's one thing to know what the "planning fallacy" is, it's another thing to hear some examples of the way it can manifest itself. Like when Kahneman talks about him and his team overestimating how quickly they could finish a new textbook. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree wholeheartedly. 

I think your sleeping schedule should fit your biology and personality. "Night owls" and "early birds" are sleep preferences that are at least partly influenced by genetics (actually some [research](http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/youve-heard-of-owls-and-larks-now-sleep.html) shows there 4 different sleep chronotypes).

Also, even as an early bird myself who likes to be productive in the morning, I naturally wake up around 7-8am. 

There's no reason for me to *force* myself to wake up earlier, I get plenty of waking hours throughout the day and I get within the recommended range of sleep hours. 

I remember having to wake up at 6am for school and it was awful for me. I hated needing an alarm and not waking up naturally. Just being forced to wake up 1.5 hours before my "natural" wake up time through me completely off for the rest of the day. I never really adapted to it during my school days.

Now I've been sleeping without an alarm or forced sleep schedule for years now, and it's become a very natural and steady pattern (typically go to bed at 11pm-12am on weekdays and wake up between 730am-830am). My sleep patterns have never been healthier.

If waking up at 5am works for you, great. But I think people's sleep schedules should ideally be shaped by individual differences and preferences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think half of being mindful is just knowing when I'm being distracted.

Sometimes it helps to just step back for a second and ask:

- What am I *trying* to do?
- What am I *actually* doing?

If those things are disconnected, then I need to go back to the present moment.

For example,

- "What am I *trying* to do?" I'm at work and should be focusing on writing this new article. 
- "What am I *actually* doing?" I'm writing a comment on reddit.

Conclusion? Back to focusing on work.

Thanks for the distraction. Bye. :)

	<TEXT> It's difficult. Not impossible. 

Just one anecdotal example, but I used to have a huge fear of flying as a kid. Then when I learned I was engaging in availability bias (it's easier for me to remember a tragic plane crash than a car crash), and found out that statistically planes are actually much safer than cars, my fear had gradually faded away.

I don't know if that's the case for all biases. But I do know some biases can be overcome with the right information and right attitude. Now I don't think "identifying the bias" is the *only* thing you need to do - our minds are a little stickier than that - but it's a good first step.

In general, people change their beliefs all the time. It may not be as common as we'd like, but it happens. People here who identify as "skeptics" are probably more open to this than others. Can you think of anytime you changed your mind about something? I bet you can. </TEXT>

It's definitely true that wrong information can "stick" in our brains even if we are exposed to information that contradicts it. 

If these beliefs are ideological-based (politics/religion), some studies even show beliefs become *stickier* when presented with contradicting evidence (we cling to them harder, sometimes called [the backfire effect](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/)).

As you say, confirmation bias is definitely a big influence here. We tend to focus on information that confirms our beliefs, and ignore information that doesn't.

Another probable influence is [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring): If your first experience hearing about X is learning Y, then that initial knowledge is going to make it harder to integrate new information about X that may not fit Y. This is the closest term I can think of for what you are describing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a fan of Buress, I have to say the show is incredibly underwhelming. It's like a bad mix of stand-up and sketch comedy, with very little sense of direction. It seems like they are just winging it half the time. I know a part of it is supposed to be the "Why?" theme, but this show would probably fit better on late night adult swim or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they are "stigmatized" in the sense that they aren't considered "productive." 

It can be surprisingly hard for people to take time for themselves, even to enjoy the simple things without the thought of, "Hm, I could be getting work done right now" or "I could be doing something more productive." When's the last time you honestly did spend 15-20 minutes watching a sunset?

"Stigmatize" may be a strong word, but I do think the message rings true in some cultures that if we aren't doing something that involves gaining material wealth, then it's ultimately a waste of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I can think of many types of consciousness that are not related to the production and consumption of material goods. 

- Meditating on your breath.

- Watching a sunset. 

- Having a conversation.

- Going for a walk.

- Playing with your kids.

I could go on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All participants chose from a fixed set of traits selected by a US researcher. This is already a source of bias.

Do you have any specific criticism of the sampling? Or do you just really want this study to be misleading and wrong?

Looking at different cultures tells you nothing about whether these cultures represent a good sample of Homo sapiens (potential) diversity or not.

It's not perfect. But a sampling of different cultures is *better* than a sampling of one culture if you want to find something generalizable to homo sapiens. 

Yes, we can talk about self-report bias, sampling bias, stereotype threat, and all of these potential flaws of the study. No single study is going to be perfect. No single study is going to represent a completely "objective picture." And culture, in part, will always play some role in people's attitudes.

But answer me this: what criteria would convince you that these differences in sexual attitudes are (at least in part) innate or biologically influenced?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Studies show that initial attraction can be based on facial symmetry and familiarity, but that doesn't necessarily factor into reasons for mate selection.

The problem with measuring "actual preferences" is that most people don't really know why they make the choices they do, even in hindsight. 

For the most part, however: questionnaires are a valid measure of attitudes, albeit they have limitations.

	<TEXT> I've already conceded this. *Stated* preferences were measured not *demonstrated* preferences.  </TEXT>
