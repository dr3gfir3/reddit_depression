	<TEXT> Ahh cool. I Never knew. I'm got my information from a interesting documentary/experiment that's was done on ch 4 in the uk. It was called "drugs live" back in March. It compared weed with skunk. Most people call skunk weed. I've always classed them separately. But the main difference between the two was skunk is high in thc low in cbd. Weed was high in cbd and low in thc. Obviously thc may be a cannaboid. But think they were referring to them separately. I personally see them as very different too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's Thai weed Or Thai stick. That's what we call it here in uk. Strangely called Thai weed over there too, well not that strange. 
It was good Thai weed but Not very good and not really comparable to skunk tbh. Very high in CBD(cannaboids) but low thc!  What they had on the island was a lot better than what I got in Bangkok. I got pics. Just not sure how to upload pic without uploading as post.  

I smoke Thai weed here aswell as skunk but you just can't compare the two. Like comparing beer   vodka lol.

	<TEXT> Just looks like bit of garbage that's got mixed in! Dealers are not the most hygienic! Probably dirt off table or wherever he was bagging up. Throw   enjoy the smoke. Weed looks good. One off my dealer friends mum used to have loads of cats. Always have to check for cat hairs in his weed bags. But that's got me into a good habit of checking weed as your rolling. If it's not weed then throw it. 
Agree with 1st comment. Needs to be legalised. 

Here in the uk. A lot of Vietnamese are in the growing trade. They don't smoke so don't care about smokers just . Was a period quite few years back of them using. Fine grade sand or something like that to mimic thc. Used to have loads off the stuff at bottom of the bag. Definitely wasn't thc. Very rare now because everyone basically grows or knows a good grower. Most of that shit grown stuff ends up in Scotland or Ireland. No one smoking that crap here(London). So it don't happen anymore,  that I know off  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Phi phi island is where you can smoke openly according to everyone but I still kept it low key! Trust me a lot of people don't. Hot girls in bikinis where just blazing it up. While sun bathing. I chose to hide in the shade. Cops are probably not gonna be as nice to me as they are with them. Still one of the best places I've ever smoked. 

You can hire them boats   driver will pretty much let you do what you want. Thai weed not as good as the skunk I normally smoke.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heard on the radio that Netflix will be live streaming the "jingle bell ball" concert that's been going on in uk/London for a few years now. Hosted by capital fm radio station. It's London radio station. So guessing op doesn't get it, where he lives but this is happening. 

Can't find any details online. I'm sure I heard this over radio. I could've been high, pretty sure I wasn't, unless I was so high I didn't know I was high. Will add more details when I find them. But otherwise trust me. You can always trust internet strangers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People who declaw should not have cats! Feel the same about docked tails in dogs   clipped wings in birds. Just wrong 

And his not Maine coon. Would love to have that breed of cat someday. His normal uk shorthair ginger Tom. He was the runt of the litter so I was told but his still quite big. Forget banana for scale but his 2foot head to tail. (Was gonna make a bad joke bout him being 3 foot lol)

	<TEXT> Thanks for advice but really think if your cat is going to be going outside like all cats should do. Then they will need claws for climbing, fighting etc.  His 9 years old now, only got 3 legs, so don't go out much now but I've never had to cut his nails. He always looked after them himself. Besides no one would be able to cut his nails. I'm sure his evil!

	<TEXT> I never knew! Just thought his an evil cat! 
Had lots of pets dogs, rabbits, snakes, birds but his the only pet I could honestly say is evil. Taken big chunk of flesh out of my mums leg. Attacked every member of family on more than one occasion. His my 1st cat. Love him but couldn't ever trust him. He especially dislikes kids. Only got 3 legs too. Had one removed cause of cancer bout 3 years ago. His still just as evil. Thanks for the info but I'll still be weary of him when petting him. You know, just Incase! </TEXT>
