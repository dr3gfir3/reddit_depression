certain "developers" got lots of publicity when it didn't seem like their developer rsums warranted the publicity.

	<TEXT> I grew up in a medium-sized border town, 80% Hispanic, most of the white population was military, as was my dad. 

Off-base, I got called "gringa" a few times, mostly affectionately. On base, where the demos skewed the other way, I heard some of the most disgusting and ignorant racist garbage. 

I was all but adopted by my best friend's (formerly undocumented) parents despite the language barrier, and I love the cultural emphasis on family togetherness. It's disgusting the stereotypes and inhumanity that so many in our country spew about the Latino community.  </TEXT>

Yes, because collective bargaining has allowed workers to make changes in support of their rights.

	<TEXT> within his time and culture... Muhammad was actually a wonderful person as were his teachings.... he could give today's liberals a run for their money! He was a "leftist" through-and-through. 

The very same is true of Jesus in the bible. The man was a proto-socialist pacifist who fed the hungry, healed the sick, loved the earth, respected women (even though the bible has painted Mary Magdalene a prostitute and the Vatican has refused to acknowledge gospels which are more flattering), pitied the rich, and preached tolerance and love above all else. 

It's not like the New Testament has changed at all in recent years. It's all there. Yet the evangelical prosperity gospel and perverted supply-side Jesus have taken over American understanding of the religion. Jesus himself would not recognize the version of him that's been created by the religious right. 

Sorry to interject Christianity into a discussion of Islam, but your post struck a nerve with me. </TEXT>
