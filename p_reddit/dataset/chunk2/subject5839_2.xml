	<TEXT> Oh wow. I'll try to check that out. The target combo. Because as I Said, either I just spam every special I have memorized, Or I feel like I'm Button mashing every normal attack on the controller.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank You! Well, the thing, I've been very very interested into "guile" even though I've seen ALOT of people advice against him since he is now top tier and is also very hard to learn the game with.. so basically "ryu" would be optimal for me..

I dont mind playing with ryu to be honest as I have actually memorized his specials already.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright. So I have been a big fan of SF for a very long time but never bothered to pick it up and try it until recentley. Just bought an Ds4 controller to my pc and trying to understand this game..

so my question is : what is more important? the "normal" attacks or the special/unique moves. I have memorized the special attacks of the characters I play but somehow I feel like you need to connect them with the "normal" attacks. But then again, I don't wanna be accused of being a ''BUTTON MASHER''. 

How do you actually know what normal attacks to press to link with the other combos. I dunno if this was a very "vauge" question. </TEXT>
