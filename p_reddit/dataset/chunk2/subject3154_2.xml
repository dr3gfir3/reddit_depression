	<TEXT> I'm really frustrated of high SM PvP so I want to start a new character which has a relatively low Soul Memory. I will backup the save and restore it when the Soul Memory gets too high. So I'd like to know what NG I should stay in and at what SM you get the most PvP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> or "the day I started leveling up". As much as I like the patch overall but some things are a bit extreme. As a former SL 150 player I really liked to use buffs, they gave me a chance to kill all the Havels I meet due to SM matchmaking. I didn't use them all the time, only in certain cases. But now buffs and especially RW and FW got nerfed THAT hard and I'm doing about 250-300 damage with a buffed +10 Weapon against these Havels only to get 3 shot by an unbuffed Katana. At high SM the only thing I can do is to lvl up myself. According to From Software's Beyond-the-Bonfire site the amount of 150 players is so small compared to 200+. At 150 PvP is getting pretty frustrating and I'm planning to go to atleast 200 now...

Edit: I AM squishy at 150. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WTF, the game came out just some days ago and there are already cheaters ruining your multiplayer experience or even worse, your charcter by suiciding with a lot of SM. I hope there will be something like "Watchdog" soon. Atleast I can "Force" them of the edge easier due to the stunlock... Still doesn't resque the gigantic gain of SM. Have fun never co-oping on that char again or getting invaded by Santiers/Havelyns with high Soul Memory...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly my thought. Every post I see is either a post about DSII being better or worse than DS1 because of different reasons, things being OP in PvP and these one liners, like OP mentioned, almost in a facebooky way where there are these "Like if you know these too" posts. Just wait for links being enabled... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing why people get mad is that SM is broken and so mundane stuff gets ridiculously OP with high level. Also people hate not dodgeable dual Avelyns ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh how I waited for this thread... So I was trying to get Summoned as a Mirror Squire when somebody touched the Red Summon Sign. (My build is a buffed Claymore with Great Resonant Soul to punish healers) So I was summoned by a 3 Man gank squad in the King's Passage. It began. Two of them had double Avelyns and the host was spamming lightning spears. But since the enemies were still alive I tried to use that to my advantage and shoot them with GRS. I killed 2 of them. (Both had Ring of Thorns) Then there was only the host, I tried to shoot him too but the Estusjuices were flowing too hard. In the end, where I thought he is finally going to fight me normally, one of his phantoms was summoned again and shot me with his Avelyns. Just Wow. Took out the game, started DS1. Time to do my SL1 run! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right, BUT melee builds had almost no chance of getting through without a bow, an area should not require a specific setup to complete. I still think they nerfed them too hard though... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Thoughts on "Dark Fog"? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-09 20:02:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I was dragonbroing in the Iron Keep and some guy spawncamped me with Dark Fog and the he just waited for me to heal so he could shoot me with Great Resonant Souls. Like, the AoE of Dark Fog is so big and if you try to roll out, they cast another one of their 4+ casts. Really frustrating as a phantom who can't heal up. Also the range on Dark Fog is really big that I haven't yet found a way to avoid it. Do you agree? What are your tricks for dealing with Dark Fog spam? </TEXT>
