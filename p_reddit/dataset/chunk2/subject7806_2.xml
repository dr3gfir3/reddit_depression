	<TEXT> The best way to circumvent a womans primitive and complex SMV radar is showing her that *other* women already want you

You know, some folks tried that on me and ended up ashamed of themselves because I told them to go after these women instead 'cause I didn't give a shit about that. Not with these exact words, of course; I'm rude with guys who try to one-night-stand me through  negging/humble-bragging/PUA related stuff without even noticing. </TEXT>

not married

So...? It's extremely common around here. This country is traditional as fuck and has the biggest Catholic population of the world and yet it's getting extremely rare to have someone telling a guy to marry soon.

Wymeen, on the other hand... they don't exactly tell you to marry soon, *but bloody hell if they don't try to make our greatest life focus be "getting a boyfriend"*. There's even the "annoying aunt" trope here which literally consists of that aunt you see once a year and always asks "what about your boyfriends?/did you get a boyfriend yet?/ you need to get a boyfriend or else you'll end up like [person]" and yadda yadda yadda... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, that's right.

Whenever I see some folks saying society is "on fall" because of traditionalism or something, I just point them to this fact: things are getting bad because we're simply turning into creatures unable to trust each other. Not because of some bullshit like gender roles isn't being "followed". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, I had only two partners on my entire life. 

One wasn't into this subject.

The other was all about having me on the dominant position until he TRPed and went on to say that having me as dominant "emasculated" him.

So yeah, double standard is still a bitch, but it's funny that it's mostly men themselves that create it on both sides: tell women that they want to be oppressed on one, and on another make fun of men and tell 'em to "man up" about that because it's *oh so unnatural to have a man as sub*... and I seriously don't get why they put it that way.

Not saying that there aren't women doing the same, but from what I've seen, most of the time it's guys themselves and it's depressing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fuck is the actual problem with the alt-right?!

Also, considering how the alt right tends to bash on jooz/moosliams but hail the fuck out of Russia for their government+Putin, I'm actually curious how these guys would react to the fact that there's a Russian guy in my family...

... and he's Jewish. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been going through that for quite some time already, and eh, for a good amount of time I thought there was something wrong with me instead of them... and pretty much opressed myself from the inside 'cause I thought, "you aren't acting like you're supposed to, you useless twat"; fortunately, that changed.

Anyway, the only two guys I ever loved turned to that side as well; started off as "beta"s, which I liked a lot because I felt like I could share my life with them and they could share theirs with me, too, and I loved helping them when they needed, but in a small amount of time they turned into "alpha men" and I just felt like running away. Yeah, it often felt like a hard decision because I still liked them, but eh, the moment I noticed I loved the way they were before and it was gone I just ended it. I lost a bunch of male friends as well because of that, too; when I was a kid, I just stayed with the boys 'cause I felt more carefree to do what I liked around them (old "but you're a girl, you're not supposed to do that!" on the other side from colleagues *and* adults), but as we grew, I just slowly got away from them because of that tendency... and it's sad that it's happening. </TEXT>

So no, this is no proof of "gynocentrism" on society, this is simply people trolling around and making others feel awkward regardless of their gender, ya ManBitches. </TEXT>
