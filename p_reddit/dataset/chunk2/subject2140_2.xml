	<TEXT> You know i started out not hating black lives matter protesters. Because after all i think police brutality is a bit out of control.  That said everything they have done since has been embarrassing to see.  Blocking roads, Pushing reporters, faking death threats, Threatening to kill people, interupting politicians at rallys and bullying students in a library who were just trying to study etc.

A real conversation about police brutality in America is sorely needed.  But your hurting the anti police violence movement by acting like this.  Furthermore all this does is hurt race relations on both sides.

"I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word."  Martin Luther King Jr. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not a lawyer. But didn't they rule in Brandenburg v. Ohio that the government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, imminent lawless action.  I feel this guys a scumbag but probably didn't cross the line to the point were he flat out tells people to do it.  On the other hand its not entirely unreasonable for this to be interpreted as inciting violence.
Idk can someone with better knowledge on this shed some light on this?

	<TEXT> I have not watched the video because it appears to have been removed and i am not a lawyer.  But didn't they rule in Brandenburg v. Ohio that the government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, imminent lawless action.  So i guess it depends on what he said.

Idk can someone with better knowledge on this shed some light on this?

EDIT:  I watched a mirror and it appears he does not straight up say anything that would be punishable.  Still hes a fucking scumbag. </TEXT>
