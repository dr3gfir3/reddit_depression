	<TEXT> /u/maizycorn,  
Here's the recipe. For the puree, just peel a guava and chop it up in a processor and sieve out the seeds and lumps.  
 nbsp;  
**Crepes**  
650 g milk, room temperature!  
240 g flour  
90 g sugar  
4 eggs  
50 g butter, melted  
70 g guava puree (you don't need fruit puree, but if you do, add a little less milk)  
 nbsp;  
1. Sift flour into a large bowl.  
2. Add sugar and mix briefly (I use a whisk).    
3. Add in eggs and mix.  
4. Add in milk, slowly at a time. Once about half the milk is added and mixed, add the rest and the guava puree.    
5. Add melted butter and mix fully.  
6. Pour mixture through a sieve. Want runny consistency.  
7. Cling wrap and throw into fridge for at least 30 minutes. Longer is better.  
8. After mixture has become cold, take a pan and on low to medium heat, add a small amount of batter. It takes some trial and error to figure out the right about to cover your pan.  
9. When the edges of the crepe become dry (a minute or so), flip over and cook for a short while longer (1 minute).  
10. Repeat.  
11. To get a consistent size, place a bowl or something circular over the crepe and cut off excess scraps.  
12. Let crepes cool completely before assembling.  
 nbsp;  
**Pastry Cream**    
4 large egg yolks  
37 g cornstarch  
340 g milk  
100 g sugar  
70 g guava (or more, to taste)
225 g heavy cream  
10 g powdered sugar  
 nbsp;  
You need to make a custard and a whipped cream. Take your large bowl and whisk that you're going to make the whipped cream with and throw that into the fridge before you begin. You want it cold.  
1. First prepare **custard component**. In a large bowl, combine egg yolks and cornstarch.  
2. In a saucepan, high heat, combine milk, sugar, and puree. [NOTE, if you're using a different fruit that's acidic, it will curdle so instead fold puree into custard.]  
3. Bring to boil and remove from heat.  
4. While whisking constantly, slowly add to bowl with yolks and cornstarch. You are tempering the egg yolks so that they won't scramble.  
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan on high heat.  
6. Bring to rolling boil, while whisking/ mixing constantly. The mixture will become custard like.  
7. Sieve through a fine mesh into a bowl and cover the bowl with cling wrap. Make sure to press it directly onto the custard to avoid condensation.  
8. Chill.  
9. Now prepare **whipped cream** component.  Take out the chilled bowl, whisk, and cream. 
10. Add cream and powdered sugar and whisk until firm peaks.  
11. Take out guava custard and whisk a bit to loosen it up. Add a small amount of whipped cream to lighten the mixture even more.  
12. Slowly fold in the rest of the whipped cream, making sure not to overfold (will deflate the cream).   
 nbsp;  
**Assembly**  
1. Assemble the cake on whatever you want it to be served on. These cakes are difficult to transfer.   
2. Lay down a crepe and then add some pastry cream. Spread it out to an even amount.  
3. Add another crepe.  Then some more pastry cream.  
4. Repeat.  
5. Every few crepes, use something that's flat to press down onto the cake to help even it out. The edge of the cake will inevitably have less pastry cream than the center.  
6. Once assembled, refrigerate for a few hours (will make it so much easier to cut into).  
7. Top with powdered sugar.  
8. Enjoy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But also, you need to keep trying and pinpoint where exactly the issue is coming from. May be from baking time, stiffness of meringue, ratio of ingredients, or macaronage. Just keep trying and hopefully you'll be able to solve the hollow problem! But yes, when I do French method, I still get hollows sometimes to varying degrees, but basically don't get them if I do Italian. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can definitely try making it without any sponge cake and just layer the ice cream (I'm sure it'd be just as tasty!) The nice thing about this no churn ice cream is that it's thick enough to be piped on as soon as you make it. So you can just pipe each layer, even it out, then move onto the next layer.  
Or maybe you can try using a [gluten free sponge recipe] (http://glutenfreeonashoestring.com/gluten-free-strawberry-cake-roll/). I just googled it, but I'm sure you can find another recipe. I like using roll cake recipes because the sheets bake quickly and are even!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once I started posting on social media, I started making stuff every few days. When you make fattening foods this often, you learn to limit yourself :p. BUT, I definitely ate all the extra batter/ ice cream that didn't make it into the piping bag.  
ALSO, the cake will melt, so I can't bring it across the city to work. Therefore, I have to eat a slice every night with dinner. haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/MiniMobBokoblin, /u/spirallix, /u/PiersonA ,  
For this particular recipe, there are 5 main components: the sponge layers, cranberry puree (used in ice cream and glaze), the ice cream layers, the whipped cream frosting, and the mirror glaze. The recipe seems a bit daunting, but it's pretty fool-proof and tastes great!  
 nbsp;  
The sponge is based off [The Little Eppicurian](http://www.thelittleepicurean.com/2014/03/matcha-green-tea-swiss-roll-strawberry-mousse.html).  
**1. Sponge :** [makes 1 jelly roll sheet]  
112g cake flour  
1 tsp baking powder   
1/4 tsp salt  
5 large eggs, separated  
156 g granulated sugar  
60 g whole milk  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven at 400F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.  
2. Whisk together sifted flour, baking powder, and salt.  
3. In a different, large bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and milk until pale.  
4. Separately, whisk egg whites until medium stiff peaks (if you whisk too stiff, it's harder to incorporate).  
5. Add dry mixture to wet mixture and fold together. Then slowly fold in the medium stiff egg whites.  
6. Pour batter onto the baking sheet and then rap the sheet down a few times to release any big air bubbles.  
7. Bake for 8-9 minutes (a toothpick should go in and out cleanly).  
8. Invert cake, remove silpat or parchment paper, then add a clean silpat/ new parchment paper and revert.  
9. Let cool.  
 nbsp;  
The ice cream is a no-churn variety from [Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/no-churn-vanilla-ice-cream.html)  
**2. Cranberry Puree:**  
450 g cranberries  
240 ml water  
 nbsp;  
1. Add cranberries and water in a pot and heat on high.  
2. Let cranberries pop and when they look soft, mash up the cranberries until you get an apple sauce like consistency. If it's too liquidy, keep mixing over high heat until it reduces.  
3. Pass through a fine mesh strainer and cool.  
 nbsp;  
**3. No Churn Ice cream:**  
396 g (14 oz can) condensed milk  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
pinch of salt  
470 g heavy whipping cream  
75 g cranberry puree
 nbsp;  
1. Whip the whipping cream to stiff peaks.  
2. Whisk in the condensed milk.  
**--** Vanilla base complete.  
3. If adding in flavors (in this case, cranberry), fold in about 75g cranberry puree). [I did it to taste.]  
 nbsp;  
**Cake Assembly:**  
1. Line a cake pan with parchment paper.  
2. Lay down a piece of cake.  
3. Add ice cream bases to piping bags and pipe onto the cake layer you put down.  
4. Add another piece of cake.   5. Continue layering until you reach the top of your cake pan.  
6. Freeze for at least 6 hours.  
 nbsp;  
**4. Whipped Cream Frosting:**  
235 g heavy whipping cream  
30 g powdered sugar (give or take, to taste depending on how sweet you want it)  
2 g gelatin  
10-15 ml water  
 nbsp;  
1. Add water to gelatin and mix until apple sauce consistency.  
2. Heat for about 30 seconds until liquid.  
3. Whisk whipping cream and slowly add in liquid gelatin. Whisk until stiff peaks.  
 nbsp;  
This glaze was adapted from [RosannaPansino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZhV63pkDBw). Skipping out on the condensed milk makes it very sticky (I've made this mistake before), so don't do that.   
**5. Cranberry Mirror Glaze:**  
55 g white chocolate (chopped up finely to help melting)  
35 g condensed milk  
50 g sugar  
61.25 g corn syrup  
25 ml water  
4 g gelatin (+ about 15 ml water to bloom)  
60ish g cranberry puree  
 nbsp;  
1. Mix gelatin in water until you get an apple sauce consistency. 
2. In a small pot add corn syrup, water, and sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Add in gelatin and condensed milk. Whisk until gelatin fully dissolved.  
4. In a bowl with the chocolate, add the liquid mixture and whisk until chocolate is fully melted.  
5. Add cranberry puree (I added about 60g, but was doing it to taste [to overpower the white chocolate flavor].  
6. Bring the glaze to room temperature or slightly colder. (You can cover it with cling wrap and throw it in the fridge, but be careful. You don't want it to solidify, but don't want to melt the whipped cream frosting either.)  
 nbsp;  
**Decoration:**  
1. Pull out the ice cream cake (should be easy if you lined out the cake pan with parchment paper) and place on cake board [I just use cardboard wrapped with foil] or plate.  
2. Start to cover the cake with a small amount of whipped cream frosting to serve as a "crumb" coat. Freeze for a few minutes.  
3. Add the rest of the whipped cream frosting.  
4. Freeze for 10ish minutes.  
5. Add glaze to a piping bag and make drips around the edge of the cake.   
6. Fill in the rest of the top.  
7. Decorate however else you like. I used [macarons and cranberries](http://bit.ly/2gIf2Hg).  
8. Freeze until ready to serve and enjoy! :D   </TEXT>
