	<TEXT> Here's the format you should follow:

* System - Xbone

* System username - Kuwait Grips

* Preferred CoD - Only one I have for Bone is BO3

* Location - New York

* Availability - Depends on my work schedule, I'm on a J12 swing shift but I'm usually down to play for about an hour or so a day after work. On my days off I play about 3 sessions that are around two hours each

* Ability - I'm BO3 is the first CoD I've played since BO1 so I'm a bit rusty, even if I play liek shut I have fun

* Preferred modes - TDM and Domination, I don't really like zombies that much. 

* Microphone (Y/N) - Yes

* Age (or preferred age) - I'm 19. Don't really care how old you are honesty. I just need more people to play with

	<TEXT> AFC West would be dope IMO. 

QB: Rivers or Carr, I can't really decide, the Raiders are my second team but I'm hesitant to put Carr over Rivers just due to experience and the fact that I'm not sure what kind of year Rivers is having. I'd put Manning if he didn't decline so sharply this year. 

HB: Charles and CJ Anderson

WR: Cooper, DT, Sanders, Maclin

TE: Davis, Kelce, Gates

OL: Whoever would make up the best I guess, the only o lineman I know off the top of my head is Mathis

Then you'd have a combination of the Broncos and Chiefs front 7 along with Talib, Harris, and Sean Smith at CB and Ward, Berry and Nosdoom as the safeties. 

NFC East wouldn't be too bad I guess. 

QB: Romo, but Eli is playing pretty well too. 

HB: Murray/Morris/Sproles/Mathews

WR: Dez, Garon, OBJ, Desean Jackson, Cruz

TE: Witten, Ertz

OL: I could be a homer and just say the Dallas Oline but I think that the other teams have pretty good guys on their lines too. I think the line would definitely have Zach Martin and maybe Tyron and Frederick. (Again, don't want to be a homer) 

As far as defense goes I don't really know many defensive players on the rest of the teams. Fletcher Cox would definitely make it. Along with Maxwell, Prince and DRC. The NFC East team would be interesting to say the least. We could have Romo play the regular season and then Eli play throughout the playoffs lol. 

I'd like to see what other NFC East fans would choose for the defense, I think the offense is straightforward for the most part, but I'm not sure about the defense.  </TEXT>

When college is in session:

Easiest- MDMA, Oxy and Xanax
Hardest- Honestly, weed is hard to find. Same with LSD and Shrooms. 

When college is not in session (basically summer):
Easiest- MDMA, Weed and Shrooms
Hardest- LSD

MDMA is the only thing I can find whenever I need it. I can NEVER find LSD. And the college kids dry out the town of weed when they're here, same with shrooms.  </TEXT>

Kuechly 
Jeffery
Harrison Smith
Bobby Wagner
Stephon Gilmore
Lavonte David

Hindsight is 20/20 I guess, but like you said he's playing a lot better now.

	<TEXT> Pretty sure everyone hates the Cowboys. I don't want to judge one team so I'll do all of them. 

Patriots - I love Brady, BB is an all time great, Edelman is the EdelMAN and Gronk is amazing. Patriots are cool in my book. 

Jets - I have a soft spot for the Jets. I want them to do well. They have great uniforms and loyal fans. 

Bills - Fuck 'em. I live in Central New York and half of my family is made up of Bills fans. They're insufferable. 

Dolphins - Meh. 

Colts - They're decent. Luck is cool I guess. 

Texans - Watt is phenomanal. Wish they didn't fall off so soon. Looking forward to them getting good again. 

Titans - McNair is one of my all time favorites. Mariota looks promising. They're alright. 

Jaguars - I have a soft spot for them. My early memories of Madden are playing as them when they had Marcus Stroud, Leftwich and Taylor/Jones-Drew. I hope they get to the top of the AFC with Bortles soon. 

Steelers - I like Big Ben. Harrison is one of my favorite defensive players ever. The Bus is great too, was really happy to see him get in the Hall. I don't care what anyone says he deserves it. 

Bengals - My optometrist is a Bengals fan, so I see them in a good light. 

Ravens - Fuck yeah. That's all. 

Browns - I want them to do well. 

Chiefs - Another soft spot team. I loved Holmes, and Derrick Thomas is an all time great. Sucks about Charles. Most electrifying player in the game imo. Hope he gets better and kicks ass next year!

Raiders - If I wasn't already a Dallas fan I'd be a Raiders fan. The only jersey I have that isn't a Cowboys jersey is a Raiders Woodson jersey. Love them 3

Broncos - Fuck 'em. 

Saints - Meh. I like Brees. 

Falcons - Fuck 'em. My cousin is a Falcons fan and he's a prick when it comes to football, I used to like them but he ruined it for me. 

Buccaneers - Decent. 

Panthers - I love Cam. 

Seahawks - Meh. 

49ers - Meh. 

Rams - Meh. 

Cardinals - Like them a lot. Love Fitzy and Palmer. 

Bears - The Bears and the Cubs Chicago sports team I don't mind. Fuck the Bulls/WSox/Blackhawks though. 

Packers - Like them. Favre is magical and Rodgers is the best QB in the league. Nothing negative about them really. 

Lions - Fuck 'em. I understand the call against last postseason was awful but I received threats and that's not cool.

Vikings - I like them. 

Giants - My grandfather is a Giants fan so I can't hate them too much. They're fun to watch and DALvNYG are my favorite divisional games to watch. 

Redskins - Eh. 

Eagles - Fuck 'em.

	<TEXT> I was actually just talking to my friend about this. The way penalties are programmed into this game are asinine. Basically, the computer only recognizes and calls penalties if it "meant" for the penalties to happen or if a player triggers them. So if it's a computer running into your receiver but there isn't a specific animation there won't be a call. But say you were playing a CB and pressed the button to tackle prematurely, it'll "trigger" the animation and the penalty will be called. It's the same way with challenges. Almost all of the questionable calls in the game are calls the computer makes on purpose. It'll purposefully call a receiver out of bounds on an obvious catch or call him in bounds on an obvious no catch to see if the player will challenge it. It's pretty stupid. There might be someone else that can explain it better but that's my take on it. It blows.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Self explanatory. Your favorite character vs the fallout games with some stipulations. 

Fallout 3 - Your character starts the game captured by super mutants and has to escape. He or she has the choice to support the Brotherhood or the Enclave. Who do think they'd support and how would they do? If you think they would stay rogue would they succeed in taking over the Capital Wasteland? 

Fallout New Vegas - Your character arrives in the Mojave Outpost and wishes to go to New Vegas. If he or she makes it they are encountered by House, Benny, Caesars ambassador and the NCR ambassador. Who do they join and do they succeed in the battle of Hoover Dam?

DLC is optional for both games.  </TEXT>

For Fallout 3 I would choose Harkness. I think it'd be cool if he would join me after I figured out his past. In lore it probably wouldn't work since he's the head of security but I think it'd be really fun. 

So yeah, who would you have as a companion of you could? And it can be any game, I chose 3 and NV because those are the only two I have enough knowledge about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope I don't get judged for this. But I've been playing WWE 2k15 Universe Mode and I'm having a blast. It's the first WWE game I've played since Smackdown vs RAW 2007. 

Basically, Universe mode puts you in the driver seat. You control every aspect of the WWE product. You can create tag teams, different shows, customize which belts wrestlers fight for and can create rivalries that you can play. It's everything I've ever wanted in a WWE game. 

You want Hulk Hogan and the Rock to form a tag team and fight Undertaker and Kane in a steel cage? You can do it. 

You want John Cena to become a bad guy and join the Authority with Randy Orton? Interrupting matches for up and coming stars and taking them out before they can fight? You can do it. 

Those are only two possible storylines, and they're almost endless. You can pick from templates or create them manually and it's just so fun. I actually spent last night creating rivalries for the Royal Rumble and watched the AI duke it out. 

So yeah, I've honestly felt like a kid again this game made me a WWE fan again and I couldn't tell you how excited I was to watch RAW this week and see my childhood hero again for the first time in years (Kane). I don't remember why I stopped watching WWE so many years ago but it's all better now because I'm back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before I start I'm letting you know that I'm enjoying the beta a lot. 

The main differences I've drawn up are really just how casual (for lack of a better term, I hate using this word) they made it. To me it seems like it has the depth of a free to play game. Regenerating ammo and grenades, only one blaster, regenerating health, long TTK and no voice chat in game are the negatives. I can look past the lack of classes and the power up tokens and stuff like that because the new system (while not as great) still works pretty well and I kind of enjoy it. The spawns are a bit wonky at times though. 

That's not to say I don't miss classes, playing with friends and having to talk and decide who is gonna be what class and which command posts we're gonna go after was one of my favorite things. Rolling up as a squad of droideka while we have a sniper cover us from long distance and other tactical stuff like that. It just seems that the only gunplay is with the basic blaster and to me that leaves more to be desired. 

However, despite all that I'm having fun, and this is only the beta so my opinion doesn't reflect the whole game. 

EDIT: By one blaster I mean you don't get a secondary, I know there are multiple blasters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a quick question. Is default weapon/gadgets for Corvo just the stuff he starts with? If so that's a bit of a disadvantage, but not too much. That only leaves him with a flintlock pistol, his crossbow, sword and level one blink. While the spy would have stock weapons: his revolver, knife, cloak and disguise (the Sapper is moot imo). 

Round 1 - I give to Corvo 8/10. I doubt the spy would be able to get behind Corvo without him knowing. And the spys attack speed with the knife is slower than Corvos with his sword so mindlessly stabbing hoping for a backstab wouldn't work. Corvo can take multiple slashes with a sword in his armor so I don't think a knife would do much (unless it was a backstab). The revolver is the difference maker, but even then Corvo can blink-instant kill between shots. I just don't think the spy is quick enough to react. The only chance I give to the spy is if he can cloak and manage to sneak up on Corvo, that's a big IF though. Corvo was the personal bodyguard of the Empress and I assume that means he's trained to be good at defending against surprise attacks. The spy could also disguise as one of Corvos allies, or as Emily or even the Empress to throw him off, that could probably work. But I still give the edge to Corvo. 

Round 2 - Corvo 10/10. The element of surprise is all that the spy has. If Corvo is expecting him to disguise as an ally or cloak then that element is completely wiped away. I don't see the spy taking this round at all but I'm definitely open to discuss it. 

Round 3 - This one is a bit tricky. If by better you mean smoothly? I'd give it to the spy. It'd be a simple stab in the back. But if there is a lot of opposition I'd give it to Corvo. I'd honestly say they're even here but I really don't know what you mean by "better." 

Bonus: This round is closer but I give it to Corvo 6/10. If the spy is fast enough to dead ringer and backstab Corvo he takes it, but if Corvo "kills" him and then immediately blinks away or gets further than the spy can reach (I'm only assuming this because in my opinion it would make sense for a wanted man to immediately flee the scene of a murder) and his cloak dissapates which Corvo can then react to I think Corvo takes it. 

I think one on one Corvo takes it, the spy isn't really built for that. He's built for the element of surprise and that seems like something Corvo is prepared for (if you ignore the beginning scene, considering there was literally nothing he could do since he was suspended in mid air). But I feel if you put the spy in Corvos shoes for Dishonored he would kick ass. The Sapper would be perfect for the arc pylons, watch towers and walls of light and the cloak is better than anything Corvo has in his Arsenal. The six shot revolver would also be immensely helpful because the max that Corvos goes up to is 4 iirc. Could post though. Dishonored is one of my favorite games and I also adore TF2.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> QB - Brady/Manning easily. I think Brees gets in eventually. 
HB - Definitely not a first ballot lock right now but I don't see a reason why AP wouldn't get in. 
FB - I don't think there have been any dominant fullbacks since Lorenzo Neal. 
WR - Reggie Wayne, hopefully Steve Smith. Possibly Andre Johnson, Fitz. Boldin maybe? Idk. There's a log jam but I'm just rattling off names. Megatron definitely gets in. 
TE - Gates and Witten are locks without a doubt. Gronk is in if he keeps up this level of play and stays healthy (fingers crossed) 
OL - Thomas definitely. Can't think of others of the top of my head. Peters? 
DL - Jared Allen should get in, I'd love Wilfork to get in but the Voters don't like nose tackles. Watt probably gets in (same rules as Gronk though, keep up level of play and stay healthy) 
LB - Ware is a lock, Peppers should also get in. 
DB - I consider Revis a lock, his twilight years will definitely influence the decision though. Woodson is a lock. 
K - Not sure, if any one currently gets in it should be Vinatieri. Leading scorer for two franchises and won Super Bowls with his leg.
P - I don't see one getting in, Ray Guy just got in and he revolutionized the whole position. 

To me the Hall of Fame is made up of players that either A) you can't tell the story of the NFL without and/or B) have the stats and accolades that prove they are one of the best to ever play their position. People may be mad that I have AP but his story of tearing his ACL and then coming back to rush for over 2000 yards and win MVP is like something out of a movie. The same rule applies to Vinatieri with his clutch playoff kicks, the history of not only the Patriots but the NFL would be completely different if it weren't for him.  </TEXT>

If he isn't doing that, he's usually talking to the same people the entire night. I'm usually one of the last ones to pass out, bring alcohol and cigarettes for more than just myself, and usually have everybody laughing. 

If my dad and I were going after the same girl? Hmm. If we met her that night, my dad takes it. If I knew her previously I take it.  </TEXT>

Factor in the fact that they're bloodlusted and boom. A few hundred pigeons in each eye, once the eyes are pecked out they probably have a few dozen or so that can stay in his eye sockets and keep pecking. There could be a few go in his ears and a bunch of others to distract him. I honestly give it to the pigeons 7/10 times, maybe more. Think about it like one human versus 1000 bloodlusted horseflies, it's winnable but it'd be a test of endurance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simple, your favorite character has to go through the Resident Evil series, there will be three different situations:

The first one, normal. Your character simply replaces the playable character of the game and gets their standard gear. 

The second one, your favorite character replaces the playable character of the game but only gets the gear that the PC would get. 

The third one, your favorite character replaces the PC and gets their standard gear BUT the main antagonist is replaced by your second favorite character. 

Round 1: Resident Evil 1. Your character replaces either Chris or Jill (you can pick) and must finish the story. 

Round 2: Resident Evil 2. Your character replaces Leon and must finish the story. 

Round 3: Resident Evil 3. Your character replaces Jill and rather than Jill getting sick at the clock tower (or whenever it happens, my memory fails me) it happens to Carlos, can your character save him and escape Raccoon City?

Round 4: Resident Evil 4. Your character replaces Leon and must rescue Ashley and kill Saddler. 

Round 5: Resident Evil 5. Your character replaces Chris BUT he/she does not get Sheva Alomar, can they destroy the Uroboros virus and kill Wesker? (Boulder punching required) 

BONUS Your favorite character replaces the antagonist of all the games above, can the resident evil characters survive?

	<TITLE> Hi /r/squaredcircle, I'm trying to get back into watching WWE after not watching it the past few years, is there anyone that can give me a summary of what I've missed? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-22 10:04:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Title is the main point, and if I should post this somewhere else please let me know but I read the sidebar and since this is related to wrestling I figured it would be okay. 

Basically, I watched wrestling religiously when I was younger. HBK and Edge were my heroes, but once they retired I stopped really keeping up with it. Really the only thing I know is that Lesnar broke the streak. I watched Night Of Champions the other night, it was the first event I've watched in full since Mania 26. I missed RAW last night and plan to watch it today, I want to get back into WWE but I have a few questions to ask:

Who is Seth Rollins? Is he the newest big name in WWE? 

What's up with those dudes with the trombone? 

Are there any wrestlers that were popular back in 2010 that have since retired? If so, who? 

Who are some of the up and coming stars I should be looking out for? 

And the last one, what feuds/rivalries have surfaced the past few years that I should know about? 

This might seem like a troll post but it really isn't, and I know I could have googled this stuff but I was hoping to get the questions answered here by fans, and maybe have a little discussion as well. 

Anyway that's it, and mods if this type of post isn't allowed let me know please. Thanks everyone! 

And sorry if the formatting is bad, typed this up on my phone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to see something along the lines of Spec Ops: The Line but with horror. For those that haven't played, SO:TL was a third person shooter that was heavily praised for its intense story. Throughout all of the traumatic events that happen, the main characters go from your run of the mill soldiers to shellshocked killers due to the post traumatic stress. I'd like to see a horror game do something like that, wherein the game starts out as a simple horror game but as it goes on and your character gets exposed to more horror he/she goes more and more insane. Sort of like the sanity meter in Eternal Darkness or Amnesia without the ability to gain sanity back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm assuming you're talking about current players and not targeted because as /u/DaZerg said the drafts are random now. I may be a homer but when I start a non-Dallas franchise I always trade a few picks to the Cowboys (usually a second and two thirds) for Demarcus Lawrence and Randy Gregory. Gregory has really good development (went from 79 - 89 in one season) and Lawrence has decent block shedding and good power moves (88 IIRC) I also got Lawrence to go from a 77 - 91 after two seasons. As far as offensive players go Jimmy Garappolo (QB for the Pats) has a decent arm. With running backs you can't go wrong with Turbin or Michael (Seattle) Joseph Randle (Dallas) or Carlos Hyde (49ers). I can't think of any wide receivers right now but I'll update it when I do. Gavin Escobar (Dallas) is a decent receiver though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sephiroth will replace Thor and be the flying/magical heavy hitter. 

I would probably have Commander Shepard replace Captain America and be the leader. 

Assuming he wouldn't infect anybody, Alex Mercer from Prototype can be the tank/bruiser replacement for the Hulk. 

I'd have Solid Snake replace Black Widow. 

Corvo Attono can replace Hawkeye. 

And then I'd have Raiden from MGS replace Iron Man. 

I want to see this happen.
