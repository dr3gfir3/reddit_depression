	<TEXT> Our faction uses Kik. I have both Kik and Line (and probably every other messenger app out there lol) and I find both convenient to use. Kik can also do those things mentioned by the others that Line does, except Line has the cool stickers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm very much looking forward to war. We're booting four people today I think. So much inactivity and we've been carrying their big butts for a long time now it's not fair. I hope we can gather up new recruits for war. It's my favorite part of the game!

I don't exactly know how to describe a region. lol. I'm not always on global chat but when I am I see the same people again and again. There are random people with nothing to do from time to time. Just yesterday someone cursed at me out of nowhere for talking to someone else. lol He was a new player, so yeah there are those. There's the occasional drama too: factions disbanding, members getting kicked out, arguments on global, you name it. How is it in Crawford?

	<TEXT> Way back faction lock during tourneys was put in place we weren't able to switch members around because the alliance was pretty new then. Now that it's been a while, we can't do much with it. Pretty ironic. Haha. It's all up to the leaders now I guess. Whatever happens I know my faction leader will choose what's best.

And darn, I was kinda hoping for a bit there that I was in the same region. lol. I play in Hart region. I think we still get some new players every now and then but the top factions are already too strong and heavy it's like they're competing amongst themselves. Haha. As always, thanks again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! I enjoyed reading everything so thank you again for taking the time to share these things! I know a lot of members won't be happy if they get cut off and that's the main concern of our leader as well. We have a lower rank in terms of rep than our ally faction, but seem to be more active and organized and score better in events than them. Initially it was going to be a 20(from us)-10(from them) division but I guess after the two leaders considered how other members would react, they decided against it. I personally would like to see a merge though, because we could definitely use their strong players but then it's not my call. I'm way too invested in the game for my own good. Lol.

What region do you play in? Again, very much appreciate your help! </TEXT>

I've also tried checking the raid leaderboards to recruit but to my luck most of the people without factions there are inactive. Thank you again and I hope your faction continues to do well! :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great tips. I belong to a faction that has our own kik group (extremely helpful in filling up those 8 slots in wars). Not all of us are a part of it yet but a good majority of the most active members are. I'm curious though, would you know and care to share how your co-lead was able to recruit a lot of those members? I'm trying to do the same myself but haven't gotten the results I want. Any tips? :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Those are definitely on top of my list! I've been seeing them around too and been wanting to try making one.
2. I love salted caramel. Somewhere in my menu I'll definitely include salted caramel!
3. I actually found a recipe for a ricotta lemon souffle just now while looking around. Looks pretty good!
4. Haven't really thought about adding herbs and spices, but fruit seems like a good way to balance flavors.
5. That does sound appetizing. I love mille-feuille myself and I'll definitely look around for a good recipe.

Thanks for the brilliant ideas! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe some of the criteria are technique and level of difficulty. #4 is something like this: http://www.cocoablack.com/sites/default/files/WCM%20blog%20photos/Ruth%20Hinks%20Moulded%20Pralines%20at%20World%20Chocolate%20Masters.JPG
where I use a polycarbonate mold and fill the center with a certain flavor. #5 is something like a croissant or a danish, where the pastry is flaky. One of my options is actually a creme brulee but I feel like it'll be too simple and was hoping to add something more to it if I do decide to go with it. </TEXT>

My factionmates except for one are all in the US (I'm in Asia) and I wake up as early as 5am on war weekends just to get to play with them and I don't really mind because I get soooo pumped up (even though we never get to place high). I guess the worst thing I've experienced so far was having to wait for more than an hour just to get 8 people to sign on. Totally sucks because that hour could've been spent being in the actual war. Less points for us. :(  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it's not because you're the highest level person in your faction. The highest leveled member in ours gets the highest scores all the time. I think it's because of the refills he gets (he gets an awful lot compared to me, who rarely gets them), but I'm not sure if that's all there is to it. Sometimes the opposing faction gets to an unbelievably high score that we think they're coining it, but we're not totally sure.

Oh, and when you use enough refills and win your battles all the time, you get these bonuses for your winning streak, so those are score boosters too.

Someone who scores very high should let us know! :P </TEXT>
