	<TEXT> It's not just Qatar which seems to let off Qataris, there was also the case of a pedophile Qatari prince Hamid Bin Abdul Sa ni al Thani who had sex with 16 Czech minors, two of whom were under 11 according to other reports, but as usual, he was untouchable and repatriated back to Qatar http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/czechs...0_pozice_48137
Also there are far more extreme cases where Qataris are let off scot-free; a Qatari man raped a British teacher, stabbed her in the heart and then burnt her corpse in the desert, and the man who aided the rapist only got 3 years, and even worse the Qatari courts overturned the Qatari rapist-murderers punishment after the initial press outrage died down. He's now facing a retrial, while the victims mother barely has enough money to cover the legal costs and had to crowdfund it.
And even worse is how they treat the domestic servants. Hate to bring in nationality but in Qatar, nationality is everything. On top are Qataris, then GCC national, then professional white / arab expats, then a huge gap and all the African and Asian slaves at the bottom (88% of the country!). The only reason these cases are covered are because the victim is white. The millions of housemaids in the Gulf states are treated much worse and receive no justice whatsoever.
For instance; was the "Al Dhaid" murder case in the UAE, where 4 Emirati men kidnapped an Ethiopian maid, gang-raped her twice in different locations, then ran her over with a car and then proceeded to stone her to death with large rocks which smashed her skull into pieces.
After paying 200k dirhams ($50k) "blood money" in total (so around $12.5k each, a few months salary for an Emirati), they were released from prison. One of the attackers 13 years prior had raped and murdered a Pakistani little girl, but her father who was an imam forgave him.
So just to be clear, 4 Emirati men, one of whom was already a known rapist and murderer, gang raped and then brutally murdered an Ethiopian housemaid, smashing her skull into pieces, and they were released after paying just over $10k each. Because the Ethiopian family were practically forced into accepting the blood money, none of them received their sentence.
This was the "Al Dhaid murder", I strongly insist people look it up because it's even worse than you think. Here's one link to the story, but only a partial coverage: http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/courts/...oney-1.1410497
Now, how many people heard about this? Not one international news media covered this case. Not one! It happened when I was an expat in the Gulf, and no international news gave a **** about it. In any case I'm never going back to these countries again even if they quadruple my salary.
Ultimately, in the GCC countries, if a woman gets raped it's her fault. Many Westerners do not realize how fundamentally different their values are and why they believe it is the woman's fault. Even many policemen, judges and courts, when punishing a raped woman, state that the victim "seduced" or "lured" them and thus deserve their punishment. This is what Westerners fundamentally do not understand about the niqab / abaya that Gulf women wear; they think it's about "modesty" or "culture" because they are viewing it from the Western point of view. Wrong; the reason they wear it is simple; because if they didn't, anything that would happen to them would be their fault and their tribe or community would blame them rather than the attacker. The abaya is not for "modesty", it is to stop themselves getting raped.


EDIT:
Another very recent story which deserves to be told so I'll add it in here, since it was barely covered in the media. In case anyone still believes that it's just random primitive criminals engaging in this behavior, the highest levels of Gulf Arab governments engage in this too e.g. the repeated mass gang-rape of two women by over 20 Saudi diplomats http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/i...w/48940210.cms http://www.reuters.com/article/india...0RH2A820150917
Basically, a Saudi diplomat, called Majed Hassan Ashoor, who lives in Jeddah, enslaved 2 Nepali housmaids when posted as a diplomat in India and along with over 22 of his Saudi diplomat friends (with diplomatic immunity), they raped, gang-raped, sodomized and sexually tortured 2 Nepali maids every day for over 4 months, ending September 2015. The maids said that sometimes, 7-8 Saudi diplomats raped them at the same, they anally raped them and they even tortured the maids for their own sexual gratification and they had injuries all over their body. Mr Majed Hassan Ashoor passed the maids around to over 20 of his friends who repeatedly gang-raped them. If you think that's bad enough, all of this happened with the consent of his wife and his daughter, Roza Ashoor, who knew what was going on. The wife of the Saudi diplomat also tortured and beat the maids, forced them to work 20 hour days and starved them and forced them to feed off scraps. Basically this enormous gang-rape racket happened with the consent of his family. The only reason this was found out was because Mr Ashoor tried to enslave a third maid, who managed to escape and notified the Indian police. When the Saudi diplomat was exposed, the Saudi embassy spent the next few days berating the indian police for violating diplomatic immunity. The diplomat seemed to think he did nothing wrong since he "bought" the Nepali maids (thinking they were slaves) and that he could do anything thanks to his diplomatic immunity, and that the police were at fault for daring to rescue the slaves. These 2 Nepali maids went abroad to find work after their homes and livelihoods were destroyed by the Nepali earthquake and then their lives were destroyed by the gang of Saudis. This gang of Saudi diplomats will never be punished and Mr Majed Hassan Ashoor, is living freely in Jeddah today and will never be punished for his heinous crimes. In fact, you can guarantee that back home, he has simply got two new maids and is just repeating the same thing in Saudi Arabia, except now nothing can be done. </TEXT>
