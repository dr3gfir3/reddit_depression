	<TEXT> Seeing a therapist would be very difficult as far as cultural aspects and my parents not really seeing mental illnesses past the stray jacket stereotype. Do you think meditation could help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome! I think gradual changes is a big missing key for me. I think I am a bit impatient with this which makes it a lot harder. Do you think meditation could help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright so I had this long thing typed out but I realized it wasn't capturing the main point haha so here is the main point. I want to eat healthy but I always cave. I will go 5 days eating really amazing good foods then go 7 days eating absolutely terrible (like a whole box of brownies and whole pizza to myself in a night type of thing). Of course I always feel so terrible about myself when I eat bad and I feel so amazing and confident when I eat good. I want to stop doing this up/down thing. I need to find a way to control myself. It feels like I need to be chewing like I need to be eating even if I am so close to puking because of how much I have eaten. No matter what I still have the urge to eat. I need help controlling myself and I need help staying on a consistent diet. Please guys any advice helps, it's starting to really impact my mental health and I'm getting somewhere I've never been before. That's why I decided I can't do this alone anymore, I need help! </TEXT>
