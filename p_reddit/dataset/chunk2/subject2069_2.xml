	<TEXT> I'm a heterosexual male (and I'm white, the tumblr hated trifecta!) so this has never been an issue for me, but before joining Reddit I didn't really know it was an issue for anyone.

However, after trawling through /creepyPMs I've realised that this is a pretty prolific problem.  To that end, I'm generally pretty curious as to what goes through a guy's mind to decide to do this, and to understand if the sexual gratification comes from the sending of the pic, or the hopes of receiving something in return?

Furthermore, is this a one way issue? If guys suddenly became inundated with pictures of girls tits would they care? Is this why it's perhaps difficult for some males to understand the intrusiveness of what they're doing?

TL:DR - I'm just curious why people send unsolicited pics of their junk to other people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to say I agree.  That's not to say that it is literally a perfect series, but I can safely say it's probably as close to what I consider perfect as I'll ever read in my lifetime.

For me it's the depth that does it.  I love the theories, and for there to be enough scope for people to have hundreds of theories, there needs to be  hundreds of fleshed-out characters, motivations, hints scattered throughout, etc.  And this is a thing GRRM is great at.

I love that I've not read the series in months, but I'm still thinking about it, wondering.   </TEXT>

But a HUE white only bulb and hue tap. You permanently leave the power on but can turn it in and off from your smartphone. That way the fan would stay on and the light could either be on or off independently. 

Not your cheapest solution, but workable. Also, you may like hue bulbs and end up getting more or coloured ones.

I bought a few for my bedroom to sort a shite job by previous owner and now I have them in every room. Plus white light makes rooms look bigger and airier than yellow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, it's also the same argument some people with valid points occasionally make.

Given that Pokemon is currently still massively relevant, it's pretty well timed - and maybe both parents play and enjoy it.

This is like someone pulling you up if they overhear you quoting a movie you like or singing lyrics to a song you like but they don't.   </TEXT>

Although, the teal ones were there first, and the lilac ones are always taking their jobs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who has invested in real estate and whose property has increased in value I wholeheartedly disagree with you.

Also, you're speaking about the housing market requiring some foresight of the future, yet you're advising him to put his money in the stock market? That's ludicrous.  You also said earlier that a 19 y/o would have no knowledge of buying property or of house maintenance, yet you're advising he invests.

The bottom line is OP will always need a place to live, it's what the majority of the population goes to work to be able to afford. If he gets a gaff now then he's in the enviable position that all he needs to do for the rest of his life is get a job he enjoys and pays enough to cover his recurring bills.

I fundamentally disagree with your logic, and you with mine. Continuing this debate will be fruitless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use ableton but I imagine it's the same for most DAWs - I think launch pads are optimised for ableton but there will be others.

Essentially you can set each part of your track to a different button on the midi controller and then when you press them it triggers the corresponding sample/clip. It's like having loads of different play buttons. And if you get one with knobs / sliders then you can start midi mapping things like volume, eq etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What software do you use? What kind of laptop do you have?! You could get something like a launchpad or other midi controller then just assign parts of your tracks to different buttons so you're launching them sequentially so you're not just faking. If you have any envelopes mapped you could set them to knobs or sliders and do that live also, etc? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree - in the day and age of YouTube nobody has an excuse to not be able to maintain minor house problems. And as long as the city isn't in decline, real estate is money in the bank. Plus the money he's saving on (for example) $1000 a month rent is more than any stocks would give on a monthly basis.  

At university I owned a car and I rented, the combined expense of those was huge. Then I graduated, had to pay rent for like 5 more years until I saved for a deposit for a house. If I'd have gotten on the properly ladder in first year university I'd have easily saved ~ 50k in rent. 

And the things I'm advising may not be essential now, but they are in the long run, and provided the market doesn't crashC a house is an investment in itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not necessarily - my degree, for example, was very specific to work in one city.

Plus, I'm advocating getting on the property ladder whilst he has a lot of liquid cash, it means he won't be paying rent for his whole college career (provided he's not currently at home), plus if he is he could rent the house out for income, or live in it and sell it and purchase a new one should he choose to move house down the line.

At university I had a car and it was pretty much a necessity for where I lived. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never had any debt at all until I was 26. I lived by your dads rule and it always served me well. All my friends racked up thousands and thousands on student loans (that they didn't need, it was just for a better student experience) and they're still paying them now.

However, the only reason I have debt now is because I went to apply for a mortgage and physically couldn't as I was a ghost in the eyes of banks. So I bought a motorbike (I could afford in cash) on credit just to build up a credit score and now I have a mortgage.

My advice would be don't buy things you can't afford, but even when you can, use a credit card and repay it instantly just so you build a consistent credit score.

Edit: fixed typo.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My advice would be live life as if you had not won the money EXCEPT:

1. Buy a nice house that's about 200/300k (it'll do you for life)
2. Buy a good second hand car (new is a waste as you lose so much cash instantly)
3. Keep like 100k for years and years worth of bills.

If you do the above it means you can live life like the rest of us except never having to worry about having a roof over your head or bills needing paid.  

Also, definitely stick it out at uni, 750k won't last forever.  </TEXT>
