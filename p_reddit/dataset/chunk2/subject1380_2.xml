	<TEXT> any examples on what i could list? i don't know what to include that wouldn't come off as me copy pasting something that i found off a "how to create your first resume!" site and that would also relate to the kind of job i'm looking for. i could include proficiency with Windows computers and Office applications but i feel like that would be implied in a programming job. "strong critical thinking skills", "highly analytical", "creative thinker" would probably fall under the cliches but if you think it'd help, i'll include them!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found all of them on Amazon! Ripple Junction is the main manufacturer, except for the Scott Pilgrim one which is why I'm slightly concerned about it quality wise.
Here are the links:
