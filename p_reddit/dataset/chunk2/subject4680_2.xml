	<TEXT> Well, in the first ever encounter we played, my players accidentally burned down the old tower they were in, and watched it burn as their short rest. From that point on, they have become kind of a fire team, and burned up almost all of their enemies, and on occasion each other. Also, turning enemies shields into fun-house mirrors in order to stun their... Dumber enemies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard multiple say they want the removal of the karma system, because "it makes them feel guilty about their actions, which shouldn't happen in a video game." Am I the only one that things the consequences of your actions, and how the game plays out based on your decisions is actually something good? Am I the only one that savors the feeling that I screwed up, and honestly have fun living the consequences of my actions, or am I just playing this game wrong? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I have two stories from my school, although I guess they weren't just for amusement, but they were entirely made by the teachers. So, there are two teachers at my school that do interesting things. The first is a fourth grade teacher. To demonstrate that racism sucks, she sets aside everyone with blue eyes. Until the end of the day they have to sit at the back of the classroom, can't go to recess, sit at the back of the lunch line, ect. ect. ect. The students don't have a clue what's going on until the teacher explains that this is how racism works, and why it sucks. 
The other teacher is teaching 5th graders about the revolutionary war. One day, the teacher dons a crown to class and makes everyone call him The King. He starts charging them to do mundane things. A penny to go to the bathroom. A quarter to go to recess. 50 cents to bring a water bottle, a quarter for a pencil, and they aren't allowed to bring pencils to class anymore, ect, ect, ect. On top of this, he starts to ignore basically anything the students request. He than makes them write a constitution and declaration of independence to free themselves. I always thought this was great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not exactly Unique, but fairly badass, I'll present to you something made quite a while ago. I present to you, playable mindflayer:

Illithid
Commonly called Mind Flayers, these evil, insane beings
are bred only to create destruction and madness.

RACIAL TRAITS
Avarage Heights: 6' 2" - 6' 6"
Avarage Weights: 175-215 lbs.

Ability Scores: +2 Charisma, +2 Wisdom or +2 Intelligence
Size: Meidum
Speed: 6 squares
Vision: Low-light

Languages: Common, Deep Speech.

Skill Bonuses: +2 Dungeoneering, +2 Intimidate.

Devourer of Brains: You have studied hard, but some of the knowledge you possess is not your own.
You either favoured a specific kind of brains or enjoyed the entire buffet.
 When you create your character you can choose to either gain a +3 bonus to one untrained skill of your choice,
 or a +1 bonus to all trained skills.
 This choice remains through your character's life and can not be retrained.

Aberrant Origin: Your ancestors were native to the Far Realm. You are considered an aberrant creature for the 
purpose
of effects that relate to creature origin.

Aberrant Mind: You have resist 5 psychic.

Aberrant Heritage: When your class grants you an utility power after 1st level, you can forgo taking that power.
Instead you gain an Illithid utility power of the same level or lower.
Telepathy: You can communicate telepathically with any creature within 5 square of you that has a language.
Mind Blast: You can use Mind Blast as an encounter power.

Mind Blast        Illithid Racial Power
You blast your foe with a torrent of psychic energy which
sends shockwaves through the air like heat waves of desert sand.
Encounter  Psychic
Minor Action   Close blast 3
Targets: Each creature in the blast
Attack: Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma vs. Will. You gain  a +2 bonus to the attack roll.
Level 11: The bonus increases to +4.
Level 21: The bonus increases to +6.
Hit: 1d6 + Charisma modifier damage, and the target is
slowed until the end of your next turn.
Special: When you create your character, choose an ability score you use when making
attack rolls with this power. The choice remains throughout your character's life and
does not change the power's other effects.

Playing an illithid
Most illithids are nothing but malice, spite and dominating forces in the world.
 They came from the Far Realm long ago and now reside largely in the Underdark. 
Illithid society is a free-for-all, with very little structure or hierarchy. 
Illithids commonly kill each other and devour each other for no other reason than pure sport. 
Parents abondon their young immediately after "birth".
 An illithid must make its own way through a hard, cruel and bitter existance.

However, maybe once or twice throughout all of the world's ancient history, 
a solitary illithid has broken from the sadistic traditions of its race. 
Illithids are viewed with fear and animosity, and not withour reason.
 Many races have a deep-rooted hatred of illithids and all that they stand for. 
Therefore, an illithid that has broken from its kind will face a great deal of hatred and anguish directed 
at it as it ventures into the world.
 A solitary illithid is most likely attacked on sight in most civilized societies. 
Most illithids detest the name Mind Flayer, growing wildly irate at its mention.

Perhaps the illithid was contacted by a god to fight in its cause,
 or perhaps ran across a mystical spell book which inspired it to find a new path for itself.
 Whatever its reason for adventuring, it must develop its own set of values and ethics, 
which a typical illithid lacks entirely. 

Illithid Characteristics: careful, foreign, insane, intellectual, megalomaniacal, mindful, scheming, cunning, 
sneaky.

 Illithids can use their transliterated Deep Speech names, but some who have forsaken their heritage 
translate their names into Common or another languages. 
Male and Female Deep Speech illithid names: Blorc, Flurr, Goipne, Grinrall, Huum, Klonre, Prar, Trell, Waerrl.
Male and Female Common illithid names: Dispair, Envy, Harm, Kill, Master, Pride, Pain, Slay, Spite, Wound, Wrath.

	<TEXT> First off, this is amazing. I can't even find the words to say how impressed and pleased I am with this. The only flaw I can see is saying it favors the fighter class. It might get a bit awkward when they want to use classic fighter armor like plate, chain, and scale. But other than that, I am simply amazing! Thank you for this, and I hope this works for your campaign! </TEXT>

I will consider using almost any request, and ones with more upvotes will get preference when it comes to which ones I will actually do. I will respond to your comments, once I know if I'll be making that race.

	<TITLE> My first attempt at a homebrew race. Also the weirdest thing I've ever thought of.  </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-02-09 21:36:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I recently read a post saying there should be half-dwarves, and I consulted my friend who had considerable knowledge on Dwarves. He told me that Dwarves reproduce differently than humans, by spores, like a mushroom. This gave me an idea. I searched through my Monster Manuals, and found a mushroom race, which I than turned into my own Homebrew race, called Shroom-Dwarves. I know this is ridiculous, but I find it to be amusing. 

Here are their stats (Note, this is 4e):
SHROOM-DWARVES

RACIAL TRAITS
Average height: 4'2"-5'0"
Average weight: 200-300 lb. 

Ability Scores: +2 Constitution +2 Wisdom
Size: Medium
Speed: 5
Vision: Blind, Tremorsense 10

Language: Common, Dwarven, Feyspeak 

Skill Bonuses: +2 Nature, +2 Endurance

Fey or Natural Origin: You can choose to be considered Fey or Natural Origin.

Encumbered Speed: You move your normal speed even when it would be reduced by armor or a heavy load. 

Ancestral Proficiency: Choose proficiency with throwing hammers and war hammers OR gain the ability to use staffs as an implement, and gain bonuses from them. 

Double Resistance: Gain five resistance to poison.

Pick one of the two following encounter powers: Roots of the Colony: you take half damage, and one of your allies takes equal damage. OR Sacrifice for the Colony: You take the damage dealt to an ally. 

Hallucinogenic Spores (daily power. Lasts until end of encounter): Aura 1. All enemies attempting an attack against you from within the aura take a -2 to hit. 

Also, I know feyspeak is not actually in D D. That is also homebrew. Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: I crossed Dwarves with mushrooms.  </TEXT>
