From Peadar:

My novel, The Call, came out in North America yesterday and will be published in the rest of the English-speaking world tomorrow. I sometimes describe it as "a Harry Potter where everybody dies". The Call deals with the abduction of teenagers by murderous Irish fairies and takes place in a special boarding school that's trying to teach them to survive.
I've written lots of short stories and three other novels, all of which were part of The Bone World Trilogy.
Catch me online on Wednesday from 1pm EDT (that's 6pm in Dublin/London, 7pm Paris, Berlin etc.). I'll hang around for 2 hours if the questions keep coming.
Ask me anything!
P.S. I blogged about this AMA here: http://peadarog.livejournal.com/229615.html </TEXT>

I know the description is a bit mysterious but I recommend not finding out too much about this book before you read it.  Better to see the story unfold without knowing whats coming or whats going on.  Just trust me, you will like this. 

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15062217-14)

There are some odd things about Nates new apartment. 

Of course, he has other things on his mind. He hates his job. He has no money in the bank. No girlfriend. No plans for the future. So while his new home isnt perfect, its livable. The rent is low, the property managers are friendly, and the odd little mysteries dont nag at him too much. 

At least, not until he meets Mandy, his neighbor across the hall, and notices something unusual about her apartment. And Xelas apartment. And Tims. And Veeks. 

Because every room in this old Los Angeles brownstone has a mystery or two. Mysteries that stretch back over a hundred years. Some of them are in plain sight. Some are behind locked doors. And all together these mysteries could mean the end of Nate and his friends. 

Or the end of everything...

From Carolyn:

Hi! I'm Carolyn Parkhurst, New York Times-bestselling author of the new novel Harmony, as well as three previous novels: The Dogs of Babel, Lost and Found and The Nobodies Album. I've also written a children's book, Cooking With Henry and Elliebelly, and my humor has appeared in The New Yorker and The Rumpus.
Harmony is about a family called the Hammonds: parents Alexandra and Josh and daughters Tilly (13) and Iris (11). Tilly is on the autism spectrum, and as her parents struggle with the challenges of raising her, they make the acquaintance of an enigmatic parenting guru named Scott Bean, who invites them to leave their ordinary life behind and join him in creating a "family camp" for families with special needs kids in New Hampshire. The story is told in alternating viewpoints by Alexandra (who tells the story of their life before they leave for the camp), Iris (who tells the story of what happens at the camp) and Tilly (who narrates from somewhere in the future).
I wrote this essay for the Wall Street Journal about what it was like to have my 14-year-old son, who has Asperger's and was my inspiration for the character of Tilly, read Harmony.

As director of the Center on National Security, I have spent years studying justice and law after 9/11. I have interviewed numerous policymakers and politicians, chronicled the incremental erosion of the rule of law and sat in the courtroom for dozens of terrorism and national security-related hearings. My most recent book, "Rogue Justice: The Making of the Security State," is the story of how American civil liberties were systematically lost after 9/11 and still have not recovered.

	<TEXT> #[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4v6ivn/james_renner_here_author_of_true_crime_addict_how/)

From James: 

Hello, Books! James Renner, here. It's great to be back.
My latest is a nonfiction thriller. True Crime Addict is mostly about the strange disappearance of UMass nursing student Maura Murray and the creepy clues I discovered while researching her case. But it's also about my own obsession with true crime and where that came from (spoiler alert - some dark family secrets are revealed). As I was researching the case I was raising a child on the autism spectrum who began to exhibit violent behavior so the story of that journey is in there, too.
A quick summary for those unfamiliar with this unsolved mystery: One Monday in February, 2004, Maura Murray emailed her professors to let them know there had been a death in the family and that she would return to her clinicals at the end of the week. This was a lie. Nobody had died. She emptied her bank account and drove hours north, into New Hampshire, where she crashed into a snow bank in the small town of Haverhill, around 7:30 p.m. Somewhere between the time of the accident and the moment the first police officer arrived on scene - no longer than 7 minutes - she vanished, never to be seen again.
In the news, Maura was made out to be the All-American girl, perfect to a fault. But then I uncovered the fact that she was in trouble for credit card fraud and identity theft at the time of her disappearance. And she'd been having an affair with an assistant track coach, who said she sometimes talked about running away.

From James: 

Hello, Books! James Renner, here. It's great to be back.
My latest is a nonfiction thriller. True Crime Addict is mostly about the strange disappearance of UMass nursing student Maura Murray and the creepy clues I discovered while researching her case. But it's also about my own obsession with true crime and where that came from (spoiler alert - some dark family secrets are revealed). As I was researching the case I was raising a child on the autism spectrum who began to exhibit violent behavior so the story of that journey is in there, too.
A quick summary for those unfamiliar with this unsolved mystery: One Monday in February, 2004, Maura Murray emailed her professors to let them know there had been a death in the family and that she would return to her clinicals at the end of the week. This was a lie. Nobody had died. She emptied her bank account and drove hours north, into New Hampshire, where she crashed into a snow bank in the small town of Haverhill, around 7:30 p.m. Somewhere between the time of the accident and the moment the first police officer arrived on scene - no longer than 7 minutes - she vanished, never to be seen again.
In the news, Maura was made out to be the All-American girl, perfect to a fault. But then I uncovered the fact that she was in trouble for credit card fraud and identity theft at the time of her disappearance. And she'd been having an affair with an assistant track coach, who said she sometimes talked about running away. There was plenty of reason for her to flee and start over, not the least of which was her family.

From the Team:

Hey Everyone,
Derek Young here (derekbruceyoung), designer and driver of Complete Control as seen on ABC's BattleBots.
I also was the designer and builder of Son of Smashy, the very first middleweight BB champion, Pressure Drop from Comedy Central's first season, and Complete Control versions 1-4 for Seasons 2 through 5. I'm a mechanical engineer who has built props in the film industry in Vancouver, built robots for bioscience research, worked on the worlds best electric superbike at Mission Motors and am currently a machine designer at Carbon3D, making 3D printing faster and better. I'm answering questions from the comfort of my couch in beautiful San Francisco CA. Personal website circa 2006: http://www.derekbruceyoung.com Fighting robot section: http://www.derekbruceyoung.com/robots/ Complete Control Facebook (many build pictures here!): https://www.facebook.com/completecontrolrobot/
Joining us will be team mates Ronen Sarig (robotronin) and Hanson Linek (plant_bot)
Ronen and I met while working at Mission Motors, an EV start-up in San Francisco. An electrical engineer by day, maker by night - I invited him to join the team for Season 1 (2015.) Ronen was responsible for the flamethrower (Blue Flame of Death), the electrical system, and a lot of the metal fabrication. http://www.RonenSarigDesigns.com
Hanson was brought in by Danny Haeg who he works with at the Tech Museum. A new addition to Mission Destruction, he joined up to help machining, welding and general fabrication. He made the button pushing finger.
Absent are Mission Destruction's other three members, Zacky Rubin, Danny Haeg and Super Intern Timmy who is actually in a yurt in Mongolia.
Big thanks to our sponsors

From Brian:

I work as the Chief Creative Officer at Insomniac Games and am a first-time author with the novel Song of the Deep (available at Barnes   Noble.) I was one of the three original members of Insomniac when we began as a tiny startup company in San Diego developing a little-known game called Disruptor. Over the last twenty-two years Ive helped create nearly thirty games, including our latest one, Song of the Deep, coming out on July 12th on Xbox One, PS4 and Steam.
Song of the Deep was a very special project for our team. Its ultimately about the great lengths we will go to help the people we love, and it was originally inspired by my then ten-year-old daughter. Its the story of a girl whose father disappears at sea, so she builds a submarine to search for him and in doing so discovers a secret underwater world.
Im very grateful to have had the opportunity to write this book, as I used to dream of being an author when I was a kid. So this is literally the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. Its also been one of my favorite games to work on, and the game development team has done an incredible job with the art, music, design and programming. I couldnt be more proud of how it turned out. I think the book and the game ended up complementing each other really well, each revealing different secrets about the undersea world and the hero of the story, Merryn.

	<DATE> 2016-07-01 05:09:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This month we have something a little different.  

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24237785-planetfall):

From the award-nominated author Emma Newman, comes a novel of how one secret withheld to protect humanitys future might be its undoing

Renata Ghali believed in Lee Suh-Mis vision of a world far beyond Earth, calling to humanity. A planet promising to reveal the truth about our place in the cosmos, untainted by overpopulation, pollution, and war. Ren believed in that vision enough to give up everything to follow Suh-Mi into the unknown. 

More than twenty-two years have passed since Ren and the rest of the faithful braved the starry abyss and established a colony at the base of an enigmatic alien structure where Suh-Mi has since resided, alone. All that time, Ren has worked hard as the colony's 3-D printer engineer, creating the tools necessary for human survival in an alien environment, and harboring a devastating secret.

Ren continues to perpetuate the lie forming the foundation of the colony for the good of her fellow colonists, despite the personal cost. Then a stranger appears, far too young to have been part of the first planetfall, a man who bears a remarkable resemblance to Suh-Mi. 

The truth Ren has concealed since planetfall can no longer be hidden. And its revelation might tear the colony apart </TEXT>

From Eliot:

Hi, Im Eliot Peper. I write fast-paced, deeply-researched stories with diverse casts that explore the intersection of technology and society.
My latest novel, Cumulus, is a dark, gritty science fiction story set in a near-future San Francisco Bay Area ravaged by economic inequality and persistent surveillance. My first three books constitute The Uncommon Series, which has attracted a cult following in Silicon Valley and is the #1 top-rated financial thriller on Amazon (think tech startup meets Panama Papers). Im currently working on a new story, Neon Fever Dream, about a dark secret hidden in the swirling dust and exultant revelry of Burning Man.
Ive helped build numerous technology businesses, survived dengue fever, translated Virgil's Aeneid from the original Latin, worked as an entrepreneur-in-residence at a venture capital firm, and explored the ancient Himalayan kingdom of Mustang.
AMA! Ill stick around until 4PM PST.

	<TEXT> We are very excited to be reading The Lions of Al-Rassan this month!

#[Discussion thread for The Lions of Al-Rassam by Guy Gavriel Key](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4ltery/bookclub_a_discussion_of_the_lions_of_alrassan_by/)

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104101.The_Lions_of_Al_Rassan):

The ruling Asharites of Al-Rassan have come from the desert sands, but over centuries, seduced by the sensuous pleasures of their new land, their stern piety has eroded. The Asharite empire has splintered into decadent city-states led by warring petty kings. King Almalik of Cartada is on the ascendancy, aided always by his friend and advisor, the notorious Ammar ibn Khairan  poet, diplomat, soldier  until a summer afternoon of savage brutality changes their relationship forever.

Meanwhile, in the north, the conquered Jaddites' most celebrated  and feared  military leader, Rodrigo Belmonte, driven into exile, leads his mercenary company south.

In the dangerous lands of Al-Rassan, these two men from different worlds meet and serve  for a time  the same master. Sharing their interwoven fate  and increasingly torn by her feelings  is Jehane, the accomplished court physician, whose own skills play an increasing role as Al-Rassan is swept to the brink of holy war, and beyond.

Hauntingly evocative of medieval Spain, The Lions of Al-Rassan is both a brilliant adventure and a deeply compelling story of love, divided loyalties, and what happens to men and women when hardening beliefs begin to remake  or destroy  a world.  </TEXT>

From Cate:  

Okay, I admit it, Im intimidated by this!
I mean, the legendary Reddit community is scary enough. (Ive been lurking around for a couple weeks, but damn, this place is BIG!).
And then add the other AMA authors into the mixPaulo Bacigalupi is here tomorrow? The Windup Girl author?!? Holy smokes. Hell have loads of intelligent things to say about climate change and how human society is totally entwined with our environment and how we can only adapt so much before we begin to fall apart. And I can tell you that hockey players are cute?
And was Charlaine Harris here the other day? Sookies mom. Im sure SHE didnt have anything interesting to talk about. (Alexander Skarsgard? Meh. If thats your type.)
But its okay, because the Reddit/books folks are kind enough to give me an example of the best AMAs from the past, so I can learn from those and things wont be scary at all. Except John Green? Khaled Hosseini? Dan Brown? --Okay, breath, Cate, thats fine, theyre very popular, but, you know, youre fine too. Youre okay.-- But then I see Margaret Atwood?!? Are you kidding me? Im Canadian! I cant I cant even Margaret Atwood?!? You expect me to be coherent when Im following in the footsteps of Margaret F-ing ATWOOD?!?
All right. Time to get myself under control. I have a different perspective than these authors. How about that? Im not a literary giant, not a master of my craft. Im a journeywoman. I work a full-time job, not writing. I have a couple different pen names and I write what I feel like and what seems to be selling at any given moment. I take my writing seriously and I care about my characters and I do my best (and I am in the running for a prestigious award this year, so suck it, Margaret Atwood! Youve never been a finalist for a Lamda Literary award!  well, okay, the Man Booker is pretty good, too. And I guess the Giller is nice. But, stillno Lammies, bitch!)
(Possibly I should have inquired about the Reddit/books policy on casual obscenities at some point. Especially when those obscenities are directed at National Treasures.)
Anyway. I write romance and YA romance as Cate Cameron (currently focusing on the Corrigan Falls Raiders series, with Winging It the most recent release), and m/m romance as Kate Sherwood. Im torn between being nervous that Redditors will ask really hard questions and being nervous that no one will ask any questions at all. MostlyIm here. Three hours, from 6:00-9:00pm EDT, May 25.

From Mike:

Hello, Reddit. Im author M.R.Carey. I wrote The Girl With All the Gifts (the novel and the screenplay for the movie) and I had a new book out last month, Fellside.

Hello everybody! Im Charlaine Harris and I have been writing since dinosaurs ruled the earth. In my long career, I have written traditional mysteries, harder-boiled mysteries, urban fantasy, a dash of romance and a bit of science fiction. My two most recent series are the Sookie Stackhouse novels and the MIDNIGHT, TEXAS books. The third installment in the Midnight, Texas series, NIGHT SHIFT, is now available from Ace. Its been my great good fortune to have to have three television adaptations: True Blood from the Sookie novels, my Aurora Teagarden books for Hallmark, and the Midnight, Texas series for NBCs fall 2016 lineup. I have a husband, three rescue dogs, three free-range children, and two grandchildren.

From Bart:

Hey all! Bart King here. I write funny books for younger readers and immature adults. Disney Hyperion just published my debut novel, a humorous science fiction adventure called The Drake Equation.
Ive also written over seventeen other books, including The Big Book of Boy Stuff (which was once Amazons top-selling kids book), The Big Book of Gross Stuff, and the hilarious An Architectural Guidebook to Portland. (Its medium-sized.)
I taught middle school for many years, which is how I got into writing. My reluctant readers inspired me on many searches to find books that theyd find perfectly irresistible . . . and it inspired me to try my hand at writing some.
Feel free to post questions here now! Starting at 6 pm Eastern Time (3 pm Pacific), I'll start answering and sharing thoughts on getting started in writing, finding an agent, the writing process, my books, humor, kids . . . you name it!

From Jodie:

Hello, I'm Jodie. I wrote The Society and The Girlfriend Request. I'm a Pitch Wars mentor this year for YA, and I've been a submissions intern for a publishing house. I live in a small town in Pennsylvania and have two children. I have a background in education and mental health counseling, and since I write YA, I tend to draw upon this experience when I'm writing. I'm a total Netflix binge watcher, and love Gilmore Girls, One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, Supernatural, Person of Interest, Criminal Minds, Revenge, and lots more. Really, my tastes run all over the place, depending what I'm in the mood to watch. I love to bake but not wash dishes. Coffee is one of my favorite food groups and I drink way too much of it when I'm writing.
I'll be starting at 6:30 pm EST and will be taking questions until 10:30 PM. I can't wait to hear your questions and chat with you! I hope you can join me. =)

From Tim: 

Greetings!
Stopping by this corner of the corner of the internet for the afternoon and happy to answer all questions you have for me. My latest work, Home Run, was released earlier this year and I'm currently continuing my tour of US middle schools with the hopes of inspiring young student athletes to pick up books - with the help of some NFL star-power.
I'll be returning here at 3pm to answer your questions and I'd love to touch on anything from my work as an author, to my former NFL days, to my work as a broadcaster, to my legal career and the crazy intersection between all four. This is my first time on Reddit, so you might have to bear with my at times but I am very excited for this session!
Bio:
After studying writing at Syracuse University where he was an All American football player, Tim was drafted in the first round of the NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons where he was a top defensive player for eight years.
While Tim played in the NFL, he also studied law and began his writing career. By the time he retired from football in 1994, Tim had already published his first book and become a lawyer. In addition to those two jobs, he began working as a television broadcaster for FOX NFL Sunday and other shows, including Battlebots, Good Morning America, Court TV, A Current Affair, and most recently, Find My Family.
After writing more than a dozen books for adults, Tim began writing a series of novels for young readers set in a world of sports taken from his own experiences as an athlete and a coach. In the meantime, Tim has visited over 1000 schools and spoken to nearly a half million students across the United States about the importance of education and character, in addition to the joys and benefits of reading!
