	<TEXT> So ecosia is a search engine that plants a tree every time you search, it makes money in the same way Google does but it all goes on trees. Charity miles is an app that pairs you with a corporate sponsor who will donate to your chosen charity dependant on how much you do (a bit like a charity fun run). Sharethemeal is an app from the UN (I think) that lets you give spare change amounts towards feeding hungry people. If you do a bit of research there's some really cool ways you can give to charity from your mobile  </TEXT>
