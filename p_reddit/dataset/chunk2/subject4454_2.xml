	<TEXT> Out of everyone I know other than a shitty fb group. Not one of my friends has a child with special needs. And I have friends who did drugs while pregnant. Which makes me even more pissed. Like where's the fucking cosmic justice. I did everything right when pregnant and before. I took prenatal vitamins, avoided sushi and cold cuts, no tuna, no soft cheeses.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I should be an expert and well adjusted as my son was diagnosed with autism at 15 months. And has been in programs ever since.

But idk, it seems as though as he gets older and misses more milestones I seem to hate autism and resent having him more and more. 

I love him but at the same time I regret ever having a kid. 

Even when I was pregnant, I knew it was possible to have a kid with a disability. When he was diagnosed I didn't have a problem. But it's seems as every day that I still have to change a diaper (he's 8 ) now or clean poop up off the floor, or deal with getting kicked just to brush teeth. Or see his 3 year old cousins do more and talk more than him. I just hate being a mom more and more. 

If he had autism and he spoke maybe it would be easier. Or at least could understand the concept of pooping in a toilet. But he can't. 

And I feel so alone, and monstrous for feeling like this. But this isn't the life I wanted. I can't live my dreams because for some reason the universe decided to screw me. 

I see other mom friends who go on the educational trips I enjoy or go camping which I'd like. And I can't do those things. He hates even sitting on the slide, how am I gonna get him to sleep in a tent. 

It's just really shitty. I never feel like I can go to friends houses. Mainly because he will tear it up. He doesn't respect people's things. If they have a smart TV he'll try to take it over. Just general chaos ensues. I go sometimes but especially if he strips we usually aren't invited back. </TEXT>

True but there has to be some kind of way to force people to consider your wants as an elderly person. I know that the kids can really push for certain things. I'm not very well versed in legal rights for the elderly. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Had a post and /u/bertweaze asked if i'd 1, lower my rate and then wanted a test article. I said I'd do a test article for the full rate of $15. 

He sends me the information over PM.

I tell him the work won't be done until Tuesday June 28th. This is because in addition to other things, I was planning on going somewhere for my birthday. And I don't work weekends. So he contacts me on the 24th of June and I tell him then the work won't be done until the 28th. 

On the morning of the 28th I get a PM telling me, that he didn't want that work. I was mid way thru finishing the writing. The research is done, the pictures had been picked out. All I have to do is finish the article and edit it. 

So he says he doesn't want the work. He wants some amazon descriptions done instead. So I say fine. I can do that. A week passes. no information. Then he says, hey, that project got scrapped, but hold onto the money cuz I've got something else going on.

Then I get a dispute in Paypal about how I didn't deliver the work. 

How can I deliver work for someone that changes their mind over and over again. And I've already done a bunch of the work and yet he keeps wanting me to restart. 


Don't do any work for him, he'll just jerk you around.

	<DATE> 2016-07-01 01:52:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  Is it better to have a Zero Copay Insurance with a Middling out of pocket maximum. And you regularly go to to doctor. Or a Low (read 10 - 40$) copay with a higher Out of pocket max.

The low copay you only pay like 5 - 30 for scripts
but I'd probably reach the out of pocket max on the zero copay in 2 or 3 months and not have to pay anything else at all afterwards.

I did want to get Weight Loss surgery. I have mental health problems and take like 3 scripts for that and I may have diabetes so there's all the medical tests and stuff that includes. 

Any advice would be appreciated. The facts are below. None of them include dental but they do include vision but only up to a point. 

**Low Copay Facts**

* After ACA Voucher $123
* Deductible - 1,000 ($500 / person)
* Out-Of Pocket Max - $4,000
* Primary Care - $5 copay 
* Specialist - $45 copay
* Generic Drugs - $5
* Brand - $30
* Diagnostic Tests - 20% after deductible
* Weight Loss Surgery - 50% after deductible 

**No Copay Facts**

* After ACA Voucher $161
* Deductible - $2200 ($1100 / person)
* Out-Of Pocket Max - $2,200
* Primary Care - $0 after Deductable 
* Specialist - $0 after Deductable
* Generic Drugs - 0 after deductable
* Brand - $0 after deductable
* Diagnostic Tests - 0 after deductible
* Weight loss surgery - no charge after deductible.

	<DATE> 2016-06-27 04:04:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay so I was thinking that [AMF Pleasant Valley](https://www.amf.com/location/amf-pleasant-valley-lanes/#0AeQ6) would be best. It seems situated right in the middle so to speak. 

I figure a sunday evening. Either 7pm or 8pm would be best. 

Maybe do 2 games, some pizza and sodas. 


So here are some choices for dates:

* July 10
* July 17
* July 24
* July 31

I suppose vote in the comments. 

I figure sunday is good cuz I believe it's 3$ shoes and games. so that would save everyone money. 

If it works out maybe we can do something else in August. 

I'd say not a movie cuz that's not really as social as it seems. Maybe we all hang out at orange leaf and pour pinapple juice over pinapple frozen yogurt and pretend we're at disney world. lol

I'll start 4 different comment threads for the dates, vote them up and i suppose comment.  </TEXT>

2. People post these things their kids did on facebook and honestly. I hate it. Because it reminds me just how much less my kid can do. Their kids will make them breakfast in bed, or do this thing or that, because they wanted to. And I'm working with none of that. Tho, I managed to get my son to paint a mug for his dad. But he doesn't know what day it is. And if he does he doesn't care or doesn't show it.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Found a client on craigslist. So, I'm supposed to edit his book for narrative quality and grammar, but the focus is on making it sound good.

Meanwhile, I've sent him 3 emails that stated that I require a deposit. I usually ask for 50% upfront and then the remainder at the end. 

However, since he's local, I told him to give me 25% up front and then pay the rest upon delivery. 

I've sent him 3 emails to this effect
the first 2 he said he didn't get and then later "found" in his junk email folder. 

He hasnt responded to the last email tho, i only sent it yesterday.

So I have a few questions:

Do you charge a deposit? If so, how much (percent wise)?

Should I just tell him find someone else, because he seems shady? Or give him a chance? He says he has 2 other books that need editing and that could net me a few thousand dollars. IF he pays.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My family moved to NC a few months ago and my husband works but he was supposed to get a raise but they haven't given it to him yet and I haven't been able to find a work. We make just enough to not qualify for foodstamps but with all the bills we are really strapped for cash. 

I've been trying to spend less than 50 bucks a week for food because with Rent, Electricity, Insurance and everythign like we're at our max money. But my son is super picky and it's really hard to just only eat rice and beans and things like that. 

I have been trying to get some permanent jobs but I've submitted at least 5 applications *a day to jobs of all type since we moved here and registered at 3 different temp agencies but still nothing. I've been told it's because I was a stay at home mom for so long. I couldn't even get hired by Sheetz (a gas station convenience store near me). In the mean time I've been catching freelance jobs on craigslist, reddit and doing mturk and things like that. Those are good but I only have like $5 in mturk. I did catch a job on craigslist last week tho. 

However, the client owes me some money but she's being really flighty and not answering emails. I was supposed to get that money by today but I haven't. 

I'm stuck cuz I need to buy milk and a few other things but I don't have any money. 

Amazon now delivers to my area. And i have a car and could go to any of the supermarkets near by which are Food Lion, Kroger and Harris Teeter. And there's a walmart and target. From what I can gather only  Walmart and Target do e-gift cards. 

I can pay back as soon as I get paid, via paypal, if that is a necessity. 

Thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would you rather be an electrician or anything else? (US) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My husband is a postal carrier, and he doesn't love it. He's a CCA so they're paid pretty badly and the management are kind of dicks. But all that aside. He complains that he doesn't have any skills. 

Since a bunch of my friends are all in unions, plumbers, electricians, steamfitters, bricklayers. I suggested maybe he become an apprentice. 

But for all you electricians (especially the union guys) would you rather be an electrician or anything else?

He was considering taking some night and online classes to get a computer science degree. But I think that being an electrician is a better route. because I figure even if it turns out he hates it, he can always become an electrical engineer. Or am I wrong about that? 

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> This is the last Week on Earth for A Family Friend </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-11 15:57:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> He's like my husbands Uncle by marriage. 

When I first met my husband, he was already a family joke. He was the guy that would promise to Jesus, his wife, his family, that he was all done with drinking. 

And he would be. 

For a month. 


And then he'd be off again, chasing the drink. I couldn't stand being around him (I don't think anyone really could). 

He always smelled of cheap vodka. A sickly smell, that always preceded him before he entered a room. Often before he told tales of how he was still very much sober, through the hard work of Jesus. 

And people went with it, even though he was full of bullshit and cheap vodka. Because what are you to do. Call him on it, and he gets mad and storms of on a week long bender? 

Or say nothing, and he secretly drinks him self stupid in his basement. 

He was a terrible man. He beat his wife, or so my mother in law tells me. Of course, he wife stood by him, like a good christian woman. Hoping that he'd become the decent, intelligent, kind man that he was when he wasn't drinking again. 

And why did he beat her? Because she was a teetotaler. She didn't drink. It was against her religion. And she was devout. I'm not a Pentecostal. I've traveled that journey once, it's not my thing. But her sincerity and dedication to her lord was, IS,  indisputable. She stayed with him because the bible said that divorce is a sin. And she prayed for him constantly to give up that bottle. And Will, beat her for it. He beat her for going to church. He beat her for not drinking. And be beat her because he's a son of a bitch. 

I hardly see the attraction, but I've been assured that before alcohol made him completely disgusting and unemployable that he was a highly skilled and apparently attractive man. 

He's not anymore. Alcohol took that away from him. 

And now he lay barely clinging on, withering away, frail, skinny, and pale at home, dying. 

Why?

Oh, an alcoholic knows why. 

Because, how was he supposed to celebrate when things went well?
How was he supposed to end a hard day after work?
How was he supposed to handle the stresses of the world?
How could he cope with all these bills he had?
What was he to do when everything was all messed up?
What was he supposed to do with all the free time?
What kind of person can't enjoy just one little drink?
How can he deal with the pain from the destruction of his liver? 
How could he handle the bad news that he was going to die?

Alcohol answered all those questions and more.  
Alcohol solved all his problems, if you consider death a solution. 

And I suppose it is.

At least for his wife, I hope he death brings her some peace. That he finally put down that bottle. 

As for me, I don't morn someone like that. Alcohol turned them into a beast. I only pray that it doesn't do the same to me as well.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I have an Associates degree in Accounting, a Bachelors in English. I've worked at places like Google and big name companies in NY.

I haven't had a steady office job since 2012. 
I did do a lot of freelance writing for the past 3 years. It ramped up until i was making about 12-15K a year. which isn't bad for a part-time esque job. 

I've read a few articles that say to volunteer for a bit to get "current work". 

I had tried a go at being a writer. And despite the adage that if you love doing something that you should make it your day job. I disagree. I did not like making something that was fun, into work. I prefer doing work like bookkeeping and accounting, for work. (I'm actually quite adept at it). And keeping my writing for writing. 

I just want a little 15 - 25 hour part time job. I just want to pay for my car and maybe buy stuff around the house. 

But basically every place I look for work complains that I haven't worked in 4 years as their reason for not hiring me. This includes places like Target and Starbucks and things like that. 

Any advice would be great. 

I'm sure this would help basically anyone else whos taken a few years off of working. 

I have considered going back to get my masters in accounting so I can get my CPA. But that's at least a year from now till I even apply. So in the meantime, i'd like to work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I'm going to relapse. It's something that I can see coming at me a mile away. 

We moved, from shot ass NYC, to North Carolina. But I'm bored and lonely. Bored and lonely were the 2 main factors to me picking up a drink as a solution in the first place. 

Not to mention that there's been a major hiccup with the apartment that we were supposed to get so we'll be in a hotel basically for a month.

Also, lets pile on some guilt, because I was so certain that just the prospect of moving would make everything magically better. Of course, as they always say in meetings: "Wherever you go, there you are."

Plus, as sure as I was of it. I thought, Oh, I won't miss my quasi-friends from AA. But I do.

	<TEXT> I was thinking today, upon some journeys that I'm going to be having in the next few weeks. (Moving to North Carolina from NYC) and I'm a little scared and nervous. 

What if it isn't the bright new start my family needs. What if nothing works out. What if the apartment falls thru and we end up living in a hotel or something stupid. What if nothing works out.

And then I thought, you know what would take the edge off. A drink.

But I can't just have one. I can't just get blotto tonight once and not want to do it all over again tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day until I've lost everyone and everything. 

Tho considering how down i am about my life trajectory in general, i don't think i'd care much right now. But I'm sure I'd care in 10 years. Or maybe 20. Or maybe when I'm sitting in a hospital bed finding out I've done something irreparable to myself, like drank my liver away. Or maybe watching TV to see my son has invented some big thing despite all the odds, and completely without me. That will be when I regret it. 

But right now I'm just really annoyed that I can't just have one. Because I know where it goes. And I'm just not prepared to make that gamble yet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel, and am pretty sure that it's a fact that I'm a failure.

I applied for a coding bootcamp. Because of a number of reasons, but mainly because I wanted someone else to tell me that I'm good enough and smart enough. 

Apparently, I'm neither. I didn't get in. 

Being as I completely screwed my career, I need an extra something to get me back into the proper work force. 

The freelance writing thing isn't going great. Work has been utterly dead since September. 

My husband goes back to work in a few days, he'd been out due to a workplace injury. And now I feel very alone and useless. 

I started drinking to excess because I hated being a Housewife. I felt like there had to be more to me than cooking and cleaning and bullshit like that. But apparently I'm wrong. 

I've failed at life. I'm starting to come to the realization that I'm just not supposed to be around anymore. 

Anyway, I'm not writing this to be like ah , save me. But to tell the person who hasn't fucked their entire life up yet. To not fuck up your entire life up. And stop drinking before you become a failure like me.  </TEXT>

He has an AA in Criminal Justice and a BA in PoliSci and Philosophy

He knows ruby and some HTML/CSS but he really isn't thrilled with web programming. he had learned a little bit of python in the past. And at one point was quite adept at Visual Basic.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been really tired lately, think I'll sleep an appropriate time at night but still sleep all day like 10 am to 2 pm. 

And over the past few days I've noticed that my feet were a little swollen. They're like really fucking swollen now. My husband broke his ankle a few months back and my foot looks like it did the 2nd day. Like maybe 2x the size. 

That swelling has recently moved up to the ankles and then today my whole lower leg / calf area is swelling.

I know I should definitely see a doctor. 

What I want to know is 1, could it possibly be Congestive heart failure?

2, can I wait the 2 or 3 days it'll take for me to get a doctor's appointment, should I go to a urgent care center tomorrow morning, or should I get my bass to the hospital ASAP? 

Either way I'm going to see a professional, just want to know what level of WTF, I'm dealing with.

I'm 32, Female, 5ft 5, 300lbs, black/native American.

I've been fatigued for about a month. The ankle thing has been going on for a week and spreading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to gather up the fee / deposit for by coding bootcamp. So that I can offer you cut-rate webdesign services at a later date.

So make an investment in me by hiring me for all your online based needs. 


**Writing**

I have a degree in English Language Arts from a very awesome school in NYC. I'm mildly funny (and funny looking) so if you need some comedy stylings I can make that happen. However, I find that my strongest suit is with technical documents, and web copy. 

Rates are competitive. For example, I'm willing to do a webpage for you (including lite CSS/HTML5 coding) for 150. without any coding it would be less. Contact me for more information. 

**Bookkeeping and Data Entry**

I worked for a number of years as a Junior Accountant for the corporate office of a very well known Gym. With all this experience under my belt, I can help you budget, perform data entry, and other financial and clerical type work. 

**Stock Photos**

I can provide you with a pack of 10 stock photos for $20. They are completely able to be used online without any fear.

**Random Drawing**

Since sometimes people just like to spend money on random stuff. I'm willing to draw you anything for $5 via paypal. Reminder, my drawing skills are not great. I can draw something really awesome but that takes hours of dedication, that would cost way more than $5. For $5 you get a drawing that took me about 15-20 minutes to create. 

I can provide an example picture if anyone would like. 

Thanks in advance!

	<TEXT> I applied to a coding bootcamp and I'm supposed to do a test before the interview. 

They say I can use whatever code I want but they *prefer* that I use ruby.

When they say prefer, Is that like the suggested personal essay in college applications? You know, where it's optional, but your best bet is to do it. 

Or is it like, use ruby cuz it makes it easier for them, but if your better at python, it might be better to do it in python. 


Another question: Has anyone ever been to coding bootcamp? How was it? did you like it? and depending on the route you went, would you have preferred to go a different way?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Today, I found out that an old friend of mine died November 11, 2015. 

She died of an OD. Either pills or Heroin. cuz that's the shit that people are heavily into around here. 

I had seen her posts on FB in the past few weeks and months. She'd been doing good. She stopped partying, was helping out with an animal rescue, was doing more shit with family and friends. Really reaching out and being part of her community. All those things that you are taught to do in recovery. 

Meanwhile I'm 600+ days into sobriety. Just kinda floating thru, resting on my laurels. Just getting shit done. Not making meetings, not getting involved, not reaching out to the next addict. Constantly considering, why I even needed to quit in the first place. Trying to rationalize a beer, or a pill, or something. 

And I don't know how it happened. Maybe she just said, One more time can't hurt. but it did.

Maybe she just said, No one cares about me, but they do, they really fucking do.

Maybe she just realized she couldn't go without a drink or a drug for the rest of her life. But she didn't need to go forever, just one more day, and try again the next. 

But that's not even the worse part. 

The worst part was going into the event page on FB for her memorial. And reading a list of none other than 34 different people, many of them younger than me. All of which had died from drugs this year. Some of them I didn't know, but SHE KNEW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. She had organized this massive memorial for all the people she had seen killed by this disease. Only to become another name on it's list. 

Don't pick up today. 

I'm 32 years old and the only person I knew who has more dead friends than me was my Grandfather and he died in June at the age of 88. 

So this post is for my buddy Emily, and all the other people who have gone too damn soon cuz of this disease.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I have this hope of taking my son to see the macy's thanksgiving day parade. However, short of paying for a fancy hotel / brunch at a hotel along the route. I don't think it's gonna happen. 

I have seen some people sitting in Bleacher seating along the route. So I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to get into that bleacher seating. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, 

Ever since my husband hurt himself on the job things have not been going well for me and my family. He was a Package Deliverer and made a very good income, but his injury has stopped him from working. We get workers comp, but you have to fill out these claim forms and then they tend to sit on them for an annoyingly long time. The most recent one we put in at the beginning of October has just been marked as received and we faxed it directly to them on October 2nd. During the time my husband has been injured, he has been taking online classes in computer programming. 

Recently, another vehicle came into my lane and as such I swerved to get out of the way which resulted in our car getting totaled. 

That being said we are due a decent sum by mid november. but in general the money that workers comp gives is 75% of what he would make in 40 hours, normally as a package deliverer he made 50 - 60 hours a week. so it really is a huge shift in income for us. 

I've been doing all I can to come up with additional ways to make money. I sometimes get work on the various reddit freelance pages, I had a decent long term writing job for one of those FB annoying quiz companies (but that ended in August), I did the elance thing, I signed up at all the temp agencies in my area, I've been applying to full and part-time work daily, and we've gotten some help from our church, families, people on this sub, and the like. 

I do have a job interview for a company in my area on Monday, I'm hoping i get that but it'll be at least 2 weeks before I see any money. 

I have a borrow request on r/borrow - for some money to pay my auto insurance (if you can help with that, i would be much obliged)

However, that not withstanding i basically have $15 for food for my family for the next 13 days. I also have enough bing search credits for a 10$ burger king gift card, and there is 1 food bank near me that I can get to easily but that's open on tuesday. 

So, how can you help?

The stores closest to me are: CVS, Walgreens, Shoprite, Dollar Tree, Stop   Shop, and a few local grocers

I can easily set up an order on any of these supermarkets websites that they'll deliver or let me pick up for a fee, if you're inclined to do that

You could buy my family a pizza or a gift card for dominos or papa johns

You could loan me some money on r/borrow

I suppose you can buy me stuff on amazon (but what i really need are things like chicken nuggets, flour, eggs and milk, butter, cereal and stuff like that.) basically mostly prime pantry stuff

alternatively,

I do have some things I can offer in exchange for other things:

obviously not the most financially sensible choice - I can buy you a victoria's secret egiftcard for 10% more than you help me out with. (basically it's the only credit card that we haven't fully tapped before asking for help)

I paid for a subscription to an online stock photo site for my writing jobs a while ago, and if you happen to need a bunch of stock photos I can download an agreed upon amount of photos to you in exchange for something (unless that's like illegal or something I don't really know)

I do have a degree in English and Bookkeeping. So should you need any work done that involves sums or writing, I could do that in exchange. 

So that's basically the gist. 

Thanks in advance

And I totally plan to do some pay it forward type stuff as in this time of struggle, I've been doing some reach out to others in my community where i can, donating old clothing and the like. And I plan on going on a missionary trip sometime next year, to help orphans in Asia.

	<TEXT> I don't even want to drink. Like I'm not thirsty or hard up for a drink or a drug. 

Things aren't working out very well for me or my family right now. Car is totaled, might be able to get maybe 75$ from the junk yard for it. 

And I've got maybe 13 bucks to buy food for my family til  I get some kind of cash influx. somehow. 

Nothing is working out. 

I don't even want to drink, couldn't afford to get one, and wouldn't even care for one. 

but I kinda feel like, with life sucking as much as it does right now, that It would be a good idea to just say screw it and drink it up. Like you know, at least, if i were drinking or using I'd have some excuse for my life not going well. 

Idk what the purpose of this is, but i suppose, the purpose is to just ge tit out there.  </TEXT>

this is likely the way wrong place for this. 

Or maybe somehow, someones words will help me see another way (I hope)

in the last 30 days the following things have happened:

I got into an accident (and due to a payment snafu didn't have auto insurance at the time) 
I got a charged in a separate incident with reckless driving (going 84 in a 70mph)
I just (as in 2 hours ago) got into another accident totaling my car. 
I'm like behind on rent
I'm at my edge
I can't do this anymore

So, if I feel like death or drinking is the only answer, shouldn't I go with the least permanent one? At least that's my theory. 

Idk maybe i'm wrong. maybe I'm wrong. 

I'm gonna use the phone a friend option but if things don't start lookign brighter fast I'm just completely done.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I Move to Raleigh, NC; Omaha, NE, or stay in NYC </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-12 06:59:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Trying to figure out if I should move my family of three or stay where we are?

The Facts:

We live in a 1br apartment in NYC, it's all we can afford at the high rate of rent (leading to 3 people in 1 small apartment)

We're looking to move into an apartment thats in the 500 to 1000 range for a 2br. Or we might just stay where we are until later. 

I'm a freelance writer; my husband is a mailman (tho he's quitting because he keeps getting hurt on the job)

Our son has autism (NonVerbal)

The Options:

Stay in NYC, be kinda poorish, but our church is here, and family is here. Unemployment rate is 6.1. Have no clue what we'll do for work haven't been able to get traditional employment other than little crap jobs and freelance work for the past few years. Also the schools kinda suck. 

Go to Raleigh, NC, change churches, husband wants to become an Electricians Apprentice in the Union there, I think I can get a book keeping job easily, Unemployment rate is 4.0, And they have a pretty decent autism education at the public schools

Go to Omaha, NE, change churches, husband isn't sure what he'll do out there, I am sure I can get some kinda work, Unemployment is 2.7. There is a lot of gang violence over there tho lots of shootings. There is a pretty decent Religious Autism School there but it's private so I'd have to pay something. 


So those are the choices. 

What do you think?

The husband wants to go to Raleigh, because he has a pretty decent plan to get work, and the place is nice. 

I want to go to Omaha, entirely based upon the fact that with a 2.7 unemployment rate we have to be able to get some kinda work. 

Our familes want us to stay put.

Other random facts, 

We're a mixed race couple

I have a BA in English and an AA in Accounting

I know I should do any other thing
but i'm all hella stressed
and I just want to make that feeling of stress go away. 

I know right now I'm doing the right thing by pre-telling on myself. But my brain is seriously telling me fuck that, get wasted it'll fix all your problems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so all i've wanted to do for the past month is take a bunch of oxy's and just nod the fuck out. Or get naked wasted. Do a bunch of amphetamines.  or you know whatever, just get out of my head. 

Part of this stems from the fact that I'm a ghostwriter and I was supposed to finish a book by July 7th, as we all see it's August 8th. 

I'm afraid i'm gonna get sued. I'm not doing any work. I sit around and sleep all day. 

I need to focus and get some work done. I keep thinking that if I get really high or drunk that I'll be able to pour words from my fingers into this book and finally finish it. 

But I've thus far resisted. but the more behind I am, the more I want to take something. 

I don't even know if I want like actual advice. I kinda am hoping for someone to say, "Go ahead subject4454 you know you need them pills / booze to do your work" 

but I know that it is totally a bad idea, shit a friend from the rooms just died from a pills overdose. 

but fuck if i don't want to pick up. If i can't get this book done soon. I know I will.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello!

Hi, I'm planning on moving to Raleigh around the 20th of September. 

In the past I've worked at places like Google, Zagat Survey (which later got bought by Google), Town Sports International (parent company of NYSC). 

I've worked as: 

* a content researcher
* a treasury management bookkeeper
* a freelance writer (I even ghostwrote a book)
* a quiz writer
* an retail operations supervisor

I know the following software and programming languages: 

* Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, Access, Outlook, Powerpoint and OneNote)
* Quick books (all iterations) 
* Oracle financial management platforms
* Xero
* Content Management Systems
* HTML
* Python 2.X

I am educated. I have an AA degree in Accounting and Office Management. I also completed (but haven't officially graduated) a BA in English Language Arts (focusing on English Linguistics). 

I pick up new software and programing languages very quickly. I am a hard worker and take pride in my work. 

I can come down for an interview with a 24 hour notice. 

PM me for my Resume and portfolio of writing samples. I am willing to do a skype interview or telephone interview as well. 

Thank you for considering me.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need Money for Milk and Stuff for dinner </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-02 21:34:02 </DATE>

	<TEXT> If I had anyone else to ask, I'd totally do it. 

I'm a very generous person and I really don't like asking for things. 

My husband has been out of work due to his broken ankle and workers comp is being really slow to come thru. 

I really just need like a 10$ target giftcard to help me buy a gallon of milk, and something for dinner. I went to a food pantry today but they didn't have milk and gave me stuff that my autistic son won't eat. 

For myself, I've got no problem eating oatmeal for dinner. but he really won't eat that. 

I am normally very very generous. Just in early July I donated like 300 dollars  of food and school supplies. 

Basically what happened was, he was supposed to get a check last friday for a couple thousand dollars.  (its back pay that he is owed since february) 

They still haven't processed the check. It's supposed to be processed by this coming friday the 7th. but idk what the hell is going on. 

I had a freelance job, but that ended and the final paycheck for that doesn't come until friday. 

I've been trying to get other part time gigs on /r/forhire but it hasn't worked out for me yet. And to be honest, I don't think it would do much good for me today anyways. 

All this is to say, I need at least $10 to buy a gallon of milk and some meat for my son (obvs I'm probably going to have some of the milk and meat.) if you can really spare an extra $5 or 10 so i can buy him some cereal and lunch stuff for school tomorrow, that would be great. 

either way, Thank you for any thoughts or prayers that you can put in to my family. 

I will do some kind of work for the money if necessary and I can definitely pay the money back by friday. Or at the very least I will pay it forward and give someone else a gift card to their local store next friday if need be. 

thanks. 

Also I will totally post a picture of the reciept and food that I brought for proof, if need be. heck, i'll even give you my home number so you can talk to me personally if you need to.  </TEXT>
