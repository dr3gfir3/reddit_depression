	<TITLE> I support feminism but I'm against the "free the nipple" campaign </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I am all for feminism and this campaign has a good message and everything; stop over sexualizing women's breasts (body in general)

Some so-called feminists miss the message and unfortunately only care about their topless social media photos being deleted. It just ruins it for other people who don't know the truth behind the campaign.

However, this campaign only focuses on breasts but how about the whole body? It really doesn't help with the overall message.

I don't know I probably sound insane and dumb lol </TEXT>
