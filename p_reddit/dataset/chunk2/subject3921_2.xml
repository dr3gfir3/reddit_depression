We couldnt be certain that I truly had some uncanny ability to seek and uncover the supernatural, but the next move was clear: forget about it. Whether or not our encounters were purely bad luck, they were certainly growing closer to home and more dangerous. If things had gone a little differently during the disturbed homeless mans attack, Lydia might have been hurt or worse and the school library had become a permanent center of rumor and uneasiness.

Brian had told people what hed seen, and the students wariness seemed to make the situation worse. Panic attacks began striking random students every week or so. Whether it was their own fears run wild - growing worse with each new panic attack story, the hysteria feeding on itself - or whether it was agitation of the otherwise harmless entity that roamed there it was impossible to say.

Either way, my concern for the effect my fear-seeking was having on the people around me finally exceeded my inner resentment of school and the life I felt forced to slog through. Still sleeping poorly and staying up far too late, I let my unending weariness dull my fear-tuned senses and drain my excitement for horror. I put it all aside, and got on with the circus of insanity that high school managed to perpetuate all by itself.

Turned out, I loved soccer. Id joined the team just to conflict with Josh, but he and Caitlin broke up, and we became amicable teammates. The longer nothing weird happened, and the longer I refused to think about horror or tell stories, the more everything faded. The very public stories of the house beyond the edge and the homeless mans attack became humorous memories. They lost their *realness*, and I became regarded as a normal teenager, for better or worse.

Nothing of relevant note happened for nearly two years. Id become wholly engaged in the constant battle for fulfillment and position that high school entailed, even if I didnt seek the same groupthink that everyone else seemed to. I based my reputation, as always, on being set against and apart from everything else.

Caitlin chose the opposite route. Her dating a soccer player was not a one-time thing. This often set us at odds in subtle and unhappy ways. Chris slowly got over the things that had happened by pretending they hadnt. He followed a similar path to Caitlins by pursuing leadership in band, the math team, the chess team, and student government.

This led to a latent, but powerful, strain between the three of us. By the time the homecoming dance of eleventh grade rolled around, I had my drivers license - and Chris had been dating Caitlin for a week. That bothered me for reasons I obviously couldnt vocalize. I had a girlfriend of a month at the time, so it shouldnt have mattered, but

On the surface, we were all still the best of friends. Per the plan for the dance, I picked the two of them up; my girlfriends house was the next stop. Clad in rented suits, Chris and I bantered back and forth, both attempting a Sean Connery accent and throwing out James Bond quotes. While extremely pretty in her dress, Caitlin stayed quiet, looking out the window.

The evening was a little nippy with mid-October chills - and Halloween season was upon us - but I ignored it all, intent on driving safely and having a good time.

Do we really have to pick up Nicole? Caitlin suddenly asked, referring to my girlfriend. We should just go to dinner ourselves.

I laughed, a small negative undercurrent beneath my positive exterior. Id almost expected something like this the moment she got in the car. Yes, yes we do have to pick her up.

Shes just kinda stupid, you know? she continued. Ive been meaning to say, youre really smart, and shes just not. I dont think you two are a good fit.

Not this again, Chris interrupted, darkly unhappy. You do this to every girl hes interested in.

She threw her hands up. Not my fault if he goes after the stupid ones.

I glared at her in the rear-view mirror. Stop.

Whatever She went back to looking out the window.

I pulled to a stop and went to Nicoles front door while they argued in the car. She looked amazing in her dress - better than Caitlin, in fact, and she knew it. She was a cheerleader, and prided herself on her appearance, and Caitlin was right. Although unmotivated because I hated school, I was very smart, and Nicole and I often had moments of total misunderstanding and confusion but she was a fine person. I often told myself that - she was a good person.

Once back in the car, it took about three minutes before she got in a fight with Caitlin, both girls exchanging veiled sarcastic comments. The subtle arguments and stinging comments continued through dinner at the restaurant, slowly involving Chris and I as well, despite our best efforts to calm everyone down.

Dinner was a blur of unhappiness. By the time we left there, heading for the dance, night had fallen - bringing with it an uncanny darkness. Clouds covered the moon as I drove, filled with anger, annoyance, and negativity I started noticing again.

The same things I found creepy about the Midwest landscape had not changed now that I was in a car. Although new places had sprung up in the last few years, it seemed there would always be the same underlying layout - a vast sprawl of interconnected dense pockets. They could be strip malls, suburbs, hubs around highway exits but there was always unkempt land in the spaces in between. There were always random fields and forests on one side of the road could be a massive suburb, and, on the other, centuries-old wilderness

My unhappiness and anger seemed to rise to a keening note as the car filled with shouts, and Caitlin and Nicole began pushing at each other around the passenger seat. I felt it coming, up ahead a particular spot on the right side of the road, among the overhanging trees. We were in between pockets, driving through dark forest and a very specific location up ahead seemed a little darker than the others, filling me with the most powerful reaction Id ever had abruptly, dangerously, I braked hard and pulled off of the road, squealing to a sliding forceful stop in the rough dirt.

*Stop!* I shouted at the top of my lungs, the single word lasting a good ten seconds. I only let the yell fade when I ran out of breath.

Nicole, Chris, and Caitlin all went silent, stunned by my uncharacteristic outburst.

I stared forward, making no further move for a moment. Little dots appeared on the windshield, and I could see flickering lines of rain falling through my headlights beams.

The stunned moment passing, I sensed Caitlin looking around. What did you do? she asked, peering out the window. I heard her breathing quicken. What *did you do?*

Chris put his forehead against his window, suddenly concerned. You dont think -?

My gaze traveled further up the headlights rain-flickering beams, out to the sturdy, high trees ahead. The darkness out there set the sense inside me vibrating with an almost physical force. I felt uneasy. It wasnt the trees ahead that were the problem turning around, I gazed through the back window with dismay. The eerie red light from my brake lights illuminated thick trees behind us, too

What? Nicole asked. He just pulled off the road because youre being a b-

Stay in the car, Caitlin interrupted, opening her door slowly.

Uh, why? Nicole began to ask.

Caitlin hissed at her. *Stay in the goddamn car!*

Dont go out there Chris breathed, but she didnt listen.

I opened my door and stepped out as well, leaving my fancy dress jacket inside.

Where are we? she asked, looking over the roof at me.

I shook my head - I didnt know. Old-growth trees surrounded us but an open carpet of leaves ran under them, completely devoid of the tangled undergrowth that should have been there. This forest was more like the ones I remembered from my previous home on the East Coast filled with thick, ancient trees that made undergrowth impossible.

Even worse - the road was nowhere to be seen.

Caitlin held her hand up, feeling the light rain that filtered through a gap in the trees high above. Further out, we could hear heavier drops of accumulated water falling from leaves. The sound came from all around us, audible over the grumbling of my cars engine.

So, what? she demanded. Is this some parallel nightmare reality? Or did we go back in time or something? What did you *do?*

I dont *know!* I shot back, my anger slowly turning into an uncontrollable smile as I thought about it. Despite myself, I couldnt help but laugh. But that would be freaking awesome.

Her cheeks shot up around a sudden massive grin. It would be, wouldnt it?

Chris emerged from the car, glaring darkly at the two of us. Whats so funny?

Nicole popped her door open and completed the over-the-roof circle of conversation. Whats going on, wheres the road?

I peered into the darkness, able to discern a few outlines, dark against black. Looks like theres a hill over there, so we should go climb it and look for the road.

Yeah, Caitlin added, excited. Lets go off into the woods.

 I suppose we should split up, too? Chris groaned.

Nicole glared at him. *Hell no?*

I pulled the keys out, silencing my car, but leaving the lights on. Fighting down a constant grin born of excitement at my own fear, I led the way between the trees, sticking to the long beam from my cars headlights. Without the rumbling sound from the engine, the forest became much louder, radiating the sound of shifting leaves, falling drops, and an occasional unexplained snap or crack from somewhere in the darkness.

Each scary sound had Nicole gripping my arm. I felt quite manly, for as long as the headlights lasted but the beams faded with distance, and we were forced to let our eyes adjust before moving into pitch darkness. My only hope was that *some sort of road* would be visible from up the slope, lit by streetlights or buildings or *something*

Something snapped to our left. I had sudden flashbacks to the pitch black gymnasium, and waiting in terrified silence as something horrible crept up near my face. I had the sudden urge to abandon the trek to the hill and run back to the car but wed still be stuck in the middle of unknown forest

Chris, just watch our left, I ordered, creeping forward into the darkness. Caitlin, watch the right. Nicole, scream if you see anything weird.

She squeezed my arm harder. I was planning on it.

As I grew used to the darkness, I found myself barely able to make out forms and shapes, lit by the barest moonlight filtering through clouds and canopy. I had to keep moving my head from side to side, using the corners of my vision to detect the slightest changes in dark and black

Chris backed up against me. Jesus Christ!

We looked to the left as a group. I saw nothing strange at first, until I noticed a distinct branch resting at an odd angle it was noticeably bright red, even in the dark, and rather rotted I tilted my head, curious it moved, disappearing behind a tree. I grabbed Nicoles mouth to muffle her scream.

It had been a leg.

Back to the car! Chris hissed through clenched teeth.

No, I replied, making the hard call. Forward. Just run!

They listened, and we ran as a group. The flat landscape, covered in wet leaves, made for easy running - and even easier slipping. Several times, someone fell, and we hurriedly picked them up and continued running. The sounds of snapping nearly matched us, slowly falling behind, now including a strange hissing, breathing sound

The grounds angle turned up, and we pounded up, reaching the crest of the hill.

Lights! Caitlin pointed.

She was right. Off in the distance, we could see an unidentifiable building and a brightly-lit gas station, and a road! The hill led back down, and we ran at full speed, until I noticed gaps on the horizon to our left and right. The chilly wind tipped the rest of the group off.

No, no no no no! Chris shouted. A river? No!

A wide, flat, murmuring black plane lay between us and the distant gas station. A dozen crackling and breathing sounds came from several places in the woods behind us.

I cant swim, Nicole said, depressed.

You cant? Caitlin asked, a note of panic in her voice.

Nicole sighed. Itll ruin my dress.

Caitlins concern dropped to a flat, stony expression. Ill fix that. She bent down, scooped up some mud, and threw it at the squealing girl. Problem solved. Now get in the river!

Heart pounding, I followed Nicoles terrified shrieks into the water, and Caitlin and Chris splashed in after me. The ice-cold water brought pain and a certain irresistible terror - I never liked swimming in anything that wasnt a pool, because Id always imagine horrible things in the deep, waiting for a chance to grab my legs

But there was no choice, now.

Struggling to stay as high up in the icy black as I could, I swam after Chris and Caitlin, who had passed me during my initial hesitation. A low sound similar to a chuckle flowed over me from behind unable to resist the urge, I looked back.

Silhouettes of misshapen, rotting things slid under the water from the shore, pursuing us from the woods. I couldnt be sure, but they looked like mauled corpses, moving in impossible, ungainly ways, mostly an assortment of animals - but one vaguely human.

The split skull of the humanoid sank beneath the black plane of the water, staring at me with a rotted, horrible grin. I had the distinct impression that it somehow knew my unreasonable fear of the water, and it was more than eager to make it come true

Go, go! I shouted ahead, splashing after the others. Truly completely terrified for the first time in my life, I fought my numbing limbs to swim as fast as I could, cursing my restrictive dress clothing. There was no way to know whether the horrible rotting things were catching up to us in the water

Ahead of the three of us, Nicole screamed.

Tiring, and only halfway across, we swam up to the spot where she thrashed and struggled. My leg! she shouted.

I dove under while Chris and Caitlin tried to keep her from being pulled under. The freezing shock against my face almost had me breathe in water - but I fought against it, and fought my keening terror to swim *down* I could feel rushing emptiness all around me, the dark and chill increasing below, into unknown depths

Fingers. It was fingers.

A boney, slimy hand had a grip on her ankle. Surging with adrenaline, I did the only thing I could think of - I gripped two fingers in each hand, and pulled apart.

The hand ripped in half. I could feel the rotting flesh giving way, sinew by sinew.

Nicole kicked away, and I thrashed for the surface.

Theyre in the water! I shouted, but the group was already screaming and swimming for their lives. The things under the water gripped at us and swatted for our limbs, but we were almost there

Corpse-silhouettes emerged from the water ahead, waiting and watching us expectantly.

We were forced to stop and tread water, a profound despair falling over us.

We cant get out we cant escape Chris breathed, looking over at me. Im sorry for being a terrible friend.

Totally numb, I shook my head. Its fine, man.

What *are* those things? Nicole asked, her voice shaking. Why are they after us?

It doesnt matter, Caitlin said, shivering. Theyve got us.

I watched the humanoid corpse as it gazed at us. It just stood there, on the shore, grinning

No theres one more thing I looked at the three of them as they tread and shivered. Are you scared?

Yes! Nicole shouted, terrified and angry, but Chris and Caitlin just nodded.

I drew in a breath, letting the cold fill me. Then lets just float downriver for a little, see what comes up.

Id never felt anything quite like those moments. Mortal danger was a thing, in those moments, and it didnt overwhelm me anymore, didnt frighten me. The situation seemed grim, the corpse-things shambled along the shore, trailing us they knew the cold would get us very soon I wondered at their origin, their motivations, but it wasnt *their* story that mattered

I let my senses flood. The chill night breeze, the slight pattering rain, the deadly icy water we floated in, serene and despairing and those curious blank spots in my awareness, still there, even years later - gaps in my simulated fears, emotional dead spots, just a few, all on one side of the river, near the gas-station

Ignoring them, I focused on my animalistic terror of deep, unknown water.  I could feel *it*, up ahead as we drifted downriver, waiting for us

Cross back the other way, I rasped, breathing too hard to yell.

Nodding, too exhausted and cold to argue, they began swimming toward the forested shore. The humanoid corpse gave another low, disgusting laugh, and the rotting things slid back into the water, intent on beating us to the other shore and waiting for us there. The back-and-forth would continue until we had no more strength left

A wave of pressure in the water moved up against my body, and I cringed away, terrified. Back, back! The others followed, and we swam away from the middle, back towards the gas station.

A great flailing and splashing erupted behind us, but none of us had the energy to look. We scrambled ashore, breathing desperately and struggling to recover. Nicole and Chris stumbled for the gas station without hesitation.

As always, I looked back - and this time, Caitlin stopped and looked, too.

A barely discernible depression in the water whirled the black with uncanny force.

What is it? Caitlin asked, grabbing my wrist.

I shook my head. A sinkhole under the river? Some sort of creature, hiding under there, feeding on animals? I dont know. Either way, it scared the hell out of me. Ive always been scared of the deep. Another few feet forward and wed be down there, too

But howd you know? Howd you know it was there?

I had no explanation.

Just like that, the danger was over. Our terrified flight in the dark had left my heart pounding and my body on edge, but we'd survived... I just stood there with Caitlin for a few minutes, trying to recover.

Chris came running back, horrified. Its - its - worse than you can imagine!

Caitlin squeezed my wrist. God, what is it? Where are we? Is it a nightmare world? I thought it might be.

He gulped and widened his eyes. Worse. Were in *western Virginia.*

You asshole! I pushed him, laughing.

He immediately dropped the act and began cracking up. I had you! *For once,* I had you!

Caitlin just shook her head and smiled broadly, still shivering.

Recovering control, he looked back. That building beside the gas station, its auto repair. The dude will help us tow our car to the road. Were near somewhere called Blacksburg, and Claytor Lake.

The drive back took over five hours. Nicole was angry the entire way. We *missed homecoming,* she kept complaining, as if that was somehow important compared to the nights events.

Chris had a big map out the mechanic had given him. This river splits a few times, but it runs all the way up right near where we live back in Ohio think thats important?

Weird, I responded, my eyes on the road. I dont think so, unless youre afraid of potential river monsters. It could always come up the river and wait is it *the* river? The one the gorge runs to? And the school is near it, and the house beyond the edge was -

I cant tell.

Oh. Well, I did also live in Virginia before I moved to Ohio. I recognized this kind of forest immediately.

Chris stared at me through the rear-view mirror. You mean you know the area?

No, never been here.

I mean the details, the landscape. We turned off the road in Ohio and ended up somewhere else in the world - but it was *somewhere you were familiar with?* Whats the chance of that?

Caitlin wiped dried mud from her dress and leaned forward, grinning. Can we play with this now? Ive been waiting years. Its obvious you cant ignore it now.

We could have died out there, I countered, looking over at Nicole, sleeping unhappily in the passenger seat. Bedraggled and dirty, shed had no idea what she was involved in and yet, shed been just as endangered as the rest of us.

Maybe, Caitlin replied, still eager. But the mystery is there whether you want it or not. Its time to figure out whats really going on.

I shrugged, turned up the heat, and rolled down the window to run my senses across the passing landscape. I contemplated the history at hand all the things that happened, how theyd started, how theyd played out was any of this even real? Were we just sharing intense imaginings?

Chris drew in a sharp breath. Um

Something squirmed in my lap, having fallen out of some tuck in my ruined dress clothes. I thrashed around, reaching for it as I tried to keep the steering wheel stable. Grabbing the disgusting thing and lifting it with a horrified stare - I hurled the moldy, red, rotting finger out the open window.

[The Gorge](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14ab2p/the_gorge/)

Halloween came soon after our incident at the gorge, and the season was a fantastic one for me. Id been inspired - the flickering ghost at the house could have just been a once-in-a-lifetime encounter, but the strange beings passing through the gorge near our neighborhood proved that the supernatural was *real!* It was my dream as a horror fan, and now a spinner of my own tales, come true.

My position as a high school freshman seemed to be rising. I wasnt integrated into any groups, per se, but became more of a freelance, known for a heavy soda habit and telling intense scary stories. My reputation and subtle distance from everyone else suited me just fine. High school was just this white-walled *place* I went for eight hours a day.  It was not just an allegory for prison. It *was* a prison.

I was bored out of my mind most of the time, and thoroughly enjoying messing with people through horror stories. The Halloween season made them extra vulnerable to fear. I wasnt sure where things would go once the season passed and scary stories fell out of favor, but I was having fun with it until, out of nowhere, Caitlin suddenly started dating a soccer player.

Chris and I were not speaking. Wed had a falling out after the incident at the gorge. Hed been depressed and morose ever since. That left Caitlin and I, briefly, until Josh entered the picture. I hadnt even been aware she *talked* to anyone from the sports crowd, let alone found them interesting enough to date one.

My stories took on a darker, angrier tone. I also joined the soccer team midseason, although I literally had no idea how to play. I wasnt extremely terrible, for a freshman, but my presence certainly irked Josh. I more than made my dislike clear. Our rivalry reached a breaking point in November, near the end of the soccer season.

The final encounter began after a soccer practice ended. Most everyone else had gone home, but I still lingered in the schools front hall, resting up for the walk home.

Chris stumbled through the main doors, shoved from behind.

Josh came in behind him, followed by two of his cronies - and Caitlin. I frowned at her, and she gave a concerned expression of apology.

Chris here says its you, Josh accused, doing his best to tower over me.

I glared back at him, not about to back down from his attempted intimidation. Whats me?

Ive heard all about your little stories, he responded, his tone mocking. Caitlin talks you up all the time. But Chris here, he says theyre real. That its you. Youve convinced these two that your stories are real.

Chris shoved away Joshs grip and grimaced at me. Sorry but what I said was I just think sometimes you tell stories that are too real. People can get confused.

Though I didnt show it, I felt a little dismayed but if that was what Chris had to believe to feel better about the encounters I guess I couldnt blame him.

Josh interrupted. Im just tired of everyone listening to you like youre somebody. Youre just a freshman. Youre nobody. He stepped even closer. So lets hear it. *Scare us.* Find us a real ghost. Or make us believe some story. I dont think you can do it.

His aim was to embarrass me in front of Caitlin, that much was obvious - but Id had it with his crap, and I was already full of anger and resentment from too many other things

I stared him down. Alright.

Dont - Chris began to plead, but Josh shoved him aside.

I took in a slow breath and closed my eyes. The story-spinning craft Id been developing had fine-tuned my awareness. Horror seemed empowered by details, by surroundings, and the environment I was constantly aware of little sounds, or certain spaces. I pulled these things to me, collecting them, testing them against a taut string in my chest - my sense of fear, which Id learned to adjust to mimic my audiences reactions.

I opened my eyes, a little confused. More than a few times, Id sensed gaps in the world around me. Certain spots gave off what could only be described as *nothing*. They were emotionally blank. This sensation threw me off, and disrupted my sharp anger.

Shaking my head, I walked slowly down the hall, feeling the fear reaction in me start up again - rising as I walked. I followed it like a dowsing rod.

Wheres he going? one of Joshs friends asked.

Shut up man, just follow him. It sounded as if, at least for the moment, Josh was actually engaged.

They walked behind me as I felt myself led to the school library. Uncertain what was happening, I grabbed a book from the quiet shelves. The library felt strange without anyone inside it, lit only by dim November afternoon filtering through the windows following my lead, they each grabbed a book.

I sat at a table in the middle of the room. They sat on either side of me, forming a long row. Josh made sure to sit next to me, a snide look on his face.

I raised the book to my face, blocking most of my forward vision. They did the same, confused. One of the guys laughed. Chris looked pained, while Caitlin, on the other side of Josh, seemed excited.

What was I doing? Where was this going? With each action, the responsive fear in me had grown a little stronger. Why was the dim, empty library filling me with fear? I felt around the logic of the room with my mind

Attracted by an active imagination, attracted by the act *of* imagination, it approaches slowly. It uses an angle visually blocked by the book itself. It depends on the reader being immersed and absorbed.

They quieted, suddenly aware that none of us could see forward.

So far, it has been content with keeping a low profile, by restricting itself to subtly draining the victims psyche and will. It leaves them tired and sore after a few hours, even though they were just sitting there reading you might recognize that feeling. The bodys normal defense mechanism is a periodic look around, with an inexplicable sense of something amiss

Josh frowned. His two friends exchanged glances. A rising sense of vulnerability overtook the group. I could tell they wanted to drop their books and look.

That periodic momentary awareness sends it running, for a time, preventing serious mental damage but now, six potential victims at the same table are ignoring that impulse, keeping their books up, refusing to answer their fear and it begins to wonder - do these six *know?* It begins to feel threatened it begins to wonder if it should use its precious energy to lash out at one but which one? It flickers closer, approaching the back of one of the books

Caitlin tensed. Chris looked extremely unhappy. I could feel the groups emotions rising to a sharp point as the overpowering sense of *something approaching behind our books* became unbearable I thought I could even hear the barest hint of something winding up, preparing to strike

Josh slammed his book on the table, loudly disrupting the moment. Although he seemed subtly shaken, he put on a show of anger. This is crap. Theres nothing here. Its the *school library.* Come on.

We lowered our books.

I looked around, eyes narrowed. The rising note of fear had flitted away, reduced to a subtle lurking tension somewhere distant.

Look, Josh continued. If you cant deliver

Fine. I stood. Filled with anger, I slammed a hand flat on the table. But you asked for it.

Imbuing the taut sense in my heart with a surge of fire and dark intent, I followed it out of the library and into the hall. It led us quickly to the large, open gymnasium. Shrouded in darkness, the windowless space arched over us, a chill flowing void lit only by a spike of light from the hallway doors.

So theres *two* hauntings in the school? Josh asked, unimpressed.

I shook my head. The horrible floating thing in the library didnt feel like a ghost. I think theyre quite numerous, but content to remain subtle and unseen, feeding on the minds of unsuspecting readers. I think the worst thing that could happen with those is looking up without warning and accidentally seeing one unless you frighten it, and it lashes out

I drank in the sensations of the gyms vast blackness and quiet, comparing the texture to that first encounter in that houses basement. And this doesnt feel like a ghost, either. This this is something else I didnt mention the anger I felt reflected back at me.

Chris shook his head, highly unhappy, but Josh pushed him along with us. We began trekking across the gym, sinking deeper into inky darkness. Our shoes echoed weirdly against the smooth floor, squealing occasionally. Nervous laughter made a round through the group as it became harder to see one another.

Our pace slowed as the darkness grew nearly complete. I could only see them out of the corner of my eye, and we began stumbling forward, wondering when the opposite wall of the gym would suddenly bump into us.

Were not supposed to be here Chris moaned. Well never reach the -

We came up against the opposite wall. Oh.

Caitlin looked back. Does that seem really far away to you?

Indeed, the two tiny squares of light in the hallway doors seemed oddly small and distant. The others were only the barest silhouettes in the corner of my vision.

Its just a dark gym, Josh said dismissively. Theres -

A circle of darkness interrupted one of the squares of light in the distance. The silhouette of a head disappeared as quickly as it came. While we peered at the doors, one opened and shut, spilling a wide arc of light across the floor - a brief light that somehow failed to reach us at all.

Who was that? one of the guys whispered. Theres nobody else here.

A janitor or something? the other guy whispered back.

Why would he be walking around in here in the dark? Caitlin asked.

Its not a janitor, its something horrible, Chris muttered.

Shut up! Josh whispered.

Slow steps echoed somewhere ahead, to our right. Heavy, flat, they sounded four, five, six times and stopped.

We kept still, straining our ears.

Lighter footfalls echoed from somewhere to our left, a rapid series that ended as quickly as they began.

Silence fell again.

Screw this, Chris whispered, frantic. I am *out of here.*

Good plan, one of the guys whispered, before being punched in the shoulder by Josh.

We worked our way slowly and quietly down the wall, unable to see anything, but remembering that a door at the end led straight outside. The painful tension only rose as the silence in the gym continued, offering no explanation for the two pairs of footsteps or the shadow that had entered the darkness before that. If someone else *was* in the void with us, they were sitting still, listening, waiting

A whisper sounded near my ear, about three inches away. Hello?

The voice was gruff, older. I froze mid-step as warm, foul breath flowed across my ear. No one else in the group made a sound. My heart beat like a hammer each beat dragging across the moment like a knife. I had a brief terror that it was the largest shadow-creature from the gorge. It'd stared back at me as Id watched it and now, it had finally found me

The lighter steps exploded to our left, and somebody slammed their way out through the dark doors on that side.

Damn! the voice next to me muttered, and the heavier footfalls erupted from next to me, racing after the first set. We stayed frozen as the doors on the side of the gym slammed open a second time.

What the *hell* was that? Josh asked.

It occurred to us that somebody might actually be in trouble.

As a group, we rushed after the footsteps, following a girls scream, echoing through the halls in response to our commotion.

Josh and his buddies sprinted ahead as we rounded a corner, grabbing and beating someone. Lydia, a junior girl I recognized from student politics, cowered against the wall. Terrified, she just kept screaming. The brawl split, and the man bolted down the hall.

Dressed in rough sweaters and a cap, the homeless man glared back at us for a second, muttering something incoherent. He pushed through the front door - which *we* had left propped slightly open, so as to wait inside after soccer practice, instead of out in the cold

We were left stunned, confused, shaking - but alright.

The next day, we were subject to a series of lectures and interrogations about the incident. Nobody had been hurt, strictly speaking, but Lydia - staying after school for a project - had been scared half to death. None of us mentioned how we happened across her pursuer. Highly disturbed by what had happened, Josh and his buddies left me alone after that.

The one positive from the event was that Chris began speaking to me again. He found me in study hall, reading a book. Every time, he said quietly, so that nobody else would hear our conversation. You seek these things, and *there they are.*

A little shaken by the disturbed homeless mans attack myself, I just shrugged. Yeah but that wasnt supernatural.

No? Chris replied. You know Brian had to go home this morning? He had a panic attack, freaked out.

I frowned. The kid was a known - and annoying - hypochondriac. Poor Brian?

He said he *saw something*, that it attacked him while he was reading - in the library.

I put my book down and slid it away, regarding it with sudden horror.

Chris leaned in close, his eyes grim. But you didnt tell anyone else that story

	<TEXT> Prior to writing this all out, I never really suspected a possible connection with [the incident at the house](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/147wn3/the_house_beyond_the_edge/) - but I stopped sleeping right around that time. From seventh grade until my junior year of college, I would continue to stay up late every single night, and sleep horribly if I slept at all. The culprits were many - video games, a new-found love of soda, a rising undercurrent of hatred for *school*, which felt increasingly like a prison and a strong appreciation for the quiet void of night.

I often walked my neighborhood at night, and sometimes dared to venture into the nearby woods. The area was very safe, and the neighborhood association had recently built nice paths, steps, and boardwalks that went all the way down to the river, so sneaking out to walk around was more a product of boredom than any sort of fear-seeking. It was one of those nights, in the early autumn of ninth grade, that I saw something out in the forest.

I was no fool. I immediately went home, intent on returning the next day. I actually slept well for once, excited for a Saturday trek to investigate what Id seen. Itd been almost two years since the incident at the house, and life was starting to feel agonizingly bland again.

I called to get the old band back together, but Hans had since gone back to Germany.

Chris arrived first. He seemed hesitant. Hed been a little skittish ever since our encounter at the house; he'd often said he wished it hadnt happened. His sarcasm had quieted in the last two years. Im not going inside anything, he muttered, without greeting. No houses, no caves, nothing.

I nodded. Thats fine.

Caitlin showed up a few minutes later with a broad smile. Id only seen her once that summer, briefly, and she seemed older than I remembered, somehow. This was certainly not the same weird girl from middle school. Whatd you see? she asked, excited.

He said it was blue, Chris responded, crossing his arms.

Yeah. I looked at the trail that led into the woods. A dim blue light in the distance, really hard to see, but definitely somewhere down the gorge. It hurt my eyes.

She immediately headed for the trail. Well lets go then!

We followed the easy trail along the left side of the gorge. The cut in the earth was deep and sheer, but there were numerous wooden rails, and this was more a park than wilderness. This was also not the main river, though a heavy creek did flow along the bottom, swelled by recent rains.

The path on our side ended rather abruptly. The path on the other side of the gorge continued, accessible by bridge all the way back where wed started, but it led away, heading toward the main river.

Thats it, then, Chris said, shrugging. Cant go further.

Bull, Caitlin responded, sliding through the wooden rail.

Chris rushed to the rail. What are you *doing?*

I was a little concerned myself.

Look, its not so steep here theres roots, and dirt, not just rock. It looks like other people go down this, she explained, working her way down. Older kids probably come here to smoke.

I laughed and slid through the rail. The steep dirt was made traversable by a few perfectly placed roots that jutted out like handholds. It was nerve-wracking, climbing down, but I never felt in danger. At the worst, if I fell, I would slide down the dirt painfully. Come on! I yelled up to Chris.

He followed only under protest, as he made abundantly clear for the entire climb down.

Once down, I took stock of the surroundings. The gorge was about fifty feet high on either side, blocking out all but the immediate sounds of nature. The narrow dirt slope wed slid down ended just below an abrupt waterfall basin. While quite beautiful, the waterfall made it impossible to travel that direction. If the creek had been dry, we might have climbed the rock shelf, but, for now, it was a loud wall of water spraying us with mist.

No matter. Id seen the strange blue light in the other direction, further down the gorge.

I led, and we picked our way downstream, sticking to the sides where dry passage was possible. A few minutes in, a light pattering radiated from above and echoed from the high mossy walls.

No - not again! Chris shouted.

Caitlin and I exchanged glances, both jumping to the same conclusion.

The three of us rushed back to the dirt slope wed come down on, trying to climb back up one at a time - but the drizzle was quickly turning the slope to muddy mush, and our attempts to escape only made it crumble further.

Chris looked at me with accusation. Were stuck!

I shook my head. Well just have to walk out. This has to lead to the river eventually, right?

Yeah, he replied, his voice rising to a trembling shout. Past the *thing!*

What thing? Caitlin asked, unhappy with being covered in mud, but otherwise unperturbed.

Whatever thing *he* found, whatevers out there all blue and glowy, he complained. We should just sit here and wait for someone to come.

What if it gets dark first? I asked, giving a test shout up at the walls. My own voice echoed back weakly. Theyll never hear us anyway!

We had no choice. Sticking close together, we crept forward along old mossy rock. The high wall against my hand made me feel slightly safer meanwhile, the rain intensified, adding wet autumn chill to the gorges naturally chilly air and the creeks spraying mist. My hands grew numb despite my best attempts to warm them, and we all began shivering soon after.

This is the worst thing thats ever happened, ever, Chris muttered.

I gave no response, too wary of the gorge ahead. Thick accumulations of leaves carpeted whatever ground the swelled creek didnt cover. Ancient trees towered right up out of the gorge itself - none climbable, but all blocking the scant grey sunlight filtering through the rainclouds. Dark, freezing, possibly haunted - yeah, Chris was right, this was the worst thing ever.

I was loving it.

*Hello!?* Chris screamed upward. I followed his eager gaze - we could see the back of a house, sitting on a sharp slope near the edge of the gorge. A ramshackle wooden fence seemed scant protection against falling immediately out the back door to ones death. 

We shouted for a few minutes, but there was no response. Chris went for one last shout at the top of his lungs - and froze. A faint call, a *hello*, perhaps barely perceptible, it came from further down the gorge.

Chris took four eager running steps forward - and froze again. Right, *we* know how this works.

I was as hesitant as he was, but Caitlin moved ahead. We have no choice, she said flatly, shivering against the freezing drizzle.

We moved with caution, trying to scout every possible hiding location, but the tangled undergrowth, huge trees, and rushing creek made total certainty impossible. She held onto my shoulder and alternated walking with her eyes closed, just in case, but she saw nothing.

The rain surged, and it became very difficult to see in the misty gloom.

Hello? came a distant call, barely audible over the loud roar of the rain. Something sounded off about that voice

We came to an abrupt wall of darkness. Peering at it in dismay, we realized that the thickening trees and narrowing gorge had combined to plunge the area ahead into total blackness.

Chris had an expression of regret and fear that I agreed with wholeheartedly, but there was nothing else to do but go through.

Hold on, and dont let go, no matter what, I said, taking the lead.

Thunder rumbled overhead as we moved into the darkness. I could hear the creek burbling and flowing to my left, and I could feel the mossy rock to my right, chilly to the touch the rain roaring above, sometimes dripping on us in thick streams funneled by leaves

*Hello?*

The voice was much clearer, and had a quick echo behind it, as if whoever had shouted was near the opposite wall of the gorge, in the darkness with us

Is it someone else? Chris whispered. Im gonna -

I squeezed his arm painfully to keep him quiet - and Caitlins hand squeezed painfully against my shoulder. I looked over.

At some indeterminate distance in the pitch black, a little blue orb seemed to coalesce. It was an eerie blue, the kind Id seen the night before, and never elsewhere - the kind I would not see again until years later, when an innovative type of LED Christmas light would come out, with new hues that seemed otherworldly to the eye

Howdy! the voice came again, and the little blue orb rotated. Another orb came into view, this one purple and negative, as if it was some kind of anti-light, painful to behold

They were some sort of *eyes*!

Dim otherworldly blue and purple floated across the wall of the gorge as those eyes searched, ever so faintly illuminating whatever they looked at.

We ducked in unison, hiding behind a large boulder as the bizarre light passed over our spot.

Hey, come check this out, the voice called. The dissonance was intense - the voice sounded like an average young male, possibly a female, it was hard to tell but it *sounded* human

The thing began to move, searching further. From the faint light of its eyes, I guessed that it was six or seven feet in height.

We slowly circled the rock as it passed - and then bolted further into the black, scrambling and falling and running. The idea was implicit. The dark area had to widen soon, had to reach the river sometime, we just had to get there

We froze together.

Hello? Howdy. Hey, come check this out! Spare a dime? Hello?

A dozen voices sounded in the darkness ahead. We watched a rapid series of eerie blue and anti-purple eyes open in random places, all leering about, searching for us. Their combined light was just enough to see vague outlines

Faintly opaque shadows flowed from beneath their impossible eyes, each vaguely human, ranging from three to five feet tall. The gorge flashed with a dim menagerie of color, the display moving closer to us by the moment.

Hello?

It was the first voice, from behind us - coming back our way!

Crouching in the darkness, numb, freezing, miserable, and terrified, it was the perfect time to panic. The only choice was whether we should run back, trying to get past the largest one - or forward, into the darkness, past the dozen smaller ones

I grabbed and ran back, pulling Caitlin along, but Chris darted the other way, tearing out of my grasp as he bolted forward.

There was no time. Splashing straight up the slippery creek, stumbling and pressing forward, I received a dozen scrapes and bruises - but Hello? kept calling from behind us, seemingly a little closer each time, even as we ran at full speed.

The rain had become a torrential downpour by the time we reached the mud-slope and the base of the shelf waterfall. We tried to climb up, but spilling water made it impossible, and our hands were numb, besides. Rolling thunder mocked our shouts for help.

Thinking quickly, Caitlin used the water to scrape the mud away with her hand, exposing sharp rocks and more of the roots. Able to grip them at the cost of cuts and scrapes, we worked our way up, constantly looking back for the strange eyes and the parroted human calls but we seemed to have lost it.

That climb was far more dangerous than the climb down, and I thought that I might fall and break bones at any time but we made it.

We ran along the edge, staying well away for fear the rain would sweep us over, or that loose rock might collapse. We could have gone the other way, running for home, but Chris was still down there

We passed over the dark area. From this angle, it seemed wholly unnatural. The dim rain-filtered light seemed to just *stop* somewhere in the air below.

She screamed down periodically as we ran. Chris!

We left the unnatural dark area behind, following the canyon as it widened. We could see the river in the distance.

Right here, guys! we heard Chris yell, from halfway up the gorge wall.

Caitlin ran for the sound of his voice - and abruptly choked on her jacket as I pulled her hood with all my might.

Dangling over a sudden cleft that dropped away to sharp rocks, she flailed her arms. She carefully angled her feet in the slippery mud and pushed back, recovering with my help. Stunned, she backed away - this was almost the same fate wed escaped once before.

Right here, guys! the Chris-voice yelled again. Right here, guys!

Her jaw trembling, she leaned over and looked. I peered over, too. At first, we saw nothing but a few moments passed, and the thing must have realized the deception had failed. Blue and purple lights appeared, gazing up at us for a moment and then a vague, shadowy, huge form moved away.

Caitlin gagged. The thing was dragging a brutally bloodied mess of flesh

I shook her arm. Its a deer, I whispered. Peering through the driving rain, I could just see Chris blue jacket in the distance, stomping through water at the mouth of the gorge and waving his arms frantically at someone.

Hed made it.

Go get him, I told her. Make sure hes alright.

Confused, she argued for a moment, but then did as I asked.

I headed back down the edge of the gorge alone, finding the inexplicable dark zone. Lying on my stomach in the mud, I crept up and peered over the edge. Just like the ghost-thing from the house, I had to look back. I *had to know.*

Illuminated by faint ghastly eyelight, I watched the dozen smaller forms throw pieces of the deer about, noisily fighting and consuming bits of it with glee. My gaze traveled past them as I realized that I was being watched in turn the largest form sat by itself, its blue and purple eyes on me. Without looking away from me, it tore a leg from the deer carcass and threw it to the others.

A minute later, the darkness seemed to swirl, mixing about like a fog. The entire area of blackness cleared between blinks, and I found myself staring down at trees, leaves, and water - natural gorge, indistinguishable from anywhere else on our path, if not for the deer bones. Lying stark white and picked clean, they were scattered about with abandon, some shattered for their marrow

Lying in the mud, rain running down my face, struggling to comprehend everything that had just happened I had the strangest notion Id just witnessed a family rest stop.

	<TITLE> The House Beyond The Edge </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-03 21:48:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ive received more than a few questions about how I got into writing horror, and Ive realized that, perhaps, the best answer is also a story itself.

I had quite a few run-ins with the inexplicable when I was younger. I always loved scary stories, and ate up any horror show I was allowed to watch. This later translated into a subtle disappointment and a feeling of betrayal, as I reached my teenage years without personally ever seeing anything terrifying.

That changed when we moved.

Wed always lived on the east coast, near the Appalachian Mountains. The mountains were blue on the horizon, and the land was hilly and massively forested. I grew up completely used to wandering in the woods. It was all moderately civilized landscape; that was simply the nature of cities in the foothills.

The Midwest was completely the opposite. The American Midwest, at least around here, could probably be characterized best as a dichotomy. Suburbs were built in tight formation, with landscaped lawns and pretty streets. Meanwhile, right outside the outer circle of houses - drawn around the area almost like a wagon train circled for safety - there immediately began completely unkempt forest.

In our neighborhood, we called that abrupt back end to our neighborhood *the Edge*. Around the age of fourteen, we fancied ourselves far too old be scared of anything - but that sudden divide between trimmed civilization and dark forest still fascinated and terrified us.

There was a house back there, too, a mile or two back. Left over from some past era, it was well known in the neighborhood as haunted. Besides a purported aura of intense fear it gave off, its primary claim to fame was a strange sound that could only be heard while inside.

We resolved to enter that house and figure out, once and for all, the mystery of that sound.

It was seventh grade, and I, having just moved, was in a new school that I hated. My only friends were the other outcasts. There was Hans, the German kid who spoke English with a thick accent; Chris, who was permanently sarcastic and annoying; and our token weird girl, Caitlin, who - according to rumor - picked her nose often and once, *ate it.* Misfits was an apt term for our group.

And then there was me: too smart for my own good, just cool enough to know how cool I wasnt, and more than a little angry at life in general. I was every teenager ever, now that I think about it.

We crept across the Edge in the middle of the afternoon - we werent stupid enough to try it at night. Compared to my old home, the forest itself was different, too. Instead of massive old-growth trees with plenty of space underneath and a nice carpet of leaves, this forest was more moderate in height, and much more tangled. This was not something a person could just walk around in.

Worse, the middle of Ohio was rife with sudden sheer canyons for some ancient geological reason. Our parents had often regaled us with tales of the kids who fell in and died; one or two a year, if their exaggerations were to be believed.

So, we crept through the tangled underbrush with double apprehension. Passage was annoying enough that, once we reached the house, we could have given ourselves excuses and went home but we didnt. This was, potentially, our ticket to some measure of popularity.

The house sat at an odd angle, surrounded by slightly younger trees and thick undergrowth. Four holly trees flanked the front, two on each side of the main steps. The porch looked disturbingly like a mouth, and the front door sat ajar. We looked at each other for several minutes, daring one another be the first - until a sudden drizzle forced our collective hand.

We sought the porch for shelter from the surprise rain.

Yeah, that makes this way less scary, Chris commented, gazing up at the wall of rain sliding down from the houses roof.

The patter of rain on leaves reminded me of home - but the accompanying gloom made the house that much darker. I peered in through the dusty front windows, but saw nothing.

Caitlin peered in another window, apprehensive. Boys first

Hans just frowned, and pushed the front door. Surprisingly, it swung in without resistance or sound.

The interior of the house sat like two dark planes above and below a dim haze of dust. The rain outside had the whole place pattering, creaking, and breathing.

I was rather eloquent back then. *This sucks*

Nobody argued the point. We crept in at a snails pace, testing each placed foot as if something might leap out at us at any moment. Once all four of us were inside, Hans let the door swing silently shut, and we froze, listening.

The ebb and flow of the rain blanketed us with a current of sound we heard a creak upstairs and then came a creak near the dust-covered sofa in the room to our left riding adrenaline, it almost seemed a good idea to bolt.

Before we made the collective decision to leave there it was.

Its like being at the movies, Caitlin whispered. And the theater next to yours starts rumbling and shaking

Her description was the best way to put it. The house vibrated slightly, and a spike in the rumbling actually shook dust from the rafters above.

Shaking my head to get the dust out of my hair, I crept forward, following the rumble. The sound brought me to a gaping black door. Of *course* the basement

Unhappily, we clustered around the stairs to the basement. Deeper gloom lit the base of the stairs, filtering through from the small basement windows wed seen from outside.

After you, Chris said.

Making a face, I stepped carefully down, testing each wooden board. The structure itself seemed solid, even if I couldnt see it; I kept calm by telling myself they could see my silhouette against the basements dim light, and would get help if they saw me fall

I froze at the base of the stairs.

The rumbling was louder here, like distant thunder. I could feel a subtle vibration in my legs whenever the rolling murmur reached a crescendo. I noticed all that, subconsciously, but it was what I *saw* that had me locked in place.

Filtering swaths of dusty light fell through countless sharp objects.

Three pitchforks over there old harvesting equipment with a roll of curved spines across from it a goddamn bear trap on the wall rusty shovels hung machetes every piece of ancient farm equipment imaginable lay around at unpredictable angles.

A hand grabbed my shoulder.

Hows it look? Chris asked, hunched over against the cobwebs wed passed through. He looked around. Oh schnikey

He jumped as Caitlin bumped into him, and Hans came up behind her.

This looks dangerous, Caitlin said.

I agreed but I hated it here, in this city, the whole place I wasnt about to let some creepy house scare me off, especially not when the danger was completely mundane - as always. I *wanted* to be scared, *wanted* to run from a ghost, and I'd always been let down.

Well just be careful, I said, moving forward. The sounds closer here. Nobodys ever said anything about this basement, so we know were further than theyve ever been.

Lets leave, take this discovery, its already good for us, Hans said, concerned.

I looked back at him with a glare and shook my head, before moving forward again.

Caitlin moved past Chris and held onto my shoulder as I moved. It sounds like the ocean

Yeah, it does I replied, wondering if that was significant. I carefully slid around a jagged series of tools that had fallen from a rotting shelf. But that whole aura of fear thing the other kids talk about, theres none of that. Just this basement full of rusted crap

Working their own way through the expansive gloomy maze of rusty danger, Hans and Chris followed the other side of the room, and then cut through the middle. Eventually, we all made it to the end of the basement, where the sound became quite loud.

Wait, Hans said, holding up a hand. He pulled a bar from something on a nearby post, and poked out at the floor.

It fell away suddenly, a three or four foot gap appearing in the crumbling dirt and rock. The gap had been there already, just slightly less wide - and invisible in the darkness. Now, with the edge crumbling away, we could barely see rain-filtered light down below, and little gushing rivulets of rainwater working their way down what looked like a hundred-foot spillway.

Its a cut-through, to the gorge, I realized aloud, running through the nearby areas layout in my head. Thats the sound - were hearing the river!

You think that kid that died fell into the river from here? Chris asked, snickering.

I stared down the hole from as close as I dared. Uneven, lined with boulders and steep drops, the sheer spillway seemed horribly lethal. Yeah, man he might have. Died in the fall, and then washed fully out by rain sometime later

Chris fell silent at that prospect.

Caitlin gripped my shoulder tighter. Lets go guys, weve done it, lets get out of here.

I stood tall to say something and a sudden rush of fear hit me. My heart began pounding faster, and I felt a call to action, as if I was immediately threatened. Caitlins grip on my shoulder became sharp and painful.

What is that? Hans asked, his voice shaking.

I wasnt scared of anything - thered been no prompt, no scary sight, no scary sound - and I knew what it was - it was the aura of fear the other kids swore was real. Struggling not to run for fear of the basements maze of rusted blades and points, I held the others back and peered through the dim haze.

You guys see anything? I asked, my breathing strained. The fear just kept rising, sharper and sharper, nearing panic

No, Chris responded, terrified.

My body kept screaming at me that *something was about to get me*, that *something was approaching*, but I still saw nothing

Underneath the flood of fear, I felt a strange moment of excitement. This was what Id wanted. Id *wanted* to be afraid. Feeling contrary and eager, I closed my eyes, letting the fear surge exponentially. I even smiled for a moment

I opened my eyes, confused.

I closed my eyes again - it was there again.

I opened my eyes. It was gone again.

I closed my eyes, now certain I was seeing the source of the inexplicable fear. I couldnt explain it - but I could only see it while my eyes were closed. Against the total blackness of my own eyelids, a horrible vision approached.

It could only be described as a silhouette of monochrome spectral lines, flickering grey against black. Its outline in constant motion, it seemed to flash and jump in place. Clad in ethereal torn clothes and covered in gaping wounds - neck bones jutting from below a head permanently tilted against its shoulder - the corpse-image took slow, shambling steps forward.

I opened my eyes, and I couldnt see it anymore. By my best guess, it was halfway across the basement, and moving toward us.

Jesus Christ, close your eyes, I whispered.

No! the other three kids shouted in unison.

Do it! I shouted back.

They did, and I could see their strained control failing. The inexplicable fear had already been almost too much, but once they saw the thing coming for us

We have to go, I said, feeling out of my own head. It was finally happening - Id finally seen the supernatural, felt it - and the fear seemed to eliminate every other emotion. All I had left was a hammering heart and logic. Its going to push us in the hole.

That threat brought my friends back to clarity for a moment.

Go that way, I said, ordering Chris and Hans to take the other side of the rusted maze.

Tears sliding down his face, Hans nodded, and the two of them went left. I took Caitlin and went right.

Moving too fast, I almost ran bodily into the curled spines Id seen earlier. Slowly, not daring to breathe, I stepped back. Closing my eyes, I looked for the flickering entity - and it was almost upon us, blocking our way forward.

Back the other way at a dangerous pace, I tried the middle path. Caitlin, wheres it going?

She didnt want to close her eyes.

Look! Please look!

As we inched forward, narrowly avoiding a series of hanging blades, she clung hard to my back and moved her head around. Its close to Chris and -

I heard Hans cry out in pain, but I couldnt look - my eyes were on the bear trap hanging against the wall as we smoothly and slowly moved by it. If it snapped shut from the humidity or our motion or anything - her head cleared the danger area, and she never realized what Id moved her past

Its coming back this way! she shouted in my ear.

Closing my eyes for a look, I saw it reaching out for me, and I ducked, crawling forward and dragging Caitlin behind me. Covered in dirt, I reached the stairs, just in time to pull Chris forcibly by the back of his shirt and keep him from falling onto an upright pitchfork.

They ran up the stairs, while I paused to close my eyes and look back.

The thing leered at me from the middle of the basement, its sideways grin mocking me, as if to say *"You think youve gotten away"*

I ran then, too.

Hans had cut his arm, but, other than that, we escaped unscathed. Our discovery led to a fundraiser by the neighborhood association, and the house was torn down, and the hole filled in, the next year. We did win a certain amount of notoriety among the other kids for all that, which led to later explorations and even worse locations, but those are their own stories.

Although I never told my friends what Id seen in that last glance back. It was also the genesis of my interest in writing horror. Theres more to this world than randomness and unfounded fears in the dark - if I hadnt been a perverse fear-seeker in that moment and closed my eyes, I might not be here today. I think its important we honor the eons-old tradition of sharing scary stories, because there are kernels of truth in these stories, and the strategies within might one day help someone escape from a horrible fate. 

Because, as that mocking glance told me, that ghastly *thing* had a will a mind and it was *intelligent*. I saw the elegance of the strategy, in that moment: it made people afraid on purpose.

Afraid people look around - they keep their eyes wide - and they *dont* close them

Remember that, next time you feel afraid of the dark for no reason. Your instinct to look around, your instinct to stare at the darkness in fear, may be exactly what *something* is counting on

Theres a certain allure in the chase; an enjoyment of the game itself. Win or lose, youre still playing, still making move and countermove, full of energy and action. Throughout, theres a sense of importance that no other activity can really match. The game is the game but now its over, and, Ill admit, Ill miss the feeling.

Although having the horrible truth - possessing it and holding it close like a prized treasure - the truth can almost replace that feeling.

I won.

I felt that I was on the path to victory once I calmed down from my delusion about the patients escaping. I realized that I had quite a few cards in my hand to be played. My unknown opponent had made a mistake somewhere, and allowed me far too many leads.

The first: the girl I helped escape during my delusion was nowhere to be found. Her room was empty, and her file was deleted. None of the other staff could remember her, and I believed some of them. An old nurse like Mabel would not possibly be part of a conspiracy so dark and vast. Her primary concern was the next episode of her soaps

But I wrote about the girl. I have the words on my computer, and on the internet. I told no one here that Ive been writing about patients - I would immediately be fired, for obvious reasons.

I have the words, and I remember. 

Memories are tricky, as I know personally, but the words are still there. Furthermore, I went through the patients one by one, looking for discrepancies. I could have just helped the girl escape while having an episode; that proved nothing but while so deluded, I saw one patient carve up another, even had his *lung* slide up against my shoe.

The murdered patient was missing, too.

At that point, I had a few logical choices to consider about my opponent.

A strong - but imperfect - case could have been made that, somewhere in the maze of owners and financial backers and stockholders behind this place, some nefarious corporation had an agenda involving the patients and their various insanities. The likeliest intent was to incubate and refine memetic hazards; ideas carefully constructed to infect anyone who heard them, carefully constructed to spread and destroy. This would be a new kind of weapon, perhaps changing warfare forever.

Their primary agent would have been the chief of medicine, and much of my paranoia, delusions, and inconsistencies could have been explained by drugs in my pain killers, meant to imbalance me and discredit me should I uncover their agenda.

The foremost problem with that theory is the lack of recall on the part of the staff. Perhaps some were lying, perhaps Mabel just rarely interacted with the girl, perhaps some didnt care enough to remember individual patients but all of them? It felt wrong.

While an uncharacteristic downpour on the roof filled the building with the constant rhythm of heavy rain, I stalked the halls, eyeing everything. I asked the responsive patients if they remembered the girl - and they did. The only people that could remember her were patients, and me. That struck me as extremely important

No, the corporation angle didnt add up.

The booming thunder outside added to my tension. There were other explanations.

I could have been a patient myself. The signs were not lost on me. Claire had been employed here, and I suspected the chief of medicine had some idea she was off balance - but her particular brand of insanity was harmless for most people. My bandaged hand had begun itching painfully some time that morning, and it added an undercurrent of increasing anger to my strategizing.

Id dwelled often on the nature of memory and insanity. I had nothing to prove that I was not, myself, some sort of employed patient with a carefully crafted delusion of a normal life beyond the walls of the establishment. The sun did feel ages distant, but the rising storm outside made even that luxury impossible.

All the specific memories I could recall had no basis other than whatever sanctity I granted them. I asked myself if it mattered I asked myself where that logic would lead

It would lead backwards, to the conditions that created this situation. Someone like Claire, someone like me - potentially - employed to watch over the other patients that meant critical underfunding, so much so that moral and ethical lines had long since been redrawn - or erased. It meant a world filling up with people, a world struggling for resources a dark, dreary, and painful reality for the human race.

That was a situation with no enemy, and thus no victory. Humanity would suffer increasingly as the population rose, and only some great disaster or rupturing of morals would offer any salvation.

Adding to the strength of that theory was the story of every patient here. The pressures and brutalities of society had pushed them all in this direction - perhaps it was society itself that was insane, and these poor men and women were merely the most unfortunate victims of that derangement.

That notion felt right - but my being insane required a crumbling society, while, reversed, the existence of a crumbling society did not necessarily mean I was insane.

These tracks had consumed my investigation, but I had been given a third option by the last patient I interviewed. His was a tale of deception and control, and it profoundly disturbed me. Id been interrupted writing it up, but the more I thought about it the more the pieces seemed to fit.

A sudden spike in the intensity of the rain reminded me of something and then it hit me.

Id read his story before.

Id read it on the internet.

His file was missing from here had someone else read it and put it up? Or had he done it, before his admission here? The details would have been lost to time, so I decided not to pursue them. It was the greater framework that was important.

I began to entertain an expanded notion of reality, hypothetically. If the bonewalker had been real, it had been fighting some *worse* force on a grand scale.

Was that force also my opponent now? What was its concern with me, with this building and its patients? I had seen absolutely no indication of any outside force

I remember stiffening, then. I stood in the hall, next to a window spreading rain-dappled shadow patterns on the floor, knowing implicitly that I had hit upon the first iota of the truth.

Evidence *was* the deception! It had me delving in every direction except the right one.

Unable to fully comprehend the massive idea building in my head, I made for the blind girls room. I found her sitting in a different corner than before, but still writing. As I entered the room, my bandaged hand began to itch distractingly, and my headache returned.

Why wont you talk to me? I asked her. I thought before that it might be because Im crazy, like them, and dont know it but now I think you know whats going on, and youre protecting yourself.

Poised against paper, her pen stilled. How are you asking that question?"

What do you mean? Should I not be able to ask questions?

Not that one

I moved down on one knee, nearer her. Why?

She glared at me with unseeing eyes.

I widened my own eyes. You dont talk to anyone who

Suddenly extremely uneasy, I raised my hands to my own temples. Gently feeling the skin near my eyes, I searched for any aberration the sensation was disconcerting. Beneath my burning hand and increasingly sharp headache, I felt two conflicting results.

My temples were smooth. The skin was soft and normal.

My temples bore two strange, subtle, and irregular raised lines, like rough veins gone awry

What the hell is it? I breathed, wincing from a blast of pain in my head. Its there, and not there

Im sorry she whispered.

*What is it? What the hell is it?* I forced out, my face screwed up from continually rising pain that approached a crescendo that threatened to knock me unconscious. I struggled to breathe, even as little blurs and flickers appeared in my vision. How many have this?

Her lip trembled in response to my sounds of pain.  everybody except the other patients

Surging with adrenaline and will, I stumbled from her room, running for the emergency operation room. I pushed the door in forcefully, almost falling from the pain, and rushed for the tools.

Facing the mirror, I fought the blinding pain and blurry vision to see - I could see it - the little ridges were plainly visible, running from my eyes, across my temples, and around the back of my head like some horrible lobotomy line

I pricked my temple with a scalpel. Blood welled out, but I ignored it, instead carefully prying at the ridge with a gripping tool.

My vision flashed white and black.

I did not relent. I pulled at the foreign tissue underneath I screamed in agony, but refused to pass out slowly, so painfully slowly, I pulled out a long, stringy fiber. Hanging from my bleeding temple, gripped in my tool, I knew that this was it. This was part of it. Id considered the impossible and Id been right.

The pain immediately lessened as I cut the fibrous tissue as close to my skin as I could. There was still some inside, near my eyes, and all the fiber on the other side of my head but this was a start. Holding it up, I tried to comprehend what I was seeing.

It looked like nerve tissue - stringy, webbed, made of tiny little fibers and thats what the blind girl had said when she was first admitted. Shed said she wouldnt talk to anyone with nerve fibers in their temples

but shed been here for years

 I repeated the same procedure on the other side. My headache was still barely there, but I felt vindicated and relieved.

Was that it? Was I free? And what the hell were these nerve fibers? Some sort of infection, or parasite? By themselves, these fibers couldnt possibly have controlled or deceived me there simply wasnt enough tissue for complex interaction with the brain in fact, the fibers looked like they were from an optic nerve. It was sensory tissue, designed to fool the senses?

That made a sick sort of sense. Connected to my eyes and ears and probably my brain, directly through my optic nerve these fibers could completely deceive my senses, perhaps even my memories. Shed said I shouldnt have been able to ask that question how much control did these fibers normally exert?

And why was I now able to detect them, even remove them?

Ill be honest, I felt like breaking down and crying then, both at my sudden freedom and vindication, and at the implied utter domination Id lived under for so long - possibly years. I probably would have broken down, if I did not have some terrible notion that these fibers received signals or control from elsewhere.

The opponent

After cleaning up my blood, I took a quick and surreptitious circle through the halls. Mabel smiled at me, and then turned away - a subtle ridge was evident on the side of her head.

She was infected. I kept walking, kept looking - they all were.

I returned to the safety of the emergency operation room as the pain in my head began rising again. I looked in the mirror, horrified - I could literally see the skin on my temples rising, as the nerve fibers inside began to regenerate.

I remember quite clearly - I laughed out loud, a hearty, dark, full belly laugh. This was too much. Infecting me, growing back even if I cut it out, what the hell was I supposed to do?

My laugh died as my medical knowledge supplied an answer.

Disinfecting my hands and donning gloves, I prepared for something I knew was probably insane - and Id promised myself I wouldnt cross that line when I came to it, but, oh, how foolish Id been then - and I readied several mirrors.

I had no painkillers, because I couldnt risk dulling my amateur surgical ability.

Breathing hard, surging with adrenaline, I placed a separation tool against my eyelids and ratcheted them open. I steeled myself against what I was about to do

My eye slid out more easily than Id expected.

Just an inch or two, just enough to keep the optic nerve at tension frozen with unbelievable discomfort and pain the likes of which Id never imagined, I brought the scalpel up, carefully cutting away at the connected foreign nerve fibers.

Five breaths ten twenty I took as long as I could stand it, carefully severing the connections at their base. My animal mind screamed incessantly in my head - I could *see my own eye out of my head, see a bundle of blood vessels and nerves connecting it!* - but I fought the impulse to panic.

I pulled the rest of the nerve fibers out through the side of my eye socket - they came quite easily, from that direction and then, incredibly, I was done. I carefully took my eye between my gloved fingers and slid it back in.

I took five minutes to calm myself, to test my eye, to let my panic subside and then I did the other eye.

By the time I finished, my headache was gone. The nerve fibers did not regenerate. Id gotten them all.

For an hour, I lay in that room, enjoying my freedom, thinking, breathing, calming

Where did these nerve fibers come from? There was unmistakably a will behind the ongoing deception. Who was it? *What* was it? Deception would not have worked against the bonewalkers slaves - they did not know the reasons behind their actions; they simply followed its orders on threat of death

And the patients were free of the fibers why? The illuminating realization struck me that the reason was quite possibly the same as it might have been for society: containment. The people here were dangerous, and their insanities even more so.

Maybe all the explanations shared a common thread: the world *was* dark and grim, growing overpopulated as my mentor had said, creating increasingly virulent and dangerous insanities on the sheer weight of numbers and probability

And maybe this other force, whatever had infected people with nerve fibers and used deception for some purpose the next step was obvious. I wouldnt want my nerve fibers connected to a brain full of delusion and virulent ideas. I wouldnt want those ideas broadcasting through my network of nerve-fiber-controlled slaves infecting them, ruining them, destroying them and, possibly, freeing them.

I was losing my mind. I knew it, then, quite certainly. The pain killers, the exhaustion, the obsession Id let the other patients' delusions get to me, regarding their ideas as increasingly real, and there I was free. That was why I could now see the nerve fibers, why they constricted around my skull, why they fought me at every step.

It was ironic, really the doctor, becoming the patient; growing insanity, bringing reality

But my stories were on the internet. *His* story, the male patient that had stabbed out his own eyes - *his* story was on the internet. How was it that the Opponent allowed such a thing to happen and spread? Was it the same notion that kept the patients here contained and uncontrolled? Was the *idea itself* anathema to its network of control? It couldnt identify the ideas, couldnt regard them, without understanding them and becoming infected.

I was laughing often, alone in that room, as the logical steps increasingly fell into place.

There is no defense against an idea.

I walked back into the hall a new man. I was free, and there was nothing the Opponent could do. It could no longer regard me, no longer think of me. I *must* not exist to it, because to acknowledge me would be to think of me, and then understand me, and then become infected. I had the black and hilarious notion that the nerve fibers would probably have left me of their own accord at some near point, had I allowed my descent into madness to continue.

What did you *do* to yourself? the chief of medicine shouted, seeing me from down the hall. I heard him call urgently for orderlies, but thunder obscured his first shout.

I ran.

The side doors lock had been fixed - damnit! I used my keys, unlocking each door as I passed, releasing the patients as a distraction. I heard the orderlies shouting and organizing somewhere nearby - I had a sudden idea as I passed the maintenance room. It was easier than Id expected. I flipped the circuit breakers, and all the lights went out.

As I emerged back into the hall, strangely at home in darkness and rotating red emergency light, the only sounds were the rain slamming against the roof, and intermittent thunder.

Strange Id imagined this or not imagined this the night before no, this time there was rain

I grabbed my laptop from the on-call room, slung it over my shoulder in its bag, and ditched my white coat. I stuffed as many snacks from the vending machine in my bag as I could, promising to pay it back someday for the broken glass and cost of what I took.

Screams and grunts filled the shifting darkness. I could hear staff members shouting and trying to find one another. I could hear patients muttering and somebody screamed in pain.

I smiled as I crept through the darkness. The confusion was working perfectly.

Thunder shook the building as I approached the main door. The area was empty, as the orderlies contended with the escaped patients - I was free.

Wait! he called, as I put my hand against the door. I could hear rain slicking the other side. Dont do it!

It was my mentor.

Ive been following your actions as best I could, he explained, concerned. That patient, at the end of the far wing - we keep him back there, attended as little as possible, for a reason. Remember what I said to you?

I stared back at him, ready to bolt through the door, but willing to hear him out.

His psychosis, its infected you! he shouted over the grunts and screams from the back halls. And I *know* you believe insanity is a choice. *Choose* to stay, to remain here, to be part of the staff and real life!

I turned away, ready to leave.

Whats out that door for you? he asked loudly. What are you going to do - run, hide from society, hurt people for whatever reasons youve come to believe?

His reasoning and compassion made sense perfect sense. I hesitated. Was I really that far gone? What if I did accept that reality? Whether some entity was deceiving me or not, life was decent enough, right?

This was the moment. I felt it. Out that door, I was de facto insane, at least compared to whichever reality society bought as true - here, I was one of them, a staff member, accepted, and normal

It made too much sense. It was *too* perfect.

Its *you!* I realized, practically screaming it.

Lit in crimson, he shook his head, confused I didnt expect the Opponent to reveal itself, just because Id figured out that *it* was speaking through my mentor - no, his body's reaction was perfect, deceptively real.

Thunder boomed, and I pushed out into the rain, running for my life.

Life will be a bit harder from now on, Im sure. Im outside the construction of societys reality but *it* cant regard me anymore, cant think of me, without risking itself. I am free to move undetected and ignored, for the most part. I think Ill change my name, get a job, put on a faade of normalcy, and operate from behind a mask - because it must ignore me, so the only people I have to fool are other humans.

It cant stop my ideas, which I release to the world like the virus they are. We are all being deceived, every one of us. I saw the true nature of the world once the rain cleared. I see what has really happened to us.

I was on a hill, outside the city, when the clouds parted, and the blessed sun finally brought long-sought relief. Id seen indications of the truth, as I ran through the rain, but the darkness and water obscured the extent

I stood and looked down on the city.

Growths hung high up, between buildings, street lamps, and trees - thick, ropey fibers - nerve fibers. It infested most everything, wrapped around the trappings of civilization like a strangling vine. I had a flash of understanding then - this thing, this infestation, stretching the world over most certainly

Nerves, neurons, brains, interconnected, deceived, a similar network to the internet itself the entity may have begun as just an idea, a meme, or a mutation somewhere, and spread from there and now it was a massive parasite on humanity. I could feel its past influence on me, now that it was gone, and I understood what it wanted.

More.

It wants more people, more brains, more stress, more consumption. It *loves* caffeine. It loves stimulants of any kind, but caffeine especially. It wants you to drink more. It wants you to eat more. It wants you to consume and reproduce, as it guides the human race toward some dark and unknown goal while the pressures it creates, humanitys own needs sharpened to the extreme, crush whole swaths of people underfoot.

Whether it be body image, or the desperation of being poor or on the street, or financial slavery to massive debt, or the need for affection, or - in my case - the basic desire to believe that suffering is not the normal fundamental nature of life whatever your stress, your weakness, it will grind increasing numbers of us up and push us past our limits of will and reason, for it is society, and it is us, and we are *all* expendable.

But today is the first day of the Resistance. I post now from free wireless at a coffee shop, smiling at passersby. The Opponent cannot regard me, and everyone else is consumed in their own private struggle against societys extreme and rising pressures. Theyre all too stressed to notice that someone like me - someone insane, as compared to societys reality - is sitting among them. After this post, Ill disappear even from here, and no one will be the wiser.

But dont worry. This is my lifes work, now. I took my scalpel and tools with me. I will find you, and I will free you all - one pair of eyes at a time.

What is the nature of insanity? As of late, Ive contemplated this question far too deeply. I find myself standing in the hall and thinking of the sun, which I have not seen in many days. Ive been spending all my time reading files and financial documents. I cant determine where the back-end mess of shell companies and legal fictions lead. The controlling interest in this place cannot be precisely located - but that might just be a sign of the times.

If I were to step outside and enjoy the healing radiance of the sun, perhaps purposely walk in the chilly winter breezes without a jacket just to feel the air wash over me, how would I know that the experience was real once I returned inside? The only proof any of us have that the rest our life exists are memories.

If you cant trust your memories, what *can* you trust? It seems curiously relevant to me that ones entire structure of reality comes down to a series of mutable mental factoids.

Perhaps that is what happened to these people. They are not fundamentally broken on an organic level. They are all there, all functioning, all thinking but, through a series of decisions, their reality became quite dark and painful.

Except for one one story doesnt fit.

After finishing my other duties, I went straight to him.

I used my practiced calm, but stern tone. You left something out.

He sighed and looked over at me, saying nothing. The despair in his eyes was heartbreaking.

I read your account, in your file, I continued, making sure to impart compassion and urgency. Theres something missing from your story.

His brow lowered slightly. How did you know?

I thought of the pattern the rest of the patients followed, and how his didnt fit. Its not important. Im here because I care, and I think something bigger than both of us is going on. I need to know the rest of your story.

His face scrunched up; I thought he was smiling but then he sobbed, and tears flowed down his cheeks. You believe me? God, please tell me you believe me.

I was well aware of my mentors - and even the chief of medicines - warnings about how I regarded the patients ideas but I needed to know. Yes, I believe you.

He sobbed more deeply, and curled over in profound relief. Ill tell you, Ill tell you

---

I lied about how it happened. I wasnt just walking on the street. What, some random bum spills blood on me, and then the bonewalker comes out of nowhere? No, it was me.

I sought it out.

My life was already taking a dark turn. I was nobody. Ignored by everyone. I was just some guy, no college degree, nothing to his name, no family to speak of and no connections. I felt left behind by the whole world. People were constantly afraid of me, unwilling to give me a job, just because I had a record... don't think I didn't notice when other people held themselves closer at night as I walked by...

Addicted to middling drugs, not the real killer stuff mind you, not yet, I often moved among the citys underbelly, the only place that would have me. Theres drugs, yeah brutality, too, anything you want orgies, even, but you dont want a part of that, believe me.

Those people they had a desperation about them. It was in the air, and everyone knew it, and it seemed like nothing mattered to many of them

The bonewalker was a whispered rumor among them. There were some users that didnt need to work, didnt need to put on the faade of a normal life. They had a *backer.* Lucky bastards, we called them.

Every hopeless pariah eventually gets to this point where the initial money, the initial will, the initial life - thats all gone. I hit that point, and I turned to that thing. It wasnt for the drugs, either. In fact, I cleaned up quite a bit. It was the *power*.

People *answered to me*. Screw with me, you die. All I have to do is get some of that special blood on your fingernails or teeth, and my backer cuts you up from the inside out. It liked to do that, you know. It treated us like pets. The money was great, too. I hated being sliced up every time it came calling, yeah, but that was the cost of doing business.

Then things got more serious, and I realized I was more a slave than a pet. Some of the things it forced me to do were God, I have nightmares at first, I didnt understand the greater picture.

We'd all gotten in over our heads because there was nobody else to turn to. Once you have a record, once you're on the street, it's over for you... and the bonewalker took advantage of that. It had more than enough willing recruits to create a network, an army. It took a lot of whispered conversations with other slaves to figure out that we were part of something far more disturbing than just our own private hells... and our master wasn't the worst thing out there. We were the *good guys*, fighting the *good fight* by any means necessary, can you imagine that? It just wasn't good for us personally, because both society and the bonewalker viewed us as expendable...

You know why Im in this bed? Why Im so depressed? Think about it. If I was afraid of dying at any moment, Id *live it up.* I wouldnt sit here, in this room, alone no, just the opposite. The bonewalkers *dead,* man. Its not coming back. That *idiot* killed it!

I imagined doing it that way, sometimes, crushing it up in a pile of treated bones so it wouldnt know which way was out, so it would get torn up as the bones shatter great minds think alike, right? But when I figured out what was really going on I was *glad* for -

---

What? I asked, interrupting. *Whats going on?*

You mean, you dont? He froze, staring at me with trembling eyes. His pupils drifted left in slow motion, full of dismay and apprehension. Ive said too much, Im sorry.

He resumed staring at the wall, ignoring my further attempts to prompt him.

At first, I was angry that he didnt just *tell me* what was going on but, then, I thought better of it. For a moment there, Id actually believed him. Id let his story become real to me. I was taking too many risks with my own mind.

No, the bonewalker could not be real his addiction was, though. The underbelly, the criminal acts, all of it, that was the kernel of truth I would take from his story. A hinted-at larger picture, an air of desperation

 and bad choices.

He fit the pattern now.

Standing in that hallway, I couldnt help but stare down one wall and back up the other. Every single door imprisoned a patient who had *chosen* their way into madness and despair. Their own needs, taken to the extreme, had ruined them all. I didnt know what it meant, not yet, but it was a major red flag.

Actually I walked to the end of the hall, nodded at Mabel as she passed - no harm done from yesterdays temporary drugging, thankfully - and I halted outside of one door I hadnt tried.

I watched her through the square glass aperture. Allowed a pen and paper due to her non-violence, she often wrote at great length. Curled up in the corner, she wrote even now. She was one of the few patients who I had no story for, no testimony.

For politeness sake, I knocked.

Come in, she called.

She continued writing as I entered.

Hi, I began. Im -

You know the drill, she responded, continuing to write.

I hesitated. Can you put the pen down?

 Ive never hurt anyone. Im not about to start.

Accepting her statement, but still apprehensive, I kneeled down. She reached both hands up and felt around my temples, and then back around the curve of my head.

Sorry, she breathed, with a note of disappointment. I cant talk to you.

Are you sure? I want to help. I think something is going on here, in this place.

She made no response, turning back to her scribbling.

Can I at least see what youre writing?

She ignored me.

Picking up the papers, I looked at a few. They were not gibberish, not exactly, but filled with stream of consciousness paragraphs in carefully practiced script with a few strange errors.

I waved my hand in front of her face, and she still made no reaction. My jaw dropped. Are you blind?

She took in a sharp breath through her nose, but still made no reply.

Ok, ignore me, I told her. But at least tell me why youre writing all this, if you cant read it? What is this all for?

She gave me only a single word. Practice.

Her answer was simple, but profound. I left her to her devices, contemplating her possible backstory. If she knew how to write, and she was practicing it, that meant she was able to see at one time she had not always been blind. What could that tell me? Had she, too, somehow gone from a normal girl to a quiet, blinded patient who refused to talk to anyone who didnt pass her inexplicable ritual?

It seemed very unfair, at that moment, that normal life could derail so badly. All of these people - they were all normal, more or less, and made enough bad choices to end up here.

There was another blind patient without a backstory. Oddly, hed had one at some point, but the file was destroyed or lost. I passed through several sets of doors, heading for the farthest wing. They kept him at the very end.

I peered in at him. Hed stabbed out his own eyes with a pen long ago. He sat in the far left corner of his cell, his eyes closed, but his position indicated that he was awake. I couldnt imagine his level of boredom - he refused anything electronic, became quite violent around such devices, in fact. A television, or even just a radio, might have alleviated his unending darkness and solitude I honestly couldnt fathom spending every day just sitting and thinking, trapped in my own head.

I saw a tiny bit of white sticking out from under his leg.

I rushed through the halls, filled with a sudden hunch. Mabel!

She stopped and turned. Thanks for yesterday, she said. My husband would be lost if anything happened to me. Tottering old fool. She smiled.

Sure thing, I almost said, but hesitated, remembering how that twisted limbless man and I had both said the same thing to Claire. The words held a shuddering aversion for me now. Um, youre welcome. Mabel, are you or do you know of any nurses, who are bringing papers from one patient to another?

Hows your hand? she asked, suddenly nervous.

I looked down at the bandage. Fine. But about those papers.

She donned a frustrated expression. They seem to like writing to each other. He was just, sitting there alone. I felt sorry for him. I didnt mean any harm.

Its fine, I told her. Im not looking to get you in trouble. Do you happen to know anything about *what* theyre writing?

She explained some of the minor details shed read, just to check - she wasnt about to pass death threats or other rudeness, she said - and, once I understood, I hurried back to the end of the far wing.

I can hear you, he called through the door.

Frowning, I watched him subtly adjust to hide the papers he was sitting on. I entered after a moment, letting him think I didnt know. I wondered how he read them at all - until I realized that he could probably feel the pens effect on the paper, like an engraving. Interesting I stood halfway into the room, giving him some space.

Although blind, he made an effort to look in my direction. Youre not like the rest of them, you know.

What do you mean?

He frowned, and then gave a weak smile. You dont walk like them.

He was right. Id been walking quickly, with energy and concern. The other staff took their leisurely time in the halls - it was just a job, to them. It had become more than that to me.

Are you willing to tell me your story? I asked, sitting cross-legged near him.

His smile widened into a mocking grin. Its pointless.

Tell me anyway.

Do you have a cellphone? he asked.

I shook my head, but then realized he couldnt see the motion. No - it could interfere with medical equipment.

A pager?

I looked at my belt. No, I lied.

Good, good he mused aloud. Been having headaches lately, *friend?*

I blinked. I had, actually. Id been sleeping little, and poorly when I did. The on-call room did not offer the best sleeping conditions, and it had been the center of my extracurricular activities for the duration of my investigation. Id chalked up the headaches to my fatigue, and I'd been downing increasing numbers of painkillers No, no headaches, I lied.

Oh. He seemed vaguely disappointed. I figured that paranoid schizophrenics like him enjoyed guessing little things, because it hinted at some greater mysterious knowledge they might possess - and being wrong was not something he enjoyed.

Fine, he said after a moment. Ive nothing better to do. Then youll leave me alone?

Yes.

Alright but you might not like what you hear.

Good. I have a feeling something is going on, and I already dont like it.

He seemed to perk up at that. Really

---

It was a Sunday. I remember that very clearly. I -

---

I didnt finish writing the days events up before something else happened.

Blackness washed over me like a wave as I sat in the on-call room, typing out the story he told me. By the light of my laptop screen, I checked the mainline phone - no dialtone. The constant droning of the buildings air system was gone, replaced with deathly silence. I crept over to the door and peered into the hallway.

Darkness hovered between rotating red emergency lights, sparsely placed at long intervals.
At the extreme other end of the hall, under flashing crimson, I saw something that chilled my blood. The door to a patients room opened slowly, softly, as if the person behind it couldnt believe it was unlocked.

I couldnt believe it either. Id only talked personally to the most docile patients, but many of them were extremely dangerous.

Fighting a sudden spike in my headache, I blinked continually, struggling to determine who it was that had escaped. His silhouette flitted shadow and red as he moved about, looking up and down the hall. He couldnt see me, shrouded in darkness as I was, but I could see him I knew him. He wasnt too dangerous.

Beside him, another door opened and then another.

It occurred to me that the power outage was no accident - and *someone had unlocked all of the doors.*

One by one, they crept into shifting shadow and scarlet, releasing their particular flavor of insanity into the halls. I could hear some muttering, some shouting, some looking for weapons, some looking for staff!

I thought to lock the door and hide - but they would certainly check the on-call room.

I couldnt stay there.

Heart pounding, I dropped my white coat and slid out into the darkness between two rotating emergency lights. Could they see my silhouette against the red? I saw them creeping about, like curious animals, spreading through the halls. I pushed up against the wall, and some wandered past me, muttering obscenities and twitching.

My headache sharpened into a blinding pain for a moment, and I almost groaned in pain - but I grabbed my own mouth, forcing my body silent. The rotating red lights and darkness shot pain through my eyes, straight to my headache

It was only twenty feet away - I stumbled for a side exit to the building, intending on running. There was nothing I could do except escape and call somebody.

It was locked. Was it supposed to be locked? Damnit damnit I struggled to breathe against my searing headache and the massive throbbing of my adrenaline-spiked heart.

I had very little room for maneuvering. Patients moved within feet of me in the darkness; one stopped under an emergency light, his body cast in the color of blood - and someone else stabbed him, spurting black liquid from under his collarbone. He screamed, and I could hear attention turn toward the area.

The sound of falling meat came, along with continued screams, and something squishy slid across the floor, hitting my shoe with a strange wet plop. The large patient who had done the grisly hack job looked my way, peering into the darkness.

Reflexively ducking into one of the patients rooms, I closed the door softly behind me.

Please dont hurt me! a girl whispered from the corner.

I wont, I whispered back, relieved. Im staff.

Oh God, oh God, whats going on? she breathed.

The barest light filtering under the door illuminated her only enough for me to see her out of the edges of my vision. Cast in sickly red, she was emaciated, a gaunt and unwholesome sight. I knew her immediately. Wait here, I said, burning with an idea.

I poked my head out the door - looked either direction - adrenaline surged, and I darted for the other side of the hall. I grabbed a tray of food from inside, and then darted back. I heard a shout of anger, but I couldnt tell if someone had seen me.

Eat this, I told her.

She moved back an inch. No!

Just try, I whispered, pleading. Itll help us, I promise.

Quivering, she picked up a glob of jello. A moment later, she dropped it, making a disgusted noise. It fell in the light coming under the door, and I could see a dark gobbet inside it.

Again, I said.

She lifted a half-eaten apple to her mouth, and then dropped it, on the verge of tears. I held it to the soft light - what looked like a severed tendon slid from the apples core.

Again, I ordered.

Crying, she lifted, and then dropped the remains of a sandwich.

I pulled the bread back. Yes! I took our discovery, stripped of it extraneous tissue, and snapped it in half.

She gave a sobbing laugh.

In the scant red light, I held up two finger-length fragments of bone, both wickedly jagged, both still slick with gristle.

She grabbed my arm so as not to lose me in the dark, and we crept to the side door again, while screams of pain and screams of glee sounded from around nearby corners.

Come on, come on, I whispered, poking the two bone fragments into the lock. I knew the building was shoddily constructed and poorly funded, and I was counting everything on this lock being a piece of - yes! It clicked open.

A looming presence pounced from behind. She screamed and ran through the door while I pushed the wild-eyed man back. We rolled, grappling. He had a weapon; I thought I was dead for sure, until red light illuminated me, and he saw my own wild eyes. Im sure a week of poor sleep and my blasting headache contributed to my decrepit appearance.

Oh, he breathed, grinning. Thought you were *them.* Come on, lets get out of here, brother.

Amazed, I stood, turning to the side door - and a figure moved in the way, slamming it shut.

---

What the *hell are you doing?* the chief of medicine demanded.

I looked around at clean, clear hallways, lit in harsh white. Mabel moved papers around down at a nurses station. Moments ago, I had seen it empty, lit in rotating red, crowned by dangerous silhouettes crawling this way and that

Acting out a patients story, I quickly lied. That blind girl that writes, she wrote a story about an escape attempt. I was seeing if it was possible. Turns out, this doors lock really *is* faulty. Lucky guess, eh?

He looked me up and down for several long moments with a hard and unreadable glare. Cant fault that I suppose, but you look like an idiot. He looked down at the side door. And Ill contact maintenance, have the lock replaced. Nice catch go take a day off, you look like hell.

I nodded and bore a smile as he walked away. I watched him talk to Mabel, and then proceed around the corner. Strangely, I could still hear distant screams in the halls, each being cut off one by one, as if the surreal delusion was taking its good time fading from my mind

What the hell had just happened?

Had I suffered a waking dream due to exhaustion? Or did someone, afraid of my progress, spike my pain pills?

Dumbfounded, I wandered back to the on-call room, finding my white coat on the floor and my laptop unharmed. Was I losing my mind? I couldnt help but notice that *I* now fit the pattern that every other patient here had fallen into not so far gone as them, but certainly working my way there. The only difference seemed to be that *I* had real evidence and a real pattern; something terrible was *really happening* - or was that the same way theyd all felt?

I find it no small irony that this fifth account is my own.

I do have one advantage, though. Im aware of the pattern, have all of their tales to help me. If that moment comes, that one true step into madness when each of *them* crossed the line I wont. I promise myself that. You cant have an objective view of the larger picture *and* go insane - thats what Ill believe. The two are mutually exclusive.

But I wont stop. Not now. That last tale, the one I was I was interrupted writing out, and havent even been able to fully process yet its disturbing. It fits. I need to think on it. I think Im on the verge of understanding the impetus behind the patterns even though Im not sure I want to.

I did take a break to clear my head. As I walked the halls, digging through my apparently faulty memories for any clue about what had really happened during my delusional episode, two things jumped out at me.

My headache was gone - and so was that emaciated girl

[The Scholarship](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ydz7/the_scholarship/)

After todays events, Im unsure whether I should continue my investigation.

I resolved to speak personally to patients, rather than just read files; I had the notion that, if there was some agency working against me - possibly involving the chief of medicine - I should find patients without written or oral accounts. Only those furthest gone have refused to give statements but I will be the only one to know their stories, and that will put me a step ahead.

I decided to start with the most heartbreaking patient we have. For several months, he has been unresponsive to any attempts to help him. I cant imagine being in his situation but I have seen him recently responding to the nurse that takes care of him.

Oh hey, I havent seen you. I meant to say, thanks for handling the mail for me when I was out, she greeted me, smiling warmly.

Caught off guard, I only managed a weak reply. Sure thing. I was always slightly flustered around her. For anonymitys sake, Ill call her Claire. She was one of the prettiest nurses on staff, and I could see how our most unfortunate patient might open up to her. You know, this might sound weird, but I have a favor to ask you

She seemed skeptical, and a little wary, but she relented.

She was also quite successful.

She and Mabel, a much older career nurse, both set up the room for the recording session. Its not that the patient was dangerous - in fact, quite the opposite - but his special condition merited extra observers, just in case.

Claire even brought us coffee - and handed a cup to me personally. Its nice that youre taking a personal interest. The other doctors couldnt care less.

I gave a sheepish smile, and turned slightly red, Im sure. Thanks!

I immediately grimaced when she turned away. I felt like an idiot schoolboy all over again.

The coffee mug paused before my lips, and I looked down at the swirling cream in brown, recalling certain unpleasant connotations from another patients story. Overcome with a slight wave of disgust, I put the mug down, unable to drink it.

I shook it off and focused on the task at hand. 

He lay in bed, unmoving, giving no indication that he was aware of me.

Whenever youre ready I said, hesitant.

Mabel stood by with the recorder.

Go ahead, honey, Claire told him.

He immediately began speaking. It amazed me - he wasnt catatonic at all. His voice came out clear and articulate, with a strange undertone of grim mockery, as if he knew some vast dark inside joke which hed been keeping all to himself

---

You want to know *my* tale? Im not quite sure that you do. Its far closer to you than you realize.

Ok, but remember, you asked for it

As all stories eventually do, mine involves a girl.

Oh, she was so pretty. Beautiful, even. I watched her from afar quite often. She didnt know I even existed, and probably didnt want to.

Im no slouch [mocking laughter] I wasnt without girlfriends. It just seems that I always wanted the ones I couldnt have. I was starting to feel out of place in my old haunts, nearer thirty than twenty, and time just seemed to darken and then, this light came around - her.

I wasnt obsessed. I want to make that clear. I just thought she was pretty. I didnt actually think I had a chance, and I didnt try to make a move.

Im glad things happened the way they did, though.

One night I was sitting at my regular bar, alone, and all the other tables were taken. She and her friends came in, three girls in total, and *sat right down at my table.* Like a deer in headlights, I stumbled through introductions to each of them. 

Ive seen you around, staring at me, she said, laughing. You a creep, or just a misunderstood nice guy?

*She* was speaking to *me!*

Nice guy! I insisted. You girls want a round? Ill buy.

And of course they accepted.

One of her friends seemed rather interested in me, but I had eyes only for *her.* The friend invited me to a party with them later, and I tagged along, high on excitement and possibility.

Once at the party, I dodged the amorous friend, and found *her* chatting up some guy. No matter - he was just some asshole, and I knew I would win out in the end even if he took her home that night. While I stumbled through small talk, I became aware that I was quite the third wheel in that little corner of the room.

Go get me a drink, she said, laughing awkwardly.

Sure thing, I immediately agreed.

I stumbled through the crowded rooms to the keg and filled up a cup like she asked, returning it to her quickly.

Thanks, she said with a smile.

I felt rather stupid, for awhile there. I was just a guy, blundering around, looking for affection in all the wrong ways

until the party ended, and she ended up by herself on the couch. I listened to her complain about assholes and creeps for nearly two hours. That guy shed been talking to had left her high and dry, running off with some *skank*. I nodded, gleeful at how right Id been and here she was, confiding in *me.*

Thats when she said it.

You *are* a nice guy. Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

Stunned, it was all I could do to say yes.

I met her at the mall, and we spent the day together as she tried on clothes and showed them to me. I even bought her a few, saying yes dear jokingly but she just smiled, and didnt correct me.

I was high on cloud nine.

We spent almost every day together, after that. I have to admit, sometimes it got painful. I wanted her so badly, but she never seemed emotionally available for *real* intimacy asshole guys came and went, and I managed to secretly sabotage most of them.

Most of them.

I was in a fight for her heart, so I dont feel bad about it.

Oh, no, you misunderstand me - I didnt do anything criminal. Just little snide comments - or lies about her, when she wasnt listening or lies about him, when she was.

While my life began to constrict into a cage of pain and negativity, this constant war to keep her isolated draining everything I had, she seemed to be on her own dark path. She started to get into drugs, no matter how much I argued against it - Id tell her, Im your best friend, Im worried about you, *dont do this* but that only seemed to encourage her.

At least she kept herself away from the real dangerous stuff; she only used the drugs that wouldnt ruin her appearance or social standing.

One day, I couldnt take it anymore. I cornered her in her apartment and confessed - spilled - poured out my infinite love for her. Id do *anything* for you, I told her, feeling incredible.

She didnt seem very happy about it. She actually seemed a little angry but, after a few minutes, she came back into the room and asked: Anything?

All I had to do was prove it, she said, and she might learn to love me back.

Anything, I promised.

I spent the next several months running around doing her errands, buying her things, and taking on a second job to support her spending habits. Always, she promised, she was about to return my feelings. Meanwhile, she got into some sort of graduate school, something she was always vague about. I gladly paid for as much of it as I could.

She seemed to get worse, growing darker and angrier as time went on. Often, I found her stoked out on something, or passed out on something, and if I complained, she began to hit me. I thought, Im a man, I can take it, its fine.

One day, when I told her I was broke and couldnt afford another massive tuition payment, she cut me.

We separated then, for a time, and I felt my whole world collapsing. Shed been just about to love me, shed shouted in anger, we were so close

I went to her with roses, and a check. Id taken out a huge loan to pay for her school.

She took me back with open arms, even kissed me on the lips for the first time.

Anything, she ordered. Anything!

I agreed. Id do anything for her. She was my whole world. As long as she validated me, Id be on cloud nine!

Her violence and anger didnt stop in fact, she began enjoying it. I could tell. She had a scalpel now, and often cut me with it. The shoulder, the leg, just a little bit but more, each time. If I cried out in pain or refused, shed threaten to dump me. I let her do it and you know, I began to enjoy it a little myself. After each act of increasing violence, we got a little more close we even made out once, as I bled profusely from a gash down my arm.

We were so, so close she had an idea, she said shed been thinking about for quite some time

I know you think this is insane, but I wanted it. The tradeoff was worth it. What would *you* do for love? It was all finally working out.

I let her do it, and we finally made love.

Everything finally seemed worth it. All the heartbreak and pain and weaseling and sabotaging asshole guys it was all worth it. I adjusted to life without my left hand fairly well, too. Its surprising how many laws there are to help disabled people out.

Of course, things broke down again after that. Without my left hand, I lost one of my jobs. She dumped me again for a bit, screaming and raving that she was halfway done with graduate school. I promised her I loved her, that Id do anything, and she told me to prove it.

She took my entire left arm this time, amputated at the shoulder.

It turned her on enough that we were sexual together for almost a month. Best month of my life, Im telling you.

And then, you know how things go relationships go up and down and I figured, I was far too invested to quit now. I was terrified of losing her after literally putting an arm and a leg into the relationship.

[snicker]

But no, I really was horrified of losing her. She told me that nobody else would *ever* love someone like me, not with those mutilations. I knew she was right.

Eventually, I gave up my other arm and leg to prove my love. Our bond was permanent by that point. I knew she would always take care of me, now that I had permanent, large disability payments to give her.

I couldnt help but scream when she sewed up my eyes. Thats what the neighbors heard, why they called the police. Those bastards I have the perfect relationship, the way I always wanted it, and she loves me, and they tried to ruin that!

---

I stared at him, dumbfounded. Id always wondered how he got that way - blind, just a torso, a head, and a mouth - but the true story was beyond comprehension. *This* this was insanity. I could see it, feel it tangibly, for a few scant moments. Not some affliction, not some chemical imbalance - but humanity - wants, *needs*, gone too far

Wait, I insisted, heart pounding. You never told anyone that someone *did this to you.* Whats her name?

On his blank face, his mouth curled up into a grin.

I leaned forward. Come on, shes abandoned you, she needs to be taken into custody and treated. Shes dangerous! She could still hurt somebody! Why would you protect her now?

He began laughing, a harsh, ironic sound. She hasnt abandoned me

I looked to my right, intending to look to Mabel for suggestions - but she was passed out, coffee dribbling down her shirt.

My body seemed to react before I consciously had any notion of my true level of danger.

It was the high squeal that alerted me, a split second before. I turned and stumbled back in one swift motion, avoiding the electroshock clamps that had been about to hit my head from behind. They sparked lethally as they touched where I had just been.

She came for me, and I shoved a food tray and stand at her, knocking the charged clamps from her hands. They snapped on the ground. She came again.

A flash of silver barely missed me, and I pushed out hard. Falling on the floor, I scrambled away as Claire lunged at me, her scalpel sticking through the middle of my left hand.

Jesus Christ! I remember screaming, suddenly rushing with adrenaline and red rage.

Possessed by the strength of sheer survival instinct, I pushed against the knife and her, slamming her back against the opposite wall.

I pulled back to hit her in the head - but she was already out.

I tied her up, wrapped up my hand - thankfully, not horribly injured, due to the scalpels sharpness - and checked on Mabel. She was alive, but drugged.

The room was in chaos, littered with blood and medical instruments.

Lying in the bed, limbless, blind, he kept crying, asking for his Claire.

Ill admit, my lip quivered, I shook, and I couldnt help but let some tears slide. Overwhelmed I didnt know what else to think or do. Shed just tried to kill me and I couldnt even imagine what she would have done to Mabel and I if shed managed to drug us both and tie us up

The coffee. Shed drugged the coffee and Id only avoided it because of that girls story

The next hour was a blur.

I ended up in the chief of medicines office, filled with righteous anger.

I want to know whats going on here, I demanded. How the *hell* could we have missed this? How did Claire serve on this staff so long without anyone realizing? Even I

What? the chief asked, turning his head slightly. Even you what?

Im going to call the police, I responded, changing the topic.

He raised his lips in a subtle smile, and swept a hand over the phone. Go ahead.

I reached for it.

Youre not going to call the police, he continued. And how do I know that?

He waited.

how? I asked.

He continued immediately, almost interrupting my single word. Because you yourself have been engaging in obsessive behavior exactly the same as any of our patients. You stay up all night reading files, youre convinced theres a pattern or a conspiracy, and youre starting to take their stories seriously without any evidence.

I felt a pit grow in my stomach.

The only difference between you and them, he finished softly. Is a label. One word - *crazy* - and absolutely nothing you do will be taken seriously. You will never leave here.

His words almost got to me - almost. Thats ridiculous. I can talk my way out of that.

He turned in his chair halfway, looking away - contemplating. Maybe so. Youre quite smart, Ill give you that. But lets take another tack - you call the police, they shut this place down, we all lose our jobs, and you never work in this industry again.

I slammed my right fist on his desk. I dont care about that!

He sighed, and then resumed smiling. I believe you. Youre a man of principle. And youre smart. Instead of threatening you, let me offer you something instead: if you shut this place down, you wont have access to anymore files or patients. Youll never figure out this pattern youre concerned with.

I withdrew my bandaged hand from above the phone, drawing in an angry breath.

His smile widened. Good boy.

I hated him with a passion, but he was right. I wasn't about to abandon these people to whatever was going on.

Some time later, I stood outside Claires solitary confinement, gazing in the window. It felt surreal, seeing one of our staff now in a straightjacket herself she begged and pleaded from the other side of the glass, promising that she would love me if I just let her out she'd seen me looking, knew I was interested...

Its a strange thing, insanity, my mentor said. Older than me, but not as old as the chief of medicine, I was his direct report - and hed become someone I could rely on.

Whats going on here? I asked, feeling at the end of my rope. Is there anything youve seen, noticed, suspected?

He kept his gaze on the window into the cell. Ive always liked you, so I *will* give you some advice. I hope you take it to heart. He turned and looked at me. The world has nearly eight billion people in it now. On the sheer math of the thing, the math of outliers, the number of the afflicted is bound to increase. Theyre each inventing new and more horrible ways to lose their minds as they each become outliers further and further into the black

He began walking, and I followed beside him.

Meanwhile, as resources grow more scarce, he continued. The amount of money society is willing to dedicate to taking care of the sick shrinks. The number of sick increase, the money to take care of them decreases you can see the problem.

I narrowed my eyes, not entirely certain, but I let him continue speaking.

Now, if I were a shrewd person in charge well, lets put it this way. Some patients are dangerous or non-functional. Some based purely on the math of random distribution, again... some patients delusions are carefully stable and balanced, so much so that they are harmless or, one could even say helpful. I would put these patients in charge of the others.

My sense of unease grew pronounced - my mentor rarely spoke so darkly, or so vaguely. What are you saying? Are you saying the chief knew that Claire?

He held up a hand. Im not saying anything.

He moved away quickly, leaving me standing there. He paused about ten feet away, but did not turn around.

And its quite possible, he added. Just on probability, I remind you that some patients could develop delusions that, like random molecules, could form in such a way as to be

Contagious? I asked, thinking of a virus, carefully shaped and constructed by randomness to be infectious and deadly.

Just conjecture, he said. Just probability. More patients, less care, worse and worse issues Im just saying, be careful with how you regard the patients stories. There is no defense against an idea.

I stared after him as he continued to the rest of his duties, more confused than before - but absolutely certain that something very bad was going on. Like a body left to rot and fester with untold viruses, this hospital was what? Containment?... or an incubator?

Either way, it was time to reconsider just how far I wanted to take this investigation

[The Bonewalker](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13w6xo/the_bonewalker/)

After reading several files of the patients here, Im starting to become a little concerned. I have this notion that theres some sort of pattern here, but I cant quite define it yet. Im especially concerned about the last male patients claims that he is being shocked or mistreated. We do *not* do shock therapy here.

Shock therapy would actually be a possible treatment for severe unresponsive depression, which is exactly what he has but we dont do that here

While reading through files last night, one girls transcript leapt out at me. I know its strongly part of the pattern Im sensing, but I still cant quite put it together


---


That sound - can I have some of that?

The coffee.

Come on, its just coffee.

*Give it to me!*

Alright, Ill tell you - but this better not be a trick. You promise?

Where do you want me to start?

Ok it was class, honestly. 

Yeah, class. Think its ridiculous that someone like me could have gone to college, [expletive]? Its actually how I ended up like this.

My familys not rich. Bet that doesnt surprise *you*. Were not illegals, though. Just new to the country, and not well off. I was the first one in my family to get into a good college. My older sister screwed around in high school, but I worked myself half to death. I figured, once I get in, its all set. I can relax.

Then I actually got there.

Everyone around me seemed so immature, so stupid. They partied *all the time.* They never studied, never did their homework, nothing. Half of them didnt even show up to class. The football players, they didnt even take the exams. I couldnt understand it. Did they have any idea how much college cost? I still dont know.

My parents called me about three months in. I was taking over the maximum amount of classes, because we only had enough money for three years between the family and the scholarships Id earned. I had to graduate in three years, that was the plan.

They told me that my gran was sick. The family was going to spend the money on her healthcare. I said fine, thats great, I love gran.

I was in denial for a little, there. I thought, maybe Ill just get some scholarships. Maybe I can make this work. Student loans, maybe. The thought of all that debt terrified me - I would never, *ever* work off the amounts they were talking about. My parents always said, We didnt come here just to live destitute all over again.

A month or so out from the end of that first semester, I got an email about a scholarship that was considering me. I thought all my problems were solved - it was a full ride!

But the deadline for an essay submission was the next day. No problem, I figured. I had a test and four classes with large amounts of homework, but I could do it. This was important.

So I drank some coffee, stayed up late, fell asleep about five in the morning that next day was tired and uncomfortable, and I did a little worse on the test than I wanted, but I got it all done.

I got an email response to my submission *that night*. They liked my essay! I was so happy - until I read that I was just in the next pool. The next level required an in-depth analysis of an industry - thirty pages! And it was due in a few days! Had everyone else known about all this for months? Had the other candidates had all the time in the world to finish the work?

Since it was on my mind, I chose the student loan industry. That was probably a mistake - all I learned was how *screwed* I would be if I didnt get this scholarship. A hundred thousand dollars or more for three or four years and no rights, no bankruptcy, no protections it was all worse than a loan shark deal, and, from my neighborhood, I *knew* how bad loan sharks could be.

I hit the coffee hard. A neighbor in the dorms gave me some pills, but I didnt feel good about it, and left them in my backpack. I got maybe three hours of sleep a night for the next few days, struggling to get through all my classes, homework, and tests, and then also do this huge paper. I knew my classwork was suffering, but a few days wouldnt ruin my grades. This scholarship was important

I was at my limit when I submitted that damn thirty-page paper. Burnt out, exhausted, and fried on a week of caffeine and no sleep

I slept terribly that night, but it was still a breeze through my pained body.

I awoke to an email congratulating me on being one of five candidates remaining in the nation. I didnt understand - had they reviewed all the thirty-page papers overnight? Or had everyone else failed to get it done on time? Maybe that was it - maybe they only got five papers, because nobody else had the time

They wanted a graduate-level thesis in two weeks.

I spent that entire day stunned. I couldnt even comprehend the level of work required for this full ride scholarship and it was getting into finals time. I think I almost broke down crying, until I realized that I *did* have a friend in the graduate program

She agreed to meet with me, and helped me hash out exactly what I needed to do. Shed been working on hers for a year she expressed some skepticism about the scholarship competition I was engaged in, but she said, Better go for it - you dont want to end up like me. Ive got so many loans, Ill never be out of debt.

I struggled to maintain my composure in response to that. What, so if I fail to write a thesis in two weeks, Ill end up with huge debt for the rest of my life?

The pills in my backpack started to make some sense.

They made it almost easy, actually.

I went to class, studied for finals, and worked on my thesis. I did it all.

Everything except sleep.

Between the pills and the coffee, I *felt* horrible, but I was awake - and working twenty-four hours a day was all that mattered. I had to get that scholarship. I *had to.*

I thought I could actually make the deadline but halfway there, a week in, I could feel my body starting to give out. I hadnt slept well in a week and a half, and hadnt slept at all in six days and there was still another week to go.

I went to my neighbor to ask for more pills he was sick, sniffling, and talking to him filled me with disgust. He just seemed *gross* full of snot and spittle and his eyes were all bulgy I took the pills and got out of there.

I started doubling the dose. Then, I tripled it.

I reached a strange plateau of pained awareness and strained energy that kept me working on everything straight through the next week. I knew that what I was doing was dangerous, but I had to do it. It would be worth it. I was going to win that scholarship I knew it.

I hit a wall the day before it was due.

Staring at the massive thesis Id produced, just a few pages from the end - the most critical portion, the conclusions, all escaping me - I couldnt form the words in my head. I couldnt think the things I needed to type out. I blinked a few times, trying to get my head straight

I was on my laptop, in the library. I looked around in tired confusion. My dorm room, the library, and class had all become a blur as my days without sleep melded into one another.

It was night, and the library was quiet. Beyond the breathy exhaustion running under my every feeble movement, I suddenly felt uneasy.

My own fatigued breath rasped and echoed in my head. That much Id gotten used to. But now, alone in the library in the middle of the night, I could hear something else breathing
I carefully packed up my laptop and research books, staying as quiet as I could. I saw nothing strange, but I had this hunch that I really needed to get out of there.

I took the back way around the stacks, trying not to be seen.

About four rows down, I heard a wet, organic smacking sound.

My eyes burning from the sheer effort of looking around, I froze. Was there something in the library with me? My ears found it then, as it schlepped itself down the aisle a few feet over. I peered around the corner.

A strange, fleshy mass pushed itself toward me.

Staring, terrified, I tried to figure out what it was. It had these limbs - skin all stretched and flabby - and the whole monstrous thing pulsed with this this throbbing it was like a disgusting, glistening sack of flesh and pulsing organs, textured sickeningly, with hair poking out in random places

That wet, smacking sound - the mouth, an orifice into the horrific thing, *bones* sticking out from the gummy ridges inside - God, I remember every moment staring at that thing - and then it turned these white, moist protrusions at me - and I knew it could see me. It made a gurgling, wheezing sound, and moved toward me more quickly.

I bolted. Yeah, screw it, Im a small girl, and I ran like hell. What would you do?
There was another one in the stairwell. I almost ran straight into it. It made a weird, high-pitched noise, and then reached one throbbing limb for me. The skin seemed stretched by stringy veins, pushing something foul throughout its mass

I ran again.

I had a knife already, you know. Im not from a great neighborhood. It was about then that I knew I might have to use it. These horrible *creatures* were in the library, and I had to escape at any cost I had to finish my thesis.

Knife held out, I ran down and for the front door. Another creature stood by the door, shambling and rasping. It squealed as it saw me, its middle expanding as it drew in breath, preparing for some sort of attack, no doubt. Through the glass doors, outside, I could see a distant campus security uniform - salvation, or at least help.

I slashed the creature across its expanding middle, tearing the spongy flesh open. It seemed to immediately release all sorts of acrid, quivering organs, red and brown and purple, and I couldnt help but puke, tears streaming down my face. Id never seen anything so disgusting.

Leaving the ruptured sack of flesh on the ground, I ran for the doors.

I remember that moment, screaming for help. That uniformed figure came over, approaching me quickly

And it was one of them.

I stabbed that one, too. Sliced it up and ran for my dorm room.

Im not sure what I was thinking. I was fully awake from the shock, that was for sure. I finished my thesis while covered in blood, and submitted it.

They came for me maybe an hour later. I cant remember it, but apparently I was just sitting there smiling. I hadnt even tried to sleep.

Then you know the rest. And you people tell me that I had an episode, that my filters were fried, and that I was just seeing humans the way they really look, without familiarity or recognition and that doesnt make me feel better. I still see tissues, and pulsing, stringy veins, and throbbing organs in a loose sack of flesh - when I look at myself. You, you stay behind that mirror. Keep me isolated. Am I still broken? What if I *never get better?* Keep my family away, keep my gran away I cant see them like that, God Im so tired

Wheres the coffee? You promised! I can hear you drinking it back there!

*GIVE IT TO ME!*

Going over the poor girls transcript, I had a vague flash of memory. This girl was a recent admission - I ran to our mailroom and checked the shredder trash. I thought Id seen something

And it was there.

Someone had sent her a letter, to *this* address. It arrived before she did. It hadnt made any sense at the time, and Id only randomly been the one to do the mail that day, due to a nurses sick day.

*-gratulations,* the pieces said. *Youre one of three remaining candidates! To qualify for this next round, please submit within three weeks, a four-thousand page -*

The rest of the typed letter was shredded away, and I couldnt find the envelope or any relevant names or contact information in the pile of paper strips beneath. No matter - this was enough. Something was going on, and this was proof enough to start some sort of investigation.

Interesting, the chief of medicine told me, reading the pieces. He leaned back in his large leather chair. This does match the story you told me

I think something bigger is going on here, I said.

Whats it matter? he replied, quite serious.

Theres more to the story than *shes crazy*. Doesnt it warrant investigation?

She still sees people as monsters, still carved up a security officer and a classmate, he replied. So someone played a prank with this scholarship thing. Shes still the one that didnt sleep for weeks and gave herself brain damage.

Why arent you more interested? I asked, growing a little angry. This is *something*. At the very least, we uncover some sort of dangerous fraud scholarship.

Thats not our job.

I suddenly clued in that he was absolutely not going to help or condone further investigation in any way. Yeah, youre right, Im sorry, I lied gracefully.

He smiled. He liked to be right.

On my way out, he said one last thing. Ive heard reports that youre engaging in some odd behavior yourself. Reading files late at night, that sort of thing. Dont get too close to these patients. Dont regard their stories as anything other than fabrications of obsessed minds.

Why? I asked. Afraid crazy is contagious?

Quite stern, he set his jaw, and gave no response. My comment had been flippant, but his grim response gave me pause.

Im now convinced that something more is going on - not just with this latest girl, but with other patients as well and Im starting to wonder if we have something to do with it

Update: I'm now certain we are involved in something very dark:

	<TEXT> Yes, they've never done a shot like that. But get this.

They zoom in on the zombies all bloody and eating this guy's guts.

They cut to commercial.

It's a commercial for **KFC chicken.** It's the only KFC commercial I've ever seen on the show. The first thing the KFC announcer says is "Mmm, ain't that good?" or something like that.

Every single person watching the show with us burst out in uncontrollable laughter for at least 2-3 minutes. The scene + the commercial absolutely had to be on purpose, and it was genius! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After delving into one of the patients [accounts]( http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ty8f/eating_disorder/), Ive become more aware of the bizarre array of afflictions we contain here Ill be honest, I never really thought of the patients as people before. *Crazy* is a label that immediately dehumanizes someone, cutting them off from any sympathy or understanding.

Theres one girl, for instance, who refuses to talk to anyone unless shes allowed to feel their temples for nerve fibers first, whatever that means. Other than that, and some mild paranoia, she seems completely aware and normal - but, before, it was easy to write her off as just another crazy patient. I wonder what shes thinking she refused to give any explanation for her behavior.

The more I read their accounts, the more I realize that these are *real people* afflicted by tortures beyond mundane imagination.

Last night, reading while on break, one mans words caught my attention. I know him. Hes consistently depressed, resigned, and drained - but now I think that, underneath all that, he may be like any of us. Hes just pained by this thing that grips him.

---

Fine, Ill tell you! Just no more shocks. You promised no more shocks if I tell you!

It doesnt make a difference anyway.

I know how it started. Its obvious now, when I think back.

I was on the street, walking with friends. We were drinking, and heading to the next bar, when some weird, disgusting, guy with desperate eyes bumped into me. He smelled like sweat and something else but he spilled something on me. It got on my hand - on my fingernails, specifically.

It was blood. Hed spilled *blood* on me.

He froze, seemed horrified and sad. Im sorry, he said. I believed him, but I didnt know what he was sorry for. He ran.

Disgusted, I cleaned it off and tried to forget about it. Nothing happened for awhile.

Oh God, I remember every detail of that night. Lying by myself in my crappy little apartment - oh how I miss it, a palace compared to your care - I woke up just before it happened. I gazed at my dark ceiling, feeling strange.

And then I was curled up in pain, too shocked even to scream. I remember staring at it, not yet understanding how screwed I was. This long, bloody, blade-thing was sticking *out* from my shin.

Whered it come from? Did someone stab me? I didnt understand I reached for the phone, but seized with pain again as the blade moved. Another long, white, razor-like thing shot out, and the two separated, slicing an open line in my shin. I had sudden visions of the razors continuing, slicing me into sections from the inside out now, I almost wish it had.

I didnt have much time to panic. The slicing stopped. I stared, clutching my leg. Four more bloody protrusions joined the first two, and then - it slid out.

Shaking, numb from shock and panic, I felt a small relief that I wasnt about to be carved up - and then that consolation vanished, as I realized something living had just *crawled out of my shin bone.*

Dripping with my blood, it scanned the room with six pearly eyes. Seemingly carved from bone, it stood on six razor-like legs - the blades that had eviscerated my shin. About two feet high, it was much like a spider

Unexpected, it said. It had no mouth. How did it speak?

unexpected? I asked, numb and terrified.

Who are you?

Trembling and on the verge of tears, I just wanted it to go away. Nobody important

That was the wrong answer.

It jabbed a leg back into my exposed shin bone, neatly avoiding the separated flesh and streaming blood. I felt a sharp jab in my chest - I understood implicitly, horrified, that this creatures razor leg entered my tibia, but emerged from one of my ribs. A bladed point pressed against my heart from the inside

Please, please, I begged, sweat running into my eyes. Ill do anything you say, Ill do it, Ill do it, just dont kill me

Acceptable, it replied.

It withdrew its leg, and the pain in my chest went with it.

You will do as instructed or die in utmost pain.

Yes, yes, thats fine, I choked out, sobbing.

It climbed back into my exposed bone and then it was gone, having given me no instructions. I went to the hospital, got my leg sewn up, claimed it was an accident and it seemed I had my life back.

I was wrong.

It slid out between my stitches a few nights later. Dismayed, but ready, I made sure to memorize everything I could about it. Spindly, deadly, it was strangely beautiful, in an ivory and insect sort of way. *Somebody* had to know about this thing.

It gave me orders. It made me do things.

It started with small crimes. It wanted them done in a specific manner, with contrived evidence left behind for reasons I wasnt told. It directed me to dangerous criminal locales, though other people were the least of my concerns by then. One of its other slaves gave me a long animal bone treated with that special blood, and it often made me bring this bone to shady locations.

It would emerge from that bone and converse with someone - someone aware of it, able to defend from it? Someone it needed to make a deal with for its purposes? I never saw him. I doubted he would help me, even if I found him

I gave up hope after many failed nights of searching for an answer or help. Id beaten people. Mugged them. Held up a convenience store at knifepoint. It even made me get that cursed blood on this guys fingernails, and I had to watch as he was slowly separated into sections by protruding razor legs his hand, falling to the floor his leg, popping off at the knee by a rotating slice screaming, begging, pleading it tortured him to death for information I didnt understand and it made me pick up his pieces and dispose of them oh God

Whenever I wasnt on assignment, I turned to other ways to distract myself from the black pit of despair welling up inside me.

My brother found me on the street after a few months of this. I remember every detail of that, too.

You have to come home, he insisted. Well get you off the drugs, clean you up. Dadll get you a job.

The *drugs* arent the problem, I remember shouting at him. Theyre the only thing that keep me from losing my mind. Its *the bonewalker* -

As I said those words, a sharp jab hit me underneath my left shoulder blade. The next scratched the side of my right lung. I realized it was watching me the message was clear. If I told anyone, it would carve me up from the inside out.

Get out of here! I screamed at him, feeling every bit the same now as that disgusting and desperate man whod bumped into me. You cant help me! Go away!

I hit the hard drugs even harder, then. At some point, I was drained of everything even resembling my old self, and I decided not do it anymore - even if it meant my death. At its behest, Id bought a rifle, and trained in its use. It wanted me to kill somebody, somebody important but when it came with the name and plan, I would refuse.

I wondered how it would do it. Would it stab inward from my skull, killing me instantly? Or would it slice out from each of my bones, carving me up slowly, like that poor, poor man?

I stared at the gun, wondering if it would go after my family if I refused. Did I really have a choice? Could I sacrifice my brother, too? And my parents? I had to make the bonewalker think it wasnt my fault

I called and left an anonymous tip. I sat there, filled with relief and calm, as they surrounded me and put on the handcuffs. I sat in custody, ostensibly caught by the police; when the bonewalker came, it would have no reason to punish my family. It would just kill *me*, and that was that.

But it never came.

I mean, I know why it didnt return, now but Im broken, and stuck here in any case. And I keep thinking what if there are more? What if they come for me someday, because I know?

Therell be no warning it could come at any time just a sharp, sliding sensation, and then Ill be dead

---

The thing that captivates me about his account is that its very similar to some ravings left by a man who died horribly awhile back. He was mutilated in ways unimaginable - as if his face had been torn off from the inside, among other things. His story made the news, and they figured he was the serial killer responsible for several similar horrific deaths

But that man claimed that, as his last act, hed managed to destroy the creature.

I suppose *this* man must have read about the prior mans issues, and formed an obsession or delusion about it.

I find it curious how contagious crazy seems to be and seemingly more so these days. Im starting to wonder if this place is truly run to help these people - or whether its really just here to *contain* them like quarantine for a plague.


Update: And now I'm convinced something more is going on:

	<DATE> 2012-11-26 21:56:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the interests of anonymity, I will say only that I work in health care. We seem to get more than our fair share of strange patients; one, specifically, has been on my mind lately.

The girl in question, a recent admission, had a story disturbing enough to run through the inter-department grapevine fairly often. Tired of hearing the same gossip repeated endlessly, I pulled and read her file, intending to debunk the rumors.

I wish I hadnt.

The following is a cleaned-up version of her personal written account.

---

This is all a misunderstanding, honestly. Im fine. *I* am not the problem. Theres someone else out there responsible for this - *theyre* doing this to torture *me*. I shouldnt even be here.

Ive had some issues with body image. That much is true. I was actually failing yet another diet when it first happened.

We were out celebrating Beckys promotion. The five of us were at dinner - it was a really nice restaurant, but I cant remember which - and my diet willpower was running on empty. We'd all had a glass or two of wine by the time my salad came. Id resolved to eat only half of it, and only that much so as not to cause a scene on Beckys night. The girls pestered me whenever I refused to eat

Still, I couldnt help but think it was no coincidence that the skinniest out of the five of us was the first to get promoted. Wed all graduated more than a year ago, and the real world was like slap in the face. None of us were really where we wanted to be.

Except Becky, of course.

Hunger filled me with constant pain, and hating myself for it stressed me to the limit so when the waiter put cheese on my salad, I didnt stop him. I wanted to throw the salad away, to refuse to eat, but I was so hungry

And then, two bites in, angry but putting on a happy face for the girls, I found a long black hair. Wrapping around pieces of lettuce, it immediately disgusted me - Id almost eaten it without realizing it.

We got our meals for free, and the girls didnt even bother me when I couldnt bring myself to eat. The hair had knocked out my hunger completely!

I was on cloud nine for the next day or two. I wasnt hungry, I wasnt stressed - it was amazing. I thought Id stumbled onto some great new form of self-control.

But the girls thought otherwise - or maybe just Becky.

I was at lunch with Andrea when the hunger began to reach a breaking point again. Depleted, sad, I gave in and ordered a large salad. Andrea smiled and said something about being there for me if I needed to talk - I bet she was in on it. In my memories, her smile seems vaguely sinister and mocking, as if she anticipated what would happen

I found a *fingernail* in my salad! A fake red fingernail!

Those things are disgusting - there are so many germs under fake nails - I know!

Lunch was free again, but I couldnt bring myself to eat. The shock and disgust had, again, knocked out my hunger completely.

Part of me was relieved, and empowered. I was going on two weeks without eating, and this whole disgust thing was really helping me lose weight.

But Im not crazy, or stupid. I know that you have to eat *sometimes*.

Another day or two passed, and I ordered a chicken salad while at brunch with Becky. She kept gloating on and on about her new job, about how her boss was vaguely hitting on her I hated her so much, secretly, even if outwardly I was happy for her. I was mainly focused on my salad, though. It was sweet relief, finally eating

until I bit down on something hard and squishy.

I spit it out quickly; I remember Beckys exact words.

Oh my god, is that a *toe?*

I remember staring at the thing as it sat on my napkin. It was mushed, ground up, red and cooked a little but a bone clearly stuck out of it.

The entire place shut down temporarily after that, but nobody could figure out where the toe had come from. Obviously, none of the employees were missing it but Becky basked in the attention from the scandal. She even got on local television, even though it was *my* salad that had the toe in it.

This is a travesty. People can get seriously sick if they accidentally eat things like that, shed said to the reporter.

I was starting to wonder whether she had something to do with it

The shock overwhelmed me, dispelling my hunger for a little under a day - but my relief and enjoyment was short-lived. I knew Id have to start eating again, sooner rather than later.

Not up for any more of Beckys sick pranks, I decided to scope the vending machines at the mall.

I hated myself so much, right about then, staring at candy bars and feeling weak but I had to eat, and I had no willpower left. Chocolate would make everything right.

I bit into that thing so amazing sweet, sweet chocolate

It was only two bites in that I saw something poking out between the wrapper and the candy bar, halfway down. Pulling the wrapper back, I couldnt help but hurl it on the floor as I puked up what Id eaten.

Pressed between wrapper and chocolate was what was unmistakably a flap of skin.

Had it been sliced off of somebody? Traces of blood still god!

But how the hell had Becky done it? How had she known?

I was full on terrified and angry then, even if a tiny part of me had been relieved to throw up the two bites Id eaten. Tortured, but still fighting my own urge to not eat, I ordered a slice of pizza at the food court. It came with a large bubble in the crust sickly despairing, I ripped it open, finding what looked like someones cornea cooked inside.

Goddamn Becky - she had to be somewhere around, tracking me, doing this to me. Did she have the help of all the girls?

I drove.

By nightfall, I ended up across the state line. I pulled into a backwater restaurant Id never heard of. Relieved, I ordered a hamburger from the polite old man who probably owned the place. There was no way Becky or the girls could interfere with my food here

The hamburger, slid in front of me on a quaintly decorated plate, looked like the most delicious thing ever. I still considered not eating, still considered continuing my diet and I hated myself for giving in but I didnt want to die. People *have* to eat!

I paused before biting in.

Sliding back the bun, I investigated the contents. Everything seemed normal, until I lifted the tomato from the lettuce. I couldnt tell what it was at first a pinkish grayish blob, a bump in the ketchup I lifted it up by a stringy bit and stared at it, until I finally understood.

It was a piece of *brain matter.*

I would have thrown up, but my heaving stomach had nothing in it.

I drove away from there as fast as I could, continuing in random directions. I dont know how Becky and the girls were tracking me or predicting what I would eat, but I had to evade them

Candy bar from a gas station - nope. Chicken nuggets from a drive through - nope. I still dont understand how they did it! I even begged a younger kid to make me a sub from start to finish, watching the entire process, making sure nothing was in it - he handed it to me, I opened it up, and - oh god - I still remember his expression of confusion and horror as I screamed

But a strange calm came after that. Three weeks without eating? Four? I knew I would die if I didnt eat. I had this strange thought; I had this idea, of a place they couldnt predict, couldnt make disgusting and inedible

I found it. I did - I beat them. I found the most delicious salad, and I ate it desperately, gorging, knowing I was finally saved but Ill be honest, that wasnt what I expected to find the first time I did it. It makes sense, now, though.

When I cracked his skull open with that pipe, I almost couldnt believe it. He fell, and chicken salad splattered across the pavement! Supple green lettuce, crunchy and stringy - strips of chewy chicken - and that dressing that dressing was to die for! I was finding pieces of people in my food, no matter where I ate so the only logical place to find something edible was inside people

---

We have to feed her intravenously. Normal food terrifies and disgusts her. The whole thing makes me wonder how, in this day and age, we can still let the media impose unreasonable body images so powerfully on us

Though shes not the strangest patient we have here, she interests me because of her ability to manipulate the nurses. Apparently - and nobody ever did figure out who helped her - she convinced somebody to sneak body parts into her food the first few times we tried to feed her. At least, thats the only explanation of those incidents that makes sense


Update: I read some more files, and they continue to disturb me...

	<TITLE> A Sketchy Interview </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-11-22 00:08:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had a job interview yesterday that rather bothered me. The ad was rather vague, but I was as desperate for a job as the next guy, so I jumped on the interview offer. I did think it was odd that the interview was so late by the time I found the place, inky autumn darkness surrounded the building like a sinister halo, held back only weakly by buzzing orange streetlamps.

Set at the back of a wide parking lot wasteland, the place seemed like it fit perfectly with the rest of the factory district - a long, low, and massive structure sided with aluminum and brick. Maybe it was just the dim lamplight, or the curious silence beyond the electric buzzing overhead, but I immediately disliked the place. The chilly walk up had me constantly looking around, as if someone might rush from the distant darkness and rob me.

Yeah, if they wanted to run a half mile across dim orange parking lot

For a few tense minutes, I tried blank doors set in the side of the building. There was no indication which one was the actual entrance - they were all locked, and I was just starting to think someone was playing a prank on me when one finally swung open.

The interior was almost hilariously normal. A nice, clean office waiting room lay within. My concerns about my situation faded, and I smiled with relief.

Im here for the I began to say, approaching the receptionist window.

There was nobody on duty. The space behind the window was dark and empty.

Confused, I examined the waiting room. The lights were on, and the front door was open - surely, *somebody* was working. Maybe they just didnt have a receptionist this late. So what? Was I supposed to just walk into the rest of the building? Find my potential boss by wandering around? I silently cursed the vague interview directions.

The sound of glass clinking glass faintly radiated from somewhere. Peering through the receptionist window, I called out, but the shadowed office beyond remained silent.

I tried a door at the back of the waiting room - locked. I tried the one next to it, and it swung open easily, surprising me. Embarrassed, I stepped through, hoping nobody saw me stumble with the door.

The other side opened up into a vast cavern-like space filled with machinery. The jumbled mechanical beasts lay quiet and dim. Was this a manufacturing job? On the far side of the factory, I saw a single bright light hanging over an active machine.

I approached the operator carefully. Overweight and hunched uncomfortably over the controls, he seemed to be quite focused. As I grew closer, I shouted over the rising mechanical screech. Hello? 

He ignored me, or didnt hear me.

Hi, Im here for the interview? I shouted, circling the machine so he could see me.

The screeching stopped abruptly, and the machine died with a fading whirr.

He looked up and lifted his goggles onto his forehead, resting them on his greasy, matted hair. His beady eyes, set above glistening sallow cheeks, focused on me for a long moment.

Good, good, he finally grumbled. Thisll be a field interview. Get it?

I did my best not to look wary. Um

This machine needs some nimble hands.

I dont follow

Huffing, he leaned over, opened a hatch in the machine, and pointed back through a mess of gears, pistons, and other components I didnt recognize or understand. See that? A wrench fell back in there. I cant reach it.


Leaning close to him to see inside, I held my breath against his rank body odor. The air near him seemed to be moist from sweat, and his breath was a foul mix of smoke and - liquor? Not wanting to be rude, I said nothing.

You want me to reach in and get it out? I asked, wondering if he was serious.

Well I sure cant do it, he shot back, rubbing his round belly near strange stains on his shirt.

I considered the idea. The machine was rather low and wide. To reach the back, Id have to crawl completely inside the hatch, among all sorts of components that were obviously in motion when the machine was in operation. Shouldnt you power it off, or something?

It *is* off, kid.

But I just saw you running it

Just in maintenance mode. Now get in there. Or dont you want this job?

Frowning, I leaned closer to the hatch. In the corner of my eye, I saw him lick his lips. I was thoroughly freaked out, but I needed a job

I leaned in a little, trying not to get too near any of the jagged parts that might suddenly start moving. Shaking, I reached out, but I couldnt reach anywhere near the back.

Come on, get all the way in there, he insisted. I imagined I could barely detect a strange note of excitement in his tone.

I moved in another few inches. In the muffled, cramped darkness within, I peered around at the pistons and tubes near my head. I had the sudden fear that, once I crawled inside, he would shut the hatch behind me, trapping me and I still couldnt see the wrench he was talking about. I could almost feel the pistons coming down and crushing me, or the gears rotating and ripping into my limbs.

No job was worth this.

I slid out. Sorry, man, I gotta go

Making some polite excuses, I practically bolted back out through the waiting room and into the chilly night, immensely relieved. I spent the drive back running over the events in my head, wondering if Id just read too much into everything, wondering if Id freaked myself out for no reason and blown a chance at a real job. As my fear faded, I began shaking my head at my own stupidity. Itd been nothing, and Id probably really offended that guy

When I got home, I had an email about the interview. My blood ran cold as I read the apology - the man I was supposed to meet had sent me the wrong address. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Id worked through the evening without so much as a glance at the clock. My home office, once cluttered from the move, had finally taken on the texture of a real working space. That comfort and focus made it easy to buckle down and work the daylight away without distraction. This was maybe the third twilight Id managed to completely miss.

From my protective nook of lamplight, embedded in the darkness like a dim gem on black, I scanned the room with my eyes - and the house with my ears. My new house, although open and relaxing under the sun, seemed to take on a tone of sinister silence once shrouded in the fathomless darkness unique to starless skies.

I hated the constant cloudy weather, used to the city glow and concrete-warmed clear skies as I was - and I hated having to creep into the impenetrable blackness to turn on the lights. Twice before, Id worked through sunset oblivious; twice before, Id endured this ritual, heart pounding, hands blindly feeling across as-yet unfamiliar walls this third time, I hesitated.

I sat and listened to the silence echoing through unseen rooms, wishing the house had constant rumbling breath like the apartment building Id moved from. The rickety old central air system had been an annoyance at the time, but Id have much preferred it to the countrysides insufferable stillness. As I balanced on the edge of my seat, straining the limits of my hearing, the unrelenting absence of stimulation actually approached painful.

And that was when my cellphone rang, scaring the shit out of me.

Laughing with relief, face surely burning red, I picked it up from the table. Id been silly; stupid, even. Id filled myself with fear because Id wanted to be afraid - an indulgence of a childhood long past. Shaking my head, I reminded myself that there was nothing to fear, a fact which I still found disappointing. Sometimes - and recently, more than ever - I wished there really was something supernatural, *anything* supernatural

Hello?

My ear registered a few random noises that I took to be the caller preparing to answer. I waited. No words came.

Hello?

The same purposeless sounds continued.

Confused, I looked at my phone - the number was unfamiliar. Still, I waited, intent on giving the caller a moment to realize theyd called somebody. Id had a coworker once whose phone often accidentally re-prompted the last dialed call, and I was not looking forward to repeated interruptions.

The good ol butt dial, I said loudly, hoping the caller would suddenly have spoken words emanating from their pants. Maybe I was embarrassing someone on a blind date. That would be great. Helloooo -

Nothing but spotty scratching noises.

I hung up.

Placing the phone back on the desk, I swiveled in my chair, facing the task at hand again. The light from my little sphere of lamplight quickly turned into gloom as it traveled across the carpet, fading to sheer black by the time it reached the hallway. I allowed myself the brief inexplicable notion that someone could, given the right position, be standing there in the darkness watching me and I would have no idea

I jumped as the phone rang again. Christ!

I picked it up and calmed my racing heart with self-directed sarcasm. You cannot be serious come on, its just a misdial My voice nearly reached the level of a shout this time. Hello? Hello?!

The sounds were a little different this time - more like a consistent pattern of subtle crunches, punctuated by the sound of fabric moving right against the other phone. It occurred to me that the caller might be walking somewhere, on the seasons freshly fallen leaves yes, that was the noise, I knew now.

The noises paused, and muffled speech filtered through. The unidentifiable words were directed - so the caller was with someone the same voice spoke again there was a pause and then the sound of fabric moving again, and a grunt of exertion.

The circle of darkness around me suddenly plunged shut with a nearly physical sensation of force. Stunned, I listened to the subtle whirr of my computer die down into silence, leaving me with nothing but the startlingly loud sound of my own terrified breathing.

It wasnt hard to make the leap: Id just heard someone cut the power to my house.

My mind raced with possibilities as I sat there in total darkness, struggling to quiet my breathing. I felt as if the unknown enemy could hear the air rasping in my throat, even now

Keeping the phone to my ear, I used my free hand to feel my way across the carpet, heading for the window behind where I normally sat. I reached the wall even as I realized my mistake.

Wait, no - not that one the window facing the utilities box in the backyard would be

In the room at the other end of the hall

Muttered words drifted through the phone, followed by the unmistakable sound of plastic wires scraping against old metal. Whoever they were, they were still at the box, tinkering around - ensuring my home security system was off?

I stared up at the place where I thought my desk might be. Id been just about to get up and turn on all the lights in the house - and if I had, theyd have known I was home. Did they believe me absent? Or did they even care? If they found me, mid-robbery

Steeling my trembling insides, I felt my way across the carpet, heading for the cooler air from the hallway. I could still feel that potential invisible watcher, standing just beyond the door, eyes following my every flailing move in the black I reached the point where a foot might have been, slid my hand out

Nothing. Just carpet.

Shaking my head and struggling to contain my terror at threats both real and imagined, I crawled down the hallway, eyes burning. I couldnt blink, couldnt close my eyes even for a second, despite seeing nothing - I was too afraid Id miss a split-second errant flashlight, or some other detail that would confirm that there were really assailants preparing to enter my house.

I was desperate to hurry, but I didnt dare make a sound. I reached the end of the hallway after what felt like an eternity, still listening to muttering and the sound of tinkering. It was only when I crawled past the door frame, angled wood under my fingers, that I heard the first recognizable words against my now-sweaty ear.

Its good.

Its off? another voice asked.

The first replied with an affirmative tone.

Crawling to the wall as fast as I dared, I felt around for the windows frame - there! I slid up, heavy curtain against the back of my head, and peered out.

Straining my open eyes made no difference. All I could see was the extremely faint glow of my cellphone, barely visible against the panes as I pressed my forehead against the glass.

More audible words came. Whats that?

I ducked, my nerves screaming. Idiot! Had they seen the faint light of my phone?

Just thought I saw something.

Keeping my phone down near my chest, I peered back over. The window was still as good as useless, no matter how hard I stared into - there!

The tiniest peripheral motion, a blur, a blip of pale blue - a cellphone light through jeans fabric.

Somewhere downstairs, a doorknob jiggled. The noise was ever so slight; Id have never given it a second thought if Id heard it in any other situation.

I slumped. Frozen against the wall in terror, I ran through all the objects in the house I might use as a weapon I ran through all the scenarios Id seen in movies, guessed at my best options for defending myself until a calm voice spoke in my thoughts.

Idiot. Call the police.

Id never called the police before. Id never even considered it. With the phone pressed against my ear, full of terror, I hadnt even

I quickly hung up and dialed 911.

The conversation was somewhat of a blur for me. I remember repeating, more than was necessary, that they were already in my house. Multiple men. No, I live alone. They cut the power, cut the security system. Please come now. Please come now.

A creak sounded from the stairs.

Surging with adrenaline, I hung up the phone and clicked it dark.

Another creak emanated from the same place.

Part of me twisted up terribly, preparing for imminent violence. Two, then, were upstairs. Were there more downstairs? I couldnt hear anything

A hushed whisper reached my ears, coming from somewhere in the hallway - right outside the door of the room I cowered in.

Ten seconds passed. Thirty. A minute. Two minutes, at least - then five. Staring into the void, I hovered at the edge of sheer panic for an eternity. What the hell were they doing? Were they just standing there in the hallway? Or were they searching the rooms, not making any noise? I had the terrible premonition that, if I made a single sound, no matter how slight, they would suddenly rush me from some unexpected direction with violent and mindless glee -

I almost didnt register it at first. Not the moment it happened. I felt a vibration in my clenched hand, but I couldnt quite fathom it immediately - between my desperate fingers, the phone rang loudly, practically screaming, filling the house with abrupt noise.

It was that same number, misdialing me a third time - signing my death warrant.

The fuck was that? a threatening voice asked, two rooms down.

I dropped the phone, leaving it to ring on the carpet, and bolted away from the window. Face up, the phones dim light peeled back just enough of the darkness to fill the room with imminent danger - but with no closet and no furniture, I had nowhere to go the unopened moving boxes filling the room offered no safety.

More than one set of footsteps rushed down the hall, the heavy falls filled with violent urgency.

Its just a phone, one said, a few feet away from me.

Yeah? an angry voice asked. Whats it doin on the floor here?

Who knows, maybe hes lazy. I watched his routine for weeks. He *aint home*.

A deadly click sounded, and I stopped breathing. A flashlight beam swept across the room, blinding me. I kept my eyes open, unwilling to close them for fear of the two men hearing my eyelids slam shut.

Finally, the phone stopped ringing, going dark with an abrupt wave of silence.

Right, the angry one said after a moment. Computers up here somewhere. Well get that television downstairs next.

The two men walked back into the hall, moving within an inch of me for the second time. Taking a cue from the invisible watcher Id imagined outside my office door, Id bolted for the hallway itself - not to run down the stairs, which would have creaked and given me away; not down the hall, where I would have run into the two men - no, Id slid right up against the wall right outside the door, hidden in the angling curtain of blackness afforded by the flashlights roving beam. As theyd entered and exited the room, curving around me, theyd literally brushed past, clothing touching clothing - but whichever one it had been, he hadnt noticed.

I could still smell sweat and cigarettes. The foul odor lingered in front of my face.

Without so much as moving my head, I strained my eyes to watch the silhouettes and flashlight beam move down the hall. My will to stay motionless gave out, and I slid back into the room as best I could, just as the beam swept back down the hall - an idle glance back that might have gotten me killed, had they done it a moment earlier.

There was nothing left to do but wait. Eternity, infinity, endless raging fear and torment - it drained me until I was nothing but a shell, listening to my house being ransacked, no longer even energetic enough to fear being discovered. I was alone, drained, and at my wits end - and death might have almost been a welcome relief.

Twenty minutes, they told me later. It was only twenty minutes.

...

The utility repairman was kind enough to come the next day. Once he fixed the box in the yard, I kept everything fully lit, attempting to work despite boundless nervousness and twitch reactions to every little sound in the house. Every so often, I tried to smooth out a new scuff on my nearly-stolen computer monitor - it never worked, but it felt vaguely therapeutic.

The phone rang again just about twilight; I stared at it in muted horror, my entire body filled with the animal urge to flee, but simultaneously paralyzed by the prior nights trauma. Somewhere between those two urges, compromise led me to answer the new number.

Hey, just calling to check up on you, a calming, familiar voice greeted me. Id gone down to the station with the officers, filling out a statement. The policemen had laughed at first, hearing the tale of my misdials, but they respectfully grew quiet when they realized that I was serious.

Thanks I replied, calming down. A creak sounded on the stairs - I jumped, but then shook my head.

Yep, not every day something like this happens around here, the Sergeant said. Youre new to town, I know, I just dont want you worried thisll ever happen again.

Oh, Im not afraid, I lied. Thanks for your concern.

Yep. Oh, we figured out how he had your number. He had a part time with the movers you used. Probably used the job to scope out folks to rob. And you, with that big house, living alone probably seemed like an easy target.

The first voice on the misdial - the memory finally clicked into place. I blinked, feeling strangely violated by the realization that man hed answered when Id called the moving company, seeking their services. Hed been in my house, cataloguing my possessions, eyeing them for later theft

Yep, the Sergeant said again, and I heard him lean back in his creaky leather chair. Just be happy you had that lucky call. Damndest thing Ive ever heard. Someones lookin out for you. These same guys killed a farmer out your way two, three months ago. Went to rob him, but the guy was home. Now we know it was them, theyre going away for sure.

My blood ran cold.

Thanks Sergeant, that makes me feel better, I lied. Why the hell did he have to tell me that?

Sure. Gotta get back to work now, you take care.

I hung up the phone with a shiver.

My eyes traveled to that spot outside my office door, where the angled lamplight still carved that sheer black plane, similar to the one that had hidden me from a roving flashlight and saved my life. I had the strangest notion, again, that someone was standing there in the pitch - unseen - watching me. The sensation of presence, of being watched, grew thicker - anticipatory - almost tangible, as if the invisible observer might suddenly step forward out of the darkness and into reality -

Thanks, I blurted - a single word, a sincere message, spoken before I even realized I was thinking it.

The feeling vanished.

Tilting the lamp, I angled the dark curtain back - but there was nobody there.

Motivated by questing emotion, without verbal thought, I walked down the hall to the room overlooking the backyard. I moved through the darkness unafraid, my target already memorized despite my best attempts at forgetting. Near the window where Id peered out and seen the men breaking in, I opened a box Id left sealed for far too long. The object in question was at the top; I brought it back to my office and set it up on the desk - her picture, facing me. Her face was as bright and cheery as ever, her life still vibrant in frozen sunlight.

I smiled for the first time in several weeks. Living alone? Maybe not so much </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to offer a counter-view to the inevitable flood of sound bites about reading being important.

I make an effort not to read top authors in a genre until *after* I've completed my book.

You can glean plot devices in popular books from tvtropes or asking people who've read the books. Typically, you end up with the basic components and get a good idea of what trending tropes are - *without* compromising your own voice.

Personally, I can't help but absorb the writing styles I'm reading. I read Lovecraft, I lean towards that style without realizing it. In the case of most popular works, this isn't a good thing. Most popular books are at the top for a laundry list of reasons that don't always include 'good writing'. So, I like to stick to my voice and my honed writing skills (practicing writing helps writing as long as you are thinking about what you're doing and trying to improve). After a book is done but before I publish, I'll read those top books and compare styles.

Often, I'm glad I didn't read them beforehand.

But yeah, there are strong gains to be made by reading a few of the other books around yours in your genre. Just read one or two. You don't need to read constantly like some people insist, you just need to get that low-hanging fruit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The unfortunate truth is that one of the variables in the overall evaluation of a work is Money. As a Marketing MBA, I know for a fact that a business can make absolutely anything successful with enough invested marketing dollars.

The upside of that, I believe, is that great writers who write consistently will build up to that virtual investment over time (time = money), so the mass of writers making a living from publishing ebooks will eventually hamper the corporate ability to shove books down the world's throat through advertising.

Twilight, Harry Potter, et al - at the top because someone paid for them to be there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't believe the metrics and tools currently exist for this. The only method I can think of would be testing next-book sales after someone reads a book. If you edit it and next-book sales go up, did you make it better? Maybe. But then, how do you know how many of your sales were from people who read the first book? Amazon is woefully lacking in metrics.

You also can't have the same person read two chapters and vote on it. Their experience is inherently skewed by reading it twice.

What I do is continue to write. If a book sells consistently, I lean toward its style. If a book never sells or gets panned, I lean away from it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All stories exist already in the infinite multiverse of thought. All you have to do is narrow down the coordinates of a particular story by defining variables.

Somewhere there is a character who is taking an action. Who is he, and why is he doing it? What caused him to have those reasons? Answer those questions, and the story will begin to illuminate itself.

He's got 2 or 3 threads filled with gold. Literal. Gold. Everything I would tell you he's probably already said in there. Most importantly: links. You don't need to do *any* marketing aside from your author blog and inter-book links. The work is the marketing.

I'm definitely still writing. It's the career I've always wanted. It's tough to stick to a number of pages or words; I think each person has to find that in their own way. Me, I just get excited by the stories I'm envisioning, and write til I can't anymore. I've averaged anywhere between 500 and 4k words a day on any given month. It just matters that you keep writing.

I have pen names in horror, science fiction, and self-help. They're all weirdly similar genres actually... </TEXT>

And remember, guys. You don't need to make $300,000 a year to be an author, fulfilled, and happy. Make $5k a month and you are still beating the system and saving your life from a cubicle and a commute every day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep!

* Have the characters in mind in general when you start. They will surprise you as you go, but go with what they do as long as it's not out of left field.
* Establish a rhythm of how events unfold for you as an author. This will turn into your voice over the course of many books, and will be what readers unconsciously love. Work on that rhythm until you don't need to 'plan' stories anymore.
* As soon as something feels like it's gone down the 'wrong path' (you should feel it after a paragraph or two) just delete everything back to the last 'correct path' and rewrite it. Seriously, don't be afraid to just junk whole paragraphs. You have to be confident in your ability to produce more of the same, but better.
* If a sentence feels awkward as you're writing it, and you can't figure out how to word it, go back and rewrite its entire paragraph to complete the idea instead.

Those are the important ones I can think of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suggest the opposite opinion. Learn to write well *the first time* at that rate and you've got yourself a career. It's taken me years to work up to 2,000 words an hour without the need for serious editing. You should always go over it and refine it, of course, but creating good habits that result in quality work the first time pays off. Seriously, it will pay you money. You will write five books in the same space that 'five time editor guy' will write one. (Not judging either habit, just depends on your genre, targets, styles, etc, some genres demand perfection to the last detail) </TEXT>

* Their actual words and intonations don't need to be on the page. You can have a whole conversation in a sentence with "they argued in circles for several minutes", for example.

* "Said" is an invisible word, and that's a good thing. As long as the identity of the speaker is clear feel free not to add any descriptive text... just make sure you're aware that it will make a conversation feel faster than otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some alright answers, but the total answer is that your bio-feedback systems are not operating because you're not actually moving.

* You initiate punch movement
* Your spacial-body-awareness sense updates with what should be happening. This is the same system that allows you to know where your arm is without looking.
* You receive no 'impact' or 'moving' sensations in response when your arm should be hitting something

Therefore you feel extremely weak or sluggish. Your body thinks you're punching but the resulting sensory data indicates very little happening </TEXT>

What used to disgust me about 'epic journey' though is not the Hero's Journey itself, but rather that the epic journey is always an unlikely hero from a small village taking a long walk on foot through forests, valleys, mountains, etc through an ancient land filled with decaying magic, random 'cool' encounters, and classic evil empires moving to take over the world.

Surely there must be some other way to make an epic journey? Traffic on the way to the supermarket and so on? :p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another analogy I've always liked is this:
You live in a glass cup. There is water in this cup, and you live on the surface in a little boat.
One day the water's surface suddenly expands into an oval shape instead of a circle.
What's happening? There's no detectable interactions within your universe (the cup), there's nothing creating a force!

But of course, the cup itself is moving. You're just unable to observe that happening because you have the wrong inertial reference frame. Meanwhile, the water continues to be affected by a mysterious force toward one side of the cup, changing the shape of the surface you live on.

At least I think that's how the example goes ;p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to filter writing advice to get the important pieces. Leaving something for a week or longer is simply a gigantic waste of time; however, the important seed in that statement is 'you need to be able to read from the perspective of the reader'.

So, learn to cultivate that ability. Put greater metal emphasis on the *actual words on the page* and envision the story all over again based solely on what you've written. It's a skill you will have to build, but it will save you from 'leaving things for a week' repeatedly and losing months.

Red flags are 'failures of imagination'; i.e. moments when your re-imagining-as-you-read simply fails because something doesn't make sense or something isn't right.

If you get through a reading without any failures of imagination, you're done. The marginal utility of writing a new book has exceeded the marginal utility of re-editing this one yet another time. Go publish this one and use anything you learn from reader reactions and reviews to improve your next book. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> An Impossible Window </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-10-04 23:03:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My grandmother's house was a long, narrow structure typical of an ancient Pittsburgh suburb. It was one room wide throughout, and set among a row of other such houses on a very steep hill. It was robust, but my immigrant grandparents made a home of it. My father grew up there, and my brother and I were taken to visit three or four times a year.

I spent the nights of many family gatherings in a room that felt like a cave. Far at the back of the second floor, it was a perfect hideout once the adults let me escape from dinner. There were old books there, of the kind that can't be found anymore. I read them by the orange glow that filtered in through the blinds of the sole window at the back of the room. It was the muted and soft glow of a streetlight. I often fell asleep to the ethereal sound of passing cars in the night.

As the years passed, I grew older, and books were replaced by video games that I brought from home. My brother joined me, and we took refuge in our cave to escape the younger children and boring adults. We would play in there for hours on a black and white television, once the pride and joy of my grandfather's possessions. Still, that window lent a soft glow to the room that let us turn off the main light and fool the adults into thinking we were asleep while we stayed up and gamed.

We returned there about two years ago to pack the place up and handle the estate. My father was there, his eyes tired. He saw half a century of memories in every room. I can't imagine what he felt. He told us all about the adventures he and his six siblings had had growing up there. He took us to our room at the very back of the second floor, through a long narrow hallway and past all of the other rooms. It was his room that we always took refuge in. He had always secretly enjoyed the fact that my brother and I liked the room, too.

"You know, in all the years we've been coming here, I've never looked out that window," I told him.

"Well, it's our last chance," he replied. "Take a look."

My father walked over to that window and adjusted the blinds. They opened to reveal the Pittsburgh cityscape as it was just starting to glow in the early evening twlight - a beautiful view from high on our hill.

"I grew up with this view," my father mused. "So many younger versions of me looked out this window..."

I joined him at the glass, eyeing the streetlight that had lit so many of my younger adventures. I remembered the view in detail, having peered out many times. My brother, who had somehow never managed to look out the window, immediately looked confused.

"What are we looking at?" he asked, peering over our shoulders.

We looked at him as if he was crazy for a moment.

"This is the back of the house," he explained. "What is that light doing there?"

My father and I looked back out at the same time. I traced the street below, noting parked cars, other houses, and a hill that ran down into distant cityscape. My father shook his head, and ran out of the room. We followed him to the front of the house, where a sole window showed us the exact same scene - except it wasn't. The cars were different. The houses were the same but... different in small ways. The cityscape in the distance twinkled with slightly different patterns. I'd grown up with that back window, taken it for granted...

My father started swearing, and rushed to the back of the house again. We entered the room to find his face pressed against the glass. He peered about wildly, then seemed to fixate on something.

"Dad?!" he shouted. "Dad!"

We ran up to look, and I saw a hand waving up at the window from the street below. As I leaned higher to try to see more, the hand dropped. I caught a glimpse of an old-fashioned hat as its owner approached the house.

"Jesus Christ!" my dad shouted. "Dad, wait!"

He pulled at the window, which seemed to have been painted shut long ago. We helped him, pushing at it, but it refused to budge. In desperation, he wrapped something around his arm and smashed the window. It shattered outward with a crash and the delicate sound of falling glass...

And we peered out onto the backyard and driveway. Broken glass littered the ivy below. My mother was out there, packing things in the van. She looked up at us, surprised.

My father just shook his head, his eyes brimming. The room was dim. The comforting orange glow had vanished.

Though we asked many times, he never spoke of that window again. </TEXT>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle_(marketing)#Product_life_cycle_.28PLC.29

Edit: link is broken by wikipedia's parentheses...

However, eBooks are more like perpetuities. There is no reason why any given eBook can't sell for the rest of time, even unsolicited and unmarketed. I've observed this very phenomenon with some of my own books. Early pen names   genres I started and abandoned a year or two ago are still selling (and even slowly increasing as the number of readers increases) and I've done exactly zero marketing for them.

Another caveat is that higher rankings mean more sales. So, the more you sell, the higher you go, the more you sell. If your eBook isn't a minimally-selling perpetuity, it could follow the alternate curve of an exponential rise. After that it would follow the more traditional product lifecycle phases until many years later it is back to the minimally selling perpetuity level. (assuming you stop producing more content and marketing) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your heart is in the right place but your strategy is wrong. Trapped situations *must* end, and you will not be happy in a loveless marriage.

I think it's a mistake to 'work hard to remove stress from her life'. Doing all that stuff for her is the opposite of what you need to be doing. Keep working out, keep improving your life, and stop pandering to her. She goes part time, she took a month off and then another week off? She's depressed, or a terrible person. It's up to you to figure out which. That doesn't mean it won't change... but she has to do it on her own.

You need to find things in your life to care about and pursue them. Health, career, and so on. Her behavior is **not** acceptable, and she needs to start seeing that you (and everyone else) will leave her behind if she doesn't get her act together.

**edit: Definitely sounds like the medications mentioned below. Have to retract my advice, it won't work for someone who isn't functioning correctly.** </TEXT>

Write small sentences like this one. Imagine somebody else speaking. Choose a friend of yours that isn't as wordy as you are. Write with their voice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right. It's incredibly unfortunate that we, as authors, don't have access to more sales data. I don't know why publishing companies aren't rushing to get this data into our hands. I've had to resort to careful months-long experiments with my own books to figure out what to price in certain categories. Just copying other authors doesn't do you any good, because you can't even tell if they're doing well! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. E-book authors need to realize that they *will* get seen... but as they publish new books, not as they blog or market. It's a tough fact for many to accept: you cannot write that 'one amazing book' and hit it big. You *can* write those **ten** amazing books and hit it big. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 99 cent books, or free books, are marketing inroads to one's online presence. They have to *seriously* hit it big to pay off on their own.

However, they shouldn't be out there in isolation.

**EXAMPLE Strategy:**
You should have at least 10 titles if you plan to be a serious author. This doesn't mean complete books, it just means *titles*... take that as you will. 1 or 2 should be free, 6 or 7 should be 99 cents, and the remaining 1-3 should be your lucrative best work at 2.99.

Why? Because free books dip into a huge pool of readers. 99 cent works bring them in and convince them, as well as reach a separate pool of readers.

Your $2.99 book, at 70% royalty, gets around $2.09. Your 99 cent books, at 30% or 40% royalty, get 30 or 40 cents. Thus each $2.99 book sold can be as much as 5-6 times more profitable than a single 99 cent book.

So you'd have to sell **six times** more books at the 99 cent level than at a $2.99 level. This is simply unreasonable most of the time.

Why don't we price all our books at $2.99? You won't sell massive amounts of books if you don't have marketing inroads - in our case, 99 cent and free books.

Writing more books is the best marketing money can buy for people that aren't already successful. </TEXT>
