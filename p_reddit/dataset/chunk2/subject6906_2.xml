	<TEXT> So he references his academic experience in science as a way to distract the reader from the real issue....Another asshat appears. My question is: How out of touch with reality can you be? 

Theoretical discussions = All talk, No action, avoid real issue. Rinse and repeat. 

This is what happens when your stuck in the realm of academia and it's all you've ever known. When in doubt reference theoretical discussions and research....Some people really do think their impact on society is much bigger than it is (Mr. Markowitz, uhh nobody cares.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> History has a tendency to repeat itself. It sucks. And you're correct that narrative holds true through out all generations. The one thing that seems to be different is how much power and influence the media has on the formulation of thought. The formulation of organic thought is tough, especially, when the media (all sides) tries to manipulate the formulation of thought. 

A new generation has been exposed to the internet, social media, and smartphones since birth....while we may be repeating the process as humans, something is surprisingly different about the way people internalize information.  Manipulation of the masses is a real concept. Everytime we see people flip out on social media and spew anger everywhere...that's a new way of how we deal with information. We express ourselves more openly and have more platforms do so.   Overall there will always be problems created by another generation that will be left for future generations (to solve). 

Every administration has people who resign and do questionable shit. It boils down to what people view as more convenient to their interests and priorities. 

data might be beautiful, but there also many ways to fudge the numbers, omit information, and make correlations that don't inherently infer causation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The media keeps saying this whole Flynn scandal is the worst since Watergate. However, as someone said earlier and corrected me on...Nixon was never impeached. He would have if he didn't resign.

	<TEXT> I'm completely neutral in this issue. I just think that its important to wish your president well and hope he does the right thing. That's all. Politicians in general do terrible things, but you'll never hear about it because of the layers of guise of authority to which they hide behind.

I hate to see all of the infighting in this country....and sadly enough, I think people get their rocks off by seeing it happen. Confirmation bias is absolutely present on both sides, but when are people going to realize that constant fighting isn't going to solve anything. It's only going to mess the country up for future generations.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The media has a huge presence in this country. And if the media outlets could have full control over the US, they would do it in a heartbeat. Sadly enough, many millennials believe a lot of opinion pieces crafted by spin doctors (This goes both ways). 

Here are two examples of president's and their impeachments: 

Richard Nixon - Watergate: Several campaign officials from the RNC broke into DNC headquarters and stole documents...to try to dig up dirt on their political opponents.

Bill Clinton (Husband of Hillary Clinton) - Had sexual relations with a Whitehouse intern named Monica Lewinsky. Finger-banged her with a cigar in the Oval Office and lied under oath about it (perjury).  He was impeached, but remained in office. However, he was disbarred and could no longer practice law. 

Simply put, many millennials don't know what it takes to get impeached. The media hopes Trump will get impeached, which is why the term is being thrown around. 

The days of organic thought are over. It's extremely hard to locate the facts and ONLY the facts without someone giving their analysis on them. 

EDIT: Thank you fellow reddit user. Nixon was not impeached, but would have been if he didn't resign. His actions proved to be an action that was considered an impeachable offense.

	<TEXT> Use njtransfer.org and your CC's course evaluation to see what matches up. Remember, you can transfer into an instate school with an associates degree....AND all credits will be taken by the receiving university, IF  all courses satisfy the articulation agreement between both the sending and receiving schools. 

LAMPITT LAW:
https://www.middlesexcc.edu/transfer-services/the-lampitt-law-a-comprehensive-state-wide-transfer-agreement/

Business courses are evaluated separately. It's a bureaucratic thing because the Business School is it's own animal. lol  Be very careful about the business courses you plan to take.

	<TEXT> Go to the press. No college wants bad publicity...usually they fold like cheap wallets. They are scared of issues hurting the school's image. Nobody likes when he or she is outed AND held accountable for their actions.  Also, as a side note....clearly some of these people have overbearing huburis where they don't feel the need to admit wrong doing. It's unprofessional and hypocritical. Get this asshat off the state payroll.  </TEXT>
