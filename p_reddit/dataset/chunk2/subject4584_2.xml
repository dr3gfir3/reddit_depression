	<TEXT> Butter here is pretty standard, but I stock up when it goes down on sale. Butter freezes well, so I never pay over $1.49 a lb. for it. Our state has price protections on diary, so it can't go too low. I've never seen milk on sale as cheap as some people get it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Upwork is weird. I have a friend who did a long-term low-paying project for someone, and when she tried to quit because she had something better paying, he asked her what she wanted, and gave it to her. Sometimes, you have to earn your dues there. I don't like that. I'd rather knock out a couple of low-paying mill jobs and be done with it than get stuck doing regular low-paying work in hopes of getting more "eventually." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I noticed this at Save-a-lot last time I brought a family pack. I got two meals out of one breast. This is how they grow them, though. I used to live in a state that grew a lot of fryers, and the chickens are so front-heavy, they can't fly or sometimes even stand. The bigger the breasts, the more they sell for, since it's the most popular meat on the bird. I prefer legs myself, but even those are completely oversized. I usually put 4 legs in a qt. size ziploc to freeze them, but sometimes I can only get 3 in there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That doesn't always work. When my son was born, I had a c-section and an outrageous bill. They took advantage of my ignorance of how to negotiated terribly and were very hard to deal with.  This was 30 years ago. I made $7 an hour as a single mother, and they wanted me to pay them $250 a month. The only other option they gave me was to sign a voluntary judgment, which I refused to do. They refused to budge. I talked to a lwyer, and he threatened to sue them because when spinal fluid was leaking out of my spine due to their botched spinal block, and I had horrible spinal headaches, they tried to give me codeine, which I'm allergic to (big red letters across the top of my chart) and also refused to tell me about a 5-minute procedure called a blood patch that stopped the pain immediately. A resident who came in to see me told me about it, and he did it. There were other things too. He threatened to sue, my bill went away. </TEXT>

Noticed produce is more expensive now too, and every week, I see more non-food items advertised than food items. They still have some good buys, don't get me wrong, but this is a huge increase for a new store.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Save that article and sell it elsewhere, but FIRST run it through copyscape for a week to make sure he hasn't published it. That is a common scam on some sites to post a long article with great pay, then reject it and publish anyway, in effect stealing your work. If it's been stolen, go the DMCA route first. If that doesn't work, find out who his hosting provider is and turn him in for plagiarism. If he has ads on his page, go to them and tell them he is a plagiarist and ask them to remove their ads from that site. If he has Adsense, Google has a form you can fill out. I've had to do this a few times, but I don't just do like most people do and walk away. I go after them big time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sick of people acting like freelance writing is some hobby that people do for the fun of it. I've turned down three jobs in the last month because they refused to sign a contract. I try to explain that I'm a business person, that this is my business, but for some reason, the word "freelance" makes them not take me seriously. I actually had one say "Oh, I thought you were freelance." I wanted to say "Do you have a dictionary?" I guess I'm just supposed to trust them to pay me when they say they will, right? Wrong.

I've also been trying to hire someone to write some blog articles for me. I asked for a resume. One said "I don't want to send a resume, I work under a pseudonym." WHAT??? I blame this on the PayPal rule that if you don't make $20,000 a year or have 200 transactions, you don't get a 1099. Evidently, everyone just wants to work under the table and not pay taxes. Do they not realize that the IRS can find out that you're doing this? Heard about someone last year who got audited by the IRS and they made him give them all his PayPal statements for the year. Found out he had only reported half his freelance income, and now he's in deep doo-doo. 

One said "What do you need a resume for?" I just didn't even answer. 

I work so hard for my money, and I run my business like any other sole proprietorship, which means I need a contract and I need resumes and I need you to act like you would if you were applying at a brick-and-mortar business. You surely wouldn't walk into a store and say "I need you to hire me, but I don't want to fill out an application or even give you my name and I want to work only under the table." 

I know Reddit has a lot of really young people on it, but this is ridiculous! If you want a job, act like a grown up living in a grown-up world.

	<TEXT> Been there, done that. Bubblews, Mahalo, Examiner, Bright Hub...need I go on? Anyone who has been doing this for any length of time knows this business model never lasts. After the Angel Investor money runs out, they either cut pay drastically, stop paying you altogether, or just shut down and don't pay you. Or they do like Examiner did and lock you out in the middle of the night, change the rules that said the work belonged to you, and steal all your work and your original photos. 

Look, if you have a ton of social media friends, and you can get them to give you clicks, fine. Ride the horse until it drops, but remember -- it WILL drop, so have another horse ready to ride off on. In other words, don't make this the only egg in your basket. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Been there, done that. Can you say "Bubblews?" Thing was, most of the views came from peers, who didn't click ads, and after the original angel investor money was gone, people stopped getting paid. I've seen this happen over and over again; Examiner, Bright Hub, Mahalo --- should I go on? I've been writing online for 8 years, and this model never works for very long. Never. They always have to drop pay, then they lose their best writers. First, they say you retain copyright to your work, then they change the rules in the middle of the night, lock you out, and steal your work (Mahalo and Examiner both did this).

If you want some fast money while they are still paying, go for it, but don't count on it lasting. Ride that horse until it drops, then get off and have another horse saddled up to take you on ahead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Writers Domain is not taking applications. Writer Access is hard to break into, and don't know if they are still taking apps. Constant Content is writing on spec, but you can make decent money there with private requests once you get established. I don't know much about Zerys, but I hear it pays well, but doesn't have much work. Crowd Content is somewhat strange, although some people love it. Work there is sporadic unless you're put onto teams, and most teams aren't worth what they pay you.

As for Textbroker, there are people making amazing money there. If you go onto the forums, you will see that teams and direct orders are how to make good money on TB. I used to be on a team that paid .08 a word, and I made a lot of money on it. You can charge whatever you want for direct orders. I use it as a back-up and fill-in site for times when work elsewhere is slow or for days I need $10 more to fill out my quota. It's not a bad place, and $400-500 a month is definitely possible there in time. When I worked it full-time I was pulling in around $500 a week, and I wasn't on any special teams at the time, and I've never had a direct order. It was just choosing easy topics and writing fast.

I'd go with tutoring, though. There are online sites where you can tutor via a skype-like interface and there are also sites like Udemy where you can put up tutorials and have people pay for them.

	<TEXT> Free always works. Everybody wants something for free. IMHO, newsletters are the best way to maintain regular contact with subscribers and optins. My favorite newsletter is one for gardening that has recipes, how-tos, and coupons, along with a free something every month, like last month it was a free ebook of all the recipes from last year. You can't just toss out one freebie then spam people to death. The newsletters I sign up for that end up being a spamfest of offers I did not sign up for get unsubscribed and I will never buy from them. I don't believe in spamming people daily because they signed up for a weekly/monthly newsletter. To me, that's just common sense, but a lot of marketers will tell you different.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with this, but you can do it all under one domain if you're careful. I used to have a blog that had four loosely related topics, and each was a subdomain; however, the main site was just basically a landing page with links to the other blogs. I called it a mini blog network, because there was the possibility of always adding more topics. The way I differentiated them was to give them all their own names and themes. At the time, I was doing this on Blogger as bum marketing, and each subdomain was actually a separate blog. 

I don't know if that makes sense, but say the name was Joe's Iowa Homestead and the four other blogs were Joe's DIY, Joe's Garden, Joe's Animals  and Joe's Great Outdoors. Each blog would have a separate client base and separate marketing, yet they all tie back in to the main blog, which has blurbs with links leading to the specific blogs, plus general posts about homesteading in Iowa. So they are all different, but all connected. I guess you could call these "sister blogs," but I tend to think of sister blogs as being on unrelated topics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you write in AP style? How do you propose to get paid, since most people want to pay by PayPal and you must be 18 to get a PayPal account. I do know teens who have accounts under their parents' names on some content mills and get paid through their PayPal account. Payment is going to be your biggest problem. If you can write, you can find people to buy it. Never accept checks or money orders. Too many scammers out there. 

My advice is to find local businesses that have neglected blogs or that could use a blog and sell your services there. That way, you can get checks, have your parents sign for you to open a checking account, and get paid like that. Or they can pay you cash, which has obvious advantages. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> HEAR! HEAR! I agree with you 100%. The dems were as complicit in the destruction of working class jobs as the repubs, and it didn't start with NAFTA. It started long before that, when we were buying tons of Japanese steel and putting thousands of small farmers out of business. This goes way back to the Carter administration, and it was a whisper in the wind even before that. We knew it was happening. We did nothing. Instead, we made trade deals like NAFTA, purportedly to make the electronics and auto industry competitive with Japanese imports, when all we had to do was put limits and tariffs on those imports to make them less appealing. Then the other industries said "What about us? I need to be able to get cheaper labor too!" and we let them move to China. Then tech said "Hey, we need cheaper labor," so we let them bring in workers from Asia and displace American workers. Are you aware that Bill Gates threatened to take his company to Canada if we didn't give him more guest worker visas? Did we say "Would you like me to help you pack your smarmy ass and get the fuck out of the country that made you rich?" NO, we changed the laws so that all companies could bring in more visa workers. 

Dems let their Wall Street buddies get away with literal grand theft in the very, very, illegal and immoral mortgage debacle, because they needed their money. Plus, if they banks fell, their stock portfolios might be harmed, and they would not have that money to draw on for reelection.

But it's not only the politicians, it's all of us who stood by and became complacent, turned out heads and our backs on the poor, and refused to see what was right in our faces. It was too painful to look. We were not at the breaking point yet.

The Tea Party, which we chose to ignore as "ignorant racists" was formed because those people had had their jobs, their livelihoods, and their dignity stolen from the people who were getting rich off of them. We joked about them as they slowly built themselves up by getting into positions on city and county governments, taking over state legislatures and governor's mansions. 

The saddest part is, in all of this, there was an entire generation growing up watching us not give a shit about whether their parents lost their jobs, or they had to move out of the houses they had grown up in and move in to a motel room or live in their cars. Instead, we allowed them to cut more funds for low income housing, putting even more people out into the streets. We didn't care when cuts in food stamps and school lunch and breakfast programs left them hungry and sick and unable to learn. They watched and they grew to hate us all. And we did nothing. We stood by doing nothing while this generation lost parents, family and friends to needless wars, while the military/industrial machine raked in trillions of their parents hard earned money.

These are Trumps's people. I'm one of them, although I didn't vote for him. They are angry and our arrogance and greed is to blame. I have long said that GREED  and GREED ALONE is what killed the middle class, not the GOP, just GREED on both sides, across the spectrum. 

And we sat back and watched it happen, and turned our heads to homeless families on the street, and the most egregiously arrogant and entitled of us passed laws to punish them for being homeless so we didn't have to have our failures staring us in the face every day.

We are just as complicit as the Republicans, because we made empty promises and did nothing. 

I also agree that we have to stop making excuses for Obama. He was a weak president, who did not fight hard enough for us. He could have rallied people to fight congress, but he didn't. He had that power. He could have made a call to arms to get us to where we are now, but he didn't. IMHO, his legacy is one of apathy when the people he was supposed to be leading were suffering.

Remember, we are the compassionate party. Let's make that work for us. The best thing you can do is VOLUNTEER for service organizations and actually go out into the neighborhoods and help people one-on-one.

DO NOT ignore young people! There are a lot of hungry, down and out college students who need help too, struggling to get an education, going to class hungry, living on the streets. We need to start foundations to help them pay for college so they aren't saddled with so much student debt, because you just KNOW the GOP is going to cut funding for student aid and force them to borrow from their banking overlords. 

WE CAN DO THIS! WE ARE MIGHTY! Never forget the words of Maya Angelou, 

I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.

We lost the millenials in the general because they did not feel like we cared about their issues. Trump has proven one thing to us -- and it's something Oprah Winfrey said long ago -- people just want to be ACKNOWLEDGED. 

Face to face, hand to hand, heart to heart -- get out there and ACKNOWLEDGE THEM!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may not actually be a bad thing. Trump is right now surrounded by people who would take advantage of his ignorance and naivete when it comes to running the country. He is so easily swayed by anyone who sucks up to him. I think Jared is there to keep that from happening. Ivanka seems to be pretty level-headed most of the time, and she isn't as radical as her father is, so maybe her husband can guard against having Trump led in the wrong direction and keep the wolves at bay. 

Unless he is one of the wolves. I have a strange feeling that his kids are going to try to steal his company from him, which probably wouldn't be a bad thing. </TEXT>
