	<TEXT> Well I didn't think I'd be back so soon but I'm at home and have a free night, so after all your comments on my last story I figured why not.

So back to sitting at the locksmith shop.

We have a customer(or rather HAD a customer), he's a contractor that has probably close to a hundred padlocks on various tools and buildings, and we get to work on every single one that breaks. 

He's got most of them on a master key system, for those if you that don't know, that means he's got several padlocks with one key, several with another key, and several with another, and he has one key that works all of them.

Now he's a regular, he comes in at least a couple times a month either needing a new lock(s), needing a broken one fixed, or he has some other problem. Let's call him T. He's probably in his 60s, big strong guy, worked his whole life.

One time he came in because he couldn't get his key to work in his lock. Everybody else could open it, with his key or their own, but he couldn't. I tried it and it worked perfectly, I closed it and opened it probably a dozen more times right in front of him, then handed it to him and he couldn't get it open no matter what. 

I noticed he was a lefty, so I told him to try switching hands. He looks at me like I'm insane and asks why, and I take it and use my left hand to open it, and no matter how hard I try, I can't open it. I switch hands, opens perfectly.

I hand it back, he switches hands, and it opens. He looks at me and disbelief and just when I think he's about to thank me and leave, he tells me to fix it so he doesn't have to switch hands.

Honestly I thought that was kinda lazy but whatever, the customer's always right. So I take it and say sure, I'll do what I can. I pull it apart and reassemble it, and that seems to fix whatever the problem is, so I let him try it and he's happy. 

Then T asks me if I can get him a set of 6 more padlocks like that, keyed to his master and their own keys. I tell him I'll look in the back to see if we have any in stock.

Right about this time the phone rings, so I answer it and a lady's locked out of her car with her 2 year old inside. It's not far, only a couple blocks, so I tell her I'll be there in a few minutes. This is last May in Oklahoma, so the weather's starting to get pretty hot. 

I tell T that we only have 4 locks in stock and we'll have to order the rest, but they'll be here in a couple days. The rest of the conversation goes a bit like this:

 T: Well you can go ahead and get the 4 you have ready for me, I'll wait on them.

 M: Well normally I would but a lady just called and I have to go get her car open, I'll be back in 10-15 minutes if you want to come back?

 T: Are you saying I have to leave?

 M: Well, yes. It's an emergency and her kid is locked inside, and my dad's out of town on another job right now.

He looks at me like I just took his favorite teddy bear and set it on fire in front of him, his eyes are red and I can see tears welling up

 T: So you're saying that you're going to make me leave and come back another day to get these, even though you have them in the back?

 M: Yes, I am. It's going to take a good 10 minutes apiece to do those, and I have to go right now because it's an emergency where someone could be in danger, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.

He picks up his fixed lock and leaves, slams the door, and I've never seen him again.

Got the kid out of the car though, so at least that went well. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> "You can't un-cut keys, ma'am" </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I'm a locksmith, I both go out on calls and stay at our shop where we sell locks, keys, safes, all kinds of stuff. It's just me and my dad that work here.

This happened a few years ago but you usually remember the really fun customers. We were doing some cleanup around the shop when a middle aged woman comes in and slams a (rather expensive) key down and says she wants to return it. CL for crazy lady and M for me

 M: "Is there a problem with it?"

 CL: "No, you made this key for me when I lost my car keys last month, but I found my keys so I don't need this one anymore"

 M: "I'm sorry but if there's nothing wrong with the key we can't refund you."

I said it was an expensive key earlier, it was for a mid-2000s Mitsubishi, and it had a remote head. The chip keys we sell are $20 plus programming, and the remote heads are more depending on the make/model of the car. If I remember correctly her key was around 80 for the key itself, not counting the service charge to go make it when she lost hers. Total cost was somewhere around 220, which she wanted the full refund of for whatever reason.

 CL: "Well can't you just un-cut the key and sell it to someone else?"

 M: "No ma'am, we can't un-cut keys. Plus it's been programmed to your car so we couldn't reuse it anyway."

 CL: "Go get your manager so I can speak with him"

My dad is around the corner in the back room and heard the whole thing, so as she said this he poked his head around the corner with a chipper "Hi! What can I do for you?"

He then gives the same answers, pretty much word for word, until she's visibly angry that we won't give her 200 bucks

 CL: "is the owner here? I'm not leaving without some kind of refund"

My dad's more amused than irritated by this point so he just says "Sure, let me get him for you" and heads into the back.

He's back there for a few seconds, then he pokes his head around the corner, this time wearing his reading glasses, and says "Hi! What can I do for you?"

 CL, fuming now: "Do you think I'm an idiot?"

Me internally: "yes, a little bit"

Me externally: "No, not at all. Unfortunately neither of the three of us will be unable to give you a refund though, seeing as it's been over 30 days and there's no actual issues with the key. I'm sorry we couldn't help you any further."

 CL: "Well I hope you're happy that you just lost a customer"

Then she leaves, forgetting to pick up her key sitting on the counter. About 5 minutes later she walks back in without saying a word, picks up the key, and leaves. But not before my dad chimed in with a "have a nice day!"

TL;DR: lady wants a refund on a key we made for her because she found her old ones, she can't understand that we can't un-cut keys and gets mad.

Edit: I have more stories, a couple more from the shop, but a few from going out on calls too. I'll share if you're interested, not sure of the mods would be cool with the service call stories though

Edit 2 because some people can't seem to grasp that both services and goods cost money:

Service call = $40, this is the basic local "gas and services" charge. An extra $10 is added on for every 10 miles away, so her total service call was 50

Fitting a key to a car when they've lost it = $35 usually, and this involves either peeking inside the lock and reading the pins, or taking apart the lock. In this case it was the latter, so we're charging for time spent also.

Key programming = $40, this is a set price because some cost more, some cost less, and we only charge to program keys that require us to hook up our machine(which by the way costs several thousand dollars, plus several hundred per year) to their car.

And then there's the price of the key itself, which I mentioned at the beginning of the post.

So yup, sorry if you can't grasp that things aren't free </TEXT>

And honestly I like shorter stuff too, I wasn't expecting this to turn out as long as it did but I didn't want to abandon it. And I'll keep that in mind about the cuts, it crossed my mind that it might be too much but more opinions always helps </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the advice, I knew I made a couple mistakes in the name and a couple in the quote but I didn't want to lose all of it just for that so I just rolled with it. 
For the "ou" in "You", I wasn't quite sure how to write it since there wasn't a character for ou in this English mode, so I just assumed wrote it phonetically, with the hard "oo".

As for the spacing, I was trying to write somewhat in the black speech/ring inscription style, where there's only space between sentences and the words flow together, but I'll definitely work on my spacing, both in this style and in the normal style. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Late to the party but here's a thing I made with a couple friends a while back. Wrote a script I thought was kinda funny, decided to film it to see how it worked. The audio is bad since we don't have any real equipment, but I've got a ton of dumb sketches like this and serious short stories I'd like to eventually film.
