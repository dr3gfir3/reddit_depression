	<TEXT> There's a full on propaganda campaign to protect the swamp from being drained. They're brainwashing people (mostly liberals) into seeing Trump as a bad guy and the political establishment as the good guys. So long as enough of us refuse to buy into propaganda we will remain a free society, but some ugly times in history have started out the same way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is my system using its full potential?

I built my new computer a couple of weeks ago using 6700K CPU and 1070 GPU. The parts website suggested the system would pull 110W-389W, so I chose a 650W PSU to be safe. Instead the system only uses 30W most of the time, and maybe 130W during high performance tasks.

I've run benchmarks and they say the components are delivering the expected high scores, and games run perfectly, but it seems odd that such little power is being consumed. Did I misread the power estimates and 110W is actually the estimated wattage under load? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Screwing up established history is worse than continuing the existing narrative. TNG/DS9/VOY were popular shows that shared a common time period. They could continue from there, or advance a few decades. What made those shows popular is that they were a calm, uplifting look at a fictional future in which all of the world's problems have been solved and now people are out exploring the mysteries of space. They inspired real changes in attitudes, new technologies and scientific theories. The more recent stories are just copying things that already exist now in an attempt to seem cool and cutting edge. No one cares about a gay or transgendered crew member. We want to be inspired about the distant future. </TEXT>

 "I just spoke with both Silverstone and APC. Silverstone is going to get back to me on this question, but APC was pretty clear -- they strongly felt that PFC power supplies should use true sine wave UPSs. They told me that the reason for this was because PFC power supplies require a much faster changeover time when the battery kicks in, and that due to the design of stepped sine wave UPSs, they were not always fast enough to satisfy the power supply. This could lead to the PSU shutting down when the battery tried to kick in. The guy I spoke with said that the stepped sine wave wouldn't "damage" the PSU, but that it simply might not work, and that if it DID work, it might not "always" work. Apparently it depends on the specific power supply." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So if a court can prove that you incite imminent lawlessness by falsely shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, it can convict you. If you incite an unlawful riot, your speech is "brigaded" with illegal action, and you will have broken the law. But merely falsely shouting "fire" does not break the law, even if it risks others safety.


It sounds like the first amendment does not protect speech which causes a panic and leads to lawless action. Presumably this applies to the press also. </TEXT>
