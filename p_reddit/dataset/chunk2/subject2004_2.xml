	<TEXT> Some guys play to the talent level that they're surrounded by. My best friendnever played organized basketball, he played at an average level any time we went to a basketball camp. Then when I went to college he'd come play and torch everyone. It made no sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a Lakers fan, but I honestly think you guys can beat Cleveland. Turner matches up really well with Thompson. LeBron and PG will pretty much cancel each other out offensively. You'll have some work to do with Kyrie, but if the Pacers can steal one at Cleveland it's wide open. Please win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I grew up in the country, crows are assholes. I've seen them attack kittens and peck their eyes out then just fly off. Hawks will steal babies too but usually they go for squirrels, bunnies, etc. I think crows just do it for entertainment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just had to kill a baby dove yesterday, because a crow destroyed it's nest and knocked it out of the tree. Mom was nowhere to be found, so I sat with him for an hour, petting him and letting him look at it sky, probably wondering what the hell he did to get into this mess and why there was something 500x his size holding him. 

He had one feather, sticking straight out of his head. Poor dude. But he had no food to eat and no family, so he would have starved to death or been killed by fire ants, a crow or a cat. So I wrapped him up in a bag, and ended his life with a brick. Then I sat in the back yard and reflected on how nature doesn't give a fuck about anything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People tend to forget that their favorite or least favorite athletes are still normal people when they aren't on TV, in terms of daily lives with family. This is a pretty humanizing picture. </TEXT>
