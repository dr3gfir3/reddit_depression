	<TEXT> Does anyone else see the resemblance between the shape and design of the fishtank and cells the captives are kept in? Eerily similar.

	<TEXT> One thing I haven't seen many touch in on this topic is how is it that he hears the events of his NDE just prior to experiencing it? When he sneaks into HAPS office and listens to a cd labeled HOMER, he hears "Stop right there!" and the clanging noises of a chase just as it happens in the NDE. Has he been having this NDE over and over but forgetting it because of the gas each time?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, if you notice in the snap chat message the sender at the top of the phone is labeled "lostboy". What's up with that? Does he have Steve labeled as Lostboy? </TEXT>
