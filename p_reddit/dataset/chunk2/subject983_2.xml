	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking to get a nice cymbal pack to upgrade from my ZBTs.  Right now the hats just aren't cutting it for me, they just don't sound good at all. Too high pitched.  I have a 20" ride, 18" china, 16" crash and the 14" hats.  I'm really happy with the sound of the two crashes, and the ride is good for what its worth, although if the pack came with a ride I would have no objection to upgrading.  The two main things I want from the kit would be a new set of hats and a larger crash, preferably 18+ inches. I've been browsing guitar center for their cymbal packs, but I don't know which brands/product lines (Zildjian K or A for example) would sound best for metal.

EDIT: Also someone near me is selling used axis AL2 longboards double pedal for $300.  Should I buy them or no?

	<TEXT>  Button up your shirts that have buttons, this includes flannels. How Clothes Should Fit might be a good read for you. Colors should be coordinated but not matching completely. Dark denim or khaki pants are always a safe bet.

Looking through the guide I saw nothing that would help with flannels. Any specific section I should look at?

And in regards to number two, you want a flat or slightly rounded bottom on the shirts for untucked right?

I always though chinos were more dressy, but its probably due to my lack of expertise in the fashion field.

	<TITLE> Help with outfits for College </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-07-19 22:08:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm starting community college in about a month, and want to get my shit together fashion wise.  As of now my wardrobe mainly consists of jeans, cargo shorts, a pair of cargo pants, lots of athletic shorts and a pair of khakis for pants, and some polo's for work and a bunch of plain crew tees that are either college or high school shirts, or graphics tees.  I think part of the reason I had a rough start in high school is my look just wasn't there, and so I would like to change that for college. I've been reading through the sidebar links and a few questions come to mind.  All of the advice I'm asking for for the rest of this post is in regards to daily wear, not for parties or nicer occasions. 

Firstly, what shirts can I wear besides a V-neck for a casual look? Almost all the guides on the sidebar as well as user posts recommend solid color V's.  I have no problem with this, but to me it just seems like there is no variety there and things would get stagnate as it were over a long period of time. For my pants I namely wear jeans and cargo shorts in the fall and mostly jeans or khakis in the winter. 

Secondly, what would you say the dressiest I should go? I want to have a fashionable look but not look out of place. When I was looking through the basic wardrobe they listed a lot of polo's and dress shirts, but for whatever when I wear polo's or dress shirts I look really professional and not so much the more relaxed look I'm going for. Part of it might be my jeans fit, as they are too big right now as well as boot cut, but I'm planning on fixing that soon.  

Third question is in regards to pants.  I know jeans are good for sure.  However, upon reading the side links I had a few questions.  One, in the basic wardrobe they say no cargo shorts.  As this is my primary form of shorts atm I have to ask why? Jorts, yay or nay? I'm kind of a big shorts guy and upon seeing no cargo shorts, along with the fact that athletic shorts are out for obvious reasons, what does this leave me with in regards to shorts? Or am I going to mostly be operating on long pants from this point on.  This kind of goes back to question two, but are khakis too dressy for a regular day at community college?

Fourth question is how should a hoodie fit? I live in Illinois there will be some days that it will be pretty chilly out.  This wasn't in the comprehensive fitting guide hence my question. Or if you have any other suggestions for a top layer I would be interested to hear those. 

Lastly, how should a flannel fit and how should it be incorporated into the wardrobe. Buttoned up or open? And if open, how should the colors of the flannel weave in with the color of the base shirt; Complement or contrast? 

For reference, I'm about 6 feet tall, about 160 lbs, shoe size 10 1/2, pant size 32/32.  


Thanks guys.

	<TEXT> I normally eat a huge bowl of cereal for breakfast (Raisin Bran or Basic 4 with soy milk), for lunch if I'm working that day a turkey sub sandwich with chips, if not pasta, some frozen meat that I'll cook (chicken wings etc) or some other wheat based meal, along with a side of pretzels, chips or some other snack food.  For dinner if we are eating at home its usually some sort of meat (Chicken breast, pork, ribs), side of salad, as well as some other side such as pasta or rice. 

Based on what you said I'm probably way under-consuming on protein.  
Also just for reference, I wasn't only doing those lifts but depending on the day we would have a bunch of dumbbell stuff life triceps extensions, curls, military press, dumbbell bench and incline bench, bent over rows and fly's. Not sure if I should just focus on the big power lifts or incorporate some of these; I'll check out those two programs you recommended in a bit, but I have to leave for my drum lesson in a few so I don't have time to look at those atm. 

Someone in school said that I may not have been gaining that much muscle because I have a high metabolism.  Is this fact or some made up BS?

EDIT: Thought I should add some stuff about me.  Male, weigh about 160lbs atm, 6ft tall, age 19.  Current Max on bench is 130, squat max is about 155 I think, deadlift is around 185, clean is only like 95.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Questions about working out  </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-07-05 17:31:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a quick question for you guys about reasonable progress and how much gain I should be seeing in my lifts. Over a 6 month period of lifting at school, I only gained about 10-15 pounds in my lifts for bench and incline bench, front/back squats, jerks, and power clean.  The only lift I saw somewhat decent progress in was deadlift, and I went up about 30 pounds in it.  The reason I'm disappointed about these gains is that my gains were very low in comparison to the other people I was working out with; most of them had gains more than double of mine.  I was on a caloric surplus everyday and had a 25g protein bar after most workouts.  

The workout pattern for the major lifts was as follows:

Monday: Squat and Deadlift

Tuesday: Bench

Thursday: Front Squat and Clean 

Friday: Incline Bench and Jerks

Can anyone explain to me what I may have been doing wrong or other things I can do to improve my progress? I've kind of given up on working out simply because I never see any gains and its disheartening to be spending about an hour per day working out and seeing barely any gains.  </TEXT>

you have to turn your volume up quite a bit to hear the ringing-you can hear it the best on the first and second closes of the hat. </TEXT>

In my opinion one should never have an abortion.  That being said, that is my personal belief and it is not in my rights to try to force said view onto others in regards to having it enacted as legislation.  From a legal standpoint I would see it as abortions should be legal where there is some complicating factor (Health of the mother, health of fetus, other family conditions, etc.) but not in the case of "Oh I'm simply not ready for a child".   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I may provide an interjection here, I believe that the word marriage is truly just for Christianity.  I am all for gay "marriage", but my problem comes from calling it marriage.  While you bring up a valid point that it has been an evolving concept for ages, Christians coined the term "Marriage" around the 12-13th century to mean a relationship between a man and a woman.  Now over the years, as we have come into contact with more cultures and the English language has spread, there was a need to translate between languages, and because it was the most similar to other languages word for a relationship between two people marriage was chosen to be said word.  So overtime there has formed sort of a confusion around the word and whether it means a man and a woman or a same sex relationship has been clouded.  In my personal belief, "Marriage" should be completely out of government and replaced with "Civil Union" because there is no religious affiliation with it.  Gay people would be able to get married, however, if a church would preform the service for them.  

tl:dr: "Marriage" should be a contract between two partners and God (Gay or Straight) while all unions should be "civil unions" under the law.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had the HTC HD2, arguably one of the most customizable phones out there, and I just got sick of the hassle of modding after a bit.  For example with MGLDR, I couldn't charge the phone with the phone off, which over time resulted in decreased battery life.  Certain apps wouldn't work or even show up in the market because of the current ROM, resulting in the hassle of upgrading the ROM. Input lag was another huge problem.  Some games would be unplayable because there would be a one second delay between my gesture and when it was actually executed on screen. Unfortunately the connector that connects the touchscreen to the main board broke and the touch screen no longer functions on mine (I was hoping to get it to last until Jelly Bean was announced so I could decided whether to get the Galaxy 3 or iPhone 4s). Now keep in mind this phone was never meant to run android so that may be a source of some of the problems I was having, but so far my experience with android hasn't been great.
