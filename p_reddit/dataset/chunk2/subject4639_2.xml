	<TEXT> There have been a good number of comedy TV shows lasting multiple seasons.  So theoretically, it should be easy for them to make a single 1.5 hour movie?  But that almost never happens.  I'm watching an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia that brings this up.  Why is it they can produce 8x ~20 minute episodes that are hilarious, but it's so hard to create a ~85 minute movie that's worth a damn? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lots of people don't like Peter King, but I enjoy regularly reading his MMQB and Tuesday followup.  Though I often skim large chunks when I can tell he's about to go on a wank-fest or what have you.

And having said that, I've read his columns for many years...and except for games that may have ended 6-3 or something like that, and even then, I'm pretty sure this is the first time that not even a single WORD about the Monday Night game was mentioned in his Tuesday column.

I think it's because we get called fair-weather fans frequently, and granted we do have a good amount of those in house.  Hell I've bitched about the Chargers on /r/nfl plenty. 

So I'm just wondering what positive changes we can take to finally get some attention when we deserve it.  Even when we were Super Bowl contenders, almost no one talked about us at all.  

Thoughts on how we could improve this situation?  I almost never use my Twitter account, but I just sent out two tweets towards King about not getting coverage because dammit.  And I notice in /r/NFL I often see Chargers comments only at the very end of a given thread.  So we could do a better job of upvoting each other (while hopefully avoiding the "seahawks circlejerk" phenomena of only being able to reply to a comment by making a vague reference to our own team)...

I dunno.  I'm just tired of having so little response to games like this.  Maybe somehow we as fans can do a better job of bringing attention to the team by being more active on social media and whatnot, or something?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gonna do a quick paraphrasing before getting to the gist of the matter, and sorry, this might sound a bit rambling but there *is* a point, I swear it -

He talks about the difference between the "Mundane" and the "SF" (Speculative Fiction, not Science Fiction) worlds.  He uses Hugo Weaving (you know the main baddy from the Matrix) as an example first, how he did lots of "Mundane" work (plays, artsy films, etc) and was very popular in that world, but really became *popular* popular once he entered into the SF world.  

Now the relevant parts, and I'm not going to write the entire essay but just some select quotes - 

**Vegging out and Geeking out**

[paraphrasing] We know what vegging out means.  We just want to put something on and not think about it too much and let it wash over us.  Geeking out is when our intelligences are put to a test and we actually think about what we're watching.  Many of the best movies/books/TV Shows/etc employ a combination of both.  We want a good amount of vegging out, but just enough geeking out to keep us involved.

"The classic example is in suspense movies, when someone, usually a pretty girl, is running away from a monster or a serial killer, when she happens to trip and fall down.  Whereupon, instead of simply getting to her feet and running some more, she sits on the ground whimpering until the threat catches up with her.  ...The satisfaction, and the solace, offered by good SF, is that its characters don't behave that way.  Consider how Ripley [Sigourney Weaver in Alien(s)], responds to the threat posed by the aliens.  In the second film, once she and the Marines she's with have made first contact with the aliens, and had a chance to catch their breath, they very quickly agree that they should simply go back to the orbiting ship and nuke the place.  **It's a brilliant move on the part of the film-makers, precisely because it is the obvious and intelligent thing to do-it's exactly what we in the audience are thinking to ourselves-but because it's a kind of horror movie, and we've been conditioned to expect stupid behavior from characters in horror movies, it's the last thing we're expecting.  When the idea is raised and agreed on, we wake up, sit a little straighter in our chairs [geek out] and say, 'Oh! This is a movie about REAL people - which is to say, people who behave intelligently.'"**

And that incapsulates my problems with this show's last two seasons pretty freaking well.  There are just far too many instances of people behaving non-intelligently.  Even when they're supposedly intelligent people.  **Here are the S3 spoilers stop reading at this point if you don't want them.**

Perhaps the most perfect example of this is Andrea in the chair with Winston(?) turning into a zombie in front of her, and she's trying to grab the pliers with her feet to break the handcuffs holding her there...and in *several* instances she stops actively trying to get those pliers in order to *talk!*  And remember, she's a lawyer, she's supposed to be pretty fucking smart!  It's unintelligent and counter-intuitive and just plain bad.  There are plenty of other examples like that, but this is the one that sticks out most plainly in my mind.  And it's why I have such problems with this show.  They don't have to be rocket scientists.  But when a few million viewers are shouting at the screen "WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING (IMPLAUSIBLY STUPID ACTION X)!" well you're doing something very wrong at that point.  That this show seems to keep invoking that reaction shows they just have lousy fucking writers.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) There's this whole "Seahawks=bandwagon" thing going on because they're more prevalent lately.  Well first, our numbers have blown up tremendously in general over the past two seasons.  Second, Seattle is a pretty "tech-y" city, so it makes sense lots of them would use reddit and whatnot.  Third, as a Chargers fan myself, I know what it's like to be largely ignored by the media/rNFL/etc, so when success comes along, you're more likely to be vocal about it, instead of the usual "oh...okay..." attitude.

2) I got into a long talk with a Seahawks fan just the other day, about why he uses an NFC flair instead of Seahawks. Basically, he found that he couldn't contribute to a thread without people automatically assuming he was a homer/bandwagoner/etc.  Whereas with NFC flair, he could make the exact same comment he made elsewhere, and instead a quality discussion would ensue.  

3) The reason I post this is the top comment-thread of the "Judgement Free Questions Thread" - someone with Seahawks flair posts about why are the Broncos considered hands down the best team in the NFL by far.  At some point someone says "No need to get mad because someone says another team is better than yours." to which he responds "Never said the hawks are the best" which is 100% patently true - at no point did he say that in even the slightest way.  The next (and highly upvoted) response - "Oh please, that's your entire point."  

Hey even I've made jokes about them.  But I'm starting to feel bad about it.  

Maybe their numbers have increased, but that just means the % of jerks have increased, as the % of jerks exist in every team's fanbase.  But as a collective, we're starting to make wild and offensive assumptions about the *entire* fanbase.  Basically as a whole, we're acting how we acted towards Saints fans during Bountygate, where they just couldn't voice an opinion about something without a bunch of troll/downvote shit following.  

In summation - Fuck the Seahawks, fuck the Broncos, fuck the Saints, fuck the Patriots, fuck e'ry team up in here except mine.  But let's not let that shit get out of hand.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A not-so-brief summation on the end of the NE/ATL game, and why coaches should go for it on 4th and short and/or go for the TD before settling for an FG. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-30 06:25:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before I get into it, I want to first say I understand Smith did the "safe" thing because otherwise he gets crucified.  

Now let's go back to the end of the Fourth Quarter.  Atlanta drives to the New England 3 or 4 yard line, trailing by 10 points.  They reach 4th and 1.  Here is where Smith lost the game (by doing the "safe" thing).  He chose to kick a field goal.  

First - I understand Atlanta has had some issues with 4th down conversions over the past few years, but I don't think that's a reason to just concede the down.  

Second - a field goal makes this a "one score" game, but there's a huge difference between a TD and an FG in the final minutes of a game.  

To begin, Atlanta was in an almost optimal position here.  This wasn't, say, 4th and one at the goal line, or at the 12.  This was 4th and 1 from the 3.  If they can get one measly yard (which is statistically probable) they have four more downs to score a TD.  *While at the same time, keeping all of their timeouts.*

Instead they kick the field goal.  Now it's a 100% given they'll be doing an on side kick.  Best case scenario they recover, but those chances are pretty dreadfully low.  So you're basically assuming at that point -

1) You're giving the second best QB in the history of the game the ball back.

2) He only needs to make it about 30 yards to get into FG position, at which point ATL is down by 10 again.  (Whereas if they went for [and made] the TD instead, they would only be down by 6.  This means they need a TD to win, but they needed a TD just to tie before.)

3) Okay there was a botched snap/fumble in this *particular* instance, but that's an incredible fluke.  If it wasn't for that, it would be fairly safe to assume the Pats make their fourth and short conversion.  Now ATL needs to burn all their time outs, and hope to block a field goal in order to have *any* chance.  

4) Let's assume they do precisely that - burn all their timeouts and block the field goal, which barring a fluke fumble, is their only chance at all by this point.  Now they have 0 timeouts, probably somewhere around a mere ~50 seconds left on the clock, and have to drive 60 yards *and score a TD and nothing else will work but that.*

So let's say Coach Scrotey McBallsy was in charge of ATL.  

A) He goes for it on Fourth and 1 at the 3.  He now has 4 downs to get a TD, or fine maybe he doesn't test his luck and kicks an FG the second time blah blah.  But in this situation, they only need a mere *two yards* to score a TD.  Not 70+.  

B) He doesn't get the on side kick either.  But now the only thing that kills his hopes is a NE TD.  If they settle for a FG, fine, he needs a TD, just like Mike Smith would have needed it.  Except in this case, a TD *wins rather than ties.*

C) Let's say they even managed to stop NE sooner, where a FG wasn't viable.  Sure they've probably burned all their time outs at this point, and there's probably also only ~1:10 on the clock.  But now they only need to drive maybe ~40 yards and kick a FG (high % play), instead of 70+ and score a TD (lower % play).  

Atlanta lost because of a lack of balls.  Smith gets to walk away (largely) unscathed because he played it safe and gets to blame his players for lack of execution.  Julio had a crazy good (and crazy low probability) catch that got them close so it makes it seem like Smith made the right calls.  But at the same time, that Julio catch had them in FG position for a tie, if they'd gone for the TD and made it before.  

Note: Most of this is from having read many grantland/"thank you for not coaching"/mmqb/tmq articles.  Too lazy to look them up for sourcing stats atm.  Also I'm a Chargers fan so I've seen my team lose because of "playing it safe" way too fucking often.  

Edit: As someone brought up, thought I'd point it out here - 

If NE scores a Field Goal it's game over regardless.  After an onside kick it's hugely probable (especially NE) will do so, it just didn't happen to turn out that way because BB has balls and went for it on Fourth (and won).  NE only has to go ~30-40 yards to make a FG and win.  In the Scrotey McBalls scenario, NE has to score a TD or they might lose.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All this Freeman talk.  Chargers are my team but every few years I pick a "second favorite" team, someone who I think is on the rise but not there yet.  When the Saints got Brees, they were the team.  Then they won an SB, so I switched to the Bucs, around Freeman's first or second year.  I really wanted to see him do well.  And every post I see about Schiano being a jerk makes me feel Freeman got shafted.  But, seeing his play and attitude during games...I'm starting to think maybe I just wanted to see him do well strictly for the reason that I wanted to see him do well.  

I really haven't watched enough of the Bucs the last two seasons to really have much knowledge of the situation.  I just hoped Freeman would kick ass is all, and I'm a bit sad it didn't work out that way. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll try to be as brief as possible.

I work at one of two cafes owned by the same people.  There's a West and an East location.  I predominantly work the East, while the people I'll soon be talking about work West.

Similarly, two owners; a divorced couple.  The ex-wife predominantly West, the ex-husband predominantly East. 

And finally, two of my coworkers started dating; both predominantly West, the girl occasionally East while the guy is almost never East (and I am 99% East).  

The boyfriend just got fired.  He was assistant manager, for all intents and purposes.  He was fired for a variety of reasons I won't get into, but they were basically valid reasons.

Now, this Sunday, just two days after the boyfriend gets fired, I'm scheduled to work with his girlfriend and the ex-husband co-owner.  

Earlier I tried to bring up to the ex-wife co-owner that maybe it wasn't the best idea to have her working the same time as the co-owner, since maybe his resentment would rub off on her.  I'm still pretty doubtful she'll even show up that day at all.  

The female co-owner gave me a, "Yeah but she is very professional and mature and she could use the support" thing, which I mostly agree with; she is very professional and mature...but she's also privately voiced things to me like she was willing to quit and walk out over various things...which I couldn't bring up to the boss because she voiced them in confidence.

I'm just really worried about this Sunday.  If she even does show up, how maybe even the slightest slight from the male boss might make her walk out because of this whole thing.  

Has anyone gone through something similar?  Should I be expecting the worst?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This [CBS Sports Power Rankings](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/powerrankings) is the latest and probably the worst, but I've seen similarly bad predictions about the Chargers this year.  I mean this one has us 27th, behind the Vikings (really?) the Cardinals and Rams (really?!), the Titans and Bucs...

Part of me thinks ending up with the 5th overall pick next year wouldn't be the worst thing.  

But c'mon, we have an established QB, Mathews and our other RB's were looking great, the O-Line is mostly fixed, and our D is looking more respectable.  Each one of those teams that gets placed before us has a big fat question mark at QB, most have O-Line's just as shaky if not definitely worse, and aside from one or two big names (Revis suddenly makes the Bucs a great defense all by his lonesome?) D's that are in tough, high-scoring divisions.  

Bah.  I guess we'll find out soon.

Go Chargers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you're the sidekick to James Bond.  The villain is in a plane taking off down a really long runway (cause it's a huge plane so it takes a long time to lift off or whatever).  

You're driving a car, trying to catch up with the plane, so Bond can jump out of the car and onto the plane before it takes off.  

So you're just flooring it you know, so you can catch up.  Here's the thing though; at the end of the runway is a giant cliff, because that makes for a more dramatic chase.

Bond Jumps off and lands on the plane!  Now you have to stop the car.  Just to make it more dramatic, rather than simply hit the brakes, you pull a 180 (okay I'm actually stealing this all from the Captain America movie I'm watching right now).

MY QUESTION!  It's here it's finally here - 

What is the best method for stopping the vehicle at this point (summation - driving really fast, pull a 180 and need to stop)?  Would you just hit the brakes?  Or would it actually be better to keep flooring the gas at this point?  (And since this is from Captain America, this is a car built before ABS was around)

Sorry for the long-winded post, and yeah the idea of stopping that way is probably just silly, but it made me wonder. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> While watching preseason games, it seems the QB's are more mic'ed up/louder than in regular season games. And because of this, their cadence when snapping seems very predictable. Does this change through the regular season? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Like watching the Ravens game last night, Flacco was loud as hell, and I can't remember the exact wording he used now, but it was something like, "Ready?!  Ready, hut!" Pretty much every time I paid attention.

Watching GB now, I'm hearing Rodgers say "Green 18?! Green 18, hut!" 

And every time it's pretty much the same pacing on how he says that, just like Flacco last night.

So 1) from what I remember, it seems rare for QB's to be so audible (pun intended) during the regular season.  Are networks restricted from playing this audio during the regular season, but not during the preseason?

2) Are the "ready set hut" calls much more variable during the regular season?  Because the way it looks in these two preseason games, it seems like it would be very easy for a D-Lineman to "guess" the snap most of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regarding PC: I have roommates.  I watch movies at night.  Our walls are paper thin.  So I'm trying to watch the Avengers right now and I'm constantly adjusting volume - 54/67% during action scenes, 100% during talking, back and forth and back and forth the whole time.  Tiring.

Similarly at work - I use Pandora.  I have a custom station with lots of songs from the 40s/50s and lots of modern stuff.  The 40s/50s stuff - super quiet, I have to walk to the back and turn up the receiver by 30% or so.  Then a modern song comes on and I have to go to the back and turn the receiver down 30%.  

I just find it so hard to believe that people were complaining about this sorta stuff in the 80s, and 30 years later we're making graphene and "teleporting" data and landing rovers on Mars yet it's still "impossible" to just have a given movie/set of songs/etc stay a consistent volume.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DC in particular has made a number of truly awesome movies.  They have a deal with Warner Bros' to put out X number of animated movies per year.  But just because that deal is in place, it hasn't effected quality.  


They're really, truly doing "adult" style movies, with the only bias being 
"it's animated so it's for kids".  

If you can overcome that bias, you'll realize what a fantastic collection  of movies awaits.

And as the title states, DC is winning this race in a huge fashion. But Marvel still has a good number of good animated movies. 

Look them both up on wikipedia. Both Universes's have a lot to offer.  Just, atm, DC moreso. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay this is largely a rhetorical question.  One company is pumping money into the venture, the other isn't.

It's just crazy to me how DC pumps out so many freaking good animated movies.  Marvel tried, for awhile it seems, then gave up I guess?

Planet Hulk, Hulk vs Wolverine, Hulk vs Thor, and to a lesser extent the Ultimate Avengers movies..

But they still pale in comparison so so much to Batman Under the Red Hood, Justice League - Flashpoint Paradox (which I'm watching now), Batman Year One, Superman - Doomsday, Superman   Batman - Apocalypse, Superman   Batman - Public enemies, etc etc....

DC is just pumping out amazing animated movies one after the other while Marvel seems to have started then gave up.  

Again, mostly this is rhetorical.  But holy fuck DC is making some awesome animated movies while Marvel isn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll try my best to make a long story short - 

A friend is trying to create a TV show...maybe online only, maybe a pitch at a proper show.

He filmed a kickstarter "ad", he filmed much of a "first episode", he's had several meetings at my house discussing ideas.

I haven't been included in most of this.  But I'm vaguely friends with the guy.  So as an outsider, I can see any number of problems with everything I've seen/heard.  

His kickstarter "ad" was horribly edited and not very interesting to boot.  He filmed much of the first episode without having much of an idea about how the first season (let alone the entire storyline) would pan out.  

I want to tell him these things but as I said, I've been left out of almost this entire process, so I'm not sure how to go about it without just seeming like "oh you're just bitter because you haven't been a part of this project".  

It's not that I want to see him fail. I don't want to see him succeed either.  I'm entirely neutral.  I don't want to discourage him, I just want to say what he could do better, without seeming bitter. And I guess I don't know how to do that.

Edit : note, his first kickstarter campaign was hoping to raise $5k, and raised only $1.2k, $1,000 of which came from a single good friend of his.  I offer that as "proof" that I think the idea isn't very valid/well executed, and has room for improvement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So to begin, I stated this thread wasn't for Peter King haters.  But I'm guessing more than a few will show up anyway because reddit.  So to you folk I offer this - I don't adore Peter King, I don't treat every word he says like sacrament, I don't jizz when he mentions the latest marathon he's running.  But he does get access to a lot of players/coaches/etc that other people don't get access to, and he can offer good insights in that regard.  Two quotes for why I like Peter King - 1) Possibly Confuscious? Probably not - "Even in the foulest of swamps a lily may bloom."  2) An old roommate of mine - "It doesn't matter which news station you watch/read/whatever, right wing or left wing or whatever; what matters is *how* you watch it."  So there, that's why I read MMQB and derive enjoyment from it.

That stuff being out of the way - What are your thoughts on the new layout/"specialness"/etc of the new MMQB?  I'm still not really sold on it - I just wanted to read the "normal" MMQB and not get bogged down with all these changes.  But anotheranother part of me always hates change at first, then typically grows to love it.

	<TEXT> I lived in Australia from 2000-2003.  During that time the Olympics took place there.  For certain of the main attractions, a comedy troupe would perform on radio; they'd do a pretty good job of actually narrating what was happening at the event, but they'd throw in their own funny anecdotes/snarky comments/rude jokes/etc throughout.  It was *much* better than listening to the actual TV broadcasters.  You just turn your radio to the frequency, mute the TV, and voila. 

So I'm thinking some of us could do something similar.  Really, the goal is to provide an alternate-listening-experience during the Super Bowl, but we'd need practice before attempting such a feat, so we'd use occasional regular season games for that.

Things I'm not entirely clear about -

1) How a small group of us could simultaneously transmit through some Internet-medium of some description from various locations.

2) How "live" it would be, or if the inherent Internet-mediumness would cause a delay that would make our announcing too out of synch.

3) Who would be a combination of funny enough, and also willing to give up hanging out with friends to watch the SB, in order to do this.  I hate my friends so I'm totally willing.  

I do have a friend who runs an ISP/website hoster, so I could get free (or really really cheap) hosting for at least some of the functions, depending on the answers to 1 and 2.  

Anyway, just tossing the idea out there.  Maybe it'll work, maybe too many hurdles.  (And yeah I know the NFL bans "descriptions" of the games so we might get shut down quickly, but if we keep our regular-season broadcasts limited to /r/NFL only...maybe it would survive long enough...)

Edit: currently googling for answers to 1 and 2.  Finding interesting results. </TEXT>

3) Use one of those box-window-fans to blow cool air in.  

4) keep lower-level windows closed, keep upper-level windows open, to vent heat.  

None of it seems to make a difference.  Surely someone here knows the optimal method.

	<TEXT> Deleted the original thread, because I became paranoid that I might be breaking the NDA.  Got approval from the mods, so here it is again.

Background - started playing DotA sometime around 2006ish.  Switched to HoN in 2010 or so.  Those are pretty much the only games I've played for the past few years.  But - I have played a handful of games in LoL and Smite as well.

* I like that this combines elements from almost each one of those games.  The shopping system is a lot like Smite, which I find is more intuitive/easier for noobs than HoN/DotA.  I also like the LoL-style feature of having two "extra" skills on top of the 4 unique to the character.

* Last hitting creeps was really, really difficult.  Maybe this is just getting used to attack animations.  I also just jumped right in before adjusting key-bindings (noob!).  But I didn't think it would be *that* hard to last hit.  

* I think the way-points (not sure the official name atm, but Wayne Tower and the Subway and whatever) should have some sort of defense mechanism.  Maybe not as difficult as HoN/DotA towers.  But my teammate and I could just run past the creeps and capture the waypoint with no bother while the enemy was busy elsewhere.  Maybe this is just part of the strategy of the game, I dunno, but it seemed a bit too easy.

* The graphics are freakin slick.  Well done.  Each Moba has a level of learning what spells from heroes look like.  But if you're even halfway familiar with the DC universe, it helps alleviate confusion a great deal.  "Oh, Green Lantern just dropped a jet on my head, that's why I died."  (As opposed to my first dozen games in HoN being like, "...what just happened...?")

* Mouse-over info on the endgame screen would be nice.  I have no idea what "Drones/Controls/Dest." means.  I can wager a guess, but I'm not sure.

* Also I couldn't seem to change my Shop list away from the "Recommended".  I'm sure this is something that will get changed, but while our team was totally kicking ass, I would have liked to explore different items (since I'm sure they would have done fine without me).

* New one here after playing more - the creeps in this game seem...kinda pointless...there just seems to be so much constant moving, spending a few seconds to take a control point then moving for a gank or another control point...it seems that laning in a traditional Moba is something you shouldn't really do in this game.  It just seems like a waste of time sorta.

All in all this looks impressive.  

And now to start my second match. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Discussion] On the Baroque Cycle/Neal Stephenson </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-19 06:15:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm curious as to others' thoughts on this series, and thought I'd post my own.

As a disclaimer of sorts - there are only two novels by Neal Stephenson that I have read less than three times - The Big U (which I just completed for the second time), and The System of the World, the final chapter of the Baroque Cycle, which I am currently working my second way through and which brings me to this post.

I love Stephenson's writing style, whichever form it takes.  From the zany/action-packed/Tarantino-esque "Snow Crash" to the plodding/pent-up/slow-accumulation of "Anathem", and most everything in between.  

But this third book ("System of the World") I am struggling with, for the reasons laid out below - 

1) It seems Stephenson decided he would create three ~1,000 page works and set out to achieve that goal, regardless of the pacing/style/"interestingness" of the work. 

2) I find myself skipping over large sections of this work because of that, which is something I very infrequently do.  I reach a point where I see that the next ~4 pages are simply long paragraphs describing what London/(insert setting) looked like at the time, or similar, and I ignore those parts until I start seeing quotes again, signifying a return to plot.

3) Even those parts with quotations/"plot" involved frequently seem to be large diversions simply to fill page numbers.  

My experience with the series is thus - 

Quicksilver - Read in it's entirety 3-4 times.  The long descriptions (that I find tiresome in "System of the World") contribute to the richness of the world.

The Confusion - Read it's entirety twice.  Read the Shaftoe/Waterhouse sections 2-3 more times, while skipping over most/all of the Eliza parts.  I suppose this is where the series started to lose me.  The Eliza parts are where I first felt that he was simply trying to fill in page numbers.

System of the World - Second time through, and already finding I'm skipping large sections.  By this point I really don't need two pages describing what a particular street looks like.  I've already grown quite accustomed to what ~1700's London is like.  An entire paragraph devoted to how a single alley is laid out seems wasteful, and there are many such paragraphs.  

Anyway, just wondering how others have approached/perceived this series.  Am I right in thinking he basically "wasted time" in overly-describing things to fill pages?  Or did you find it wasn't a big deal and still highly appreciated every word?   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dear Google Play Music : Regarding your "radio" function - you almost perfectly copied Pandora. Which is why I'm keeping Pandora. [x-post r/google] </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The whole Spotify-esque features, I don't care so much for. I only really use these services while working, where I'm too busy to think about a specific album. So I look for good Internet radio.

I thought this new Play Music would be the solution. Pandora has many, many faults. (Note: I do use the paid service, not free.) And, basically, Play Music has the same problems as Pandora, except worse.

My problem with Pandora : basically, the station I put on plays the same playlist every time. I up-thumb a song, thinking maybe it means it will play more/different songs by that artist, but no. It just means it makes sure to play that same song every. single. day. to the point where I eventually down-thumb it, because I'm sick of it. But the thing is, at least it only plays that song once per day.

My problem with Play Music : It plays the same songs more than once per work-day. I heard several songs repeated within a six-hour period. (Yes my work day is eight hours, but I noticed the songs repeating within six hours.)

What's worse? At some point this really annoying song came on. I went to give it the big thumbs down to make sure I never heard it again. And guess what. I had already given it a thumbs down, yet there it was being played. The salt in the wound? About 20 minutes later, a song from the same album was being played which I then had to give a thumbs down to as well. I'd think that giving one song on the album a thumbs down might mean "I don't like these people, stop playing them" but apparently not.

Now, about the Spotify-esque feature of "whatever you want to listen to on demand". I had this one song in mind, Bandits by Buck65. I really, really wanted to hear this song. They have the previous album (2003, "Talkin Honkey Blues"), and later albums, but for whatever reason, they don't have that album (2004, "This Right Here Is"). So not only can they not copy Pandora correctly, they can't copy Spotify correctly either, apparently.

And finally, a feature of Pandora that always keeps me coming back - "Add variety." In a single station I can add Lemon Jelly, Beta Band, Skull Snaps, Nina Simone, Nillson, and have a nice, highly variable listening experience. Still haven't found an Internet radio app that does the same.

**TL;DR - Play Music still seems to be in a very, very beta stage, despite it launching "officially". They have some bugs to work out, and some features to add, before I'll even consider making a switch.** </TEXT>

My problem with Play Music : It plays the same songs more than once per work-day.  I heard several songs repeated within a six-hour period.  (Yes my work day is eight hours, but I noticed the songs repeating within six hours.)  

What's worse?  At some point this really annoying song came on.  I went to give it the big thumbs down to make sure I never heard it again.  And guess what.  I had **already given it a thumbs down**, yet there it was being played.  The salt in the wound?  About 20 minutes later, a song from the same album was being played which I then had to give a thumbs down to as well.  I'd think that giving one song on the album a thumbs down might mean "I don't like these people, stop playing them" but apparently not.

Now, about the Spotify-esque feature of "whatever you want to listen to on demand".  I had this one song in mind, Bandits by Buck65.  I really, really wanted to hear this song.  They have the previous album (2003, "Talkin Honkey Blues"), and later albums, but for whatever reason, they don't have that album (2004, "This Right Here Is").  So not only can they not copy Pandora correctly, they can't copy Spotify correctly either, apparently.

And finally, a feature of Pandora that always keeps me coming back - "Add variety."  In a single station I can add Lemon Jelly, Beta Band, Skull Snaps, Nina Simone, Nillson, and have a nice, highly variable listening experience.  Still haven't found an Internet radio app that does the same.

**TL;DR** - Play Music still seems to be in a very, very beta stage, despite it launching "officially".  They have some bugs to work out, and some features to add, before I'll even consider making a switch.   </TEXT>

So just to clear up a few things.

1) I still frequently respond to messages about the spam filter.  It's hyperactive and posts frequently end up there. (Edit: Stated in the side "rules" but just to state again - if your post hasn't shown up send me a message and I'll approve it.)

2) I don't post here under this account, because I don't want people upvoting me just because I'm the mod.  That being said, I do post here using other accounts.

3) Generally speaking, I think most subreddits are best when left mostly hands-off.

4) If anyone has suggestions for what I should/could do better, I'm all ears/eyes.  

But whomever it was trying to take moderatorship from me...please don't. </TEXT>

My back is...mauled.  Okay maybe not that bad but still.  I've never been with a woman like this.  And the thing is I have a very high sex drive, so I'm hoping/expecting this to turn into a multiple-times per meetup thing.  

But I just don't know if my back can take it.  It didn't really hurt at the time, and was very intriguing and hot at the time.  I'm just thinking, if we spend an entire weekend together, by the end of it my back will look like Kunta Kente's, and I don't know if I can handle that.  

It's obviously a turn on for her, so I don't want to (entirely) discourage it.  Just wondering if there's a way to keep it at a minimum, I suppose? </TEXT>

I wouldn't attack, I would literally take my hand of the keyboard so I didn't staccato again, and I would still always end up with the kill.  Or, often enough that the new girl's boyfriend would bitch me out for KSing.

I know creeps can get last hit and I can still be rewarded with the kill for doing most damage.  But still, it happened often enough it made me wonder about staccato.

	<TEXT> Atheist, so I don't really think the title, but...fuck.

I feel like if I write the whole history of the last two years I'll just get depressed and end up going to suicide watch.  So I'll just say the latest example since that's what has me upset enough to be here.

Start talking to a girl on OK Cupid.  We're hitting it off great.  I ask her out to coffee this past Sunday.  She says yes.

We meet.  We (as far as I could tell) had a great time.  Conversation flows smoothly and easily, we're both laughing frequently.  Tons of common interests.  We depart, "I'll talk to you soon," I say.  "I'd like that," she says.

I call today at 5:30.  She's getting her hair done, can I call back later?  I call at 7:30.  Rings twice, goes to voicemail.  A minute later, a text arrives.

"Hey subject4639.  Sorry about the weirdness earlier, I had a bunch of goop in my hair.

Anyway, I met a guy last week [ed: as in, before she went out with me] and I like him and think I'm going to pursue that.

But if you still wanted to be friends and stuff, I'd like that.  And sorry about texting, I'm just bad at doing this stuff over the phone."

All I'm left with is the feeling that she went out with me because she was hoping to "trade up" and for whatever reason I ended up with a lower score than the other guy.

And this is an example of about a dozen similar events that have happened in the past two years.  Not all relationship-related; two great jobs I was certain I would get only to find out I didn't (one because they "thought I was a great fit, but we feel we need a female presence in the office"), etc...

This is the toughest string of consecutive near-victories-turning-to-defeats I've ever gone through.  Every time the dice roll, they roll in someone else's favor.  I just can't get a break. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yeah, I get it, I'm just using the free mode, so there are ads.  But seriously, why can't they play them at the volume of the music, or hey, even just a tad bit quieter?  

Instead they're following the same BS model that has pissed everyone off about TV since the 80s.  I'm driving around, listening to music, and suddenly my speakers are nearly blown out by an ad for some insurance company or whatever.  

Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.

Edit: Since a bunch of people are making assumptions, a few being quite rude about it, to clarify a bit - I use (and pay) for Pandora at the moment.  But it's radio function has left me feeling pretty "blah."  You add a band to create a station, and then you hear the exact same songs every single f'ing day.  So I was **testing Spotify's radio to see if it was better.**  I don't particularly care for/need the ability to access any song I want at any time.  I just want a good radio app that plays a variety of music instead of (what seems to be the case with Pandora) a single playlist on shuffle.

	<DATE> 2013-04-03 02:30:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To repeat the title with a little more info - 

1) China has more or less been forced to be an ally of North Korea.  During the Korean War, they seemed to happily embrace this stance.  Lately, they seem more and more upset at being placed in awkward situations due to the increasingly erratic behavior of DPRK.  

2) China fears there will be an incident, intentional or accidental, that will cause the US to invade, resulting in a strong US presence right against their Northern border, meaning a second potential front (as Taiwan provides a potential Southern front).

3) China decides to preemptively invade North Korea.  They argue the US didn't need permission from the UN to invade Iraq.  They argue they're trying to free an oppressed people from a diabolical leader in possession of WMD's, just like Iraq.  

What would be the likely outcome/reaction if this were to happen?  Or, in other words, could it feasibly work out for China?  

I imagine it's doubtful the US would declare war over such an act.  I imagine the US would complain a lot, "sovereign rights (even if acting insane)" and so on.  China would also now have a "buffer State" similar to the USSR/Eastern Europe post-WW2.  

Would it make sense for China to do something like this?   </TEXT>

But...when searching, I see the final score of the match.  So there's little point in watching the game because I know the final outcome.  

I figure it wouldn't be that big of an adjustment to make.  

For instance, searching "uefa champions league", you include a nifty schedule of recent and upcoming matches.  The recent matches include the final scores. In place of the scores, just include a little button that says "Show Result" for those games?    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One small change would have made a world of difference in these scenes.  

If she would have kept trying to get the pliers *while* talking to Milton.  

Instead, she stops to talk to him, stops to talk to see if he's dead.  This is just so utterly unbelievable, that someone would risk their life just to talk.  

And that, to me, sums up my frustrations with the show itself, in general.  

If, like in the comic, very minor comic spoiler[](/c "they were doing things like planting gardens,") and talking while doing that, that's one thing.  Instead, they do literally nothing while talking.  Countless other examples of the same.  

My problem with the show isn't that there's non-stop zombie killing hoorah!  Character development is fine.  But you can have characters DO THINGS while talking, like for instance, saving their fucking life when they know someone is about to become a zombie.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, so in AP if you random you don't get extra gold.  As stated in the title, I think this is lame.  

But if you're going to do that, what about this...

In AR, let one person per team allow for an AP pick - but, they end up with repick gold.  

As in - you're playing AR, you random the team of 5 int squishies and you're in desperate need of a tank.  Right now, your only option is repick and *hope* you get a tank/carry/whatever.  

What if you let one person per team choose their pick, in AR only, but they end up with the same amount of gold as if they repicked?  Maybe you're the 5 melee team and want to repick into Bubbles or something...sure, but only 453 gold.   Or as I said earlier, the 5 intel team and you want a tank.  Sure you can repick and choose Devo, but only 453 gold.  

**TL;DR** - Allow a chosen repick in AR mode, as opposed to a random repick, but get stuck with less gold a la normal repick.  

Edit for some clarity - my response to a comment that's been deleted - "I was trying to say (and I've had a bit to drink so sorry for being confusing) - only a single person can choose their repick.  I guess whomever comes first.  If a second person repicks, they random their repick just like it is now, and lose the same amount of gold.  " </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I'll probably do a poor job of summarizing his arguments but I'll try my best.  

1) You have a guaranteed amount of damage, which is fairly high early game.  Later game, the +24 damage might not be comparable to the potential scaling of the str/agi/int boost from steamboots.  But early game, +24 damage, it's way over powered.  

Edit: 1b) How does the scaling of steamboots compare to the +24 damage of ghost marchers?  Let's say Flux at level 8 versus Flux at level 25?  How much damage output is the steamboots/GM difference going to be?

2) The phasing effect.  You can escape/chase way better than any other boots.  

3) TP boots are awesome, but too expensive.  Armor Boots would be cool if they applied to heroes, but they only apply to creeps.  

Because of these bits of info, I find myself buying ghost marchers on practically every single character.  With the occasional exception of blink characters (since they don't need the speed boost for chasing). 

So can you explain why for the characters, let's say....Mage Bane, Predator, Torturer, and Bramble...why would Steam Boots be preferable to Ghost Marchers, or vice versa?  Other character examples? </TEXT>

Yesterday and today I've had queue times of: 12 minutes (cancelled), 15 minutes, 18 minutes, 22 minutes, and I'm currently at 23 minutes.

Those are all three times longer than average, and many are twice as long as my previous longest.  

AR is listed as the second most popular game mode at the moment.  And 80,000 people are on.

But...got a call from my manager, who says I have to open, 6:30AM-2PM tomorrow...because that same girl is sick again.  Funny, how she keeps getting sick on the weekend...

Finally, I'm 32, so I don't know if I still have the stamina to come home from a show at 2 AM and go to work 4 hours later for an 8 hour shift.

	<TITLE> The reason we haven't been visited by "aliens".  And the reason we won't be any time soon.   </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-03-05 05:16:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Aliens will never contact us until we can prove we have evolved past war and become a single, unified, peaceful species. They know about us, there are probably cloaked transmitters the size of a dime floating in space keeping tabs.

Why do they require us to be peaceful? Here's the thought-experiment that led me to this conclusion -

Two planets, Alpha and Beta. Think of them like Earth and Mars, except both have intelligent life at the same stages of evolution, where we're at now. Which means, maybe they get along peacefully most of the time, but they don't trust each other. War will come.

So, Beta has received intel that Alpha is going to attack them. Beta decides to launch a pre-emptive strike. They're going to send 10,000 nuclear warheads at us. They paint them black, create a propulsion system that doesn't leave an obvious trail. Stealth Nukes, that Alpha has no idea about until, whoops, all of Alpha has been nuked to cinders.

Now into this scenario we insert a temporal vortex thingamajig. Time gets rewound 20 years. Except, everyone on both planets has memories of what just occurred.

So Alpha litters their orbits with high-tech sensors which can detect the nukes. Alpha can now safely detect and destroy any of the incoming missiles from Beta. Beta sets up their own similar network, thinking Alpha might try the same trick. But, Alpha, knowing Beta just nuked them, goes with a different strategy. They send a "peace delegation" to Beta. The 5 delegates each carry a component, seemingly innocent on it's own, but when combined create a biological weapon that will entirely destroy Beta's population. They do just that.

Time paradox thingamajig again. Both sides learn from that, develop new defenses. Beta's turn; they send a 100 mile diameter asteroid at Alpha - so large none of Alpha's weapons can destroy it. Alpha is wiped out.
Time paradox thingamajig. Alpha creates a weapon that can cause a mini-black hole. Beta is destroyed. Thingamajig. Beta causes a solar flare that doesn't harm them but destroys the atmosphere of Alpha. Thingamajig. Alpha figures out how to freeze all of Beta's oceans in an instant. Beta is uninhabitable in a week. Thingamajig. On and on in this vein.

The point is - there is **no defense of a planet possible in space warfare.** No matter what kind of defenses you imagine against whatever possible threat you can think of, a determined enemy can figure out something you haven't prepared for, and destroy you that way. Even if your planet is perfectly defensed (impossible, imo, but we'll run with the idea), then fine, they'll destroy your sun.

Warfaring species cannot exist. Maybe they're allowed to explore their own solar system, but I'm certain that if the alien overlords discover an antagonistic species is developing interstellar capability, they'll make their presence known only for the purpose of containing that species from the rest of the galaxy. Destroying most of the population so they return to tribal/basic civilization. Containing the planet in an unbreakable shell, ensuring they lack the resources to leave the planet. Something.

And, if a species shows they are unified and peaceful, and have developed interstellar capability, then and only then are they allowed to join the galactic brotherhood.

**TL;DR - It's too easy to wipe out planets, even with the puny technology we have now. Evolved species monitor potential aliens like us, and if we've proved we've evolved beyond warfare, they allow us to join the galaxy. If we're still violent/antagonistic, they make sure we stay in our own tiny solar system.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For fellow r/NFL'ers who have Game Rewind - each Sunday we are going to watch the best game of the week during the regular season. Continuing with Week 2 this Sunday. Edit for clarity : I'll create a game thread this Sunday about an hour before the "start" of the game.

So post the Week 2 matchup you most want to see here. Whichever receives the most upvotes is the game we will all rewatch together.

**Also, please note** - Include which type of broadcast you prefer.  Some want the All 22, some want the condensed, some want the normal broadcast.  I think normal broadcast is best, so people can watch youtube/torrents, but that's me.

As a reminder, the Week 2 games eligible for voting are - 

Chicago Bears vs. Green Bay Packers  
Oakland Raiders vs. Miami Dolphins  
Cleveland Browns vs. Cincinnati Bengals  
Kansas City Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills  
New Orleans Saints vs. Carolina Panthers  
Baltimore Ravens vs. Philadelphia Eagles  
Houston Texans vs. Jacksonville Jaguars  
Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. New York Giants  
Minnesota Vikings vs. Indianapolis Colts  
Arizona Cardinals vs. New England Patriots  
Dallas Cowboys vs. Seattle Seahawks  
Washington Redskins vs. St. Louis Rams  
New York Jets vs. Pittsburgh Steelers  
Tennessee Titans vs. San Diego Chargers  
Detroit Lions vs. San Francisco 49ers  
Denver Broncos vs. Atlanta Falcons

	<TEXT> A few details - 

I always go to sleep on my side, and most nights she'll sleep up near my head, using my arm as a pillow.  Sometimes she'll sleep behind my legs, in the roughly 110 degree angle formed by my thighs/calves.  These are the nights in question.  Before crawling over my legs to sleep there, she reaches out a paw and gently pats my junk.

It's reached the point where any time I can tell she's going to sleep behind my legs, I use one hand to cover myself.  But once in awhile I'm on the verge of sleep or forget or whatever, and sure enough, *tap!*

No claws are involved.  And the shock of it always makes me immediately react which makes her stop.  So I'm not exactly sure what she would do if I didn't intervene.  Nor am I curious to find out.  

It's happened after days where I fall asleep in the same underwear I've been wearing all day, and days where I've showered and changed before getting into bed, so no, I don't believe it's a smell thing.  (Jerks.)

Oh, and I'm apparently supposed to include a picture of  her, so [here she is using my arm as a pillow](http://i.imgur.com/Wf5aO.jpg) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For fellow r/NFL'ers who have Game Rewind - each Sunday we are going to watch the best game of the week during the regular season.  Starting with Week 1 this Sunday.  Edit for clarity : I'll create a game thread this Sunday about an hour before the "start" of the game.  

So post the Week 1 matchup you most want to see here.  Whichever receives the most upvotes is the game we will all rewatch together. 

As for the watching itself, I'm open to suggestions.  I was thinking maybe a 2PM EST starting time, so more people can participate?  Not too early for West Coasters, not too late that East Coasters miss dinner?  Similarly, as another commenter pointed out, should we watch the "normal" view, or the All-22 view, or the "Condensed" View, etc.  I would say the "Normal" view for the first few weeks as we first understand how this operates. (Hey I'm just as new to this idea as you all are.)

A recap of the Week 1 games for nomination - 

Dallas Cowboys vs. New York Giants  
Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Minnesota Vikings  
Miami Dolphins vs. Houston Texans  
Buffalo Bills vs. New York Jets	  
New England Patriots vs. Tennessee Titans  
Indianapolis Colts vs. Chicago Bears  
Atlanta Falcons vs. Kansas City Chiefs  
Philadelphia Eagles vs. Cleveland Browns  
St. Louis Rams vs. Detroit Lions  
Washington Redskins vs. New Orleans Saints  
San Francisco 49ers vs. Green Bay Packers

	<TITLE> I guess I'm beating a dead horse here - but with HoN 3.0 and the "Learnatorium", it fails in quite a few ways. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-02-10 08:07:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First - why aren't items included in the Learnatorium?  There's no easy way to look up items except in-game. Items are basically as important as the heroes themselves, and some descriptions are somewhat vague.  

Second - why isn't there more detail than the general hero description?  What I mean is, in the picking stage, if you mouseover a hero it gives you a description of each skill.  But many of these descriptions are lacking somewhat key elements.  Some mention the casting speed, most don't.  I understand it's safe to assume that "Lifesteal" means per damage inflicted, but Predator's Lifesteal is based on HP of enemy.  Maybe it seems redundant to some people, but for me (and probably noobs) it would be nice to understand the differences.  Lord Salforis's first spell, for instance - the description says "causes damage after *some* time".  His passive gives you a X% Lifesteal, and it seems like it's obviously damage.  But maybe it would be nice to know that before using the character.  

Third - or perhaps 2B, the skills in the Learnatorium are only described at their max capabilities.  It doesn't show each level.  C'mon.  It's the *Learn*atorium, it should be teaching you everything.  

I guess the basic point is - the Learnatorium should be a valuable resource to all players, new or experienced.  You play Salf enough, you "just know" how long his first skill takes to go off.  but ask one of you in person and the response will be "I dunno, it takes 1, maybe 1 and 1/2 seconds..."   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-01-31 06:44:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was asking in chat whether there was an "official" thread for this and mattman kindly told me that no, typically this subreddit was flooded with various posts/ideas around new rev time.  So I thought maybe we could condense some ideas here?

I've had a few ideas - 

1) Rose City, the current city I'm mayor of.  The original idea was little more than "build lots of bridges, and plant lots of roses." We've come up with some new ideas/refinements. 

2) As noted in the terrain-ideas thread, I had some vague notions of starting a town in a very cliffy area, where all the buildings were carved into the cliffs, balconies, etc.  But I've been doing a test build near Wellspring and...it's not working out so...well.

3) Inspired by a recent /r/minecraft post, now I really really would like to found "Tuscany" - [here is the post that inspired](http://imgur.com/a/H6uk3#0) - white buildings with brick roofs, wood accents.  Or maybe a "Euro Villa" town to make it a little broader, and allow for traditional Greek/French/etc building styles.   </TEXT>

There are just so many games out there I don't know where to begin.  If an RPG, I don't want just any RPG, I want there to be some sort of unique...something...about it.

FPS's don't hold my attention for very long.

Then when I go to that bundle details, I see I can buy the items individually.  Except there's no warning about "limited use" for the individual items.

	<TEXT> On PvE server - 

1) Eggs are broken.  I try throwing an egg to hatch a chicken, the egg just pops back into my inventory.

2) Bows and/or arrows are broken.  I haven't tried this personally, but was just seeing Weazol and Fraakan talking about it.  Arrows decrease in your inventory, but don't actually get shot.

3) Manually-opened doors are broken, if holding certain items.  When an egg or a bow is the active item, the door just closes again.  Also doors that require a button to open have the same issue, the button depresses but the door doesn't open.  Switch to a dirt block (or whatever), and manual/button doors open fine.  

4) Actually, it seems some (but not all) right-click action items are what are causing the problems.  Just tried opening a chest with an egg as my active item, and the chest doesn't open.  Ender pearls and fire charges work fine for opening doors/chests.  Snowballs have this problem.  Fishing rods have this problem.  Flint and steel doesn't. 

Maybe the haxoring to enable PvP messed things up?

The brain is an incredibly complex and intricate mechanism. We could pour billions of dollars per year at it for the next 100 years and still understand only a fraction of what the brain is and how it works. Guns? Guns are fucking easy; to understand, to legislate, to control. Yeah, people can go crazy with knives or bow and arrow or their car, but how about taking away the *easiest* option from them? This isn't the time for division/opinion? Fuck that. With the gun nuts, it's never time. How is this NOT the time? "We should just come together", yeah, the problem with that is, one side refuses to even budge from their corner, with their fingers in the ears yelling "NAH NAH NAH CAN'T HEAR YOU NAH NAH NAH!" It's easier to get a gun than a car, and there is ONE and ONLY ONE purpose to a gun - to kill things. You say you only use your gun to shoot cans and bottles? Yeah, and you take great joy in the fact you caused massive destruction to cans and bottles. You "killed" the cans and bottles, and took pleasure in it. You can say its purported reason is "self defense" or to "defend yourself from the government" or whatever the fuck else you can come up with, but in every instance the reason to own the gun? TO KILL SOMETHING. Wait, that's not even partially correct. It's not the kill someTHING. It's to kill someONE. You wanna hide behind the Second Amendment? Fine. Make it possible to own a gun. But make it extremely fucking difficult to do so. Set up ammo centers where all your ammunition is stored and you have to go check out in order to use. Make it so I can't walk into Big R at 7AM, plop down less money than an X-Box costs, and walk out with the ability to take nine lives. I'm tired of the Left in this country cowing down on this issue when little fucking children are being gunned down. </TEXT>

I was at level 27 and wanted to reach 30 to enchant a pick, but didn't want to travel all the way to The End or any of that.  So I was running around killing all the mobs that spawned at night.  

I found one infected villager, and I lured him into the Walla Walla Inn and fenced him in.  I'd never cured a zombie before, or even knew how it was done.  So by the time I read up on it, created a Brewing Stand (located in the library, opposite the enchantment room) and brewed all the necessary ingredients, the infected zombie was gone. 

I decided I wouldn't sleep until I cured an infected zombie.  

Now to find Wallette, so we can have us a nice lil village. </TEXT>

(Original text) - Regarding the "hotel" areas -

In the Basic rooms - spend the night, rejuvenate, hide from skele's until the sun rises.

The Deluxe rooms - public chests included, store whatever you want there while you're in town.

The Penthouse Suite - When you're in the room there are two chests, one to the left of the door and one to the right. In the left chest I've included basic crafting items and some iron tools. Feel free to use them, and return them in whatever state. (Note: Nicer items will be there soon, but I've been busy making this tower and I'm still fairly new to this server/MC in general.) In the right chest is where you can place your "payment" for staying the night/using the items. Preferred methods of payment : books, quills, leather (these for helping the Church of the Broadcast), any other blocks you deem valuable.
Hope you enjoy!

	<TITLE> [Mostly discussion, semi-suggestion] Chairs.  Everyone wants them.  But why? Just to sit and stare?  I have an idea, and I'm wondering what yours may be.   </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-04 05:16:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So people love building "chairs" in MC, and people often complain that you can't actually sit in the chair.  Well...why would you want to?  You really just want to sit in a chair in your room and do nothing but sit?  

I understand it adds (a bit) to the realism.  But it doesn't really seem all that necessary of a function, since at least personally, I'd rather be off building/mining/etc. rather than just sit.  (Granted, it would be nice to just sit and admire your surroundings from time to time. But building functional chairs for such a brief/minimal enjoyment is asking a lot.)

My idea - mini-games.  

If two chairs are set up opposite one another, and two players sit opposite one another, they can play a mini-game between them.  The games don't have to be anything fancy - connect-four, tic-tac-toe, things of that nature.  

Tic-Tac-Toe - if a crafting table is set up in between the two chairs, use the crafting area as the gameplay area.  The X's are cobblestone, the O's are dirt.  If you lose, the winner is able to take a single item from your non-queued items. (i.e. something in your "backpack" but not something in your 1-9 items.)

Connect-Four - if a double-chest is set up between two chairs, you can play Connect-Four, using the double-chest as your game surface.  Same winner/loser rules as above.  

Edit: I mentioned this in a few comments but thought I'd add it to the OP - I understand there's a specific suggestion subreddit.  Usable chairs have been suggested many times.  The point of this post wasn't to get across my suggestion alone, but see what ideas people had in general.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been playing on the reddit PVE server, and the Walla Walla farm has some sheep in a pen.  I need a lot of wool.  So I breed the two sheep into six, sheer sheer sheer, then reduce back to two sheep.  

The problem I have is, the sheep take a really, really long time to eat grass/regrow their wool.  In my single player worlds, my sheep would typically eat grass/regrow almost instantaneously.

Our sheep pen is under some cliffs/hidden from direct light.  Also, there's no water source nearby.  

I'm wondering if these are factors in how quickly sheep eat grass/regrow.  If there's water and/or direct sun, do they eat faster?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't have to be instantaneous.  Whether it's after each set of games are played, or at the end of every game except Sunday Night, or at the end of Sunday period, or whatever; I'd be happy to see the scores easily listed on my most-often visited NFL site.  

I know the scores are listed in the bottom ticker of games, and halftime highlights.  But, for instance, I was working all day today, and certain games I don't particularly care about (because they don't concern my playoff cares), I remember the victor but not the score.  

And I'm left visiting (*shudder*) NFL.com or something in order to see the scores.  

What brought this up was seeing the story about Sanchez being benched that's currently one of the top links, but the story was written in the middle of the third quarter and was left with "the score is currently 7-3."  I know the Jets won, but can't at all recall the final score.  

Just seems like something not all that difficult to pull off with 13 mods and all.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The problem/non-problem with the "B.S." rule the cost the Lions the game </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This came up watching the Bears' game earlier today.  There was a certain play that seemed obviously B.S. to anyone watching on TV.  Because it was a turnover, it was reviewed.  

After a short review, the refs came back on the field and said the play stood.  However, because of some on-field issue (injury or something), more time was allowed...and about 30 seconds later, the refs came back and said the play was under review...even though they had just said the play stood as called.  

This seems like precisely the sort of situation the "bullshit" rule that screwed over the Lions was intended to prevent.  Throw in the fact that another review in the Chargers/Ravens game took *nine* minutes to reach a conclusion...

I can see now why, at least in theory, this rule was created in the first place.

It just leaves me wondering, why not set a mandated amount of time for a review?  Give every single review a minimum/maximum of a minute and thirty seconds.  Otherwise, has the replay booth been given enough time to review every angle from every camera?  And even if they have, maybe it's just time to make a fucking decision and make a call, and not take nine minutes to do so.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> RE: 49'ers QB controversy

Would Peyton Manning really have "worked" with the 49ers?  His style of game is so different, and between he and Harbaugh the egos are so strong...the "obvious" answer is "oh the 49ers are so great, if they had Manning they'd obviously be even better!" But is that necessarily the case?

RE: Jason Campbell

When I (only a few weeks ago) found out Jason Campbell was the backup for Cutler, I was surprised and thought, "Well if Cutler goes down, things could be much worse than Campbell."  After last night, not so sure.  Hell, even Cutler's numbers were frequently awful and the defense was the main producer; would a different backup really have done much better?

RE: Fig Newton

Newton's numbers and decisions look awful this year.  So did Freeman's last year, whereas his first and third year (so far) look pretty damn good.  I think Newton will bounce back next year, like Freeman this year.  I haven't watched the Panthers much, but it seems their problems lay more in the coaches-area than the players-area.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a Droid X (original).  I love it to death, and really fear the day I'll have to upgrade.  I've never had any problems with it; didn't have to replace it, everything worked as fine as expected.  Sure it was a little slow, but the hardware is a little slow, so whatever.

But lately it seems like every month or so, when I update all my apps, at least one more app becomes almost useless.  I have a feeling it's because my device is now way down the list on the "check compatibility" list.  I'm also wondering if it's due to apps being created/optimized for dual core systems and things of that nature.  

It started with Lithium, my favorite music player.  A few months ago, it picked up the habit of occasionally ceasing to play music.  It's not paused, and it's not really "frozen" because I can still go back to the menu and select another song, but when I do...nothing happens.  I have to kill the task and restart Lithium, and then it will work again.  

The most recent is Mozilla.  The problems have become so bad I switched to SkyFire.  Similar to Lithium, I'd click a link, the page would start loading and then...nothing.  In Firefox's case, it really was frozen; trying to click "back" or a different link, nothing would happen until eventually "Firefox has stopped responding - force close or wait?"

Maybe it is just the hardware starting to show its age, but I feel like it's more-so that I'm being "forced" to upgrade so the software runs correctly.  

Bah, I guess I'm just sad I have to give up this phone.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Speculation and SPOILERS up to current episode] Would the group have been better off if Rick had never found them? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In S1E2 - Rick starts off getting the group into trouble simply by being found by the group.  They were originally there for a quick grab-and-run of supplies, and they allude to things going perfectly until Rick shows up.  Who's to say things wouldn't have gone swimmingly, until Rick arrived on the scene?

Now, from this point on, things would be *entirely* different, so it's incredibly speculative, but continuing on...

Merle, the first "victim" of Rick.  Now, Merle has some problems, he's a bit of an asshole, but as we've seen recently he can be kinda allright, and there's a good chance Daryl (who seems pretty dang honorable) would have been able to keep him in check.

When the camp is attacked, there are two points - one, I thought it was somewhat hinted at that, because of Merle being left behind, he may have been responsible for leading a group of walkers to the camp.  Second, as Shane suggests, if Rick and all had been at the camp instead of trying to free Merle, there may have been fewer/no casualties.  

Then he talks them into returning to Atlanta, to the CDC.  This results directly in another member of the group dying, a hugely devastating blow to morale in general, and fleeing without a purpose or base camp.

Shane would most likely have stayed sane without the pressure of Lori/his possible child/so on...

The search for Sofia - another fruitless endeavor, another blow to morale, and in many ways responsible for the deaths/scattering that ended Season 2.

I could go on, but I guess to drop the hypotheticals that followed and return to the beginning - would the group have been better off staying at their camp at the quarry, with Rick never having found them? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hey r/music.  This is an idea I had a decade ago that I still think has potential, though there are also some big flaws.  What are your thoughts on creating, essentially, a band stock market? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-11-10 05:03:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was in two groups in 2001-2003, and as is often the case with garage bands, we wanted to release albums but most of us were struggling just to get by, let alone throw in money to make an album.

We did eventually manage to produce and release two albums.  But I digress.

The point is, during this time I had the crazy idea of, "Why isn't there a stock market system for bands?"  Now that things like Kickstarter are around, it seems more viable, though there are still some obvious problems.  

Basically, the band states it's goal - we want to produce 1,000 copies of a CD, which would cost $3,000 dollars.  If you chip in $100, or 3% of the cost, you'll receive a free copy of the CD, and...well that's where things get confusing and I'm hoping some of you have ideas to make it more viable.

With a 3% investment, maybe they get a 0.3% return on profits?  i.e. the person paid $100 for a 3% investment; if all 1,000 copies are sold at $16 per CD, that's $16,000 gross profit, so the investor receives $480.  

And there's the problem that maybe you invest, but the band experiences "creative differences" and breaks up.  But then again, in the actual stock market, people make bad investments all the time, so...is that such a big deal?  

Anyway, I just thought it was time to throw the idea out there and see what comes of it.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Are you a fan of the author Neal Stephenson?  Myself and another redditor believe many of his novels are contained within the same universe.   </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-11-09 04:23:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The specific novels involved are Cryptonomicon, the Baroque Cycle series, Snow Crash, Zodiac, Diamond Age, and possibly Reamde and Anathem.  

These novels take place in (respectively); ~1940-1945 and 1999ish, ~1680-1750ish, 2020ish, 1998ish, somewhere between 2050-2080ish, and current day and 2100ish.  Many of the novels don't state explicit dates, so I apologize for the vagueness.  

Myself and xrelaht [his comments that inspired this thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12u65p/its_not_often_i_read_a_1000_page_book_for_the/c6ymbmv?context=3) believe all of these novels exist in the same universe for the following reasons (that link leads to the reasons, but to explain them here) -

1) First, nothing in any novel inherently counters another novel's "universe" from existing.  For a random instance, there isn't a mention of, say, London being nuked, while another novel has London still existing.  There are no preclusions.  

2a) There are specific examples, primarily identified by xrehalt - in the Diamond Age, a very elderly woman mentions she was a "thrasher" when she was younger; Y.T. in Snow Crash is known as a thrasher.  Perhaps the two characters are the same?

2b) In Reamde, a character refers to an inflatable boat as a "zodiac", which isn't a common term for such a thing; however, in his novel Zodiac, inflatable boats are frequently used.

3a) More vaguely related; China.  In Cryptonomicon, the threat of China is somewhat vague but certain - China is a "scary" enemy.  In Snow Crash (a few decades later), China is somewhat more serious of a threat. In the Diamond Age, China is basically THE big player, aside from the US/UK alliance.

3b) Cryptonomicon involves the creation of a legitimate digital currency.  Such a thing could easily lead to the economic problems (hyper-inflation) in Snow Crash. 

3c) Similarly, Snow Crash involves a pretty liberal/"free" society; the Diamond Age features a Neo-Victorian society.  Often times, one generation/society is created from the reaction to the previous generation/society.  Thus, the Neo-Victorian attitudes in Diamond Age are more easily understood, as they're a backlash to the ultra-freedom in Snow Crash.

The only novels to take place in a remotely similar period of time are Zodiac and Reamde, and parts of Cryptonomicon - and again, none of these make reference to something that obviously precludes them from sharing the same universe.  Considering all the novels, they span a roughly ~600 year period, but still none of them entirely cancel another's from existing in the same "earth".   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I simply can't get over how damn good this book is.  Like most great things, it's very difficult to describe.  It's fiction, except, it's also non-fiction.  It's kinda sci-fi, except the sci-fi parts are set in (at the time of publication) "modern" day.  It's funny as all hell, while also being incredibly informative.  

There are three main story-lines, with a few others that spring up later - one set in World War 2, following a math genius and Nazi code-breaking; another set in World War 2, the jarhead Marine whose duty is to make SNAFU's look normal (while kicking ass along the way); and the final a modern day character attempting to...well...I don't want to spoil things.  

Being the seventh time through, I'd expect the jokes to be stale and the story so well-known as to be boring, but that just isn't the case.  I'm still laughing hard every few pages, and intensely following each chapter even though I know what's to come.

	<DATE> 2012-11-07 01:47:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Suggestions, and I'm totally open to changing things around - 

Start the episode around 9PM EST.  If you [Google "what time is it"](https://www.google.com/#hl=en output=search sclient=psy-ab q=what+time+is+it oq=what+time+is+it gs_l=hp.3..0l4.1055.2563.0.3070.15.8.0.6.6.1.222.858.4j3j1.8.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.YY0fKLs1xo0 pbx=1 bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf. fp=946618dc30a8941 bpcl=37643589 biw=1366 bih=638) we have a clock we're all in synch with, so we're all starting the episode at almost the exact same time.  

I suggest 9PM EST so West Coast folk can participate.  A lot of episode discussion threads (for any show) start with the East Coast viewing time, meaning West Coasters can't join in.  If enough Westies would prefer a 7PM start, pushing it back to 10PM EST, and the Easties don't mind...

**NOTE** Since this is a *re-watch* thread, it means you can pretty much guarantee there will be spoilers.  If you haven't watched the series before, it is recommended you *not* participate.

Um...well I guess that's it really.

	<TEXT> Mine - when someone like, say, Superman, decides to use a fallen telephone pole, or piece of concrete, or something like that, as a club to hit a villain.  The telephone pole (or whatever) is only so strong and will only transfer a small portion of the total potential energy.  

Just.  Freaking.  Punch him.  

A punch from Superman (or whomever), in my opinion, would do such an exponentially larger amount of damage than hitting with a man-made object.

Anyway, watching Superman vs the Elite right now and had to get that off my chest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hoping to crack 1600 tonight.  

As a bit of back story, I stopped playing hon for 2-3 months, started up again.  Lots of new heroes and a few new items.  My account was 1520ish when I started again, dropped to 1490 while re-learning everything.  Not the highest I've ever been, but feeling good.

My few ideas -

1) How about throwing in extra silver coins for unpopular game modes?  AR is usually at least a 5 min queue, very often a 12 min queue.  I don't mind all that much, I just browse reddit while waiting.  But how about throwing a little extra incentive for unpopular modes?

2) In SD, why can't I see character info when mousing over other players possible selections?  If they shadow pick/pick a char, then I can mouse over and get info.  When I occasionally choose SD to play (for a shorter queue), I'm sometimes left asking, "I'll swap for...that one guy on the far right...Ravenor?  Or is it Prophet...?"  Semi-discouraging for noobs/casual players.

3) Okay this one is probably trickier to implement - but in AP, if someone afks/dc's and gets a random hero, how about making their "random" pick be the character they play the most often?  That way the rest of the team can at least kinda plan their picks and make a good team around the "random" pick.  Right now, it's kinda punishing the whole team because one person wasn't around for whatever reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the end of last season I wrote to Nick Canepa.  I moved away from SD a few years ago, but I still read the Union Tribune articles online.  I was either using a different email account at the time, or I just deleted the emails from disgust.  But my initial email went something like this - 

"During the past few horribly disappointing seasons, I've seen you blame almost every player on the team.  You blame Rivers for throwing INT's, you blame Matthews for fumbling or LT for being too old, you blame the WR's for not showing up, you blame the D-Line for not getting enough pressure, you blame the Safeties and CB's for being almost invisible.  Not once have I seen you blame Norv.  Guess what?  When the entire team is to blame, it's no longer the fault of the players, it's the fault of the coach.  The only thing I can figure is you already have a house in LA and you're trying to help the team move there so you can get a new job at the LA Tribune."

His response was 2-3 sentences, I can't remember exactly what, except for the one sentence - "Look, it's not my job to get a guy fired."

I replied again (receiving no response this time) - "It's not your job to get someone fired.  It IS very much your job to hold someone accountable.  Look at how the media in NY treats Coughlin.  You don't think the pressure placed on him makes him coach harder, hold his players more accountable?"

And of course, Canepa is far from the only one to blame.

This all comes up because of the boltsfromtheblue.com post about firing Norv.  One of the sentences is, "I never thought I'd say this, but the Chargers need to fire Norv."  

Really?  You *never* thought you'd say that?  Even after the past two horrible stenches of seasons?  

The SD media, to me, is plenty culpable in this whole fiasco.  They've continued to act as the unofficial mouth-piece of AJ Smith and flat out refuse to do their job - speak the truth, point out the flaws, hold people accountable.  

If the SD media had half the backbone of the NY media (or Pitt, or Balt, or NE, or many others), Norv would have been fired two or three years ago and we might have a decent coach by now.  

Instead, Norv will be fired (probably not) in mid-season, we'll have an interim coach who will struggle through the middle of next season, and by the time we have a good coach with a strong mindset, Rivers will be too old and/or to worn out, and it will be complete rebuilding mode.  

From here, it looks like 5-6 years (at least) before the Chargers will be considered a dangerous post-season contender again.  In part thanks to the media being soft and not speaking up for change years ago. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Was curious about kickoff return stats, what with the newish rules.  Only 2 teams avg less per return than 20 yards.  Without looking it up, can you guess which team has the best and which the worst average yards per return?  (Hint: They're both AFC.) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It seemed like kickoffs were going fairly deep into the endzone very frequently, and I thought it was crazy that players weren't doing touchbacks every time.  

Welp, apparently 30 teams average more yards than a touchback.  

So, think you know who is the best/worst at kickoff returns? (Only kickoff returns, not including punt returns.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was rewatching some games from the past two nights, and two in particular (both involving the Texans) made me wonder.

In the GBvHOU game, why was Rodgers still playing so late and with such a lead?  

In the HOUvBAL game, same question with Schaub. 

Now, I understand very well that leads can disappear, having watched the SDvDEN game.  And I only just realized this maybe sounds like some sort of advocacy for Tebow, which it very much isn't.

I just wonder, say a team is up 21 to 7 in the second quarter, why not throw in the backup for a few snaps, even if it's just one snap per drive to confuse the defense.  Yeah, that one snap might lead to one pick six and it's 21-14.  But with injuries so common, why not give the #2 a few more reps with the #1 offense?  

I understand the potential downside (pick six or strip sack or similar) is probably greater than the potential upside (backups aren't used that often), but I'm not certain that's really all that true.  Occasionally there's a Cassell who wins 11 games (but still misses the playoffs), but more often it's not, and fans/media/teams just say "well it was our backup QB so of course we were likely to lose." </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay okay, hear me out.

The NFL as an organization makes roughly $6 billion per year. Put half that aside for the next eight years, and that means $24 billion able to be spent on a Lunar Pro Bowl by 2020.
Virgin Galactic currently offers ticket prices of $200k for a trip into the upper atmosphere.

Now, let's say there's a push, and Virgin Galactic decides to make a shuttle that can reach the moon and return. Let's say it even quintuples the price of the ticket for an even $1 million. That's enough for 24,000 people to visit the moon, definitely enough money to visit the moon. Even with prices increased to $5million per ticket, that could get around 4,000 people to the Moon, more than enough for the teams and all the production staff.

Advertising? What better venue? 111 million people watched the last Super Bowl. The first game held in space?! You must be looking at close to 3 billion viewers, at least.

Tie-ins? If just McDonalds builds a restaurant on the Moon to feed the players, that's some major advertising revenue. You thought Super Bowl advertising revenue was crazy? How about the first game on the motherfucking moon?  If the NFL were serious about this, don't you think the government/NASA might want to chip in, to show what a badass nation we are?  NBC chips in a few hundred million per year for TV rights, that helps build the dome they play in.  (Along with NASA and all the other advertisers).  Nike chips in a few hundred million per year to design the uniforms/suits.  

2020, enough time for Virgin to develop a moon-capable vehicle, and all the advertising money that would generate. The NFL only needs to set aside half their yearly profits. Then throw in the money from every other company wanting to get in on the premier deal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was Weeden last week (or two weeks ago?), and the punter this week.  

With Weeden, a lineman batted his first attempt in the air, he caught the ball, and threw it a second time.  Illegal play.  

The punter had his punt blocked, he picked the ball up, and tried to pass.  Illegal.

I don't understand why.  To me, these kinds of plays demonstrate almost everything the NFL is supposed to be about.  Well, Weeden's more so, the punter to a lesser degree.  

It showed great awareness, athleticism, composure, resiliency, and a determination to make a play.  So why is it illegal?  

And I understand that if a QB throws to a WR, the WR can't then make a second forward pass.  It just seems like in the case of blocked passes, a second attempt should be fair play. </TEXT>
