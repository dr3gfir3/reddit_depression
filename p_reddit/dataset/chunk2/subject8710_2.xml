	<TEXT> Having heard about Napoleon for years   years, I never questioned what made him the general he was. However, after looking into modern day revered generals (such as those from World War II) I'm curious about Napoleon. 

Now it's claimed Napoleon ruled over 70 million people in the 19th century which is quite a lot for the period and the [First French Empire] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/First_French_Empire_1812.svg/450px-First_French_Empire_1812.svg.png) covered much of western and central Europe. 

I'm familiar with Nazi Germany and the infamous "Blitzkrieg" tactic  among other German tactics such as the "Schlieffen Plan" but what made Napoleon the infamous general he is?

	<TITLE> Russia vs. The Golden Horde </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From 1283 to 1480, almost 200 years, the Grand Duchy of Moscow was a vassal state to the Mongols (Golden Horde). Considering that's longer than the amount of time Canada has been a nation, the Golden Horde dominated Russia. 

I'm interested in how the Mongols influenced, shaped, and changed Russian history. First, how were Mongols literally the only persons able to invade Russia successfully? Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, must have been a great general in his own right. What was the state of Russia in the 13th century compared to the rest of Europe and the Middle East? 

Fast-forwarding to the 15th century, how was Ivan the III (Ivan the Great) able to secure power, defeat the Golden Horde, end Mongol domination of Russia and assume the title Tsar? 

Furthermore, what role did the Byzantine Empire play exactly since Russia adopted Eastern Orthodox Christianity over other religions? 

According to this Harvard research: https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1997-811-25-Poe.pdf

Russians saw Moscow as the "Third Rome" and this idea was bought forth via Filofei in the 1500's.

Upon Ivan the III's death in 1505, how would the Tsardom of Russia (1533) impact Europe   Asia? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> After 300+ years, why did the Mughal Empire collapse? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Mughal1700.png

Mughal Empire ruled over the Indian subcontinent for 300 years and had claim to a lot of impressive stats, such as: ruling almost 25% of the world's population at that point in time, ruling over 3.2 million square kilometres of land, and sources claim had a GDP of $90 billion in the 16th century.

According to Colombia university: http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_17.html

Lahore is cited as being equal to London in trade, commerce, wealth, etc. in the 16th century. It's stated in the research that the Mughal Empire was very, very wealthy thanks to "indigo, saltpeter, spices, opium, sugar, woolen and silk cloth of various kinds, yarn, asafoetida, salt, beads, borax, turmeric, lac, sealing wax, and drugs of various kinds."

More quotes from the research:

"Apart from silk and cotton textiles, other industries were shawl and carpet weaving, woolen goods, pottery, leather goods, and articles made of wood."

"The manufacture of cotton goods had assumed such extensive proportions that in addition to satisfying her own needs, India sent cloth to almost half the world: the east coast of Africa, Arabia, Egypt, Southeast Asia, as well as Europe." </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's no secret that Germany lost World War I and World War II. Now I'm aware World War I started in 1914 but if we go by the end date of 1918 then it has been less than 100 years.

Germany is still relatively young only created in 1871. Since 1871 they've been a global economic powerhouse and after suffering unfair treaties, destruction, death, displacement, and overall detriment to their economy in the last 100 years, today, Germany still somehow stands as one of the world's top 3 economies. As an Economics major, this is fascinating to me. 

On a related note, the USSR was on the "winning" side of World War II and therefore had treaties which benefited them. Yet somehow the USSR still collapsed economically while Germany kept growing exponentially. An analysis of Germany vs. USSR economies post-World War II and throughout the 19th century in general would be appreciated. Personally, 


Here's an interesting graph I found: http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/photo/active/72.jpg

Per capita, the USSR's GDP was impressive. Moreso than modern Russia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rome is referred to as the 'Eternal City' and was capital of the world for almost a millennia. Rome was the centre of trade, politics, culture, engineering, science, and everything in between.

Milan was conquered by Rome in 222 BC - much later after Rome was already well established as a premier city.  

Milan then saw numerous rulers after the fall of the Western Roman Empire with the House of Visconti, Sforza, Habsburgs, etc.

Today, the city of the Milan and the Lombardy region accounts for 1/6 of Italy's population (10 million) yet accounts for 1/5 of Italy's GDP. Milan is Europe's 3rd biggest economy after London and Paris producing 133 billion per year.

	<TEXT> Throughout history, which of these two cities would you argue has been more "important"? 

Both cities share so many similarities. Rome was founded in 750 BC and Istanbul was founded in 660 BC. Rome grew as a centre for trade due to its central location in the Mediterranean and Istanbul grew as a centre for trade due to its central location between Europe and Asia. Both cities were capital of the Roman Empire and later Rome would be the capital of the Western Roman Empire while Istanbul would be capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. Of course, I am aware Istanbul was called Constantinople for much of history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The United States is 240 years old and in comparison to some nation states, that is quite a long time. The Holy Roman Empire endured as an empire for over 840 years, 844 years to be exact (962-1806), which is unfathomable and ruled over such a large portion of the European continent. 

The House of Habsburg was arguably the most powerful family in Europe as well with Maria Theresa's sons, Leopold II and Joseph II both ruling the Holy Roman Empire in the 18th century and early 19th century and their father Francis I before that. It seems from a political point of view, one of the strongest states ever created.

	<TEXT> http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/World_Electronic_Sports_Games_2016


It was announced by Alibaba Group the other day the $400k prize pool for WESG 2016. 

As someone that has been following since 2010, this is a huge sign of intent. Alibaba is supporting Starcraft II like no other else other than Blizzard themselves have. This should do great things for the scene especially amongst those pro players that have retired of have considered retiring. I think if we see prize pools this size of course more players will flock back to Starcraft II. With Brood War HD coming out amongst other factors, this is what Starcraft II needs. What does r/starcraft think? </TEXT>

Grrrr..., a Protoss from Canada, remains the only foreigner to ever win an OSL (2000) beating Korean legends like HOTForever. He also came 3rd in the 2001 OSL. 

As a Canadian, Grrrr... is an inspiration.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Review: Refurbished Nintendo 2DS (from store.nintendo.com) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-22 23:10:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Recently purchased this: https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/browse/productDetailColorSizePicker.jsp?productId=prod760271


With all refurbished products, I was expecting something in not-so-great quality however, Nintendo really impressed me. 

The 2DS I purchased came in a box complete with the manuals, SD card, AR cards, charger, stylus, and Mario Kart 7 download. The 2DS console itself is literally in 10/10 condition. Thank you, Nintendo. I strongly urge you guys to purchase from the Nintendo store because their products are quality. I can't even tell that this has been used before. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Of these two pseudo-legendaries from the last two gens, who do you favor more? 

I noticed Game Freak have started to focus more on special-based pseudo-legendaries as Hydreigon has 125 Sp. Attack and Goodra has 150 Sp. Defense. This is compared to Dragonite, Tyranitar, Salamence, Garchomp, etc. who are more physical-based.

According to Smogon, both Goodra and Hydreigon are utilized in the OU tier. To those that do Wi-Fi battling, which one do you encounter more?  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-03-08 19:24:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been into competitive battling since the 4th gen (Diamond/Pearl) mostly due to the DS actually being Wi-Fi compatible. I used to do my fair share of Wi-Fi battling and follow Smogon religiously. I know there exists a ton of sweeper Pokemon that anyone could argue could be #1. 

Personally, I'd go with Salamence. I remember when Salamence was deemed too powerful for OU and was re-classed as Uber. I've seen so many Wi-Fi battles where Salamence sets up a few Dragon Dance and proceeds to sweep the entire team. Salamence may be outclassed by Rayquaza but it has the checkmate ability in Intimidate. 

Just as a little side note, I've always loved that Salamence learns Fly by level up unlike Dragonite, Hydreigon, etc. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Favorite rivalries of all-time in Starcraft 2? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've followed Starcraft II for quite a while, since Wings of Liberty era, however, my favorite rivalry is probably from 2014.

2014 was the era of Zest vs. soO in GSL - one of the best rivalries ever. I'm a Terran player however this was a Protoss vs. Zerg that I'd rank over everything. Zest and soO are arguably two of the most talented players to ever come out of Korea. Both of them can regularly hit 500 APM which is impressive as fuck. They met each other in 2014 GSL Season 1 finals, 2014 GSL Season 3 semi-finals, and 2014 GSL Global Championship. Regardless of your race, you need to check out this rivalry in GSL.
