	<TEXT> Your opinion of a joke is not law. Just because you can't find it funny, doesn't mean others aren't allowed to. People are allowed to laugh as much as you have the right not to. Put 100 people in a room and you get 100 different senses of humor. There's no jury that gets to cherry-pick and decide what jokes are okay and what aren't acceptable because a consensus would be impossible (and it's also a stupid idea). So it's either all the jokes, or none at all. You could acknowledge people can be different from you and go on with your life like everyone else, but you'd rather pat yourself on the back for your perceived moral superiority and label anyone who doesn't see things the way you do as "hateful." It really just comes off as desperate attention-seeking if anything. You're in a subreddit called /r/jokes but are being a humorless cunt. 

Also it's a fucking joke.
