	<TEXT> If you have 56.1m go ahead! thatll be ~5m exp before boosts, and ~6m with vos, thats halfway to 99 with just 56m, then id assume a massive payout of about 400-500k exp. thats just rough estimates though, you can get to about 36% extra exp i believe which would just make it insane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Problem with runescape is there is no deleting your account, I think I'm going to try and block it from my computer some how
 As far as a gym buddy goes; I had one, he was the reason I bulked up two years ago, he helped me lift and told me the right techniques, but we transferred gym and we were going to go together, and we did two or three times, then he couldn't and j went, but since then we can't go together because of time restrictions.
I'm going to take in your advice and find another, or maybe see if we can again

thank you very much </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need motivation </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone;
 So I've had a gym membership for two months now, and have only been four times, in the first week.
 I had lost the motivation to go to the gym, and really need to get it back
 In the summer two years ago I bulked up a bit, gained about 10 kg in muscle, and maintained that up until recently.
 I usually have a high metabolism and recently I've notice that declining.
 I'm 17 years old and currently doing my A Levels in PE, ICT, and Maths, so I'm quite knowledgable on how to train
 I just can't seem to be motivated to go to the gym, and it's on my way down from school everyday.
 Another thing is work, I haven't had any work for 6 weeks because of McDonald's are toxic as hell, even though I seemed to be more active then, going to the gym at around that point. I have my first shift again on Sunday.
 I need to be able to show that I can do a 100m sprint, and have an 8 week report ( which I'll probably only do 4 and double it ) so I know what to train, it's just motivation
 As well as this, I have become addicted to playing runescape again and can't seem to put it down
Can I please have your hints on motivation, because right now I feel like shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So for those who have done the quest, you'll know you'll have to kill Arrav. At this point Arrav came invulnerable to me, and I lured him to the Rock and he was still invulnerable. Is this a glitch? Or do I have to wait it out? I teleported out and I'm going back tomorrow (only computer is occupied(#expwaste))
 Also, this doesn't bother me now since it's over, but after I kill two ice demons, the rest were invulnerable to me but not to sir tiffy and whoever else, so I waited it out? Is this supposed to happen?
Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So as I'm aware attuned weaponry requires 90 smithing to make, which is where my problem lies. I'm only 73 smithing, and I'm not sure whether it can be assisted by other players. I know doing it requires 2,000 harmonic dust, it's just the level, and I have the seed. (First task at Elves I get one :D) 
 Also what's the best weapon to make, I was thinking a staff because I can't afford a chaotic, and I have a royal crossbow
Thanks for your help :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Farming advice! </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone!
 So I have done nearly all the quests I need to start while guthix sleeps, only a few short ones, but the requirement is 65 farming, and as I'm Aware it can be boosted, according to the wikia anyway.
 So currently I'm at 54 farming and I need ~200k farming exp.
 I look at the guides on YouTube and don't understand them, so what I'm asking is, how do you guys level up farming at around my level, and what are your techniques; farm runs, times to do a run, and the fastest possible exp. Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm no pro myself but the way I get by, I trained slayer, picking up every drop with a value of at least 1k. Drops like this are extremely common in slayer. With this your level will increase and you'll be able to kill things that are greater xp AND gp an hour. With your already amassed amount of cash I'd highly recommend making investments into t70 gwd armour, so combat is a lot easier. If you get to 81 slayer, you'll have access to Rorarri, which you'll earn anywhere between 300k-5m doing.
 From 1-81 slayer you'll have amassed well over 20m and can afford higher tier weaponry. Now you can skill and get money, 85 mining for rune ore, 10k per ore
There are plenty of methods but I recommend doing slayer, it'll be your best bet.
 If you want to know other money making methods, try looking at the runescape wikia
Sorry for long post
TL;Dr; slayer and wikia and skill </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's mainly lore and rewards orientated.
In some quests, not going to name them, dungeoneering is required and you explore a dungeon during it, but it's still minor
If you're looking at it at a what's the point in it, then just fun, I mean what's the point in smithing or fletching, they basically have a few quests and allow you to make stuff. I know those two are more rewarding in some aspects however
But if you do look at dungeoneering from a rewards point of view, it's one of the most useful skills in the game, with resource dungeons and high level weaponry for f2p and p2p.
If you're asking why you should train it, it's fun, don't set yourself a goal though, it'll only become a grind </TEXT>
