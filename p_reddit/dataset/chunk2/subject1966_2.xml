	<TEXT> One drop, two drips, three drips, four; James's blood is puddling on the floor. How did he get here? What did he do? He's smiling, crying, and his guts are dying too. His good friend Al waits outside the door, holding it locked, holding it closed, while his wife screams some more.

Al has been around since the day James was born, his Father's best friend and his Father's Father's before. His mom would cheat on John with Al on the weekends, in the mornings when the maids did all the cleaning. When the cookery needed doing she'd screw Al's brains, then throw a bit of Shepperd's Pie off to James's plate. James never liked Al- not before twelve- but Al was always there when all the rest were out.

Al smelled bad, smelled like rot and pain and hate, but Al made mommy happy, and Al made daddy sleepy, and Al stared at James longingly, lustfully, knowingly. James didn't like that. When James turned ten Al snuck into his room, placed a hand on his thigh, and smiled smugly, smiled thinly, and James smiled too. James didn't like it but he couldn't quite see; mommy had dumped a bit of gin into his sweet tea, because he was whining, because he was crying, because her head ached so bad; little did mommy know her head would ache off her shoulders, bursting, bleeding, and all her innards failing.

Al never aged, he was always twenty five, like he sapped the youth from his lovers, from his victims, like he held them down under the covers. When Jane wouldn't drink from Al's long straw, Al didn't like that, no, not at all. But James loved Jane, so Jane moved in; Jane took Al's spot on James's bed, and Al slept behind him, not with him, not lovingly, but ruefully. For a while James was free, but four made far too much company, as Billy was born and Billy roamed freely. Al didn't like Billy; he wasn't susceptible like Jimmy.

"Your fault," Al cried, but he cried it through James; he hit, he scratched, he beat and he came. Jane cried and she cried but her love never died, not for Billy nor for James, for it was Al she would hate, Al she never wanted to so much as date. Al ruined their wedding, threw James to the ground, beat him, beat him, made him throw the cake on Jane's gown. Jane hated him so, but Al didn't care; James thought it was him, and those offenses he bared.

And now James sits with slits in his wrists, at the end of his rope, and he can't even taste the bliss, the bliss of relief, the bliss of the end; James can't seem to taste anything but the burning touch of whiskey at his lips. One last time, Al, James screams loudly, but the cuts go up, not sideways; James is gone, and Al is still there, digging his fingers into Billy, four, old enough to know, old enough to internalize, old enough to fear.

Jane screamed as the men dressed in whites and blues arrived.

Billy cried too, but he didn't yet know why. Al disappeared, but only for a time; but that boy Billy could still see his eyes. "You're next, nephew," Al whispered politely, before disappearing into the closet, where he'd sleep snugly and tightly. Ten years would pass before Al would come out, with Billy in tow, the Billy Billy didn't yet know. And that Billy, the one he'd been raised to resist, drove him to the edge, and so the murders persist.

Throw a drink into anything and watch it dissolve; throw a drink to something good and before long you should see just how horrible, how bitter, your life can truly be. Drunk is not a way of life, but a state of mind to experience once, or twice, but not consistently. A shame it was, your life you wasted, until the end, prematurely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing keeps me distracted for long. I'm too much for everyone and im not good enough for anyone. I want to run away from my life or just not wake up anymore. I feel like all i do is stress everyonr out and no one is willing to pull me back or hold me through the storm. Everyone just gives up on me in favor of people who are already happy. I'm never going to make it. I'm never going to be good enough  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> because one day you won't do school work any more. you'll do real work. good work. you'll do something somewhere some way some how that dramatically improves someones life somewhere. you'll find love. you'll have a pet. you'll ahve the clothes you want. not everything will be perfect, but most things will be good. even now, most things are good. you just have to look for the good things. the bad things will go away on their own, but if you don't value the good things, they'll go away too. so pay more attention to the good things, and eventually, you'll have an abundance of them. i hope this helped. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's okay. you didn't let her down. for a good moment, you gave her something amazing. she could come back still, but if not, then you can know you at least made part of her life better than ever before. that's not a bad thing. that's amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> everyone i have ver liked chooses someone else

everyone i have ever loved chooses someone or something else and i dont know how to cope with it

no matter how much i change and struggle and try to crawl back to positivity, it's never enough

i love a girl that i will call Quart. I've liked her since june and i've loved her since october, but first she was dating someone else and then she was trying to date someone else who absolutely shattered her heart and almost broke her spirit, and now she doesn't like anyone, or she doesn't think she does

five or six months now

she knows my feelings. she has since august. i told her, and when my feelings developed more, i kept her updated. she doesn't mind. she didn't mind. she hates that she can't get over the last guy. 

but someone new. he promised he wasn't going to go after her, but he kissed her this past week and she kissed back but she didn't like him but he likes her, and i can't process anything. she doesn't like anyone she keeps saying she doesn't but i can't help feeling that she will choose him 

nothing i do is ever enough

not for anyone

i feel like im going to die alone

i hate that i get like this. i hate how pathetic i end up looking and feeling. i wish i could just let go and not care at all, but when she's around me i'm happier than i've been in years, and i'm trying so hard to just be happy that way on my own, trying so hard not to make her being around me an obligation or a need, because i hate feeling like i'm some sort of burden, i hate feeling like i'm not happy without her

i want to be happy with her

i can't shake the feeling that he is going to keep trying to do things with her, and eventually she will start to like it, and eventually she will like him, and knowing that she chose someone else again, knowing that i wasn't good enough again, knowing that i'll never have a chance with her- that will hurt. but then wagtching more and more of her time go to him, watching myself fade into the background, becoming a fall back, it will kill me and i won't know what to do anymore

i'm fucking helpless

matters of the heart are impossible

you can't do anything to fucking change them

when he's not around her it's fine, i wait, im patient, im calm

but i know no one ever chooses me

ever

if there s compettion im going to be passe dup

because im never good enough

i feel sick sometimes, i feel fineothers, i feel beyond confident sometimes, if eel like trash others

tonight i feel sick and like trash

i'm not always this way

but when i am it makes it so much harder to feel okay again and to be myself again

because even when i am happy i feel like i just want to be loved 

i give everything i can. i do everything i can. but its never enough, and im never loved back.

i justg neeed something to distract me and stop me from freaking the fuck out until tonight is over. im not suicidal i just cant handle being alone with my thoughts on nights like these </TEXT>
