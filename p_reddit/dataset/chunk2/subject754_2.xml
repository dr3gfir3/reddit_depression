	<TEXT> You'll need access to a circular saw or a table saw, preferably a drill press but a handheld drill would work if you're careful, a few drill bits, some clamps, a straight edge, some [G-flex epoxy](http://www.westsystem.com/ss/g-flex-epoxy/), an old paintbrush or two, and a [voile split kit](http://www.voile.com/voile-splitboard-hardware/voile-split-kit-diy.html). 

All you have to do is cut down the middle, drill a handful of holes, epoxy the edges, set in your hardware, and epoxy everything in place. It's all very simple if you've worked with these tools in any manner before. The trickiest part is drilling all the holes straight through the board, but it is made exponentially easier with a drill press. 

If you're interested in doing it yourself, check out this 2 part video. It's super informative and will walk you through every step of the process. If it seems like something you can do, give it a shot!

	<TEXT> Honestly, basically the only cost difference between a premade splitty and a homemade one is the time and effort put in. It's a time intensive process for a niche market, so it's going to be relatively expensive. I knew a few friends who would offer to split boards for people, but for the labor price it was almost more economical to get a pre-made board. And I know they've closed up shop since, and I haven't found any more manufacturers like them around.

For me, I wanted a project, and I wanted to be able to get places on snow faster. I have the skills required to make a board (and not too many skills are required), so I knew I could do it. If you're not sure you can make one yourself, I would just buy a pre made one. It's only a little bit more expensive (after you factor in the cost of your board), and you get a much nicer ride and touring quality. 

If you're just looking to save money and not do any work, take a look on craigslist. Pick up a used setup for cheap, sometimes they'll even come with some extra goodies like crampons or avvy gear thrown in </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stopped downhilling after I badly fractured my wrist, but I like full suits because there's less to move around, it keeps everything in place. It's kind of annoying to have your elbow pads twist around a bit over a day of riding. It's really personal preference, but I like having everything stay in place. It's a bit hotter, but the ease of use is nice. Definitely try one on if you can though, there's nothing worse than an ill-fitting clothes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're nice aren't they? I've got a sponsorship so I've got plenty of their stuff. It's amazing how far they've come in helmet design in just a few years. Their old helmets are moderately heavy and have fair ventilation, but their new ones feel like nothing at all, and their designs are much better now in my opinion. They sell some good shin pads as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ride bike trails and such, but I also ride trials (hopping onto/off of big rocks, park tables, skinnies, etc), and that's usually in a more populated area like a park or something. Definitely more exposure there, but mountain unicycling is more fun to me. And here in Colorado there's quite a few people on the trails on a nice day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've got a 2006 Torker DX, and it's been holding up admirably (and I've put that thing through some hell). It's a bit heavier than nicer brands like Kris Holm unis, but they're built like a bomb and are relatively cheap. The newer versions are *considerably* nicer than the one I've got, and they're about the same price. 

http://www.unicycle.com/torker-dx-20-inch-trials.html

If you're looking to do muni only I'd get a 24" wheel, but if you want to do a bit of everything you can't go wrong with a 20" wheel. They're nice and light and have the most support with respect to wheels, tires, tubes, etc.  </TEXT>

Send some emails, say that you're an attention getter (any unicyclist is), and that you could garner tons of attention for *insert company name here* if they would sponsor you.   </TEXT>

The only thing I use it for is opening beer bottles. It works pretty well in that department. 1saleaday.com is by far the best freebie site. I've ordered 2 things there (including this multitool), and both have arrived extremely fast. 

Overall review: free is free. The only thing I use this for is opening bottles, and it does a fair job of it. Go for it by all means, but don't expect to fix your car or induce nuclear fission with it </TEXT>

And lastly, both AKs and ARs eject in the opposite direction, so even if the casings were correct, the rifle is pointing in the wrong direction.

	<TEXT> Honestly, just find a competition in your area and show up one time.  Help set up stages, email the director, just show that you're interested. Almost everyone I've met in action shooting is super nice and helpful. Not too many people shoot action competitions so it's always fun to see someone new. It is a bit costly, but it's so damn fun that after just one match you'll be hooked. 

Each competition you'll be shooting a couple hundred rounds (on average), and you'll need a handful of magazines and magazine pouches/holders.  

Pouches can get expensive, so if you're any good at sewing I'd suggest making your own. It's super easy and it'll save you *quite* a bit of coin. I started shooting 3-gun so you need 2 more guns worth of gear. That's why I started making my own stuff.

I made a post about sewing your own awhile ago, check it out. I can give you some tips if this seems interesting for you. I made a whole 3-gun setup including belt for less than $10. I am by no means a good sewer, so it's something almost anyone can do.

	<TEXT> Get yourself some digital* calipers. It's pretty much essential if you're doing any machining. And if you're curious about the dimensions of anything, just whip out your calipers and know its dimensions up to 3 decimal points!

	<TEXT> First, find some [5/8" SAE flat washers](http://www.engineering.com/Library/ArticlesPage/tabid/85/ArticleID/118/Washer-Size-Chart.aspx). They're pretty cheap from a hardware store, and you only need 5-10 of them depending on the length of your average turd. These will be the baffles.

Once this is done, you need to buy a piece of [1-5/16" OD tube](http://www.speedymetals.com/showproduct.aspx?productid=3457) and cut it into 3/8" pieces. These will be the spacers.

Next, you need to get 12" of [1-5/16 ID pipe](http://www.onlinemetals.com/merchant.cfm?pid=7562 step=4 showunits=inches id=283 top_cat=0) (you can cut it down to fit later). This will be the sheath that holds everything together.

To assemble the device, first weld a washer to one of the open ends of your sheath. Then, alternately layer your 3/8" pieces of tubing and your washers. To cap off your creation, set your final washer in place, cut the sheath flush with this final washer, and weld it in place. Finally, be sure to grind down your welds and deburr everything. You want a silky smooth exterior of your device. 

Congratulations, you have finished creating your shit silencer. Simply insert into your rectum and enjoy your effortless shits, silent farts, and greatly reduced cleanup.

	<TEXT> I'm carrying in [one of these](http://www.shieldedholsters.com/inventory/item.php?id=11). And my belt is just a leather belt. 

I really like the holster, and I think my belt is just fine for holding everything up. Shirts and things just tend to print on the gun super easily. If I've got another layer on top of my shirt it's almost invisible, but with just a t-shirt it's super obvious that I either have a pistol or some crazy cancerous growth. Carrying in the winter is easy, but I'd like the ability to carry year round </TEXT>
