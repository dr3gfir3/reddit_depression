	<TEXT> Herpes can lie dormant for months before the anti-bodies show up in  a blood test. Unfortunately, unless you tested negative before sex with your new partner, there's really no way to pinpoint him as the one who exposed you.

Also, herpes outbreaks are more prone during periods of immunity weakness. The healthier you are, the less likely you'll have an outbreak. Lastly, herpes is only a skin condition, not much different from acne or eczema. The social stigma is far worse than herpes itself.

2.It is fair to say that a person may experience cognitive dissonance while they are acting out their own defense mechanisms. Cognitive dissonance means people are biased to think of their behavior as correct, despite it being destructive or irrational.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's never wise to generalize. There are sad strip clubs, and wonderful strip clubs. There are drug-addicted strippers and degree holding strippers. I think the only semi-fair generalization to make about strippers is that they most likely aren't trust-fund babies. They've probably worked their asses off their whole lives to pay their bills, just like anyone else who doesn't have it all handed to them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wasn't intending to imply gender bias, I was merely replying within the context of his question. To clarify, let's say *person A* initiates a non-touching flirtatious interaction with *person b*, I think the initiator should make their interest known in a non-touching way. However, perhaps person B could reciprocate the flirting with a giggle and a light graze of the arm, or a very playful, casual touch. No touching first, invitation instead.  </TEXT>
