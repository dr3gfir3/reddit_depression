	<TEXT> I was 22, she was 30. I was a little chubby and she was slim, blonde, polish and 6 foot. Met at work and immediately as rely assumed she was waaaaay out of my league so I just stated being myself around her. It worked!

It started out great, she thought I was a carefree guy she can be herself with, I thought she was more mature than the usual 20 year old girl I was getting sick of.

I was right, she was wrong. Clich of a relationship of course but she became clingy, jealous and very possessive. Sex wasn't great either even though she was physically stunning. </TEXT>
