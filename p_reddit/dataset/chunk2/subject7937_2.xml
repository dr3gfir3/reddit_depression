	<TEXT> So I've recently been obsessed with fountain pens which (after hours of internet surfing) has lead me to calligraphy; today a few of the pens I ordered came in - including this badass pilot parallel. I've never calligraphed in my life before although I've spent a lot of my life tagging, so here's my very first ever attempt (I know I'm missing an 'L' sorry). http://i.imgur.com/ITfPsRh.jpg </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks. yeah, i do have a couple rimless glasses but I guess i've just grown tired of the style - i ended up going with fatheadz, turns out what i'm really looking for are glasses that have a total eye-width of 60mm or more. the sales person i spoke with said she's run into many situations (especially men) where the patient needed/wanted wider frames but designers don't ever seem to accommodate for them, having a really heavy prescription doesn't help either =/ </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-01-10 21:44:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It feels like I'm the only person out there that really misses having a bunch of high-quality pre-rendered FMV cutscenes. Sure, with the current state hardware in-engine cutscenes look worlds better than what we used to have but pre-rendered has evolved as well! I recently beat Dark Souls hoping there'd be an epic ending similar to the intro FMV but was severely disappointed with a 30sec in-engine animation; yes I understand it's "more immersive" with my custom character but I want to be rewarded with "ooh's" and "ahh's" throughout the story. Am I crazy or am I just nostalgic for the days of FFVII where cutscenes were blowing my mind? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Forgive me for my ignorance but how in the world do I take advantage of 3D Vision on PC? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-10-02 21:30:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a GTX 670 and my PC is hooked up via HDMI to a Samsung D7000 series 3D TV. My google-fu isn't fairing well with how I'd enable 3D Vision, I've come across this: 

http://3dvision-blog.com/8394-how-to-get-the-best-stereo-3d-experience-in-borderlands-2/

and followed through to: 

http://helixmod.blogspot.com/2012/09/borderlands-2-3d-vision-patch.html

but I have no idea where to start to enable 3D Vision. I tried clicking on "Enable 3D Vision" in the Nvidia folder then run the game but it turns off after hitting "Play" at the splash screen; it's not supposed to be in the game settings is it? There doesn't seem to be any clear tutorials out there, hoping reddit could help. I currently have everything "maxed out" in video settings but nothing seems to be working.

I've never tried 3D PC gaming so all of this is relatively new to me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Yesterday marked my 5 year anniversary of involuntary single life and living alone (a TLDR open rant) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-20 21:52:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not looking for karma or anything, this post is purely therapeutic.

I'm one of those *cheesy/hopeless romantic/chivalry's not dead* types who has has now been single for 5 years, 5 years since I've even been on a date let alone kiss a girl or even held a girls hand. I'm 28 now and I've only had 4 girlfriends my entire life (3 of which were relationships) the last of which ended quite horribly. 

My most recent ex moved in with me before we even got together (I've been completely independent since I was 17), we were together for 4 years: obviously living together for a little while longer than that, bought a car together and one day I bought a town home for her  a few months after the purchase of an overpriced town home (we got it right before the market collapsed) she decided she can't handle not being able to go shopping every weekend and at the same time her parents had just opened up a business in PA, she tells me she needs to go help her parents in PA (we live in CO, her parents had moved to PA about two years into our relationship) and we agreed on trying the long distance relationship thing, in not even a week after her moving to help her parents with the business her and her family suddenly leave the country for a couple months, we promised to keep in contact while she vacationed overseas but I ended up hearing from her once during this time for a brief moment on yahoo chat, even the short e-mails I sent about every 10 days were never responded to. She finally comes stateside and I texted her "welcome back" and it takes her over a week to respond "thanks"; shortly after this I receive a myspace message from her, a message that barely constitutes as a paragraph breaking up with me  yes, she ended our 4-year-living-together-relationship in a tiny myspace message. There were no signs of serious turmoil or distress in the relationship before this and it was over just like that, no rhyme or reason.

A month passes and I get laid off, the company I was currently designing for filed bankruptcy and had laid off 70% of the workforce and later completely went out of business closing every retail store in the nation. I become unemployed for the next two years which adds to the depression and stress which finally ends up causing my current foreclosure on the town home. When it rains, it fucking pours. To be clear, I fought tooth and nail and exhausted every option I could to keep the town house.

I've been living alone the last 5 years and it's one of the most depressing things I've had to endure. Being single with a roommate or living with family is one thing but living completely alone is a whole different story, although I did manage to get a cat a couple years ago but I think that's irrelevant. Anyhow, just last week I moved into an old rundown apartment and settling in is as hard as ever not to mention the packing and moving! Quite a downgrade from the town home I had, everything is old and unfamiliar, unpacking and setting up is a chore, no air conditioning makes everything worse and the paper-thin walls make the it seem like my neighbors are in my home, oh and did I mention that there's a train that comes by every 2 hours? Sorry, I digress, I could *almost* tolerate being alone in a familiar place but now in unknown territory it's a blatant punch to the face constantly reminding me just how lonely my life is.

At this age it feels impossible to meet new people let alone meeting members of the opposite sex who don't have kids. My friends are no help because during the early stages of the single life I fell into a younger crowd (some of them are just now turning 19); these young friends of mine if aren't single, have girlfriends who are the type to say "I dont hang out with girls" so there's no help there; the single ones are bringing around even younger single girls: 16-18 which feels a bit too young for someone who'll be 29 in November not to mention that there's almost no common ground; my work as a designer has landed me in a position where I'm one of the youngest in the company, everyone around me is in their 40's (married, divorced, old, etc.); night clubs and bars are all full of women who are there strictly to dance or are there for their girlfriends celebrating some sort of occasion and are not at all open to being asked out (IMO these places are a terrible place to pick up women: screaming at a girl when you first meet her cannot be good). I've tried plenty free online dating sites none of which has landed taken me anywhere, what the heck else is there to do?

Heading into this fifth year has made me question everything! I seem to be too nice, trying to be an asshole just doesn't fit me, I can't just up and completely change my personality and adopt being an asshole. Was I some sort of rapist the past life and am now being punished for it? What have I done to be punished like this? Why is it that I've got all this pent-up love and no chance to share it? Growing up geek and nerdy makes it hard for me to dumb down to gossipy *jersey shore* types, would I be happier dumber? Ignorance is bliss isn't it? I was built to love, I never knew what *cooties* were as a child, I can even remember my first crush in the 2nd grade. I have always pursued being/becoming the best boyfriend any girl has ever known - I am meticulously observant of my past relationships and others as to avoid all mistakes, I am terrible at being single but I make an awesome significant other: I don't smoke, I'm an accomplished chef, I'm artistic, professional designer, musically inclined, smart, educated, sensitive, funny, passionate, dedicated, determined, independent, love kids - I don't mean to toot my own horn here but the list goes on and on. I'll always put her first but am extremely self conscious not to smother her, I don't think I'm overweight, I'm 5'10 and semi-athletic, I don't think I'm short, I'm super open minded and I basically have no one who thinks ill of me (well at least not to my knowledge). I don't think it's a confidence issue - physical appearance is the only thing I can't subjectively judge myself on besides body mass and in that category I don't think's an issue, I may not have washboard abs but I don't have no buddha belly.

These past 5 years have lead me to become this emotional wreck inside although it's covered with a flawless facade that I've been perfecting since day one I assure you I'm truly dying inside, for example at times of watching "How I met your mother" it will occasionally make me tear up like a little girl because I feel so much for some of the situations; I've been so jaded that seeing any couple (fictional or real-life) makes me feel like a they're mocking my very existence and jabbing at how much of failure my relationship status has been. Now I've gotten this irrationalization that I'm in the wrong locale, that I can't meet women because I'm in Colorado, that Silicon Valley, NYC, Toronto or Tokyo is where I was meant to be - it sends me into an even deeper into the spiral knowing that I'll never leave a stable job to pursue any of these places. My mind always feels like it's running a mile a minute thinking about how shitty this life is (and here I thought my depression was supposed to subside after the teenage life). 

Inside I'm curled up in the alone in the dark yearning contact outside of friendship, hoping to discard the mask and finally have some sort of direction in my life but after five years of this my legs are starting to buckle and as I near 30 I'm starting to just doubt all of life; what's the point of anything if you can't intimately share it with someone? I mean at this point I'd settle for being friendzoned, hell, just being able to hang out with people that share common passions would be nice - don't get me wrong I absolutely love my friends and wouldn't trade them for the world but none of them truly have any common ground with me. There isn't even anyone close to being a potential girlfriend, I'd feel slightly better if I even had a crush on someone, at least then I'd have some sort of direction to go in, some sort of goal I could try and achieve. I am extremely self-conscious and I know I'm overly fixated on the situation but after 5 long freaking years of this bullshit I can't help but to do so. It just feels hopeless, utterly, utterly hopeless  end rant.


I know no one will read this especially because it's especially TLDR but writing it and having it public outside of people who know me makes me feel a nano bit better.  </TEXT>
