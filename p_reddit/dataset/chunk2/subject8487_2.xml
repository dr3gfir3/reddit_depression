	<TITLE> The seemingly unavoidable fallout of job-stealing robots... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-15 04:09:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When most of us are jobless due to the automating of the vast majority of industries, what will we all do with ourselves?  

Side note for this question: I'm making the assumption that, at some point, universal basic income will be a reality and we won't be dying in the streets.

A decent portion of the population, I would wager, have some to most of their identity's wrapped up in their careers-  the thought that we'll all just kick back and enjoy life seems overly optimistic.

Does anyone else see this as a slow descent into dystopia vs. utopia?  
If I'm seeing this completely wrong and there are other opinions, I would love to hear them because I feel that us, losing our abilities to work for a living, will be a paradigm shift that we might take a looonnng time in being able to cope with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any ideas on why iTunes music albums wouldn't sync to my iPhone 5.  All software is up to date.   
I bought an album, added it to an existing playlist and clicked sync- nothing transferred.  
I then created the albums own playlist and synced that- the folder showed up but it was blank.  
Anyone run into this and successfully resolve it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pessimism in futurology outlook. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-03 16:55:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Has anyone noticed the contrast of opinions between futurologists and professionals in the fields as to what the future might yield?  
Two primary examples being, will we cure cancer and will we ever achieve immortality ?  I GENERALLY find a high proportion of optimism about the answer to such questions being "yes" when reading articles by someone such as Ray Kurzweil or by posts on this subreddit ( again, generally speaking) - but when I speak to my friends who are IN the medical field, such as Dr.'s and Nurses, the outlook is considerably more grim.  

Any idea why this is or who stands to be correct?

EDIT: Today (2/4) from CNN- this is a prime example of what I'm talking about.

	<TEXT> At a Tennessee Football Game---not a joke
 
Christianity is now the target of persecution...
 
THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS! GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO READS THIS AND PASSES IT ON.
 
I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT A HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL CAN SEE THE PROBLEM, BUT OUR SOCIETY CANNOT.


Tennessee Football
This is a statement that was read over the PA system at the football game at Roane County High School , Kingston , Tennessee, by school principal, Jody McLeod 

"It has always been the custom at Roane County High School football games, to say a prayer and play the National Anthem, to honor God and Country." 

Due to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court, I am told that saying a Prayer is a violation of Federal Case Law. As I understand the law at this time, I can use this public facility to approve of sexual perversion and call it "an alternate life style," and, if someone is offended, that's OK. 

I can use it to condone sexual promiscuity, by dispensing condoms and calling it, "safe sex." If someone is offended, that's OK. 

I can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an unborn baby as a "viable" means of birth control." If someone is offended, no problem... 

I can designate a school day as "Earth Day" and involve students in activities to worship religiously and praise the goddess, "Mother Earth", and call it "ecology.." 

I can use literature, videos and presentations in the classroom that depicts people with strong, traditional Christian convictions as "simple minded" and "ignorant" and call it "enlightenment.." 

However, if anyone uses this facility to honor GOD and to                                  ask HIM to bless this event with safety and good sportsmanship, then Federal Case Law is violated. 

This appears to be inconsistent at best, and at worst, diabolical.Apparently, we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone, except GOD and HIS Commandments. 

Nevertheless , as a school principal, I frequently ask staff and students to abide by rules with which they do not necessarily agree. For me to do otherwise would be inconsistent at best, and at worst, hypocritical. I suffer from that affliction enough unintentionally. I certainly do not need to add an intentional transgression. 

For this reason, I shall "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's," and refrain from praying at this time. 

" However, if you feel inspired to honor, praise and thank GOD and ask HIM, in the name of JESUS, to bless this event, please feel free to do so.. As far as I know, that's not against the law--yet." 

One by one, the people in the stands bowed their heads, held hands with one another and began to pray. 

They prayed in the stands. They prayed in the team huddles. They prayed at the concession stand and they prayed in the Announcer's Box! 

The only place they didn't pray was in the Supreme Court of the United States of America- the Seat of "Justice" in the "one nation, under GOD." 

Somehow, Kingston , Tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten. We are given the Freedom OF Religion, not the Freedom FROM ReligionPraise GOD that HIS remnant remains!
