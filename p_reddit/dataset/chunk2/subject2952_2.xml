	<TEXT> This is true. I rolled my NL shadow 701x about 35 times last night to get a good roll, pretty satisfied now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been thinking this for a while, almost all other games have something else to do besides just shooting/killing things EDIT - this includes punching/palming/knifing. I want some Destiny vices (EDIT I know these aren't all vices). For example;

- Casinos with common games we have today as well as new destiny gambling games - Bungie would probably need to increase glimmer cap for this - but you could have a new currency, casino tokens or something, which you could trade for varying levels of gear. e.g. 100 for a rare weapon, 1000 for a legendary, 10000 for an exotic.

- Sparrow racing, with betting on these races included.

- an exotic dancing club, showcasing all the best that the different races of exo/awoken/human have to offer - every guardian needs to unwind right? - maybe add a bar too with all the finest intergalactic beverages.
- A museum or something similar where you can get to grips with the lore of the destiny world without having to go on your laptop to read Grimoire cards
- a shooting range where you can go to test out all weapons and see what you think of them, perhaps whilst you are there all the perks for that weapon are activated temporarily to allow you to get a feel for what they will be like when upgraded or if you need to re-roll them.

Personally I would envisage these things to be in the city rather than the tower to try and give us a little more to explore as well other things to do. I'm sure we all have many more ideas than I have listed but it would be nice to do something else. </TEXT>
