	<TEXT> I just recently got a PT and it's the best decision I have made. I would echo everyone on here though and say to find an experienced trainer, as there are some deadweights out there. My trainer has a discussion with me about nutrition every day and then goes into my workouts, he even designed a plan for me to workout on days when he isn't with me. Best use of my money to date.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doing the same but with a personal trainer, knowing I'm paying a ton of cash towards something keeps me motivated and holds me accountable. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I had a solid discussion with my personal trainer last night and he agreed that this is completely normal (not having appetite when beginning a weight training regimen) so I'm not too concerned yet. Now if in another month I still feel this way, maybe.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I'm at the point now where I started hardcore exercising and my appetite is practically non-existent. I have to force feed myself at times. Stick with it, it will get better!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Crush Your Resolutions...My 80lb Weight Loss </TITLE>

	<TEXT> M/22/250, around six feet tall. September of 2014 I started out weighing about 331 and was just absolutely miserable. Started absolutely hating everything about myself. Couldn't look in a mirror, had about two solid shirts that I would wear and up and quit going out with friends because I was so ashamed. I lived on the margaritas and everything else I could fit into my mouth diet. One day I woke up, looked at myself in the mirror and had a complete breakdown. After that I decided to turn my life around and live to the age of 30. Truthfully, and this will sound stupid but I saw this picture of Chris Pratt and it really, really hit home (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/f9/29/dcf9299bbaa0efdfb73b73e69ee9dff8.jpg)

Started by writing literally everything I ate down in a journal while also keeping track on my phone. I was a big guy but consistently ate around 1,500 calories a day and between 30-50g of carbs. At the hell out of chicken, kale and eggs. I would walk for an hour every day at an incline and saw dramatic changes.

Fast forward to now, I've went down three pant sizes and two shirt sizes, dropping down to about 250lbs. I recently started with a personal trainer. He has me doing a mix of resistance/weight training with some weighted cardio mixed in. I meet with him two days a week and do strict cardio by myself on the other days. My ass is getting handed to me and I absolutely love it. My goal is by June to be at my goal weight and looking sexy af. I'm nowhere near where I want to be yet but dammit I'm a hell of a lot closer than I was a year ago. Now it's crunch time.

Point of the story, I know it's around the time for New Year's resolutions and jokes are being made about packed gyms but dammit it's nothing to joke about. If you are one of those people struggling to lose weight don't give in, keep it up. Don't think of it as a diet, think of it as a lifestyle change. Don't be embarrassed to ask for help/advice...nobody is going to judge someone actively trying to better themselves. Set goals and crush them...be a fucking lion. In the beginning it will seem like absolute hell until you start to see results, then it becomes an addiction. I promise you, if I could crawl out of the hole I dug myself, so can you dammit.

	<TEXT> Yeah but dammit I'm trying to keep the little muscle I have, not waste it all away hahaha. I'm at the opposite end of the spectrum, I wake up and the thought of eating makes me sick. </TEXT>
