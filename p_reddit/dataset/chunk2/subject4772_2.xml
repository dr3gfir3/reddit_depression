	<TITLE> In 2017 who makes it into the eight at the current 8's expense? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Was thinking about how hard it is to make a case for anyone in this years eight to miss out... but it will happen due to the impossibility of getting the same eight two years in a row.

Titans likely drop out but they have a good roster, I don't like the dogs cause of Lichaa who's a big problem for their attack but man Hasler is just always in the finals isn't he.

I'm liking the Rabbitohs, Roosters and Warriors to push their way in... Before everyone comments how the warriors will lock up 9th, they're due for finals footy and Kearny has sprinkled some magic on the test team who have been outstanding. Rabbitohs spine is one of the best in the comp, but Gurgess needs to bounce back into form since they lost Nathan Brown. Roosters were crippled at the start of the year without Pearce, Cordner and JWH also Latrell's inexperience at a key position let them down, he'll need this season on the wing for his development while Gordon provides immediate reliability.

In my eyes only the Eels, Tigers, Dragons   Knights don't have a case. When you dissect the Eels roster they are in real trouble, Robson and Degois are G.O.A.T players though so who knows. Tigers might be one of the two youngest rosters next year, no way they'll be consistent. Dragons roster got worse, no evidence to show they can turn it around. Knights self explanatory. 

Who do you guys reckon will make it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm exaggerating  and making this up but...
Warren: "The last time the dragons have beaten the rabbitohs at ANZ was in 1975, surely they won't break the hoodoo tonight"

Me: "holy shit I need to sell my house and car and bet on the rabbitohs because of a stat that has no relevance to the roster/form going into the game right now"

I can't believe that a guy who's watched soo much footy in his lifetime barely understands the sport let alone the players names who he mistakes every damn week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ive been on the piss since yesterday creating a 7l jungle juice, half of it left to go. Did my money on the horses though, there should be a law preventing drinkers to get into their sportsbet accounts.

Threw 10 on ennis for clive churchill and a multi Panthers, Cutters, Sharks. I reckon fifita   gals offloads will set the tone of the match, can the storm wrestle the offloads away? 

This will go one of two ways, storm win 1-12 or sharks 13+ depending on how well the storms defence can smother. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ray warren is gonna fire these stats of tomorrow like a semi auto as if they will factor into the result. 

Also regarding stats, they need to separate records from pre/post NRL so we can better recognize achievements. Like the biggest ever winning margin was in a time where players got signed up at the pub and smoked durries during the warm up in 1935.

The sharks 15 game streak was Huuuuuuge in the state of the NRL right now you need to have an elite roster, little/no injuries, good calls from the refs and luck to pull something like it off yet after the draw with the titans nobody but their supporters gave a shit about them after cause they couldn't surpass the (this is a off the top of my head made up fact) eastern suburbs 1968 streak of 22.

	<TEXT> I was reading over in the NFL reddit how a waiting list list for packers season ticket holders is 60,000 and people that just have had kids would put them on the waiting list cause realistically they could get to their turn in their late 20's early 30's.

I'm cool watching games on TV but if the NRL shows a big sign into ever taking off into a bigger grander competition i'm being a broncos member asap.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i would never sign a winger to a big money contract, even semi.

Cause of the incredible production of wingers, most young kids that come through do an equal job to the mature players attacking wise but face a learning curve defensively.

If skimping out on wingers meant my salary cap was bigger to retain more useful positions i'd bring through U20 wingers every 2nd season at my club. </TEXT>
