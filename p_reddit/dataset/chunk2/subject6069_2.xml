	<TEXT> Yeah, uh, he resigned to work at the White House. The past 5 jobs I've worked at? Guess what - I am still good friends with the people I worked with and for. He didn't get fired. He left specifically to work at the White House - why would you think leaving that job means he doesn't still have incredibly strong ties with that news outlet? That they wouldn't be even more friendly and compliant than they would be otherwise? THAT IS THE ISSUE! They have no claim to be anything other than a propaganda arm for the White House. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was for executive employees only, and also removed the two year ban on informal lobbying, which is the same thing as lobbying except you aren't registered as a lobbyist. Additionally it removed a two year restriction preventing executive branch employees from taking a job with an agency they had tried to influence. So that order was very limited in scope to begin with and is a total mixed bag. In many ways it's window dressing because it applies to a tiny fraction of people and it just pushes the lobbying under the table.

	<TEXT>  Colbert was taking orders from the Clinton campaign

No, the Clinton Global Initiative, back in 2013, pitched Colbert for 2 episodes that had content on the CGI University. That is not "taking orders from the Clinton campaign", as you phrase it, which would imply a much more far-reaching, insidious involvement between Colbert and the actual Clinton campaign, which the CGI U was not anyways. So if that's all you've got it's weak sauce.

To address your second point, I simply offered a warning to Trump and his supporters - don't get comfortable convincing yourselves that all this outrage is astroturfed or it's going to bite you hard in the ass in the next election cycles. However, if you feel that cavalier about the idea of changing the constitution I'm not sure how much respect you have for our system of governance anyways...

The third paragraph is more or less a rant so, OK, I understand that you feel that way. Hollywood celebrities are generally not the people to turn to for incisive political commentary or reasoned thought regardless of your political affiliation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TPP death I'll grant you, that was good, so he does have one good thing.

The lobbying ban did not apply to "politicians", only to employees of the executive branch, and it also *removed* the two year ban on informal lobbying, which is the same thing as lobbying except you aren't registered as a lobbyist. Additionally it removed a two year restriction preventing executive branch employees from taking a job with an agency they had tried to influence. So that order was very limited in scope to begin with and is a total mixed bag. In many ways it's window dressing that just pushes the lobbying under the table.

Many people have advocated for term limits, that's nothing new, but it won't happen anyways. It's an easy position to take since there's no political cost or work involved for the president - congress has to pass that themselves, and it ain't happening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that's an interesting take on it. Did the DNC donate to comedy central and HBO? First I've heard of that - otherwise I'm pretty unclear on which "party" gave "them" money to "campaign" - those are all pretty nebulous claims. Isn't it perhaps more likely that they are comedians who have an audience that they perform for that enjoys this kind of material? 

Not everyone that disagrees with you is a shill involved in a liberal conspiracy, you know, whether it's me or John Oliver - Obama learned that in the 2010 midterms after the Tea Party was largely dismissed as astroturfed but wound up sweeping congress. Trump's about to learn that lesson in 2018 and 2020 if he and his supporters keep telling themselves this is all fake outrage funded by George Soros and propagated by the leftist media elite. The voters will teach him otherwise.

Hate to say it but I'm not spending 30 minutes watching that video this time either, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His bungling of the first big move of his presidency (the immigration EO) revealed the disarray and incompetence of his administration, so I would not be at all surprised if some of his supporters were less than thrilled with him so far. Once that EO was blocked the Trump Train slowed wayyyy down. He got BTFO. Now they have a huge mess on their hands in finding an actual replacement for the ACA after promising it over and over - that's going to be a nasty fight. The investigation into the campaign's ties to Russia are stepping up after Trump kept a known liar on his national security council for more than 10 days after he found out he lied - only asking him to resign once the media got hold of it. The EO's he has signed so far have also been almost entirely symbolic, clarifying priorities for other organizations. He hasn't done much of anything, honestly, other than starting to deport mothers and fathers instead of focusing on the criminals. Tbh it's a fail so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And like the person above said... they never claimed to be fair and balanced or actual news. They claim to be comedy shows, which they are. Partisanship and comedy are not on the same spectrum - comedy doesn't have to appeal to everyone to be comedy, or to be non-partisan to be comedy. I think you are seeing some kind of negation between politics and comedy when in fact they are two items on a Venn Diagram overlapping. Bottom-line though, Trump is just a comedy goldmine, so they would be doing themselves a huge disservice not to mine that ore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's fine, but it's worth recognizing that there is a massive space between "the lowest common denominator of discomfort" and being OK with changing in a room full of people. Plenty of perfectly normal, well-adjusted people fall into the space between those two. It's not the binary system you paint it as, where normal people who go outside and socialize are on one side changing together, while all the freaks who only live to get offended about things are on the other side. There are many reasons why someone might want a bit of privacy and it's really not an indicator of either of the situations you indicate above.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I generally respect Joe's willingness to talk to anyone about anything and I like his approach. It works really, really well for most people - athletes, scientists, and comedians especially. Where it becomes less smart an idea is when you bring political ideologues on without a countering view. The people Joe has on are just able to spout off with a very occasional uninformed check by Joe, who then turns it back into a conversation about something else and typically doesn't follow up. He does well with that sometimes - but the impact of giving a platform to someone so that they can spread bullshit is a lot more significant when the information can lead people to be misinformed about serious issues vs fun stuff like MMA or comedy. I don't particularly like the "just say what you want" approach if it's an ideologue guest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember casually suggesting that there be a "guys night" at the bouldering wall in my college gym since there was a "ladies night", where for an hour only women were allowed to climb. I was told that there is no reason guys need private space like that. I can see both sides - guys can be pretty douchey, getting extra "coachey" to the chicks, constantly hitting on them, etc when they just want to climb and do their own things sometimes, so a ladies night does seem generally more justified - but at the same time, the dynamic is definitely different when it's just guys around, and I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with letting that happen if the ladies get the wall to themselves for an hour a week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, that's a cop out. Sometimes he uses obvious satire. More often he intentionally blurs the line and pretends to believe things he may or may not actually believe, but says them in a "sincere" enough way that people who actually do believe those things will walk away feeling like their ideas got an endorsement. You only have to look at who his fans are to see the truth in that. He has a far-right following for a reason, it's not an accident, and much of the time his satire is just a cloak. He is not a satirical character in the way that a comedian like Colbert was a satirical character, finding truth in the ridiculous. He just says a bunch of generally objectionable shit and people can decide for themselves which things they want to think he was serious about. </TEXT>

With guys like Gavin you peek under the bullshit to find more bullshit, and it's bullshit all the way down. </TEXT>

He is not a genuine person and also not far enough on the spectrum to be a satirical character, so he and the people who support him dismiss any criticism with "he was just kidding". He can choose at will which points he raises that should be taken seriously and which were just "trolling".

	<TEXT> Empathy involves the ability to recognize that just because I am not personally impacted by something doesn't mean I overlook it. It means that I can see what other people are going through - friends, relatives, and people I have never met - and sympathize with their struggle. So even if nothing impacted me, personally, I would still feel the way I do. I can relate to the people who are having a hard time making payments on the insurance they got through the ACA and feel that we need to pursue a solution to those problems, just as I can relate to the woman whose young child was detained at the airport due to Trump's travel ban, or to the Iraqis who helped American troops during the war but were stuck in airports trying to come to the US and in some cases sent back to Iraq, to a high likelihood of death. I do not need to be personally involved to recognize these things.

But as for me, personally:

 - Several people I know who rely on changes made to healthcare laws through the ACA have no clue what's coming down the road for them, and this uncertainty leaves them in a position where they have a difficult time planning for and proceeding with their lives, as major changes to the structure of our system will completely change their financial situations if enacted.
 - The budget proposal recently rolled out includes cutting funding for Americorps, a massively beneficial program that I am and many people I know participated it. It's an organization that does great work for communities all around the country in addition to granting experience for young people in many fields of work.
 - Environmental protections are an issue I am very passionate about as an advocate for publicly accessible outdoor space, and the future of such spaces is questionable given the new policies and staff appointed to manage them.
 - Several members of my family (extended, not nuclear) are no longer on speaking terms after the election, as any discussion devolves into gloating from the Trump supporting side and mockery of any objection to Trump's policies
 - I feel deeply uncomfortable with a first family openly bilking the government and the American people

That's "it", so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read it and watched his video as well. He confesses that the things he said were wrong. Admitting that things you said were wrong doesn't make them not wrong.

Also, nothing in the videos suggests he himself is a pedophile. Just an advocate for the virtues of pedophilia.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Tons of sexual abuse victims have felt that way during the moment, only to later realize what happened to them when they're older.

So is Milo old enough to have realized this yet? I feel like he's old enough to have realized it and can stop spreading the idea that he was the predator now, right? Because it was just last year that he said he was the predator. It's sad that it happened to him, but take his statements as a whole - listen to both podcasts - he brings out every abuser's line in the book. He excuses it not just in his individual case but in a general sense - even talks about how it's a good thing. He also claims to know many pederasts but won't reveal them or act on the knowledge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, what Milo did was go beyond his own personal experience to speak more generally about the issue. If he had kept to just talking about how he and the priest enjoyed it, it would have been weird, but not all that controversial. When it stops being OK is when you make larger pronouncements about the virtue of pedophilia in the gay community or say you know who a bunch of Hollywood pedophiles are but refuse to act on that knowledge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On JRE he said he was the predator in the situation. It seems like most people have seen either the Drunken Peasants Skype chat OR the JRE podcast. Watch both. Their combined effect is beyond the pale - although they're pretty damning individually anyways. The problem is that he is providing the exact reason that abusers give for their crimes. He does this in every conversation he inserts himself into - takes the most confrontational and controversial view on the issue. It's just that in the case of child abuse it's really not funny or OK to advocate for it like that, even for people who are OK when he does it to everyone else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have elucidated the central problem with Milo's whole persona, as I explained earlier. His fans just choose at their leisure what to believe and what not to believe, just as you are choosing to believe he was abused and that that explains his stupid, inexcusable views on pedophilia as a larger societal issue rather than just his own experience with it, while at the same time choosing not to believe that he knows the identities of pederasts (including the person who abused him - so is he making that up too, or choosing to withhold it? Can't have it both ways). You are deciding what is and isn't true in what he says to align with your own narrative. You are trying to take the high ground here, but you don't hold it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, you are more interested in the reason he delivered a stupid and dangerous message so that he can be excused for it, while I am more concerned with the content of the message and why it's dangerous regardless of the reason he delivered it, because that's far and away more important. At this point it's clear you care more about his personal story and finding an excuse for him than the wider ramifications, and I care more about the damage sending messages like this does in the wider world. 

I urge you to read the post I linked, as it does a nice job of phrasing what I've been saying this entire time, and since I can't seem to get through to you, maybe someone else's words will. He is allowed to talk about his personal story as much as he wants. Spreading messages like the ones he's spreading, given the platform he has, is dangerous, stupid, and inexcusable.

And saying the police should investigate the pederasts Milo knows the identities of is obvious. That doesn't mean he shouldn't reveal them to the police to make their investigation easier, so it's no excuse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That makes zero difference. It is incumbent upon the adult, the responsible party in that situation, not upon the child, to not engage in an inappropriate and illegal sexual relationship. The idea that 13 and 14 year olds are the "predators" taking advantage of older men is a line that has been used by abusers to defend their actions for a long time now. Even if he *felt* like he was the "predator" in his situation, he was not. It is incumbent upon the adult to not allow these situations to take place. </TEXT>

However, there does need to be a line drawn and maintained on what is disallowed. Since food industry lobbying opened up what was allowed to be purchased, I fear that too many restrictions could be exploited by the food industry as well - i.e. certain conglomerates' (corn industry, etc) products given a pass while others are restricted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you have a large platform and are speaking to a large audience, you carry more responsibility than the average person. Speaking in generalizations as he did is irresponsible and dangerous. He did not just say one stupid thing, he said several stupid things on at least two occasions. No matter where it stems from, even his own experience, it's still not OK to propagate those ideas like he did. As I said, those are arguments *used by abusers* and that's not a secret, it has been widely understood for years. If an idea is bad it is bad. When an idea is bad it should be treated as such, not given a free pass. 

The fact is this guy makes his living off of controversy so it could be that he is still processing trauma, or it could be that he knew these arguments were used by abusers and therefore it would be controversial for someone who experienced abuse to publicly espouse them - or, most likely, it's a mixture of the two. His entire career has been built of blending the line between what he actually thinks and what will get a rise out of people - it allows him to shrug off anything he doesn't want to associate himself with and then pick it back up later. This is a boy-cried-wolf situation - for years, he has taken up controversial positions intentionally, and thrived off of the blowback. He made his bed, so he gets to lie in it when people take him at his word.

	<TEXT> No, we should support positive and productive messaging and absolutely cast out dangerous and unproductive attitudes *regardless* of who holds those opinions. If he wants to talk about his own experiences in a personal way, that is fine. That's completely understandable and justifiable. People experience the world differently. 

Going beyond that and justifying it in a larger sense is not OK and is not something he gets a free pass for. He is no longer speaking for himself, and as an adult he understands that his experience is not universal. Nonetheless he spreads dangerous ideas about pedophilia that are not new. These ideas have been around for awhile and are used by abusers to justify their activity. The idea that it's good for young boys to experience older men, that some 13 year olds are OK to molest because they're "mature", that the responsibility sometimes lies with the 14 year old and not the adult in the situation. He is an adult and should carefully consider the impact of his words.

Hiding the identities of known pederasts is, once again, also not at all OK. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I said in my other reply to you, if he were speaking solely about his own experience that would be one thing. He goes far beyond it to make larger claims about the "benefits" that pedophilia offer to young boys, and makes several other statements and claims (such as personally knowing other pedophiles but refusing to act on that information) that are totally worthy of derision.

Just as being gay does not mean you have a free pass to say discriminatory, hateful stuff about gay people, neither does having been the victim of pedophilia mean you get a free pass to spread dangerous ideas about the "benefits" of molestation for other victims of it, or to protect pederasts that you know personally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If he were speaking solely about his own experience that would be one thing and would be entirely understandable. Where he steps over the line is in generalizing his experience and claiming that, in a larger sense, boys sleeping with older men is a good thing. He gives the exact justification for it that NAMBLA gives during his appearance on the Drunken Peasants podcast.

 In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men  the sort of coming of age relationships  the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable sort of rock, Yiannopoulos said.

This is no longer processing of his own experience, but justification of pedophilia in a larger sense.

That, and the claim that it's not really molestation if the 13 year old is sexually mature. He also claims to have been at several Hollywood parties where very young boys were sexually involved with older men during the JRE podcast, but has done nothing to report those people and refused to name them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So in the apology he posted, he says he is completely against pedophilia. 

 I am a gay man, and a child abuse victim, he wrote. My own experiences as a victim led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous. But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, advocacy.

Anyone watching the above video would clearly walk away thinking he is wholeheartedly defending pedophilia (even if only "in some cases" (like, 28/13)) AND saying that he was the predator (as a child) in the situation he was involved in. There is nothing jokey in the tone or content of his comments. Additionally, "deceptive editing" does not play a factor at all in the linked video, though Milo claims it did. Neither does it play a role in the comments he made on the Joe Rogan Experience - Rogan's podcasts are 3-hour long, uncut conversations with no editing whatsoever. The comments he made are not cut in any way. In both cases it's an extended conversation and the entire thing is right there, available for anyone to listen to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good point. One of the biggest sticking points with this Milo guy is that he is not arguing in good faith - that is, on any given point, he may or may not actually agree with what he's saying, and he makes little effort to clarify which views he actually supports, allowing people to run with or sideline as jokes the ideas he promotes at their leisure. But neither is what he says justifiable under the definition of satire, as his entire shtick is using his own, actual identity as a gay man with a black boyfriend as a prop to allow him to say offensive, derogatory, unproductive things. For those reasons he should not be taken seriously or viewed as a satirical character. He is just a troll. </TEXT>
