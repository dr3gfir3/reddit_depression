	<TEXT> Al-Masih ad-Dajjal (Arabic for "the false messiah"), is an evil figure and one of the biggest trials humanity will face right before the Day of Judgement.   He will claim to be Jesus (pbuh) and many people will fall for his tricks and begin to worship him as God. 

Narrated Ibn Umar: Once Allah's Apostle stood amongst the people, glorified and praised Allah as He deserved. Then, mentioning Dajjal, he said, "I warn you against him (i.e. the Dajjal) and there was no prophet but warned his nation against him. No doubt, Noah warned his nation against him but I tell you about him something of which no prophet told his nation before me. You should know that he is one-eyed, and Allah is not one-eyed."

	<TEXT> I'd like to shed some light on this:  

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was born in the 19th century and considered himself to be the Messiah.  Now we all know that the messiah has to defeat the dajjal, but who could possibly be considered the anti-Christ if the messiah arises during this time? Ghulam Ahmad therefore concluded that the **Christian clergy living in the West** to be the strongest proponent against Islam during his time, so he considered them to be the greatest Dajjal.  He says in his book by misinterpreting the Quran that: *"The Holy Quran then specifies that in the latter days the Christians will dominate the earth, and they shall be the cause of all kinds of mischief running rampant."* Ghulam Ahmad also considered Satan, European philosophers and a bunch of other people to also be dajjals.  It's important to note that Ahmadis believe in many Dajjals and even the possibility of other messiahs (it's weird, i know).

[You can check out the chapter of Dajjal in Ghulam Ahmad's book here.](http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/279/mode/1up)

	<TEXT>  Lies! There are no musts, there is a possibility another Messiah may come, but the seeds for the defeat of the Dajjal have been sown already.

Wrong once again. Here is a list of proofs against your claim.

"Then Jesus son of Marry will descend at the white minaret to the east of Damascus. He will then catch him up at the date of Ludd and kill him." - Sunan Abi Dawud 4321

"The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty - I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble 'Urwa b Mas'ud. He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no rancour between two persons." -Sahih Muslim 2940

"Son of Maryam (Mary) will kill the Dajjal at the door of LUD." Imam Tirmidhi(d.279/857)

"It may be asked: Jesus, son of Mary, was to come to vanquish the Dajjal, and if it is you who have come in the spirit of Jesus, son of Mary, who then is the Dajjal against you? My answer is that, though I admit the possibility of another Messiah son of Mary coming after me, and he may even be the promised one in the context of some Ahadith, and a Dajjal may also come to mislead the Muslims, yet my belief is that so far there has not been any Dajjal like the Christian clergy of these days, nor shall there ever be till the Day of Judgement." -Mirza Ghulam Ahmad


"Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus, son of Maryam (Mary) would descend and would lead them to prayer. When the enemy of Allah would see him, He would (dI`sappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by His hand and He would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ)." Imam Muslim (d.261/839)

  Look how he organised a tiny jamaat like ours to be a force... 

That's fine.  But you didn't answer the question.  How did he reform **Islam**?

 The Qur'an doesn't say many things, doesn't mean they didn't happen.

Exactly! So can you prove to me how the Quran says Jesus (pbuh) did not ascend above?

	<TEXT>   Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is the Messiah and Mahdi promised to us in the Qu'ran and that he is the metaphorical second coming of Jesus Christ (AS).

This isn't true. Even Ahmadiyya beliefs point out that another Messiah (NOT Mirza Ghulam Ahmad) must come in order to defeat the Dajjal, since the dajjal isn't defeated.

 rather his purpose was to reform Islam back to its original state as it was under the Prophet.

And what exactly did he reform?

 We also believe Hadhrat Isa was not actually raised to heaven, as evidenced by the Qu'ran and many precedents Allah the Almighty has set before.

The Quran never says Jesus (pbuh) traveled to India and died there. We know from Hadith that Jesus (pbuh) will kill the Dajjal before the Last Day. </TEXT>

I sincerely spent many days reading through ahmadiyya literature, going to their subreddit, asking many questions, conversing with other ahmadis in order to find out what they truly believe or whether or not they are telling the truth.  And i came to the same conclusion.  I still welcome any ahmadis to talk to me about their faith, but i rarely visit their subreddit after they were unable to answer my questions and they deleted some of my posts. 


  why do Muslims call other Muslims nonbelievers if the only one who can ultimately judge this is Allah azawajel?

Allah commanded us to follow Muhammad (pbuh), not Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. 

Even their prophet, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad calls you and me: non-Muslims because we don't accept his prophethood.  </TEXT>

Can I ask how this is so? From what I learned, the ahmadiyya community don't consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be The Messiah, but rather 'a Messiah'.  Since Dajjal hasn't been defeated, more Messiahs may come in the future.  This is contrasted with the beliefs of Sunni/Shia Muslims, Christians and Jews who only believe in a single Messiah. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good portion of Ahmadi texts are close to what mainstream Muslims already believe. There is some discussion on the states of man, ego, and good character which you can also find in some Sufi books. Among the  problematic parts are when Mirza Ghulam Ahmad interprets the Quran   hadith to suit the world around him during his own lifetime in the 19th century.  So for example, in order to explain the great influence the Christian clergy had during his time, he would often refer to them as the 'Dajjal' and would refer to himself as the 'promised Messiah'.  He also made some false prophecies that involved his own death, so he wouldn't have to take any repercussions for being wrong. For example he said "I will die either in Mekkah or Medina" but he died in India instead and so ahmadis have to come up with their own way to interpret his prophecies to mean something else. 

I made a short list of some strange statements i found in an ahmadiyyah book, called ["The Essence of Islam" here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1vltgo/some_questions_for_the_ahmadiyya_community/). </TEXT>

Well of course you shouldn't.  But there will be people every now and then who interpret the Quran in a controversial way that only makes sense to them and that goes in contradiction with another part of the faith.  Sometimes these interpretations can lead a group to the point where they are now considered to be following a whole new religion. This certainly happened among the Christians and it has also happened among the Muslims.

	<TEXT> 1. Paper and other means of recording were not prevalent worldwide.  Also, literacy rate was very low.

2. How do you explain that fact that others beside the people next to Prophet (pbuh) also saw the moon split?

3. Can you show proof that people from India saw it? 

4. Zakir Naik NEVER says in his video that the moon splitting was not literal. He just talks about how it's not necessary to prove to non-Muslims that this miracle took place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The paragraph leading to this quote advises men to be exemplary role models for their women, and gender roles. When used in context it is clear what the writer is intending to convey when he says* (women are the root of idol worship, for they are naturally devoted to decoration and ornaments. This is why idolatry started with women.)*. The writer is clearly not wrong when he says women are naturally drawn to jewelry and ornaments, and some who are not religious idolize their worldly possessions to an extent that it mimics worship.

**Thank you for proving my point.**

Looks like you don't understand what 'Out of context' is. [This is quoting out of context:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_quoting_out_of_context)  For example, the ad copy for New Line Cinemas 1995 thriller Se7en attributed to Owen Gleiberman, a critic for Entertainment Weekly, used the comment a small masterpiece. Gleiberman actually gave Se7en a B overall and only praised the opening credits so grandiosely: The credit sequence, with its jumpy frames and near-subliminal flashes of psychoparaphernalia, is a small masterpiece of dementia.

Now tell me how the surrounding paragraphs changes the meaning of the line: "Women are the root of idol worship".  Or do you agree that women are indeed the root of idol worship? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you're writing is utter bullshit.

Sunni Muslims arent the only muslims in the world. There is a significant part of the world which is Shia. They were not united EVER, after the death of the Holy Prophet PBUH. In fact, they killed each other with pleasure.

Whereas the Ahmadi Muslims are more united than the "Muslims" in Muslim countries. And as the number of Ahmadis grow, they all unite under one Caliph.

Death IS glorified. Fidayeen.. do you know that that is? Look it up. Muslims are synonymous with suicide attacks. Majority of Pakistanis at least were FOR suicide bombings. What does that tell you?

But again, stop wasting my time. I just dont have the patience of a priest required to address stupidity of your level.

Along with a leader, the less followers you have, the easier it is to be unified.  Look at how unified the Nation of Islam is and look at how unified religious cults are.  On the other hand you have sunni Muslims who are nearing a billion and have no leader.  What did you expect?

You have a big misunderstanding.  Islam =/= Muslims.
Just because some Muslims commit crimes does not mean that Islam supports their actions.

Similarly, just because you are using bad language, does not mean that the ahmadiyya community supports using bad language. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I believe the sole reason why Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad has to be a prophet was because of the establishment of a caliphate. Muslims have to be united under a Caliph, that is what everyone says.

Sunni Muslims had a khalipha before and after Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.  And they certainly weren't united after Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's death.

 In mainstream Islam, death is glorified as the best thing ever. But if everyone died, who is going to do God's work? 

That's just a misunderstanding on your part. 

 *Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "None of you should wish for death. If he does good, he may increase in it, and if he does evil, he may turn in repentance." [Agreed upon. This is the version of al-Bukhari]* </TEXT>

Muslims are united against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. And if you truly feel that there isn't anything to discuss, then feel free Not preaching to others as well.


  One thing I don't understand from the Muslim anti-Ahmadiyya forces is that we are basically calling people towards Allah and his Prophet(phuh) and we are being preventing from doing so from people who supposedly also believe in Allah and his Prophet(pbuh).

lol don't try to sidestep away from the area of contention.  The problem is NOT that you are calling to Allah and his messenger (pbuh) but rather that you are calling to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.  And who are these "Muslim anti-Ahmadiyya forces" you speak of?

  we should concentrate on strengthening our relationship with Allah rather than pointing out flaws in others because on the day of judgement it will be our own deeds which will determine our fate not what others were up to.

Perhaps you have misunderstood me.  I am not speaking against your actions. I am speaking out against *the message you preach*. If the Ahmadiyya community spends effort preaching their faith to others, why not start with me? </TEXT>

Edit: There are also some mistakes in that message.

 lives by the motto "love for all, hatred for none"

Yes this is the ahmadiyya motto, but there is certainly hate in ahmadiyya texts regarding certain groups that disagree.  Some ahmadi's left some not-so-loving comments about r/islam just [a few hours ago.](http://i.imgur.com/ZS2Y4nO.png)

 There are 73 sects within Islam and i belong to the r/ahmadiyya Muslims sect.

One may infer from this part that the Muslims in the world are split into 73 sects, with ahmadiyya being one of them.  However this is far from reality.  I have yet to hear from one mainstream Muslim scholar that would consider the ahmadiyya to be a sect. [More about it from this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fDXifZ5jnY)

 Ahmadiyya Muslims Community is the fastest growing sect of Islam.

In terms of total number, i'm pretty sure both Sunni   Shia Muslims have each gained a lot more followers in the last 100 years than the ahmadiyya community.

 Just a side note, the commentary is necessary as Islam has two texts....

Except that Ahmadiyya commentary that is referenced is NOT necessary.  Along with a good portion of correct information, the referenced commentary also includes "hidden meanings of verses" that apparently only the ahmadiyya can decipher and would be considered completely wrong by mainstream scholars.

	<TEXT>  if your posts aren't allegations

I said you are making **false** allegations against me. By saying i take something out of context, you should be able to prove it. (I am still waiting for this proof.)

**And how can you say I am taking something out of context and at the same time ask me for the context (you asked for book and page number)?** Will you not reason?

 you are a nobody sitting on a high horse 

...and you say i'm disrespectful while insulting me? I stated facts, but you made false statements. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually the ahmadiyya community must also believe in a Messiah to come:

**"It may be asked: Jesus, son of Mary, was to come to vanquish the Dajjal, and if it is you who have come in the spirit of Jesus, son of Mary, who then is the Dajjal 
against you? My answer is that, though I admit the possibility of another Messiah son of Mary coming after me, and he may even be the promised one in the context of 
some Ahadith, and a Dajjal may also come to mislead the Muslims, yet my belief is that so far there has not been any Dajjal like the Christian clergy of these days, nor shall there ever be till the Day of Judgement." -Mirza Ghulam Ahmad**

Even from an ahmadiyya perspective, the Dajjal (Christian clergy) have not been defeated yet and therefore a Messiah is still to come.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is this islamic 7 heaven model real?

No. It's not like we have a definite measure for what a Heaven consists of or a detailed explanation of the physical properties of each Heaven.

So we don't just start forming our own conclusions like: "2nd heaven=moon, 3rd heaven=mercury, etc." and then probably use that as a refutation against religion.  

If anything, that's just a refutation against YOUR UNDERSTANDING of the 7 heavens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  you go and find out of context lines from Ahmadiyya books, 

Which line is out of context??? Can you tell me how the context changes the meaning of each line?

 then get refuted 

Who refuted me? Where are these refutations?

 Ahmadiyyat grow, just as everyone has witnessed the growth of Ahmadiyyat over the last 100 years.

Many religious groups are growing, what's your point?

 Try your best to refute all the evidence presented in support of Ahmadiyyat.

If you want me to take a look at that, how about responding to all the quotes i just posted first?

And try not to delete my posts, okay? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know, they've convinced themselves that there are more prophets after Muhammad (pbuh) by getting around pretty much every proof against them. 

Although their proof is weak, they are obstinate in this position.  Perhaps it's easier to just point out all the non-prophet-like stuff Mirza Ghulam Ahmad said as i have done [in this topic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1vltgo/some_questions_for_the_ahmadiyya_community/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can only imagine how hard it must for a person to admit that they've been following a false prophet for years.  But I do hope that at least someone from the ahmadiyya community benefits from posts like these.

I'm also noticing common types of responces by this group.  They usually give me a fair amount of literature to go through and then when i confront them with particular lines of a book, i'm told to stop taking things out of context (even though i'm not) or stop visiting anti-ahmadiyya sites or some other unsatisfying response. Here's a response i just got a few minutes ago: 

*"Tell me why we have to go through this every single time? It's starting to get really old, you go and find out of context lines from Ahmadiyya books, then get refuted and keep coming back, trying your best to discredit a movement guided by Allah. Well, it hasn't worked thus far and will not ever work, you will see Ahmadiyyat grow, just as everyone has witnessed the growth of Ahmadiyyat over the last 100 years.*

*[Try your best to refute all the evidence presented in support of Ahmadiyyat.](http://www.alislam.org/library/books/truthfulness/index.html) It's a very short read and it contains all the evidence from the Quran and Hadith that any Muslim should need to see the truthfulness of Ahmadiyyat."*  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just going to assume this is not another ahmadiyya troll.

 There are several types of "jihad" in Islam, most of them are about self-purification.

Yes, the most important Jihad as understand by orthodox Muslims is [striving against the ego](http://muslimmatters.muslimmatters.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/nafs.pdf)

  Islam teaches "love for your homeland."

Yes, orthodox Islam teaches that we should help others, especially our neighbors. 

 Buddha, Krishna, Confucius, Zoroaster, and even maybe Socrates, and a few others are apparently probably "prophets" of Islam.

It is possible that some of them are prophets, yes.

 Evolution and natural selection are supported by Islam.

[Evolution was discussed hundreds of years ago by Muslims](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/226430?uid=3739832 uid=2 uid=4 uid=3739256 sid=21103361579393).  Not all Muslims hold onto it as a fact, however.

 "love for all hatred for none"

No, we do not love Satan and his followers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See, here's the thing about us rational people: We don't just assume things and form final conclusions about life. We keep an open mind and if we aren't sure about something, we admit that we don't know. We only accept facts when they are presented to us as such. </TEXT>

This picture is laughable. It presumes to know a definite measure of a heaven.  And the same with the Throne of Allah, which is understand to be impossible to imagine by Muslims.  But atheists will try...

Also side note: i thought the 7 Earths held a esoteric meaning and that they were layered, not upon each other.  Can a Muslim correct me if i am wrong? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  All of you anti-Ahmadiyya know that you'd lose a debate in half of a second if you tried to engage in one, which is why you rely on stupidity like "ALL 72 SECTS ARE IN AGREEMENT AHMADIYYA ARE KUFFAR LOL" or similar tactics to silence the Ahmadiyya.

I agree that some of the comments may be unconstructive, but your comment here is also rather coarse.  

If you're an open-minded person, I'd be willing to engage in a substantive debate with you. 

I mean, if anyone is afraid of losing a debate, it's probably the moderator at r/ahmadiyya that keeps removing my comments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey if this is what you honestly believe to be true, then I won't hold onto this issue.  

But what do you make out of all the tafseers, scholars and ulama of the past who did regard Muhammad (pbuh) as the last prophet? Were they all wrong? What about all the hadith that specifically mention Muhammad (pbuh) as the last prophet.

	<TEXT> From my understanding of the reading, he doesn't consider himself to be Dhul-Qarnain, but rather that he is symbolic to him.  He actually uses his story as a prophecy about himself.  

This was definitely weird to me, considering that his life was nothing like that of Dhul-Qarnain. </TEXT>
