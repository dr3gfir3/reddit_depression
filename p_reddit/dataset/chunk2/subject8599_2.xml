	<TEXT> A Jewish teenager was arrested Thursday in connection with a series of bomb threats that have rattled Jewish institutions and community centers across the US and other countries, Israeli police said.
A months-long international investigation led to the 19-year-old suspect, who used "advanced camouflage technologies" to cover his tracks, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oil prices lowest since November on higher US inventories

Oil prices are at near four-month lows after the latest figures showed US crude inventories rose faster than expected, exacerbating fears of over supply.

Brent crude is down 1.6% at $50.15 a barrel, and fell as low $50.05 earlier, the lowest since 30 November when OPEC countries agreed to cut output to ease oversupply fears.

Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed US inventories climbed by 4.5 million barrels to 533.6 million barrels last week, higher than analysts forecasts of 2.8 million. </TEXT>

She congratulated the President after his election win in a statement that also contained a defense of Western values -- amid concern in Germany that his stances on issues like immigration run counter to the principles that have sustained the Western alliance.
Germany, the most powerful political force in the European Union, has also been deeply concerned by Trump criticisms of NATO and deep skepticism inside the White House about the EU itself. </TEXT>
