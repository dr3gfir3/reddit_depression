	<TEXT> He's saying there was legal monitoring of some foreign entities.  These entities were talking to Americans, who by the rules should be 'masked', their identities kept private because they are not the target of the monitoring.

IOW Team trump was talking to people, probably Russian, who were being monitored.  Now all Nunes cares about is whether the Americans in these communications were kept anonymous.

Why is Nunes revealing this if Comey didn't?  And he's briefing the White House, which is under investigation?

	<TEXT> OK fair enough.

I have to distinguish between genre and subgenre.  There was a time when I refused to listen to country, but the original outlaws are awesome.  Johnny Cash was as much a rebel as any punk rock outfit.  He deserves appreciation.  That doesn't mean I like "modern country" like Garth Brooks and Kenny Chesney.

Pop, dance, and electronica all birth subgenres like baby kittens, and I can't like them all.  But there's definitely good pop, dance, and electronica.

Reggaeton is to Dancehall as Modern country is to Outlaw Country.  At least for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After watching the contortions of my face as I tried to figure out what to say next, he humbly explained that he had never met the president before the election. As president-elect, Trump wanted to have a conversation with Tillerson about the world given what he gleaned from the complex global issues he dealt with as CEO of Exxon Mobil.

When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned.

When Tillerson got home and told his wife, Renda St. Clair, she shook her finger in his face and said, I told you Gods not through with you.

With a half-worn smile, he said, I was supposed to retire in March, this month. I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.

That's an awesome way to pick sec of state.

	<TEXT> It's interesting that one of pot's nicknames is 'weed'.

While I don't know the etymology of that, I can tell you that one good reason to call pot weed is that it's incredibly easy to grow.  Incredibly easy.  Imagine of you could plant some beer seeds and then come get your beer 3 months later.  It's really that easy.

If people were allowed to cultivate their own pot, the whole bottom would fall out of the illicit industry you speak of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can cook marijuana.  Make a cake, cinnamon toast, etc...  Brownies are perhaps the most famous.  No bad smell and no respiratory ill effects.  Moreover, I'd say alcohol is more addictive.

I'd go a step further and say our society would be a better place if people went to a "bar" on weekends and ate some brownies than, as they do, going to bars and consuming alcohol.  There's be a lot less violence and a lot less vehicle fatalities.

The only way I think I could persuade you of this is if you tried marijuana once.

I was a child of the Reagan era and for a very long time eschewed marijuana because I thought it was some combination of more addictive and more powerful than alcohol.  After trying, it became obvious to me that I had been misinformed and led to believe things that weren't based in fact.

I'm older now and neither alcohol nor pot feature significantly in my life, but I hate that one is demonized while the other is more demonic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All due respect, but I don't find that a satisfactory explanation of what the Dems are doing right now.

I don't want to use "breathing fire" because I think the GOP is good at what that conjures in my mind.  I'd prefer the term "taking to task".

Who is taking Trump and the Republicans to task?  Two Dems come to mind: Franken and Warren.  Booker a bit, and Pelosi when she's not defending herself.  There are a handful more who I can't remember because they didn't really push enough for me to recall them.

There are hundreds of other Dems who have pretty much gathered their popcorn pails and sit watching this all unfold.

Their involvement amounts to "Meow".

The key difference here is that the GOP mercilessly attacked Obama for things very much based on opinions about how to best run the country.  They did so for years.

This is not a debate about how best to run the country.  The issue I'm speaking to here is about the president using his office for his own profit and very openly engaging in activities that could be construed as bribery by foreign nations.  Namely China.  I'm leaving the whole Russian thing out of this.

I don't buy that it's about the media not covering their opposition.  It's about their opposition being luke-warm and virtually non-existent.

And this is not a new thing.  The Dems defeat themselves if they don't speak out because they don't want to upset moderates, or think it's futile because they will be voted down.  The Dems are timid, and the fire comes from the right...or from a boutique in San Francisco...or Sanders.

Status quo died in November.  There's a very serious fight afoot about what can and cannot be accepted from a president and his administration.

McCain is agitating more than the Democrats.

The heart of this is that Democrats count on their base and play to the other side.  That's the status quo, and I'm done being a base they can count on if boutiques and people at town halls are the actual ones fighting the fight while they watch.

They have no excuse for their tepid reaction.  There's a fire lit under Trump and his cronies.  As such, they feel no heat themselves to do more than shake their heads.

Not good enough.  The Dems have a very significant chance to define themselves as the party of right against a party of wrong.

Lindsey Graham, of all people, is breaking with his own party to speak up in opposition.  Why should other GOP rank and file do so if the actual opposition party doesn't have enough guts to aggressively attempt to end the president's profiteering?

NYPD is now speaking up.  They managed to get press coverage.  Are you really suggesting that the media is ignoring congressional opposition to Trump's misconduct?  

Or are the vast majority not really saying much? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not expecting them to bring a court case.

I expect my reps to object to the president charging the US government to use his own properties, which he is not divested from.  I also expect them to object to countries like China issuing trademarks on behalf of these same businesses.

At the very bare minimum, I expect to hear loud objections that force those who don't object to appear to be offering their approval of this unacceptable state of affairs.  With the right amount of opposition, I'd expect them to "do something".  They can legislate against this behavior right now.

What really disappoints me is when there is no meaningful opposition to conflict of interest in congress, but a private business has to be the one to take the administration to task. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gettysburg was a battle on a massive scale, with skirmish lines that went on for miles.  It was very bitterly contested with very good generals on both sides fighting very strategically.

Things were not progressing, but the confederate generals identified a point that, if they managed to overrun, they could get behind and open up the whole series of union lines.  This was Cemetery Ridge.  The problem was that a line of cannons were positioned at the top of Cemetery Ridge.

Under General Pickett and a couple other generals, 10,000+ men rushed this position over a good half mile or so of open ground (actually I'm pretty sure part of it was corn field), being fired upon by the cannons the entire time.

They pulled it off, but lost half their forces in doing so and were quickly beaten back.

These were enough losses to end the Battle of Gettysburg.  And, Pickett's charge would ultimately be the last time the South went on the attack in Northern territory.

I love nature and all, but I really enjoyed visiting Gettysburg more than all the beautiful national parks I've been to.  Totally worth it for  a person with interests in American/military history.

Now, I want to go see Waterloo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not planning to hang around for a lengthy back-and-forth about all of this, but I will have a shot at explaining what I mean and where I'm coming from.

1. Theory

In a nutshell, the claim goes that government regulation is bad because it interferes with the "pure competition" of a "truly free market".  There is a strong emphasis that this "pure competition" would result in businesses regulating themselves to satisfy and win over consumers from their competition.

The truth, as history demonstrates over and over, is that pure competition results in either a) ruthless competition where companies will do anything and everything to destroy their competition and lie, cheat, and steal in order to sell their products or b) collusion where businesses stop competing and conspire with one another to fix prices and share profits at the expense of consumers.

In a nutshell, ethics are one of the first things cast aside in "pure competition" scenarios.

The above will be revisited in numerous later points.

2. History 

Smith did not actually recommend governments stay out of business completely.  Rather, he wanted business to go on with as little restriction as possible.  Later in life, Smith also became increasingly uneasy as the rich became less interested in ethics.  More specifically, he saw the rich becoming more interested in themselves than they were in driving economic forces for the overall benefit of their countries. 

3. Big government

Did government just wake up one day and say "You know what? I think we should go interfere with business and trade.  Let's regulate it."

No.  Businesses in so many areas had relatively free markets until widespread abuse and corruption forced government to act (evidence again that "pure competition" doesn't result in businesses self-regulating).  A major example of this is the robber barons and one could argue that modern regulation began with T Roosevelt's trust-busting efforts.  That said, the late 1800s are chock full of unfettered business behaving in all matter of vile ways.

So, who created "big government"?  The businessmen themselves did.

There's a strong parallel between regulations and laws.  They don't just happen.  They arise out of need.

Businesses saying they need to get rid of regulation so they can behave better on their own is like the mafia saying we need to get rid of police so that they don't have that hassle.

The free market argument goes that business ends up having to buy influence in government to avoid/control regulation, but government is the only check that average citizens have against multi-million/billion business/corporate entities.

And how about this:  if Big Business really doesn't want Big Government, they could turn their campaign donations toward creating Small Government by getting money out of politics.  I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for that to happen.

Best of all, we just got front-row seats to watch what happens when government gets deregulated.  So far, climate Science is going to get swept under a rug and coal companies get to dump waste in rivers.  Just wait and see what's up ahead.

4. Big Business

Looking back at history, what kind of business resulted in regulation because it misbehaved?  It wasn't small business owners (not that they're angels).  As business gets bigger, ethics become more of a problem.  Corporations are a convenient way for no one person to be responsible for the ethical lapses of these economic juggernauts.

We live in an era of 900-lb gorillas.  They cry about regulation but already have preposterous amounts of power nationally and internationally.

The whole free market argument is to unchain the gorillas that are already barely chained.  Why?  Because they're going to behave themselves without government interference.  Pure competition is going to mean that they have to behave ethically to win over consumers.  That's not even an argument.  That's insanity.

5.  Deregulation by sector

To make a list of common categories of regulation, three important ones are:

a) Consumer protection-limiting the ways business might lie to you or collude

b) Citizen protection- you may not even be their customer, but they may be polluting your community or something similar

c) Fair competition- large companies may try to smash small companies to eliminate competition

How might deregulation affect the following? 

i) healthcare- human health should not be a for-profit business.  In the case of "pure competition", insurance companies will do like what they've already done:  cast out the non-profitable customers via 'pre-existing condition clauses' and high premiums.  We're fighting a healthcare bill right now that reduces regulation in this area.

ii) software- Remember Netscape Navigator?  Remember Bill Gates' email about smashing the bug?

iii) construction- building things to code?  The Trump administration is in the process of getting rid of those pesky codes.  Who's going to benefit?  Will we have better buildings as "pure competition" drives these builders to regulate themselves?

iv) education- for-profit universities have generated an amazing track record in a realtively short amount of time working outside of traditional accreditation systems.  But accreditation is regulation, right?  Are they improving university ethics or destroying them?

6. tort law v tort lawyers

The response to most of 5 above is "But you're giving all of these examples of bad business occurring under government regulation."  And my response is, "So your solution to all of those problems is to get rid of regulations?"

And the answer to that comes with the next free market premise:  that instead of regulations, we will shift everything to "tort law",  meaning all of the liability and culpability gets addressed by suing one another directly for damages.

My response in a nutshell: shifting all of the executive and legislative regulation so that the judiciary exclusively deals with it through tort law will only make the problem worse.

The game changes but it doesn't go away.  The judiciary is already involved in business litigation, and how great does that work?  It's a game of who has the best lawyers and legal teams, and it's still heavily weighted in favor of those with the money to buy an advantage in the system.  All tort law all the time will just make this even more so.

7.  Conclusion and disclaimers

In saying all the above, I do not mean to say our current regulations are all good or that there are no problems.  The problem I do see is free market proponents lingering in vague generalities about Big Government and too much regulation.  The solution to over-regulation is to streamline and eliminate what may be over-regulated in the system as is, not to just dump it all and trust this notion of "pure competition" to sort it out instead. 

And I like the spirit behind free market arguments in that people are trying to think of better ways to run things.  I'm just not anywhere remotely close to subscribing, and a lot of what I see seems naive.

Anarchy and communism are also interesting ideas.  They have both been show to work on small scales, basically in groups/communities where everyone agrees not to be exploitative and truly works to make the system work.  On a large scale, they fail miserably due to corruption.  I'd put free markets in the same category.  There are cases in history where they have worked, but arguing that we should take a United States populated by mega-corporations and give them a chance to just do the right thing absent of regulation is a bad idea.  A very very bad idea.

Free market propaganda, on the other hand, is so wrong (both ethically and in terms of correctness) on so many levels that you must support it with religious levels of fervor to actually believe it will work.

Going back to a gold standard is another fairytale impossibility.

Mostly mostly, though, their positions seem very reactionary and few of them seem to be able to argue their position beyond sweeping proclamations about what generally sound like magic bullet solutions.

And I don't hate them.  I'm just very underwhelmed.  For the new party to be as underwhelming as the two big parties?  No thanks.  I'll keep looking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Governments and peoples are two completely different things.

Russians are as responsible for their leadership as I am for Trump, perhaps even less so.  Which means you have little to no say in a system that is corrupt and rigged in favor of those who can pay for representation.

Russian people, their culture, and their history are all an amazing episode in the story of humanity.  Their contributions to the arts, especially literature, cannot be downplayed.  

That's not to say it's all a happy or just story, but no story is all good or all bad.

It's unfortunate but very real that the US and Russia have had and continue to have an adversarial relationship in global politics.

Messing with our election is a very serious thing and not really something any American can accept.  But then again, it wasn't *your* idea, right?

It was your leader's choice to do so.  He's not helping with the situation at all.

But I don't hate you.  I went to Russia and found it all very interesting and memorable.  The people were nice and friendly towards me as their guest.

	<TEXT> That's interesting, because I believe we group people by color to demonstrate that racist acts are being committed against them.  We also use them to show evidence of systemic racism when, for example, these groups are paid less than their non-minority counterparts.

Yes, I am talking specifically about the US.  It seems that this term evolved in Europe to have derogatory connotations.  Sometimes words diverge geographically over time.  

In England, the words 'blasted' and 'bloody' count as swear words.  They don't in the states.  'Fanny' is a polite word for 'butt' where I grew up.  It's something far more offensive that you don't want to be saying in London.   Who's right?  No one.  It just helps to be sensitive when you're talking to others who might misconstrue what you're trying to say.

In the states, the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) is one of the most prominent voices fighting against racism and inequality.

Are they racist for grouping themselves by color?

	<TEXT> When we talk about minorities, technically we are grouping people by the color of their skin.  Is talking about minorities racist?

Again, usage and social connotation are what determines whether a word is offensive or not.

As far as I know, those who we refer to as people of color embrace the term and do not find it offensive.  In fact, the terms seems to have evolved as an umbrella term embraced by a number of various minorities.

If those that it refers to decide that they find it offensive, then it may further evolve to be unacceptable.  That change would happen through a social movement.  It doesn't happen by looking in a science book and decreeing a new linguistic rule. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, investing in social programs saves money in the long run by creating more productive members of society.  Those left to stagnate have a far higher chance of being a greater financial burden for everyone.

Just one example: Look at how many people are in prison and how much we have to pay to care for them.  Granted, some in prison are simply incorrigible.  However, many turn to a life of crime when they  lack the skills, opportunities, and money to live their lives as productive citizens.

Note well how the US has a far bigger problem with crime and incarceration compared to other countries with similar development levels who, pretty much across the board, have more functional social democratic systems.

The American fiscal conservative is far more extreme than a British Tory, as just one example. </TEXT>
