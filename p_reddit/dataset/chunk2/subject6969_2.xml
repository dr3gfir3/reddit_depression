	<TEXT> I like the new Panasonics (the UX180 is a better deal than the 90 in the long run), but I would grab up a C100 with DPAF and stick with your 24-105 until you can buy one of the holy trinity lenses (16-35/24-70/70-200). Grab an Atomos Ninja Star recorder if Prores is something you want. 

That leaves you with a large portion of your budget for a better slider (Cinevate Duzi is amazing, Edelkrone as well). Your tripod is fine, but if you want to upgrade check out the 504 head with 546 legs, or the Benro BV6 (modeled after Sachtler heads). 

Definitely upgrade your wireless lavs to Sennheiser if you have anything else (of course if you have Lectrosonics stick with those). $629 per lav kit and will last you years and years.

All of the above (including batteries/cards/bag for the camera) should run you close to $5000.00.

	<TEXT> If you're shooting film, use a higher ISO speed and you'll start to notice it. Back in the 80's it was probably 800, maybe even 400.

In digital, you could try adding it in post with effects, however I've never liked them or thought they really gave off the same feel as actual film grain </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting. Lee is a great brand, but I've never heard of this line from them. And the low price is strange. 

Also note that 100mm x 100mm is the same as 4x4. 

In any case, I've had great use out of [these](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/58704-REG/Tiffen_44ND9_4_x_4_Neutral.html) from Tiffen, and [these](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/251629-REG/Schneider_68040944_Neutral_Density_ND_0_9.html) from Schneider. There's also [these](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1067709-REG/formatt_hitech_fc100ndkit1_100_x_100mm_firecrest.html) which seem pretty decent for a bit cheaper.

	<TEXT> I'd go C100 and use the T3i as a B-cam. Similar color science, you won't have too much trouble matching colors in post. DSLRs are great, but having everything you need IN the camera is so much easier, especially when youre running around a wedding and trying not to miss shots. 

Also, the Dual Pixel Auto Focus on the C100 is AMAZING for run and gunning. Best autofocus for video I've ever used (except for the new DPAF on the C300mk2 of course)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By "tunnel effect" you're referring to the black matte around the characters? If so, it's definitely easier to do in post, but can be done in camera if you'd like!

For post: Use a fisheye lens on set, in post apply a matte/circle mask/vignette and customize to your liking. There's tutorials on Youtube on how to apply a matte/mask in post, find one for whichever editing software youre using!

For in camera: Use a fisheye lens and attach the matte physically. I did this on one short by using a square cardboard matte I had Art Department make and mounted it in front of the camera (in our case on 15mm rods). You can definitely do the same, and can experiment with spacing in between the lens and matte to get the effect you're after.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The s60 is not Steadicam branded, it's simply marketed as a "steadicam" device, and looks to come from an off brand out in East Asia somewhere. Having said that, I'd go Glidecam simply for the support and customer service. Glidecam is based in the US and is a fairly small company, so if you ever have issues you'll have no problem getting support from them. They're really good about warranties and replacement parts as well.

I can't speak for the quality of the off-brand s60, but having experienced many of these cheap Amazon knockoffs, I'd stay away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wouldnt be consistent for every person unfortunately. Nest spawns are at a rate of around 20% per spawn point at a nest. With 10 spawnpoints, you could get 10 nested pokemon per hour, 6 per hour, or even 0 per hour. It's all RNG. Now adding a spawnpoint number to each nest would be a great idea on the other hand. </TEXT>

There are longer scans like the 2x15, however what you are talking about was just an error going around for a bit. </TEXT>
