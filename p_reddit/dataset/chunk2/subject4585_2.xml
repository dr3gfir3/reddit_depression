	<TEXT> My favorite is Manipulation. I see a lot of people not liking it because togashi hasn't shown enough cool abilities with it. One thing I don't think most people think about is what all you can manipulate. People are stuck thinking you can only manipulate objects but imagine if you can manipulate air, Gravity, your aging or even space itself by switching objects with equal mass around. I think in the new continent were going to see what makes manipulation so powerful. I see it as one of the abilities with the most possibilities yet to be explored. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going on. She gave me her tumblr so i checked it out. I was scrolling through and it was filled with boys and girls with blood dripping from backs due to scratches. She even posted her nudes on there and said "I want someone to come push my into a closet and fuck me dry". These kinds of people make me fear for the morality of human kind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For some reason a lot of the One Piece fandom is obsessed with space and the moon. They say that the moon and space in general will play a huge part in the ending of one piece. Some even believe the final arc is in space. I don't understand how people got to this conclusion, I've never seen anything related to the moon or space in the manga. Please explain the thinking, I'm confused as hell </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most people overestimate ging and say he could beat meruem or underestimate him. In a one on one fight meruem would wreck him but ging is excessively powerful and could take a guardsman, that I'm sure of. Ging is the best nen user shown to the manga so far, meruem is the strongest physically so far and Netero has had the strongest nen ability so far. All of them are extremely strong in different ways. </TEXT>

But after mito won gon in court, she told ging to never come back ever. We can all agree Ging is still an asshole parent but don't get the facts misconstrued. Ging didn't just throw gon into mito, mito went out of her way to keep ging away from gon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm fairly new to magic; I just went to my first local tournament using my friends cards and got second place. The game is so much fun and I wanna be able to make my own Decks. I enjoy the quick haste attacks of red but I play well with the "underhanded" tactics of blue. I'm going to make a blue and red deck for my next tournament. Any suggestions for cards I should look out for or are a must for any blue red deck? Anything helps, thanks </TEXT>
