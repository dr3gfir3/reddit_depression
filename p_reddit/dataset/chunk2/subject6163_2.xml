	<TEXT> Havent been kidnapped, but could have been about three times the past few years. 

Was riding my bicycle home from youth and got hit by a car, got in the car with then to get a ride to the hospital. 

Funny part is I ran into him at the supernatket a few months ago, and he i troduces himself as "hey im the one that hit you with my car."

Another time i was lost trying to find my friends house, so i got a ride with a random guy bamed Chris in a orange jeep. Met him in a back alley. I made it to my friends place, and to this day havent found Chris again. My friends think i made him up. 

And finaly a few days ago i got a ride home after buying a computer from someone i net online. Thankfully i didnt get robbed or kidnapped as i had cash on me and could have easily been taken. 

I am sometimes too trusting with people i first meet it seems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very interesting story, like many others I am skeptical though. 

Why would he erase everything not knowing if you had a backup? You could have lost photos, contacts, tweaks and more. 

And did he hinself push erase all times or did you push it? If he did then thats on him, but if you happened to push it even once, then you knew what would happen. 

Either way sorry you lost your jailbreak.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started vaping again after 3 months of not using it, and now I feel sick and have been throwing up. 

I am using a tobacco flavor with 6mg nicotine, so maybe I overdid it?

Would it be worth it to try the other flavors I got that are 6, or go back and swap them for a lower nic content?

**edit** I am a dumbass, I meant 6mg not 60%. Sorry, been a long day </TEXT>
