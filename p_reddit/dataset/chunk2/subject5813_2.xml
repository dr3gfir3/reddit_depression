	<TEXT> To get a baseline bike, it would have probably been cheaper and more cost effective to get a new bike, but I didn't do it to save money. I enjoyed the look on my dad's face when he saw it more than purchasing any bike would give me. It came out to around $200, taking a swag estimate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hah, thanks for the feedback. I went into the build completely blind. I didn't want to damage the knurls, so I went with the rubber oil filter wrench. 

I inspected each bearing assembly, cleaned, and re-greased each set. The bearings were in good shape, so they didn't need to be re-packed (I've repacked on cars when they get bad, this was not the case, fortunately).

Other additional items I will be getting are a front reflector/headlight and new handlebar grips, but she's done otherwise. 

I'm looking forward to some city cruising/slow roll events! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way to keep an open mind is to consciously make an attempt to not compare anyone new to the ex. Force yourself to focus on unique characteristics of a new person that attract you to them and realize that in order to find someone you will want to get in a relationship with, it is going to take time to develop feelings for that person.

The problem with comparing anyone to an ex is they have known their ex for a long period of time. They had become a normality in your life, and change is always difficult. Treat meeting new people as more of an adventure and don't get lost in setting metrics for them; you will get much more enjoyment out of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, if you've removed her and are trying new things, just think about the old adage, "Time heals all wounds". It gets better, just keep doing your thing and you'll get there.

I've seen my friends make the mistake of putting their exes on a pedestal when they are trying to date, and that mental block is what keeps them from getting into another relationship. Do everything in your power to keep an open mind; everyone is unique. It didn't work for some reason, so don't go looking for the same things when you're getting back on the horse, so to speak. Just another friendly word of advice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Hundreds of thousands" is a pretty big exaggeration. I went to the best mechanical engineering school in America for 5 years and didn't even reach 100k in student loan debt.

Also, going to college to get a degree in an area with no realistic expectation for a job can be expected is most likely exactly what 1/3 of the people who go, do. Essentially college has turned into a social norm, so people feel obligated to go. Generally, these people go to community college, rack up 20k or so in debt, then drop out. People in the case that you're outlining is a very, very small minority.

It's about making the most out of your abilities, whether that is through trade or college. The best advice is if you don't have an idea of what you want to do, don't go until you figure it out. </TEXT>

I grew up in comfortable/rich suburbia, got a BSME at the number one rated college for mechanical engineering (Kettering University) and got a great job in the industry. I just got bored and tired of driving, so I moved downtown.
