	<TEXT> **Ingredients**

8 soft shell crabs

2-3 avocados, cut into long strips

2-3 small cucumbers, peeled and cut into matchsticks

1 package alfalfa sprouts, cut into smaller segments

8 seaweed sheets

1 egg yolk, lightly beaten

1 cup iced water

1/2 cup gluten free flour, plus more for coating

1/2 cup cornstarch

1/2 teaspoon baking powder

ice water bath, (fill larger bowl than the one that will be used for the batter with ice and some water)

oil for deep frying

gluten free tamari, wasabi (optional) and spicy mayo (optional) for serving

**Instructions**

Place ice water in large bowl. Gradually pour beaten egg yolk into the ice water, stirring with chopsticks. Add flour, cornstarch and baking powder all at once, lightly mixing with chopsticks until ingredients are loosely combined. Batter should be runny and lumpy. Place batter bowl into larger ice bath bowl to keep it cold while frying.

Heat the oil (over medium/medium-high) in a small pot to 340 degrees F for seafood. (If you don't have a thermometer, test the oil by dropping a piece of batter into the hot oil - if it sinks and immediately rises to the top the oil is hot enough). There should be enough oil so that the soft shell crab is completely submerged.
Dip soft shell crabs first in flour in batter, and drop into hot oil. Depending on how large your pot is fry 2-3 at a time 3-4 minutes per side, flipping them over in the middle. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Repeat for remaining soft shell crabs.

To make the rolls, place seaweed sheet in front of you, and on the lower 1/3 of the sheet layer avocado, cucumber, alfalfa and soft shell crab cut in half. Start rolling away from you, making sure to tightly hold everything together. Cut into six pieces with a sharp knife. Repeat for remaining ingredients.

(If you have a bamboo sushi rolling mat, cover it in plastic wrap and use that to make the rolls, placing the seaweed sheet on top, layering the ingredients and then rolling away from you, holding the roll tightly together).

Serve with gluten free tamari, wasabi and spicy mayo (mixture of mayo and Sriracha)

**Cuisine: Japanese | Recipe Type: Dinner**
