	<TEXT> The part I find interesting is that 2015 was when they had the 3-tiered taxation system - 25% at each step from grower to processor to retail - plus 10% sales tax but then 2016 they simplified that to just a 37% excise tax plus 10% if you aren't a MMJ patient. That amounted to a huge reduction in the tax rate which has contributed to the plummeting prices (all the new growers has undoubtedly done more for that) which actually lead to more than a doubling of the total tax collected. At least they figured that out eventually. And it let OR see what **not** to do. </TEXT>

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Harry_J._Anslinger#/The_campaign_against_marijuana_1930.E2.80.931937


 Anslinger had not been active in this process until approximately 1930. Prior to the end of alcohol prohibition, Anslinger had claimed that cannabis was not a problem, did not harm people, and there is no more absurd fallacy than the idea it makes people violent. His critics argue he shifted not due to objective evidence but due to the obsolescence of the Department of Prohibition he headed when alcohol prohibition ceased - seeking a new Prohibition. Of 30 leading scientists whose views he sought, 29 said cannabis did no harm. However, Anslinger chose to pursue only the views of the one who did. </TEXT>
