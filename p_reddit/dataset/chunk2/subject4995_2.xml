	<TEXT> When I was 17 I got really drunk and high with my friends and I was feeling like a tough guy. So I told my one of my friends that I could take any pain and nothing he could do would hurt me. So he asked if he could stab me and my stupid ass said yes and that's how I got a crochet needle through my arm. </TEXT>
