	<TEXT>  And in that case, Israel has not challenged the ruling.

Because Israel can't. 

Again, Israeli law doesn't apply on the palestinian territories and the palestinians make their own law.


Incidentally, for all the reports of that incident, I can't find any follow up on what happened. Can you?

What follow up do you want? Those guys are dead. What do you want? Resurrection? A zombie uprising?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, I just showed you an example where a palestinian law runs contrary to Israeli law. Or do you think that Israel is okey with the law to not sell things to Jews? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because Jerusalem is not part of palestinian territories. It was annexed to Israel. 

But the palestinian territories controlled by the PA and Hamas have their own law that is not subservient to Israel. Like selling land to Jews. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Palestinians are not subjected to Israeli law. They have their own law.

For example

Selling land or housing to Jews is punishable by death, some high-profile cases got high media coverage.[79][80][81]
