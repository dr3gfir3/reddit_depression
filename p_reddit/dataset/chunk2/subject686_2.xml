	<TEXT> thank you for good imput. I know for sure 9mm are allowed. I think they fall in to standard category of IPSC. 
I'm about to attend firearms safety course and exam, can't even get a license without that in our country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thank you, that's what i needed to know. I can get new sights for those extra 100$. Would you recommend 0,25$ trigger job for beginners? Do you modify your grip in any way? Stipple job or tape? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. Just needed to know if i would still have a chance if i go with 17. Not planning to mod it a lot. Will change sights before i even try it probably, then maybe trigger job later. Nothing fancy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello there fellow redditors! I've been lurking this sub for a while now. I'm currently in the process of getting a gun permit, and it's going to be a first piece for me. Since the process is quite long in my country, i have some time to plan ahead. 

I will choose Glock as my first gun. Thinking about 17/19 but will probably take 17. I plan on competing. I heard Glock might not be the best choice, but since i'm a total beginner, i think it won't really matter from the start.
What i would like to ask you is, which sights mod would you recommend for competition shooting? I don't want to mod the gun too much (will probably get a new trigger with 3,5lb pull once i get used to the gun, and some stippling job if needed).
Would you recommend anything else than practice, practice, eat, sleep, practice, practice?

Thank you a lot!

EDIT: forgot to ask about good holsters and belt for practical and competition shooting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will be awesome. Can't wait. That's the problem with alot of people today. Everything offends them. But being offensive is very important. And we should never stop that.

I love these two pieces on the subject:

	<TEXT> It actually has different names in some countries. Overall name is Floorball, in Sweden they call it Innebandy, in Finnland its Salibandy.

Its very fast-paced and you must be agile as hell to play it. I love it. I've been playing it for almost 10 years now. 

Wikipedia has quite long article about it, also check youtube for instructional videos. If you want to see more action, try searching for world championship finals. It's always Sweden and Finnland (because those guys are gods when it comes to this sport).
