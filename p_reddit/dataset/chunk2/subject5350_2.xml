	<TEXT> I tell the kids, if she bites you it's on you. We tell them not to bother her. If someone was screaming and running around like wild animals I'd be on edge to. I think she's losing her hearing also because she's very jumpy even when I touch her. We'll make sure she lives out a happy life. She was cage trained but I can't stand a dog in a cage all night so she sleeps with us. Her favorite times of the day are her morning potties with treat after and going to bed at night. She's a good dog, just not a child friendly one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not rough, but screaming and running around an older dog can put her on edge. Our kids are wild. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My kids just want a dog they can play with, she is old and just not into that. She'd rather just lay with you and be petted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My kids tried that with our dog, within 6 in. of her bubble her teeth would show. Every inch they got closer her mouth would open more. What a bitch.

Our kids are little, and she hates kids. Why get a dog that hates kids when you have kids? Well we took care of her after a family member was contemplating on putting her in a shelter because she didn't get a long with her kids. To be fair, Mrs. Mimi was raised with cats, so the cats are to blame .  After we took Mrs. Mimi we started having kids of our own. Now we are a loving family with personal bubbles. </TEXT>
