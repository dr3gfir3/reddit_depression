	<TEXT> DICE makes good games. Just look at Battlefield 3 and the Frostbite 2 engine. Amazing stuff. How about Mirror's Edge. Still an awesome game. By buying BF3 I feel like I am giving a thumbs up to DICE and hoping for a Mirror's Edge 2 in the future.

People hate EA for multiple good reasons. How do I as a consumer show my support for DICE while trying to get EA to change. Do I not buy anything and risk DICE getting shutdown (probably won't happen) or buy the game and support EA as a side effect? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> better stress and bug test - plus leaving a better impression.

Maybe I did not make it clear that they were doing a true beta test by stressing the servers. It really doesn't matter which version of the game you use if you are stress testing your servers. Also they probably don't care as much about pleasing people during a beta when they want to please during launch. Don't just take my word for it. You can see it on the blog.

[Just by joining, you will help us stress test servers, allow us to run important tests on the games back-end, and find potential issues to track.](http://blogs.battlefield.com/2011/09/welcome_to_the_early_access_of_the_battlefield_3_open_beta/)

and 

[Just like normal procedure when releasing a game, the Open Beta has had long lead times due to testing, certification, and setting up. This means that the code you are now playing is actually quite early and not representative of the final game.](http://blogs.battlefield.com/2011/10/battlefield-3-open-beta-update-2/)

same link

[The biggest reason for running the Open Beta is to stress test our servers and back end. Already, we are seeing 6 times the number of simultaneous players in the Battlefield 3 Open Beta compared to the Beta for Battlefield: Bad Company 2! The fact that Battlefield 3 is clearly our biggest game launch ever by a magnitude of 6 makes it doubly important to test everything.](http://blogs.battlefield.com/2011/10/battlefield-3-open-beta-update-2/)

They say that it isn't about wowing people. It's about testing the game so they can release something good when it actually comes out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have heard stories about how people are really doubtful about this game and how they cancelled their pre-orders because of the beta but did anybody pre-order the game because of beta?

I really wasn't going to buy the game at first but after playing the beta I really saw how amazing of a game this was. I also knew even with all the bugs that DICE was working hard to get an amazing game out for launch. I decided to pre-order the game because I feel like the game will be awesome at launch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure there were a couple reasons for releasing a old version and keeping a new version.

1. They wanted to keep the beta the same for all platforms. The console versions need to go through validation so the console that takes the longest to validate for beta is the version that gets used for the beta (read that somewhere).

2. They wanted to update the new code with out messing with the old code. It also draws from point 1. If they released and old version of the beta they started working on it after it got launched. They didn't wait around for the bugs to come in. They got shit done. If they tried to release a newer version then they would have to wait for validation.

Basically it's the consoles that slow down the release cycle for beta. If they didn't have to worry about console validation and could release as quickly as possible they could have done weekly or nightly releases for the beta, uploading them and us downloading them to test. But they couldn't, the console validation got in their way.

TL:DR Console validation made it not possible to have a "good" version of beta to test. They could just update PC all the time but they didn't want to. I can see why. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really annoying to see people hating on something when they don't understand its real purpose. I loved beta, I actually reported some issues back to DICE (on the forums and stuff). I even pre-ordered the game because of beta. I really trust DICE on making the game the best that it can be for launch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure DICE would rather turn people away with a shit beta and release a glorious game than release a "good" beta and focus too much on pleasing people then instead of making launch as good as it can be.

This is a true beta. It isn't gold yet. Has any true beta been perfect. It takes time for something to become truly amazing and by testing the game in beta DICE can really know what is wrong with the game. They even said what they have fixed since beta has come out and even said there might be a day 1 patch with stuff fixed in beta.

then they shouldn't have released that version of the beta

The reason they did release this version of the beta was to fix the real code for launch. They can't work on both, they have to think about releasing it for testing and validation so it can hit shelves on time.

	<TEXT> Crash7800 is an awesome guy. He used to be the community manager for InstantAction (it got shut down last year). Did like weekly podcats (yes podcats) and was always talking to the community. The BF3 community is much larger than the IA community but Crash knows what he's doing. I think he understand how frustrated and angry the community can get and is really good at diffusing that anger and helping the community understand what is happening.

TL:DR Crash7800 is awesome and he's heading to DICE headquarters soon and probably will try his best to get our frustrations across to the developers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Amazon also says they don't [price match](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_T1_1-1?ie=UTF8 nodeId=468502 qid=1309223971 sr=1-1). :(

With the exception of TVs, Amazon.com doesn't price-match with other retailers (including those who sell their items on our website). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys usually act differently around guys than girls. A straight guy would usually be thinking that there is a 0% change I am going to be attracted to this guy (sexually) so they don't really have to worry about acting physically awkward around them if they are friends/bros.

For example I (straight) could put my arm around one of my friends (straight) and it would just be funny cause we would never be attracted to each other. I might not to the same to a friend who is a girl because it might be awkward or weird even though it probably wont be.

The reason why they do it around you even though they know you are gay is that its probably subconscious. They act that way around all guy friends no matter the attraction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was looking at these plans...what the shit?
I have a family plan with 4 Verizon services (Home phone, mobile phone, tv, and internet). Its about $100 for all these and 25/20 Mbps internet.

If you are generous with the High Speed Internet Enhanced Plan at 15 Mbps at $40 and look at the FiOS Faster Plan for 25/25 (really 25/20) at $70 the FiOS plan is probably a better deal (and its faster too).

Also I saw this disclaimer under the High Speed Internet Enhanced Plan: Actual speed will be provisioned at the highest optimized speed range at your location. I checked to see if Verizon internet is available out there in Westerly: used 32 Whipple Avenue Westerly 02891 and high speed internet nor FiOS is available there! Check here to see if Internet is available at your house!
