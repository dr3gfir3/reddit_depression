	<TEXT> John McCain was one of the last presidential candidates to give voice to this fundamental truth: No matter how we vote, or what Party's ticket we run on, we are all American. Regardless of your own personal political beliefs, I say without very little uncertainty that this was one of the best and one of the most courageous campaign moments this country has ***ever*** experienced.

Sometimes, we disagree on where our country needs to go, but we should never forget what John McCain once reminded us: When we get there, we get there ***together***. We are the **United** States Of America.

So, please - no matter who your friend, your neighbor, or your family votes for [even if they vote for Trump], ***do not see them as "the enemy"***. 

See them as McCain saw Obama in 2008: **As a decent American**

 "So, let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal."

	<TEXT> And what makes Lee and Paul so popular with ***both*** the GOP establishment ***and*** the Tea Party, is, like Ryan, they stick around even for policy fights they used to criticize as rigged. hey know that, rigged or not, it's the system you have to work with if you want to change it from the inside. They know you can't play checkers on one board as the GOP establishment plays chess on another board. It's not enough to say that the game is rigged and insist on forfeiting the game completely. You play it to learn how to beat it. And politics is a process. It takes a little while. But yet, Ryan, Lee, and Paul aren't going anywhere, and neither are they trying to tear down their Party. They are playing for keeps - they are playing the long game. And they know that they need to keep the GOP alive long enough to take it over.

They need the GOP as much as the GOP needs them. Just like we need to realize that we need to be able to take over the Democratic Party from the inside. And that won't happen is we abandon Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party. Paul Ryan, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul could have tried to abandon the GOP and take over a 3rd party that they were more ideologically-aligned with [like the U.S. Constitution Party]. But like the Green Party and the Libertarian Party, that third party doesn't have anywhere near the power or influence of either of the two main parties. So they decided to work within one of the two central parties.

Noticed that ***none*** of the Tea Partiers who swept Congress in 2010 ran on or defected to a third party, non-GOP ticket. They see the GOP as the host, and they are slowly but very effectively infecting their host.

We should take notes and take over the Democratic Party the same way. And that continues by helping Bernie hold a President Hillary Clinton to the promises we put into the party platform. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an example of why a complete and absolute repudiation of Trump and his brand of politics is necessary on Election Day.


We need to "bury" Trump at the polls on November 8th, not only to preserve the legitimacy of American conservatism, but for American liberalism, for American politics, for the American election system, and for the American experiment itself.


No matter what side of the American political spectrum we identify with, this election puts America and its form of government and our way of life on the ballot. I think I can say without controversy here that we were never meant to become a sectarian, xenophobic police state. Even if there are some of us here who would rather minority groups ***assimilate*** into America's traditional way of life, I hope we can all agree that the American experiment was never, ever supposed to be about substituting ***assimilation*** of minority cultures for ***persecution*** of minority cultures. 


Certainly, our country's Founders knew without any uncertainty that our political experiment was necessary ***in order to*** divorce the primitive, sectarian brutality of ***persecution*** from a more "enlightened" gradual and even incremental project of ***assimilation*** through compassionate civic dialogue. This is what the "American melting pot" has always been about: Everyone was welcome in our way of life and to add to our way of life, but in their own time. Our Founders ***knew*** the difference between **evolution** and **revolution**, and saw in their own experience that persecution ***always*** leads to disaffection and revolution, whereas respect for diversity will always lead us on the path of **evolution**.


Trump does not understand this about our American story, nor does he **accept** it. His is a [demonstrably nihilistic worldview where it is the natural order that the strong survive by eating the weak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yh0jAxOxGE). Survival is no longer by honest hard work or effort or civic life, but it is by ***chance***. Either you kill, or you ***are*** killed. In this view, only the "ruthless killers" are worthy of American citizenship - only the ruthless sharks who can kill off his competitors to get to the top of the pack. What this boils down to is a ***cultural eugenics*** - a perverted form of ***Social Darwinism***.- either you find your place ***immediately*** or you're out. No time for you to get on your feet. No patience for circumstance. No empathy or sympathy for the least of thee. If you break a sweat - well, there's no time for that; Trump's America will leave you behind. It doesn't matter if you ***aspire*** to live as a proud American - in the [inverted logic of Trump's cultural eugenics](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/opinion/sunday/the-next-genocide.html), you either "have what it takes," or you don't. Worse still, in this worldview, diversity is seen as ***weakness***. Only the strong survive, and in Trump's dystopia, that means we all lose if America is still a diverse country. 


In Trump's worldview, all of life is competition, and diversity just means a stronger culture has yet to kill off a weaker one. This is not patriotism, nor is it any form of nationalism. It is [***cultural, ethnic, and racial anarchism***](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/hitler-holocaust-antisemitism-timothy-snyder/404260/).


And that brings us back to why Putin is paying trolls to sow discord in our election system, and is trying to radicalize hate and resentment in our society - he wants the world to see that America is just as prone to be taken over by monsters as any other society. Putin knows that his dictatorship does not have anywhere near the unanimous support of his own people - he knows that even if they vote for him, its because of the fear and uncertainty of the unknown. And this is why he supports Trump - if a democracy can be goaded into voting based on xenophobic lies and sectarian paranoia, and if fear and scarcity drives us instead of civic empathy, Putin wins. Putin wins on the domestic front, consolidating his support in the face of increasing peaceful dissent, and he wins on the world stage. If he succeeds in installing Trump as our President, he can show the whole world that democracy is merely a mask for anarchy and chaos. And thus, Trump wil be his message to the world: This is what democracy brings you: ***Fear, violence, chaos, anarchy, and hate.*** 


This is why defeating Trump is not only a Democrat issue, a Republican issue, a Libertarian issue, a Green Party issue, a Constitution Party issue - it is an ***American issue***. And Im not saying its enough to ***beat*** Trump. We have to ***bury*** him. We have to show the world, and those among us who have let ourselves be brainwashed by him, that part of American pride is that we do not tolerate his politics of hate or his politics of fear. We do not accept that America is a hunting ground where the wolves hunt for the lambs, nor can we accept America being made into a [WWE wrestling match in which the strongest narcissist survives by humiliating the weak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypOwLUMUHw0). 


This election is a transpartisan, American election. Hate and fear and prejudice have always been with us. But the point of democracy, ***particularly our democracy***, is to show the world [***and ourselves***] that elections can bring policies that give us the civic space needed to help ***solve*** those fears and those prejudices. Trump sees fear and prejudice as a motivating force - and his answer is that we win when we kill and destroy all that we fear and all that we hate.


Trump doesnt want us to see ourselves as ***Americans***. If we see ourselves as Americans, committed to living in and building a country together, Trump loses. Contrary to Trumps surrogates in the media, most Democrats dont ***hate*** Republicans, most Republicans dont ***fear*** Democrats, Northerners dont ***look down on and vilify*** Southerners, etc. But Trump ***needs*** us to believe this if he is to win. He ***needs*** us to see the world just like he does - a world where anarchy and ruthless competition and chaos is the natural state of things, where a more gradual democratic evolutionism is replaced by a dystopic hybrid between cultural anarchy and [political authoritarianism, where even a lifelong patriot and veterans integrity is questioned because his captivity signals weakness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YU9djt_CQM). Trump wins if more American voters than not allow themselves to believe that honest political disagreement or even peaceful, nonviolent dissent equals a violent betrayal that cannot be solved through the evolutionary project of civic life or public dialogue, or even the dignity of guaranteed citizenship. Trump wins if we allow ourselves to adopt a regressive, immature view of disagreement - if you dont agree with me, youre ***a traitor*** and you are not ***an American***. Thats why birthright citizenship is so important - an American child who grows up here and lives here should feel safe enough to tell her or his government or politicians what they do or do not agree with, without any fear that their citizenship will be stripped from them for speaking up or exercising their conscience. 


Ever since our Founding, this has been our Democratic experiment, It was not always perfect, but it always ***aspired to be***. And thats the difference between how our Founders saw this countrys potential and how Trump sees this country - unlike our politics of ***aspiration***, his is a politics - and a ***culture*** - of fear and of scarcity. In his small mind, diversity and disagreement cannot ever exist ***because we lose our chance to eat***. Were all just basically hunter-gatherers back in anarchic times without nations. Were either the hunters or the hunted.


And if Trump wins, this ideology of depravity and this anarchic fear of scarcity replaces the role of public reason and patient and compassionate dialogue as the driving force of our politics. ***And our American democratic experiment dies***. A country cannot stand on persecution. A country cannot stand, nor survive, by characterizing diversity or disagreement as weakness or ***betrayal***. In America, we embrace diversity. We embrace it because were strong enough to do so without upending our own way of life. Were strong enough to learn from one another and to move the country forward by forming new consensus through dialogue and respectful debate. 


Trump does not understand this, and by all appearances, he ***does not want to understand this*** and even ***rejects what little of it he does understand***. This is why, as a free, strong, and open society, we ***must reject him***. But we must reject him as ***Americans*** - not Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Socialists, Greens, etc. **As Americans.**


And come November 9th and the days and weeks and months and years after election day, the test of our success will be how long we can stay together as **Americans**,  and continue being a culture of strength through diversity.

As to my political identity, I am Never Trump, and my posting history confirms that. I take my opposition to him seriously enough to spread that message to as many subreddits as possible. Even to ones I don't necessarily agree with. Because that's how you build the NeverTrump movement and make sure it survives post-election. 

Conservative and right-of-center Never Trump supporters - like it or not - will need the help of a certain number of Democrats and other left-of-center officials/politicians to make sure Trump or his crazy nuts do not hijack the GOP again.

And yes, the Democrats would want to help the right-of-center Never Trump people since Hillary would need the sane elements in the GOP to be willing to negotiate and govern with her.  </TEXT>

I know many here are anti-Clinton and not necessarily honest supporters of WikiLeaks and I do acknowledge that much of the recent leaks had to do with her, but I also strongly believe that this subreddit is devolving into a very passive bastardization of what WikiLeaks themselves originally to achieve - which is global transparency.

But what I've found is that most people a likelier to click on videos. For some reason, many people seem to think that videos require less time investment.

**EDIT** This seems particularly true with younger people. According to a lot of media consumption studies, younger people tend to prefer video due to the same tendency to believe videos take less time [and less concentration].

Maybe I am over-reading these reports, or perhaps I am too pessimistic towards my generation's literary habits.

	<TEXT>  She has declared that she disagrees with the Heller decision and thinks the Supreme Courts has "gone in the wrong direction" on gun control

Clinton has stated that her main concern with the Heller decision was the safety of toddlers, which was [in fact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-supreme-court-gun-decision-de/) the initial [guiding concern of the original petitioners](http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/DC_Final_Petition.pdf). Meanwhile, Clinton has always said [she respects the 2nd amendment and the rights](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/05/trump-distorts-clintons-gun-stance/) it confers to responsible gun owners, and Johnson essentially holds the same position ([particularly on trying to prevent suspected terrorists and the mentally-ill from owning guns](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Gary_Johnson_Gun_Control.htm))

 Hillary "...anti-gay marriage..." Clinton

She is not "anti-gay marriage" anymore. Look it up. [In April of 2000, as NY Senator, she was in support of civil unions, in July of 2004, she opposed a Constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and in October of 2005, she said that deferred to states on the matter of same-sex marriage. She is ***definitely not*** against gay marriage](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/).

Again, I am very disheartened that libertarians would allow themselves to become crazed right-wing conspiracy theorists. It's really, ***really*** depressing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Same for Clinton, and shes the one with a neocon foreign policy

This is a very simplistic view of political dynamics. Ideologically, Trump is a neocon, and he has said neocon things [mostly ending in "... and we'll bomb the shit out of them."]

Clinton, on the other hand, will be faced with a Congress that is ***less*** hawkish than she is. Even if the majority leadership will probably be full of Democrats, the majority will be at the mercy of the anti-interventionist Sanders-Warren wing of their party. 

If Trump gets in, he'll have no such opposition if Ryan survives or he doesn't. Steve Bannon and his Breitbart allies behind Trump will force their right-wing ethnic and economic populism through a fractured Congress [if Congressional Republicans are divided between Trump's allies and enemies].

 What planet are you on? Hillary said entitlements will be solved by increasing benfifits and taxing the rich

Trump's plan involves [raising taxes on the middle-class](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan), including [7.8 million middle-class families](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2842802). As libertarians, we're supposed to be against raising taxes on ***anyone***

Trump's plan will balloon the debt by [5.3 trillion](http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update), while Clinton's would only increase it by $200 billion. Do you mean to say that growing the debt by ***5.3 trillion dollars*** is ***more*** libertarian than growing that debt by ***$200 billion?***.

If you believe that growing the debt by 5.3 trillion is ***less*** libertarian than growing it by $200 billion, you might need to do a few re-calculations. And probably know how numbers work.

Both candidates' tax plans are very important to understand in terms of how they handle entitlements. Trump may cut entitlements, but he's doing so under a very misinformed understanding of reducing the debt. On the other hand, Clinton's entitlement and tax policies show an understanding of how to balance liberal and libertarian priorities 

Again, she may be temperamentally hawkish and pro-government intervention, but her incentives to be bipartisan will outweigh her personal inclinations. At most, her Administration and policy agenda would turn out to be left-libertarian. Why? Because her hawkish tendencies would be dampened by ***both*** Paul Ryan and his right-libertarian Congressional allies ***and*** the Sanders-Warren "progressive populist" wing.

 She also says we can't talk about the Fed Tump at least mentions the Fed.

***Nowhere*** has she said "we can't talk about the Fed". Again, setting up straw man arguments do not help our cause. Leave that to the Alex Jones-Fox News salivating circle-jerk. And Trump says whatever he thinks can get him elected. Do you think he actually ***gives a shit*** about libertarianism or non-intervention? ***He believes in an [over-militarized](http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/23/trump-wants-police-to-keep-getting-milit), [white nationalist](http://rare.us/story/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-are-polar-opposites-and-so-are-ron-paul-and-donald-trump/) police state***. He has even [called for the abolition of legal counsel for suspects](http://reason.com/blog/2016/09/20/donald-trump-vs-the-sixth-amendment) - a right guaranteed by the sixth amendment.

So, do you honestly think that a Trump presidency would be ***more libertarian*** than a Clinton presidency would? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I simply disagree with your assessment.

1) From a ***completely objective, nonpartisan perspective*** you have to acknowledge that Clinton ***never "openly declared" that she wants to "neuter"*** the 2nd amendment. That is a straw man that will do ***absolutely no good*** for the libertarian cause. 

Libertarians at least ***used to be*** known as the most rational, least emotional, most objective and most logical on the American political spectrum. We don't need conspiracy theories to support our ideology - leave that to the anti-Clinton Republicans, or to the Regressive Left.

I disagree he will get nothing done. If Paul Ryan keeps his job, he has promised to railroad ***all of his socially conservative*** agenda down Trump's throat. In fact, if Trump's opponents ***lose*** Congressional majorities, that would be ***even worse*** for libertarians, since Trump ***is definitely*** more at the mercy of right-wing pro-government intervention populism than Ryan ever will be. And as we get closer to the election, Trump looks like he will survive longer than Ryan and the non-interventionist right-wing populists of the GOP.

So, in any scenario in which Trump wins, we ***do get anti-libertarian policies*** - it's only a matter of gradation. 

If Trump gets in and has allies that outnumber his enemies in Congress, he can push his anti-libertarian social agenda through ***and get his SC Justices appointed***. On the other hand, if Ryan and the rest of ***his*** allies survive, we'll only be see a ***slightly less*** anti-libertarian agenda than if Trump gets in.

Clinton, meanwhile, has exhibited ***both*** a libertarian-leaning understanding of the importance of fiscal responsibility, balancing the budget, and of non-government intervention in social lives (***she is socially liberal and more fiscally conservative than Trump***). In other words, she is closer to a ***classical liberal*** than Trump ever was or can be, and classical liberalism is ***closer*** to contemporary libertarian philosophy than right-wing, ethnic, economic populism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see things differently. I don't see this as a betrayal, even if he *does* imply that Clinton is the "lesser evil".

Here, I think it is ***very*** important to point out that third parties have generally been successful in parliamentary democracies, where third parties are likelier to form very strong ad powerful coalitions with other parties (***even parties they opposed previously***).

So, I don't think that paragraph indicates that Weld now believes  that third parties are unimportant - I just think he believes that the Libertarian Party's policies are more likely to be accepted in a coalition with Clinton rather than Trump.

At least, this is what I think is Weld's thought process behind his statement. 

It's easier to look at his reasoning if we assume a parliamentary, coalitional framework rather than a more zero-sum presidential contest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm wondering why you're talking about "our support" when, judging by your posts, you seem to be an adamant Clinton supporter.
 
^^^^^
Our nominee is Clinton now. Bernie ran as a Democrat, and is calling on us to support her. He ***chose***  not to run for President as an Independent, because he knew he could get more things accomplished if he ran ***as a Democrat***. And getting 80% of his policies in the party platform is proof of that. I noticed that you seemed to not have bothered reading the history of politicians adhering to the party platform. Revolutions depend on fact. I suggest you try it sometime.

And with [a simple statistical analysis](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/upshot/the-senate-votes-that-divided-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders.html?_r=0), Clinton and Bernie are ***much*** [closer ideologically than Bernie is with Trump](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/). So, ***there is*** a ***significantly*** higher probability that Bernie helps lead our revolution with Hillary as President. [That's just a fact](http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/9/15/12923528/liberal-economics-great-recession-policy-clinton). And it has [***always been*** a fact](http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/hillary-clinton-policy-agenda/).

General election are part of our political tradition. And ensuring that a  Democratic President has a congressional majority is ***the*** only way we can shape our country's future. </TEXT>

For examples of this, just look at the violence and vitriol Trump has inspired against entire communities of color, the LGBTQ+ community, women, Muslims, immigrants, and essentially non-white, non-conservative, "non-traditional" Americans.

Revolution is about feeling the indignities of other communities and acting on it. Resentment is a childish, narrower version of that. </TEXT>

If our support for Bernie was genuine, we should want him to be put into a position where he can be the most effective he can be, and where he can finally implement the 80% of his policies he was able to cram in the Democratic platform. And fight for more than 80% too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, give me your definition of "shill". Too often, people on Reddit seem to thin "shill" includes ***anyone*** they disagree with. **Spoiler**: [That's not the definition](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shill). 

Yes, show me your code. And more than that, explain to me how you wrote it. I doubt that you actually wrote any such thing, or if you did, it is pretty stupid "code".

Most of my posts are articles, and much less are personal comments. So I doubt that your "code" is an accurate portrayal of my political identity.

Your use of "code" sounds more sophisticated than what you really seem to be saying here: **"I'm too lazy to actually figure out your political opinions and why they diverge from my own, so I'll just use this neat word 'code' and call you shill."** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article's text is below:

 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio solicits the opinions of many confidants before making decisions. Then he often disregards their counsel, forging ahead in ways that his inner circle sometimes describes as politically imprudent.

 This year, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has sought to curtail the horse-carriage industry, escalated a fight with one of the citys most prominent newspapers and declined to release his emails with five longtime advisers who work outside of governmentall positions that many in his inner circle oppose.

 If hes convinced hes making the right decision, he wont back down, said Karen Hinton, a former press secretary to Mr. de Blasio who left the administration in June. Depending on your perspective, its his best or worst quality.

 According to people close to him, Mr. de Blasio, 55 years old, often bristles when aides disagree with him, and some of them said they have never worked for a more stubborn person. Mr. de Blasio has told those close to him that they are giving him conventional wisdom or listening too much to his critics, these people said, and should instead focus on the mission, or what he calls his administrations work.

 Eric Phillips, who succeeded Ms. Hinton as press secretary, said Mr. de Blasio has a clear-eyed vision to improve the city.

 He wont compromise that mission by conforming to some outdated or past mayors concept of the job, Mr. Phillips said.

 Earlier this month, Mr. de Blasio called the New York Post a right-wing rag and a negative presence in our city and declined to answer questions from the news outlet. Some of his advisers have winced at the fight, saying they dont believe Mr. de Blasio benefits from attacking the newspaper.

 The mayor has told allies that print media is fading, social media is rising and that people will agree with his criticisms of the Post. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Post referred to the newspapers front page earlier this month depicting the mayor as a baby crying in a high chair. The Post and The Wall Street Journal are both owned by News Corp.

 In September, two media outlets sued the mayor over his administrations decision not to release emails between Mr. de Blasio and five advisers.

 People close to Mr. de Blasio have recommended releasing the emails, but the mayor has doubled down, with aides and lawyers huddling at Gracie Mansion earlier this month to discuss fighting the lawsuit.

 The mayors trip last winter to Iowa to campaign for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, even though he wasnt invited by Mrs. Clintons campaign, was widely opposed by his advisers. Many of the mayors allies disagreed with Mr. de Blasios 2015 decision to delay his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton for six months.

 Mr. de Blasio told his allies he wanted to push Mrs. Clinton to the left and he coveted a bigger voice on the national stage. He said this month he had no regrets, even as leaked emails from Mrs. Clintons campaign showed some of her aides were frustrated by the mayors actions.

 This year, the mayors aides mocked Mr. de Blasios proposed limits on horse carriages, according to emails reviewed by the Journal. Even after the proposal fell through, Mr. de Blasio told aides he wanted to try to revive it, drawing resistance from some of his staff.

 On many mornings, Mr. de Blasio travels from Gracie Mansion on Manhattans Upper East Side to a gym in Brooklyn, a 12-mile midmorning trip that has attracted protests and has become the subject of jokes around City Hall among people close to the mayor. Mr. de Blasio has said he has no plans to change his gym routine.

 Those close to Mr. de Blasio said the mayors governing approach is deeply rooted in his experience working for former Mayor David Dinkins in the 1990s and his own come-from-behind victory in the 2013 mayoral race.

 Mr. de Blasio believes Mr. Dinkins was unfairly attacked as a liberal Democrat. In 2013, as a candidate for mayor, Mr. de Blasio shunned all sorts of advice as he floundered early on in the polls during the primary.

 Bill Hyers, Mr. de Blasios 2013 campaign manager, said many people urged Mr. de Blasio to change course during the primary. But Mr. de Blasio stuck to his guns, stayed disciplined on the change and inequality message and ultimately won, Mr. Hyers said.

 To the dismay of some close to him, the mayor has said he isnt interested in attending events his predecessors have traditionally gone tosuch as parties in Manhattanif he doesnt believe they jibe with his ideological mission or if he disagrees with their corporate sponsors.

 Whether you like the mayors politics or not, said Mr. Phillips, the mayors spokesman, we think New Yorkers respect that hes not trying to be anything other than himself.

	<TEXT> Most of the comments I *do* get is of "you're a shill!" variety, so I generally don't respond to most comments. Comments that contain questions, or just straight, clear-cut questions are a different story. I tend to find *those* interesting enough to respond to. 

And for the record, I think the term ***"pandering"*** is being overused ***way too much*** in this election. Seems to me "pandering" is being used as short-hand for "You're saying something I don't agree with, but in a way that might seem reasonable to others here. I don't like that, so you must be getting paid and/or are motivated by profit."

So for me, when these assertions do come up - and when I don't think the poster is open to reasonable dialogue - I don't bother all that often.

When I was new to Reddit, I made the mistake of being too responsive, which too often meant getting stuck arguing with trolls or earnestly paranoid redittors who weren't interested in changing any of their opinions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ... Is any of that supposed to evoke any type of thoughtful response from me?

Anyway, as you can probably see from my history, I do respond to comments fairly rarely, but that's either because most of the response I get are all along the lines of ***1)*** "You're a paid shill!", or ***2)*** "I agree with absolutely everything you say." Generally speaking, I don't respond to either of these two extremes. What I *do* respond to is something along the lines of "Well, I don't agree with this, but am curious why you believe this," or "Hey, that something new I didn't think of/I heard elsewhere. Tell me more.".

Simpy accusing others of holding opposing viewpoints because they are **paid to** is a very cheap ploy to shut down debate. And it no way encourages conversation.

Now, I don't know anything about you, but you seem to think I'm a Hillary shill. However, a combination of demographic probabilities and your username indicates to me that I'm probably to "the left" of you on more issues than you realize on the traditional American political spectrum. But then again, you also probably don't care about any of that since you already quite obviously made up an opinion of who I am based on a very filtered examination of my posting history.

One more point before I go: You seem to think that I'm involved with a coordinated plot to ban you. I don't know if there is or not, but I am not an involved participant of it. </TEXT>

I can't speak for the other person you mentioned in your comment, but I see very little point in engaging anyone in conversation who is totally unwilling to entertain opposing viewpoints and utterly incurious about the world beyond their filter bubble.

To me, that's not really a conversation worth more than a hopefully inspiring and evocative post. 

***EDIT***: FYI, if you are earnestly curious about why someone holds a different viewpoint to your own, perhaps you should try ***not*** starting the conversation calling them "shill," or implying that they are faithless bots. Just a thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While we both agree that Hillary is a much superior candidate to Trump - and I absolutely despise that con man - I think is is deeply important to separate our feelings towards him and Trump supporters. There is a subset of them who do not agree with his moral or ethical views, but see him as someone who can make the economic policymakers in Washington finally care about them and their concerns.

I do not think we should write this subset off, and I think there is a very real opportunity to reach them. But it is very, very important to not condescend to them - and more importantly, it is very necessary that we don't fit their image of detached elitists who look down on them and dismiss their way of life as backwards. That is definitely not how to start a conversation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You owe it to your fellow citizens who are most ideologically aligned with you to amplify their votes

The keyword above is ***amplify*** and if you agree that Stein would replicate her past electoral successes, there's very little possibility that you ensure the outcome that your friends' votes would be ***amplified*** in any meaningful or consequential way by refusing to vote for Clinton.

 Again you're back at it with this notion that voting for one candidate is actually voting for another.

Yes, because this is the outcome of any general election in this country.

  I would vote in favor of the policies I actually want, instead. If everyone did that, the two deeply unfavorable parties would lose every election.

If you agree that Trump is beating Clinton in the polls, that means the majority would prefer her over Trump. And no, it is not true that both are hated in equal numbers. If that were true, and if you simultaneously want to insist that Jill Stein still can win, we should be able to see shifts in support between Clinton and Stein such that they flip their electoral positions, or at the very least, she and Trump would flip electoral positions, which they are not. 

In other words, if we stick to ***realistic*** probabilistic calculations, even if we both agree that Stein would be able to switch electoral positions with Trump [which she has not so far], you'd have to agree that Clinton would ***still be doing better than Stein is***.

And this brings us to exactly where we are in chronological order:

1) Clinton
2) Trump
3) Johnson
4) Stein

If you insist that Stein is more popular the Clinton, Stein would have to move from position 4, pass Johnson, pass Trump, and then at least move within striking distance of Clinton. In other words, Stein would have to garner enough votes away from ***both** Trump ***and*** Johnson to even come ***close*** to Clinton's electoral position. 

And you cannot conclude that she's more popular than Clinton if she's losing to ***both*** Trump ***and*** Johnson. You cannot say that an electoral distance between number 1 and number 4 has nothing to do with policy preference. 

In other words, if you would agree that at least some of the difference between the electoral positions between Trump and Clinton have to do with policy preferences, it is likely that if you would agree that Trump is farther away from you on the political spectrum than Clinton is, it would be ***necessarily*** true that you would ***rather*** Clinton become President than Trump.

If you prefer ***Johnson*** to Clinton, that does not change the electoral positions, because Johnson would still be one electoral position ***above*** Stein, which is deceptive since we're not counting the large ***vote share*** Johnson is leading Stein with. So voting for Johnson still does not switch Johnson's electoral position with Clinton's, let alone invert their voting shares.

So, to go back to an argument based on the candidates' ***actual positions*** and assuming you're not so brazen as to write off the feelings of an entire sub-constituency, Clinton would still be beating Trump, and that ***necessitates*** her winning greater voter share than Stein. In [***no** current polls](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html#polls) is Stein beating Trump **or** Johnson. At the very least, if you were correct in your implication that Trump and Clinton are hated ***equally***, Stein should at least have ***more*** of a vote share to Johnson's and thus threaten the vote share of Trump's. But Stein is not doing that.

Like it or not, only one person can be President, and this means Stein would have to take ***both*** voting shares of Trump's ***and*** Johnson's to have a shot at beating out Clinton for the Presidency. 

Argue all you like, but electorally, whether Johnson and Trump's positions are inverted with Stein's Clinton is still winning. 

And in fact, if Stein ***were not*** in the race, Clinton would be winning by larger margins over Trump, because by probabilistic reasoning [assuming that Johnson would be the second choice for Stein supporters], Johnson would ***still*** not be beating Clinton even with Stein's cumulative share.

So, in other words, not only would your assertion that Trump and Clinton are equally hated to be ***reductive***, it also would more probably than not be ***offensive*** to a whole bunch of voters who actually like Clinton and/or her policies. (Look at the same collection of polls I linked to above).

I myself happen to like both Clinton and her policies, **beyond** any pragmatic consideration ***out of the candidates we have*** (I would have preferred Elizabeth Warren and I was heavily involved with a draft campaign for her before the primaries officially started). 

But, if you want to shift the conversation from ***electorally probabilistic arguments*** to arguments of ***policy***, I'd be more than happy to. Just know that it is generally the case that policy positions are more correlative with popularity/likeability and vote share/electoral positions. Which would mean that more voters ***like*** more of Clinton's policies than ***both*** Trump's ***and*** Johnson's. 

**Edit**: Now, I would like to continue this conversation, but that would have to wait until tomorrow or another time, since I am heading to sleep now and have work to do during the day tomorrow. So, goodnight, and if you want to continue this conversation, I'll see you on here tomorrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  1.) Candidates are entitled to our votes

I never said this, but this is largely correct in a way you don't seem to understand. You owe it to the citizens ***citizens*** who are most ideologically aligned with you to amplify their votes. By voting for the candidate who is by all current measures losing, you are **a)** not doing this,
 and
**b)** Voting for the next runner-up, which would in theory be for Johnson, but by all current measurements, his electoral performance will not by enough to win, which therefore means you'd only be denying the friends you most ideologically align with an amplified vote.

 2.) Jill Stein can never win

I wrote that if she replicates her previous electoral history, she can't win. MA, where she ran in, is very blue to deep blue, which I hope we can agree is closest to being hospitable territory for the Green and Democratic Party on the political spectrum than it is to the Republican Party. If you'd agree with this statement, you'd effectively be acknowledging that ***yes, assuming that she replicates her past performance, it's a very high likelihood that she loses in a purple or red state*** 

America is, in general terms, a ***"purple" country***. Therefore, if you agree that replicating her electoral history wouldn't be enough for her to win in a purple or red state or a purple **country**, your vote will be subsumed by the vote share of the next runner-up. And assuming that the next runner-up does not win, that vote share will be subsumed by Trump's.

Now, by drawing up a straw man by saying that I was saying that **candidates** are entitled to our votes, you win your own argument. But that's ***not*** what I was saying at all.

Those most closely ideologically-aligned to you deserve your vote in order to ***amplify theirs*** - or at least this should be true if you don't want the candidate that is totally opposite of your ideological stance to become President. So, I guess I would agree that ***candidates*** don't deserve your vote, but those most closely ideologically-aligned with you ***deserve*** to be ***empowered*** by your vote. 

It seems that you are assuming that I am assuming that our democracy is something that is up to the predilection of the ***individual***, which would be wrong. I believe, like our Founders of our republican democracy believed, that the function of the vote is to preserve the consensus of the community and to ensure the stable movement of the party system towards the next favorable consensus. And since Hillary Clinton is beating Trump for the top spot in the general election, I am assuming that the consensus of the majority of citizens is that they prefer Clinton to be their President and not Trump.

I'm assuming that those you most care about would rather this to happen. Or, if like you, they assume that neither Trump or Clinton would become President, they'd equally be as wrong in their calculations. 

So, if you want to maintain consistency, these two statements you made cannot equally be true:

 This is true, and sad. I don't want to vote "against" someone, I want to vote "for" someone. That's why I'm voting for the candidate that wants to dismantle the broken two-party system.

and this:

  So, my vote for Stein is a vote against Trump AND Hillary.

If you insist that you can somehow cobble these two outcomes together, you'd be saying that theoretically, you'd want ***no parties***, which is an impossibility in our current form of presidential democracy. Therefore, in this current system, you are constrained in supporting one of the major parties.

Now, explaining this does not mean I think the presidential system is the best. I personally would like a parliamentary democracy, which Bernie Sanders himself says is more hospitable territory for third or even fourth parties. But like Bernie Sanders said in his endorsement speech for Clinton, we sadly do not live in a political system that can sustain more than two leading parties.

In conclusion, instead of a protest vote, my suggestion is that perhaps a more preferable outcome is that you ensure that the candidate closer to your ideological position become President, and once that is ensured, you become active with an electoral or even party reform organization like [FairVote](http://www.fairvote.org/) or [The Center For Election Science](https://electology.org/), and ensure that the next President is the more likely one to be receptive to your political activism so you can push the system closer to a system that won't be constrained by two parties.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, so from the looks of your post, I think I might be a bit more familiar with the mechanics of presidential democracy than you are, in addition to being more familiar with electoral campaign history than you are.

In this system, a vote from third parties, while not always been outright a spoiler, has shaved off votes from either two of the major candidates (the **two** candidates leading in the polls).

Essentially, by voting for Stein, you are accomplishing **nothing** but denying votes for either of the two candidates. Essentially, you are tacitly giving your vote to one of the main party candidates.

So, let me rephrase your response:

In a two-party system, a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump **and** against the other candidates.

In a two-party system, a vote for Clinton is a vote for Clinton **and** against the other candidates.

A vote for Stein is for Stein *and* against the other candidates.
 
And assuming we can agree on **basic facts**, Hillary Clinton will either win or lose by slim margins. She is now leading, but that is among the voters already likely to vote. Which means, a vote for Trump **shaves** off her lead. 

Which brings me to my previous point: ** in all of her electoral campaign history, *nothing* indicates that a vote for Stein would assure a victory. You'd effectively be ensuring **nothing** except the possibility that Clinton would lose to Trump by a very slim margin.

Meaning, to reiterate, ***you'd in effect be giving your vote to Trump by voting for Stein***.

And, as you say, doing so would defeat your own purpose. </TEXT>

Fact is, she's being irresponsible by not clarifying that choice to her supporters, and by not being truthful of her actual electoral campaign history [and no, I would not define it a **"success"** as she has]. Bottom-line: **She has lied to her supporters out of omission**. And she does this, **while she insists that Hillary Clinton should not be able to do the same**.

	<TEXT> Since WSJ selectively uses paywalling, here is the full text:

 During October 2013, the month after lane closures at the George Washington Bridge choked Fort Lee, N.J. with five days of traffic, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie discussed the fallout from the closures, the governments star witness testified Tuesday.

 He testified that the two governors agreed that a report would be issued saying the lane closures were a traffic study, and the New Jersey side of the Port Authority would accept responsibility. Then, he testified, the New York head of the agency would sign off on it.

 My understanding at the time was that that would put an end of this issue, David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official, said in U.S. District Court in Newark.

 A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo attacked the testimony, saying the governor had played a positive role in the episode. It was our executive director who blew the whistle and ordered the bridge reopened. To be clear, no such conversation between the governors happened, in fact no report of any kind was ever done, and whatever the admitted bridgegate architect thought or dreamt about New Yorks involvement has no basis in fact.

 A spokesman for Mr. Christie had no immediate comment.

 The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the governors spoke privately in early December 2013, when Mr. Christie, a Republican, called Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, to express frustration that Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye had been pushing too hard to investigate the lane closures.

 Following that story, Mr. Cuomo, publicly backed Mr. Christies traffic study explanation for the closures, saying at a news conference that Im sure it is as Gov. Christie says it is. At the time, Mr. Foye, a Cuomo appointee, had already testified under oath that no such study existed.

 On Tuesday, attorney Michael Critchley, who represents defendant Bridget Kelly, continued his cross examination of Mr. Wildstein by focusing on the effort to contain the fallout from the closures, which he said ensnared high-level officials in the governors officebut not his client.

 Ms. Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are on trial for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to cause traffic jams in Fort Lee. N.J., to punish the boroughs Democratic mayor for not endorsing Mr. Christie, a Republican.

 Mr. Christie hasnt been charged with wrongdoing and has repeatedly denied knowledge of the lane closures before and while they occurred.

 During cross examination, Mr. Critchley portrayed the time after the lane closures as one in which high-level staffers in the governors office were trying to contain political fallout from the closures.

 Asked about the plan regarding the report, Mr. Wildstein said he understood that Mr. Foye, the Port Authoritys executive director, would sign off on it.

 You felt that Foye would sign it because you believed Albany had told Foye to, quote, lay off Christie, Mr. Critchley argued. Mr. Wildstein said that was his understanding, based upon conversations with David Samson, the Port Authoritys former chairman, and Mr. Baroni.

 Mr. Foye has said he wont comment during the trial, and a Port Authority spokesman declined to comment on the substance of Mr. Wildsteins testimony.

 Mr. Critchley also focused his questioning Tuesday on the preparation for Mr. Baronis November 2013 testimony defending the lane closure to a legislative committee in Trenton. During that testimony, Mr. Baroni said the closures were a traffic study. Mr. Wildstein has testified this was a cover story.

 According to Mr. Wildstein, those involved planning the report claiming there was a traffic study included aides to both Port Authority officials appointed by Mr. Christie and aides to Mr. Christie himself.

 Ms. Kelly had nothing to do with that report? Mr. Critchley, the defense attorney who represents Ms. Kelly, asked.

 No sir, she didnt, Mr. Wildstein said.

 One text message shown in court was from a policy adviser at the Port Authority at the time. Handed off the packet to Nicole a few minutes ago, read the text, which was sent on Nov. 25, 2013. The package, Mr. Wildstein said, referred to the report.

 The governors office said they didnt want any emails? the attorney asked.

 That was correct, Mr. Wildstein said.

	<TEXT> Abstract: 

 Big data refers to the ability to gather large volumes of data, often from multiple sources, and with it produce new kinds of observations, measurements and predictions. Commercial applications of big data deserve ongoing scrutiny given the speed at which both the technology and business practices are evolving. One of the many questions raised by big data is whether companies will use the information they harvest to more effectively charge different prices to different customers, a practice that economists call price discrimination. Economics suggests that many forms of differential pricing, such as senior citizen discounts at the box office or tiered pricing for air travel, can be good for both businesses and consumers. However, the combination of differential pricing and big data raises concerns that some consumers can be made worse off, and have very little knowledge why. This report finds that many companies already use big data for targeted marketing, and some are experimenting with personalized pricing, though examples of personalized pricing remain fairly limited. While substantive concerns about differential pricing in the age of big data remain, many of them can be addressed by enforcing existing antidiscrimination, privacy, and consumer protection laws. In addition, providing consumers with increased transparency into how companies use and trade their data would promote more competition and better informed consumer choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope. In using the food/recipe analogy, it seems as if you were trying to dismiss the relevancy of this article based on an arguably misguided notion that Elon doesn't find climate change as urgent as other human needs that you see as interchangeable.

Yet, in acknowledging that your "point" was the irrelevance of your own food/recipe analogy, you acknowledged that climate change is an existential threat that Elon distinguishes in importance and urgency from "more mundane" existential threats.

Bottom-line, I don't think Elon would be comfortable with a President who advocates a hands-off approach to climate change. In saying that the government should not do anything about climate change because the sun will inevitably destroy the Earth one day, Gary Johnson offered a defeatist mindset that Musk himself explicitly and categorically rejected.

I quote Musk here: ***"If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.***

It is clear to me that Elon Musk would ***not*** be comfortable with Gary Johnson's myopic attitude toward an existential threat Musk clearly finds urgent, even if he finds that the odds are against a solution.

Now, if you personally support Johnson or his approach to climate change, that's your prerogative. But now that the overwhelming evidence and wealth of public statements by Musk suggests that he ***would strongly disagree with Johnson***. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, so you ***do*** know the difference between an actual argument and a straw man argument. ***Thank goodness***. Then that should mean you know that Tomasky never actually implied that Trump would intend for a supporter to murder someone.

Oh, and I do think you know what I meant up above. What you might think you're pointing out is the difference between stylistic rhetoric and logic. Above, you clearly demonstrated the capacity to know the difference. So I hope for your sake you're just playing the insufferable troll.

If you were truly engaging this so-called conversation honestly, ***clearly*** the "them" that you emphasized could interchangeably apply to ***BOTH*** Trump and the inciter [and ***incited***] to violence.  

Huh, interesting how you want to cut through someone's article without even reading the relevant section that explains the central point and still ignore when quoted for you, yet you quote me ***perfectly***.

In case you're lost here, you were played. 

PS: I you want a little pointer, replace "them" with "Trump" ***or*** "inciter," and you come to the same exact implication 

The President, as our Commander in Chief, is supposed to be a representative of our constitutional history, and an embodiment of our nation's authority. So you see, it doesn't matter if Trump is not his supporter. Trump uses his authority as presidential candidate when he incites violence at his rallies. What Tomasky is saying is that even if Trump does not explicitly call for someone's murder from the Oval Office [if elected], a shitload of crazy supporters will see that the nation elected this man, and think to themselves that by doing so, the nation gave them implicit permission to kill, hurt, and assault people Trump doesn't like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. People have murdered others, and cited Trump and things that he says as inspiration. 

2. When individuals murder in the name of "Islam", we generally don't elect them President and give them authority over an entire country's military. 

3. Learn how to read. Nowhere did Tomasky right that this needs to be intentional on the part of Trump. Tomasky simply wrote that Trump won't be careful with his words, say something stupid like he did about the "Second amendment people" thing he said before or that Hillary would be murdered without Secret Service protection, and someone would take him seriously enough to do it.

Since you don't seem to like to read what you disagree with, here you go:

 Maybe you dont care enough about Hillary Clintons life to be outraged about this. So think ahead to a Trump presidency. Hes capable of saying something similar about anyone who crosses hima liberal judge, a by-the-book bureaucrat, a left-wing academic, whatever. **And then suppose one of his followers actually takes him up on it.** Imagine explaining to your kids why the president of the United States incited a murder. And then imagine your kids asking if you voted for him, and you explaining that well, before the election, you just didnt see much difference between the two.

	<TEXT> Last time I checked, the "hypothetical" Tomasky puts forward has actually come a lot closer to happening than yours. 

I urge you to look at how violent hate crimes have gone up since this election season, and look at how many of the perps cited Trump as inspiration. 

Now, if you have never heard of any of these incidents, that's not because they have not been happening - it's because you've not been paying attention. Just because you are protected in your bubble doesn't mean these things stop happening. You have the luxury of ignoring something others can't.

Quite frankly, you should be embarrassed using the "Lizard Overlord" and "Chtulu" "hypothetical". If you don't see a major difference between the first "hypothetical" and your own, you need to re-familiarize yourself with the difference between possibility and fiction. And then you might learn that "hypothetical" means something completely different than what you seem to think it does. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the Weimar Republic, the Communists thought the same way, and decided the Social Democrats were too centrist. Together, they had a winning coalition. But then, the Communists decided the Social Democrats were not pure enough for their political revolution. 

So, instead of working on building a coalition where they had a definite shot at an influence, the Communists decided to withdraw from electoral politics. For them, letting the system blow up was preferable than being a a member of a ruling coalition with Social Democrats.

You know what happened after they abandoned that coalition? Nazi Germany. [The end result of their "political revolution" was the murder of 6 million people.](http://prospect.org/article/bernie-hillary-and-ghost-ernst-thalmann) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He succeeded by helping LBJ reach white moderates and convincing Malcolm X to tone down long enough to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

MLK and LBJ formed a coalition, and they could not have done what they did if they kept only speaking to their bases. Both of them knew it, and both of them knew they needed the other to translate the other to expand both of their bases of support. Thinking that sustainable political revolution can come without a coalition is simply without historical precedent. 

I suggest you actually research the history of nonviolent revolution and research the strategies of nonviolent conflict. None of those strategies included subjecting an entire country to 50 years of right-wing/conservative jurisprudence [as you'd in effect be doing by allowing Trump to put two to three lifetime appointees on the Supreme Court).

So again, I say it's good to research candidates, but then ***you*** have to research ***history***. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you seem to be missing my point.

No matter how much you disagree with Clinton, or are disappointed in President Obama, you'd never hear them campaign on ideology tests, or xenophobia, or nativism, or the incitement of violence.

And so, that's also a ***huge*** difference for this very simple reason: ***racist assholes will see an avowed racist become president, and they will start thinking that you can be an open racist and still be successful in national politics***.

One case in point: David Duke, ex-KKK Grand Wizard, explicitly said that Trump's success on the campaign trail inspired him to get back into politics.

So, you see, the distinction ***is*** the point. Electing Trump means showing his racist supporters that it's OK to campaign openly on hate, fear, bigotry, and misogyny. By allowing Trump to be elected, you're in effect telling them ***"it's OK to be racist."*** You can add on "... as long as you're not a neoliberal corporatist" to that all you want, but you'll still be sending a very clear message that this country would rather have an open racist as president [who very explicitly said that lower-income communities of color should be policed even more] than a woman who I hope you admit at the ***very least*** would never think of using the campaign trail to incite hate crimes or transphobic violence.

I assume you are familiar with the importance of symbolism in politics since you refuse to vote for the Democrat in the race, so you must realize that this election is about more than policy. ***It's the culture and values we want to teach our kids and their generation to take into to their own future***. 

The Supreme Court has done more to shape our legal, social, and political culture than arguably any other institution in our country. I'm not willing to let Trump shape that for 50 years [at the very least].

So, you may rightfully say racism and hate have always been with us, but pointing out the distinction between Trump and his supporters is ***exactly*** my point: electing Trump will say to ***them*** that they don't hide their racism, or use the excuse of any extrajudicial for of justice,  etc. By electing Trump, you're telling entire communities that their prejudices are acceptable in our social, legal, and moral systems. You're telling entire transphobic states in the South that more of their businesses will be protected if they discriminate. You're telling police departments that police brutality can be justified because their President Trump [who you were OK with getting into office], said that "the problem" with police brutality in lower-income communities of color was because of ***under-policing*** and ***not enough harassment***. 

I'm unwilling to send that message to his supporters. There's a difference between institutional racism and out-and-out racism. The former is covered-up and hidden. It's concealed. And because of that, it can be exposed for its hypocrisy and fought, and can be dragged into the light to be publicly shamed. ***Out-and-out racism*** is when a candidate doesn't even ***hide*** the fact that he inspires anti-immigrant violence, only calling them ***'crimes of passion'***. there's not light to drag him into to publicly shame him. And that means his supporters won't be afraid either of any such publicity. On the contrary, they'll start thinking that racism should be openly celebrated.

[If Trump becomes President, racism won't have to hide behind institutions any longer.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6l0Qb6Xlaw)
