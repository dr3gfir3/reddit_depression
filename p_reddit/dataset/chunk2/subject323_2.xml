	<TEXT> May 19th, 2016 ---------------------------------------------------------

From Vryce,

Things are rocking. I know it does not seem like it but from my 
perspective, right now, things are rocking. If you have read the logs from 
beyond and the news you know why we hit a wall. Things are rocking now 
though and I just wanted everyone to know and to give me a another week or 
two. There are many awesome things coming and many events planned. Thank 
you again for your patience. 

Anyways I have an odd request. Most of you are founders. HELP FOUNDERS for 
more info. What will you found? It doesn't say! When will the FOUNDING 
happen? Soon! What are we founding!? What does that even mean? CHANGES 
UPCOMING shows when the founding happens, soon! We will start to market 
the game before that though, right after the next big feature, homes. 

So anyway oddly enough, to prepare for the founding we have the 'Log from 
beyond'. Yep, the game you play is OUT THERE, have faith, it is part of 
the plan and the plan is magic.

In preparation I need most of the founders to do something for me. I need 
*** Press return or Q to abort *** 

most of you to think deeply about something and email me one sentence with 
the subject as one word, God. The one sentence is - if you were 
interviewing God for the public, what is your first question? This is 
anonymous and only I will read it. Make it one sentence only. Make it 
real. Make it true. Think about it a while. If you were actually really 
interviewing God and this was not you emailing me and this is your one 
real communication with God, what would your first question be for God to 
answer and for the public and the masses of everyone to read for all 
eternity? What is your first question?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Email: vryce@medievia.com
Subject: God

One simple first question to God to answer for everyone to read.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please email me by the end of the weekend, so by the end of this Sunday 
May the 22nd. If you want to help me, this helps. It means I can keep 
working on coding the features and not have to think about what this big 
first question should be. I will read everyone's responses. I read and 
comprehend so very fast you cannot imagine. After reading enough I will 
*** Press return or Q to abort *** know what the question should be. There will be other questions but this 
is the first one so it is too important for anyone but the masses as a 
whole to ask. I should not be the one to decide. It would not have God's 
blessing that way. Medievia Gods and the enclave, I truly expect you guys 
to email me. Founders, I hope most of you email me. Everyone else, please 
by all means email me. Flood me with emails, all one simple sentence and 
that is it. Not one other word for me to read about anything else. 

You are interviewing God for the masses, what is your first question? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just so you know, it's been mainly my US thats been blinking. In fact, it's been blinking since the recent outage last week.

Secondly, my speeds are as per my plan, 35 up and 5 down. The connection seems stable, but, I've never had blinking DS or US issues, except for when I first got my service, and a simple power cycle of my modem fixed it.

Every time I power cycle my modem, it still has the US as blinking. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My US has been blinking constantly for the past week. My DS was blinking for the past 2 days, but is now solid.

My Speeds don't seem affected as it's 35 down and 5.5 Up.

Just wondering why this is happening though, and if anyone else is afflicted in my area. I'm Burnaby/Vancouver region.

I'm assuming it's a channel bonding issue, and if these typically clear themselves up over a period of time. 

I recently had my first internet outage about a week ago also, so I'm assuming shaw may have had some update or overhaul to their system at that time, which last over a couple of hours.

I phoned into teksavvy tech support, and he wanted me to check my mode, but doing 192.168.100.1, wouldn't let me connect to my modem even though it was directly connected to my laptop through ethernet.

My modem is a Thompson DCM475 I think.

Thanks in advance for any input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its not about more or less responsible. It's about the landlord providing a tenable dwelling.

Landlords are human beings though, and they make mistakes. It's up to you to draw attention to YOUR concerns. With that said, as I stated before, you should have approached your landlord and made it known that this is unacceptable, and the fact that heating must be provided to your dwelling isn't something up for debate.

Then you can move on and have your landlord provide an alternative measure, like providing a portable heating unit, or installing an individual unit heating system.

You can't sit idly by and accumulate "damages". Thats not how the courts work. You need to exhaust your options, then you can seek civil remedies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The dwelling MUST be tenable.

With that said, heating must be provided. But, the landlord at the lease agreement may charge you, or include such a service.

The problem is, you can't just sit there idly for months and then all of a sudden raise a grievance expecting restitution. You can approach her and ask her for some compensation for dealing with the cold for the past few months, but she is not obligated to do so. The proper way of doing it is, vocally raise your concern, then send them a written request, if they fail to rectify the issue, give them a warning that you will go to the tenancy board, if they still fail to fix the issue, file a complaint with the tenancy board.

Tenants have rights, but you must be both proactive and reactive when enforcing them for yourself. You can't sit there, accumulate "damages", then go after your land lord.

Next time, when you notice an issue, and bring it up to your landlord, give them an ultimatum, either they fix the issue, or you bring the issue to the tenancy board. </TEXT>

Absolutely erroneous this is being down voted. His issue isn't that complicated and a simple call to his tenancy board will outlay his rights and what the law says about what is a tenable and legal dwelling. 

"Get a lawyer", should only be for complicated issues where he would be evicted without remedy. He can barely afford rent, yet he should waste his time looking for a lawyer whom may or may not take his case *pro bono*. He needs to phone the tenant board first and foremost, then worry about a lawyer if he finds that he's in a position to sue for damages. </TEXT>
