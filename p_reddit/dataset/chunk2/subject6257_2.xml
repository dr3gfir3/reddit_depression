	<TEXT> Well, i also saw that the engine actually doesn't add up extra braking power, they say it's better to use the clutch while braking because it has no difference in stopping power, only that it keeps you safe from accidently throttling while using the front brake </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well another question, i see in youtube comments people saying that you should not use the clutch while braking (they say you're giving away alot of engine breaking, is that true?) and also if you don't pull in the clutch when braking, should you do this at high or low speeds or both? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Well i know about counter steering, i do it myself. But my question was someone who doesn't know what counter steering is and rides a motorcycle, let's say he goes at a fast speed, counter steering happens on it's own right? Because let's say you are in the right lane and you wanna turn left, you need to push left to go left. So there's no possible way to steer to the left otherwise it would go to the right? Right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With msf i just meant (motorcycle riding school or however you wanna call it in english) and yes when you're 16 you can ride max of 50cc, 17 125cc (11 kW), 35 kW when you're 20-23, and also at the age of 22-24 you can get a A licence so you can ride a motorcycle with whatever power you want.

So basically: 
A1 licence: 11kw/125cc (17/18-19 age)
A2 licence: 35kw (20-23 age)
A licence: whatever power you want. (22-24 age) </TEXT>
