How do I prepare it? Well. Heat up the water, put the tea in, wait 3 minutes every minute more will make it taste stronger and most people don't like it that strong. Then to add sweetness you add a [''Kluntje''](http://www.clara-teeversand.de/WebRoot/Store7/Shops/61230082/4AD8/8A73/98BA/8D4D/7492/C0A8/2935/F1F4/14002.jpg) and then finally some cream.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is important that you do not try to force tactics. It is good to have a basic concept eg. (T) 3 rushing A while 2 is making noise and going for risky peaks with smokes coming in on B. Most of the time something will happen and you have to be flexible, that's why a really good game sens is a must have for a really good player. 

And a thing that I was thinking about is penalties. I haven't worked out how exactly this should look. It would include stuff like benching and if they dodge too often they'll get kicked out. And maybe small things like pay the next entry fee for a tournament alone or buy some beer for the rest of the team. 

Edit: And don't focus too much on e.g Dust II. Everyone knows Dust II and you can mostly win by raw skill and basic tactics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am by no means a professional player, nor have I ever lead a proper team. But I learned something in my last team. I was searching a team to play with to get better and maybe win small leagues and the guys I found seemed really motivated and then I got to know them better. They kinda were all chill except for the leader, he was kinda angry at his mates all the time for not doing what he expects. I got into the team as a neutral person and I told them openly how I felt about the team and the players. Without a long story I left the team after 2 or 3 weeks due to two main problems. The first one was, which they have nothing to do with, my internet was just too bad and I had to practise with a 80-200 ping which lead to me and them not being to pleased. I can't change that so I had a small break and currently I am only playing for fun. The secon problem was, that they didn't really do anything. Most of the trainings were done without a 4th or 5th due to not being avaiable. Sometimes with excuse sometimes without. Now I told them we can train with 3-4 people. We'll just do some retakes and maybe look at some things we do wrong or just general gameplay. The leader was completly against this and said we can't train with less than 5 people. One or two guys actually liked the idea of training retakes but they didn't really take it as serious but we still had some fun and I got to know them better which in a way fulfilled a bit of the mission. But in the end I felt like that not really having the motivation to show up for training is not really helping. Yes everybody has friends and family and they come first, but it is just like football practise. And I am sure if you want to watch a movie with your friends you can watch that 1 or 2 hrs later in most of the cinemas and sometimes you just have to sit there one sunday or saturday and train and not do something else. 

I am not sure if this helps you but I just wanted to show you that if you feel like things are not really how they are supposed to be talk with them and if they are not able to change ou have to change something, maybe even search a 6th guy you trust that takes a bit of your work and watches the overall team dynamics and problems etc. A neutral view is always good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't focus too much on how to get out and how to get better at the moment. Take a step back and relax a bit, maybe even take a short break from the game. There is no easy solution to this, as we are all different and some things work for person a and some for person b. I recommend stop worrying too much about how you play and try to find something that lets you have more fun playing.

For example play with a friend that is really funny or go onto a Italy server and goof around a bit. Or maybe you like surfing? Then go onto a surf map, put some muisc on, and enjoy! Don't let yourself burn out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Following guides etc to have the perfect sens is kind of good in a way, but the perfect sens is the sens you feel the most comfortable with. A video can say you have to use 2.5 @400 but maybe you feel like playing on a higher sens e.g 3 @400. Play with your sens and get a feel of it, if you don't like it add 0.2 or substract 0.2 and play with that for a long time. And by long time I don't mean 2 or 3 dms.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok first of all, if you have the idea of fixed roles, throw them all out! A team does simply say 'x is the awper now and y is the lurker'. But I hope I can rule that out. Now you have to talk about what your motivation is. Do all players want the same? It is hard to reach one goal if everyone has something else they want to do. The problem is we don't know you guys, and your dynamic within the group. If you have the option ask others, that know you/have played a fair amount with you, what they think about the motivation in the team. 

And if you feel that you want to go pro, and the others just play casual, you have to tell them that and either they help and support you or you'll have to search a team to grow with. But I don't mean you have to leave them behind. You can still play with them and enjoy time with them just don't let them hold you back. Ok that sounded so cheesy I have to clean my keyboard. </TEXT>
