	<TEXT> This doesn't happen to me very often but I'm simply lost with this movie. It was entertaining, well acted, and I liked the structure of the story. But I just didn't get the plot about Living Robotics at all. Here are a couple of questions I have:

* Why did John Lithgow's character call the accountant if he was behind the financial machinations all along? What did he hope to achieve? (especially when he immediately decided to assassinate him and Anna Kendrick's character)

* What were the financial machinations anyway?

* Why did Lithgow have his associates killed?

* Who was the man in the car whom Jon Bernthal's character threatened? Was that relevant to the plot or was it just an introduction of who Bernthal is?

* Was I supposed to be shocked when it was revealed that Bernthal is the accountant's younger brother? I thought that was the only obvious part of the movie.

Thanks for the help uncooking the books on this movie

	<TEXT>  There are no other arcs besides the ones completed by the end when Johnny gets his girl back.

Well, I don't know, maybe I was wrong to call them character arcs, but I do think there's more going on than just Rico and Carmen's relationship. All the characters have their significant moments and go through changes. For example:

* There is the love triangle. Dizz wants Rico more than he wants her and Rico wants Carmen more than she wants him. Rico tells Carmen he loves her and she can't say it back and then later Dizz says she loves Rico but he can't say it back, putting himself in both Carmen's and Dizz's shoes, which is an interesting realization for him. 

* At the start of the movie, Rico can't make up his own mind and does stuff to please others. By the end of the movie he comes into his own and becomes a decisive and respected leader.

* Ace wants to be a career soldier and a leader of men, but after he freezes up during battle without being able to lead other (which is when Rico steps in) he realizes that leadership is not for him and he refuses a promotion later on because he's no longer vain and knows his limits.

* Zim accepts a demotion because he wants to go into battle instead of staying at home as a drill instructor. He finds actual battle more honorable than preparing others for battle while staying safe and he becomes a hero, justifying his decision to become a regular private.

* At the start of the movie, Carl is a nerd who makes telepathic research in his mom's basement. By the end of the movie he becomes a more powerful telepath and a high-ranking intelligence officer with a lot of power.

* Carmen is pretty vain and very sheltered in her cushy job as a pilot, seeing flying as some grand adventure. But later she gets to experience the horrors of the bug war first hand when she thinks Rico is dead, then she witnesses her captain's violent death and then she encounters the brain bug and gets injured.

	<TEXT> A lack of proper sexual education (and the resulting lack understanding of one's own body) might also be a factor. IIRC the documentary [This Film Is Not Yet Rated](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493459/) deals with these issues and it makes a pretty interesting point about depiction of sex and especially orgasms. Showing a woman climaxing is considered a bigger taboo than a showing a man climaxing, which I think the documentary explains by female orgasms somehow being more "mysterious" in people's eyes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  For me, Starship Troopers is just a terrible adaption. Fundamentally the filmmakers didn't get the source material, if I remember correctly the director at one point said the book was dreadful.

A book and a movie can function as separate entities without the movie copying the book. I totally get your frustration if you are a fan of the book, of course, but sometimes a movie can be good on its own while only interpreting the book and taking only certain stuff from it. Just look at Kubrick's The Shining. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the rating system differentiates certain types of violence and its context, so when a cop shoots a bad guy, it's less "dangerous" than a scene where violence is glorified or made to look like fun. As for language and nudity, those MPAA guys are stuck in Victorian England mode. Very, very prudish. But even language and nudity are differentiated based on some rules and context. For example, nudity in a completely non-sexual context is more ok than sex.  </TEXT>

Were they violent? Sure, there was shooting and some blood. But were they exceptionally violent? Not really, or at least not more so than other action movies or even some PG13 films. I think their R rating was for language and nudity more than for violence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really wanted to like this movie but it did turn out to be pretty meh. The standout thing for me was Cobie Smulders' performance. What a great, charismatic, strong female character. I hope she continues playing badasses and get more big roles. Cruise was also ok. He never phones it in, but I wouldn't say he was amazing. Smulders outshone him, in my opinion. I also thought the girl was ok, although this is very subjective for me, because she really reminded me of a colleague I had and it was just fun to imagine her in those situations.

Unfortunately what really stood out to me was the poor action and terribly generic score.

I don't remember the book that much because I usually read the Lee Child novels in two or three days because they are such a blast. But I am pretty sure they changed a couple of things and I'm not sure those changes were for the better. If anyone remembers the book, care to elaborate on the differences? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Keating's students are there to be educated on poetry.

The way I see it, most of them don't really care about poetry to begin with. As I recall, the school is some sort of Ivy League prep school or something that gets you to awesome law schools and stuff. They are in that particular classroom to learn about poetry but they are not at that particular school to learn about poetry. I don't think they care about poetry or find it interesting, especially the way they were taught just the theory from a thick book by a boring professor. At least Keating got them fired up for poetry a little bit, otherwise they would've just memorized theory, passed a test and moved on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please help me find this movie. I remember it from my childhood. I believe I saw it late one night when my sister and I were staying at our grandma's. This would be in the mid-1990s so the movie won't be newer than 1995. Last year I thought I almost had it when I discovered Michael Mann's forgotten Nazi fantasy movie The Keep, but it wasn't it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As someone who's only really seen the Star Wars movies and never ventured among the spin-offs and extended canon, I cannot wait to see Rogue One for one simple reason: 

I want to see the Galactic Empire be evil on a relatable scale.

They are undoubtedly evil and fascist not only in their actions but also in their historical inspiration. But so far in the movies they have committed mostly large scale destruction and warlike skirmishes. It was mostly impersonal and epic. I'm hoping that in Rogue One we'll see them more on a grounded level. I want to see how they treat and oppress the planets they invaded. I want to see their patrols and their arrests. An Imperial prison, maybe. I want to see their propaganda. I want to know if the Empire uses propaganda or if they are so ruthless that they don't care about the hearts and minds at all, instead they just crush without any need of winning anyone over.

So far the trailers for Rogue One have all looked amazing and even though I feel like the latest one revealed a bit too much of the plot (especially compared to the The Force Awakens trailers) I'm still craving to see even more. This just might be the gritty Star Wars I always wanted to see. One that follows Stormtroopers around the corner and shows us what they do to the street, so to speak. I expect that even if the movie disappoints, I will be on the apologetic side of the argument praising its visuals and depiction of the Empire as something to be fearful of.

I'm not a huge fan of winter, but please let it be December already. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Chan-wook Park's new movie The Handmaiden is a masterfully crafted slow-burning erotic thriller </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-29 09:06:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The only other movie I've seen by Korean director Chan-wook Park is Oldboy, which needs no introduction here on reddit. But brilliant as that movie was, I definitely have a new favorite by which I will measure Chan-wook Park's other movies from now on. (EDIT: I've also seen Stoker but forgot it's by him)

The Handmaiden is gorgeous to look at, with lavish sets, costumes, and crisp cinematography. Through it's sparsity of shots and clarity of composition the story is told in a series of beautiful images. I feel like after watching (and re-watching and studying) all of the Every Frame a Painting videos (and other similar channels) my standards of what makes a movie well shot went up significantly. I believe The Handmaiden ticks all the boxes in terms of visual storytelling. There is a balance between showing and telling and none of the boring shot-reverse-shot style we see in lazier cinema (I am looking at you, Spotlight, you bland piece of TV movie!). Chan-wook Park is clearly a master filmmaker.

I will not talk about the plot so as not to spoil anything, but let's just say a handmaiden is hired to take care of the rich niece of a weirdo book collector and nothing is what it seems. 

The story is divided into three parts, each revealing a new twist and a new point of view.  The characters are intriguing and I cared about the outcome of the story more than in any other movie I've seen this year. Betrayal, love, longing for freedom, and (graphic) sexuality are the main thematic elements of the movie and while I certainly wouldn't call it a heist movie, there is a criminal element at work that will make this genre mix intriguing for a wider audience. 

If you haven't seen this movie, you have my sincere recommendation to do so at first opportunity. If you have seen it, please recommend me others like it. I really need to explore Korean films more. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just watched a couple of video essays on action movies and to sum up, good action should include:

- a story

- characters and stakes

- forward momentum for the plot

- wide shots, not too many cuts

- clarity and steady shots

- a good antagonist and a good hero


Are these what you look for in a good action movie? What are your favorite action movies and the best action scenes and why?

	<TITLE> In anticipation of "Hacksaw Ridge" I revisited Gibson's previous movie "Apocalypto" after ten years and it's so much better than I remembered </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-10 14:17:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The direction in Apocalypto is crazy good. At first glance the movie might sound like a disaster: unfamiliar actors, foreign language, simplistic plot, weird genre mix, etc. But Gibson turns this into a fantastic action packed ride with a likable hero and big emotional stakes.

I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but Apocalypto sure as hell feels authentic thanks to the great camera work, costumes, sets, realistic violence and very well shot action. After ten years of CGI bullshit, shaky camera and ADD editing, this movie is a revelation in terms of how the action is presented. Gibson seems to have that shit down to a T and I cannot wait to see what he'll bring to the screen in Hacksaw Ridge with the insanity of WWII battles. Hollywood really needs to forget and forgive Gibson's vices and embrace his virtues because this dude can direct action like few other people today and we really need that right now.

One interesting fact I noticed about the plot of Apocalypto is that it follows a very similar story structure seen in Mad Max Fury Road. In both movies we get a short introduction to the world and characters before the action kicks in, and then everything is on the move to one place before it all reverses and returns to where it started. In fact, if I had to describe this movie to someone, I'd probably tell them it's a combination of Fury Road and Predator with South American Indians. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The internet is full of lists of best villains and best performances in antagonist roles.

My choice is definitely Sigourney Weaver and her Ripley character from the Alien franchise. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Four months ago I posted an infographic about the Solar System that got a couple thousand upvotes. Now I'm redesigning it as a website and I was wondering if any like-minded space enthusiast would be interested in turning it into a functioning site. (images in description) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-05 16:12:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I decided to turn [this infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3t5x0k/to_help_promote_at_least_a_basic_understanding_of/) into a website. I started doing it as design practice and maybe something I could put into a portfolio one day, but I figured I might as well share it with you fellow space enthusiasts and find out if anyone would want to collaborate on this project and maybe even code the site (pro bono, I'm afraid). [Here are two pages (work in progress, but nearly finished) as an example.](http://imgur.com/a/1Eidx)

What do you think?

**EDIT:** I already got some responses here and in PMs so let me elaborate a bit on what I am proposing here, as there were a couple similar questions in the messages.

- I would like to do this at the absolute minimal cost possible. This is purely a free-time project for me, a marriage of my interest in space with my aspirations as a designer.

- I have next to no clue what it takes to turn a graphic design into a functioning website. I assume this would be a fairly simple html site as there are no special animations or whatever (maybe some hover effects, but I don't know yet, the design is a work in progress right now). I also assume some sort of server has to bet up for webhosting and purchasing a domain?

- I know the domain seen in the pictures is taken. Suggestions are welcome.

- I am looking for someone who could take my finished PSD files and program them into a website and set up the webhosting, etc. The technical side of things. As I want to use this as part of my graphic portfolio, I would like to be the one solely responsible for the design, so I am not looking for help on the visual front (though suggestions and feedback are of course welcome!)

- If you would like to contribute some (fun) facts or fact-check the content, that would also be cool.

Thank you so much for the early response and I will get to your messages later for sure. </TEXT>
