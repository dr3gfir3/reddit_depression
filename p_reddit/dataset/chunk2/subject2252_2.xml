	<TEXT> Listen, all these highschool american novels, e.g. How to kill a mockingbird, Catcher in the rye, Lord of the flies, and all American novels that are loved by Americans in general suck. If you don't believe me read Agape Agape, Gaddis makes a good case why Walt Whitman was an F grade poet </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually never read The Catcher in the rye because it's a garbage novel for wannabe well read people. If you want to compare me to a fictional person I'd suggest Wyatt Gwyon </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why do girls not like guys with a good taste in music? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-13 22:35:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel like girls just like to listen to what's currently popular. They don't actually care about the quality or the meaning of the songs. That's why guys with a highly evolved taste like myself have it so hard. Have you ever known a girl who was into Webern? Me neither. Only a few people like myself and Glenn Gould can really appreciate him. But it's the same with non-classical music as well, girls just can't appreciate good artists: Warren Zevon, Tom Waits, Nick Drake, Jeff Mangum, all infamous for being hated by girls all over the globe.
