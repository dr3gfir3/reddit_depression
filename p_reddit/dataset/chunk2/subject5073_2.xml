	<TEXT> When you draft, explain your picks briefly (you do that later, but from your first few, I'd normally hit the skip draft button). You don't have to read the card name since we see it on screen, but X because it's removal. Your first pick (Echo of Medivh) you seemed indecisive, or didn't explain why you picked it over Ice Block. 

Taking a second to explain your decision making is important because that's how a viewer would know what you're thinking. It's a way that sets it apart from me playing Hearthstone. Remember, it's F2P, so you'll have to convince subscribers to watch you instead of playing it themselves, or going over to one of the bigger Hearthstone channels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Editing out the middle actually hurts because we can't see the plays that lead to the situation you jumped to. We don't know what was already played, so we have no idea what you might topdeck.

I like the deck overview in the beginning. Keep that format, and highlight how your deck intends to win. This is a budget deck; Ragnaros is the only legendary in it; suggest improvements (You mentioned Toshley, but he's niche card. Would you suggest him over Sylvannas or Dr. Boom?)

The only things that benefit from spell power from Azure Drakes are Holy Novas, and you already have draw from Northshire Cleric, Gnomish Inventor, and PW Shield. The classic Divine Spirit + Inner Fire could work as target spells for the Gilbin or Dragonkin. </TEXT>
