	<TITLE> Is there any point of backstroke other than annoying other people on your lane? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-18 14:11:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ever since my first contact with water, I hated swimming on my back. I need to see clearly what's in front of me, I don't like running into people or any other obstacles. This however doesn't seem to be an issue for most people I have to share the pool with. There's always at least two people on a single lane and I do my best to make sure I'm not getting in the way of anyone. Meanwhile others start doing the back thing aaaaaand pool day becomes a nuisance when they are going left and right all over the lane, forcing me to hug a wall or the divider (Sometimes even dive underneath) when they flail their arms all around as if they were the only person in the entire pool.

/rant. So here I am asking, does the backstroke stimulate any muscles that other styles can't? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-01-10 13:10:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With the recent movements around our TV table, we started to have some issues with our subwoofer cable. There's a clusterfuck of cables behind it and it was all moved around (We switched to a new internet service provider, which required a different setup than our old one), so it isn't any wonder that something might've happened there.

Tiniest movement of our HT setup (Denon DPB-2012UD drive and AVR-2312 amp) makes the subwoofer play the song of its people, sometimes the wub gets stuck until I wiggle the cables around.

Now, is that an interference issue with all the other cables back there (power, HDMI, audio and internet, loads of them) or perhaps it's some bendy bendy problem? How could I possibly improve the shielding on the woofer cable? (tinfoil wrap?) </TEXT>

I'm looking for one that has preferably no planets, just a nice sci-fi'sh nebula-like texture to it. It also has to be somewhat dark. Not completely, as in you can somehow get around without using lights but they sure make things more comfortable. 

Any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now as I noticed, your crew is rendered "knocked out" after it's reduced to just two members. (This probably differs between certain vehicles, I'm kinda basing it on a Tiger)

It'd be interesting to be able to continue fighting even with just one crew member left alive. We could get an option to move him between positions (mainly gunner and driver, with an option for machinegunner in the futire) via a context menu similar to the radio commands. It would take several seconds for the crew member to switch positions, and obviously there'd be added disadvantages (Driver is not skilled with gunnery, not to mention long reload time and vice versa.)

Why? Because I feel it'd add an intesting "last stand" aspect into the game, and [obviously, this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzgPXOw2plI#t=66) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Suggestion] "Dynamic" music. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-12 12:18:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I love the music in Space Engineers. However, the randomness of the tracks being played is kinda annoying and often makes me mute the music in favor of playing something of my own in the background.

I'm building peacefully, and the music wants me to blow stuff up. I shoot up a poor private sail and the soundtrack just doesn't feel right, being calm and almost melancholic.

It'd be nice if the music had some triggers that would make a dynamic, fluent transition between played tracks.

For instance, for longer periods of just building with no fights going on, we could get calm music. If no building is being done at the moment and we just fly around space, the ambient tracks that seem to be bringing out the emptiness of space would come up. And when being 1 KM away from an enemy ship, or when there'd be a lot of gunfire going on, the more dynamic and "Kick some ass" music would start playing.

What do you think? </TEXT>

First of all, I'm sorry for the photo quality. The light conditions are pretty bad and I was too lazy to remove the cards from their sleeves, so that adds extra glare. Might update with better photos if I'll be able to get these in case this post attracts some attention (and I doubt that)

But for now, I'll just take the liberty of listing all of them here. They're listed in order, left to right (rows sorted by rarity):

Mythic Rare

* [[Sublime Archangel]] (this one holds sentimental value for me, as she was my first mythic rare ever)
* [[Admonition Angel]]
* [[Avacyn, Angel of Hope]] (my friends were really pissed off when I got her)
* [[Pristine Angel]] x2

Rare

* [[Aegis Angel]]
* [[Resolute Archangel]] x2
* [[Angel of Finality]] 
* [[Serra Avenger]]
* [[Avacyn, Guardian Angel]] (apparently you can never have enough of her)
* [[Reya Dawnbringer]]
* [[Angel of Glory's Rise]]
* [[Sunblast Angel]]
* [[Basandra, Battle Seraph]]

Uncommon

* [[Archangel]] x3
* [[Emancipation Angel]] x2 (these two ladies can make a lot of lulz)
* [[Goldnight Redeemer]] x4 (amass creatures, combine with [Rhox Faithmender], enjoy [Cloudshift]ing)
* [[Seraph of the Masses]] x2
* [[Serra Angel]] x4
* [[Angel of Mercy]] (use with Angel's Mercy just because names.)
* [[Illusory Angel]] x2

Common
 
* [[Voice of the Provinces]] x3
* [[Seraph of Dawn]] x4 (pulling these at early game usually means that this is going to be a good one)

(edited for formatting. How do I make these easier to view?)

(moar formatting edits. Hopefully the bot will answer now.)

(it either takes him longer than an instant to respond, or only works if the post was written correctly when it was made. Drat.) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, excuse me for not providing pictures of the actual issue, for some reason I didn't think of taking any.

This is my trusty rig: http://i.imgur.com/SSeajHZ.png

It easily reaches Mun, so I figured to try and take it to Minimus, but I'm also pretty sure it can reach even further.

Anyway, after getting near Minimus things started to go crazy. Trajectory lines didn't make any sense, Minimus refused to be targetted - even though I made it the target as soon as I got onto LKO, at some point it ticked off and I couldn't set it as a target anymore. It turned green for a split sec and then displayed "No Target" message, or something among these lines.

Okay, I don't need that. I was very close and I could easily establish orbit. Yeah... provided that the maneuvering nodes worked. They didn't. When I tried to place a node, it started to go all over the place and I couldn't even adjust anything. I could only delete it from the staging view as it was literally escaping my mouse pointer.

Welp. No Minimus for me this time. Among all the trajectory lines I noticed that I can hit the Mun on the way back. Then everything went as planned, there were no issues and in a matter of minutes I detached my "[skycrane](https://i.imgur.com/DXg358F.png)" and [landed the sucker](https://i.imgur.com/L2t3DYk.png).

I'm still kinda pissed that Minimus refused to take me in, but oh well. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After recent problems with my dad's laptop, we're still not sure what to think of it.

The thing is, we were forced to install Windows off a USB drive because it wouldn't read the CD.  We thought that the optical drive was damaged, however after installing Windows it worked just fine, allowing us to install drivers and essential programs off our CD's.

Is it possible for an optical drive to be damaged in a way that it refuses to work on Bios level, yet works fine under Windows? What could be wrong? </TEXT>
