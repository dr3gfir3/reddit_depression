	<TEXT> Censorship already exists on the internet. Child pornography, for example. 

But child pornography still exists online. This shows that you simply CAN'T efficiently limit content on the internet without completely changing the way it works and trying to limit who has access to it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay this was easy to understand, thanks. So companies periodically release more stocks? By doing that wouldn't they devalue all of the other stocks that people already paid for? 

And I need a broker to buy stocks for me?  Hm, I thought I just kinda did it myself... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I think I want to try out getting some stocks just because it sounds fun. I don't really know much about how it works though. I've read into it and figured out some basic stuff but some still seems a bit complicated. So I'm wondering if anyone can explain

- What does "points" mean? When a stock goes up in points it goes up in value... but is one point one dollar or how does this conversion work?

- When lots of people sell a particular stock at once it causes problems for the company. If stock prices are based on how the company is doing, why does it matter if people buy and sell their stocks at current value? What does the company lose when lots of people sell their shares at once?

- How do I go about actually buying and holding stocks? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah fuck Jack. Well, not him personally since he's a dog and doesn't really understand what he's doing.. but fuck the people who use dogs to fight the war on drugs. 

I'd rather see those drugs back on the streets than give you an upvote for this shit  </TEXT>
