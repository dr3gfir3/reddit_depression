	<TEXT> The CD version of the soundtrack is included in the limited edition release of the game if you wanna get one :) The vinyl itself was released to DONTNOD members, and very limited of 5 copies were given out during a sweepstakes during the live streams and during the pre-orders of the limited edition. I believe that you can also get it from the REWARDS from Square Enix site, it takes 600 points to get it, I think $89 worth of items is 60 points though... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would love to see them one day! I live in Alaska, So perhaps I'll travel just to see them one day. I've actually been checking out their other albums too, recently Antidotes was on replay on my playlist :) They are amazing! I actually got the tattoo of "It's future rust and it's future dust" around my ankle, that's how much of an impact this game, this song, and this band had one me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Why Spanish Sahara?**
This song means the world to me, it empowers me. I am so grateful for this game for introducing me to few of the best songs I've ever came across. One being especially this song. It captured me from the start. The cinematography is perfect with it (the memories erasing, Chloe's funeral, and the butterfly.) I will never forget the memories it has given me.

**Why pick *"It's future rust and it's future dust"? * **
Because it means that pain and suffering will eventually fade as rust and dust would. I've had so much suffering in my life, whether it'd be emotional or physical, and I am diagnosed with Major Chronic Depression as a base of it all... and in the end, I have to remind myself that only the good memories matter. Pain doesn't last forever, I need to leave the horror here :) This quote keeps me moving forward when I'm feeling lowest.

	<TEXT> *Life Is Strange* is a choice and consequence-based  video game that is very dear and precious to my heart. It helped me through my suicidal phase last year, because I related to the characters so much and the story really did distract me from all the horrors in my life, at least for awhile. The soundtrack in the game definitely a gem and one of the most beautiful collection of music I've come across, and no words can describe how every single piece makes me feel.

Recently, I went through a loss, and It was a very low point in my life to which I was also self harming but going through therapy all at once. At the right timing on the right day, I received an unexpected package from Square Enix. I was not expecting to ever win this or anything, consider how limited in quantity was produced for promotional purpose only... and it was signed by the voice actors! I was glowing for days and it still definitely lightens my mood looking at it, and I still can't believe that luck can somehow turn around. 

It also gave me the kickstart to collecting vinyl! I only have 8 so far, but I hope to grow it :) I collect mostly of the indie folk/rock genre. If you guys have any good artist suggestions, I would love to check them out!


**Edit:**
The song I love the most in it is **SPANISH SAHARA** by FOALS. It's my biggest coping tool, the lyrics are beautiful and haunting.

*Forget the horror here*
*Leave It all down here*
*It's future rust and it's future dust*

*I'm the fury in your head*
*I'm the fury in your bed*
*I'm the ghost in the back of your head*
*'Cause I am* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I won this from the Sweepstakes ^^' Hence why it's signed by the voice actors... I heard that it's very hard to get it as a SE reward, I think $1,400 needs to be spent in merchandise to obtain it with points, unfortunately :/
But sometimes I think they randomly have contest and Sweepstakes for Europe too! Don't lose hope :D </TEXT>
