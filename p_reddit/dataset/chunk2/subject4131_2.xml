	<TEXT> I very much enjoy playing dota 2 but I have an issue I was hoping somebody else may have worked out. I'm a very religious man and adhere strictly to the church's guidelines. However I am also a very skilled dota player, and through normal play, I often go on "godlike" streaks. This is of course blasphemy and not acceptable. I asked my priest and he said it was ok as long as when I get a godlike steak I say "praise Christ" over mic or chat. This makes the godlike comment about HIM and not me. However he also said at least 3 of the other 9 players must also say "praise Christ" for it to work. If they don't, I must immediately feed the courier. As you can imagine, most other players won't cooperate and flip out when I feed the courier. It's making it very difficult to play a full match and I'm getting a lot of reports. Had anyone else figured out a solution to a problem like mine? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work for the state and was put in charge of a huge sum of money that was to help Newark schools (zuckerberg gave it). Anyway I was looking at different projects and proposals when I got a strange email. The email was from a beautiful Russian woman who was looking to move to the states, but needed help. You wouldn't believe how hot she was, so I sent her $200 to help, hoping it would help me get with her when she got here. Anyway, she kept running into more and more problems, and I kept having to bail her out. After about a year, I realized I had burned through like 40 million dollars! Chris Christie was pissed and was gonna fire me but we're friends from the country club so he let it slide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guy, your music is wonderous, can you use that insight to solve this ancient riddle?
"Solomon the powerful and wealthy king chooses to test his most loyal and trusted minister, Benaiah Ben Yehoyada, by asking of him an impossible task. The king asks Benaiah to find for him a ring, knowing full well that the ring does not exist, which has magic powers. If a happy man looks at it, he becomes sad, and if a sad man looks at it, he becomes happy, he tells him. He expresses his desire to wear the ring for Sukkot, which is six months away. After months of searching, Benaiah finds himself, the night before Sukkot, walking through the poorest neighborhood of Jerusalem. He happens upon a jeweler, who, when asked if hes heard of such a ring, produces from his pocket a plain gold ring, to which he adds an engravement. Benaiah reads the inscription and smiles. He returns just in time on the eve of Sukkot to give the king the ring he has requested. The king laughs and takes the ring, but upon reading the inscription, becomes very sad. What was engraved on the ring?" The Answer is: The ring was engraved with "This ring is good for one blowjob from King Solomon." </TEXT>

Some of us sang or danced, others enacted short plays, and others engaged in sport.

	<TEXT> Would you discuss my confession please?
I recently took a flight to the annual Jar Jar Binks convention in West Horton, Ohio. I did not want to pack my Jar Jar costume as it is extremely expensive, but it wouldn't fit in a carry on, so I had to wear it. First, the search at the airport was a human rights violation. The airport security was very rude, and made me give up the two blasters I had on, then got mad at me because of my elaborate costume, saying it took so long to search it held up the line. Then when I finally got on the plane, the stewardess said I couldn't wear my Jar Jar mask, and the two people sitting next to me (I was in the middle), grumbled because my costume took up too much space and had stuff sticking out. After takeoff, I got in the aisle, put on my mask, and danced and yelled to entertain the other travelers. The stewardess tried to stop me but I ran screaming down the aisle, and then dove into a bunch of peoples laps. I was restrained for the rest of the flight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Emily, can you help me resolve a situation with a disturbed neighbors reptiles? My neighbor thinks it's so funny to sneak reptiles into my house to scare me, such as putting a snake through an open window or a some kind of giant spikey thing in my mailbox. I personally like reptiles but it's scary to find them unexpectedly like that. I told the police but he is the mayors son so they wouldn't do anything. Can you give me some pointers on how to handle the reptiles after I find them and have to bring them back to his house? Thanks. </TEXT>
