	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Have you seen what's going on at [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) right now? Many people are uploading images showing the distribution of a certain country like [this](http://i.imgur.com/dA92oJp.png), which is very interesting to see IMO. So I tried to find such a heatmap for Greenland as well. But neither [nunagis.gl](http://en.nunagis.gl/) nor [Greenland Statistics](http://www.stat.gl/default.asp?lang=en) has such a map. Does anyone know where to find something like this and 
if not does someone know a program for making such heatmaps?

EDIT: If someone knows where to find this I would recommend uploading it at r/dataisbeautiful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like it but it's very similar to the danish flag even though they're trying to get independent. But I heard that some Greenlanders are trying to redesign the flag. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Greenland) you can see some other flag designs of GL and the meaning behind the current one, which is a very beautiful flag IMO. </TEXT>
