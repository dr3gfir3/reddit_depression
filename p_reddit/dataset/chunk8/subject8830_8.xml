	<TEXT> Many of the pedophilic priests were also probably sexually abused, do you think that that makes their pedophilia any more acceptable? I hope not. I was abused as a child and still do not think it is OK. It IS NOT. That being said, the problem is that he is another conservative found to be normalizing sexual assault/abuse. Of course, Bill Clinton and plenty of Democrats are probably in the same boat, but, it seems at least, that they hide it better and don't get caught as much saying stuff about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By your rational, the only people who are pro-choice wouldn't be having babies because they hate guys. Unfortunately, you are so wrong. I like guys and kids and am still pro-choice. I PERSONALLY would raise hell if someone tried to abort my child and am quite disheartened that the woman's sexual partner does not have the ability to stop an abortion, but I seem to be in the minority in this regard and am OK with prevailing laws. I think your argument is completely based equating aborting to murder and use that as a distorted lens to see those with a different opinion than you. You do not need to change your stance on abortion, but you would benefit greatly from trying to understand others. Especially those with whom you vehemently disagree with. Good luck and good day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The question is not about science, but policy. To what extent does the government own your body? I don't think there is any law against me cutting off my own hand, or cutting my hair, or even changing my genitalia to that of the opposite sex or have a kidney taken out for no reason. So, why can the government claim domain over my reproductive organs just on their own moral grounds? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This position is hard to explain, but it probably has a name. With the guy in missionary between the woman's legs, remove penis, place left leg over her right leg (or vice versa), so he is straddling it, then lift her left leg over/in front of the guy. The guy will be straddling one leg with the other bent (hamstring towards his belly) in from of him. Reinsert penis and enjoy a very nice change. Flexibility is not needed, but getting into this position may be slightly awkward the first time or two. Very nice transitional position going to doggy style. </TEXT>

I offer, you only, a money back guarantee on those 3.

	<TEXT> Yeah, even the 22g 1.5 were huge. Also, my nurse said to get 3cc syringes which turned out to be very inaccurate for .5 a week. A Redditor talked me into using .5 (yes half inch)  27 or 28 g .5cc insulin syringes. They do take longer to draw, maybe a 45 seconds to a min. and slightly longer to inject, but not that long (30 seconds or so). Best decision I could have made. It goes in so much better. And I got 100 for $20 out the door.     

     
Regardless, go with a higher guage (25 at least). Even if you use the lower to draw with. I use the same to draw and inject with. Actually have like 45 left of my 18   22 guage individually sealed if you want them for the cost of shipping. Seriously I'll  never use that big again. Good luck. </TEXT>
