	<TEXT> Perhaps my favorite single line of his:

*"Hello babies, welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies, you've got about a hundred years here. There's only one rule I know of, babies:  
God damn it, you've got to be kind."*

Edit: Seeing this one already mentioned, along with my other favorite short quotes, I shuffled through my notes on Galapagos and found this:

*There was still plenty of food and fuel and so on for all the human beings on the planet, as numerous as they had become, but millions upon millions of them were starting to starve to death now. The healthiest of them could go without food for only about forty days, and then death would come.  
And this famine was as purely a product of oversize brains as Beethovens Ninth Symphony.  
It was all in peoples heads. People had simply changed their opinions of paper wealth, but, for all practical purposes, the planet might as well have been knocked out of orbit by a meteor the size of Luxembourg.* </TEXT>

Holding a pencil for leisure reading has been somewhat frustrating for me too, probably because it's not how I usually do it. Maybe try just keeping one on you and only pulling it out in the moment you're struck with inspiration? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Crontab Failing Specific Python Script </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-05 23:33:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I have a [python script](https://github.com/subject7383/jazzyWeather) I'm trying to get to run with crontab, but it isn't working; although it works just fine by other methods.


My script is meant to produce some text and play an mp3 file, but the file doesn't play. I thought it was just some issue with sound output, but setting cron to output a .log file *does* create a file, but it comes up empty though it should at least create text. Even stranger, commenting out the portion that plays the song still leaves me with an empty log file.    
I tried making a separate .sh script that runs the python script when called, but unfortunately that didn't solve my problem either.  

I then tried making a generic script that just prints "Hello, world" and that one worked fine with cron, I'm slowly trying out different combinations of the modules used to see what's failing, but they're working for me after trying a few, even the vlc one for music!

I figure this might be an issue somebody has run into before, but I can't find it online.

Here is the latest cronjob:

    * * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/kyle/path/to/script.py  /home/kyle/out.log

If you want to try the full program, generic .json data can be generated [here](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/forecast) rather than waiting for API approval.

Thanks in advance for any help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm doing a UL split that includes all the major compound lifts. I try to climb on the same days I focus on upper body so there's a solid recovery day. However, I have poor technique and climb overhung routes so my lifts do tend to suffer a little. On days when I lift first I tend to be more conscious of my form because I'm trying not to overwork myself, but I can't climb for nearly as long.  
Typically antagonist training doesn't affect my climbs other than just general soreness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is more a philosophical argument of what constitutes "memorizing."  

I'd say what you described is learning and understanding, but staring at a page that says "ketone + Grignard = alcohol" until it's burned into your brain is memorizing. Understanding would be knowing the nucleophilic nature of Grignard reagents, and electrophilic nature of ketones.  
If you were given a problem where your molecule had both a ketone and a protic group somewhere in it, or protic solvent, you'd know the reaction wouldn't work because the proton would quench your Grignard, but student A who memorized it would just see the pieces they remembered and get the answer wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion, the problem is that it's so easy to do it at that stage, especially because of the way the information is often presented, memorization seems to be the only way to make sense of the material.  
I think that's why, pedagogically, teaching GenChem before OChem causes issues for students; they're primed for memorization because that's how they did it before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd imagine when humanity reaches this point solar farms would be implemented at the airport(solar runways, perhaps?), replacing fueling trucks. The airplanes (and most vehicles) would be running on battery power since "in vivo" generation of solar energy would not be ideal for a plane, so we'll need some major advancements in battery technology, but that's the next big breakthrough on the horizon.  
Given the power constraints it's likely the energy will be sourced from somewhere else though. </TEXT>

After commenting that Daisy and Tom are careless, Nick literally says speaking to Tom is like speaking to a child, appeased by handshakes and pricey baubles.  
The closing line (to me) is basically chastising Gatsby for chasing a receding shoreline, the useless pursuit of Daisy as she had been in the past; earlier in the book he says that Gatsby is pursuing Daisy as a way to recover a part of himself that he had lost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just emailed professors at my school whose research I found interesting for my first lab; then honed my interests there and attended a chem club meeting where a few professors talked about their research. I hadn't done very well in courses my first semester, but my a chem professor vouched for me to start in the lab I went to after genetics; getting to know your professors and asking questions would probably be a good idea. They'll also be able to provide better rec letters later on if they actually know you.

As for internships (which is what ChemE's aim for afaik) I'm not sure since I've never been too industrially minded, but your school would probably have a career resource center who might be able to help since that's a big thing for all engineers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Strange! I have similar stats; but I'm not doing straight organic anymore. I also emailed professors to ask about their research prior and applied really early so that probably helped a bit.  
During the visit weekends the people that spoke to us mentioned that they haven't found GPA or GRE to be indicative of success at all, since they've had 4.0s fail out and 3.0s do extremely well.

You might have an easier time with it after working and growing up a bit anyway.  
I feel you on the break, a little bit of a breather period would've been nice, but it just wasn't something I could do with impending student debt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you've had prior experience with physics   MV/vector calculus I wouldn't sweat it too much.  
I had OChem II + lab, Physics I + lab (without any prior studying of physics), Calc III(MV), and DiffEq one semester along with research and a board position in the chem club. It was really stressful, but manageable as long as things are scheduled properly and you get enough sleep and exercise/relaxation time in between.

It's student/school dependent, but I thought AChem was simple but meticulous; I didn't like the class because I thought it was boring moreso than difficult. Seems like you're ChemE though, so you'll probably think differently of it.

Also, pairing inorganic with PChem II (which I assume is QM) is a pretty good idea, since they both cover very similar concepts (and they're really fun).

General advice:  
Don't be scared of things just because you hear they're hard. When you focus on the material itself rather than what's said about you'll have a much easier time with it.  
Get into a research lab as early as you can! Don't worry about not knowing enough, they won't expect you to off the bat; you're there to learn and they know that. Go for whatever you think sounds like might be cool, it's ok to switch labs (I did genetics for 6 months before switching to OChem, now I'm going to grad school for PChem).  
**Research experience and letters of rec are what gets you into grad school, not your GPA.** Don't go getting straight C's, but if you find you hate AChem, don't be afraid to take a B to flesh out your research exp.  
Don't sell yourself short on your learning abilities, but don't overload yourself either. It'd probably be better to take an extra year to spread it out rather than burn out. Wrt that, get a hobby or two; no matter how much you love chem you'll need a break once in a while. Setting down your homework for an hour to go for a hike/swim/bike ride/knitting club and coming back to it fresh could help you see a way to finish a problem you were stuck on.

Most of all, have fun with it! </TEXT>
