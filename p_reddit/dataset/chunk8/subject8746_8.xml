	<TEXT> My mother slamming the cupboards, and banging the pots once again signals the start of my day. After double checking there are no holes in my black tights I make my way out. I close the front door of the house just as the yelling between her and her new boyfriend Chaz starts up again. Cutting across the park I make my way to the corner store. My shift doesn't start for another thirty minutes so I make polite conversation with the drunkard always posted in front of the shop. He only responds with a couple of intangible grunts. 

I wave goodbye to Darlene as she ends her shift and I start mine by replacing her behind the cash register. The eight hours pass without incident. With a sigh I make my way home. This time I let out a sigh of relief as I don't spot Chaz's van in the driveway. Mother is in the kitchen preparing me a roast beef sandwich. I don't comment on the new bruise on her cheek. A couple of hours pass before the distinctive rumble of Chaz's van makes me hurry back to my room, locking the door behind me. He has been out drinking. His loud slurred curses and her sobbing reach my ears as I try to get to sleep. I tell myself I only have to deal with him for a little while longer. 

I have been slowly moving stuff from the garage to the basement for the last couple of weeks to make enough room in the garage to fit his van in. Tonight is finally the night. The sleeping pills from the shop have both Chaz and my mother snoring in their bedroom. I make sure the van has enough gas to make the trip to the woods when I move it into the garage. The shovel and flashlight is placed into the van. I move the wheelbarrow into their room along with the blue tarp. Taking the pillow from his head I smother him until his snores end. I make sure my mother is still sleeping soundly before I start to wrap his body in the tarp. With that task done I push his body into the wheelbarrow. We make our way back to the van. 

The clearing is just how I remembered it. I grab the shovel from the van and get to work. Dawn is breaking when I'm finished digging. Right on schedule the sun illuminates the blue tarp from cracks between the trees. It is truly a beautiful sight to behold. I pause for a few minutes to really soak in everything. Soon enough I push Chaz's blue wrapped body from the wheelbarrow into the grave. I am thankful to him for being so short and thin. The last guy was way more of a hassle. I abandon his van in a sketchy area a couple of towns over and make my way home. 


My mother has finally moved on from Chaz. She even went out on a date recently with a man named Ian. The new guy is nice and even tempered, but so were Greg and Chaz in the beginning. I've purchased a new blue tarp just in case.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I needed help, but you let me drown

I kept screaming, but you let me down 

I know now not to rely on you

Not to call on you when I'm blue

Now some time has passed, and you've forgotten my plea

Soon you'll forget me
