Seeing as this got kind of popular, thought I would provide some more context. The argument started after a friend posted on Facebook asking for advice on back pain, someone commented to advise him against chiropractics, and neckbeard decided to pop in with his "naturalistic medicine lifestyle."

Key features include "I left college when I found an error in my chemistry text" and "my sexual prowess is adequate." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, so, male kegel exercises literally just consist of clenching and unclenching your asshole.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kegels are a pretty common exercise intended for women who struggle with bladder control after pregnancy. It's just where you squeeze and contract your pelvic muscles. There's really no reason for men to do them aside from having bladder or fecal control issues.

There's speculation that the exercise can also help men experience better orgasms, but by speculation I mean "some clickbait articles on a few health websites." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Elliott brought her to the dinner at Gideon's house in season 1, so a number of his coworkers could have told FBI that they dated. And it'd make sense for them to want to look into her death, even if it ultimately has nothing to with Elliott's hacking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I dunno what shows people are watching where every season neatly and succinctly answers every possible mystery. Sure, feeling confused may discourage a small number of people from watching next year, but I personally think there'd be even LESS incentive to watch if every single question was answered by the finale. Kinda defeats the purpose of a show, lol.  </TEXT>
