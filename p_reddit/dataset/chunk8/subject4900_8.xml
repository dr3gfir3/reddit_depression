	<TEXT> Absolutely, t_d always had really bad upvote to comments ratios...like 5k+ karma posts with a few hundred comments...

Lately, you can go over there and see multiple 5k+ posts with less than 100 comments...and those comments have virtually no upvotes.

The entire subreddit is basically bots and Russian shills now heh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really trying to argue, but in the US it's generally seen as "bait and switch/deceptive" and heavily frowned upon. Hence why you see posts on Reddit to warn others about companies that use such tactics...

The fact that people have to warn others about these tactics also highlights that....No...it's not a common business practice...if it was the common, accepted practice...people wouldn't need to be warned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ignorance that Mexicans are composed of different races doesn't negate the racist intent of the comment, which anyone with a functioning brain can understand. 

The fact that you would think something like that refutes the intent of the comment is just LOL.

And a brief look at your comment history is /r/iamverysmart gold....anyway you've been tagged and will be ignored have a good day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean duh...anyone claiming otherwise is just trying to revise history.

Trump went from polling in single digits to leading the GOP candidates after calling Mexicans rapists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's not forget that the Heroic Tavern Brawl rewards are generated by Bliz and the only cost is "lost profit."

Imagine how popular casinos would be that only rewarded prizes that could be used in that same casino. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their plan from the get go was to use the App Sumo plan as a marketing tool to get eyeballs for their service and then upsell.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/5wgync/serpstat_lifetime_access_limited_time_offer/de9yr0q/

As a future warning, a lot of companies in the Webdev/hosting world use similar tactics...sign-ups for extremely cheap prices to upsell. Only to find out later (with no visible warning on their sites) that choosing a new plan negates all your "promo" benefits.

Cloudways is very similar with their "promo" credits. Siteground also will upsell with fairly deceptive language. </TEXT>
