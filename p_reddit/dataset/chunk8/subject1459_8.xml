a tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances

There's nothing in this definition that specifies "classes that aren't advantaged."

Advantaged or not, whites have distinct interests, values, and experiences and they would rather live in a society that reflects those values - just like every other group.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Goleman is certainly a psychologist. He has done research and run programs for Yale University, University of Illinois, and currently co-directs the "Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations" at Rutgers University.

2) There *are* ways EQ is measured. Here is a [list of several different measures](http://www.eiconsortium.org/measures/measures.html).

3) I really like Jordan B. Peterson, but this isn't the first time I've seen him take a hard stance on something he doesn't appear to understand. Especially since he is someone that still draws a lot of his work from a psychoanalytic framework, which isn't exactly known for its scientific robustness.

4) There are legitimate reasons to question the robustness of certain EQ measures - it's still a fairly new concept and more research is definitely needed. Though I think *intuitively* we all understand that some people manage their emotions better than others. </TEXT>

Some of these are more serious/darker than others (Louie/Bojack/Wilfred). The rest are super light and easy to watch.

	<TEXT> I don't think Watts' point was that the child should be allowed to jump in the puddle (obviously there are practical reasons to not allow them to, and the very next paragraph mentions this is a "completely understandable scenario"). I think Watts' point was that this *exemplifies* an early "divide" between social pressures and individual will. 

To clarify: The difference, for Watts, is when we become an adult and need to finally take responsibility for our choices. As he says in another quote in the article: "It is all very well to believe that, Mother is always right until you yourself are a mother.

Feel free to let me know where I might be wrong or if I'm misinterpreting Watts somewhere.
