	<TEXT> Because we've been using the format for years, and it works incredibly well at the Calgary Expo event and elsewhere. We had more people signing up than we could actually process in 2015 and 2016, and that's just at the Expo itself. It's actually really fun, if you want a third party opinion on it, I recommend asking eXtine.

The format is not blindly used/developed, it's actually been developed over years of refinement, and those developing it actually have won multiple TF2 tournaments.

You should try it out! </TEXT>

MS really put their back into the quality of the product in that case, rather tragic IMO. </TEXT>

It's actually growing userbase now, it's more popular than vista, and people are migrating from Win10 to it. We are paying customers too. I'm not going to choose Windows just to play Quake Champions, I'm sick of MS' bullshit restarting for updates, privacy shit, etc.

I just want to enjoy my Quake Champions in the OS I actually enjoy using. </TEXT>

Nobody is going to pay that close to retail for a 4mo second-hand card, they would be better off to pay the difference for a brand new card and be sure they can get warranty and returns, etc.

Sorry m8, you really need to drop the price to move it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. "Last" gen opteron is probably going to be good for you. Plenty of dual-proc mobos out there you can pick up. Check that out?
2. Ya flashing the firmware on a card is an option, but gotta see if the card is on the HCL for FreeBSD too. MODELS PLSSSS.
3. Going with "older" gen procs means you can stick to DDR3, which is plenty fast, and very affordable now adays. ECC is more expensive, but like ~$10 more per DIMM, and if you're getting a server mobo you really need to be getting ECC anyways. Plus you can add more later ;o

	<TEXT> 1. That's fucking bonkers that a server motherboard has white/blacklisting of hardware. I'd fucking return that bitch of a mobo if that ever happened to me! I'm sure many other sysadmins would say that kind of behaviour of a motherboard is completely unacceptable. So, rest assured other mobos (like from Supermicro, or others) should NOT do that kind of crap.
2. Which HBA(s) were you looking at? It's important to get ones that are known to work with FreeBSD/FreeNAS (based on FreeBSD).
3. What's the max RAM total that you anticipate needing? Server CPUs should give you plenty of cores for such things, but is anything actually requiring high clock speed at all? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so my thoughts in response:

1. What are you talking about intel blacklisting RAID cards? I've never heard of this. Can you give me specifics?
2. With ZFS you don't need or even WANT RAID cards, you want (an) SAS HBA(s). ZFS you will want the disks directly presented to the OS, as there is a lot of functionality in ZFS that literally requires this to operate correctly. This can reduce your cost also, as HBAs are cheaper than HW RAID controllers. Furthermore, ZFS storage pools (zpools) are usable in other systems/OS' if they have OpenZFS support. For example, you can make a ZFS pool in FreeNAS, and if you need to, bring it to Linux if you have the same version of OpenZFS installed and it is expected to work.
3. When I looked at OMV, the feature list didn't even list ZFS, yet a wiki page about it said it does support ZFS. This kind of inconsistency makes me unsettled about the real quality behind OMV. Comparatively FreeNAS has an entire company developing it, ix Systems. From what I see it's night and day between the two.
4. I really am not seeing a good reason here for you to go with Ryzen in this case. If you absolutely must go AMD, there are opteron or other CPUs you can use that would be plenty. Also keep in mind most VMs are more RAM hungry than CPU (not always the case of course).
5. Is any of what I'm saying not working for your goals?
6. You're welcome, sharing is caring! Oh, and if you ever know anyone that needs professional support for things like this, do send them my way ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, well I have a few thoughts here.

1. Considering the VMs are to be spun up for labbing purposes, why do you need Ryzen? ZFS is very not demanding of CPU resources. As such I think you could achieve your goals without having to go bleeding edge. Furthermore it means you can act sooner rather than later.
2. I haven't exactly fully gone through OMV, but from what I'm seeing on its site, I would say it isn't as mature or robust as FreeNAS. OMV looks quite robust, but at _first glance_ I would recommend FreeNAS before OMV. I understand the CPU arch concern, valid one, but as I mentioned in #1, I think you can achieve your goals with earlier tech making it a moot point.
3. If you do go with FreeNAS, the latest release that just dropped, 10 aka Corral, would serve you very well in many regards, including your VM/docker needs.

Let me know your thoughts, as I think you might be headed in a less than ideal direction here ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use FreeNAS 9.3 (going to upgrade soon) as part of my core infrastructure and have done so for several years now. I have noticed zero stability concerns with it apart from when a DIMM went sour, but any computer would have issues in that scenario. What kind of stability concerns are you particularly concerned about lately?

* FreeNAS 9.3 is based on FreeBSD 9.3
* FreeNAS 9.10 is based on FreeBSD 10.3
* FreeNAS "10"/"Corral" is based on FreeBSD 11.x (unsure on exact version this very second)

I can't speak about FreeNAS before 9.x as I only tried it a bit before that, and I didn't notice any stability issues there either. But most of my time with it has been with 9.3. I'm pretty demanding on it too, VMs, and all kinds of other data on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say start with 16GB honestly, if it's for home or SOHO 16GB will probably give you plenty. Another thing to consider is that if your ARC hits your max usable RAM, things don't explode. It just means your hit% might go down and the data might come from disk more frequently than from RAM.

The way the data that's in ARC is managed is extremely dynamic and a lot of elements are taken into consideration, so the ARC size and hit% can change over time depending on workloads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is the amount of RAM you need can't reliably be determined by a mathematical equation or method, because it depends on your workload and other factors too. The reliable way to determine if you have enough RAM for ARC is if your hit% is at or above 80% and the ARC size is less than your max RAM.

For example, a FreeNAS environment I support has 16GB of max RAM, but only uses about 11GB regularly. The hit% is very high, and as such ZFS has no real need to have more RAM or increase the ARC size.

This will change between workloads and scenarios, so that's also why the 1TB/GB thing is also completely bunk now adays. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not 100% sure in this case. ZFS send/receive would be the fastest indeed. If you have another box that you can ZFS send to, set compression on that one, send to it, see if it actually does compress it (send _some_ data). That should be fairly conclusive. That scenario I just can't conclusively say whether compression would happen just yet. I bet it would though, it would be silly if it didn't! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's your problem, never run without compression. Seriously, I have never seen a good reason to turn compression **OFF**. It costs almost zero CPU usage and increases performance on reads and writes. It helps both of them because it reduces the number of blocks that it takes to read or write data. You're not gonna DIE if you run without compression, but seriously, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you do. Turn it at least to lz4, but if you have a good CPU try a higher GZIP compression option.

This is probably the biggest contributor to your less than stellar performance. Of course, this change will only impact data after it's written. So you may want to move data off and back on to trigger compressions.

You can also get per-dataset compression ratios too, so you can see how effective this is for said data.

Do it up! ;o

**edit:** I bolded the part I said wrong. I meant to say I have not seen a reason good reason to turn compression off, when I accidentally said on. </TEXT>

The person in this video said the largest game they'd really seen for this game was about 8 players. This looks pretty good, but I think they're hard pressed to capture a significant audience, despite the quality. </TEXT>
