	<TEXT> That's true but it's a historical thing I think, so hard to change.

I suspect Disney, as wonderful as their movies are, had a lot to do with it by going the fairytale and family route. Fantasia was an attempt to do something different, but it was a flop so they stopped trying. Until they *kind of* tried with The Black Cauldron, but by then people were positioned to expect something specific, so once again they had a flop on their hand. 

Other studios tried to keep some of the Disney elements, yet change the formula a bit with stuff like Bluth's NIMH and Titan A.E. Also flops.

I just don't see any way to break that old school look at animation now. Hell, even cartoons that weren't specifically aimed at kids, like the old WB stuff, have kind of seen their characters repackaged into kids stuff for modern audience, because that's where the money is.

	<TEXT> That would be catering to the actor instead of doing the story, so can't say I agree. I believe they should stay true stylistically to what they're overall doing. In this case we're mainly seeing the story from the handmaid's POV, we're in their shoes, not change it in order to please fans of specific actors.

And besides, she can play moments both big and small, so it doesn't even hamper her.

Dowd could do an entire silent movie about folding laundry or reading a book in only extreme wide shots and it would likely still be riveting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   The scene where the sheriff pulls icecubes from the box, right from the dead girls palm, and eats one not knowing theres a spot of blood on his lips, is a great moment.

That is a truly wonderful little scene. But the problem for me is that much of the film is just a little boring. I watched both II and III again about a month ago, and it just doesn't come alive unless people are being killed.

Don't get me wrong, looked at as a slasher it's actually not bad, just that it's not only following a Classic, but also a surprisingly good belated sequel so it can only seem inconsequential. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If we go with R M being really stupid, what do when then use for genuinely really stupid shows? 

I actually find there to be a ton of clever and fun science fiction ideas explored, lots of nifty and often interesting use of pop culture references and some very complex plotting. Between the burps.

It's even kind of edgy at times, at least for a goofy animated show. Like when we see a society turn a blind eye to a rapist because hey we already made his statue and legacy and shit. 

It's no Fuller House that's for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But I also noticed the distinct increase in quality as the season continued 

I didn't feel that way at all. Obviously we cant be as invested right from the start, but that goes for most stories, and everything else (cinematography, editing, music etc) was already in place. For instance one of my favourite moments is still the fight scene at the end of episode three.

But I recognize that I'm pretty alone feeling that way. Many seems to struggle all the way up to the episode four sing along.

	<TEXT> Yeah, same here. The Christmas special felt a *little* weak to me, but I'm sure this entire proper season will deliver.

Really glad the reviewer touched on how well the action is done, since that often seems to be overlooked. It really is remarkable when they come together to kick ass, drive cars, make bombs and all that other stuff. Hopefully they'll build up to those scenes though, just like in season one. I know many found it way too slow, but I think a good build up makes everything better.  </TEXT>
