	<TEXT> It sucks for the person disconnecting, but the person disconnecting is already going to try not to disconnect (by virtue of wanting to play the game), so players will self-minimise this risk.

But the short time is _great_ for the people who _don't_ disconnect. Honestly, one of the biggest reasons I stick with OW instead of going back to League or playing HotS is because it is so damn fast to get into a game. If the 10 second reconnect timer were, say, 30 seconds, it would chew into my enjoyment of the game a lot more.

There's also a statistical argument here: who's to say that lengthening the time from 10 seconds would significantly increase the percentage of successful reconnects? Maybe Blizzard looked at the data and found that the majority of successful reconnects happen within 10 seconds. If that is true, then lengthening the time helps almost no-one but hurts everyone who gets a leaver. </TEXT>

Outside of missions, there's a huge amount of stuff to do in terms of unlocking missions, crafting gear, configuring builds, making yourself look good, etc.

My favourite thing to do is defense missions. You have an object to defend, and enemies attack it in waves. Every 5 waves, you get a reward. I particularly enjoy doing these missions versus the Infested faction. I take my tanky Rhino frame, equip a giant two-handed sword, and spin2win. Never gets old. </TEXT>

If you wanted to see the data being sent, you'd need to use a tool like Wireshark to monitor network activity. And even then, how do you know when the keyboard would send its data? It could build it all up for six months and then send it at 3 am...

So the better option is to ensure it's not allowed. Check your firewall settings. There's an option to deny all network traffic until you explicitly allow it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  you nit-picked height lol, that was a vague example

No, it was a good example, because every comparable example you can think of boils down to being born with a different body.

 we dont have many Einsteins and not everybody becomes Elon Musk

Four reasons:

1. Not everyone wants to attain that goal. I have no interest in being a famous physicist or entrepreneur. My dreams lie elsewhere.
2. Not everyone who wants to attain that goal is willing to put in the work.
3. Not everyone who wants to attain that goal and is willing to put in the work has the means to do so. If you're born into poverty the odds are stacked against you. If your parents think science is a waste of a life then the odds are stacked against you.
4. Not everyone who attains lofty goals gets recognised for it. You mentioned Einstein and Musk. Do you think Einstein is necessarily the greatest physicist who ever lived? Or is he simply the best publicised physicist who ever lived? There is a difference between being the best and being seen as the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Are they "safe" to use? like can hackers steal your information from these? Are they able to do that?

Disclaimer: not an infosec guy, just a developer.

My instinct is that if this were possible, the device would have to be able to make network requests to send the stolen data to them. But keyboards can't make network requests. And even if it shows up as a USB hub with a connected keyboard   a network device, Windows (or whatever) would still probably pop up one of those firewall warnings where you have to explicitly grant access for the network request.

So, no, I doubt there's any risk. </TEXT>

It gives you a choice of warframe ("class")   weapons, and you can experiment with the different weapon options   switch if the one you pick doesn't appeal. You get to experiment with the game's various movement abilities. You also get exposed to things like mission waypoints, hacking terminals, defending objectives, etc. </TEXT>

So are you saying we can all go around using this word, and just hand out flyers to black people saying, "Don't worry, we're not using it as a racial slur"?

 Are you saying black people who use the N word around friends are racists? Because either it's a double standard, which is fucked up and wrong, or context is more important than the actual word used.

It's neither. They are effectively two different words. "Nigger" is what was used here. The version you're referring to is more commonly spelled "nigga", and can only be used by black people. I won't get into it, but there's loads of reading material around the interwebs. </TEXT>

 have seen a lot of athletes playing since childhood just to be eclipsed by a guy that started playing in their highschool years or so.

That's a very simplistic version of what I'm saying. High school guy may have grown up in a house that watches a lot of sports, or talks a lot of sports. Or maybe he pursued other skills early on that translate to effectiveness in a sport. That doesn't mean he has a magical football gene. </TEXT>

People say a lot of things that are not true. Talent scouts (in all fields) want to perpetuate the idea that some are inherently destined for greater heights than others, because otherwise they're out of a job.

And yes, some things can't be taught. That's because you learn them by experience.

 some people show these from a young age

Perhaps because they are exposed to the sport from a young age.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I simply disagree. Different people are good at different things, but it's a matter of how much effort they put into it   how much they are exposed to it. An athlete's cap is a product of their body, not their innate "goodness" or predisposition towards running or jumping or whatever. Saying talent is a significant contributor to success is saying some people are just doomed to suck forever. I don't believe that is the case.

 While they know as well as others that talent got them there

Or perhaps the _perception_ of talent got them there. They got scouted because the scout "saw" talent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Not necessarily though. Some people are born with abilities that don't require work or special knowledge. They just know how to sing well or run fast. They have to work to refine those abilities, but you can't put all their success down to skill or knowledge. Some people are just incredibly good at a certain thing. That's what I would consider 'natural talent.'

So I think there's a subtle difference between having a body suited to a task, and what people mean by natural talent. The running example is an instance of the former. The singing example is more complicated: no-one is *innately* a good singer, it necessarily comes with practice, but some people have vocal tracts that fall squarely into the arbitrary set of properties that result in what we think of as a "pleasant" vocal timbre. That's still a function of the body! Confounding matters is that many of us sing throughout our lives, so the fact that we're practicing is masked. 

We don't say a guy with huge arms is "talented" at lifting stuff. We just say he's strong.  </TEXT>

Yes, I think you should start with an easier candidate such as a Lisp. Clojure for the Brave and True is an absolutely fantastic ebook that is aimed at people who can already program, just not in a functional way. It's also hilarious.

No, it won't make imperative programming hard for you. You'll just have a better set of tools available to you regardless of what paradigm you write in, and you will better understand engineering tradeoffs etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But by removing Junk's self-harm, they essentially allow people to play him within melee range. 

Because Junkrat doesn't have the same strengths as Pharah.

 That will keep the characters playing how they're meant to be.

You're making a subtle error here, and the clue is in the phrase "how they're meant to be". "Meant" by whom? The only "meaning" that matters here is what the game designers choose. Junkrat used to hurt himself with his explosives, and as a consequence he was underpowered. Removing that factor was precisely the buff he needed to become a useful hero. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Talent, in my opinion, doesn't really exist - not in the way people talk about it. When people say someone is "talented", what they basically mean is that person is _magically_ better at something: they are innately better at it to start with (so when they start learning the skill, they will already be better than other beginners), and they will reach higher levels than anyone else is capable of (an untalented person will never be as good as a talented person no matter how hard he works).

Now, it is true that some people take to certain skills more easily, and reach greater heights with seemingly less hard work. This is not because of magic. This is because they have picked up skills and knowledge from related fields at some stage - even if only from reading about it.

So if you agree with me on all of the above, then it stands to reason that the single biggest determinant of whether you get good at something is whether you work hard at it and persist. Not whether you have a head start.

---

There's a second reason, which is that even if "talent" exists, then praising talent is like praising someone for being white or female. We generally feel as a society that we shouldn't praise people for inborn traits, as they have no control over these. But working hard - that's something you choose to do. </TEXT>

Maybe I misunderstood you, but I thought you were looking for a templating system that respects whitespace? ERB does, albeit with some small quirks.

    class Foo

 A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

You don't have rights relative to a foreign state. You have rights relative to your own state. 

There are two possibilities: that this amendment was talking about defending against foreign armies, or defending against your own tyrannical government.

If it is the former: why need an amendment? If it's about defending against invasion, it's purely academic whether the gun belongs to you or your government. Why write a _logistical concern_ into the _Constitution_?

But in the latter case, it actually matters: it establishes an inalienable right.

	<TEXT>  we haven't even considered how to go about the transitions since the game is likely to be made in 2D.

Why not make it in 3D? Unity for example makes it trivial to apply an isometric camera to a 3D scene, which if the camera is parallel or orthogonal to the floor looks like 2D. That then solves your transition problem: just rotate the camera.

Another idea occurs: what if you show both perspectives simultaneously, side by side (or over-under)? Perhaps you grey out the inactive perspective, but the player can evaluate the situation in both views at once.

 avoid turning the perspective changes into something that's purely reactive

I like your peers! :) This sounds tough, yes, but good design is not easy.

 does having two different styles seem like it'd be really confusing for the player?

Sorta. I think players will understand going in that they sort of have to learn two parallel ways of playing at once. However, I would caution against making the two modes _too_ different. I'm a huge believer in games like League of Legends, where you get like 3 or 4 abilities total, but you get massive freedom in combining them   exploiting their various effects. </TEXT>

Neither of those games use it as a combat mechanic though (as far as I can remember anyway). They use it more for puzzles   world traversal. I think using it for combat (i.e. in a time- and accuracy-sensitive way) will end up being quite stressful.

	<TEXT> Disarm/Blind already exists, but it doesn't affect abilities, only AAs. "Abilities that require the use of their weapon" is _incredibly_ vague. Does Kog'Maw's mouth count as his weapon? Do Azir's soldiers' spears count? Does Jhin's grenade count? What if the grenade is fired by his gun?

You'd have to go through literally every champion, case by case, and define the rules for them. </TEXT>
