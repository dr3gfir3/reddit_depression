My favorite thing about this idea was the diversity of the armor you could use, so this build has a couple other good combos, but this is the one I have found to work best for me.
The armor itself all blends nicely for the style and it provides good poise and defense, but this build will require some Vitality to work right. Besides the armor your weapons are the channeler's trident, and the crescent axe (I like the axe a lot but it is difficult to master). The reason for having 2 weapons is for diversity in PvP. But if you think you are good enough with them individually you can by all means get by with either. The shield is also interchangeable with the Golden Falcon Shield being MY personal choice (it has "Golden" in the name I mean come on). However the porcine shield, the hollow royal soldier shield, or the clerics small shield all working fairly well with this set. And then finally you have in your 4 ring slots the stone ring/ring of giants +2 (Use the stone ring when using the trident and the ring of giants when using the axe as it swings slowly and requires good poise), old leo ring (REALLY helps with the stone ring to get the spaghetti twirl of doom to work), royal soldiers ring +2 (This can be switched to chloranthy ring if you have high VIT), and of course ROB +2 to finish it off. 
Stats at SL 250: VGR 65, END 56, VIT 30, ATN 4, STR 65, DEX 65, ADP 9, INT 3, FTH 6 (I started with the 
This build is pretty viable, very customizable, and very sexy too. I have had a lot of fun making/using it.

 Thanks for reading and I hope you like my build! If you guys want to add to it or discuss other builds here feel free! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK so we all got the sanctum mace in the dlc right? RIGHT? If you have not gotten this monster yet then don't waste your time with whatever else you could be doing and go get it! Now, I know when you use it a couple times your poison bar shoots higher than a redwood tree. Well I have got a surprise for you! You don't even really need that silly old ring and common fruit combo (unless you want to sacrifice an extra ring slot) to be able to use this bad boy! All you need is a little ADP and the poisonbite ring +1 and then you can begin your PvP rampage. It won't go up high enough to poison you unless you swing it constantly. It's moveset is easily its greatest asset. It has both great hammer and lance moves making for heavily damaging combos and surprise changes in tactics. For an added bonus, infuse it with your favorite candy coating. Now, get out there and spread the word of the l great sanctum mace! </TEXT>

And in the room with the corpse and the bookcases there is a giant book upturned and open. Maybe this could evolve into something as well? The shrine of winter also seems very esoteric and unfinished. There are just so many in-game places that seemed strangely developed for how little they show currently. What places do you guys think deserve addition/further development? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For pure challenge. I have played the game so much that it takes some really hard/interesting mod to make it worth it. I love this series, but to that end I play it to death. When I first played dead money, I HATED it. Now I realize it is one of the best dlc's out there due to play time and how hard it is. </TEXT>
