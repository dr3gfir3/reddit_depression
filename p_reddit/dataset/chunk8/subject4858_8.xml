	<TEXT> But realistically what are you complaining about in the west? Not enough to risk lives, things just are not bad enough for the general population to revolt and it is at this point that Marxist/Republican/Fascist/Anarchist revolutionaries try to fuck the entire system up to make lives miserable for people so they do revolt. People can see through this agitation and reject it as manipulation.  </TEXT>

Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable. 
 Mark Twain

Edit : The whole anti experts thing came to the fore in uk during brexit campaign when all the pro globalisation international bodies like the world bank, IMF, EU etc were producing reports saying brexit would be an instant nightmare and these reports were constantly thrown at the pro brexit politicians. The pro brexit politicians pointed out that all the large groupings of experts had failed again and again to predict market crashes etc and finally one questioned the soothsayer like qualities of the forecasting and just said "I think we have had enough of experts". Clearly he had become fed up of these reports going unchallenged and taken as literal fact and to suggest the IMF might be biased was heresy because they were experts. The more positive reports on brexit and experts that supported it were ignored. Then brexit and IMF concluded it had been biased and it had been wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difference is David Cameron had united his party modernising it and bringing it up to date on social issues whilst keeping it fiscally conservative, created party discipline and got into government. And then got reelected. Success and results are the difference between evil genius plan outfoxing your opponents and just hunkering down spinning away in your own omni shambles. 

And because this is reddit I feel the need to point out this addresses only why when Tories do it it is seen as strategy but when Corbyn does it it is described as incompetence. It is not an opinion on the politics or policies. It was not a narrative that Cameron had a track record at winning and in reality was PM. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Plus his golf resort (built on protected conservation area after Scottish government over ruled planning process) lied about; number of jobs created during build, number of permanent jobs created in resort, number of houses built, number of specified "normal" houses built and economic benefit to area.

http://www.globalgolfermag.com/matthewmooreblogspot/has-trump-international-golf-links-failed-scotland/

It is incredible that he will be president, given his track record but more a stunning indictment of the opposition that failed to beat him. Also his attempts to crush the little guys around the golf resort that didn't bow down show the reality of his claims to be about the little guy in USA. None of it bodes well.

	<TEXT> Exactly. The spy you know about is not the problem. Look at some americans spying for foreign powers and it is laughable to think there are not a bunch of undiscovered traitors right now funneling secrets to foreign powers, especially given the massive increase in private contractors inside the spy infrastructure. A grown up would have to assume that everything Snowdon disclosed had already been sold secretly by someone who hasn't been caught yet, has retired and will never be caught.

	<TEXT> It is truly a wondrous time to be alive when a spy chief on buzzfeed says fake news and propaganda are threats to democracy. Thanks spies but I still remember the lies about 45 mins launch times used to justify invading Iraq but oops just a mistake in the report and then Knighthoods all round, Blair didn't get a knighthood he just got millions from special advisory contracts afterwards. This article has a crushing sense of irony but it is not funny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am afraid that after the bullshit MI6 invented to justify the invasion and removal of Saddam (people there warned it was nonsense but the agenda was set for whatever reason) you realise that the boss will say anything. That and the fantasy the Generals were producing about training 100k local non jihadi troops all screened and trained in Jordan. Just like the Iraqi army was awesome when we trained it and the Afghan forces are amazing so we could sort of leave. At this point it is not tinfoil hat to say the aim was to remove Assad and then do Iran, all planned pre Gulf War 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am no Trump supporter but he said reduce corporate tax to bring the billions of corporate money back to USA instead of offshore. USA corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the world but very few corporations pay the rate because of loop holes etc. Everyone (except lawyers) agrees that the US tax code is a basket case and needs to be simplified. A lower tax rate, comparable with Europe's, might mean more tax revenue for the US government. Edit : dv facts is what got you all into the "post truth" mess in the first place.

	<TEXT> Generally the voters remember 2008 and the almost destruction of the baking system they also know the people who engineered the short term profit kept their money now write the losses off against tax and got bailed out by the general public all without going to jail. All this and the political system just said lessons will be learned nothing to see here move on...People have already turned their backs on free and open markets, the trust is gone and this is why people are voting for populist parties whether they are left or right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True and although Trumpettes in USA will think it is making america strong etc it is actually weakening its authority amongst top tier countries who signed up to the deal under Obama's USA. A bit like Poland, Ukraine and the rest of Eastern Europe learning the USA will through you under a bus if it is convenient for them where before they actually believed USA was the good guy acting out of principle and could be trusted to honour their agreements.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Denying facts just leads to the rise of fringe politics. Most street sleepers are junkies and alkies who cannot function in society or free spirits who don't want to function in the system. Most people begging have a roof over their head (might be a hostel or whatever), many at the bottom of society are eastern european because it is easier here than Romania etc. Let compassion be based in reality help the drug addicts and alcoholics get well but don't be in denial. Admit the true numbers of immigration into England and it is a bit clearer why there are no houses. None of what I have said is anti immigration but if you are going to let in roughly a million extra people every 5 years be honest and plan for it. 

Also improve the existing housing stock and remove the exploitative landlords/housing cartels. Build more houses and make decisions transparent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good video, a little hyperbolic but makes good fact based points about Obama and the difference between actions and presentation. In my country most think Trump is a dick, I think he is a dick, which just made everyone say how amazing Hillary was but if you listed some of the terrible things she has done/been involved with they don't believe you. The worst thing about today's political discussion is having to be in Team A or Team B and then distorting  reality/ignoring fact to make it fit your Teams view or defeat the other teams argument. Thanks for the link. </TEXT>
