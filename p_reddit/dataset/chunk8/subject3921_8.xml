A hundred imaginary eyes followed me as I walked through my workplace. Ahead, my boss waved me into his office. I stepped within, allowed the door to be closed behind me as an ominous note, and then sat while he moved around his desk and reclined opposite in his huge leather chair.

He fiddled with something on his desk for a moment, looked at his email on the monitor to his right, and then laughed. Sounds like you had a crazy time over there.

Id expected to be fired on the spot over the claim Id stabbed someone. I gave a neutral nod.

Worst city on earth, man, my boss joked. Im surprised you made it out alive. The veeps are all super impressed you stabbed someone and got back unscathed. It was a thief or a bandit or something, right?

I glanced to my left, narrowed my eyes, then caught his gaze again. Yeah.

Awesome. He nodded absently. Pure awesome. You gotta sign this affidavit that says you dont need mental health counseling or whatever. Save corporate some needless expenses. He shoved a paper forward across his desk.

Signing after a brief read, I shared a polite jibe or two with him and then took my leave. As I stepped back into the hallway with my job intact, I couldnt decide whether to feel better or worse. The Zimbabwean police had claimed Id stabbed someone and barred me from re-entering the country, and *my company hadnt cared at all.* It seemed they thought of Harare as little more than a war-torn hellhole, so my supposed incident had only been natural.

It was rare that I used my office, for I was almost always traveling, but I decided to close the door to the small room and take some time to collect my thoughts. The first email I had as I sat down was from my boss, who had sent it after our conversation: Youre the best in the business, dude. We got your back!

Good to know, I supposed. After a refill from the office coffee pot, I sat and stared at my case report. At a basic level, I was certain there was no scam, and his life insurance payout could be approvedbut that didnt mean I could lay my other concerns to rest. What the hell had I seen in Harare? Or, rather, not seen.

I began looking through open case files for anything that seemed suspicious in a new way. My trained skeptics eye caught upon numerous cases full of evidentiary and testimonial holes, but I was looking for something else now.

There it was: a major theater company in Jerusalem had an outstanding claim over the broken leg of one of their lead actors the night before the launch of a major production. To me, that seemed like an obvious hedge against a play run the producers thought would fail. No need to make a profit if the insurance company can just pay up, right? But in this instance, the actor had tripped in a blank alley, and he was insistent something had been there despite nobody being able to find what he had stumbled over.

Keen on this lead, I booked an immediate flight and flew into Tel Aviv one caffeine-fueled blur later. Throughout the flight, because I couldnt get on the internet, I read through old documents looking over the histories of claims in this area but found little of interest. Stuffing these away once we were finally being let off, I gathered my things and stepped into a familiar airport.

Staring, I wondered if I had imagined my eleven hour and twenty-two minute flight. Had we just come back to our original airport? No. Other than the foreign writing on the signs and shop menus, Tel Avivs Ben Gurion airport was a carbon copy of the place I had just left. Feeling a bit haggard, I asked the balding businessman I had sat next to on the plane, Airports, right?

He grinned. Its comforting. I go to McDonalds in every country and I feel right at home.

Huh. True. I gave him a nod as we parted ways at the terminal midpoint.

Exactly as hed said, McDonalds stores littered the airport and the surrounding areabut to my intense chagrin, I couldnt see any Starbucks locations on the map on my phone. To my taxi driver, I said, Coffee?

He responded brightly, Coffee! and, in short order, brought me to a place whose dual language sign informed me was called Aroma Espresso Bar. You like?

With relief, I said, Itll do.

Coffee in hand, I rode with him to the bus station, and then spent another hour or two looking over the old files on my way to Jerusalem. There was something off about these old cases in the general sense, but I couldnt yet put my finger on it. While caught up in thought, I wandered one of the oldest cities in the world in search of the theater company and the alley in question. Throughout, I had that same feeling from my office of countless eyes upon me; somewhere along the way, I stopped and gazed over a stark divide.

Where I stood, pleasant walkways, nice trees, and well-kept buildings both ancient and modern formed a comforting landscape. Across the narrow gulf of a single winding street, the city to the east turned to ramshackle ruins and ghettos. What was I witnessing? Was this a consequence of the regions conflict-filled situation? A few sickly homeless men wandered at the limits of my sight, and I recoiled from this vision of dystopia. Was that how my fellows had thought of Harare?

Rubbing my forehead against a sudden sharp pain, I sipped my coffee and wiped away traces of blood from under my nose. Turning, I came up short as a diseased and filthy woman popped out from an alley to my right; she screamed something, but a sudden high squeal blanked out my hearing, and I staggered away from the divide and gripped my head until the pain passed.

Were there chemicals from battles or something left over around here? I couldnt risk it. I headed west and put the strange sight and encounter out of my head once I found the alley.

Just as the pictures had shown, the alley was narrow, clean, and empty. It was actually pretty difficult to trip even on purpose; I moved back and forth along the space getting a sense of how the fall might have happened. After that, I gulped the last of my coffee, threw the empty cup in a trash can, and returned to feel around with my bare hands.

The ancient stone held the chill of eras; I couldnt help but imagine all the feet that must have trod this alley in the thousands of years the city had stood. If this place had held a permanent anomaly, others would have tripped and rumors would have built up; if something *was* here, it therefore had to have been a recent development. I slid my hand across the weathered tan stone untilthere!

My shaking fingers traced something soft, squishy, and utterly invisible; my digits shook not from fright, but from over-caffeination. Hopped up on coffee, I let my eyes remain wide as I mapped out what felt like leafless ivy growing on this otherwise unremarkable wall. It wasnt everywhere, and it wasnt very thick, but there was definitely an invisible net of something squishy in a pattern reminiscent of a clinging plant. This time I was wise to the previous reaction; cutting into it would not do.

But now that feeling of awareness strengthened once more. I had felt it at various strengths at my office, on the plane, on the bus, and while walking these age-old streets, but now my lower animal brain insisted with terror that something massive and horrible was about to turn the corner into the alley and see me. Shaking for a new reason, I bolted.

The scream caught in my throat as I nearly slammed into a disheveled older man who was approaching from the other direction behind the theater. He smiled and said, You must be the investigator. Im the director. He held out his hand.

Suppressing a laugh of relief as I realized how ridiculous my momentary terror had been, I reached to shake his handand noticed blood smeared along his fingers as they neared mine.

I pulled back.

He saw my reaction; his eyes flared, and he pushed forward, leading with his bloodied hand.

Counting on my jacket as a barrier against that blood, I slammed my arm against his hand and against the wall. He countered by smashing his face zealously against mine, and I reeled back in pain. His other hand came up, but I braced against the wall and gave him a mighty kick to the stomach. He groaned, and I ran.

My laptop case and backpack full of clothes bounced as I fled, reminding meI took a moment to put them down, strip my jacket off, and throw it away. I was no fool. This was twice in two different cities that someone had tried to get me with blood. Was it poisoned? Did it hold a virus? I didnt care to find out, and this was an indication something was going on, exactly like Id suspected. But what could it be?

Are you the investigator? a new man called. Im the director of the theater. I saw you run. Is everything alright?

I watched him warily, but he was clean and well-groomed, while my attackers had both been dirty and disgusting. Making a threadbare excuse, I picked up my things and went about doing the rest of my job. I went about the motions with automatic ease, for I already knew their claim had been genuine. My concern now was the fact the invisible organic material was growing in two different cities on two different continentsand it was reactive. The reaction had been less severe this time without the penetration of the knife, but react it had. What might have happened to me had I not fled the approach of that sense of enormous awareness? And how were these strange men trying to get blood on me related to what was happening?

That night, I booked a room at a small bed and breakfast with cash, but they still found me as my last coffee of the day ran dry. I returned the headbutt that I had been given earlier and gifted several desperate bites, one of which tore off a nosebut the three of them finally got me on my knees at knife point while their furious lead man held a drop of blood above my left pinky finger.

A single streetlamp radiated dark orange through my only window; by that light, I watched as the falling drop of blood impacted my pinky, bunched upand vanished down under the nail.

Intense terror of the same kind Id felt earlier that day surged through me. I grabbed one of their knives out of their startled hands; I stabbed. I sliced at a certain height. I pushed and kicked; I fought through a sudden impact on the back of my head. I stabbed again. I slammed the knife into a spouting throat. I shoved it under someones chin. They fell.

And thenwhat else could I do? Screaming at the top of my lungs, I brought the knife down and separated my pinky finger from my left hand.

The decision had been made in a split second, but, holding a torn piece of my shirt to my open bleeding stump of a finger, I just kept reiterating the evidence in my mind. These men had gone to great lengths to get that blood on me, so, despite not knowing the reason, I had to stop them.

Id just cut off my own finger. Shivering with shock and gripping my bleeding hand tight, I looked around my crazily blood-spattered room and tried to prompt myself to action. Overwhelmed by stress and adrenaline, my body refused to listen.

My horrified self-doubt drained away as my pinky finger trembled on the floor.

As I watched, a long and slender ivory knife cut its way out from inside the severed digitno, not an ivory knife, but an incredibly delicate limb of some sort. Breathing hard to the point of nearly passing out, I remained on my knees in that thick pool as a spindly spider-like creature of smooth but bloodied bone-white hue slipped its way out of the core of my finger and into my room.

It looked at me with numerous ivory eyes and said without speaking, *Youre a hard man to get a hold of.*

I stood abruptly.

*Dont run,* it whispered in my mind. *We have much on which to commiserate.*

While my head burned in a dozen different excruciating ways, I gave myself one moment of lucidity: Id lost my mind. This was a hallucination. This wasnt real.

I grabbed my bag and ran for my life.

Its sibilant voice echoed weaker as I barrelled down the hallway, out the door, and into the night; still, I heard it clearly. It said: *Your senses betray you. Find me when youre done playing the fool.*

Now I sit in another Aroma whatever coffee shop with a bandaged hand and looking afright, Im sure. The other patrons are looking at me and murmuring to each other. Minus a finger, minus my clothes, and minus a portion of my sanity, I have to somehow get control of myself. What do I have? My laptop, the old paper files, and my credit card.

Im good. Im alright.

Home?

Would theyitlook for me there?

I just have to write all this down so that it is out there in a concrete form and not just a storm in my head. These events happened. I have to believe I am sane, but, if I am, then what the hell was that creature?

More people muttering. The manager making a phone call. Time to move on. Time to figure out my next step.

	<TEXT> Profits go up exactly seven point two percent at each of eleven banking companies in the same quarter. The coffee in my office never runs out under any circumstances. A Zimbabwean citizen suffocates to death in the middle of a crowded street and *no one notices.*

I am paid to investigate anomalies, yes, but I would do it for free if I could. Every single one of you puts things wrong for your own selfish benefit; I put those things right again. There's never been a scam invented I couldn't crackeven if Kudakwashe's broad-daylight suffocation had me stumped as I sat there in my office looking at the evidence, I was confident I could suss out the truth.

Surprise is something I rarely feel, but it definitely caught me off guard to step off the plane at Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, only to find myself in familiar environs. I had been told by our data and by numerous articles that Harare was alternately either the worst city on Earth or, graciously, the fourth worst city on Earth, but the airport looked exactly the same as the one I had just left and it took me all of thirty seconds to find a Starbucks and fill my hand with a Venti coffee.

While riding in my taxi, I pulled out of some my reports. *iAfrica*, 2011: *A top research group on Thursday rated Zimbabwes capital as the worst of 140 world cities in which to live.* I'd remembered correctly. Looking out the window as we drove, I frowned. As an aware citizen of my era, I knew there was often a huge gap between reported information and reality, but I couldn't guess as to the purpose of this spin.

The hospital, too, seemed an eerie clone of the services back home, and I stopped at another Starbucks to refill my coffee before cracking my neck, taking a deep breath, and heading inside to visit the morgue. The doctor within was a dour-mannered woman with a cynical attitude I found delightful.

"Idiots," she said as she pulled back the sheet over Kudakwashe. "That's all. A street full of idiots. Who did you say you worked for again?"

"Insurance," I responded, adjusting the face mask she had given me. "Have to make sure this isn't a life insurance scam."

"Ah." She ran a hand above his corpse as if showing off a product on The Price Is Right. "Well, no scam. I am certain he is dead."

As she was also masked, I could only see her eyes, but I was pretty sure this was our mutual kind of joke. I gave a small genuine laugh and then asked, "Any idea what killed him?"

She poked at the long scars on his chest with her gloved hand. "I did a full autopsy and found nothing."

I saw no external wounds on his neck, but that ruled out little. "Not even in the throat?"

She said with introspective surprise, "I... do not know why I did not think of that." She shook her head as if to dispel some strange fog and then chose a powerful prying tool. "Sorry Kudakwashe."

His jaw snapped open with an audible crack.

She chose another tool and slid the long metal past his tongue and down his throat. Clamping upon something, she tugged. Whatever it was, it resisted mightily until it was practically torn out, and she held it up to the harsh white light between us.

"What is that?" I asked. The quivering stringy mass was covered in moisture of various colors.

She shook her head again. "Unidentified organic material. Could be human. Superficial appearance of nervous tissue." She placed it down onto a small tray, turned away briefly to get a sample bag, and then froze. "Where did it go?"

I hadn't exactly been looking away, but I hadn't seen the extracted tissue move. The tray was emptywe backed away and looked around our feet, but the clean white autopsy room held no spots for a fallen mass to hide. It was simply gone.

After further investigation, there was nothing else unusual about the corpse; I left chilled. My core instincts chalked it up to part of the scam and I noted the doctor's possible involvement, but I just couldn't see how she'd pulled it off. Waiting for my presence to investigate his throat seemed fishy, but I had checked the walls and floor pretty thoroughly. Had it been some sort of sleight of hand? Was the mass now hidden in some sewn seam in her coat?

If so, *why?*

As I stepped outside the hospital, a disheveled homeless man nearly ran into me; he stumbled at the last moment and red splattered on the sidewalk. I leapt back and stared in disgust as I realized he'd just nearly spilled a small vial of blood upon me. "What the hell?"

He limped away hurriedly and without reply.

Shaken by this strange day more than I cared to admit, I went to a third Starbucks, got another coffee, and wrote down my thoughts on my laptop. About an hour in, a young native approached to ask me a question, and I grabbed my computer and held it fast just in timea common diversion theft, and one which I had instinctively seen coming instantly. I just grinned at him and his sneaking accomplice as they darted away empty-handed. That was right: *I* was the expert. *I* was in control, not the scammers.

Motivated to investigate further despite the afternoon heat, I gathered my things and took a walk down toward the place where Kudakwashe had died. He had suffocated in broad daylight, so it was important that I investigate at the same time of day to see what could be and could not be seen. The spot in question was shortly beyond a verdant little park, and, increasingly surprised at how *not* war-torn and horrible this supposed worst city on earth was, I took the paths through the park rather than going around.

How about thatthe plants were different. Finally, there was something I couldn't directly equate with any given downtown district or shopping mall back home! These exotic trees, bushes, and flowers were my first hint that I wasn't on the same continent.

The park opened back up onto the next street, where moderately thick streams of Zimbabweans were walking on either side of light car traffic. The spot where Kudakwashe had died had not been cordoned off or even otherwise marked; I approached by comparing printed pictures of the scene and I stood where he had been found. High buildings glinted overhead. Storefronts glimmered darkly across the street. Ramshackle brick framed my immediate rear. "Kudakwashe," I asked, entreating whatever essence might remain. "What *happened* to you?"

A chill did not pass over me. I want to make that clear. The chill was *already present.* As the sidewalk streams of people moved around me in both directions, I realized that a relief from the heat had come upon me while I stood in the exact spot where he had diedbut it was not because of some spirit or ghost. With narrowed eyes, I asked passersby, "Hello?"

They ignored me.

I shouted, "Hey, asshole!"

One older man stopped, wiped his sweaty brow, and then continued on down the sidewalk.

No. It wasn't possible. They couldn't *all* be in on it, could they? There was no way a single life insurance scammer could realistically rely on whole crowds. Someone would glance my way; someone would react accidentally. I screamed in the face of a woman carrying a baby on her back, but she did not so much as flinchand the baby*the baby looked right past me and did not see me.*

It wasn't a scam; or, at the very least, the existence of this pocket of strange indifference was not a scam. It wasn't just invisibility, eitherI reached out and poked people. None paid me heed. Had someone discovered this spot and thought to use it to obscure a murder as something instead supernatural?

Thinking suddenly of Kudakwashe's suffocation, I had the distinct notion that this spot might also be a trap of sorts. What if it was truly a bubble, and what if that bubble could run out of air? Leaping forward, I gripped the decaying brick wall and caught my breath. A homeless man shook a cup at me as he passed, and I grinned and deposited some coins. I had only moved a few steps, but they could see now see me.

Amazing. Hundreds of people must have passed through that spot every day, and none had realized the truth of its properties. What to do with this? I was paid to investigate anomalies, and I had found the mother lode, but why did it exist? And how?

Operating as if I was investigating a scheme, I began testing out the properties of the spot. On a hunch, I moved into the shade in the nearby park, and then I moved into the spot. I noted: the cool chill was the same temperature. There was nothing supernaturally icy about this strange blind spot, for it held only the relief of shade. I gazed up at the high office towers, wondering if this location could somehow be lit *and* shaded at the same time. The sun burned at the same angle as it had when Kudakwashe had died, very directly visible, and I couldn't figure it out until nearly an hour had passed and the blind spot became warmer.

There was something up there. There was something in the air blocking the sun's heat. Like the blind spot itself, I couldn't see it, but *it was there.* I got another coffee to help me think, and then I knew what I had to do.

Talking my way into the nearest building was no easy feat as a foreigner, but thanks to a small bribe I managed to convince the security at the front that I just wanted to get on the roof for better satellite phone reception. Many stories higher, I emerged into windswept heat and made way to the edge of the roof above the blind spot. Doing a bit of math on my laptop, I calculated the general upwards line the higher anomaly must have fallen upon, and I began throwing pebbles over the edge.

I stared in visceral shock as my fourth pebble arced outand then bounced away. I threw another.

The stone came to rest about a foot lower than my current heightand thirty feet out.

What the hell was I seeing? Gripping my forehead against a powerful caffeine headache, I took a few painkillers and then continued throwing pebbles until I had a basic lay of the invisible thing ahead of me. It looked like a hanging bridge of some sort, and I thought of the optical illusion from that one Indiana Jones movie. This, though, appeared to be invisible and yet cooled certain spaces below it. Were only certain kinds of radiation passing through it? What was it made of? Wincing against a severe pain in my head, I wiped away a tad bit of blood from my nose and reached a hand over the edge of the building's roof.

I didn't feel anything, and my hand went below the level of the floating pebbles. Or did it? Blinking, I tried again; this time, my hand pressed into something soft, squishy, and warm. Immediately recoiling, I wondered if I was getting in over my head. Should Ino. I couldn't leave. I couldn't stop. Having seen countless scams in my life, I knew that if I left there would be nothing here upon my return.

But what was its purpose? What *was* this strange squishy hanging invisible bridge? It couldn't just go to the other building, could it? I worked up my nerve and began to climb out onto it on my hands and knees until I stopped short and asked myself if I was losing my mind. What if this wasn't really here? What if I was just suffering heatstroke or delusions born of some virus that had killed Kudakwashe? All the Zimbabwean police would note was that a foreigner had leapt off a high roof for no reason.

I stared out across the Harare cityscape, struck by inspiration.

The material the doctor had pulled out of Kudakwashe's throat hadn't disappeared. It'd just returned to whatever state *this* material was in. It was probably still sitting on her autopsy tray exactly where she had left itno, she would have sanitized all that by now. Pulling out my knife, I leaned down and, with a trembling hand, began cutting what seemed like nothing more than squishy empty space.

There was screaming; of that I am sure. A choir of screams echoed from the vast gulf below. Someone ran from somewhere; angry hands gripped me by the shoulders and threw me to hard gravel and tar. I'm on the plane back home now and quite unsure of the last several hours. It was as if a rushing dream was blasted upon my senses, and now I am sitting buckled up on an international flight with a stern warning not to return to Zimbabwe. That warning would have been prison instead if not for my specific corporate affiliation; they tell me I drank too much caffeine and had some sort of mental break, but that's not what happened. I didn't stab anyone.

I know what I saw, and I don't intend to let this pass.

	<TEXT> This is the best thing ever to log in and see. I really appreciate your support.

I've also been debating how open to be about the money aspect of things. I was actually looking at all this recently and wondering how to move forward with my work here, because it needs to make more money before I can justify the rate at which I output stories relative to other things I'm doing. I've been worried I'll have to slow down quite a bit.

Even $1 and $2 contributors would help greatly. I just need to see that we're making some upward progress so I can stay motivated. I'm still trying to figure out business models to keep this sustainable, and I see other authors doing similar things and generating the $2000 a month I would need to write horror and sci fi full time, so I know it's possible. Just gotta get there. In the meantime, I spend the vast majority of my time doing grind publishing work, like editing, formatting, uploading, social media, setting up websites, and so on. That stuff is great and all, but I would definitely love to do this full time. My end-game goal is one complete book a month, which is well within my speed and creativity bounds. That would be about 50,000 - 70,000 words, multiples time what I output now.

We could also do Kickstarters or whatnot for individual books you guys would like to see. I'm way behind on getting things like The Empty Earth and subsequent Portal in the Forest books onto Amazon / print versions because I just can't spare the time with current constraints. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an interesting question, because I have always had extremely vivid and overly long nightmares, many of which become stories. At some point in my teenage years I stopped being scared and began enjoying them. The sheer horror of some of these nightmares can't be translated to mere words, and I often spend the first half an hour of each morning remembering where I am after what feels like years gone. Writing things down takes the threat or trauma out of my mental reality and places it into another one, contained.

Some direct nightmare-to-story conversions include [glass spiders](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3luzde/horrible_creatures_invaded_our_house_and_attacked/), [the Dreamer on High from The Moon Aflame](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2tsl9q/am_i_the_only_one_that_sees_that_the_moon_is_on/), [the cursed emerald](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2svss8/i_have_a_very_strange_curse_but_i_think_im_making/), the Bonewalker, and of course numerous elements in the Portal in the Forest series and subsequent series. Special mention to someone else's nightmare as well, the [blue dollars story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/455ktc/if_you_ever_find_yourself_handling_blue_dollars/), as dreamed by my cover artist Jacqueline of [MC2 Studio](https://mc2studio.co/). 

Some of you may have noticed a strong trend of dreams contrasting or fusing with reality in my stories, like in The Fountain of Youth series or The Beast's Realm series. What I described above is definitely a primary motivator behind that theme. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting that you feel that way too about the unanswered questions. That's one of the reasons for this survey; I'm going to cut down loose ends quite a bit over the next few weeks. I think this is one of the vulnerabilities of perspective-based stories. The characters don't know what's happening with anything but their own little path, so numerous mysteries can build up. Fortunately, we're at a natural point to solve some of that - communication has been re-established region-wide with Neil's radio tower network idea - so everyone can start getting on the same page. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm there were actually some main plot points in the survey, I'll just also write additional short stories to fill out some of the goings-ons for popular survey choices. For example, a main character might be blindsided by something going on outside the scope of their plotline, but you guys will have seen it coming :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  One of the more interesting parts of Return of the King was the appendix that Tolkien wrote. You may want to look into putting together a supplement of sorts, where you can put information down that may not work in its own story, but can be useful information regarding the multiverse as a whole; a lot of things you put down in your personal notes might be interesting to read, once they're no longer in spoiler territory.

That's a fantastic idea! I just might have to do that.

 That being said, here's a quick question for you: do you ever go to the Forest Wiki and edit anything that might not be accurate, obviously without any spoilers?

So far I've had a hands-off approach to that, but I think lately I've been producing content faster than anyone can update it, so I might have to lend a hand. There are some inaccuracies in there, but I don't often see anything outright wrong. I really enjoy the theories pages, as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We dashed across latticed remains of tarred skyscraper roofing beneath racing domed star-lines. I had never felt such urgency for speed nor had my heart ever threatened to beat out of my chest so forcefully, yet the only breeze was our own, and utter tranquility gripped the world. A canyon between monolithic edifices yawned open ahead, but Guy screamed refusal and ran even faster; he was either rewarded or lucky, for the vines sprouting up around us to the pace of a time-lapse violin now surged, joined, and thickened between the two high man-made ledges. Sweat-drenched, red-faced from angry exertion, and heedless, he sprinted across without hesitation. I had different motivations than he, but I, too, gave more than my all. This mattered.

The whole great span of our screaming lot of monkeys had slowly left this globe to its own writhing natural furies, and there was no one left to care or remember, for it mattered little in the endbut for this one need, this one subject, a heart was at stake. That made it personal. That made it matter.

Tired old mechanisms and slack-jawed tubes rusted and reclined as we passed among them. One of these, still standing tall with the pride of the last soldier on watch, refused to sprout iron oxide and melt like his fellows. Without moving, he approached rapidly, gave us a dull chrome nod, and then receded in the distance, playing us a few low groaning notes to remind us that that corybantic violin was ever on our heels.

A tempest came and went in an instant with the smacking force of a thousand winds, but the momentary chill only refreshed us and urged us across another gap. Soggy but for a heartbeat, we dried as we leapt, and the tower behind us tilted in defeat as our own rose with the shifting of the land underneath. It lifted us higher and forward, aiming to smash us against the titan of glass ahead, but Guy stood his ground, and I braced with him. There had to be trust. There had to be faithor, at the least, there had to be desperation and luck.

The forward edge of our grey stone ledge approached its own image in the cliff of mirrors ahead, meeting to annihilate its twin with a thunderous crash reminiscent of the tempest; we leapt into the interior rooms while the two buildings slowly began to merge by sheer weight. Where once there had been a wide wooden door, there was not even a trace of rot, and Guy climbed the low angle to emerge into the hallway ahead of me while the vines grew in after us and began scouring away what traces of humanity remained.

Daring to spare only an instant to take in the ink imprint the map on the hallway wall had left on plastic, he careened around filthy corners and jumped over fallen metal bedframes and trays. Up the sleek white slope, then left while stumbling between angled wall and floor, and then further up to the room at the end of the hall as the building tilted further; the flickering sky strobed hellacious energy through the far window as we climbed, but I pushed from behind, and Guy fought his way right into that visual chaos. This last barrier he would not abide.

He leaned over the remains of her bed where they had fallen among the debris collecting in the V-shaped bottom of the room between floor and wall. Gabby!

She was pale, wan, and unconscious with that permanent expression of pain on her face, but she was alive. Guy lifted her in his arms as the hospital trembled deeply beneath our shoes. I looked to him, and he looked to methe only way out was obvious, but unappealing. My heart adopted a machine guns fury to match the Violin as we ran up the steeply sloped floor of the room, broke the glass with metal wreckage, and leapt out into the flickering of day and night.

The breeze now was not our own, but that of granted acceleration. As I slid alongside Guy, I held my arm up to block out the mad sky and see ahead; the wall of mirrored windows on this side of the building was still intact, and their framing lines, at first slow visual indicators, began to whip past us at a primally frightening pace. I reached out my arms and legs, but there was nothing to slow our quickening descent. The hospital had been enormously tall, but we were already at a deadly pace, and would reach the ground like three foolish meteors shooting down from the heavens.

Despite his outstretched feet, Guy began to spin. The weight of the unconscious girl in his arms gave him a sideways acceleration that quickly threw him into a tumble, and he lost her to her own rapid slide alongside our course. I pulled Remy out from my pocket in desperation as the horizons rose around us, but Guy screamed over the wind: *No! Shell go back to where her mind is!*

The shadows of other high buildings cloaked us from the strobing sky; we streaked deeper into the darkness. I began to rotate myself; I shouted, So we do nothing?

He kept his gaze on the blazing lines shooting in and under, his eyes terrified, but determined. Yes! Well find a way!

What was I to do? I wasnt about to abandon him now, even as horrific doom grew unstoppably larger in our field of vision. On a whipping spin, I managed to grab the girls wrist, and her weight stabilized my rotation. This was it. There were no more actions to take as the Violin of Times Race caught up to us.

But its own power freed us; the hospital finally gave up the ghost of civilization and collapsed fully onto its side. Glass shattered upwards behind us like so many walls of madly sparkling water, but our tremendous velocity carried us away from the impact until the slight friction of the horizontal windows finally brought us to a gasping stopmere feet from the jagged edge of the buildings roots, now exposed to the elements.

Not stopping to dwell on our luck, he picked her up and jumped down into the rapidly growing jungle. Responding to our weight as they grew, the branches moved beneath us like active footholds, and we ran down spiraling living staircases until we reached the trembling earth. There was nothing left to say: despite all our stamina having been expended just to reach her, we ran with an impossible second wind through the eras after mankinds rule. Streets shifted with changes underground, and we rose; weather ate away at concrete and metal, and we sank; we reached the edge of the city, and we fell. Exhausted, we lay on either side of the girl and tried to still our racing hearts as rapid high notes played my home city into decaying non-existence to the music of time. I managed to stand on weak and shaky legs, but, by then, no trace remained.

Life continued to spring anew around us; bushes sprouted and bloomed, trees arose with the air of respectable gentlemen making illustrious entrances, and dead leaves layered themselves apace around my shoes, threatening to entrap me if I stayed still for too long. Guy staggered up and asked, Where can we put her?

I wanted to find some spark of brilliance and figure out a creative solution, but the pace of the world made it fairly clear humanity was gone and nowhere was safe for an unconscious girl. There might have been a few scattered people left on the globethose that had been incapacitated long-term and with no loved ones to feed them a pill, those too afraid to go with the rest of their species, and those inevitable rare counterculture individuals humanity had once built great inspiration uponbut we would find none of them in time. Go, I told him. You meet Death first. Ill wait here with her. When you get back, Ill take my turn, if you havent already rescued her soul.

Her mind, he countered softly, his gaze on her pained face.

I said, Right, but I hardly meant it.

He clenched a fist and downed enough Remy to vanish promptly. I was left alone among the furiously growing wilds of Earth emptied. I picked her up and began walking, but the direction didnt matter. The world was savage even now, and I would find respite only if I built it.

Finding a careful sparse grove, I direct the limbs of the trees with my hands as I had with my feet in our escape, and I curved them into a solid little house. Denied light, the grasses and bushes within melted away of their own accord, and I used a small raw stone to hew at a large raw stone until it became somewhat like a bed. Protected from the elements, it would not weather away. On this, I laid her down, for nothing living would serve either of us now. It was a rough life, but, at the very least, the blur of night and day had become an even calm glow that suffused everything at once with starlight, moonlight, and sunlight in a combination perfectly pleasing to the senses. If I wanted warmth, I focused on the sunlight; if I wanted cool, I focused on the starlight; if I wanted peace, the moon gave it to me in its own rhythm.

At times, I took small amounts of Remy in order to once again experience dreams in some limited fashion, for I had lost the ability myself. I wandered the shifting valleys, climbed the rising and falling mountains, and bathed in ocean waters blasting forward and back with comical force. I tried to build a sand castle like I had once done in my youth, but the shore melted away under my hands before I could so much as lay a second handful. In so complete a sense, civilization was over. The real world and the dream world had lost all distinction, for the human race had found such a separation no longer useful and discarded it.

It was on one of these Remy-fueled wanderings that I sighted another person. She stood unmoving on the shore until she noticed me and beckoned with amazed need. I approached and focused on the starlight around me; this energy of night strengthened her image. She was one of the dead. I said, I havent seen a spirit in a very long time. I assumed most of them had their unfinished business taken care of in the final days.

She nodded, but a hand brought me closer, and she whispered in my ear.

I smiled. You must have seen me try. I cant build a sand castle.

Her expression fell, as did mine when I realized she was serious.

Alright, I told her. Ill try.

She brightened immediately, and I scooped up sand and dumped it in a pile at my feet.

Torn away by the cycle of tides and surf, it vanished instantly. Laughing awkwardly, I moved further up the beach and tried again.

Blasted by the cycle of winds and weather, it vanished instantly.

Determined now, I ran further, always making sure to stay in sight of her. How long had she been alone? Leaving her there by herself for all time was unthinkable. Carefully, I took the trees and guided them into wide walls. A small hut would not suffice; an era passed while I shaped the entire forests edge and shoreline into a maze of windbreaks that would last a century. Eager now, I slammed one handful of sand downand then another.

She gave a silent sigh of happiness and vanished. She had never really needed a sandcastle; shed just needed to know that she was not alone. Smiling, I sauntered home. It wasnt so much a good deed that gave me lightness, but the assuaging of pain unknowable. This I had never considered in my previous life.

On one knee and weak, Guy awaited me at home. He kneeled over her, watchingand she awoke. He turned to me with haunted features. Whatever he had seen with Death, it had cost him dearly.

I could only ask, Was it worth it?

He gave a slow nod, and I watched the tautness of his pale skin as he spoke. Thank you. We have been partners beyond understandingand friends.

I shook his hand sincerely. For all her weakness and torture now over, she smiled up at me. He took Remy with the last of his strength and gave her the rest of his supply. They both disappeared from sight without so much as a sound.

That was it.

I was done.

There was nothing left.

I wandered outside and watched, in particular, the white beam of the moon circling overhead at blinding speeds. I didnt have to visit with Death. There was no longer anyone to save. How could I risk going through what Guy had gone through? I could see the nightmare he had endured in his eyes. But complete lack of motivation and goal was itself a motivator. There would be no new experiences here. I did not truly have a choice. Forward was the only direction. I took enough Remy and awaited the change.

Death stood in the rear courtyard awaiting me in turn. He had not moved from the position I had last seen him in as far as I could tell, or he had returned to it, or time was less straightforward than I expected in this place. Thus was the nature of dreams, to pick up where they had left off, sometimes even many years later. Here I could directly hear the frantic notes of Times Violin winding down the universe. Was this part of Deaths function?

He spoke, thus: **Your companion braved what is beyond this protective veil of shadow and survived. He lost much, but was already consumed entirely by motivation, and therefore persevered. Will you do the same?**

I had no motivation, but I also had no other direction. No, I told him.

Despite his pure silhouette and pinpoint ruby eyes, I thought I detected a hint of a smile about him. In some way, although Guy had won through and succeeded, my answer had been correct. He raised a hand and summoned a railed ray-traced platform of light from the darkness below; on this, he stepped, and silently bade me follow. Without fear, but with adrenaline-fueled anticipation, I climbed aboard.

Against the rail, we stood at the forefront of the irregular outlined surface; the chunk on which we soared made me wonder if the silhouette-and-ray-traced designs were actually some sort of strange stone or metal. It was chill to the touch, but lacked true coldness the way a void might.

We shot up to the burning blue beam above, and then along it, spearing into the night-cloak that protected Deaths abode. The wind alone threatened to tear me from my perch, but I held on to the rail with all my might; Death himself stood with a slight forward lean, the only indication that he was physically present at all. His ruby eyes remained focused ahead as the shroud lifted.

**Keep your eyes on your hands for the moment,** he said as we rocketed into open skies lit brightly in blue. **This you must know before you look. What writhes here is the Truth; your Truth, as a human being. If you look upon it, you can never take back what you see. Do you understand?**

There had never been a Violin of Time. It had always been my heart playing that insanely paced music with its high notes of urgency and inherent desperate call to immediate action. Time was short. Time had *always been* short. In my chest, my heart pumped madder now than ever before, and I screamed into the wind, I do!

**Then go. Face the Beast, and tell me what you find.**

This was the drop. Our railed rock shook mightily. The world itself trembled as we penetrated the tremendous cyclone wall raging around an unseen core. This was it. This was the Beast that had searched for me when I had dared to have a kernel of hope amidst nightmare. I opened my eyes wide and snapped my head up to take in what had always been hidden from mortal eyes. Gabby had been the first to see it, and then Guy. Now I alone remained to face the Truth.

It had never been a Violin. It had always been a Mobius; one-sided, twisted, in the shape of a violin, yes, but with Times lunatic passions played out against it as high notes that we humans had once heard as seconds; minutes, upon our earlier return, hours, as we had run to the city, days, as we had run for Gabbys hospital, and then years, decades, more, all racing by with hysterical fury as the pitch, lacking minds to hear it, echoed upon itself and heightened exponentially.

And still our pitiful little rock shook in the maw of the hurricane, and Death, displaying the first true emotions I had ever heard from him, shouted: *What do you see?*

Was reality itself shaking? I soared over the hills and valleys and mountains of the infant Earth as it bubbled and shifted and changed. The Moon spun away and cooled; the oceans formed below; the celestial bodies careened around the Sun; that yellow heart grew larger and red, and I shot up through the nebulae and galaxies of existence to watch them spin faster and faster, more frantic now with each passing rapid note. They were clocks. Atoms, molecules, planets, solar systems, galaxies, super clustersthey were all clocks, faster and faster with hands blurring.

The limitless raging cyclone thinned to reveal the eye of the storm, and I tried to turn to Death to ask where the Beast was, but I understood when I could not turn away: I had expected the Beast to be a blue, or perhaps green, creature of monstrous proportions and waving tentacles. I had expected a maw; teeth; a massive void eye searching out hope and annihilating it with all the pains of existence. Torrents battered us, and Death turned his head against the sheer force, sending us around the whorling inside of the cosmic storm beyond all proportions. His emotionhe was keeping us afloat! This meant something to him, and our time here was short.

Faster. Always faster! Time was always shorter than we ever knew; if we knew, it was again shorter than that. My universe of clocks spiraled crazily down into darkness, into nothing at all, each basic particle scattered into eternal night, and then non-existence. But still I rocketed upward, piercing veil after veil. Beneath our shaking pitiful rock countless universes spiraled exactly as their clocks inside; destruction, rebirth, a bubbling sea of struggle, pain, procreation, and futility.

My arms burned as I set my physical body to the task of holding on against the colossal gales as my mental eyes lost all sense of orientation. Up, up, into the worlds of dream, for no existence so vast could be mere rocks and gas ad infinitum. Bubbles upon bubbles; spheres upon spheres; layers through which I spiked at terrifying speeds, trembling with the sheer force of it all the while. Modes of existence red, blue, and every other color and more spanned off to my left, spanned off to my right, and formed an illimitable horizon aheadand still we rose, truly on some sort of rocket for all its painful vibration and my screaming.

And then: calm.

The apex of the spearing flight of Truth had come, and I floated momentarily and eternally at the height of all that was. But I was not alone. In Truth, and in truth, I had never moved at all. In a mind whose size by definition defied definition, whose size would always be bigger than any measure assigned to it, I was a single neuron. Trillions, quadrillions, morewe burned like little stars here in the mind ofwhat?

I could remember them. He could remember me. So many lives across so many eras and existencesnot everyone, not all that had ever lived, but a great number of them. I could feel their memories, their souls, glimmering out there and up close to me in one great big nest of life and cognition beyond understanding; save for that we each, in this mind, shared some common core that made us, in the end, one. We were not the Lovers, nor the Survivor, nor the Pyrrhic Artist, nor the Well-Meaning Hero, nor the Ruthless Parent, nor any other, but we were us, and we were very special to the consciousness at the seat of this mind.

With his cosmic senses, I sensed/remembered others like him all around in vast rows and columns as I understood itall sleeping. In a form of existence larger than any other yet infinitely small, these one trillion male and female giants with skin of cerulean blue slept for hope, slept for peace, slept for understanding. Blood ran down my nose, but I spoke in awe with my jaw and my mouth and the small, oh so small, pieces of muscle and bone that made me: They dream so that we may live

Near the end of his strength, Death forced a shout against the wind: *Which one are you? Does he stir?*

Stir? No, these gendered gods were existence itself, and existence was them. If they ever awoke, this would all end in the same manner as a dream, and they would die. The dream would end. But even in sleep, he was there. I felt him like an aura that permeated my consciousness, that permeated my entire life, for I had always been some infinitesimally small part of this entity beyond comprehension. He wasI amwe werethe Caretaker.

And I could *see*

Death tore us away from the storm of Truth, from the Beast, and silence fell as we slipped back into the protective veil of night around his castle. I had not seen, in my visions, that the rock on which we had flown had been worn to bare foot-sized chunks by the sheer strength of that which we had braved. We stumbled off of it and let it fall forever into darkness, and I sat with Death on opposite sides of the bright blue beam as it crackled overhead on its journey through the massive stone face from which his castle hung. Here we had privacy; here no being would know of what we spoke.

Gasping, Death laughed weakly. **We made it.**

Youre not like I expected, I told him, trying to catch my breath.

**I am your Death,** he countered. **Humanitys Death. I am what you made me.**

I frowned. So there are others?

He nodded his silhouette head weakly, and his ruby eyes closed for a moment. **Many others.**

Then what happens to you when none of us are left?

**Like all things do in time, I, too, fade.** He turned his head to watch the direction from which we had come. **But there were important things to do before I go. Bringing you intrepid few to the Beast was one of them.**

Feeling a little better and sitting up, I asked, For what purpose?

He laughed. **I loved once. Were not allowed to do that**

Allowed?

**Everybody answers to somebody,** he said mysteriously, before continuing. **But in my case, you strange little creatures personified me rather exceptionally. Its hard not to develop emotions when your flock is making artwork of you, putting you in stories as a character, and even including you in movies. Have you ever seen the Seventh Seal?**

I shook my head.

**A pity. I doubt the film still exists on your world now; its been far too long.** Still his gaze remained on the distance.

A notion crept upon me that his fatigue was not entirely from our arduous flight. Are you vanishing even now?

He gave another weak nod. **Youve all moved on to the higher realms; my final gift. I dont hope for a moment that you will be safe there, but at least youre all free of the chains and shackles of reality for what time may be left.**

I stared at him, aghast. Is something bigger wrong?

**Yes. The energy of life bubbles and boils with a strength you wouldnt believe. Others that came before you told me of the Dreamers, these trillion god-entities that dream so that we may exist, and I have spent the tenure of your races existence trying to learn more, for I suspected that one day even infinity would not be enough.** He coughed ruby droplets onto stone, and I tried to reach out to him, but the blue beam between us crackled fiercely at my approach. **One day, whether it be tomorrow or a trillion years from now, lifes conflict and fury will escalate to an intensity so great that I fear the Dreamers will wake. And that will be it.**

I took in this news with a horrified gnawing sensation in my chest. What can we do?

**What did you see?**

Nothing, I I stopped midsentence. I *had* seen more, especially in those final moments of unity. The images came to me with clarity. He told me. The Caretaker told me!

Reclining unmoving against the opposite stone wall, Death listened.

I closed my eyes to focus. He cant know for sure, because hes not them like he is me, but he gave me three images. The Lovers circle opposite around a vast whirlpool of warm red water; they seek each other, but neither can see the other, save for a single message in a bottle that bobs hopefully in the heat. The Ruthless Parent, denied her child, cracks an orb of gold and spills hatred and bitterness into a massive white whirlpool of light. And the Survivor walks across his prison cell in a single step, but it takes all eternity; he arrives enlightened, but a black whirlpool awaits to steal away everything he ever knew.

Death responded after a moment. **I see nothing in my domain that might fit these prophecies.**

Prophecies? I grimaced. No

He waved me to silence. **I should take you now. Im almost gone.**

What are we going to do about those people? Those prophecies? I asked. I had never thought I would once feel sad for Deaths imminent passing, but he had proven to be a person with goals and compassions all his own, just as we had made him to be with our beliefs. I cant go until I find them.

**The Dreamers know not time or space. Those prophecies could occur tomorrow, or a trillion years from now.** He began slumping to the side. **If you stay, I can never come for you. When the dolphins evolve and their Death awakens, he will not come for you. When the beetles attain sentience and their Death awakens, she will not come for you. You will stand alone for all time if you go back.**

As I processed his offer and the fate I would endure, I finally began to understand. I did have a motivation for all this. Despite all the bad things Ive done in my life, in the end, I only found true happiness when I was taking care of others. I looked down at my hands, and a sob came out of my chest of its own accord. And whats more, I am loved. He loves me. The Caretaker knows anything and everything about me, and he loves me. He accepts my flaws, for they are his; he believes in me, for I am his child. Hes not God like our religions believed, but hes close enough for me. I have to believe he showed me those things for a reason.

**Ever the Sisypheans, you people are. I have no doubt it will be one of your kind who will ultimately put all existence in jeopardy, simply because you refuse to be cowed. At the end of the day, that simple Truth is what its really all about. Existence wants you to break and bow down, and you refuse. Beyond all logic, you refuse. Beyond all sanity, you refuse. You are the best kind of crazy.** Death laughed kindly, and then fully slumped to the blue-lit stone. **Ah, humans. Its been** His silhouette faded to grey, and his ruby eyes dimmed. **fun.**

After a quiet minute of silence, I arose with purpose. I had always had purpose, but had only now realized it. My Remy was fading, and I let it go without regret. The world phased back into existence around me, and, without the perpetual fusion of dream and human awareness to fuel it, time had returned to a normal pace. It would be a very long time before the images my patron god-mind had shown me would come to pass, but I was finally at peace. There was no rush.

Others had seen the Truth and been destroyed by the pain of it all. I myself had seen a sliver of the negative side of Truth once before; I was small, I was nothing, and a lifetime of suffering would be visited upon all those who had ever lived and all those who would ever live. Having now seen the whole of the Truth, I had chosen to focus on one thing alone: I was loved, and I would be remembered. What had Guy seen in the Truth? What had Gabby seen that had so incapacitated her? I would never know, but that was alright. If they had made it as high as I had, they would have met other god-minds who would have had other things to show them or let them feel, things that would have been foreign to me.

I wandered into the pure wilderness of Earth with an equally pure spirit. There was one other thing that needed doing in the meantime; in all the billions of years I would have to wait, no one else would do it; not the dolphins, and certainly not the beetles. If there had been one ghost out there, that woman on the shore, then there must have been others. I would walk the newly primal world and find them. Humanitys final cleaning up of the planet would be spiritual rather than physical, and it would free countless souls from an eternity spent standing in place alone. I would find them, and, one by one, I would take care of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is fantastic to hear. I had a ton of fun writing Showman for many reasons, and I'm glad I could satisfy what you wanted to see out of him. I actually found writing his character a kind of fortuitous opportunity, because in a world of big heroes doing huge things, his priorities allowed him to be a real friend for a normal person like Neil. I can't say much more without spoilers for those that happen upon this comment, but it was a great experience - and he's got a few more things to do yet. </TEXT>

Cheng sat brooding.

I cant do this much longer, Dave huffed. Itching his lining-flesh tunic, he spat on the floor of their pustule hut. I hate it here. I cant ever seem to get used to the smell. It changes every time our gracious host eats something new.

Neil clutched the rock they had dragged in to use as a central table. Youve got to hold out. Ive got people I want to see. Im not going to give upyou shouldnt, either.

Its been six months and we havent done anything but watch as the human population here dwindles!

Showman pushed his way in. Speak for yourself. Ive got a quarter of the stomach searched out now. Im gonna find that crystal.

It moves with the tides, Dave repeated for the hundredth time. The acid swings back and forth. Youll never find it.

At least Im doing something other than complaining!

Cheng broke out of his numbness. Stop. Well get through this as long as we stick together. This is hell only if we let it be.

The Salvaged Bell sounded, and they collectively went silent. The time for the voting was nigh yet again. As a unit, they shuffled out into the green haze and toward the scraped town square; it had been bound to happen eventually, but it still came as a shock, and they fought like rabid dogs as dozens of hands grabbed Dave and dragged him away. This sacrifice ceremony they did not attend.

Ill fucking kill Thea, Showman spat as they sat grimly in their pustule that night. Fucking kill her. Throw her in that vortex myself.

Neil shook his head. Thatll just make her a martyr, and solidify herwell, its a religion now, really.

Cheng sat brooding.

---

Merry Christmas, Neil offered glumly, offering his leader a fungus-beer.

Cheng leaned back against the gooey wall of the fungus cleft they had been cultivating for many months now. He said nothing, but accepted the drink. At what point had this nightmare become normal? A year, a year and a halfhow long had they been down here? He was terrified to feel himself beginning to understand the voting system. This was not the worst possible kind of existence. No. That waited below. We have to get out of here soon.

Neil clinked his bone-mug, but said nothing.

---

I got it! Showman whispered with amazed excitement as he rushed into the pustule hut. He opened his acid-notched hand to reveal a crystalline lattice around a small amethyst pyramid.

Cheng stared. You never mentioned it was a suicide device.

Its been modified by someone. Edgar said the Yngtaks, I think.

His skepticism began to fade. Really. He looked between his two men. So which one of us goes?

Showman already had his answer. I think it should be Neil. He has a daughter waiting for him.

Neil took a pained breath. Cheng has a woman and a child somewhere, too.

Dont be a goddamn hero, his friend shot back. Youve already done enough.

His heart heavy, Cheng sighed. I, too, would give my vote to you, Neilbut I cant. Not with Carmen out there, and a baby carrying my family name. We must face that we are at an impasse.

Wait, Neil countered. I might be wearing clothes made out of flesh, eating fungus, and voting for people to be cast into a fate worse than death on the regular, but Im still an engineer, not a savage. I know who should get this teleport crystal.

---

The rumors had been given time to spread. The moment was nigh. All that was needed was to follow through with the supposed escape. Walking up to Thea to shake her hand after another voting session gone well, Cheng smiled from beneath his flesh mask and gripped her fingers just so. In a flash of amethyst light, she vanished.

Behind him, a hundred gasps and shouts rang out. Its true!

Oh my God, shes been lying to us this whole time!

She always had a way out

I voted for my husband. Does that make me a monster?

Cheng slipped away into this sea of people, and it was Showman who stepped forward. Theres only one way out now, mates, he shouted, following their plan. Maybe people didnt make it down below because they went one or two at a time. Guess what? Were all going to get digested eventually. We should go down that vortex together, now, by our choice.

Somewhere else in the crowd, pretending to be an anonymous supporter of the idea, Neil yelled, I say we do it!

Confused murmurs turned to angry and aghast energy over a shattered belief system.

---

Thousands dropped from their boats into the acid sea, all fruitlessly wearing their stomach-lining clothing tied tight. Cheng stood between his men and took a deep breath. Here we go.

This sucks, Neil breathed.

Showman nodded. Just the plain worst.

Together, they jumped.

The torrent of choppy acid was much less dense than water, but was still rough and suffocating. Full of animal fear, Cheng struggled to breathe and process what was happening as the spiraling force began to accelerate. The ropes that connected the three of them remained strong, but there was no chance to shout to one another. All he could see were flashes of terror and pain on his comrades faces. Inside the whirlpool that had always been fated for them, they could finally see the horror belowthe gaping organic intestinal maw that now opened for their offering of biomass. Choirs of screams echoed until the roar of the falls drowned them out, and then crushing forces battered him this way and that.

It happened. His arm shattered. His leg snapped. The pain became overwhelming, and then numbness followed. He was vaguely aware of his spine snapping, and of his fellows suffering the same. An eternity of pain bore down on them, only abating once he found himself more or less smashed bodily into an organic crevice. Completely submerged in acid and strange masses, he prayed for death, but it would not come.

Forward. How to move forward? His only thought in a boiling vat of pain. He had nothing. It had all been taken. Limbs, spine, body broken, acid melting him down. He would never escape from this. It was all he could do to scream and drown in fire over and over untilhe bit at the lining of his prison. Out of anger, out of rage, out of frustration, he bit at his captor, the tiniest of tiniest nothings against a beast of that size.

But he kept biting, with raw exposed jaw and constantly regenerating skull tendons and muscles kept safe from the acid by the press of his own broken mass. When his head became surrounded by intestinal lining, he suddenly envisioned a way out. His skull had been cracked open and flooded with acid, but he didnt need brain matter for this. Out of desperation in this ultimate nightmare, he began chewing his way forward, and his men somehow sensed the idea and followed suit.

As he ate hour after hour, day after day, he became aware of a strange strength, of renewed regeneration. It hit him: this beast came from a reality where size and regeneration were natural. Its flesh held matter from its homeworld, and by consuming it, by regenerating in it

He began tearing forward with raw bones, cutting, slicing, biting, stabbing forward. He could feel the pulse of humanity around him; could feel the others, all of them, thousands of them. Humanity only had one way out of this, and they were taking it with fury and with vengeance. Eternity stretched on, weeks, months, a year or more, it must have been, but its thick outer carapace was the last barrier. They pushed as one, ate as one, tore into it from the inside as one. He could literally feel the energy of his thousands of fellows as they burst through the last, as the titan fell screaming, finally dying from its internal injuries.

For the first time in over a year, he gasped in air; for the first time in two, he breathed in air clean of noxious fumes. The sky was glaring white bone and a sea of red blood tainted by collapsed flesh and black ichor spanned to the horizon, but he was free. They all were. Bursting from the massive corpse, he rose as one among an army of the dead. His bone-stubs whipped muscle and skin and regenerated into hands as he watched; these he clenched into fists as indigenous nightmares converged in the sky and in the sea of blood for a feeding frenzy. At these, he roared with fury and delight, and his shout echoed from the mouths of thousands. So much powerthe bone sky rotated, aware of them in some manner, a monstrous entity beyond belief, but together they pointed up at its celestial eye and roared to shake the world.

We are humanity, and we are no longer afraid, he roared, someone roared, they all roared, no matter. This land is ours now, and you frighteners are but fading spectres. We will eat you from the inside out and make your strength our own. *We* are the new terror.

The world-entity of bone and blood withdrew; it cast them out. Freed like wolves upon the exotic multiverse, they were loosed; undying, unstoppable, hungry for new strengths.

Ahead of them, a lone figure some part of him recognized rode away on a small machine some other part of him also recognized. She was afraid.

But she shouldnt have been. There was no longer any reason to fear. They needed to know this; they *all* needed to know. As one, he and his brethren began running toward home. </TEXT>

He locked the door from the inside and then moved among massive piles of wooden crates to unearth a cubical box about an arms span in length. It was the least interesting container out of the entire assembly, and, for that reason, she knew it was the most important. It was as she had surreptitiously taught himhide in plain sight.

But when he slid the lid away, she understood *why* he was hiding it. The golden glow warmed her face and filled her heart with a gorgeous energy that felt like distilled liquid hope coursing through her veins; the hefty bio-organic orb slowly glowed with the pulse of reality itself. Forcing down extrinsic exultation, she controlled her breathing enough to ask, Where did you get this?

Brace grinned with pride and regret. An old friends greatest theft. He, too, stared down at it. There was no looking away. There were three. One failed. One succeeded. And one

Was stolen, she guessed in wonder.

I was going to say lost, but yeah.

She remembered a phrase whose origin she could not recall. Someone had once said, regarding the history of the Empire, that the Shield, the Branches, and the Amber Worlds had all been grown. They had very specifically used that word: *grown.* The connection to the way the biomechanical works of the Machine Empress had crept throughout this region was suddenly obvious to her. Gisela had designed them, and this. If the Shield and its inner worlds had been grown, then this was a Seed of the same type that had born that golden fruit. This was, quite literally, a seed of hope.

Her companion sighed. Everybodys coming to the table for the peace talks, but theres still one group Ive seen no trace of since the end of the Crushing Fist. I dont know if we can do this without the brownshirts.

Well, her adopted son *had* said he wanted to help. She thought carefully about how best to present fortunes favor. All she could manage was a sheepish half-smile. Yeah, about that

Operator: User, were outside the historical archives. What you are reading was either kept secret or lost over time.

Main: operator can we get a lock on Carmen Faulkner now? Shes got the book with her. Can we see what she used it to read through her memory rather than a direct connection? Scan for anything related to Neil Yadav.

Adjusting primary device vector done.

Operator: User, it appears so.

Drifting in and out of operable consciousness despite his inability to pass out, Cheng Yao slowly became aware that he had died in the fall. Turning his eyes this way and that, he saw familiar faces and crumpled bodies scattered across disgusting living hills of flesh intermixed with seas of acid. Diyu, he gasped, immediately thinking of what he had once seen through a very strange living rift, and of the world where his beloved had been stranded. But this was not another reality. This was worse. Judging by the mottled living sky lit by noxious green phosphorescence, this was the stomach of the titan.

Who was to his left? Learning unliving nerves, he managed to turn his head. Dave.

The large man had somehow survived the fall by landing in the choppy ocean of acid, but was now quietly melting as he lay on green-pink stomach lining. It was only on account of his thick barrier of fat that the acid had not made it to his inner organs. Dave managed to groan, Sir. Im here.

What do you see, soldier?

The other man laughed weakly at that appellation. A few unrecognizable bodies. I see Neil and Showman on the next hill.

Get em.

Dave wheezed an affirmative and began crawling along the slippery surface. Cheng used the time waiting to judge the scope of their deathtrap; the interior was its own terrain and world. The sky was as high as any sky might be, and the hilly flesh had actual horizons that vanished into phosphorescent darkness. Something glimmered like a bouncing little star arcing back and forth from high fleshy ledges in the massive open throat high above. Whatever it was, it fell into the distance. 

It was about that moment that the beast began moving in earnest. Small perturbations had shaken his broken body before, but, without warning, gravity shifted. Space shifted and bubbled, and he knew it was taking them through the massive rift beyond the Waystation. He would have wept, but it changed the circumstances of his separation from his beloved and his child little. A dark icy chill he had felt long ago lurked at the edges of his heart, threatening to numb him until he became lost. Small crystals of ice grew across his vision, chilling his eyes, and he forced himself to have hope at least until the men were gathered and strategies were hashed out. While the emotion-amplifying molecules from the spices in that otherwise unremarkable reality were still part of his makeup, it was dangerous to let despair fester.

But there was no chance to gather the men. Figures in strange fleshy garb flooded the landscape, and strong hands lifted him just as he was regaining his ability to move. Too weak to fight them off, he instead focused on learning whatever he could, and he saw human faces under green-pink masks and heard Indian, English, Russian, and possibly Latin. It occurred to him that the titan had probably eaten thousands or even tens of thousands of exiles on its destructive path away from the Empire. Did this mean hope?

He was thrown unceremoniously down on an area that had been scraped clean of acid traces; the whole plane had been delved and cut so that the acid seas remained absent even when the force of the beasts acceleration pushed the contents of its stomach to significant angles. The masked crowds leapt down to flesh and prostrated themselves as the sky came down abruptly; Cheng felt reality warp and change again, and he knew the beast had just squeezed through a much smaller rift. Space itself here felt subtly electric even inside its stomach, and he fought further despair at the thought that they were leaving behind the familiar realities of humanitys base branch.

Most of the population of the Waystation appeared around him at intervals, each thrown roughly to the squishy ground. Once they were all present, a hard-eyed woman in her forties removed her mask and spoke. Youre all new here, so you should understand how we do things. First, as disgusting as it may seem, you must slice and craft yourselves clothes made of stomach lining, or the acid in the air itself will constantly eat away at you. Second, the great beast must digest biomass regularly. If it hasnt eaten enough from the worlds it rolls through, we vote and send people into the acid vortex until the stomach-sky stops constricting. This is not up for debate. This is what we do lest we all be cast unto hell.

Cheng shook his head at the pains and moral evil people would accept as long as there was something worse to fear; he knew instinctively that he could never vote to send someone further into Diyu. The woman, Thea by name, answered questions and then departed.

Collectively, ability to move returned as their dead muscles and tendons regenerated. Seeking out those he knew would feel the same about the voted sacrifice, he found Neil and Showman already speaking with Dave. He clapped his men on the shoulders, avoiding looking at the open, leaking, or shattered parts of their limbs. Good to see you.

Neil spoke weakly through the pain, but he seemed amazed. I thought wed be done for already.

We might still be, Showman said, his expression concerned. I think we should assume were going to have terrible luck from here on out.

Agreeing with a nod, Cheng studied the massive pustules in the distance that the denizens had carved into humid homes. We also have to assume these people deal with differences in opinion from every new group that ends up down here. Keep your dissent quiet. Blend in. This will take some time.

As hed conjectured, the very first sacrifices that day were people who put up the loudest objections to the voting system. The four men remained silent as the thousands of people in the world of the stomach gathered at the center by bone-canoe and ligament-rafts to cast those protesters into the massive swirling whirlpool that led down into the unhallowed intestines of their host. True to what Thea had claimed, the sky retracted with each new sacrifice of biomass.

Cheng shuddered with hate and horror as the celebrations began. On their canoes and rafts, the flesh-wearing inhabitants shouted joy at another respite won. A day, a weekthey had no way of knowing. They simply rejoiced. Beside him, his men hung their heads and clenched their fists. Many of those cast into the vortex had been parents at the Waystation; their children would never know what had happened to them.

She looked up at the massive bearded man who remained many sizes too big for his chair. She shook her head. I know why youre here, and I wont do it.

Trent trembled. Mom

Cade lifted a hand and spoke quietly. I know what youve been doing with your letters and messages and texts. I know you love us, but I also know youre not the type to sit on the sidelines. Its not in you.

Casey shook her head harder this time. Her eyes began brimming. I love it here. She looked to their guest. Shaw, you promised we would have a new home far away from everything, and that we could live our lives in happy obscurity.

Ward remained stoic, saying nothing. His gaze was compassionate, but hard.

Mom, Trent said again. If you can help, you shouldand I wanna help, too.

No, she replied, shivering with rising unhappiness at the certainty of what was about to happen. This was all for you, at its core, at its heart. You deserve a happy childhood.

Im not a child anymore.

Oh, but you *are.* Dont give up your youth so easily.

I wont. But I also know that we can help. Its what we do, right?

She simultaneously laughed and sobbed. When did you grow up all of a sudden?

Cade took her hand. You wont be alone this time. Not ever again. Lets do this as a family.

She looked to Lara, who sat in her high chair just out of grasping reach of Shaws beard. The huge man still sat unmoving. There was no need for him to say anything at all. His presence here was a symptom, not a cause. Only when the decision had already been wordlessly made did he speak.

When Noah Fulmer approached me that night so long ago and asked me to keep your secret, I didnt know if I could, he stated calmly. I have chosen to move past what you did to me, but I cannot forgive it. I lost my humanity when you sent me into the Shadow Sphere, and then my family with the Brekat when they found out about your control. I had a home with the Zkirax, for a time, but in your absence I followed in your footsteps and made a deal that was necessary for humanitys survival out hereand when they found out, yes, the Death Oath was a beautiful thing, an act of interspecies compassion, but I alone was exiled from the exiles for what I had done. I have lost *everything,* while you have been allowed this time to live in peace with those you love. Im not saying you owe me anything, but it would be nice if we could have you back in the field. After two years of peace, a very precarious time is upon us, and I no longer have any resources with which to struggle.

She let the tears roll down her cheeks. The good times were over, such as they had been. She couldnt help but admit a certain excitement at the idea of getting out there again, this time with her husband and her adopted son at her side. But had she ever really believed she would sit out and fade into obscurity? She couldnt. Even in hiding, even in disguise, even with a new name, she had still taken control of an exodus-wide conspiracy and used it to stay informed.

And something slowly glowed in her heart, like that pulse at the center of the frozen Empire. It had come upon her like a creeping heat over the last two years; most sharply while thinking about the millions of pictures in the Lost Tunnels, and while telling the story of Kumaris father. She remembered him, now that she thought about it. He had asked her, *Is all this really what you wanted when you came out here?*, and she had paused, because it had absolutely not been what she had wanted. She had hoped for isolation, for peace, but starving and beleaguered refugees had begun pouring in, and she had continued to do what she had always doneand something wonderful had grown here because of it.

For so long, everything had been about protecting the ones she loved, but Laura was long gone, and now at peace. If she were to lose her husband or her adopted son or even her own life, that seemed alright now in the face of what was needed. It was themall those people out thereall the Neil Yadavs and Ranis and Kumaris and Showmans and Canteys and Mashburns and even the Graysonsshe was soaring up through the clouds, streaking up through the heavens through layers upon layers of dark storm clouds to emerge into the streaming sun. By her own estimation, Lauras death had taken some vital essence from her and turned her into a hateful cosmic plague on the human race, but now, thanks to the love and peace of so many wonderful people, her humanity had been revived.

Youre wrong, Ward, she finally said, her tears now born of happiness and freedom rather than long-held despair. I do owe you. This house is yours, and the people of Concord are your neighbors.

He raised his bushy eyebrows.

Under one condition, she said, sighing away deep emotions. Take care of Lara while were out.

He nodded toward her adopted son. As I guarded him, so shall I guard her.

Trent high fived him across the table.

But theres one other thing you should know, Ward said, his tone hushed as if someone was listening. I am not here at random. After years of solitude on the open sea, I felt the eyes of the unknown watcher from the future upon me. I sailed back and then ran here as fast as I couldand I was right. The moment you entered the room, I felt it again. Youre being watched.

A chill ran up her spine. Family, weve got our first crisis. Lets go. She grabbed Lara, and, together, the five of them sought out the laptops at the entrance area of the building. Leaning down, she checked the random number generators that they had left running continuously ever since Senator Braces realization that someone had been watching them from the future and attempting to alter the timeline through some form of probability alteration. What do you have?

Trent studied the laptop he had opened. This ones saying it too. The average of the die roll should be three and a half, right?

Yeah. Whats it at? Her numbers were similar: when a roll of one counted as failure and a roll of six meant success as arbitrary conditions, the average represented the generalized probability field, or so she had hoped.

For the last several hours its dipped to two. He stepped back. Now its one point nine.

Luck has turned against us, she whispered, her thoughts grasping for some nearly coherent revelation. In the distance, they began to hear a commotion. Running to the torch-lit main road as a group, they were quickly privy to the big news. The Waystation was reporting the first return of human beings from the next base branch they had ever seen; Carmen Faulkner of Vanguard fame had arrived exhausted and at the end of her strength with a baby boy on her back, and, an hour after her appearance, now hundreds of men and women were emerging from the rift and making their way across that final valley.

Ward Shaw had sensed it first, but Casey could feel it in her soul: the book was back.

She watched the celebrating farmers both alive and dead by the dancing light of the torches. It was her own Doctrine, really, that said humanity must survive by carefully balancing cosmic destructive forces against one another. By the stories the refugees traded, she herself had become such a mythical force, and perhaps that meant they all had a chance against what was coming. She also guessed that the book itself was nothing but a tool, but that tool was undeniably gwellion in nature, and the presence of a gwellion somehow always meant very bad things. If the herald is back, then an equal force must rise to meet what is coming, she murmured.

Cade squeezed her hand. Go.

She could already see her target. Pushing through the crowd, she greeted Senator Brace with an open palm instead of the knife she had intended when he had suggested capturing and torturing her parents. Edgar.

He was always visibly happy to see his mentor. Yes?

She pulled him away from the commotion. We need to talk about this plan to go after Cristina Thompsons parents.

He moved close to the wooden wall of the Forum and looked around to make sure nobody was nearby in the dark night. I feel pretty shit about it, too, but the stakes are too high. We need everyones cooperation. Kendrick messaged and said he promises hell get Her Glory to show up, but we need the Grey Riders, too.

Holding back her initial plan to confess, Casey studied her mentees face. What is it? What have you been secretly working on all this time?

You could tell? He seemed surprised at her perception, but not altogether so.

Yes.

He studied the nearby crowd to gauge their attention, took her by the wrist, and led her quickly between the maze of fresh wooden buildings that had only grown more complex in recent days. Remaining furtive without coming off as abnormal to anyone who might happen by, Brace removed a padlock from an unassuming but sturdily built storage barn and slipped inside. Intrigued, but not alarmed, she followed.

One of the Oather senators called out, Oh yeah? What development?

I cant say yet. Just give me one more month.

Grumbles rounded the floor, but a vote was cast, and the Senator was given another month of men and resources to investigate the supposed conspiracyCasey gritted her teeth while wearing a smile of success. These people had no reason to believe him on this topic; shed seen to that. It was only because of the peace talk effort that he still had the slight majority in his favor.

Thank you, Brace continued. Weve also gotten word back from the Grey Ridersthe Grey Leader has finally agreed to attend the peace summit.

Amazed murmurs spread through the senators, and Casey couldnt help but narrow her eyes in confused wonder. Hed managed to pull that off all by himself, and without her knowing about it. How?

Brace looked each of his fellows in the eyes over the course of his speech. Theres no guarantee of a treaty, just attendance. I bear full responsibility for forcing this matteryou all know Ive long held the theory that our famed angel and demon Cristina Thompson is the Grey Leader. We have no idea what the Grey Riders want, but I do believe that Thompson has personal desires beyond their crusade. Her goal is also their weakness. You see, I figured it out. Two years ago, they went around capturing some of the Vanguard finders. Not all of them, mind you; just the ones that knew people that had used amethyst suicide devices. My squadmate Clint Alvarez was one of these finders. My working theory is that Thompson believes the amethyst zygotes do not actually kill a person, they merely send the user on some sort of unspecified teleport. Another squadmate, Bill Nash, used one of these devices. Later, just before he was captured, Alvarez told me he sensed that Nash was still alive and very far away. If youve read your Fulmer histories, you know that Thompsons husband, Conn, used an amethyst suicide device before the end of the Crushing Fist. I believe she wants the finders to lead her to the same place their squadmates went so that she can locate her husband. Thus, the entire Grey Rider movement may be a power play on her part to control the necessary resources. I think theyre being played for fools.

An older woman, one of the Oathers, shook her head. Thats a mighty convoluted theory.

Brace did not smile. Two days ago, I sent a message to the Grey Riders. I said: attend the peace summit, and I will get the finders to help you. I received an affirmative response within the hour.

After two years of silence?

Yes.

An uproar of questions followed, but he just shook his head. Speaking loudly to be heard, he said, If we want a true treaty, we need to go a step further.

Casey glanced to the others around her as wary silence fell. Her fingers slid inside a careful slitted hem in her dress to grasp the handle of her knife directly. This plans existence outside of her purview put her on an edge as sharp as that of her knife.

He continued with fierceness. The fact that this play worked at all means our valiant Vanguard finders have not yet cracked. Theyve been held prisoner for a long time now, likely tortured, and I consider that playing dirty. I would like to propose an initiative to track down and census surviving First Worlders.

It was the Speaker himself who asked the question this time. For what purpose?

Brace took a deep breath and proposed something he visibly knew was just as dirty as the torture of his comrades. We find Cristina Thompsons parents and we hold them hostage.

At that, the Forum burst into veritable hysterics. It was just logical enough to sound sensible and just repugnant enough to remain divisive. Staff and senators alike began pushing at one another as the yelling reached a peak, and Casey slowly drew her knife out into the open air and held it by her thigh where nobody would see it. Brace began moving to exit the hall as the Speaker shouted to clear the area; this was her chance.

But visions of the previous night overwhelmed her senses, and she saw her own dyed red hair floating in a cloud before her as her husband whirled her around to an eighties song brimming with hope, fire, and energy. Hed said that shed always made a business of shooting at the walls of heartache; that she *was* the warrior, and shed laughed uncontrollably for a good thirty seconds. Goddamnit. The knife returned to its hidden sheath unused.

Thus had the network of conspirators remained inactive for two yearsat first she had told herself that the time wasnt right. Then, there had been a litany of important excuses. Now, all she could think about was the tremendous pain that her excessive paranoia would visit upon what humanity had built. Every day, texts revolved through her mirror-men to inform her of the movings and goings on of the entire region, and, every day, she obsessively calculatedand did nothing.

The moon had been split in half. Shed had this nightmare weekly. She *felt it* all over again, that shift in gravity, the absolute terror of a celestial body falling to impact the Earthand she had resolved to *never* let what had happened to her world happen ever again. The deaths of the Ghost Council and their subsequent invisible power vacuum had merely been a good opportunity to stay informed and retain control. Now, it had taken on a life of its own, undermining the happiness she had finally found out here with her family.

But before the waiting crowded mass could exit the hall in orderly fashion, people began pushing back in. Unsure what was happening, she returned to her seat and watched as a half-dozen charred black men walked slowly onto the main speaking platform. They were minus a few thousand members, but the expedition back to the Empire had finally returned.

She understood by watching their lead man that their skins had not been blackened by fire, but by frostbite. They looked like snow-worn corpses that someone had dried out and then operated by invisible strings. They were bone and lean-muscle puppets with eerily alive eyes.

No one in the Forum spoke. There was nothing to ask, for the question was obvious. The lead man rasped a bit and then waved over an Oather, who repeated his whispered words. We nearly managed to reach the old border of the Shield, but thats as far as we could go. Even dead, there was no getting closer. The cold was so severe that many of us froze solid and are stuck there still.

What temperatures? the Speaker asked.

The Oather repeated the corpse-whispers: Our equipment stopped working at a hundred below zero. That measurement was taken somewhere in northern Florida.

Casey shivered at the thought. Others gulped.

The Speaker shook his head in despair. Who would have thought we exiles would survive while our homeland perished? So the First Tribe has been wiped out

Not necessarily, came the response. Theres an eerie silence out there. All bands. Radio, quantum transceiver, scanners of all types; they all show nothing, save somethingone thing. The Oather repeating these words frowned and asked for confirmation. A single signal. A spark at the heart of the old Empire. It slowly glows.

She usually spoke out sparingly during these meetings, but this was exceptional. Intrigued, Casey suggested, A warning, maybe? The Senators all turned their heads to look at her in surprise. Like the one we left outside the Jade Orb.

It might be, the expedition leader replied by proxy, his healthy eyes on her. But it has a sound. A pulse. Its hard to describe, but it felt hopeful. He turned away. But we did find enough information while we were there to figure out whats happening. The base vacuum energies of realities close to the void left by the Devastation are draining into the darkness, much like a large ice cube chilling soup. When the Amber Worlds were ejected, inter-reality dust was gathered into numerous large balls rather than being allowed to float freely. That solution saved us temporarily, but left the void empty and with a vast energy differential. This is what my men and I have fought home to tell you: the cold is as unnatural as it feels, and it will not end any time soon.

Stunned, the Speaker let the frostbitten men leave of their own accord and with dazed thanks for their service.

Casey felt as cold as those men. Standing and slipping out a side door while absolute chaos erupted behind her, she floated home. Doors opened and closed; she sat. Her family was already at the table.

Cade seemed apologetic. Honey, we have a guest.

	<TEXT> Freed by the sudden change in terrain and carrying the aftermath of numerous flattened valleys, warm spruce-scented breezes eddied around Edgars sleeves. One arm held the book under bent elbow, while the other held the soon-to-be mother of his child. Neil Yadav and Showman had been more than members of that sea of faces that now seemed to comprise humanity in exodus, but what could be done for them? He knew that they could not die. What fate awaited those cast into the maw of that continental beast? To melt half-alive in stomach acid forever, or to be ground to a pulp daily in an intestinal tract, or perhaps to be caught in one of its lungs as an angry but futile carcinogen for all timethese were pains his lower animal brain forced him to shy away from out of innate horror.

He stood under the sun with Mona and stared out at that massive tattered rift that now fluttered crazily on the horizon in the wake of the Unstoppables exit; survivors began emerging from crevices and caves or under lifeless tentacles Her Glory had sliced away in her battle with the beast. He had once heard reports of her transmorphic spheres fighting with a monster of that same description, and he wondered if she had known of it or had prior conflicts with that species. Finally looking away from the prismatic glimmering horizon, he shared a glance of horrified awe with Mona, and then looked up toward where Her Glory had soared down like a falling star.

Motions were made, tasks were delegated, and order was restored, but Edgar helped with these moments in a daze until strong scarred arms surrounded him and held him fast. Kendrick was covered in the dark viscous blood of the grasping tentacles he had torn off in self-defense, but it didnt matter.

Edgar stayed in that comfortable shadow cast by what felt like a giant. Jesus Christ, he breathed, trying to get a grip. We shot at that thing from the back the whole way here. There was nothing anyone could do. I thought that with logic and ingenuity, we could beat anything, but even Her Glory failed. And Mona almost

But she didnt, Kendrick murmured, holding him for just a moment longer. Youre alive, buddy. Sos she. There was motion, and then a hopeful addition. Pixley!

They turned to see the battered blonde slogging through bloody black mud. Wheres Randy? she asked weakly. It wanted everybody, but it couldnt get them all, not with Gisela flying around pissing it off. Wheres Randy?

The caves, I think, Mona responded. The women and children went down there to hide. Wheres Cheng?

The four of them gazed out over the rock, flesh, and blood wreckage, but no other survivors had come in for nearly half an hour. There was little doubt he had been taken.

Pixley sat roughly down, uncaring, on a twitching pile of muscle. Theres so few of us left

Kendrick looked to battered walls of piled rock and broken wood. At least the Waystation survived, mostly. I never realized I cared about those damn boulders until I thought He left his sentiment unfinished.

White flashes crackled and shouts echoed from the cliffs above. Before any of them could work up the energy to go investigate, three women dashed dangerously down the narrow steps in the rock face. One of them reported, The Machine Empress is up there!

Many glances were shared, but it was Edgar whom the burden of handling this fell upon. Shes alive?

The women nodded. One rubbed her own dirty face and sighed. Shes not letting anyone near her.

Looks like shes hurt, the third finished. Wistfully, she added, And maybe a bit scared.

Edgar began thinking through plans to approach or contact the eight-century-old woman in the cliffs safely, but Mona pushed that aside with a confident grip on her captains arm. Kendrick.

Surprised, the large man turned. Me?

Yeah. You. You were right there with her, in her shield, and chose not to hurt her. Out of everyone here, youre the only one of us that she would recognizeand hopefully trust.

Kendrick gulped, but agreed wordlessly. He followed the three women back toward the stone stairs while fruitlessly trying to wipe some of the gore from his tattered clothes. Pixley staggered up, too, but her anxious steps took her into the Waystation and toward the caves.

I should go help the wounded, Mona said, biting her lip. Even if they cant die, we can still save them a great deal of pain.

Edgar let slip her hand. I understand.

He stood alone at the top of the downward curve into the endless valley that held the horizon rift to the next base branch. The breeze no longer felt warm; rather, the heat of bodies, of flesh, of spilled blood. Why had Neil done that? Why had Neil Yadav given up his escape to a woman he had hardly known except for her connection to his friend? Her pregnancy notwithstanding, for Neil had his own child to worry about.

With that, Edgar felt his stunned pain finally crack in favor of action. Kumari! He ran as fast as his shaky legs would allow. There was no longer any thought for the helplessness of humanity in the face of the multiverse, and for this, he was thankful.

The battlefield remained once he had goneempty, steaming under the sun, and dim.

Those hiding in the caves were hesitant to emerge, but fires were lit under the evening sky between the Waystations damaged walls and the cliff face as little choice remained but to gather somberly and try to recover from what had happened.

Edgar found great relief at seeing Kumari alive, even if she was perpetually crying, but there was no hugging or familiarity, for he had never met this Rani that was not the right Rani. She had heard his name from Neil and so let him linger near for a time, but then took the baby back to the caves to spare others the loud crying.

He watched with equal relief as Pixley emerged minutes later with Randy in tow. Randys normally fiery hair was muted with dust, and her gaze was distant and haunted. Neither had much to say, and both sat quietly by a fire nearby watching nothing but the mood-inappropriate dancing of the cheery flames.

Nobody was present to mourn Cheng properly. Edgars heart felt stabbed through by the notion that so many people had died on this flight from the First World Empire that whole families and cultures had no one to miss them or mourn them, for those that might do so had also been wiped out. There would forever be hundreds of millions, maybe more, whose existence nobody would ever remember. He looked down at the book in his hands.

There was one way. In that moment, he understood completely the motives of men like Noah Fulmer. Researching and writing down the history of the human race gave their struggles meaning, no matter their eventual success or failure. It also informed those that came afterhow many times had they won through based on knowledge from those stories? And now he himself was one, if the spread of the Week of Hell myth was any indication. Why did people listen and follow him? Neil and Showman had been part of his group, but had met horrible ends. Would others follow him simply because they had heard his name before? It was certainly why Ward Shaw had even given him this book in the first place, and started him on a new mission. Could it really be that inane? Was name recognition a kind of power?

His mind struggled with two realizations too massive to hold in his thoughts all at once: first, that yes, name recognition was a kind of power that he should be using; second, that something*something***something!**what was it? It was almost there, almost a complete idea, almost a major piece of the puzzleif name recognition was power, yet the Grey Riders chose to hide their namesin this case reversed, that meantsimply knowing who they were would give away why they fought

He had been down this mental road many times before, but he resolved not to give up until he had it. He had absolutely no faith that the Grey Riders were leaving the peoples of the exodus alone simply out of the kindness of their hearts.

Someone offered him a wooden mug of home-brewed beer, and he accepted with thanks. Raising it to Cheng, Neil, and Showman in nightmares distant, he drank sadly.

Night was full and deep by the time he awoke under its cloak of silence and privacy. Kendrick shook his arm again and nodded over by the dim light of the fires smoldering ashes. Edgar shot up, but remained quiet at his friends unspoken insistence. Wrapped in a blanket and warily looking around at the hundreds of scattered sleepers, the Machine Empress of Mankind took a hesitant seat on the low boulder next to his. Kendrick took up post on her other side, guarding her without the appearance of guarding her.

At a loss for words in two waysfor this was a monstrous myth and a living legend out of time sitting before him like any random late-twenties woman, and because she was excruciatingly gorgeous up close, alive, and by orange cinderlighthe opened his mouth and stammered out a weak greeting. In a flash, he was back in high school all over again, and all his journeys and confidence left him until he forced himself to internalize the fact that *this was not a girl.* He gulped, turned his face away, and whispered to himself, Come on, otaku, get your shit together. This is a reality bender!

That snapped him back into his video-game sensibilities, and he turned to face their gazes. Im glad you decided to trust us. She looked at him blankly, and he remembered with some embarrassment that she didnt even speak his language. Did that make his initial greeting more or less awkward? He chose to believe less. But how could they talk? The only way he knew to translate

He pulled out the book from wherever it went when he wasnt paying attention to it, intent on trading it back and forth to read one another, but she gasped excitedly, reached out, and took it from him. He stared at his empty hands; wasnt it supposed to be impossible to take the book unless it was purposely given?

Her eyes went wide with appreciation and glee, and she turned the book this way and that, studying every corner while speaking rapidly in what he assumed was Old High German. In that excitement he recognized himself, and he relaxed as he understood that in her own special and immortal way she, too, was an otaku. She threw many bouncing and happy phrases to both him and Kendrick, but she was too enthusiastic to notice they couldnt understand her. Without warning, she reached her hands straight down into the book itself, and Edgar reeled as his brain struggled to comprehend what was happening. The space around the book warped, curved, and pulsed grossly; he looked away as the urge to vomit nearly got him.

She stopped of her own accord, with an expression of admiration and understanding. To Kendrick, she shook the book, and to Edgar, she said a word he didnt understand. Finally noticing the disconnect, she reached down and grabbed a smoldering ash from the fire; burning herself, she threw it away in shock, rubbed her fingers, and then reached for two stones at their feet instead. One was a pebble, and this she placed on top of the closed book. The other was a fist-sized rock, and she held this one in her unburned hand, her fingers spread around its rough curves.

She tapped the book and pointed at the pebble.

Edgar nodded, intrigued.

She tapped the book and shook the fist-sized rock at him.

Its bigger than it looks, Edgar said with mirrored excitement, holding his left index finger and thumb a tiny bit apart and his right index finger and thumb very far apart.

She nodded happily, but then threw the fist-sized rock away. She tapped the book, pointed at the pebblelooked around for some new objectand then pointed up.

Edgar looked to his friend, and they both followed the vector of her finger to a sliver of silver moon high above. It took a moment for that comparison to sink in. Thats big!

She shook her head. Waving her finger, she metaphorically drew the moon down to the pebble, tapped the book again, and then drew an arc back up to the sliver in the sky.

The pebble is to the moon as the moon is to the pebble is to the moon againdo you mean exponentially bigger? Taken aback, Edgar gaped. Do you mean to say that the book is *that much bigger than it looks?* That would beJesus Christ

Kendrick stared. How big?

I dont know, Edgar responded, aghast at the math. Like a half billion solar systems in diameter or something?

Our solar system?

Yeah.

Whoah. Thats pretty big right?

Straining his brain and doing his best, with the caveat that his assumptions and results might be completely wrong, Edgar finally spit out, About five times the size of our galaxy?

Kendrick scooted back a few inches on his stone seat. That book *right there* is that big?

Their blonde cohort in cross-language communication grinned. Mihhil. She threw her arms out wide and opened her eyes as far as they would go. **Mihhil.**

They had no other choice but to laugh in amazement. It might have been the strong local beer, but Edgar found himself relaxing. Talking quietly in the late hours of the night like this, he saw Her Glory as just a big ol nerd who loved machines and liked to invent things in her basement; it just so happened that her basement was a wide region of parallel realities, and her toys were physics-bending creations of insane proportions. What hobby, he asked himself, wouldnt get out of hand after eight hundred years alone?

She spoke aloud; reading the book, he saw her intent in English. She had said, Where did you get this beautiful device?

He gave her the book, and it translated his response for her. We dont know. Its been lurking around the Empire for eight hundred years, around the era of the Shields creation, since He paused. Actually, since He hesitated, thinking of her years spent obsessively trying to cure her comatose husband. You were indisposed at that time.

I understand. She studied the stars above. That era feels to me as another life might. I have been reborn in more ways than one now, and I must decide what to do with this new chance. Were that I had my teacher and mentor; I have many questions.

Edgar watched the realization cross his captains face. Kendrick leaned forward. We know where Verene is. Shes with one of ours, Carmen Faulkner. Can you retrieve them both, and anyone else surviving alongside them?

How hadnt he thought of that? Edgar reeled as his friend began drawing a map of the region for their companion. In some ways, he knew, he had written Carmen off as dead or gone foreverjust like Cheng, Bill, Lian, and Clint. Holding onto hope had been too painful, and the multiverse too big. The squad had been cut in half by losses, and those open wounds would have bled out his heart if they had been left unclosed. Lacking clear closure, the only choice had been not to talk about it.

But Kendrick was back. No longer torturing himself for the decisions he had made, he was talking and feeling again and finally doing something other than building those damn walls as self-imposed penitence; at this, Edgar smiled. Even now, he could not allow himself to hope for Carmens rescue, but he could be happy for his friend.

Their blonde companion stood and dropped her blanket. Edgar blushed all over again, but she turned out to be fairly completely bandaged for all her wounds. He tried not to look at the red-stained white as she focused her remaining strength on assembling something from the scraps of metal lying all around. A broken laptop found its way into the components, though being too weak at the moment, all her engineering was done by hand. Edgar assisted by quietly waking Randy to help, but that was all he could really do other than watch.

Randy took the surprise well, if with wide eyes, but all social graces faded as the two girls dove into the work and began speaking in a completely different language that the book offered no help in deciphering for him or Kendrick. The two men sat, drank beer, and watched the work until the suns glow tinted the sky and the exhausted redhead and blonde lay their device on bare stone, activated it, and ran away.

Sparks shot out in every direction, reality rippled dangerouslyand a long violet rectangle about half Edgars height and twice the length of his spread arms opened out on the testing area. It was low and narrow, but it was functional, and they clustered on their hands and knees by the portal and gazed in upon a world of randomly-vectored acid waterfalls and floating mountains. The two engineers played with a few components, and the other side changed abruptly to a new location. This they did five more times before they honed in on their targets.

No time for pleasantries! Kendrick shouted. Get the hell in here!

Dawn threw a blanket of sudden brightness and warmth over them as gaunt faces both strange and familiar clambered through on all fours. Carmen was one of the first Vanguard members to emerge, and she took the rescue in stride. She seemed older somehow, and tired, but righteously calm. I always knew youd find a way. I was never worried. Despite her obvious hunger, she clasped each of them in her strong embrace, and Edgar found himself clutched hard for the second time. His senses almost didnt believe it; this woman had been part of his family lost, and she was *back.* Her dark hair and light brown skin and confident voicehe recognized all of these innately, remembered her strength, and her secret pains, her two daughters lost to tragedy. Of that pain, she showed none. She faltered only when she learned that Cheng had just been present the day before and was now caught in a fate worse than death.

Verene was the last, and Gisela stood waiting with her blue eyes full of hopebut when her mentor finally emerged, it was with ivory skin and hair, the same as always, and the bandaged blonde clutched a hand to her own heart. Why arent you alive?

Why *are* you? Verene responded, her tone cool and emotionless. The men and women that were trapped with me were unable to die. Has the same condition befallen you?

Edgar looked on as their esteemed guest began conversing with Verene in Old High German. Closing the book out of respect, he waited a short distance away with the others. He greeted Mona warmly upon her arrival, and then many surprisingly girlish screams were had between she, Randy, and Carmen reunitedbut this amazement soon turned to grim discussion.

Maybe ten minutes later, Carmen approached him with intent. He could already guess what she wanted. He asked, Youre going after Cheng, arent you?

Her fists closed at her hips. People cant die, so I know for sure hes alive. Im not going to let the father of my son suffer that way.

Its a boy?

I can feel it. She looked to the rift-torn horizon. And Verene could tell with a scan somehow. Her half-hearted smile faded into stoicism. Im going to take a bike and ride after him, just like we did before.

Edgar regarded the book in his hands again. Nobody who has gone to the next base branch has ever come back.

It doesnt matter, she replied, breathing back unspoken pain. If I dont see you again, know that youre family to me. Always. If we cant get back, Cheng and I will forge a life out there, somewhere, with whoever else has gone that way.

Still feeling the animal shock and terror of utter helplessness against that monstrous beast, he shook his head. You cant. You wont win.

It doesnt matter, she said again. She glanced back to the others. Im not letting any of you come with me. Its obvious youve become important hereand I know this is a one-way trip.

Hating that he was secretly relieved at not having to face that evil again, he nodded. You know what? He gazed past her, at Mona. The last time I purposely made a tactical mistake and let something important go for a good cause, for the benefit of a friend, I got something much greater in return. A pebble bounced from somewhere and hit his leg, but he ignored it. Holding his hands forward, he said, You should take this.

What is it? She swatted away an errant butterfly fluttering around her face.

Its the most powerful information tool in existence, he told her, his heart lifting. You can use this to track the beast, to learn about threats ahead, and to see how Cheng is doing if youre close enough. A single drop of rain hit his forehead, and he wiped it away without faltering.

Giving this to me does sound like a mistake, Carmen said, determined. But if you offer me this, Im not going to refuse. Only do it if youre sure.

Ignoring another random pebble, this time against his arm, Edgar thrust the book into her hands. Im sure. Youll bring it back soon enough, so its no problem.

Her confidence held a hidden hint of sadness. Yeah, Ill bring it back soon. She closed her eyes for the span of a few seconds. Theres no time to waste. Tell Jennifer Im sorry I missed seeing her. Book in hand, Carmen began running toward the bank of vehicles that the surviving residents of the Waystation had retrieved and cleaned up after the prior days attack.

This time, the pebble hit him right in the eye. What the *fu* Edgar stopped short, hand over his face, as the events he had read in the book about Showmans doomed ride came back to him in a flash. He drew up tall. You voyeur son of a bitch. He looked around, but there was nothing to see; not that there would have been. The unknown watcher, whoever it was, had to be somewhere in the future based on the changes Showman had seenwell, the changes he had seen in the energies beyond death, as strange as that sounded. You were trying to stop me from giving her the book, werent you? He laughed loudly. Well you can go to hell!

He watched from that same high point over the last valley as that lone figure rode out toward the shattered horizon. Go Carmen. He shouted: *Go Carmen!* One of their squad had finally been rescued. Hope was possible. Hope *was* possible. Save them all! He ran a few steps down the rocky slope before slowing. I know you will. Bring them back. I owe one of those men, and I intend to repay.

The entire horizon bubbled, crystallized, and vibrated as that lone rider vanished into the chaotic ether. Edgar narrowed his eyes at some final thought. Hadnt there been issues with the book traveling through certain types of rifts before? It made sense, if it really was five galaxies in diameter. All that size and machinery had to be bundled up in numerous higher dimensions, with energies unbelievable and

Doriana staggered forward, her arms held close despite the resistance of seven layers of clothing. It was so cold. Why was it always so cold? Perhaps it was the weight of loneliness. She was beginning to accept the fact that they had all chosen poorly by traveling past the void canyon in the multiverse rather than away from it, but she had not yet come to internalize the other fact that she was literally the only survivor in this entire hemisphere of the exodus. The Gath Ice-Computer had shown her the truth of her situation, indeed begged her to stay with it, but she could never have loved it the way it wanted. With the rise of this eternal winter, it would be fine. It didnt know it didnt need her.

Walking. Just keep walking. The cold had to end sometime, didnt it? She couldnt really be the only human survivor in this entire direction from the ruins of the Empire. What hope would there be in that? Just keep walking

Casey turned away from the door and faced her laptop-equipped volunteers. Well, girls, thats the seventh morning in a row with no new arrivals. She gazed out of the main buildings front window and sighed. Like they always said, if you havent made it by now, you never will. The exodus is over.

Should we keep things open one more day? one of the girls asked, her lip trembling. My brothers family is surely still on his way. Theyre just taking a long time to get this far, thats all.

None of the others said anything, although they turned their faces down toward their laptops with quiet unease.

Sure, Casey said, her tone compassionate. One more day couldnt hurt.

Her only response was a thankful nod. The girl knew the truth.

Loss and pain were an omnipresent part of the mix these days, an unavoidable consequence of such a massive shifting of peoples and populations, but Casey looked out upon troubled waters from a high tower of peace and centered happiness. Moving on through the now-gargantuan farmhouse-turned-major-complex, she found her classroom and waited as the hundred or so small children swarmed in at the behest of their parents just before starting time. She smiled at each one of their eager faces.

At nap time, they wanted to start the story of the New Exodus Vanguard yet again, but she did not relent. One of the mothers had been asking for quite some time for her to read a specific story from the litany of tales the Exodus had produced as its own culture of suffering, loss, triumph, and family; she had balked away from telling this one for the sake of the mans daughter. Kumari was nearly three now, and she wouldnt quite understandbut there was so much good in the bad. Sooner or later, someone would connect the story Senator Brace had told about his friend to this little girl in her class, and, sooner or later, someone might hurt her with it. Rani had asked for this, hoping that Kumari would take it better if she already knew the story years before the impact became personal, and, on this, Casey had relented.

The children had already been read a few parts, but last time she had gotten caught in a strange feeling she didnt want to think aboutfor some reason the millions of pictures theyd had in the Lost Tunnels of the Zkirax reality that day reminded her of long-ago pains.

She was glad that these children were too young to understand politics. The older classes under other teachers always seemed to get in big arguments when the subject of the Zkirax came up, for the Death Oathers were quite the divisive topic. She could still remember the hectic day that a runner had come and told them everyone in those tunnels had died; that runner had been correct, but also wrong. The billions living in those tunnels had learned of the deal made with their fleshand then they had learned that the Zkirax had resolved not to go through with it, instead intending to die out as a species rather than commit genocide. For that honorable choice, every man, woman, and child in those tunnels had killed themselves with a stone spike to the back of the neckand then remained dead to simultaneously require no food and to help regrow the insects depleted reserves. It had been a valiant choice, and brave in ways so utterly human, but the Oather movement had taken on a life of its own in the two years since

She shrugged off dark thoughts and quietly closed her book as the last of the children dozed. They adored these stories, for what kid wouldnt love fairytales that were *real?* But they were still kids, with all that being young entailed, and they were thus easily distracted. She got out basic math books and prepared for the subjects that would come after nap time.

The hours passed full of youthful exuberance, screaming, and random crying. Despite the chaos, she couldnt help but sigh with satisfaction. This was the best job in the world.

As they always did, the parents came much too soon. Freed from her roles as Concord caretaker and schoolhouse teacher, she readied herself for her third and final role of the day: the monthly Senate meeting. She did not hold any political office herself, but, as owner and operator of the largest farm in the entire region, she was almost always asked to be present. She never refused.

First, though, there was a stop for dinner in the core of the farmhouse where nobody else was ever allowed to tread. This was her familys private space, and therefore her hearts sanctuary. Trent was in from his engineering class and eating a large hunk of snow-wheat bread; she ruffled his hair, and he complained, Mom! Stop! Im not a kid anymore!

She just smiled. He was coming into his own as a young man, sure, but she reserved the right to muss his hair whenever she felt like it. Grabbing a few plates from dark cherry cabinets her husband had carved by hand, she set out food and went about cleaning some dishes from the night before. An empty vat of wine from the newest vineyards lay tilted in the sink; she hoped Trent hadnt seen it.

Cade entered with a tired sigh of success after a days labor in the fields; he slung baby Lara from his back and set her up in a high chair. It was chilly out early, but it got warmer.

Colds not moving, Casey shot back. Because were not. It doesnt dare come any closer.

Lets hope. He handed his toddler daughter a chunk of bread and bits of cheese, which she gladly shoved in her mouth before asking for *more.* Is that your favorite word, Lara? he asked. More?

She bounced in her chair, sending her blonde hair leaping. More! 

Casey laughed and joined her husband at the table. He immediately moved close with warmththe community dance the night before had been fantastic, and he was still in a good mood. The DJ had managed to play all her favorite eighties songs, and the two of them had felt young again; not that they were old, really. It was a good life.

It was good.

It was all shed ever wanted.

Yeah. It was.

She cleaned up dinner and headed to a back room, where she slid her cellphone out of her pocket and began texting decisions that shed made the night before. Senator Pixley didnt know her identity, of course, but the woman had long been one of her best operativesat least once shed quit drinking. Pixley *got it* in a way many of her network did not. After that, Casey lifted the hem of her dress and slid on a hidden belt and small knife.

On her way back through the house, Cade grabbed her and swept her around. I swear, the Yadav tower network was the worst idea weve ever had. Now youre glued to your phone all day!

She put on a smile and said, Oh, just telling the girls what a great time we had last night.

Sure did, he said with a grin. You *are* the warrior.

Trent groaned. Come on, Dad!

Fine, fine.

Taking leave from her heart, Casey used the length of the evening walk to the Senate Forum to craft the proper persona. To the representatives, she had to be a sensible former farm girl now a woman with surprise structural responsibility. To the people around her on the walk, she was a personable groundskeeper whose word was law; she waved and smiled at neighbors and laborers she regarded as little more than behavioral and social objects. Senator Brace was already speaking by the time she slipped into the massive wooden auditorium. She took a seat directly behind him and to his left, two seats down from where Wygant, the Surgeon General, was bouncing her two-year-old on her knee and keeping the little boy quiet and happy.

We cant stop the investigation, Brace continued loudly. Were close to cracking the conspiracy. I can *feel it.*

Across the hall, Pixley stood among her supporters. Edgar, you know Im behind you no matter what, but we voted collectively to stop putting resources into that because we havent found more than a handful of crackpots in two years of looking into it.

Brace stared at her.

Casey had long wondered why the man had never sought to expose her. Was it a question of familial bond? Hed directly read about Showman seeking her out that day at the Waystation, but he had never told anyone but his mentor that part.

I know the Ghost Council is real, he finally continued. I *know* it is. And I know they could start a coup at any time and throw everything weve done into upheaval.

An older senator from one of the smaller and distant farms shouted, You know because you read it in some magic book. Yeah, we know.

A magic book which he conveniently sent off to nowhere, someone else yelled.

She knew she had to play her role in a forward manner. Hey! Casey said, standing. Have some respect.

Shouts and jeers crossed the auditorium in both directions. At the front, the Speaker slammed his gavel. Calm down.

The yelling only grew louder.

Shut the hell up! Senator Brace still has the floor!

Casey took her seat along with everyone else. The man to her left and the woman to her right, both Braces staff, silently thanked her for her support with glances.

Its different now. Theres been a new development, Brace said rather firmly.

Instinctively, Casey let her hand slide down near the knife under her dress. Her seat had never been chosen at random. This was where she preferred both herself and her agents to bejust behind important figures, invisible to history, ready to both whisper helpful advice and stab someone in the back.

	<TEXT>  This isn't an issue, is it? Us readers often forget you too are only human.

There's a big maze of life and business issues I navigate invisibly as far as these stories are concerned, mostly the choices for what I spend my time on. I largely have to focus on publishing and business work, because these stories pay very little so far. These stories and their associated books are on a very long growth curve that I know will eventually be my 100% primary thing, but for now it's definitely tough to get motivated to post weekly stories for free. I feel justified and I feel the story was worth it when people comment, engage, and get inspired to think and imagine. That's actually the primary drive of my personality - this type of science fiction and speculative discussion is incredibly rewarding.

And I know you guys are the seed for a community, too. From even before the original CreepyPasta forums, I have seen multiple major horror and science fiction communities emerge and fade, and now I fear NoSleep is beginning the downward curve of its lifespan. We may be one of the next tribes that have to carry on. </TEXT>

One thing I knew to be true at a fundamental level: for any unforgivable sin, there would be three temptations. I am not a Biblical man, but I do know human beings. We have limited willpower and limited conscience. Give a random man or woman a chance to screw someone else over for their own gain and its likely theyll actually refusethe first time or two. Its only after theyve been conditioned by the results of those choices that they see that there is no reward for being good, the structure they are imprisoned with doesnt care about them at all, and there is no punishment around the corner. I knew there would be three temptations; I didnt realize Id already been through the first.

What we had been doing before had been justified in some sense of the word; violence is not an inherently evil thing in many philosophies, and we had actually, against all odds, made the world a better place because our actions were rare in a stagnant culture of rampant excess and deliberate unaccountability. Even that last night of mass murder hadnt really been our fault; had gotten beyond our control; had been fated to happen one way or another, with or without us, evil intent or not. I couldnt stop thinking about the twelve year old daughter who had come home to find a property full of bodies. I wanted to have children someday. What would I tell them? All secrets come out in time, especially to family. This guilt was my first temptation in reversea window on what was to come, a signpost before taking the ramp onto the highway of horror, and a warning about the unhappy rewards I might reapand I resolved to regain control and end our murderous crusade any way I could.

But backing out of a murder pact is no simple thing. At any time, any of the group might incriminate the others if backed into a corner, and if any of us were implicated, we all were. In the same manner that we scoped out our victims to increase and maintain our control of the situation, what I needed was information. I began tailing Jake in my off hours.

If he was hiding something, he was remarkably cool about it. In the interim before our next official meeting, I watched him go to his job at the factory, work all day, and then sit around at home all night drinking beers. He ate little and went to the gym only occasionally, for his job kept him wiry and fit. It was his innate strength that gave him his imposing aura and confidence. I wondered if there was some method of taking that away during our inevitable conflict.

Numerous skills were needed. Over several weeks, I acquired pieces and machinery to construct a home brewery in my basement. I watched every video, read every guide, and experimented throughout every free hour. What I needed was a beer that tasted similar to Jakes usual brand, but with higher alcohol and calorie content. I tried different amounts of various sugars while following recipes found online. Certain sugars could also alter the color and body of the beer without affecting the flavor profile, but too high a sugar content led to something more akin to cider. I didnt have time to master it, but I could produce something close enough. After that, I bought dozens of bottles of his brand with cash, dumped them out, filled them with my high-calorie and high-alcohol home brew, and then used a careful series of tools to re-cap them as accurately as possible.

I had doubts about my homebrew beer passing the taste test, but I finally decided to risk it as my time until the next meeting began to run out. Jake had a pretty consistent pattern when buying his groceries. He went inside with the perishables, which gave me a chance to dart over to his open trunk and swap out his beers for mine.

Waiting and watching that first night, I shook with a thrill and a power I hadnt felt since getting away with our first murder. There was every chance Jake would notice. I was terrified. I was caught. But thenI thought about my own experiences with beer. When it tasted off, I didnt assume someone had replaced it with the intent to fatten me up and give me worse hangovers. I just assumed it was a bad batch, or maybe the recipe had changed since Id last had that beer. And, on top of all that, Jake didnt seem to drink because he enjoyed the flavor.

He did make a confused rolling motion with his tongue as I watched through the window, but his first sip slid into his second and third without further incident. In two hours, he slumped on his couch and passed out to some unknown bright movie on his television screen.

It had worked.

I felt high on electricity the rest of that nightuntil the flaws in Jakes unwitting perspective spoke to my own sense of paranoia. If I could follow him and replace some basic thing in his life like that without him guessing, could the same be happening to me? I kept my eyes sharp while acting otherwise normal. I pretended to do spring cleaning in order to investigate every nook and cranny of my living space. I found nothing, but an idea I had seen in my research possessed me. In the darkness of my home, hours after I had pretended to fall asleep, I slid noiselessly along the floor like an inch-worm and crept my way out behind my place until I managed to crawl under my car without being visible from any outside angle. In complete blackness, I gently touched every inch of the underside of my car. It still held latent heat from the days drive, but I slid my hands and fingers within rough metallic spaces unseen, obsessively mapping the lay of the mechanical landscape above

My fingers met something small, smooth, and plastic, and I knew.

The cops? The FBI? The NSA? If it had been any one of those agencies, we were doomed merely by suspicion, and they probably would have picked us up long ago. It hadnt been Jake. Id been watching him, yes, but he was also a man of physical threat rather than deception.

Tom.

Motherfucking Tom.

The snake in the grass, playing the meek member hardly willing to do what was neededbut hed killed that girl upstairs in that house all on his own. Hed cried after that, but tears could be faked. I couldnt afford to take anything at face value anymore. And if hed been tracking my car, he would know Id been observing Jake. If he knew that and hadnt said anything, then he had a hidden agenda to match my own. Was he tracking Jake, too? Tom might have been tracking us out of self-preservation, but that was another assumption I wasnt about to make. I left the tracker in place to avoid tipping off that I knew.

The night of the meeting came. We met at a restaurant in a hotel by the airport, for we had realized that oftentimes crowds were safer than being alone. The restaurant served a hundred new guests every single day. We would not be remembered.

Tom chose the last, Jake muttered with a gruff expression under bloodshot eyes. My undermining efforts were working. And that turned to shit. I got a better target in mind. He turned his gaze directly against mine. The one coming down hard on your department. The Vice President of your company. The hired gun that goes from company to company gutting things for profit.

Something was off. I looked between my partners in crime. Why would you use your pick on someone I would love to see gone? Why not use it for someone you want dead?

I got my reasons. I dont have to explain myself. Jake took a swig of his beer. Huh. This tastes like shit today.

A compliment to my advancing home brewing skills, I supposed. Alright then. I looked to Tom, but he was playing the same meek and worried role as always. Had Tom given Jake this idea somehow? It was uncharacteristically devious of our most physically imposing member. Whats the plan?

We were killing as a team now, no sitting out, but I felt safe enough by having never met or spoken to the Vice President of my company directly. I was many layers of management down, and knew nothing about him initially save for second hand rumors. If the police somehow considered me a suspect, I would just be one of thousands at my level and distance from the victim. They couldntand wouldntinvestigate us all.

This was my second temptation, and it was one which I was beginning to fail. I considered making a move before the night of the planned assassination, but the gnawing pain of seeing my men being worked harder and paid less every day kept me subtly delayed. This was my department, and we had been doing a great job. If they had just left us alone, we would have continued succeeding without suffering, but it was almost as if the corporate structure innately desired our pain. There was not enough attention or understanding from anyone higher up; there was no one below us to take part of our burden. There was only profit, and the seeking of it, and we were less than nothing in the face of that.

My soul hovered between light and darkness. What we were doing was wrong; I knew this, and had been moving to end it. This delay to accommodate a self-serving murder was wrong; I knew this, and delayed to allow it. While I hovered on the fence, we scouted, observed, and recorded. It took three months to pin down every single facet of Heartless Profiteers rather busy schedule, but we managed it come the holidayor, I should say, *his* holiday. According to his most recent change, announced 4 PM on Thursday, us peons would not be getting the Friday off for the long weekend.

Oh. *Oh.* You fucker. I felt bad about it before. I really did. But you fuck with a mans long weekend, and you deserve nothing but acid and pain. Some things in this indentured world are still sacred.

I worked through that Friday with a light heart, knowing his comeuppance would follow soon. I told my men not to worry, and that I was sure corporate would change its mind eventually. Saturday morning, Tom, Jake, and I headed up to the lake in question. A policeman actually pulled us over on one of the back roads and we thought to call it off save for his grin at seeing our fishing gear. Tom had suggested it, and I had acted as if I was surprised at his cleverness. The cop didnt check our licenseswhich would have ended everything merely by the involvement of our namesand he talked fish and game with Jake for a good five minutes before waving us on toward a damn fine Saturday. We thanked him kindly and drove out all smiles.

Surprised at my own surprise at Jakes calm showing, I realized my continued undermining of his health was rearing its ugly head as dangerous instability that had made my opinion of his abilities change. Jake was red-eyed at times and often unkempt now; that day, he actually still seemed drunk from the night before! And he popped a beerone of mineas we approached the lake.

Toms eyes held more calculation and apprehension than I had ever given him credit for. Is that wise?

Jake grunted. We gotta look like were on vacation in case anyone sees us, right?

Nobody will see us.

Yeah, and we wont beat a whole house of people to death, either.

Toms expression sharpened ever so subtly, but he climbed out of the car without another word. He was still playing the bullied one. I could see now that Jake thought he himself was in charge, and that I had also thought that this entire time. I resolved to scrutinize our groups interactions even deeper, if I could. Something was very wrong here.

The lake held a lively scattering of jet skis, pontoon boats, and swimmers, but it was no matter. The span of the beautiful natural bay was such that every massive cottage on its forested shores was virtually completely private. We couldnt hear anything but the distant whines of boat engines, and they certainly wouldnt hear a scream on the off chance we screwed up our surprise attack.

One of the rear doors to the palatial cottage was unlocked, for this was the middle of nowhere and surrounded by other rich people. Crime was unthinkable. Crime would never happen *here.* I could see those thoughts on Heartless Profiteers face as we quietly surrounded him in the kitchen. There was no need for stealth or immediate death. He was alone, and doomed.

He understood immediately. His lanky form held tension, even fear, but not weakness. How much?

Under his ski mask, Tom said, A million.

Our white-haired and age-lined victim looked down at his bare chest and swim trunks. I dont have it on me, but done.

Tom spoke again. Ten million.

I think Heartless Profiteer suspected, in that moment, that we would not be swayed by money. Still, he negotiated. I dont have ten mill in cash. I only have four. Youll have to make do with that much.

No, Jake cut in, laughing. I know what youre doing. *Six million.*

The older man gazed around at the three of us, gauging the tightness of our triangle, the viciousness of our weapons, and the chrome strength of our resolve. Five.

Jake raised his brandished lead pipe. Hah! I fucking knew it! Hes probably sitting on a hundred million and thinks were idiots. Bargaining for his life with pocket change.

I chimed in for the first time with my concern, which had now grown greater than my need to disguise my voice in case our victim somehow got away and sparked an investigation on all of the companys employees. Focus up. This is not what were here for.

Heartless Profiteer turned his gaze to me. I sensed you gentlemen might not be swayed by money. Youve done well in cornering me here alone, but our time to negotiate is short. Perhaps theres something else youd like. He nodded toward a picture on the kitchen counter.

Tom looked to me and Jake with alarmed eyes set in black fabric. How had we not caught this?

The old man grinned. My wife and I dont spend much time together, on account of her being a gold digging whore, but I certainly knew that when I married her. She does what I say, if you catch my meaning. Thats our deal.

Jake took a deep and slow breath. Thats

It was. Heartless Profiteer was married toI couldnt believe it. Of all the goddamn women in the world it could have been, we had stumbled into the cottage of Recognizable Gorgeous Actress.

I could already see what was about to happen. Dont get distracted.

Jake let out an alcohol-heavy huff. Dude, we could fuck Recognizable Gorgeous Actress.

Tom shook his head. Its too risky. Itll turn into a mess. He carefully did not say *another* so as not to inform our captive that we had done this before.

How long? Jake asked.

Heartless Profiteer checked his watch. Its water-proof, he commented with a smirk, referring to his wearing a watch with swim trunks. But shell be here in fifteen minutes.

I knew Jake was thinking that he could take this prize and then we would just kill Heartless Profiteer anyway, but he was drunk and likely not thinking about the secondary consequences. First, there was DNA evidence from that kind of activity that would get us caught; second, we would have to kill her too if the situation went even slightly wrong; third, the death of Gorgeous Recognizable Actress would be a national goddamn sensation. We had never been investigated yet, and this would surely blow up in our faces.

And what were the chances that we had walked into a cottage like this? As the scope of my sensibilities expanded, I realized: a hundred percent. We were targeting the wealthy and the powerful. They would *all* have assets such as she; and if not a trophy wife, then some other luxury or opportunity equally unimaginable. We were showing ourselves as small time fools by being swayed by this.

But I felt a sparking hatred as I thought about the fact that every single cottage on this bay housed rich old men boating with their families and banging women so beautiful that their mere existence in the physical world was a myth and a fantasy to men like us. Lonely men; solitary men. We worked to the bone each day in order to one day be worthy of average women. Lovely people, sure, capable of emotion and intellect and inner beauty as much as any quality person, but that level of oozing sexuality that magazines and television shows and movies bombarded our brains with had always been denied us. She was a myth and a goddess to us, but a toy to this man, and *all the men on this lake were like him.* Beauty like that was just another resource they had monopolized.

Even as I saw another way out of this, I itched to kill him.

Heartless Profiteer laughed. Oh man, you guys play your part too well. I really thought you were going to kill me! He moved over and sat down on a stool with relief. This is creative even for her.

Tom, Jake, and I shared glances of confusion.

He narrowed his eyes uncomfortably and spoke mainly to Tom. Im fine with being in the room, but theres no male on male contact, alright?

He thought we were sent by her to *role play.* That was our way out. I could navigate this situation so that nobody would have to die. There were too many risks and just enough reward to avert this murder

but God did I hate him. My soul wavered back and forth.

Finally I said, Damn. You have to pretend like were real home invaders when she gets here, or itll be ruined since you figured it out. Yeah, good, I told myself. Play to his ego.

He held up his hands and put on an expression of mock horror. Oh no! Im so fearful.

The next quarter hour held the most awkward fifteen minutes of my entire life. Heartless Profiteer poured us each some whiskey and we sat around *with our ski masks on* and talked weather, politics, and sports according to each of our highly strained random thoughts. Profiteer himself downed shot after shot, and I began to get the idea that he was working up resolve for a situation he only pretended to enjoy so as to keep his much younger wife. At that, I shook with restrained anger. I didnt want to see humanity in this man.

Oh, shit. He ruthlessly pursued money to keep her; to *remain worthy in her eyes,* at least for continued marriage. I hated him, but I also hated that I was beginning to understand him.

Tom kept an eye on our whiskey glasses. They would not be left behind for evidence.

The fancy red Lamborghini pulling up in the driveway elicited a collective sigh of relief from all of us, and we stared through high glass windows as a vision of blonde and breasts and butt emerged in exactly the way movies always portrayed it. My God, that moment is seared into my memories.

Up! he said, and we jumped back into our murderous triangle.

She screamed the moment she walked in, but her stance relaxed in hidden ways as Heartless Profiteer said, Oh no, theyre going to kill me unless I let them sleep with you!

She really was a fantastic actress. After that brief moment of confusion, she snapped back into the role of terrified victim perfectly. Tom and I stood back and watched as Jake took point. I had no idea what Tom was feeling, but I became increasingly unsettled by what sounded and looked exactly like a violent rape. On some layer it was, by deception, but I dont think Jake had even analyzed it that far. This was real to him, and she was doing a perfect play at making her end seem real, too.

Its no defense for our crimes, but her real world presence and attractiveness really did hold a sexual aura that had never graced our lives before. The heat, adrenaline, and testosterone I felt in those moments watching that were beyond anything Id ever felt. Normal women simply could not evoke those feelings so sharply and powerfully; in a way, that was the raw power of women like Recognizable Gorgeous Actress, in the same way that vicious wealth was Heartless Profiteers strength. Both of these people were made gods in comparison; he by standing out against a vast strata of poor men, and she by rising above a sea of normal women. She was just as much a problem in our world as he.

I didnt care anymore. I didnt participate, but I didnt stop Jake as he grew rougher and rougher. She urged him on until he was practically beating her half to death, but she never stopped. Despite it all, she was still in control of him, and of us, and I so despised being controlled. We were fools, and Heartless Profiteer would squeeze every bit of life from me and my departments men in order to prop up this womans altar.

Having grown increasingly uncomfortableor perhaps insecurewith the treatment of his wife, he chose that moment to speak up. You know, I dont think

My weapon found his neck and slashed halfway into it. He fell to the floor, dead before impact. Blood sprayed all over the kitchen and up my clothes and mask, but I just breathed heavily and let the hate flow out of me. I had the presence of mind to grunt, Stop that shit, Jake. You look like an animal.

She didnt scream. She just watched and sighed as Jake climbed up naked and confronted me. We would probably have had a fight there and then if she hadnt said, Oh, you *idiots*. Get out of here. Ill handle this. She checked his body and then began wiping up blood.

We stared.

She frowned. What? Hell go on vacation more or less permanently, Ill control the money, there wont be a peep in the media. Its win-win. With rosy cheeks and full lips, she flashed us a smile. What, you think I actually liked this jerkoff?

Tom and Jake stood behind me, now freed from the captivation of the Dream of being in her presence. I had freed us. For the moment, I was our leader. I held my knife to her alluring throat and ignored her nudity, for that way lay madness. Youre an actress. Youre acting.

Theres nothing I can say to convince you, is there? she asked calmly. No sob story, no promise, no plan.

I shook my head. Youre too skilled.

Id failed my second temptation, but I was not truly lost until that third and final test: leadership.

Tom had found us. It had always been his idea; he was the sociopath, not Jake. He had manipulated us from the very start, letting us tighten our own nooses while offering necessary manipulation, but now that was over. He and Jake had shared a moment of weakness and nearly allowed us to fail. Tom knew that, and wordlessly promised to follow me as long as I followed his initial objective.

He and I had created a monster together in Jake. The man was a red-eyed and violent drunk that had no idea we had both run secret agendas against him. If he found out, he would kill us. If he didnt find out, he would move further down the path he had tasted today. This was a man who had felt the evil of sexual violation, and, judging by the way he had taken to the power of murder, he was going to need to be reined in by a strong leader who used willpower rather than deception.

These men needed someone to lead them, for they were more dangerous unbridled than not. A murderous sociopath and a violent abuser without focus, without causefor as I saw then, our crusades righteous cause had always come from me. I was a wellspring source of my kinds latent fury at wrongdoings unjust and immoral, and that fury needed direction. It was fitting that, in the rotation, it was now my turn to choose the next target.

My first act as leader was to not kill Recognizable Gorgeous Actress. There were many complications to such an act, and she stood to benefit immensely by the death of her husband, something she had been secretly hoping for anyway. I let her stand. Put on some goddamn clothes. And dont wear makeup around us. No more masks. That goes for all of us.

All of us? she asked. She began to wipe away her makeup and reveal her bruises, but she had already taken her mask offin more ways than oneby revealing the true darkness of her nature.

Tom slipped off his ski mask and breathed deep of air purified by lungs held by fellows who finally knew what he was, for he might have had a different brain and different emotions, but he was still driven by the need for companionship like any other human being. He now had it, with my blessing.

Jake slipped off his ski mask and looked at his hands; flexed them, tested his strength, and looked to the gorgeous naked woman in our midst as some sort of idol for that which he desired to take from this world. He would be given it, within my imposed limits.

I removed my mask with the feeling of ascending from dark waters and bursting forth into the light. Im David. An average name for an average man; for that is what we werenobodies, fighting for all our fellow nobodies. This is why I write; to confess, and to inform. We are fighting with you, and for you. 

I kept my eyes locked on her dazzling blue irises to pull out the truth of her intent. I could still hear boat engines in the distance, on this bay populated exclusively by the wealthy and powerful. Now tell me how do you feel about your neighbors?

She grinnedsincerely.

I approached wide windows and looked out upon nature the way the rich saw it. From high on the hill, luxurious grass ran down to a clean shore and a vast glimmering domain of opportunity. Unsuspecting little ants moved about on the water and on the sands, oblivious to what awaited them. Then lets begin.

	<TEXT>  I must say, I love all of your stories. Having to choose favorites is difficult. But now that I have to choose, I'm gonna say my favorites are the ones that emphasize the size and scale of the many different threats, and the utter danger and chaos of it all. I also love the way you describe the gigantic threats, most recently the Titan. Imagining these things play out in my mind is unbelievable. Keep up the good work.

---

It's amazing how easy it is to commit murder once you know what you're doing. All you have to do is think about it from the perspective of those at the scene. They'll ask: who might have done this? Their list will include friends, family, coworkers, anyone who happened to be around at the time, and anyone who was both on a national database and who left evidence behind. Getting away with murder is as simple as not falling into any of those categories.

Our plan was straightforward enough. We each scheduled two events on the same Saturday night with four hours in between. We picked a target who was two hours awayand we went way over the speed limit on roads we'd checked out in the weeks beforehand for police activity. It was fine to speed on the way there because we hadn't done anything wrong yet, although the drive back would not have the same luxury. The thinking here was that we would have alibis with a four hour gap, and no cop or jury would believe that we had somehow gotten a hundred miles away, killed a complete stranger, returned without being noticed, and resumed hanging out with friends like nothing had happened *all in under four hours*. Even by our carefully prepared plan, it would be tight. Every facet had been crafted down to the secondand all of this would only be necessary if they somehow realized they should investigate us.

The man in question was not *the* CEO that had begun the drug price hike craze, but he was certainly on the bandwagon. None of us personally knew anyone whose medicine had gone from $1.25 to $800 a pill overnight, and that was why he had been a suitable choice. He was a good distance away but still within range while also being completely unrelated to our lives. I think we whipped ourselves into a frenzy over this price hike thing as a way to justify what we were doing; looking back, if I really have to be honest with myself, I really just wanted to re-experience that power. At work I was a beleaguered manager desperately trying to maintain the promise of a fulfilling work place while sociopaths above pressured for more. Here in my secret other self, men like that could simply be removed directly in a manner most satisfying.

We blazed through the night at a hundred and ten miles an hour. Dark trees and a cloudy sky hid our beat-up old anonymous car, and we spoke little on the drive. We were all too focused on our own anticipation.

A bit of payphone social engineering had paid off greatly hereImmoral Gouger had forgotten to switch over his housing security system when his old credit card for bills had expired and his new one had come in the mail. He didn't know it, but his alarms were all offline. His wife would also not be home for quite some time, as we'd made a stop on the way and slashed one of her tires. With a racing pulse and gloved hands, I crept out of the back woods and carefully removed one of the panes from the rear door of the house. Reaching in, I turned the lock and let the three of us inside.

We slipped into the darkened dining room to listen and assess the situation. It sounded like Immoral Gouger was watching television in the living room, but it was important for us to get the jump. We had to be sure. For over twenty minutes, we listened, waiting for him to make a sound. I wondered if I had ever sat at home and watched television while oblivious to a murderer a room over a giggle sounded upstairs, and we looked at each other in alarm. Someone else was in the house.

We moved back toward the door intent on escaping, but a half-dressed brunette in her twenties stared at us in shock as we rounded the corner into the kitchen.

We froze.

She had a low and round glass of liquor in her hand, and she nearly dropped itTom raised a hand, and she reflexively caught it before it fell. The look on her face was that of absolute terror; what else was she supposed to feel when three masked men suddenly had her cornered?

"*I'm just a working girl,*" she whispered, shaking mightily. "*He's upstairs. Please. I'll just go.*"

Tom looked to Jake. Jake looked to me. I looked to herand nodded.

Barefoot and crying silently, she ran right out the back door.

Before we had a chance to discuss what to do, we heard Gouger call down, "Brunette Working Girl, what's taking so long?" He ran down the stairs with enthusiasm, appeared before us in a flowing purple robe, and fell as Tom clocked him with a pipe. At the top of the stairs, Blonde Working Girl shrieked and ran down the upper hallway. Jake cursed and charged up after her, but I stopped him halfway with a grunt.

"It's done," I hissed. "Let's go."

"She's gonna call the cops!"

Tom backed me up. "Don't worry. We'll be out of here before then."

We covered his head with the tarp we'd brought and each of us hit him with our weapons until his skull had been reduced to mush. That was that: leave the tarp and run, for it had been bought with cash from a major chain and never been touched by any of us. We'd even shaved our heads, worn shower caps for much of our preparations, and donned long clothing despite the summer heat. No hair, no skin cells, no bloodthat was the plan.

We were well on our way out of his property when a gunshot rang out. We turned to see headlight beams in Immoral Gouger's driveway; his wife had taken an Uber home. Her early arrival had allowed her path to intersect with Brunette Working Girl, who at that moment lay bleeding from a shot to the right shoulder.

Finally-cracked Wife screamed again and stalked closer down the driveway with her gun ready for another go. "I fucking knew it! *I fucking knew it!*"

Our careful plan had become an utter mess. There was no telling what the cops would think now. A man had been bludgeoned to death in his home while his wife had just shot one of two working girls out front. The blonde one would claim three men had entered the home; the brunette would be dead in short order. Would investigators think we had been hired by the wife? Maybe it'd be wrapped up neat and tidy better than any of us had expected.

Except I couldn't help myself. Of the three of us, I alone knew the responsibility of stewardship over good people. Brunette Working Girl wasn't one of my men back at the job, but we *had* let her go, and she *hadn't* given us away. She was on our side now.

My pipe found Finally-cracked Wife's head almost of its own accord. I was shouting, too, but I can't remember what. All I remember is barely getting there in time to save Brunette Working Girl from another and much closer gunshot. She lay curled on the pavement crying and holding herself against the pain; I walked toward her with concern as Jake slipped out of the bushes and crumpled her skull.

He looked to Tom. "Go get the blonde. This shit's out of control. No witnesses."

"The hell?" Tom protested. "How many people are we killing here?"

While I looked on in shock, Jake barked, "The wife was going to kill them all anyway. We walked in on a mass murder in progress!"

Rather traumatized but still operating with desperate logic, Tom nodded and ran inside.

I couldn't breathe. "You just"

Jake wrapped both Brunette Working Girl's and Finally-cracked Wife's hands around his blood-soaked weapon and then carefully began arranging the scene to look like the wife had bludgeoned and shot all of them while taking a lethal blow to the head in the process.

We realized we'd made yet another mistake when the horrified Uber driver began pulling away.

With startling swiftness, Jake took Wife's gun, aimed with the manner of a practiced huntsman, and let fly. The car rolled a bit and crashed against a tree; snapped out of my own state of numbness, I ran over there and checked on him. He'd taken the bullet in the back of the head and died instantly. His cellphone was still on hold with 911, and I carefully pressed the *end call* button with my gloved thumb.

Tom returned from upstairs with haunted body language. "It's done."

"Did she call anyone?" Jake asked, his eyes full of fire.

He shook his head. "Her phone was dead, and she didn't know where the landline was upstairs."

"Good. It's all set then."

Returning to stand with them, I disagreed. "To make the murder spree of passion story work, we have to take the tarp. Finally-cracked Wife wouldn't have used that. That means we have to drive back two hours with a blood-and-brain soaked tarp in our trunk and then find some way to dispose of it without anybody noticing. Not to mention our plan to kill one immoral bastard just got five people killed!"

Jake moved closer and got more aggressive. "With that woman on a shooting rampage, wouldn't they have died anyway?"

I hated to admit it, but"Yeah."

"Then we didn't really do jack shit." He stalked inside and returned with the rolled up tarp.

The drive back was as silent as the drive up, but for vastly different reasons. I simply couldn't process what had happened. I'd been an innocent boy once. I'd had my cheeks pinched by my grandmother and I'd played with my cousins at family reunions. Could my aunts and uncles have ever guessed that I would one day be part of a mass murder? We should have stopped with the three we'd gotten away with. This was insane.

A State Highway Patrol car rode up behind usand then got over and passed at high speed. None of us dared move a muscle.

I rolled down the window. The night was quiet, warm, and expansive. I needed the world to be larger than just me at that moment, and it was. Existence was more enormous than I could ever comprehend, and we were all just specks. That's what I had to tell myself: those people had been specks. Brunette Working Girl might not have made it anyway; one gunshot could cause an infection if not properly treated, and I doubted she had health insurance.

Yeah. She might have already been dying when Jake

"I'm done," Tom said unprompted, his eyes misty. "I can't do this anymore."

Jake turned to look at him. "You nuts? This was your choice of target. We do it in rounds of three, right?"

"I can't. I just can't."

"What, so we kill your target and then you bounce?"

Tom cried harder, but said nothing further.

I didn't speak. I was acutely aware of the evidence in the trunk. I planned to make sure I was around for the disposal of every single piecethe tarp, our masks, our gloves, our very clothing. It was time I started taking my partners in crime seriously as their own kind of threat, because I had the suspicion Jake had been thinking that way all along.

It was only when we got homeand after I faked my way through my second event with friends that nightthat the real impact of what we had done became clear. Local news had mention of the *apparent crime of passion*, so, sure, they'd bought our setup for the moment, but somehow we'd completely missed the fact that Immoral Gouger had a twelve-year-old daughter away at boarding school. She'd come back from abroad and found them the very next morning.

	<TEXT> I opened the glove compartment to grab and swallow a couple relaxants and then, after a moments consideration, followed it with a gulp of week-old coffee from my middle cupholderthe last thing I wanted to do was fall asleep. My phone began to ring in anticipation of delivery of a similar sentiment; my partner had been a few steps away in the dream world, but, that many layers deep, distance equivalents had become almost random. It had taken me the better part of an hour to hike back to my car. There was no guessing where he had ended up.

That was him! Guy shouted. That was Death!

He couldnt see it, but I nodded weakly. I know. And I also know theyre going to think its highly suspicious that we took our emergency caffeine pills and bailed the moment we saw him.

Well play it off like we just panicked for a moment, Porter.

I mean, we *did*wait, you arent planning to go back, are you?

Im not stopping until I find Gabby.

This was a prime example of the problem with partnering with amateurs. The jigs up, Guy. Were not going to bullshit our way past Death himself.

He wouldnt or couldnt hear me. You can hang back if you want, but I have to do this.


Youve got your own supply of Remy, right? I sighed as he answered in the affirmative. Then I wish you luck.

If thats the way its gotta be, he said. Then thanks. I couldnt have gotten this far without your help.

Sure. I replaced his voice with a gnawing sense of failure and guilt.

And that was that. My larger-than-life quest was over. The real world was my home again, and I had to get used to mosquito bites, exhaustion, and unrelenting sameness. I scratched the bumps above my ankle where bugs had gotten in during my walk back through the woods; the engine grumbled, gravel kicked, and I was back on the road.

From past experience with long benders, I expected an oncoming train that would wreck me mentally and physically for days, but none seemed to be looming as I headed back to the city. Caffeine and nicotine withdrawal would be my only enemies, but Id been smoking real cigarettes in the dream world and Id just taken a mega-dose of the other by pill and coffee. Was Remy really that mild of a drug? I was shaky and out of it from the stress of what Id been through, but I actually felt alright.

The traffic was sparse, too, and I made great time. As I blazed along the open highway under the afternoon sun, I first marveled at the lack of other driversand then began to look at the other side of the road and in my rearview mirror. For the better part of an hour, I saw nobody at all. Had I actually come back to the real world?

Reaching the edge of the city, I pulled into a gas station and practically ran insidemy fears fell away as a clerk glanced up briefly from a magazine.

I straightened my clothing and asked in as nonchalant a manner as I could muster, Where is everyone?

The clerk pointed up to a muted television within his little blocked-off area. Games on.

I leaned against the plastic barrier to get a better angle and saw a stadium three-quarters full. Thats live?

He looked at me like I was an idiot. Yah.

I swallowed down my sense of unease, thanked him, and turned away. Having spent so much time in worlds mutable and ever-evolving, I supposed it was only natural to question base reality.

It occurred to me then that I was starving. Moving through the aisles, I let myself pick out things Id avoided for years. My childhood self had enjoyed Honey Buns; why not? And there was a Slim Jim; grabbed without hesitation. You got Zebra Cakes?

The clerk leaned forward to ask, Are there any in that aisle?

I shook my head.

Then *no.*

Right I took my vending-machine-quality loot, paid, and sat in my car and ravaged the various treats. Each tasted glorious, and I couldnt help but feebly grasp at memories of the fading sensations of those imaginary foodstuffs I had eaten in the dream world. Clearly Id survived on *something*, but it was all evaporating in the manner that most dreams tended to dissipate.


The radio, too, was an incredible opera to newly virgin ears. My favorite stations played the same old songs as always, but they held new impetus now. Looking out the window, the cracked sidewalk looked varied, permanent, and *real*, and the afternoon sky was searingly beautiful. I hated to admit it, but Id missed the real world. For all its pains and flaws, it relied on no one. It had existed before me, and it would exist after me. There was something calming in that; I didnt have to prove myself to it or defend it. It would simply exist. Or had I read that sentiment in a book somewhere?

I brushed Twinkie remains from my shirt and decided to start up the car and get back on the road; the play of the light as I turned the car fascinated me. In a flash, I remembered this feeling: I had felt it with so many interactions that had been new and intriguing back when Id been young. I could distinctly remember this emotion when a very young version of myself had continually pushed a plastic boat down into bathtub water and watched the bubbly liquid flow in and out through numerous little windows and gaps. It was physicsmy brain learning, my mind growing, my inner self compiling new data.

Id been away long enough to become new again.

I was opportunity; I was pluripotent. The shitty and depressed person I had been was now falling away with the shell of dreams already disintegrating at the edges of my thoughts. I didnt have to be that man anymore.

Checking my phone for the first time as I pulled into my parking lothow had I not thought to do that yet?I saw that I was two days late for paying rent. No worries. Nothing could stress me now. Pulling out some stashed cash from various places in my apartment, I slipped an envelope in the landlords door slot and left a note with a smiley on it.

What to do now? I had the whole world open to me.

I decided to go for a walk.

The streets were clean and quiet. As before, nobody else was around. No cars passed while I walkedoh, there was one. I relaxed for a time, but the second one did not go by for another twenty minutes. The day was beautiful, and there should have been an annoyingly huge number of joggers, dog-walkers, and children, even in my less than stellar neighborhood.

Prompted by a growing pit in my stomach, I headed back home to where my note continued to smile at an empty hallway. I knocked on my landlords door and waited.

I knocked a second time and waited.

I shouted loudly and looked up and down the hallway.

I began pounding on random doors.

Finally, I began kicking them in.

The building was empty.

Upon the last kicked-in door, I felt a terrible cold descend upon my heart: I was alone. In a space where Id previously been quiet and wary of others, I was now the only person present. In that instant, the entire feel of the place changed from comfortable communal dwelling to silent and empty maze.

In fact, the more I thought about it, the more I realized the world itself was taking on that same feeling. The streets and my building were not empty simply because of a game; sure, tens of thousands of people remained to go watch a sporting event, but that was a misleading concentration, and something was still very wrong. 

As I sat out beside the quiet parking lot and listened to the wind, I knew I was back in. The phone was already in my hand. "Wait for me. Yeah. I have to see this through to the end."

We bought replacement caffeine pills just in case and then drove out to the location in the woods we believed best fit that eerie dock. As the sun's evening blaze began to dim, we each took Remyand waited. The shadow-casting trees faded into a new kind of gloom, one backlit by glowing white lines and pitch blackness. Our ship was gone, as was Death. In his placeand vaguely lit by that remaining single beam of dark blue light high abovestood a man wearing a white suit and a calm smile.

Whereas in our last reality physics had been somewhat more concrete, here interpersonal relations seemed less a fog. For the first time, I actually perceived and remembered meeting our new Boss rather than simply becoming slowly aware of him over time while we worked.

Boss reassured us, "Worry not about having fled for a day. Every single one of us panicked at the sight of Boss when we first came here, even me. Come."

Within the walls of the hanging palace, we tread upon blackness outlined in white and shadows traced by light. The grounds and inner hallways were not upside down as I'd assumed; the palace hung from unseen solidity high above, but such construction had been done out of necessity rather than twisted dream logicwe could see that there was nothing but infinite void below. Each step elicited hesitance, for how could we tell what surfaces were material when only their outlines were visible?

Boss reassured us, "Fear not your step. Eyes evolved to serve us in another realm. Here, you must ignore them. Look not; instead, simply know. Such is the nature of dreams."

He was right. In some places, the outlines were too far away to aid in sussing out the lay of a surface, but I let go of that need and began walking as I might in a dream. It was all *there*I just needed to let it exist, and it did. Without even looking at it, I marveled at a beautiful tapestry that had formerly been nothing but complex lines of white light. There were still no colors, but the picture was an idea, and I implicitly knew what that idea was. "Who is she?"

Boss smiled, but did not answer.

We were led to the far wing of the palace where numerous laboratories were in operation. Men and women used strange devices to combine noxious and horrifying liquids comprised of various distilled nightmares and fears; other contraptions focused collected radiance from the dark blue beam of light high above usvisible right through the transparent palace wallsinto some kind of dripping extract of the same hue. This last ingredient was handled very carefully, and I looked up to take note of the fierce blue fire within that high beam. I knew now: we were close to the source.

Boss reassured us, "Don't be intimidated by this complexity, for it is not your task. These are merely your colleagues."

For the first time, we were not handling product from further down the line. Here, our job was to package, handle, and send what looked like Remy's proto-liquid form back to factories like the one at which we had previously worked. Although we did not have chemistry skills like those in the basement laboratories, I could see why this was a trusted position for men like us: at any time, we could simply hold a crate of the stuff, wake up, and run off with it. Inter-consciousness security was more or less impossible, and I now understood why this organization had been built so heavily on trust. One crate of this proto-liquid given to the right authority could end the Remy trade forever. Boss was lucky we were here for our own ends.

"Guy," I whispered as we stood at the ray-traced dock among a hundred crates and awaited the next ship. "Found anything?"

He shook his head subtly. "It's only been two weeks, though. I know she's close. I can feel her out there, in pain."

I glanced back at the palace, where Death stood in a high parapet of beautifully curved white light and watched the distance with those piercing ruby eyes. Seeing him always made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. "What's the next step?"

"We wait," Guy replied with no small frustration. "I don't even know where *next* is, let alone what it might be."

"My gut instinct says it's further down that beam."

We couldn't turn and look up at it with Death hovering over our shoulders, but we always knew where it was. It burned its presence into our minds like a bugzapper humming on a porch on a mosquito-filled summer night; here, every so often, it flared and lit each of us in dark blue.

One month passedand then a second. Guy reached his wit's end; I tried to stop him, but he was possessed now by fury born of too much time spent dwelling on the pain his friend was suffering. He stalked out to the Perpendicular Gardens, and, hoping to keep him from dooming us, I followed.

Boss was there among the outlines of strange angular plants, but his calm demeanor was absent and his white suit was in disarray. He stabbed repeatedly at various traced silhouettes; a small child, a man, a woman, and more. Each screamed, sprayed glowing white blood across his suit, and then vanished.

We stared.

He slowly regained his composure, straightened his clothing, fixed his hair, coughed once, and then regarded us with his usual calm smile. "It is my turn not to fear, for I trust that you two will not mention this to your colleagues."

Guy nodded, but asked, "Boss?"

He stopped halfway to the exit from the Gardens and said, "Yes?"

Guy pointed. "What's up there? What is the source of that blue light?"

"I've often wondered myself." He took a deep breath and then sighed in the manner of a mantra. "You know what? You two are the only ones around here I don't want to stab. Why don't we go see for ourselves?"

Guy and I exchanged worried glances, but this was finally an opportunity. For the first time, we left the main floor and ventilated basement hallways. We could still see our colleagues down in the labs toiling away, but it was much easier to look down than it was to look up. Here, too, we began to hear a subtle song.

Boss lightly twanged one of the outlines of a door. "Up here, the white lines sing."

I wondered whether it was a natural effect of hanging tension in the lines or whether we workers had been specifically denied that haunting but positive music. Death was not in his palace today, but I would likely not have asked him anyway. I had never yet heard him speak, and his direct gaze instilled paralyzing terror every time no matter how much I prepared myself.

We reached that high parapet that looked out across the sea of darkness; here, the blue beam was closer, but still far out of reach. With nothing new to see, we investigated the ceiling of each lavish room, where the solidity above had become the roof.

"There!" Guy pointed to a hatch made of dark metal, the first non-outlined object we had seen in this place. We slid a silhouette of a very fancy table over and stood on it as carefully as we could to avoid damaging itdespite it just being blank blackand the three of us managed to lift ourselves up into a chamber in the rock above.

At first, we stood in complete darkness. Each of us took out mundane objects from the palace and used their outlined light to see ahead. Through snaking tunnels curving and narrow, we made our way single file. The paths began angling up, and we walked for a time beyond measure. None of us protested, for we had certainly transgressed by now, and we were set on seeing what there was to be seen rather than face punishment empty-handed. Knowledge could not be taken away.

We came to a wider cleft, and then emerged into a roaring tunnel of glaring dark blue. The beam had cut directly through the rock at this height, and we could nearly reach out and touch the massive cylinder of flaring blue whose sheer energy brought with it incredible windsbut, wisely, we kept our hands to ourselves and inched along the warm stone.

The rock fell away, and we peered down along carved bumps and a familiar pattern in the stone: we had climbed up into a titanic stone face, and we were now looking down into the void from its eye, where the beam had penetrated straight through. For that reason, I was sure of the direction the monolith was facing, and these ancient guideposts had not yet been wrong.

Guy spoke first, ecstatic. "Do you smell that?"

I breathed in distant salt and moisture.

"It's the ocean!" he shouted, barely audible over the roar of the dark blue flames surging past us. "We're close!"

Our goal was finally in scent, if not in sight.

Beside us, Boss gazed out along the beam and into the endless void. "It's a beautiful sight, and this is the first true privacy I've ever had in this damn transparent castle. I never thought" He shook his head. "I want you boys to know that I'm not some sort of twisted freak. What I was doing back there in the Perpendicular GardensI was born broken. I've fought the urge toward violence my entire life, and I found the dream world before I cracked. I hurt illusions to calm the storm inside." He touched his suit. "No bloodstains. I remain pure."

Guy regarded him with compassionate sincerity. "We won't tell. But those in the labsthey can see you, can't they?"

Boss laughed. "The Gardens are too complex, intricate, and bright. They can't possibly tell what I'm doing from afar."

That made sense. I, too, shrugged. This man had found safe haven within; I'd likely hurt more people myself than he had. Who was I to judge him?

We made our way back down, closed the hatch, and returned to our jobs. It seemed that no one had noticed our temporary absence, or, if they had, they hadn't cared enough to say anything about it. For days in that shadowed palace of light, Guy and I discussed plans for following the beam closer to its source, and we could only come to one conclusion: we had to hijack a ship and sail it further on.

But before we could plan anything solid, we were summoned to the rear courtyard. Here, dark blue flared and lit our concerned faces, for there was no one to greet us. When we turned to leave, Boss was there, and he shook his head.

I saw blue static emerge on my hands and felt ultimate paralysis hold me fast. Dark feet echoed on dark surfaces, and Death himself approached from his high rooms in the palace of light.

Guy managed to force out, "*How could you?*"

Boss reassured us one final time. "You aren't in trouble. What we did was part of my duties, and you were curious where others were content in ignorance. For that, I am no longer your Boss." He looked at each of us in turn. "I feel a weight lifted, knowing that someone else knows. Please remember me kindly." He politely cowered away as our new Boss approached.

He stood before us an infinitely black silhouette of a man with piercing ruby points for eyes, and, at long last, those eyes regarded us directly. The force of animal fear inside me rose to an overwhelming pressure, and I would have screamed or panicked had that blue shock not held us in place.

He looked at Guy, and Guy threw fierce anger back with his gaze as he strained to move.

He looked at me, and I saw an endless ruby expanse down which the glittering memories of all mankind would one day passbut, for reasons beyond my direct comprehension at that moment, I was suddenly no longer afraid. At this, Death tilted his head ever so slightly.

He had no mouth, but we heard him thus: **I believe that I should punish your curiosity by rewarding you with the knowledge you unknowingly sought. Would you like to see what is beyond this protective veil of shadow?**

The paralysis lifted; we were allowed to move.

I looked to Guy and nodded. I would not deny him this. Not now.

Guy looked to me, then to Death. He answered that Doom with both fear and determination: "Yes." </TEXT>

Ohh, right. Hmm, the only thing I can say to that is I attempted to portray the patients as victims rather than evil. There's a strong social theme in that series behind why these people had breakdowns. </TEXT>

---

For the first time, Tom and I were together without Jake. I tried to come up with a nonchalant way to ask, but, as we sat outside Jake's factory and watched his boss with binoculars, I realized there would be no hiding my concern. It was better to be direct. "So how did you guys end up having to kill Lying Bitch, exactly?"

"Um, we already went over that," Tom replied. He took a bite from one of his donuts. "Ugh, I've gained five pounds since this all started. I can't help but stress eat."

I lowered my binoculars as another car passed our spot. "So you *are* stressed?"

He didn't reply. His eyes remained on his hands.

"Did Jake make it necessary to kill her?"

He winced. "I don't know, not exactly. She got our masks off somehow in the strugglebut he *was* the one who insisted we couldn't let her live after she saw our faces." He wiped donut crumbs away from his mouth. "When I didn't want to do it at first, he got scary."

That's what I'd expected to hear. "So we can assume he'll get scary again if we don't go through with this." Lifting my binoculars to peer at the factory grounds some more, I watched Callous Bastard scold a worker whose shirt sleeve had gotten caught in an improperly tuned machine and torn off. Jake had already told us the kind of things he might be saying, and I could hear them now: *Get back to work, and be less clumsy next time!* As expected, nobody fixed the machine. The same worker continued to warily slide materials through it, this time with his other sleeve rolled up nearly to his shoulder.

I might have asked Tom to look up some videos of what happened to workers who truly got injured this way, but we hadn't brought our cellphonesthey were basically live tracking devices. The more I'd learned about our society's 'soft secrets,' the more I'd realized we were all basically slaves to multiple invisible masters. Those who tracked our every call, email, text, and location were among the higher lords. These bosses at our places of work were actually the absolute lowest on the totem pole of the shit waterfall, and yet they took the brunt of our hate; meanwhile, ninety-five percent of my productivity went to some faceless asshole shareholder living it up in a mansion somewhere. We should have been allied with our cruel bosses against those unknown men. Why were we instead at odds?

Making an excuse about having to piss, I walked a couple blocks and made an anonymous call from a payphone. My call would not bear fruit for a few days; for now, my lunch hour was over, and it was time to head back to work. I returned and said goodbye to Tom.

Work was strange and different. My men were productive and happy, and we were all having a great time working in a way I'd never thought possible. The office was supposed to be a place of quiet desperation and eternal suffering in a thousand nebulous ways that could not be resisted. That was what we had been told all our lives, what we had been shown every day of our careers, and what television promised was the only way. Turned out, once incentives were aligned correctly and the team was all on the same page, work didn't have to be shit.

Work didn't have to be shit.

I sat at my desk and stared at the wall for a good twenty minutes as I repeated those words over and over in my head. If work didn't have to be shit, then what was the source of that universal cruelty that made hollow shells out of modern men? Where did it come from? Why did it exist?

It took nearly a week, but I managed to time our stakeout correctly. Tom and I sat on a low hill among the rundown buildings to the south of the factory while the inspector I'd tipped off came to take a look at the factory's many egregious violations.

"He's outside and looking at the back near the river," Tom said excitedly. "I thinkyes, he sees the illegal dumping, too!"

I grinned and took my turn on the binoculars. The inspector was a balding man in an aging brown suit, but he did *not* look happy. He stood alone with Callous Bastard while they both argued with sweeping hand motions. This would take care of Jake's boss, and there would be no need for a beating that I knew our third accomplice expected to end in death. "Damnit, Callous Bastard," I muttered. "We're trying to save your life here. Just face the music and find another job."

Finally, the argument stopped. Callous Bastard went back into the factory, slipped into his office, and then returned as casually as possible. Curious, I watched him hand over a brown envelope.

"What's he doing?" Tom asked.

My heart sank as I saw the inspector take it; the envelope's color matched his faded suit, and I immediately understood how factories like this one avoided cleaning up their act. The balding man pulled out and rifled through a stack of cash before hurriedly putting it away inside his jacket. "Goddamnit! He paid him off!"

Crestfallen, Tom asked, "So we really have to do this, don't we?"

I hated to admit it, but, "Yeah."

We had a clandestine meeting with Jake scheduled three nights later. At that bar an hour out from town, we again paid in cash and commiserated over the progress of the operation.

Jake swallowed his first beer in a single breath and slammed it on the table. "So how's the plan coming together, guys?"

I looked to Tom, but I knew it would be up to me to speak. "It's coming together. I guess I had a concernthe first two ended with deaths. I'd like to avoid that if possible, since it was never the plan."

Glowering, Jake stared us both down. "My friend Jorge had his left arm degloved six months ago because Callous Bastard refuses to pay for proper maintenance. You know what degloving is?"

Holding back a small urge to vomit, I nodded weakly.

"You know the kind of screams a man makes when he's degloved?" Jake continued, his gaze haunted. "Because I do."

Tom covered his mouth and excused himself to get us each another beer.

"That's alright buddy," Jake called after him with sincere permission. "You don't need to hear this." He leaned closer to me and listed the fourteen injuries and two deaths the men at his factory had suffered in the last several years. "I get it. We're men, we work dangerous jobs. But you know what rides my ass? You know what makes me *violent?*" He accepted one of the three new beers as Tom returned. Taking a swig of it, he sighed darkly. "Motherfucking Callous Bastard always profusely promises to fix things, and, for a few months, things do get betterand then he just kind of lets it slide once corporate attention moves on. What makes me *violent* is this little fucking speech I've heard a half dozen times now: *this was a tragic accident that could have happened to any one of us, so we all need to pitch in to keep safety standards high.* No, Bastard, it could not have happened to any one of us. It could have happened to us guys actually on the floor, but not *you*, because you're safe in your little office."

It might have been a bad time to spark that conversation, but it'd already been on my mind: "Jake, is he who you're really mad at? Shouldn't you be angry with the corporate higher ups that let him do that so they can get rich off your labor?"

He went dead cold and just stared at me.

I gulped. "Like what if Callous Bastard does dieand I'm not saying we're going to kill himwhat if they just replace him with another? The way he runs that place makes them more money, and that's all they care about."

Tom cut in for the first time. "You know how you could tell?"

Jake replied flatly, "How."

"Go visit other factories your company runs," he explained, looking rather proud of himself. "If they've each got their own Callous Bastard, then you'll know."

Jake stood then, pointed down at each of us with a furious glareand then, as we'd practiced, he walked casually away so as not to make a scene.

Our next meeting was two weeks away, but neither of us was sure whether he would be there. In the meantime, we stopped tailing his boss, and I dealt with slowly increasing pressure from above at work. Our numbers were up. Why were they giving me shit? I protected my men as best I could until the day of the next meeting came. This time we were on a balcony at second-story bar downtown. It was dark and loud, and nobody would remember us.

"Fine," Jake told us, still sullen. "You were right. There's a Bastard for each factory. It's not his fault; hell, they *chose him because he was that way.* We can't take it out on him."

We both sighed. "Awesome. Let's be done with this horrible misadventure"

"Oh its not over," he retorted. "I went to bat for both of you, and we are stuck in this until it's even."

Tom clutched his margarita close. "But then what do you want us to do?"

"All this started with the current CEO," he told us, his fists clenched. "I want you to attack Rich Asshole instead."

I wasn't having it. "Are you serious? He's probably got a security system, a big house, maybe even bodyguards!"

Tom, too, thought it was a bad idea. "It'll draw a ton of attention. Nobody cares about poor people, remember? But they'll investigate the death of a rich person for years."

"Not this one," Jake countered. "Trust me."

"It'll take months to do the legwork," I complained. "I can't keep slipping off from work that long. Eventually, someone will notice."

Jake shook his head. "No. I spent the last two weeks figuring it out myself. He's already here."

Tom and I looked at each other in surprise, and then at the target of Jake's focused gaze. At the far end of the hip downtown bar, a pepper-haired older man sat with his arm around a thin young blonde girl that looked like she'd gotten in here with a fake ID.

Turning back, I vehemently asked, "The hell is this?"

"This is so stupid," Tom added, fearful. "We're gonna get caught if we do it like this."

Jake shook his head again. "I've got all the tools we need in my car down the street. We just hang out, have a good time, and follow him when he takes that girl back to wherever. We make it look like a mugging, and that's that. Nothing to investigate."

"And you're coming with us?" I asked, surprised. "We were supposed to take turns."

"Fuck it," he muttered. "This is big game now. It's all in. I'm doing this." He ground his teeth for a moment. "And if you don't help me, I'll turn you both in."

"Whoah!" Tom and I both replied, our hands up and out in diplomatic pause. "Fine."

I wasn't that surprised. I'd more or less expected a last-minute power play like that. The only saving grace was that it looked like Jake had actually thought it all through. We sipped beers for several hours while Rich Asshole tooled around with his date and her gorgeous friends; he even danced for a bit on the floor. Come on man, have some respect! Or of course he wouldn't care. The world was his. He might even have owned the bar itself.

That thought stunned me. I was one of the slaves, used to other people that went *to* places rather than owned them; the concept of owning an entire establishment shocked me to my core when I really tried to process it. I literally owned nothing. My place could be taken at any time whether I made my monthly payment or not, same as my car, and I lived in constant servitude to 'afford' those meager necessities. This guy had final say-so over *buildings* and *bars*. The whole idea was insane.

By the time he finally left with his date, my fury likely matched Jake's. The three of us headed on down, quickly got our tools out of Jake's trunk, and caught up to Rich Asshole in an alley. He was drunk and headed toward his car in a parking garage up ahead; the angles were such that this was as good a place as any. We maintained drunken laughter and conversation right up until we were hitting him with pipes that we had hidden up our sleeves; his date leapt away, but remained frozen in shock.

And you know what? Our laughter and conversation continued. "Did you see that one bartender?" I asked Tom as I struck down at Rich Asshole's bleeding forehead.

"Oh man, she was gorgeous," Tom replied, hitting the man's shaking legs.

"You guys are nuts," Jake said, cracking his ribs. "She was an eight *at best.*"

Beside us, his date slowly came back to her senses as she watched us beat himand she came over, spit on him, and began kicking his unmoving body. "Asshole!"

We shared a surprised genuine laugh at that.

She bent down carefully, pulled out his wallet, and ran off as quickly as her high heels would allow.

And then we were walking; a few quick wipes, a few visual scans of each other, and we were clear of obvious blood. The pipes we slid back up our sleeves until we reached the car, and then we went home, burned those clothes, buried everything that needed buried, and went our separate ways.

That was the first murder that I felt literally no guilt over. In fact, it felt like a tremendous victory. I'd managed to spare Callous Bastard's life in exchange for that of a systemic asshole whose own date had despised him. As far as we could tell, the police chalked it up to a mugging gone wrong like we'd hoped, and over the next few weeks I watched for news of Jake's company; the new CEO promised to do things differently, and many managers and corrupt practices were rooted out. Callous Bastard himself was out of the picture soon afterit was a win for everyone.

The problem with that kind of victory, though, is that you can never erase the memory of it. At work and at home, when things go wrong you always remember that there's a viable ace in the hole if you really need it. Pressure on me from above at my company increased as the months wore on, and I thought often of the single remaining meeting the three of us had planned. One year from the last of our three murders, we were to meet four states over in a run-down bar in a highway-exit town with a population of five hundred. This last meeting was supposed to be for comparing notes and handling any lingering problems, but, as the full year approached its end, I was surprised to find myself hoping for a little bit more than that.

Apparently, Tom and Jake had similar ideas.

	<TEXT>  Is Murphy's demon a reference to a certain concept?

Wow, I just googled it, and I'm floored by how few references there are. That's really weird.

I suppose that means I should state - Murphy's demon is an imaginary personification of Murphy's law: *Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.* </TEXT>

Out in the open, there was nowhere to go. Massive dark limbs reached down and began snapping them up one by one even as other portions of the beast fought at the darting and slicing gnat that valiantly tried to delay it.

Showman struggled to breathe as curled muscle lifted him above the clouds and into the direct harshness of the noon sun. The next limb over held Neil, and they groaned curses to each other and laughed with the dark humor of men about to die.

At the last, the mask fell away, and Neil called over tearfully, "I'm glad I'm not alone."

"Me too, mate." Showman beat at the tentacle around his waist one last time in futile resistance. "Me too."

He watched Neil throw something into the distance, and he realized

but it was throwing them, then, and he sailed through open air only to slam into hard enamel. Sliding down white alongside his shouting friend, he grasped at anything he could, including two different arms. Above, someone pulled him up, and below, he pulled Neil in turn.

They found themselves in a horrible stench-filled cavity dripping with black goo; here multiple people clung to holes and pillars of raw bone in a last-ditch effort not to get eaten. He'd been suffocated, drenched, shot at, and even killed all in one day, but this most horrible fate left him numb. He watched as Neil spoke sadly with Doctor Wygant, who clung nearby, and then looked on in distant surprise as his friend slid over and sent the Doc teleporting somewhere. So Neil had used his crystalline-lattice gemstone to save the doctor. Had Cade already blinked home? He slid forward, grabbed his friend's forearm to keep him from slipping out, and hung there for a time as the forces of the beast's motion battered them back and forth.

"I've got one," he murmured, pulling the last resort from his pocket. "I've got one, too."

Clinging to a piece of bone while those around them screamed and cried and prayed, Neil nodded. "Then get outta here, man. Don't be here for this."

"I can't do that," Showman heard himself saying from a place of numb and objective distance. "You've got a baby. You have to take it. I think" He hesitated. "I think I was brought here for a reason; I think I'm here as a last chance to redeem myself."

"Why would you need redemption?" Neil forced out as the G-forces compressed them both mightily.

There were so many things he needed to say; so many things he wished he could explain, but there was no time. He held out the device

and watched in dull annoyance as a change in the titan's motion ripped it right out of his hand and sent it flying.

"Oh. Well shit."

"It's alright," Neil laughed. "I would never have taken it. I just"

But then bits of bone snapped, and he went sliding off and into the open air. It was inevitable, really, so Showman let go and slid out after him without even a split second's hesitation. They sailed down past horrible organic walls and down into green fog.

"This sucks!" Neil shouted at the top of his lungs.

"Sure does!" Showman shouted back, laughing. Horror and fear only went so far; there was nothing left to do but enjoy the ride. Together, they soared down into a massive chamber that seemed to hold its own internal world; they took in what majesty they could.

But Murphy's demon was still with him, alighting on his shoulder even as he fell, and Showman asked in furious consternation, "No! Why are you still here? How can you **possibly make this worse?!**"

His imaginary companion just grinned. </TEXT>

But then he sailed onto a placid lake in a calm boat on a sunny day, and the screaming faded beyond the pattern that had been unknowable but which was now coherent here in insanity. She was smaller than he remembered, for he was much bigger now than he had been then, and she touched that part of his face that parted unseen calm waters. In words without words, she said: *Everything's going to be alright. You did the best you knew how.*

That was all he had been given; all that he had been allowed. As the pattern and calm faded and the infinite screaming began again, he closed his eyes, sighed, and let the tears roll down his face. Those malignant accusers could not reach him now, for he'd done the best he knew how. Some glimmering of existence had clung to that placid lake and sunny day; some halo of truths far and near. He knew he and Cade hadn't made it in time; he knew the Waystation had been destroyed, and that Neil had been eatenbut Kumari and her mother's doppelganger had made it to safety.

As his bindings came loose and as he tumbled from his bike in some distant physical plane, he lay at peace. That cute little innocent baby had been spared, and that was enough. Death would not release him from this place of purple chaos, and what was coming in terms of an eternity spent wandering here insane was too unpleasant to consider, but that one consolation was enough.

His vomit was not white; his vomit was red, for his stomach had filled with blood from his lethal injury. He coughed up more and then rolled over under a clear blue sky. The ashen woman looked down at him with curiosity, dragged him a bit further from the rift, and then moved to check on Cade.

Shewhat? He sat up and looked around in hungover amazement. Where the purple had driven him and his companion crazy, it had cleared *her* head; she was already carrying herself with more grace and dignity as she tended to self-inflicted scratches on Cade's cheeks that had mercifully avoided his eyes.

"No time," Cade grunted as he weakly tore the ropes off his bike and climbed on once more. "Can't use the radio. Gotta get there."

Showman wanted to tell him that it was too late, but the visions and patterns were already fading from his memory in the manner of a dream lost. Forcing his shaking limbs to still, he too mounted his bike, and the three of them rode along ridges he recognized. This time, their ashen companion held on to Cade's waist of her own accord and kept her gaze forward on what was to come.

They rounded the last ridge, coming from a different angle than most, for their path was not one any sane human could endure. Around that final cliff-bound edge, they turned, and

The Waystation was there, and countless men stood atop a dead beast of mountainous proportions. Had they *melted its face off with acid?* Then that meant they'd actually finished the defense system in time. He shook his head as they approachedhe chided himself for trusting the premonitions of a hallucination in an insanity reality. He came to a stop and dismounted alongside Cade and their acquired guest.

A positively glowing man stood atop a high cliff above the Waystation's piled rock walls and native-wood hatches. Showman gazed up in surprise, and that burn-scarred champion looked back down with the samebut not at him. It was the man who had built the walls in silence, Showman realized, but it seemed as if his unspoken horrible despair had liftedand it looked as if he and this woman knew each other.

She stepped forward with a curious and positive expression, about to speak, until the men pulling their comrades from the stomach of the dead beast turned and stared in horror out toward the horizon. He could feel the shaking earth now, tremors born of that greater titan Casey had spoken of, and he now realized what these men had done. Their victory had been hollow; they had killed naught but a baby, and in so doing ensured their own vengeful destruction. The hurricane roar that followed seemed to shake the planet itself.

With a strange fuzzy feeling in his head, he looked to Cade, but, while everyone else was still frozen, his companion was already on the move. Stunned himself by a strange and overpowering sense of dj vu, Showman raised a hand and shouted to the one person he recognized. There among the men standing on the melted beast was his one true friend out hereNeil.

His shout broke the spell, and crowds of men surged away from the oncoming death. Neil ran toward the Waystation with dozens of others; locked in place, Showman felt his hovering invisible little emerald imp settle on his shoulder.

"Are you real?" he asked breathlessly, his horrified gaze fixated on the approaching horizon-spanning mass of tentacles and fury. "Or am I still under that purple sky?" But there was no response, and that momentary sense of companionship faded with an ethereal sigh.

Freed, he ran after his friend as the woman he and Cade had brought shot her arms out to either side, summoned up a great tide of determinationalong with a sphere of bright white lightand rose into the sky to face the oncoming titan. The blazing winds of her inner force cleared the ash from her, and healthy flushed skin and short blonde hair emerged as if from an egg of pure energy. He'd heard of herof course he hadbut this was not the artificially immortal dead woman the rumors said had white blood.

There was hope. It rushed him instinctively. This was not the immortal recluse Goddessthis was more than that. He'd actually seen her vomiting up the last remains of whatever abomination she'd turned herself into all those centuries ago. Just like everyone else, *she'd come back to life too.* She shot forward at speed with the phoenix grace of a comet, and he sent his awed hopes after her in support while he ran.

"Neil!" All strategic thought blanked out by adrenaline, he dashed within the open gate and continued shouting for his friend among screamed orders and yells of terror. He'd seen this place destroyed in a state of being beyond time and space, and yet here it was. *What was happening?*

He grabbed at the first person he recognized. Her blonde hair stood out from the crowd; it was Pixley. "Holy shit!"

"Showman, you're here?" she asked, aghast. "We have to get out of here!"

"They're gonna throw the coup tomorrow," he shouted, desperate to get his delivered message to her while he still had the chance. "We need you to come stop them."

The crowd thinned as the crowd began running for the tunnels at the end of the Waystation. She threw off his grip. "Kinda the last thing on my mind right now!"

"Her Glory will take care of this," he insisted. "But *we* have to go, or it'll be a disaster. This is our fault!"

"The Machine Empress is *here?*" she asked, reflexively looking deeper into the canyon the way she had come. "Is that what all that light was about?"

There was no time to argue further. He led her toward the bikes that he and Cade had brought just as the crowds that had passed them one way began turning around and running back out. At their forefront was Cade, who repeated his orders: "That thing will tear this place apart! We can't hide, we have to run!"

Two people got ahead of them and took the bikes; cursing, Showman dodged through the stampede. There was no strategy or alternative now; as one, the entire male population of the Waystation ran for their lives toward the massive rift to the next world. Down the slope they went, shouting, fearful, and determined, until Showman stumbled across his friend by pure chance. "Neil!"

"Showman, damnit. I thought you'd be safe from this!" The sweaty engineer ran alongside him, and they clasped arms briefly with regret while on the move.

His lungs began burning, but he managed to ask, "Where are the women and children? Is Kumari safe?"

Neil nodded. In between breaths, he explained, "Cade told us to send them into the cavesthe beast doesn't know about them. It saw us kill its baby; it's us it'll come after."

"Shit."

"Yeah, right?"

There was no more breath for talking as the massive crowd approached the gigantic fluttering region of broken space ahead. Even at a downhill run, they were much slower than the huge beast behind, and they looked up while moving to see a furious sphere of white light alternately dodging and sprouting blades of energy to slice at countless tentacles.

"She's not gonna win, is she?" Neil asked.

He hated to admit it, but"No, I don't think so."

The anonymous enemy shook his helmeted head. Blood soaked his grey jacket, continuing to well from inside.

"I think his auto-suicide device malfunctioned," Cade said. "We actually have a chance to get some answers."

Nodding, Showman kneeled next to him. "Tell us who you are."

The anonymized voice held a surprising amount of fear. **Don't let me die. Please.**

Cade reached for his black helmet.

**No.** Their captive lifted an arm along the ground to point at the back of his helmet. **You have to disable the explosive first.**

"If I turn you over, you'll bleed out twice as fast."

**Just just**

"Come on," Cade said. "Tell us something useful! Give us a reason to save your life!"

**Justin**

Showman returned to his bike to find some basic medical supplies and ran back to their captive. Medical training, medical trainingcome on, what did he remember? Too, he'd mostly paid attention at Doctor Wygant's little seminar barely two weeks before. What had she said? Trying his best, he unzipped that bloody grey jacket and began applying antiseptic and bandages. After that, he put pressure on the deep stab wound.

**I'm fourteen**

Cade hesitated, then withdrew his knee from the boy's neck. "Seriously?"

**I went to a movie with a girl named Sarah I wanted to say something but I didn't**

"No," Cade told him, his resolve shaken. "No, don't start talking like that!"

**I wanted to live I want to know what there is there's so much I never got to feel you monsters took it away I want you to tell her so that she knows. You owe me.**

"Where? Where do you live? *Where is she?*"

A grey-gloved hand gripped Cade's collar. **You disgust me.**

"What?" Cade frowned with unhappy confusion. "Where's this girl you want us to talk to?"

In a way, their scattered position among abandoned cars determined the first shot. The impact cracked the boy's helmet and audibly splattered gore within his black visor. Looking up with surprise and fury respectively, Showman and Cade sighted the better-equipped Grey Riders approaching down the highway in the distance. A sniper on top of a distant overturned sixteen-wheeler was already reloading.

There was no need to speak. They bolted for their bikes, set them upright, re-secured their delirious guest, and rode at as high a speed as they dared. Behind them, the more-experienced Grey Riders slowly began to shrink the gap; there would already have been clean shots if not for the jumbled vehicles.

"The hell with this," Cade radioed. "Switch your comms to the channel I'll indicate with my hand. They know our frequency."

Showman watched, and then tapped the channel over. "What's up?"

"We can't outrun them, we can't outfight them, and I have a feeling we've stumbled into something extremely important here. Their top brass and best soldiers are after us, and I think we both know why. What's the rift compass show? We're gonna roll a hard six."

"A couple options, but except for the one we're already shooting for, they're all bad to worse," Showman reported, trying to ride and look down at the same time. He blinked as he thought he saw a tiny emerald reflection glinting near one he would never have otherwise considered. "There is, uh, one that will take us straight to the Waystation with only one hop, and those bastards definitely won't follow."

"What's wrong with it?" Cade asked warily.

Showman wasn't sure he wanted to tell his companion, because he knew what the likely next step would bebut dying had shown him some very strange things. Was his pet Murphy's demon trying to help or harm? Uncertain, he let the words fall. "It's an insanity reality."

"Well, shit." Cade sighed. "We'll figure something out. Lead the way."

They turned down an off-ramp and sped along a wide country road; luckily, the Grey Riders continued along the highway in error, but neither man thought that mistake would last long. Far from the blasted wasteland they'd put behind them, the greenery here was lush and alive. Showman would have thought it relieving and peaceful had the sun not been embracing noon directly above. Time was almost up, and his friend and his friend's baby might pay the price.

Their path took them deep into undeveloped woods, and they stopped before the triple-forked near-vertical rift; dozens of markers here practically screamed the color purple. "Huh," Cade realized. "So our people did come through herebut didn't realize there were cities nearby."

It was the same mistake he himself had subconsciously made, Showman realized: each Earth was huge. What was desolate in one area might not have been in another. Could there be whole civilizations out here they just hadn't managed to stumble onto? The Zkiraxno. He shook his head. He didn't want to think about that. If those being eaten couldn't die

Cade studied the landscape beyond with binoculars from one of his bike's compartments. The sky boiled purple above, but he did not balk. "At least it's flat enough. You know I can actually see the next rift from here?"

Showman dismounted and took a turn with the binoculars. It was true: slightly to the left, a glimmer of blue sky hinted at the Waystation's reality a veritable stone's throw from their position. It was maddening in a sense similar to what would happen under that purple sky to see safety so closeand yet so far away.

"I think we lash the bikes together for added stability," Cade guessed. "Then we aim them right at that rift and hope our aim is straight enough. Even a degree or two off could mean missing it."

"Shit house plan," Showman murmured, trying to come to terms with what needed to be done. "But we gotta. I can't even say why exactly. Just, those people deserve it."

Cade nodded. There was nothing else to debate. Together, the two men tied the bikes together as best they could, locked the handlebars, and secured their mumbling guest behind them. In the distance, the sound of approaching engines hinted that their pursuers had guessed at their insane gamble and come to stop them.

There was no exchange of last minute words. They jammed a stick into the works to push the gas pedals at the exact same rate, and the bikes took off. At the last second, each battened down his own arms against stories of men clawing out their own eyes under the ghastly haunt of purple skies.

The pressure was instantaneous. Not long before, he'd been battered about by the tremendous forces of life and death; this attacked his mind rather than his soul. He could feel memories and senses blurring, blending, and buckling. Showman, he told himself, repeating his chosen name. I'm Showman. Remember that! There were no thoughts for the bleak landscape or the purple sky; these things had already fallen away.

"You failed," someone murmured. "You didn't make it to the Waystation, and it was destroyed."

"Who's that?" he shouted.

"You failed," another voice whispered. "Your co-conspirators attacked moments after you left, and everyone at Concord is dead."

"Go to hell!"

"You failed," came the reply. "You didn't tell anyone what the dead workers were planning, and they went on strike moments after you left. Everyone at Concord starved to death."

"No!" He began screaming against the anguish of all these truths being self-evident. Each internalized itself in the pain in his heart; he had no defenses.

"You failed," his father spat. "You didn't say anything about what the Zkirax were planning, and now billions of people are in pain in insect stomachs."

"It wasn't my place!" he cried. "I was told not to say anything!"

"Everyone's gonna die out here, and there's nothing you can do. You're a fraud. A show."

"I can't be the only one that knows!" he screamed. "They're all talk! They'll never do it!"

"Which one?"

"All of them!"

"*You're* all talk."

A circle of spectral men with no faces surrounded him; the Ghost Council, here made literal. Each demanded he obey.

He ran.

The screaming multitudes in that thunderous vortex of white and black were now screaming at *him*. It was fault, personally, that each of them had died and been made to suffer. These accusations were simply true. He could not reject them.

Guilt, pain, loneliness. There was no separating it from the self. All logic and analysis had come apart, and he was shifting emotion, pure and agonizing. Somewhere, a drumbeat peaked toward critical failure; his heart, threatening to beat right out of his chest.

**State your demands.**

Showman looked to Cade, but there was only one answer. "Withdraw! Leave us alone. We've no intent to have a blue with you!"

**That's ridiculous. We've got you surrounded and** The Grey Leader's black helmet turned slightly, indicating that he was looking beyond. After a frozen instant, he took a step back. Despite the anonymous exterior, it was clear he'd been taken aback by shock.

Showman turned to look behind with a horrible feeling of enlightenment.

Cade turned to look behind in askance.

Their half-dressed companion bent down suddenly and vomited. Thick white ooze spilled out onto the charred ground, revealing little wires and slime-covered bits of chrome in the goop. She clung to the soot and coughed painfully.

The surrounding fourteen made various movements of horror, awe, and imminent violence, but their Leader stopped them with a raised hand. **Did you think I wouldn't recognize you with different hair.**

She finally focused through her half-delirium for a solid gaze forward. This word Showman understood. This single word broke his heart for all its implications and layers of meaning. She asked, with utmost hope and despair:

"Conrad?"

The Grey Leader wavered in place. Showman actually wondered if the man was about to fall, but instead

**Let them go.**

Fourteen anonymized voices rose in a robotic choir of confused complaints, but their Leader again stopped them with a single hand.

**Now's not the time,** he said, recovering some of his composure. **This moment isn't worth the lives of everyone here. Withdraw.**

One of the fourteen raised a weapon; a sudden gunshot evaporated him into an amethyst after-glow. Showman looked back to the Grey Leader, whose pistol still smoked in a shaking hand.

**Withdraw.**

Showman held off a painful heart rate that threatened to knock him unconscious as the Grey Riders *actually turned and rode away.* Snipers in the buildings above raised bits of cloth to indicate their position and peaceful intention, and he and Cade clutched their strange companion close for fear of one final shot against orders.

"What's the range on this thing?" Showman asked, indicating the rift compass in his sweat-covered and shaking hand.

"Large enough," Cade said, his eyes on the skeletal buildings around them. "Let's move. If we don't stop the rest of the way, we might still make it in time."

She was back to mumbling and obliviousness, but now they had ample opportunity to tie her to Cade by the waist again. At dangerous speeds, they skirted ruined vehicles, but after that the open highway was clear enough that they could max out the speedometer and recover lost time.

Wary and coming down from intense stress, Showman felt cast back a bit into the attitudes of the impudent teenager he'd once been. "Are we gonna talk about how this little lady of ours just barfed up some science fiction shit?"

"Nah," Cade radioed back. "Nobody's perfect."

His anger shifted to laughter unexpectedly. "Fine, you're the one with her arms wrapped around you."

"That just means I'll be the first to know if she's a monster."

"Better you than me." Showman's second laugh fell short as he saw a figure in a grey uniform leap out from the hood of a truck. At top speed, the enemy's long piece of rebar blew right through his chest, and he tumbled brutally across the roadslamming the rod into cement repeatedlyeven as he felt his mind pulling away from his body.

*Shit, did I just die?* His words echoed in eternal darkness as the sensations of his life faded into echoes. *Those bastards! A second ambush!* If he had to be honest about itand honesty was all that he had left, nowhe and Cade should have expected it. Once they were out of range of the fiery death rift that someone or something had opened in the city center, there was no longer any mutually assured destruction, and the Grey Riders were militarily organized and resourceful as hell.

But those concerns were falling away from him now as he seemed to be soaring toward some tremendous cascading roar in the infinite distance. It approached as a white speck, but instantly took an eternity to grow to perceptible size; he splashed with untold force into blindingly white waters and began flailing about in whatever way a soul could flail. Surfacing into a choir of countless screams, shouts, and cries for help, he expected to find the whirlpool Neil had described or the hole Edgar had talked about. Instead, he found himself circling vertically rather than horizontallythis was no whirlpooland inside the maw of a colossal spiraling tunnel of rough white-light water shot through with un-black lightning. If any sight or thought in his entire life had spoken to him of wrongness or danger, this did so exponentially more: this vast rupture the diameter of a mountain and the length of a cathedral was frightening and awe-inspiring to the very core of the soul.

Literally, he supposed, since he was just a soul now.

And here he could see his torturing imp. It was not purple as he had imagined, but emerald, and comprised of fractally perpendicular light. It had no face, but it had intent, and it began to drag him through the worlds-wide thunderous vortex faster than the other souls.

He refused.

He began swimming the other way.

The tide was tremendous in force, and he had no strength other than his own sudden flaring need, but he fought both the glowing white and jagged emerald. Screaming, horrified, and confused faces surged past him in the flood, but he grabbed at their shoulders and pulled his way along. Aheadahead!surely this sight was the Domain of All, the Unknowable, the Place Where All Roads Meetit was everything and nothing at once; it registered naught on his brain or memories, and left no image in his eyes if he even had any, but he knew. He was the only one looking ahead into death rather than back toward life.

The force increased as he approached the eye of the great white storm; the pressures threatened to tear apart his very soul, and that vicious crackling un-black lightning seared the waters around him. Here, there were less faces and shoulders, and he leapt from gaping screaming mouth to gaping screaming mouth, desperate. His handdid he have a hand?gripped the edge of infinity, and he used all his remaining willpower to drag his face toward the forever expansive but mentally opaque terminus. He shook mightily, bringing his eyes right up to that barrier. If this place had distances, he was millimeters away; he was staring right at it, closer than his non-eyes could focus, yet the resistance had become impossible, and his strength here was at an end.

The torturous emerald imp hovered away for a moment, its pushback gone. It consideredand then floated down behind him to assist.

His face splashed into waters beyond comprehension, and he used his single moment beyond to scream: "*Mum!*"

Something did happen, but the pattern was too big for his awareness to understand. He had only that instant before he fell back, spent. The titanic vortex cast him about mercilessly, threatening to drown him in radiant white, but for the lack of lungs he survived. He sped around and around to terrifying speeds, sailing along with screaming millions down toward white beyond beholding

and sat up, once more in his body, his hand already balling into a fist to thump the chest of a Grey Rider who had bent down to make sure he was finished.

It had only been an instant. The dozen grey-clad ambushers flooding in with melee weapons had hardly moved since his last living flash of awareness. All thatall that he had perceived and suffered in the higher realms of existencehad happened in a fraction of a second. Too, he saw that his attackers were poorly equipped, and he realized Edgar had been right. The Grey Riders had spread themselves thin and overextended their equipment and forces. What he and Cade had seen back in that flame-ruined city had been the best of the best, the elite, and the well-equipped core.

The Grey Rider he had sucker-punched now scrambled back in fear. How much experience had they had with the dead coming back to life? Little, Showman imagined, even as the extents of his own awareness returned and brought him back his assumed name. His helmet had fallen somewhere, so he donned an evil grin to augment the showand pulled the rebar right out of his own chest. Wielding it menacingly, he struck blow after blow at the men around him, who soon realized they literally could not stop him. One particularly vicious strike sent a Grey Rider tumbling back into fine amethyst mist as his auto-suicide mechanism kicked in.

The anonymous ambushers had no choice but to retreat.

Breathing deep with one healthy lung and one flapping and wheezing inside his chest, Showman examined his own woundsjust the initial one, really, that had killed himand then he walked over in a surreal daze to where Cade was interrogating a captured Rider.

Cade himself had suffered only minor knife wounds to his arms, slices which he might have avoided if he'd still had his jacket, and their strange female companion made motions in the air and gave no sign she knew that a fight had even taken place. Cade took one look over, grimaced at seeing his fatal open wound, and then returned his knee to the Rider's neck. "*Who are you people?*"

"Looks like the next rift is in that city," Cade radioed. "I don't like this one bit. This place is death."

"Should we try another one?" Showman asked, looking up to gauge the hour.

The man in the lead gave the only answer he could. "No time."

The cadaverous skyscrapers of this unknown city's downtown area approached like ominous mountains. Around them, the shells of buildings began to ascend in remaining height. The going was easier on a flat road, but numerous ruined cars and trucks littered the way. Their windows had been blackened by heat, and Showman felt alternately compelled to avoid looking or definitely look, both for fear of seeing zombie-like movement within. The corpses here were nothing but black bones with bits of seared meat remaining; if they were still in those prisons of bone, it would be quite some time before they could move again. "What the hell did this?"

His usual composure cracking, Cade answered with a surprisingly strained tone. "It's like somebody just dropped fire on this place. A nuke would have caused way more destruction."

Showman looked straight up in awe as the first girder-skeleton skyscraper blocked the sun overhead. "This isn't destruction?" His companion didn't answer, but he could sort of see what the man had meant: a nuke dropped on this city would have demolished all of these buildings straight out, not just gutted them. Unconsciously, he sent a hand down to touch the gemstone in his pocketif a weapon like the one that had hit this place did go off, there would be fractions of a second to bail.

Cade held up a hand, and Showman stopped in kind immediately. Beyond that final corner lay the downtown center of the city, where all these artificial canyons met, andwait, that *was* odd. The question didn't even have to be spoken aloud: why was the rift out of here in the city center? Taking their helmets off and peering around a blackened marble edge, they could see the partially-closed rift pulsating quietly in what had once been a park. The lawns and sidewalks were gone now, replaced by sheer brown and black, but the design of the space remained. The shell of City Hall sat on a raised hill beyond.

If something had felt wrong before, that feeling had now magnified a thousand times over.

A small moth fluttered down and then across Showman's vision. Following it in a moment of surreal daze, he traced its path up, up, upto a glint in a high perch among stone and gaping former windows. On pure instinct, he pushed his companion and their rescued woman down into a brittle pile of blackened bones; their snapping was overshadowed by the crack of that distant rifle and by the whizzing impact of its fired bullet. Quickly untying himself, Cade picked up the frail woman and bolted alongside him toward cover.

"How did you see that coming?" Cade asked, choosing a broken nearby entrance.

"Just lucky," Showman replied, his heart hammering in his chest. Another impact popped off bits of stone nearby, but at an angle the previous sniper could never have made. That meant *there was more than one.* "Who are they?!"

Cade shook his head. "We have to come up with a plan. They'll be watching our bikes; an obvious place to shoot us. But if we can feint like we're running for it, maybe we can grab them and ride out of here while they're moving to intercept."

Moving quickly, they found another exit from the building. "Sorry about this," Cade said, taking back his jacket. The injured woman lifted her arms, but didn't seem to be aware that she was losing her only semblance of real clothing. Showman looked away politely as Cade removed the garment and threw it out the exitonly to have it pierced by a bullet before it even hit the ground.

"Christ." Picking up a piece of glass from a broken mirror in what looked like the lobby of a former hotel, the other man angled it at the edge of the door to scan the nearby heights. "One two five. I see five."

"What *is* this?" Showman demanded of their unseen ambushers. "Seriously, what's happening? Why do they have a sniper trap set up in a dead city on a civilized world we haven't made contact with so far off the safe paths?"

Cade began picking up various pieces of debris and testing them for strength. "We'll worry about all that later." He found a large span of metal, handed it over, and then began looking for another. "Our only chance now is to shield ourselves and run for that rift."

Showman looked to their mumbling shock victim. "And her?"

Cade sighed. "I don't know. I honestly don't. Trying to guide her along would make us sitting ducksbut then again, we don't know if she's in any danger. There's a good chance they're just after men like you and me."

"They think we're soldiers?"

"We *were* on military bikes, and I've got this damn rifle on my back. The wife hates guns; I should have listened."

"But who are they fighting?" Wary of windows for fear of being shot, Showman did his best to peer up and down the devastated street. His heart sank as he heard the approach of several engines; his hopes truly died as he saw who was coming to find them. "Grey Riders!"

"How many?" Cade asked, settling on a second large piece of metal debris.

He counted as quickly as he could, trying to make his count accurate. "Fifteen. All on bikes."

"They've left us alone for so long, I thought they were men of honor. Are they shooting at anything that moves now?" Cade wondered aloud, suddenly furious. "Bastards. That clinches it. We're not leaving her behind."

Thinking of the easy escape in his pocket, Showman fought down a sense of cornered panic and asked, "What's the plan, then?"

His well-muscled companion lifted their wounded woman right up. "We all run together. You shield all three of us."

He steeled himself for the ordeal ahead. "What if the snipers have us in sight from more than one direction?"

"Then we'll just have to rely on more of that luck of yours," Cade replied, already heading back toward the entrance they'd first used. "Ready?"

Taking a deep breath, he nodded.

"Go!"

They stuck close to the wall. Showman ran alongside, holding his long piece of metal out before them. Maybe they wouldn't

a horribly loud *ping* nearly knocked the shielding debris from his hand before the crack from the gun was even audible, but he clutched harder and ran with adrenaline-fueled focus as a second and third bullet ricocheted from metal opposite his head.

A glint shone from the left as they reached the corner and their bikes; he swung the shield around, *ping*, swung it back as the firing crack echoed*ping,* and another crack. How long had it taken between each shot? Every moment seemed to drag on eternally as he dropped his thick piece of metal, donned his helmet, kicked his bike off, and rode after Cade, who more or less had their rescued woman curled over the handlebars. It was a dangerously imbalanced riding position, but, one way or another, they wouldn't need it for long.

A crack and a burst of wind marked a bullet flying over his shoulder. He shuddered, but hit the gas harder; the rift approached ahead as they sped across the flattened park. Like the opaque rip they had seen earlier that morning, this one was also closed enough to hide what lay beyond, and, because Cade had given his away, he pulled out his own rift compass to open the path.

His helmet radio crackled with a strangely robotic voice. **Stop, you'll kill us all.**

He actually laughed, since it was clear they were going to get away if the enemy was trying something like *that*but the impetus of his thumb stopped just over the rift compass. What had Cade said? That it was *like someone had dropped fire on this city?* From the center, it was now obvious where the flames had come from.

Cade realized it, too. "My god"

Showman came to a stop alongside him and just before the ground zero rift. What else could he do? He held the rift compass high. "I'll do it! I swear I'll unleash whatever's on the other side if you don't back off!"

The emotionless radio response came with less urgency this time. **Or we could just shoot you.**

"We can't be killed, remember?" he yelled at the echoing and apparently empty city square. "You'll never stop me from pressing this button."

Cade grinned a bit maniacally. "Yes. The only defense we have." He let down his carried woman and put her behind him as fifteen Grey Riders approached on bikes. The first fourteen rolled to surround them, but Showman held his makeshift detonator high and resisted oncoming hyperventilation from the stress of feeling the invisible reticles of all those guns on him.

The fifteenth and final Grey Rider approached on foot. He was larger than the others, though under his black helmet and bulky uniform it was hard to say whether it was some sort of armor or not. Showman recalled everything Edgar had guessed about this personthat it was secretly that woman that had destroyed the First World singlehandedly, and that she was an unstoppable force of madness. Whether or not that was true, this Rider's markings were clear: this was the Grey Leader, first in command of the entire force. That led to one obvious question: why was the first in command of that entire anonymous and vicious organization *here?*

	<TEXT> He was young again, and vulnerable. Houses towered; streets coursed. Nobody had any idea what was coming, and he had no name, for even his own identity had not yet formed. In these moments, the world was malleable and full of opportunitiesand so was he, not that he'd had any idea back then. While his friends vanished like so much smoke, his demon-eyed and grizzled son of a bitch father stalked into the alley and grabbed the joint from his hand. "Fool boy. You'll ruin your life with this kinda thing. Can't you just *pretend* to fit in? Smile. Come to church. Stop runnin' with this crowd. I don't know how to get through to ya." The old man raised a hand, but then thought better of it. "Nah, would break your mother's heart were she still here, God bless her soul."

These were sentiments he'd heard before, but he'd finally had enough. The raging energies of a teenage body spat from his hands and lashed out. Pushing, he screamed, "I don't belong here!"

While his old man staggered, he ran. Was it Brisbane then? Or had that come later? It was all a blur now, full of youthful blunders and victories he could never apologize for. None of that existed anymore.

He sat on a dock with a girl whose name he'd lost long ago. It had been late then, past midnight, and she had been another runaway with nowhere else to go. Banding together had been important; of course, that was not the only reason he'd been there. This night, she was just a shadow, and he was slowly grasping more of his waking self with a sense of despair. He had been innocent then, but not now, and he could literally feel that purity drain from him moment to moment the closer he drifted toward waking.

This night, his companion on the dock was just a shadow; this night, a phantasmal light glimmered into existence to his left. He watched it for a moment, fixated, as the chilly green point grew into a small rapidly fluctuating ring of fractally perpendicular emerald. It was beautiful, haunting, and wholly out of place. On a hunch, he asked, "Hello?"

Showman awoke to a stinging bruise on his forehead. Sitting up abruptly among the other layabouts next to the fence where they'd all more or less fallen after an intense day's work, he looked around with dismay. The pebble that had hit him rolled down his shirt. It had come from no discernible sourcemaybe kicked up by a truck passing on the dirt roadand it had somehow flown twenty-odd meters and clocked him. He could already tell that it was going to be one of those days.

As it often did, the demoralization of his dream lingered, but he sighed and adjusted his manner to feign positivity as he walked. This was one lesson he *had* learned from his old man; to himself and to Murphy's demon sitting on his shoulder, he whispered, "The show must go on."

The cold morning light was still in its grey phase, for he was up far earlier than he'd intended, but there was no going back to sleep with all the soreness of heavy farm work pulsating at the extremities of his awareness. They put him to work wherever he went, be it insect tunnels or snow-dusted farms, and he was secretly astonished that the first thing every society in need did was politely enslave its men.  He understood it, and did not rail against it with any great loathing, but it seemed the default mode of every community he'd drifted through in his life was *behave by our rules or leave.* For the moment, as was his role, he behaved by the rules.

Eleven trees stood at the far end of field B-11, and rarely used laborer-worn paths went close enough to make both approach and exit unassuming. Among the shrubs and trunks, there ran a clearing that could not be seen from outside, and here he found two equally overworked and dirty men already present. He stopped short and asked, "Why so early?"

"Could ask the same of you," one replied petulantly.

The other was far grimmer. "Word is the Zkirax pulled the trigger. Everyone in the tunnels is dead."

At this, Showman felt heat and discomfort run involuntarily up his limbs. "I thought we had more time."

"We all did, mate."

"Those bastard insects actually did it."

He turned his head away from them as he suffered a moment of mortal stress. He'd been a laborer in those tunnels just like he was a laborer here, and, in those orange-lit recesses, nobody had told him the truth about the Zkirax alliance. What were they not telling him now? He turned back to them. "What's that?"

The grimmer man lifted a crumpled paper full of innocuous symbols that would have looked like nothing more than a crude map to anyone not in the know. "Orders from higher up. It'll soon be time to act."

"Fair dinkum," the other added, nodding.

Not wanting to believe it, Showman shook his head instinctively. "How do you know they're real? My gut's on the Ghost Council being dead, true dead, same as the rest of the First Tribe. They've been silent since we left."

"Well they're not silent anymore."

"Sure, maybe. At the time it all made sense, too. But what do we really know about them now? The way this is done, we can't even be sure they're the same ones as before. Who *are* they?

"Just some people who also thought the idea of letting a teenage boy run an alliance with aliens was an absurd idea. Doesn't matter to me if the particulars switch out."

For that, he had no direct reply. Deep in his core, he knew what was coming. Something in him had pulled away from all this, and the community he'd thought had finally been right for him had now turned into yet another mire from which he had to carefully extract himself. "And how will we do this if we can't kill each other? Throw dangerous people in a pit somewhere?"

"Nah, they'd get out. We'll have to have dismemberment crews that'll keep them in pieces daily so they can't cause trouble. It's sickening, but necessary."

He suppressed a horrified shiver and pretended to nod in agreement. "Sounds like it's been thought out. What's Pixley got to say about all this?"

"She's a lousy drunk," one man countered. "Who cares?"

"No way to reach her, anyhow," the other said with a more level-headed tone. "There are questions of loyalty going around, and whether us being unable to die changes things. It's unclear who's in charge anymore, and whether any of this is necessary. I say those questions will be easier to figure out with us on one side of the line rather than the other, if you catch my meaning."

Showman took a step back. His compatriots reacted poorly, and, always aware of his own personal show, he stepped forward again. "Then let me get to Pixley. Let's just get her word on it, alright? I can be back in a single day."

"That so?"

"It is."

"Fair chops, then. We'll wait."

Backing away and nodding, he looked both of them in the eye to ascertain their sincerity. They would waitthe challenge now was going on this supposed supply run's return trip sooner than planned. Scanning the fields that were only just then beginning to fill with laborers both alive and dead, he slipped out of the grove and onto the track without attracting even a single glance. Eventually joining the deeper flow of people along the main road, he headed toward where Edgar and his men were camped.

He still considered it a stroke of luck that his original assignment to befriend a farming system's head engineer had somehow led him to a trusted position with one of the region's big movers and shakers, and Edgar certainly didn't suspect in the least, but something about all this was starting to weigh on his soul. Humanity was surviving better than anyone had projectedthe inability to die notwithstandingand the hard choices were being met with solidarity and ingenuity rather than pyrrhic sacrifice. Men like Edgar were putting on a show of confidence and leading the way, while men like Neil were working hard in support to make those efforts succeed. Lying to them felt increasingly wrong.

He squeezed his arm muscles as he walked. Tilling frozen fields, building fences, and hauling materials was backbreaking work, but in some manner he relished the penitence. Concord farm was an amazing gem in a vast wilderness that was otherwise shit house. If nothing else, that very pregnant Casey deserved loyalty and contribution for what she had founded here. Speaking ofhe nodded to her eldest son in passing, and he smiled and nodded back. He was a good kid, and a few years younger than the *teenage boy* in charge of the alliance back home that the others had disparaged. Maybe it was that youthful eagerness and honesty that the aliens had trusted; the inner despair and loneliness of true adulthood had not yet found boys like them.

Or maybe they'd had great parents.

His father was too far away in distance and time to hear him, so he whispered the words out loud to himself: "I have to tell Edgar what's about to happen, don't I?"

On his shoulder, the demon of bad luck disagreed. At that moment, his shirt caught on the edge of the rear bumper of a passing truck, and he stumbled backwards with it during a disorienting series of embarrassed moments. Passersby either stared in surprise or laughed until he freed his shirt and tumbled against the soft grassy bank next to the road and away from the crowd.

From his prone position on the grass, he could hear men speaking in hushed tones.

"I don't like the way the Lifers treat us either, but it's only natural, right? Look at your head wound. It's disgusting."

"This isn't even what killed me. I got this injury saving a Lifer from an errant spider from that forest over there. And I'm not talking about how they look at us. I'm talking about a slave class that seems to be emerging. We aren't fed or protected from the elements, and yet we work day in and day out."

A third voice joined in. "I *have* been thinking about that."

"Right? Thus the plan. We don't necessarily have to hurt many people. It would just be better for all of us if one of us were in charge."

"But how? They'd never let us just take"

"We outnumber them two to one. We just wait and watch for a good opportunity."

"Yeah, but how many of us are in on this?"

The reply came with an undercurrent of anger: "Most of us here at Concord. If I say the word"

With a guarded expression, Showman rose.

Five dead men turned and stared at him.

He raised his hands. "You guys don't have to do that."

Three men stepped forward, but two held them back. "This guy's a friend of the dead. He's never treated us any different. And remember that dead engineer who helped in the fields? They came in together."

"We did!" he continued, trying to think quickly. "Just wait. Look, no matter what it feels like, there is no difference between the living and the dead. You guys will regenerate and be alive again, and we will die to hunger, cold, and violence. It's a cycle. Come on. You know they'll hear your concerns, because we're one and the same. We need you guys."

Wary eyes regarded him as their owners considered his words.

"Just wait," he said again. "Please don't throw a coup or something. Just a few days, alright? We'll figure this all out!" He looked to the side, racing for any shred of inspiration. "Wait! I know! I'm headed to the Waystation right now, and I'll be back in a day. I'll bring someone who can fix all this."

The leader revealed himself by speaking. "Oh yeah? Who's that?"

"A very important person," he lied with as much sincerity as he could. "I can't say anything now. Just trust me. We've worked together in the fields. You know me. We can figure this out without violence. Yeah?"

Four men looked to the one with the hardest eyes, the one who had spoken with collective righteous anger. Now, though, his voice was diplomatic and guarded. "You'll be back in a day?"

"A day! I'm heading there right now."

The lead man moved his half-hanging jaw as he mulled over the idea, but, before he could agree or disagree, screams erupted from down the road. In an instant, Showman joined men both alive and dead in a concerned rush toward the gates of Concord farm.

A crowd had already gathered, and many were screaming or crying. In their midst, a wounded and exhausted woman lay repeating, "They're all dead. Everyone in the Zkirax tunnels is dead."

"I left my family there!" someone screamed.

Others pushed forward. "Are they *being eaten?*"

"Did you see it?"

"Why would they do that?! We're allies!"

"How did you escape?"

"I knew we couldn't trust those damn bugs."

Showman looked to his left and right, but the rebellious dead men had vanished into the growing crowd. A chill wind blew in under the blue early morning sunlight, and he wondered how many things could go wrong at onceon his shoulder, Murphy's demon grinned, and the ground trembled ever so slightly. He wasn't sure he'd really felt it or whether it was the result of the masses pouring in to hear the news.

Where would Edgar be right now? He slipped his way through the sea of horrified faces and ran down the road toward the main buildings. In short order, he caught sight of a circle of men and women outside the central farmhouse. Pushing in, he managed to reach the second row and get a good vantage on a table in the center with a crude map spread on it.

Casey stood with her pregnant belly touching the edge; she used a stick to point at various objects. "The titan beast will be here within the hour"

Titan beast? His question was answered by another tremor beneath his shoes. This was definitely one of those days, and everything *was* going wrong at once! Heart pounding, he scanned the circles of onlookers and found Edgar about ninety degrees to his rightbut he also caught sight of his own living compatriots and the dead men who had spoken of rebellion. There were two groups here considering violent uprising, and it looked like their opportunity had arisen. He caught as many hard gazes as he could and subtly shook his head.

A runner arrived. "The Zkirax! They've killed everyone in their tunnels!"

The crowd began to splinter into chaos and questions, but Casey shouted them down. "**Pay attention!** There's nothing we can do about that right now!" Her motherly anger immediately brought quiet and discipline. "We have multiple objectives and very little time. According to radio reports, two beasts are approachingone smaller, one very big. We cannot allow them to pass through here, or they'll destroy everything simply by rolling over it. In front of these beasts are a mess of creatures of all sorts. Those we'll have to fight or endure. The beasts, though, will have to be diverted around us somehow."

One woman asked, "How big are they?"

"By reports, one's roughly the size of a mountain," Casey answered. "The bigger one is"

"*That's the smaller one?*" someone shouted.

She continued unperturbed. "The bigger one blocked the whole horizon; full size unknown."

"Christ!"

"What'll we do?"

"How can we resist anything that big?"

"We have to run!"

Showman stood on his toes and peered down. It looked like his compatriots and the rebellious dead men were reaching for weapons at their hips. He shook his head a little more this time and made sure to catch their eyes for a warning glare amidst the confusion.

Casey stomped her foot. "Be quiet!"

Silence fell. Those men who had reached for weaponsboth alive and deadstealthily backed down.

"Think about it," she said, locking eyes with those comprising the innermost circle. "Why would there be a smaller version of the same kind of beast?"

Showman looked over as Edgar spoke. "Uh, it's a baby?"

"Exactly," Casey said. "And where baby goes"

"so goes the parent," Edgar finished, his eyes widening. "We need to distract the baby."

"Yes." The determined redhead donned a grim frown and regarded those around her. "Volunteers will have to take trucks, and anything we can spare that makes noise or light. Your main task will be to draw the smaller beast as far to the side as you can." She sighed. "It's unlikely you'll survive."

Despite that, a dozen men and women stepped forward immediately.

"Go," she ordered, her eyes memorizing each of their faces as they nodded and ran toward the trucks.

Suddenly left with a much smaller crowdmost of which were on the verge of violence in search of powerShowman shivered. How did these people deal with so many threats from so many different directions without losing it?

"That brings us to our second objective," Casey said, tracing her stick along the map. "These things roll right across rough terrain. Forests, hills, mountainsthey're no impediment. The lookouts say they squeeze right through the rifts, too. Once they're past here, they'll reach the Waystation by noon, and there are no alternate paths to divert the beasts there. The Waystation will be destroyed unless we can warn them and give them a chance to figure something out." She stood a little taller as her husband approached at a jog with a motorbike rolling under either hand. "You all know my husband, Cade."

He ran up to the group and stopped, breathless, his long dark hair unkempt. "Two working bikes are all I could find on short notice." It was his turn to look at the others and speak. "The beasts are faster than us, so we'll never make it if we take the same route." He took a deep breath and then pointed at the map with his fingers. "Look here. We've all been moving along a narrow twisting strand of safe realities; knowledge that was paid for in blood." He nodded toward Edgar, who turned his gaze down respectfully. "The Zkirax are here, Concord's here, and the Waystation is at the end. All these threats have been using our paths. It's *us.* We're their markers for safety. That's why the smaller one might follow our volunteers." He shook his head. "But it also means we're going to have to cut through dangerous territory to reach the Waystation before the big one does. I've only got two bikes; I need one volunteer."

Casey glowered. "Two volunteers."

Cade stood his ground. "I can't ask someone else to do this in my place."

"I can!" she shouted, before reaching up and pulling him away from the group by the ear to continue their heated conversation in hushed tones.

As Showman looked on in surprise, a bird flew down, tussled in Edgar's long hair, and then darted away. Confused and pushed out of the circle, he looked over sheepishly as Casey and Cade saw his movement. As if prompted by the surrounding gazes upon him, Edgar reached into his pocket and pulled out two sets of crystal-latticed amethyst pyramids. "These, uh, might ensure your husband's safety."

The two farm owners discussed their use in private for a minute or two, and then Cade looked to the group. "I'm going. I need one volunteer."

Conspirators alive and dead turned their heads; he'd already promised to do this. Showman gulped and raised his hand. "Me. I'll do it."

Edgar came over and pressed one of the small crystalline-encased gemstone in his hand. "We don't have many of these, so use it only if you have to; and get there safe. You know I'd go with you"

Showman shook his head. "I know you would, mate, and I know you can't right now. It's too important you stay here." He wanted to say more about the threats from within, but both groups were standing close and listening hard. "Watch your back."

"I will." At a loss for deeper words, Edgar just forced out, "Please get word to Mona before it's too late. And Neil."

"I will." After clasping his friend's arm, he took a cue from Cade and dashed over to the bikes. Time was of the essence.

"Know how to ride?" the other man asked. "Probably should have mentioned that as a requirement first."

Feeling simultaneously threatened on all sides and that he'd somehow managed to navigate the eye of a precarious impossible needle, Showman grinned. "I've ridden a bit before." He donned his helmet and took off at speed.

Delivered by radio, Cade's voice echoed in his ears. "Let's head to alternate rift J. The fastest route cuts through Her Glory's side of the territory."

"Right." Relearning movement at speed after so long on foot, he raced by workers on the morning-lit main dirt road as they looked on with envy.

Cade moved up alongside him. "The terrain's going to be roughtoo rough for trucksbut we can't slow down. We're barely going to make it as it is."

Showman glanced over and saw the heavy assault rifle on the other man's back. "Whoah, you know how to use that thing?"

"I've shot a bit before," Cade replied, chuckling. "And the wife will kill me if I don't come back alive."

The fields passed by in a blur, and they angled off the main refugee path toward a different reading on their small navigation chips. Through lightly packed trees, they approached a gently pulsing rift surrounded by warning markers whose colors and patterns denoted toxic air.

Cade radioed, "Don't slow down. The next rift is maybe three minutes away at speed. Think you can hold your breath?"

Showman breathed deep in preparation. "I'll try."

"Keep a look out, too. We won't be able to radio each other in warning."

"Right."

"Here we go," Cade said as the rift came up on them. "Non-stop from here on out."

An inward hiss of air followed, and Showman took as deep a breath as he could before blasting cyan and yellow fog threatened to blank out his visor. Having stuck to the safe paths for so long, he'd almost forgotten how deadly random realities could be. In this region, there was a good chance of hitting one of the numerous realities Her Glory had long ago terraformed and scoured of dangers, but the Devastation had also thrust a bevy of horrors into the mix. This one hosted completely flat rock devoid of any signs of lifethe horrific atmosphere had made certain of that. Angling his rapidly rotating front tire, he kept Cade's bike directly before him and slightly to the side.

It might have been his imagination, but he thought he saw lumpier thicknesses among the alien atmosphere. They thrust close from the left and right, ever just failing to reach the two riders, and he pressed his mouth closed harder as his head began to pound. How long had it been? He'd failed to count from the start, and now every second seemed an eternity as his awareness began to constrict and his lungs began to burn for breath. He began to count, but the effort only seemed to highlight the tremendous amount of time remaining. Eleven twelve thirteen his body was already trying to force him to breathe. 

The neon air ahead thinned, and the world briefly opened up on either side. Their high flat ridge had been shaped by strange forces long ago; flanking valleys were equally geometric, angled, and flat-surfaced. It was rock, to be sure, but it could easily have been the smooth metal hull of a battleship for its shape. Along these flawlessly polished mirrors of stone, waves of thicker cyan and yellow gas *definitely* moved toward them.

The pain in his chest forgotten, Showman hit the gas to maintain top speed just behind Cade. With a spike of inner defiance, he resolved to asphyxiate before letting those strange faceless entities anywhere near his lungs. The thought of remaining perpetually dead because one of those gas *things* had taken up residence in his alveoli was simply too much to bear.

But his vision still began to tunnel down to a single point. How deep into this fuzzy mental mire was too far? He kept one hand steering while the other reached down for that emergency teleportation gemstone. This seemed too soon; he knew he would regret giving up now. If they didn't make it to the Waystation in time, they'd have no warning. Neil and Kumari would be right in danger's path. Neil could probably take care of himself, but he couldn't handle the thought of that little baby being

Fixated on the back of Cade's bike, he almost tumbled off his own as the awesome vastness of a domed sky afire with the blue and orange of dawn exploded across his awareness. Lifting his visor briefly, he gasped in sweet air and let his senses de-fuzz as higher ridges raced by on his right and a low valley floor of ancient trees rotated at a much slower pace than the blazing ground beneath his front tire. The rubber bounced mightily on various lumpy rocks at times, but a well-tuned suspension kept his ride steady and functional.

Cade pointed, and they remained on the high path to curve around the valley. Showman took a few dangerous glances around; this place reminded him of the Waystation's terrain in many ways. Despite so many realities being lethal or horrifying, it was still a beautiful wonder that the other side of the coin lay out here, too. The Earth, bastion of life, provider of untold expanses where human beings could breathe and eat and sleep and build homes againhe supposed humanity had evolved to fit this region and not the other way around, but it was still a marvel that any of this existed at all when the multiverse was as mean as cat's piss otherwise.

The next rift came and went, and they emerged into a thick morass of heavy dark trees and low teal bushes where the going was rough. Getting down off their bikes, the two men began slashing their way through the worst of it. Checking his rift compass, Showman saw that the next rift was only about eight hundred meters aheadbut at the rate they were progressing through the tangle, it would take all day.

A shout came from ahead, where movement and color soon made itself known.

"Hello?" Cade shouted.

Several families began to emerge from the teal undergrowth; two groups looked Indian, and the other three Chinese, but none spoke English. While Cade tried to communicate, Showman realized with some shock that there were likely other exoduses happening all over this nurturing Earth; families on other continents were making their way through beautiful lands, exotic dangers, and new settlements in distant parallel. No radio, no internet, and no boatsthey were separated not just by the walls of each reality, but by oceans and kilometers.

Hundreds of billions. In a flash, he understood. *Hundreds of billions of people.* That's where they all wereall around the globe, on every continent and island, moving into an ever-increasing number of Earths. That was also why they actually had a shot at survival. Places like Concord farm didn't have to feed hundreds of billionsthey just had to feed the small fraction of those who were coming through both that reality and that area of the planet. While his own journey had taken him physically halfway across North America, that had just been to reach each successive rift. While these wanderers had somehow made it to another continent entirely, it was definitely possible that there were people out there spiraling through the multiverse while staying fairly close to home. Might then people back home in Australia

"Come on," Cade said, interrupting his thoughts. Sweat streamed down the other man's face, matting his long black hair to his neck. "It's strangely hot here. I don't like it. Let's not waste any time."

"Right." He began chopping his way forward again, this time assisted by twenty-odd people shouting positive support with words he didn't understand. Something about their efforts seemed charged with energy, and he could only guess at what they might have seen on this world. Pushing through to the tangle closest to the rift in only a few minutes, he regarded it with some surprise.

It hung as a long rip in the air like the others, but it did not show a new world beyond. Instead, it seemed to be a warped and semi-transparent optical illusion, like space itself was scabbing over. Cade fiddled with his rift compass and the spatial scab began to deepen and give way to sights beyond, but the implication was still deeply disturbing. The natural rifts had certainly been aggravated and made great in number by the sheer force of the Devastation; were some now healing? 

One of the women practically shrieked *dhanyavad! dhanyavad!* while the rest of the families surged forward.

"Wait!" Cade shouted, his gaze jumping between the heavy rains beyond and the markers someone had set up to either side. He ran to the makeshift stone and wood and picked at faint signs of chalk. "The colors have worn off for some reason. We don't know what's in there!"

But they didn't understand, and, too, they seemed to be eager for any escape from the forest of teal bushes and dark trees. Cade pressed his rift compass into the hand of the woman that was still gripping his arm and thanking him. "Use this to open rifts. We have a second one. We'll be fine. Get to safety, alright?"

She seemed to vaguely get what he meant, and she ran after the others. Showman watched her ragged shoes rise and fall on the leafy ground until she disappeared into the rain. Lightning flashed ominous red against the torrent, and he looked over to Cade at the same time as the other man also realized they had no choice. Together, they pushed their bikes forward and followed the five families into the deluge.

His helmet only barely helping his visibility, Showman kept the visor half up and the backs of the women and children ahead in his sight. "Are we burning time?"

"This is still the fastest path to the Waystation," Cade shouted back. "I just don't like this at all."

"Too right." He looked to his left as red light flashed against the dark morning rains a second time. The boom that followed was odd and shriekish. "What the hell is that?"

Cade had no answer, especially not as strobing white flashes followed; as they slogged through shallow mud and deepening puddles in the chill damp, it became clear that the lightshow and thunder in the distance was chaotic, tremendousand stationary. "I'm not sure it's a danger," he finally said after a red shriek passed, his tone curious. "Something's definitely going on over there, but" He ducked down as the light finally made itself known; a beam of pure demon red sliced overhead and into a hill to their right. The searing noise it brought was nearly deafening, but the families ahead needed no prompting to start running for their lives.

The rain slowed to a drizzle as the heat and winds brought by the attack billowed the clouds away. Something full of light, machinery, and insanity was now visible on the horizon, but Showman didn't dare pause long enough to get a good look. As Cade immediately jumped on his bike, he did the same.

"Our cover's blown!" Cade shouted. "We have to ride ahead to distract that thing away from these people!"

Stepping on the gas with the gripping sense that a gigantic red laser was about to obliterate him at any moment, Showman raced past the terrified families and into scant drizzle. Cade remained slightly ahead, and, for several heart-frozen moments, the two men braved the open air with silence and anticipation.

The red beam did come again, but it shot harmlessly off into the sky.

White flashes followed, now visible as strobing flak, but it, too, was aimed at nothing.

The two men didn't slow, but it was not a ruse. Whatever installation, base, machine, or unknown threat lay on that horizon, it had gone haywire before they had ever arrived in its vicinity. More than that, the angle was too low for that beam to actually strike where they were riding.

Cade looked back, but his sigh came in over Showman's helmet radio. "We can't spare time to go back. They'll be fine."

The red and white effulgent chaos continued throughout the ride, and it was Showman's turn to look back as they rode through the next rift. Direct threats were one thing, but what had *that* been about?

Another rift came and went before they began seeing the bodies. They weren't dead, of course, but they'd been too badly incinerated to move. White healthy eyes looked out from charred skulls. Seared meat gave way to blackened bones. Grilled lungs expanded and shrank slowly. Some of the corpses lifted weak hands in askance, but Cade looked away in pain. Showman decided it was best not to ask if they should do anythingthese people had been burned somewhere, wandered here, and fallen, and there was nothing he or his companion could do for them right now.

Yet another rift brought them to something Showman had thought never to see again: buildings rose high into the late morning light ahead, glinting wonderfully for all their promise. It was only upon closer approach that they found scorched earth spreading in every direction, and it was only as the light shifted that it became clear that the city skyscrapers had been gutted by fire. Only their mirrored tops remained; a cruel illusion for those in the distance. Here among low blackened hills and the skeletal frameworks of ruined houses, there could be no doubt this place was dead.

Unhappily, Showman asked, "Is this an Amber World?"

"Can't be," Cade responded, his voice low and stricken. "It's gotta be a sister Earth, or maybe one of ours that got ejected." He brought his bike to a stop. "Oh shit!"

Showman curved around roughly and managed to stop close enough to ask, "What?"

Cade began shining a flashlight frantically down at himself, his bike, and the ground. After finding nothing, he relaxed and put a hand to his helmet. "That's right, they permanently sealed the ones infected with GLORWOC."

A moment of horrified revulsion came over Showman, and he checked himself the same way despite Cade's reassurance. "You're sure?"

"Yeah. Even if those worlds were out here, we could never access them."

That was a relief; he began to kick off and follow Cade again, but something dinged his helmet. He glanced down in surprise to see a pebble rolling down and off his thigh. Looking up and around in confusion, he thought of his secret third companion, that demon of bad luck he'd hoped he'd left behind at Concord for the day. It was purely imaginary, sure, but he couldn't shake the image of a puffy purple little shit grinning and torturing him with small pranks as it floated around with nothing better to do. He clenched his fists, but found nothing of the sort in the surrounding air. Rather, he sighted something else in the distance.

She was as ashen as the earth itself. Her uneven footsteps took her stumbling across still-smoldering chunks of wood and dangerously near remnant flames. Through distorted heat coronas, he thought he saw her mumbling to herself.

"Cade."

His companion turned and saw her. "Christ." He turned to check the assorted supplies in his bike's compartments, but none contained a blanket. Instead, he removed his jacket. "Guard here, will you?"

"Right." Showman removed his helmet and scanned the tortured landscape as the other man ran out onto half-molten hillocks and augmented the woman's tattered clothing with his jacket. It took a good three minutes for Cade to guide her back; as he surveyed the widespread ravages, Showman nurtured a growing sense of unease. Something terrible had happened here, and not in the usual uncaring and monstrous way. This city and its suburbs had not fallen victim to the myriad natural dangers of the multiversethis had unmistakably been the fallout of war.

The woman didn't seem to realize they were with her. With Cade's help, she took shaky steps toward the bikes, but she continued to mumble to herself in traumatized and urgent tones.

"What's she saying?"

Cade shook his head. "Another foreign language speaker." While she muttered and stared around wide-eyed at random, he wiped grey ash from her face to reveal heat-pinked skin. He made an attempt at cleaning her short wind-ripped hair, but the grey had been pressed too deep. "I think she was near the blast that destroyed this place. It must have been terrible." He seemed to retreat inside himself for a moment of despair.

Showman sat taller as something occurred to him. It wasn't as scary as GLORWOC, but it was still potentially nightmarish. "Was it nuclear? Is this place full of radiation?"

"Can't be sure," Cade said, snapping back to awareness. "But best we get out of here either way. Help me get her on here?"

Together, they made her climb on behind Cade, a task which she absently performed without excessive trouble. She was in shock, but not completely mindless. Showman removed his belt, tied her to his companion by the waist, and retreated to his own bike. He was more than happy to get moving again.

---

I had the obvious crisis any civilized person might; for days, I agonized over whether to warn my boss that she was about to be brutally assaulted by my partners in crime. Despite numerous rationalizations, excuses, and mental playbacks of the death of Well-dressed Prick, some part of me knew something would happen this time, too. Somehow or another, she would end up dead if the attack went through. It was a premonition I couldn't shake, and I downed coffee after coffee while debating what to do.

At one time, I had liked and respected her. She'd been incredibly convincing. She was a single mom with five kids, and we'd had a drink after my first office Christmas party. In that late private hour, we'd talked like normal people, she'd told me about her struggles and stress, and I'd believed her. That conversation remained with me as an internal excuse for her behavior for the next several years.

There were constant requests for unpaid overtime, extra work, or favors. I did all of these with a sense of pride, for what man could refuse a woman in such need? It felt like we were a secret team, like I had a responsibility greater than those my coworkers held. Of course, I felt a little weird when a new intern quit because of *all the extra unpaid work.* I hadn't seen any of that, and I wondered: was she asking him for favors, too? Had it somehow been kept secret from me?

My confusion turned to bitter fury when I decided to leave at nine at night instead of staying until my extra work was done. I didn't go homeI visited a few bars she had mentioned over the years. At the fifth and final one, I found her.

I sat in my car and watched through the windows of the place. It was a high class establishment, and she stood laughing with a few girlfriends, a dainty drink in hand. Her dress was form-fitting and fantasticthis was not at all the tired and stressed single mom I'd been sold. It might have been crossing the line, but I knew her address from mail at work, and I drove by her place while she was out. The lights were on and someone was home.

I knocked.

The door swung open a minute later to reveal a haggard thirty-something man and a cluster of screaming and boisterous children. "Can I help you?"

"Oh, I'm sorry," I told him. "I was looking for Lying Bitch. She told me to bring her some documents for tomorrow's presentation."

"She's not here," he replied with a sigh. "She's at work until late again."

I could have told him then, but I didn't think it was my place at the time. Instead I made polite small talk until the truth came out: these were his kids. He had been a single father of five after their mother had died, and Lying Bitch was a supposed *stable and hard-working new wife* that I later noted had come around right after a large life insurance settlement.

Once I knew, her lies unraveled daily. After every single claim she made, I dug a little deeper, and I found that she did literally no work in any area of her life. Her dynasty was an invisible pyramid of secret overtime and personal favors; each man was separated from the others to ensure nobody would ever put two and two together. Her home life was nonexistent; she drank, partied, and went home with strangers under the guise of working late hours to support her new family.

And she utterly despised me once I slowly stopped accepting her requests. Rumors began circulating about me at the office, a promotion passed me over, and I kept ending up in the worst projects. She never said a single word to me directly, and the old me with the wool over his eyes would have just chalked it up to bad luck, but I knew. This woman was a demon of lies that sucked the life out of everyone around her.

But did she deserve to die?

I sat at my desk drinking coffee and going over and over her supposed crimes. Nothing she'd done was illegal in the strictest sense, and I could certainly destroy her life simply by shedding light on her pyramid of lies, but there were consequences to consider. First, that she had no real skills other than manipulation. If her life was torn to shreds, how would she support herself? Would she go through the long and arduous process of self-discovery and learning to stand on her own two feet, or would she just spin a new web? Second, she could likely take me down with her. There would be no hiding my identity if I approached multiple people and clued them in. I might even come off as a strange stalker.

As the days wore on and Tom and Jake observed her and began putting together a plan, I felt the decision slowly being made for me. If I was to spare her this fate, I needed to choose. The day of the planned assault, a direct conversation felt in order.

I entered her office with a binder casually in hand. "Hey Lying Bitch, mind if we talk?"

"Sure," she said with a smile that I knew to be fake, but which was otherwise perfect. "Sit."

I sat.

She leaned slightly forward. "What's up?"

Approaching what was really on my mind in a roundabout way, I said, "I noticed I've been sort of stagnating where I'm at. My performance reviews have been very good, so I've been wondering if there's anything else I can do to get back on top."

Sighing, she leaned back against her chair. "I didn't want to say anything, but you haven't exactly been a team player lately. People are starting to talk about it."

Suppressing an inner rush of anger, I put on a politely confused face. "Really? What's the problem? I've done everything officially asked of me."

"Ah, a real workplace is a bit more than official," she explained. "Official projects are just the minimum to get by. To really be part of the team, you have to take on more than just the minimum."

I faked my best understanding nod. "I *was* doing that my first few years here."

"You were," she responded, leaning forward again. "What changed?"

I couldn't help it. "When I was working unpaid overtime one night, I went home to get something, and I saw your car at a bar. You were in there drinking."

To her credit, her face didn't twitch a bit. "What I do in my personal time is none of your business. I hope that's all you did, or I'll have no qualms about informing HR that you're harassing me."

"Harassing you?" My anger mixed with amusement. She was an expert predator in the ecosystem in which she had evolved, but I had a secret advantage. Real violence cut through bullshit red tape and pathetic reputation games. "Not at all, Lying Bitch. I just happen to know what really goes on here. I've run into other guys doing unpaid overtimewhich is against company policy by the wayand I even ran into your husband at the grocery store. Many things you say don't add up."

Her mask finally fell away, and I saw pure evil there. She stood, came around her desk, and stood above me with flared eyes. "Fine, dispense with the games. What do you want for your silence? Money? A promotion? Sex?"

I stared up in disgust. "Seriously?" I stood very slowly and moved toward her door, though my instincts told me leaving without making a deal was an extremely dangerous idea. The kind of person Lying Bitch truly was seemed to run on amoral manipulation and exchanges. She was rather attractive, but something about *that* option felt objectively wrong. A promotion would have been nice, but that would have just put me deeper under her thumb. "Money."

She lifted slightly, relieved in her own special way that I was playing ball. "How much?"

What number seemed reasonable? "Ten thousand dollars."

She didn't flinch. Had my number been perfect, or should I have asked for more? Reaching down, she picked up the phone, and I watched as she faked perfect distress for her husband about a sudden financial need. I could hear his confused hurt and despair on the other side of the phone, but he did agree, and she hung up with a smile. "You'll have your money tomorrow. I expect you'll keep your mouth shut."

"I will," I said quietly, my decision made.

It was my turn to go to the bar. Inviting out a few colleagues from work, we sat, drank, and commiserated over the endless hours working with little reward under Lying Bitch. None outright revealed what she was doing to each of them; I marveled at how well our culture had trained us to be polite and loyal to the point of self-enslavement. These were decent men; good men. They deserved to be free and treated with respect.

Fancying myself their secret liberatorfor, in many ways, I wasI soared high on the power of life and death. I was hilarious, compassionate, and the center of attention. I was no longer beat down, frustrated, and stressed, and they could sense it. Determined to make my positivity infectious, I grew ever more boisterous and over-the-top, and we ended the night by invading a karaoke bar and having the best office outing of all time.

We slunk back into work the next morning exhausted and haggard, for not one of us had gone home. We'd greeted the sunrise at a diner, ate waffles and pancakes, and headed into the office as a caravan of still-drunk fools intent on facing the music together.

But the music never came, and neither did Lying Bitch.

Around noonafter we'd had ample time to up coffee and down painkillersthe regional VP arrived with a grief counselor in tow. It seemed that Lying Bitch had accidentally driven herself over the corner of a nearby bridge on the way home; the VP did not mention that she had been drinking at a bar. It was a tragic accident, the company would make sure to take care of her family, and, most importantly, we all had the day off.

I drifted home and lay on the couch as the hours blurred together. Part of me was triumphant and grinning unseen, but part of me was horrified that I'd been right: the planned beating had instead ended in death a second time. I wasn't going to meet with Tom and Jake for another three weeks, but I knew I would be demanding the full story of what happened from them. How did roughing someone up turn into driving them off a bridge?

At the time, I still felt guilt. That gnawing chill compelled me to return to her husband's house, and I stood at the door and offered my condolences. He gravely accepted them, but he also seemed relieved and rested. Behind him, I saw a nanny taking care of the kids, and I understood: either the company benefits or a second life insurance payout had rescued this family from the hole their embezzling new mother figure had dug underneath them.

Free of guilt, I took my leave. Death had not been a tragedy for anyone in that woman's life. Violence had spiked in out of the wilds of human experience with surgical aim and removed a tumor that had grown on the suffocating structure of rules and customs we'd collectively built in a vain attempt to keep out the dangers of nature. Rather than protection, we had built only a framework for imprisonment and parasites.

There was something bigger in what Tom, Jake, and I were doing. I had to think on it.

The weeks rolled by as I dealt with the intense stress and let it flow out of me.

I was given her old job. After that grand night out, the guys universally threw their support behind me to replace her, and the regional VP couldn't give a shit either way. I was inand I found it strange that twice death had been rewarded with immediately increased status. This structure we lived in was cold and impersonal to the extreme.

Without the need for the staff to secretly and constantly overwork, our office productivity and morale rose significantly. *Actually doing my job* made it easier for my men to do theirswhat a concept! By the time my meeting with Tom and Jake approached, I had nothing but contempt for the memory of Lying Bitch.

But I still wanted to know what happened.

Beers in hand, we sat at the back of a new hole-in-the-wall bar and Tom explained. "Well, we caught her outside and alone as planned, but she managed to rip off both our ski masks. Once she saw our faces, we knew we were in trouble, and she was a vicious biter. One thing led to another, and she got knocked out pretty hard. Jake said we had to get rid of her since she'd seen our faces, and we came up with the plan to drive her off the bridge. We didn't want to do itit just got out of hand."

It made sense, at least in our already-twisted perspectives. Jake simply nodded along to this explanation, his expression neutral. I watched his face as Tom spoke, but not a single reaction was evident. At that point, I was beginning to suspect something darkerbut I was still enamored of our new strength.

It was also our turn to assault Jake's boss. The quiet and calm threat in our companion's eyes brooked no argument. It was up to Tom and I to make it happen, and I honestly thought I would have the chance to make this third attack *not* end in murder.

I also honestly thought it would be the last.

	<TITLE> How we became serial killers </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-19 00:02:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This will be my ongoing confession.

Do I feel guilty? In a way, yes. Do I feel guilty the way you might feel guilty if you had killed someone? Not yet, but that may still come.

Theres that, and theres the cynical notion that everyone gets caught eventually. We might be long dead of old age or revenge by the time it happens, but *somebody* will figure it out. I want there to be a record somewhere of what transpiredsomething written as its happeningso that youll know its not a story spun later to save our collective asses from the electric chair. I want you innocents to understand, in real time, how a man becomes a serial killer.

It is so much harder and so much easier than you will ever comprehend.

The cops have one thing right: it begins with a motive. Unless youre a nutjob, one person does not kill another person without a reason. Hell, I cant even get to the gym without proper motivation, so the thought of someone murdering nonsensically just seems insane. Of course, I *do* go to the gym, because I *do* have proper motivation, and we *have* murdered on that same principle.

In fact, it started with a question of principle. There were three of us still nursing beers after everyone else had gone home; we sat in the rear of the bar commiserating over the shit jobs we would have to go back to the next morning. This confession is for me, not for our joke of a justice system, so Ill call my tablemates that night Jake and Tom. I didnt know them well, but that was part of how all this began.

Staring down at his beer, Jake asked, You hear about that kid who got off jail from killing people because he had *affluenza?*

Tom nodded along with his words. Assholes are above the law.

I was fairly drunk and extremely in agreement, so I said, Shit like that is how mob justice starts.

Wish I could get some mob justice where *I* work, Jake muttered. My boss straight up steals from us. Messes with the system to change our hours worked. Caught him with his hand in my jacket pocket in the back room once. But theres not shit I can do about it. If I call the cops, hell just tell them *Im* a thief, and *Ill* go to prison. Game over, man.

Hunched low from drunkenness, Tom stared up from over his beer. Somebody should beat that guys ass. Send him a message. Weasels like that wise up real quick.

Would be nice, I added.

Jakes gaze went dangerously distant. In a low and hate-filled voice, he said, So lets do it.

What?

Come on, were not serious.

I am. Well do it like that movie. You guys beat up my boss, and Ill do yours.

Silence fell over the table as Tom and I stared at him. He may have been beer-talking, but he looked deadly serious. After a moment, I said, Wait, no. You think they wont figure that out? Three random managers get beaten up, and their employees are connected?

I dont know you, Jake shot back, his eyes hard. Were not Facebook friends, and I dont fucking *tweet*. Ive run into you twice at random parties hosted by other people. We have no connectionat least not any theyll see.

Did you pay with a credit card at this bar? I asked, while Tom stared in fear at both of us.

Not yet. Ill pay cash. You both pay cash. And lets do this.

He didnt sound overly drunk, or even mildly crazy. The more we worked through the details, the more the prospect of having my boss getting what was coming to him actually began to sound appealing. More than that, I would get a chance to assault someone elses asshole boss; take out a little frustration, send a message.

But we couldnt actually get away with this, could we?

Research, Tom interrupted meekly.

We both looked at him and waited.

He sat a little taller in his chair and spoke quietly. We watch every episode of CSI. We Google it

On computers at the library, I interjected. And no checking out books. No record.

Right. Tom leaned closer to us. We dont make any decisions until we know everything there is to know about pulling off a crime like this. It has to be air-tight.

Jake nodded along with this, and a slow grin spread across his face. I knew there was a reason I liked you two. Shake on it. Research. His voice went low. And well meet at the bar down the street in three weeks. Friday, eight PM. Itll be crowded, and nobody will recognize or remember us.

Flannigans? Tom asked.

No, the other direction.

The sports pub?

Yeah, that one.

My pulse raced to a roar in my ears. Was this actually going to happen? Maybe not, but it was at least nice to fantasize. Friday, eight PM, three weeks from now.

Shake on it, Jake said again.

And we did.

You see, thats the first step toward serial murder: co-conspirators. They cant just be anybody. You have to understand their ideologies; you have to know *why* theyll actually do this with you, even if you dont truly know the men themselves. No one can ever really know another human being, really, but ideologies run strong, deep, and furious. No man has ever killed another without an ideology involved.

We reminded each other to be smart, and we parted ways.

I went home and almost loaded up CSI on my Netflix. I stopped myself just short. How suspicious would it be if I binge-watched all these just before my boss got beaten up with no trace forensic evidence left behind? And besides, Netflix only had the shitty spinoffs.

I could watch it at the librarybut no, that would mean a hundred hours sitting there. I would be remembered, and they might keep a log of traffic. How could one watch a show without leaving a record?

Of course! DVDs! I went to every run-down video and DVD store in the city and paid cash for every crime-related show I could find. Then, each night after work, I got down to it. While the shows played, I wrote notes, and trips to different libraries later filled me in on what was real and what was bullshit. Turns out, most of those shows are a crockbut they gave me the right keywords, and my research began in earnest.

Most of all, I found a Reddit thread where someonefor the sake of argumentdetailed everything needed to get away with murder in a tremendously long post that had received multiple golds. We only intended a beating, but the advice still applied. I learned quite a bit from that spiel.

It turned out that the solve rate for most crimes was still abysmal, and that police were more concerned with robbing the citizenry these days than catching gangbangers. Our intended targets werent poor, so there *would* be an investigation, but it would be easy enough to make the case a difficult one; difficult cases were often quickly abandoned. We just had to make sure to leave no DNA, no good description, and painful but not highly visible wounds. That last rule was part of the media theory of crime: without a good picture that evokes the emotions, theres no story to tell. Without a story, the media doesnt pick up on it, and nobody gives a shit. The crime fades away as if it never happened.

The big Friday approached the same as any other day, but my stress was off the charts. It was all I could do to maintain the outward appearance of normalityI walked into that bar half an hour early expecting to see cops setting up for a sting operation, but there were only a few scattered families eating wings and burgers at various tables. My two co-conspirators sat in the far back section. They, too, had arrived early.

At first, we hunched over and whispered to each other about all that we had learned over the past few weeks, but we quickly realized that our secretive behavior just made us look suspicious. Relaxing, we took on the nonchalant manner of the families around us. It was then that Jake said, "We do Tom's boss first."

I frowned. "How did you decide that?"

"Think about it," our most determined member explained, looking over at Tom as he spoke. "I'm the angriest of us, clearly. We leave my boss for last, because I'll make sure it happens. Agreed?"

We nodded.

"Good. Then on that same logic in reverse, Tom is the meekest of us three."

Tom shrugged sheepishly. "I'm still in, though."

"I know you are, buddy. That still means we flip the logic aroundyour boss is first. Us two will handle it. Best you don't know the details, except the time you'll need an alibi. We'll let you know."

I nodded, but gulped. Jake and I were really going to do this. We paid cash and went our separate ways after exchanging burner phone numbers.

Jake had bought an old junker car with cash, and we now used it to drive around Tom's business at intervals to check things out. He'd told us the man's schedule as it related to work, and we began compiling his other habits. While Jake's intensity subtly put me off, Tom's well-dressed boss wore a perpetual scowl of contempt that primally engaged me in our plan to teach him a lesson. As we watched through the windows of the building, the man simply oozed prickishness. At times, we actually saw him screaming red-faced at Tom, who just lowered his head and took the abuse.

We chose a night two days before a holiday partythe party would have been an ideal time to catch Well-dressed Prick alone and likely drunk at abnormally late hours, and avoiding that opportunity was exactly how we would divert suspicion away from Tom. If it had been one of the employees, the police would reason, surely they would have chosen the more opportune night.

I still didn't really believe we were actually going to do it. It was fun owning our own capability for violence in a way society usually forced us to suppress; it was fulfilling, in some strange animal way, to realize and entertain the fact that we actually had the power to change things directly. All the money and laws in the world couldn't stop a few determined men from exacting justice, and that thought was immensely and strangely freeing. Of course, we weren't *really* going to do this. The legal system would take everything from us while defending the behavior of Well-dressed Prick with a fury.

But that last night outside Tom's office building, Jake donned his mask and slipped out of the car when the moment came. I *freaked.* I did slip my mask on, too, but I ran after him to stop him. This was an insane idea, and I should have known Jake was angry enough to actually take that deranged step off society's allowed paths.

I remember grey hair. That close, the older man had streaks of grey hair I hadn't noticed before. Thing is, he turned and saw two masked men running at him full speed in the night, and he *didn't get scared.* He just sneered and began to say something condescending. Thinking back on it now, I can see how it might have been a showfalse confidence, or his form of braverybut my inner disgust flared, and I slowed.

Jake pushed him hard with gloved hands, and Well-dressed Prick fell backwards, hit his head on the cement sidewalk, and lay twitching. 

I asked the horrified obvious. "He can't be dead, can he? Just like that?"

"He is," Jake breathed. "Shit."

"What do we do?" I asked, fighting down panic. We were out of the sight of the two cameras that watched the other side of the building, but we were still exposed to the dark side street should anyone drive by. The plan had been to hit him a few times, steal his wallet to make it look like a mugging, and then run.

Snapping out of shock and back into determination, Jake shook his head. "Nothing." He pointed down. "He fell and hit his head. There's literally no evidence on him that we even exist."

"What if he's not dead? What if he wakes up?"

A horrible smell wafted up from him as we stood staring down. Jake moved back. "Smell that? He's *dead.*"

He was right. I'd seen it on numerous episodes: the man's bowels had evacuated at the moment of his death. There was nothing to do but get in the car and go.

For a time, I lived in agonizing fear that the cops would bust down my door, arrest me, and parade me in front of the entire neighborhoodbut Tom reported back to us a week later at a new bar. The death of his boss had been considered a tragic accident, and he himself had been promoted. It had all worked out immensely better than we could have ever hoped.

I was ready to be done, honestly. We'd *killed a man.* No message had been sent. That smug asshole had never known a moment of fear or regret for his actions. We'd just completely eliminated him. Too, I wondered if he had a family. The basic stress inside me could not be mitigated; I'd never witnessed death firsthand, let alone helped cause it. I could only console myself by believing that any man who treated his employees like he had was probably also abusive toward his family, but there was no real way of knowing that.

We'd screwed up and gone way too far; I was going to tell them I was done. It was Jake, though, that grew darker and more determined. "We're all locked into this now," he said quietly and fiercely, his knuckles white around his beer glass. He looked directly at me. "Your boss is next."

I should have known then what was coming. Having lived my entire life before that point in a sea of politeness and protection, I simply couldn't recognize the face of a true sociopatheven when he was sitting right in front of me.

	<TEXT>  I guess that's what he meant by "ranking" instead of "rating" in that he wasn't so much looking for our personal opinion on each stories' content, but maybe how important we felt it was to the series as a whole. Which would, really, make the most recent the most important one.

Absolutely. I think these stories 'broke out' to a larger audience with the Portal in the Forest, which retroactively made The Back Paths, The Fountain of Youth, and The House Beyond the Edge into prequels that some chunk of people simply missed (or read already knowing some future twists). In a ranking system, something has to be ranked at the end, so I vaguely expected something like those results. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, that vein makes me think: I wonder how much of it has to do with materialism, capitalism, and the safety of civilization. When there's nothing to loot, when money is useless, and when there's a nightmare over every next hill, the idea of bandits or robbers just does not make sense. This series has been very fun to delve into because it adds another layer - when the risk of death is removed, too, where does interhuman evil spring from? All of our motivations for harming our fellow man have been removed. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [This survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V2SP7FZ) will remain open for the time being, but the results are pretty solid.

So far, 97 respondents have taken the survey since I posted it last week. That's a fantastic response rate, and I want to thank you all for participating.

Now remember, these results didn't ask respondents to *rate* each series, but rather, *rank* them, so nobody is saying a given series is good or bad; they're reporting in which ones they personally identified with the most. This likely has several factors, like which series readers happened upon first, which one touched on issues they relate to, and so on.

The order that has emerged in the data is:

* #1: The Desolate Guardians

* #2: The Portal in the Forest

* #3: The Crushing Fist

* #4: The New Exodus Vanguard

* #5: Our Final Acts

* #6: Humanity Revived

* #7: The Empty Earth

* #8: The Fountain of Youth

* #9: The Moon Aflame

* #10: The Back Paths

* #11: The House Beyond the Edge

This is somewhat in line with what I expected based on anecdotal feedback, but there are also some surprising upsets!

Question Two was also very important. Asked "Would you be interested in more surveys like this one to help guide where these stories go?", a whopping 91 out of 97 people said yes.

I'm very excited about getting more involved with the readers. This Wednesday, I'll include with my regular postings a deeper survey that will hopefully give you a chance to tell me what you like  and don't like. Don't be shy or hold back, I can take any criticism! </TEXT>

It didn't simply fling him; it tried to carefully drop him off. Impacting his already weak left arm hard enough to snap it, he landed near the top of something his half-conscious mind perceived as a white skyscraper. Sliding down along the sheer glass windows as the building angled back and forth, he bumped repeatedly against rough outcroppingsand finally snapped back to full awareness once he realized he was actually sliding down a tremendously long tooth. The beast's mouth was open to the sky as it dumped hundreds into the depths; the tooth was therefore nearly flat at the moment, but moving incidentally with great force. More horizontal white skyscrapers framed his slide to the left and right, but the opposite teeth were lost in grey haze.

Hands grabbed his broken arm, and he screamed in agony.

The pain faded only once he was inside the gooey and stench-filled cavity where a dozen others clung to whatever handholds they could manage. At the opening, those that had grabbed him beckoned for unseen runners to leap to that tooth or find cavities of their own in which to hide.

Fearful faces watched him as they contemplated their hopeless situation; he only recognized one. "Doctor Wygant?"

"Call me Mona," she said with a dark-humored, exhausted, and hopeless laugh. "Given what's about to happen, I feel like all of us here can be on a first name basis."

An older couple gripped each other close against rotted bone and the wife asked, "Is there nothing we can do?"

Mona shook her head, and her cracked glasses dropped a shard into black cavity-goo. "Even if we manage to stay in here, when this thing begins moving again, the G-forces will be utterly tremendous. Its apex is above the clouds, and it rolls to get around. It'll be" She paused as the forces of the beast's moving mouth sent them all straining one way, and then the other. "worse than the most horrible rollercoaster you've ever been on. The forces alone will knock us unconscious and then kill us, if they don't just directly fling us out."

Still trying to put together some final logical plan, Neil suggested, "Should we try to set ourselves up to get flung off to the ground and clear?"

"Maybe," Mona countered, swinging around her pillar of bone as they were all slammed with the force of a single chewing motion. She forced out her words. "But I imagine its food often does this. It'll probably just pick us off" In a brief interlude between pressures, she seemed to have made her analysis. "Edgar, I don't want you trying to save me."

"What are you doing?" Neil asked, while the others looked on in surprise. "Can he hear you? Are you on the radio?"

"No," she answered, continuing. "Edgar, you already know everything I want to tell you. I just need you to leave this be. You can't win. You can't save us."

"*Is he here?*" Neil asked again, looking around in hopeful confusion.

"No," she answered again. "But he will be."

It was then that Neil understood why she was speaking, and in what manner his friend would be reading her words. They were, themselves, now already in the doomed logs Edgar had often spoken of. "If this doesn't work, please find and help Kumari!" he screamed, realizing that the situation was truly without standard escape. He sent one of his hands down to his pocket to reach for the second gemstone. Struggling to breathe against the pure force compression of his chest, he hooked his broken arm into a hole in the tooth enamel and tried not to pass out as he grasped for the device. The assault of pressure seemed to come from inside him, and there was no way to resist it.

Mona squeezed her eyes shut and let tears flow down her strained cheeks. "I just hope it stays dead so the baby doesn't go through what we're about to"

His entire body squeezed, his face pressured, his vision blurry, Neil fought the acceleration to look up at her. "You're?"

"Yeah."

"God" he breathed. "damnit."

There was no longer any fear, and the force lifted for a moment as immense vibrations hinted that the beast was swallowing part of its meal. He'd made this decision already once beforeto try to set an example for his daughter, to try to be a good person, to try to do something that *mattered.* He could hide among the rocks as the tentacles came, for there was nothing he could have done, but he couldn't escape and let this woman'sand no doubt, Edgar'sbaby suffer more horribly than could even be imagined. By protecting and helping him and Kumari, Edgar had more than earned this in return. This was what being a manno, a worthwhile human beingmeant.

He didn't have the energy to say anything. He just slipped out of his spot, pulled the rainbow-latticed amethyst from his pocket, and thrust it into Mona's hand. She looked up in shock, but he curled her fingers around it and forced her to click the slight indentation within before she could react.

She vanished in a flash of amethyst lighthopefully off to wherever the other gemstone had fallen in the distance.

There was no time to get back to his spot, but it didn't matter now. The acceleration force returned, and he slid out along black goo and into the open air. Was he falling? It was hazy and the smell was horrendous, but it seemed as if the clouds and blasting wind were shooting up while he remained stationary. Slick cave-like flesh slid past as he fell through the thing's massive throat; open air followed again as he sailed down into a vast green-fogged chamber lit by its own dim phosphorescence. Even as he fell, he found himself awed by the sheer size and scope. This was a world all its own, here inside a beast half the size of a country, and he took in what majesty he could.

---

Edgar looked up from the book with haunted eyes. Whatever the Waystation had looked like, it was gone now. A sheer and clean ridge had been swept free of all construction and evidence of settlement. Slamming the tome closed, he motioned the dozen men behind him toward the stub of a cliff, where he suspected caves held survivors. Hanging back himself, he surveyed the distant crushed forestswhere a single lonely figure was working her way over the devastation.

	<TEXT> Neil crouched low and examined the fittings. "We stripped one of the screws. Let's drill this one a tiny bit wider and try again."

One of the drillers headed over with his equipment, pulled out his ear plugs, and asked, "What?"

Neil repeated himself, and then left the man to his job. Wiping the sweat from his forehead, he surveyed the distant valleys from his high vantage point at the top of the cliffs above the Waystation. The churned-up forested clay bowl in which he had once spent a night trapped now apparently spanned only the length of a single mighty leap; beyond, he could see the spot where he and Showman had stopped the truck. Doctor Wygant had taken it back to Concord weeks ago and returned on foot without it, but it was as if he could still feel his past self standing atop that rocky slope and studying the path ahead with wonder and trepidation. Now he knew the community intimately, and had a semblance of a home again. His past self stood looking back at him, but that man had only thought of this place as a finish line to reach his lost wife.

This was a strange Earth. It was at rather random times hot like a desert, humid like a jungle, and cold in that way that could normally only be felt on an autumn beach as chill sea breezes needled in. What season was it here? There was no way to know, really. He had only been faced with the weather more often when this project had forced him to be outside daily.

The system in question had been patched together with the hard work of dozens of clever builders, forgers, and metalworkers. It was rough around the edges, but he still regarded it with pride. He and the three other engineers had been given piles of junk and somehow turned them into mechanical gold. Made from random materials carried across the worlds by charitable families, the collection basins and crafted sluice system would serve as the Waystations first real form of active defense.
 
Come on Neil, Ellwood shouted, waving him toward the lower rock slope and the stairs that had been carefully carved into the cliff. Its dinner time. I'm having the team over.

He clung to the cool cliff wall and followed her down the steep recently-carved staircase. Ahead of him, she bounded step to step with her usual peppy energy. He guessed that they were really about the same age, but she made him feel like an old man sometimes.
 
Once back on blessed level ground, he caught the greeting of the other two engineers and headed over. Besides redheaded and energetic Ellwoodwho was in chargethere was also Susan, an engineer from the South Korea of the Earth numbered one higher than his, and Dave, a perpetually red-faced man who had somehow managed to remain obese and cheerful despite the strains of the exodus. Together, the four walked and talked; it was only here that Neil could finally speak with others on the same level about so many engineering and logistical issues that had built up in the back of his mind. They were all still in the initial phase of getting to know each other, but he was warming up to the idea of having friends that werent around purely out of circumstance or necessity. He even let himself smile at them sometimes without simultaneously secretly despairing about Rani. He was allowed to be happy, he often reminded himself. Being happy was not somehow a betrayal; she was lost, but he had done and would do everything in his power to find her.
 
On that front, too, he was hoping for progress. Around the crude table in Ellwoods little hut, he placed crusts of multi-colored fungus and bits of greening meat on an imaginary map of the region. So we place towers by each rift. The colored chalk marking system we have is decent, but these can contain information about whats next for anyone traveling, *and* they can pass along radio signals. Its ambitious, given our manpower and resources, but its time we stopped wandering in the dark. It's time we started talking again. Acting, rather than reacting. With the right system, we could communicate with Concord and the Zkirax in real time.
 
Susan nodded enthusiastically. I could talk to my husband. Hes in those tunnels with our sons.
 
Neil froze with a smile still plastered on his face. She hadnt mentioned a family in the last couple weeks; perhaps shed been trying not to think about the distance, or perhaps they were closer as a group now. He realized that even though he couldnt tell her what was going to happen when the insects ran out of food, he *could* request her husband and sons come to the Waystation if the radio network was finished in time.
 
Dave popped one of the bits of fungus into his mouth. While chewing, he said, Good communication is an incredible tool. Were working blind here. It would help to be able to coordinate designs and plans with engineers elsewhere. We might even get a generalized electrical grid up and running in a few years.
 
Randyfor Neil now thought of her as more of a friend and colleague than a bossshook her head, sending her red ponytail bouncing. Lets not get ahead of ourselves. Setting up a radio network is going to be dangerous work, and then itll need to be defended. This should be our next project, but its not going to be easy.
 
Over on the bed in the corner, Pixley took a swig from a half-empty bottle of liquor and grunted. Interrupting their conversation for the first time that night, she muttered, Well do it because we have to. We might not be under direct attack, but this is still a war. She did not look at them; her dark gaze remained fixed on the wall.
 
Randy looked about to speak, but then she visibly thought better of it.
 
Neil stepped aside to let the group of four around the table see her more directly. So weve got a go ahead?
 
Yeah. She lifted the bottle for another sip. For what good itll do.
 
Now unleashing a glare, Randy sighed. Dont mind her. Weve been through some pretty terrible stuff; seen some things that are way bigger than us. Were all doing what we have to do because theres nobody better than us left to do the jobs; well persevere because we have to, and everything will turn out alright. She knows that. Shell be more level-headed tomorrow*when shes sober.*
 
The blonde made an irritated noise and sank lower in the bed.
 
In their introverted reaction to the spat, the other three engineers were united. Neil coughed and moved back into place at the table to block Pixley from view. Susan looked to Dave, and Davewho was more red-faced than normaltook a deep breath. Well then, he said, breaking the tension. Lets start estimating the manpower we need. He began ripping up the old meat into tiny strips and placing them near the bits of fungus that represent rips between realities. And how were going to macgyver clay and bark into complex electronics.
 
They built a plan and alternately agreed and argued well into the night; Neil took his leave and split from the others after a few minutes conversation outside Ellwoods hut. Sighing as he walked through the cool darkness between rock wall and cliff, he tried to calm down and gain some perspective on his life. Every single day things changed; every single day, new people, new threats, and new information rolled in through the valleys and along the ridges of this primordial world. Through gaps between the rock above where the hinged native-wood hatches lay open, he saw flashes of the night skyand the approaching white wall in space that would one day bring this particular Earth to an end.
 
It was all temporary; every single bit of it. The farm realities had been temporary. The Zkirax tunnels had been temporary. Concord had been temporary, and now this Waystation nestled in crevices and canyonshad the weeks he had already spent here been borrowed time? He almost couldnt bring himself to accept that he and his daughter were finally safe, for in that acceptance there seemed to be vulnerability. He ducked into his shed and lay with exhaustion on his cot.
 
Where have you been? Rani whispered.
 
And then there was this. He knew their strange situation couldnt last. He could already feel negativity lurking in the corners of every conversation. Working.
 
In the middle of the night?
 
Yeah, he replied, doing his best to keep calm and collected despite the irritation prodding his inner emotions. I was with the other engineers planning a new system.
 
Thats good. They really like you.
 
I really like them, he said, genuinely letting himself feel it now that it seemed the conversation had actually gone positive for once. Theyre good people.
 
She didnt say anything for a few seconds, and then whispered, You know, you can tell me if youre seeing other people.
 
God damnitthe irritation in his chest became a stronger fire, but still he kept his words restrained. Im not seeing anyone.
 
Were not married, she continued. Hell, we dont even really know each other. It would be fine if so.
 
Im *not seeing anyone.* Im *married.*
 
In the dark, she shifted. Im just trying to be cool with a crazy situation, you know?
 
His annoyance faded, and he just felt sad. Yeah, I know, Im sorry.
 
Im just not sure what the morals are anymore, she told him, moving an inch closer. Theyre so insistent about people pairing up and having babiesand I know it hurts, but your wifes not here. 
 
He moved an inch back even though the gap between their beds would have kept them separated regardless. Im not entirely convinced we need to be having more babies, not when people cant die. Overpopulations going to hit us hard.
 
But we dont know anything about why people cant die, she countered with a rational tone. You know they estimate forty percent of us out here are walking around dead?
 
Yeah.
 
What happens if it ends tomorrow? What happens if they just fall down dead for real and thats it?
 
In the quiet void of the night, his audible swallow was loud and awkward. I hadnt thought about that.
 
Im just saying, your wife will understand. Its one of your duties. If Im not that woman, let me know, and I can switch to another shed like Showman did.
 
He couldnt see her, but he knew she was curled up with the careful bundle that contained Kumari. He turned over and lay awake in the dark staring at the slatted wall; his eyes were open, but he saw only the vast distance of his own mind and future fears. In those solitary hours, he could relate very strongly to their blonde commander sitting drunk in Ellwoods hut. It was as if life was constantly finding new and very personal ways to attack each of them. He said nothing furtherand neither did Rani.
 
Waking far earlier than he would have liked, he stumbled out of the shed and into chaos. Standard reaction protocol involved no shouting or loud noises, so the streams of men running in both directions were eerily hushed. After leaning back into the shed and telling his stunned bunkmate to protect Kumari, he dashed out to run alongside one that he knew. Yao, whats going on?
 
The other man skipped his usual taciturn reaction and answered without slowing. Scouts on the ridge saw some serious shit coming our way. Above, one of the latch-men slipped from his carved ledge and nearly fell; another latch-man grabbed him at the last moment, swung him up, and then closed both nearby hinged hatches with determined haste. Neil stared up, but Yao pushed him along and said, Youve had training. We need every man on the walls. Where's your friend Showman?
 
"At Concord on a run." Neil fell in line immediately, but his pulse began pounding in his head as he ran with the others toward threats unknown and likely horrifying. His role as an engineer had relegated him to positions away from many prior dangers, but he saw Dave huffing along up aheadthe situation had to be extremely serious if literally *all* the men were needed. Too, by Pixleys order, no women were allowed to endanger themselves. Many of the female residents of the Waystation were pregnant, and nobody was sure what would happen to their babies if they died and resurrected.
 
Neil followed his training from those early drills as ear plugs and weapons were handed out. They wouldnt be able to hear shouted commands, but the whole point was to be quiet, and most orders would be given with hand signals. Rushing up the walls of piled rocks and boulders alongside numerous men, he found a vantage point just under native-wood slats.
 
Complete silence fell.
 
The attention of so many was a nearly palpable force sweeping through the grey morning air. Neil stared out, too, watching the chill pre-dawn valley and the shadowed ridge with heart-pounding anticipation. Hed never been a fan of guns, but the shotgun hed been given was now a source of reassurance and strength. Just what did these battle-hardened soldiers consider *serious shit?*
 
A slight vibration tickled his bent legs with barely perceptible static. He looked aroundothers had also felt it. Beside him, Dave huffed up and crouched against the rocks. Yao waved everyone to silence and pointed back out toward the valley. It was still early morning, and any refugees that had camped for the night would likely not be on the road. That was the only consolation.

A vertical glimmering sliver appeared first. Within the space of several heartbeats, the sliver crested the ridge, shot down the slope with force, and churned its way across the valley. Realizing that it was devices like this one that had created the strange path he himself had run along, Neil gaped in shock as the giant sawblade roared past at speed. The tiger eye gemstone in the central gap of the rotating saw paid them no heed. In as many heartbeats, it was over their ridge and down into the next valley, where the massive ruptured rift to the next base branch accepted it with a silent shimmer.
 
A wave of scattered slithery shadows followed. Neil narrowed his eyes as he recognized something exotic for oncehed seen one of them on his own world while trying to drive toward escape. An entire tribe of living pools of blood slid across the base of the valley, up the slope, and past their piled walls. Some of the pools merged into a larger blob and twitched their way, but one man covered a cut hed suffered from the rocks; the earth trembled again, and the viscous red liquids moved on with a scattered group jumpiness that could only be described as animal terror.
 
Multiple different strange creatures followed as the sun rose higher in the sky, and he began to instinctively understand: these living things were fleeing en masse as deer and birds might have from a forest fire. A massive four-tusked boar charged past, followed by a gaunt family of spectral humanoids with blue and purple eyes in strange colors that defied comparison; to these, he leapt up an inch and pressed his forehead against native-wood. It was the same family he had once shared a rain-drowned canyon with, and they were no threat as far as he knew, but there was nothing he could do to explain that to Yao or convince the others to let them in. Hoping they would catch that pursued four-tusked boar, he watched them go with the despair that only one parent could feel for another.
 
But the others did open the heavy swiveling gates for the next beings to pass. Starving, dirty, and weak to the point of collapse, eighteen yellow-skinned men, women, and children wearing strange robe-like clothing staggered in and fell to the ground. We ran, one murmuredand women emerged from deeper in hiding in the Waystation to take these very different refugees to huts where they could be taken care of and allowed to rest.
 
Neil looked to Yao and then to Dave, but neither spoke. It was too important to remain quiet. The earth trembled more heavily this time, and a dozen men climbed down and pushed against the main gates to close them while there was still space for the hinges to scream and whine without risk. Seconds after the horrible squealing finally stopped, flocks of large *somethings* flew overhead, but his vantage between rock and native-wood made it impossible to tell what was passing.
 
As tense as the situation was, clutching the rocks for so long began to take its toll. Neil shifted uncomfortably and then froze as a glowing woman in pale white passed through the flat rocky space between their wall and the opposite sheer slope of the pass; she turned, and it was Rani. Many of the menhimself includedstarted to rise, but those behind them gripped their shoulders and held them down. Daves hand on his back kept him in place, and Neil put a hand over his own mouth to keep from calling out. There was no way this was real.
 
**You people again? Youre everywhere!** The false Rani shouted in irritation without actually speaking. However she was communicating, it could be heard through their ear plugs. **Get out of here! Are you insane?**

Something slithered on, and the illusion went with it. Stunned, Neil stared after it in turmoil. Around him, many others were doing the same. Had it appeared as each of their lost loved ones? He dug a thumbnail into his arm to force himself to focus; a surreal weight on his senses slowly lifted.
 
A menagerie of other strange lifeforms surged through the shattered forest; the first third of the valley darkened as a mass of shadow roiled up over the ridge. It was nearly noonand the impetus behind the desperate stampede had finally appeared. A chill beyond anything he had ever felt slunk around his heart. This was the second danger he recognized, and this one he had also seen on his own world. He suddenly recalled watching a video of this massive tentacled titan as it approached across a Chinese city; this was the sight that had sent him into flight with his family. If they hadnt left that day, if Rani hadnt bribed that cop, if they hadnt found the rift in timethere were countless *ifs* and lucky chances that had brought them this far, and this titan had been the very first. In a way, it had saved his family then, a polar opposite to the mortal danger it posed now. Across the wilds of the multiverse, it had fled the cold along the same path, and it had finally caught up to him.
 
Three weeks in one place.
 
Completely and utterly paralyzed, he realized: it had always been coming.
 
Three weeks in one place.
 
It had always been behind him. This was the only route to safety. Her Glory on the left, Grey Riders on the right, lethal cold behindall the threats of the region had fled through this chokepoint. It had only ever been a matter of time.
 
The beast reached a high point above the ridge and then crashed down into the valley, crushing what primordial trees had survived the other threats. The ground trembled again, and it was now clear that each shudder had been the result of this creature plunging into each valley as it approached. Out of determined courage or absolute terror, the men to either side of Neil remained dead silent.  He knew: if this beast noticed them, the Waystation would be erased from existence.
 
Clutching the shaking rocks, he watched with wide eyes as the roughly spherical mass of tentacles rolled closerand then over them. The bulk of the beast rested mainly on the bed of the pass itself, but the wood overhead creaked menacingly from the weight of random flailing and squirming tentacles. Both guns and men lowered; one to avoid the bulging wood, and the other because bullets would be useless against a monster that size.
 
One of the foot-thick hatches splintered and exploded downward; in complete silence, terrified men dragged their wounded comrades out of the way, and those who could move of their own accord scattered. A single scream would
 
a dark purple tentacle found a wounded man and immediately curled around his midsection. In an instant, the motion above changed and darkness descended. Lithe otherworldly limbs snaked down and began flailing about in search of more food as their owner let blast a bellow of hunger. Against the beast itself, nothing could be done, but guns were immediately lifted and employed against the unholy mass of searching flesh.
 
Thankful for the plugs protecting his ears from all the weapon noise, Neil crouched back between two large rocks with Dave and held his shotgun up in case any of the searching limbs came close. Flashes of light made it impossible to see, while gunsmoke made it impossible to breathe. Every ruptured limb was immediately replaced from the writhing mass above.
 
Dave grabbed his arm and pointed up past the nightmare. There was only one shot: the system they had built among the cliffs was perfectly positioned for use, but they hadnt yet set up the proper shifts and personnel roles to employ the defenses. Susan had joked that afternoon, What are the chances well need it this very night?
 
Neil grimaced. A hundred percent, Susan. A hundred goddamn percent.
 
Something flickered close. He gripped the shotgun hard and pulled. The spray sent him painfully back against stone, but the tentacles searching end exploded into goo. Dave used the opportunity to run forward and gesture frantically to Yao, who subsequently ordered three men up the steep staircase. Hand signals ordered covering fire, and weapons turned to the air to spit violence and clear the way.
 
The cost was dear. With lighter direct resistance, the scrambling limbs curled around defender after defender and plucked them away into the horrendous unseen stench-pouring maw above. More hatches buckled and exploded; a storm of aberrant flesh poured into their manmade canyon as the supremely angered beast screeched promises of death. Rather than be a hero, Neil pushed deeper between the rocks, even scraping himself rather horribly to buy another half body length. The way he figured it, this wasn't cowardice. Hed already done his part. He had a daughter to live for, and whatever waited above would take him away from her one way or another.
 
But the first climber was knocked away from the steps and fell horribly into a shed. The split effort of the shooters below weakened further, and the second man was pulled up and out of sight. The third made it nearly to the point where the steps dipped into a protective crevasse, but a stray bullet splattered red across his thigh and he tumbled backwards.
 
That was it. There was no time for a second try. The crowd of remaining able-bodied men pressed backwards together against the rocks and sent up a hailstorm of shots, but that would only last as long as their ammo. Some visibly considered turning their weapons on themselves, but the nightmare only intensified when they visibly realized they couldnt even kill themselves. Behind their bleeding legs, Neil jammed his limbs further and further back. Dave tried to follow suit nearby, but he simply couldn't fit. He looked over with haunted eyes.
 
Ahead, the huge burn-scarred man that Neil had seen carrying rocks now stepped forward among the curtain of grasping limbs. Those that tried to curl around him were torn asunder for their efforts; those that got in his way, he ripped in twain. Yao spoke to him with his hands, and the man nodded, stepped toward the cliff, turned on something at his waist, and began climbing with his bare hands as a sphere of white light grew to surround him. His fingers crunched rock as he ascended, and Neil looked on in amazement only as long as it took for the defenders to rally their final shots to clear the way for the mans climb. Could the belt he had brought help a second time? Until they could figure out how it worked, there was only residual naturally regenerating charge left in the thing, but a minute or two would be enough. The beacon of light marked the scarred man's ascent as a sign of rising hope.

Knives were brandished as the ammo ran out; black ichor and red blood sprayed copiously in every direction. One limb slid into Neil's hiding place to batter him in the face, and he hit the rock to his left with a painful thud. Dazed, he struggled to hold off the purple-skinned arm sliding around his midsection. He curled his feet against what corners he could find and resisted the pull. To his right, Dave slid forward as two curled muscles grabbed him by each shoulder.
 
A great roar rang out, and the tentacles reflexively retracted. Light streamed in from the noon sun, nearly blinding in its sudden intensity. Bashing back and forth into the cliffs above, the titan tried to somehow slough off the damage, but it was far too latethe rock basins above had naturally gathered large lakes of native acid rain, and the funnels and pipes that the engineers and laborers had built had sprayed thousands of gallons of it along the beast in mere seconds. The monstrous scream shook both the earth and the men below before fading into a cacophonous cry of painand then, finally, a dying whimper.
 
Not quite believing it had actually worked, Neil climbed up the rocks alongside Dave and fifty other survivors to survey the wide morass of half-melted flesh. He pulled out his ear plugs and breathed, Holy crap.
 
Daves cheeks bounced as he nodded rapidly. Were alive!
 
They are too, someone else commented. Lets get them out of its stomach! They cant die!

Running down the piled walls and then up the curves of the monster's twitching corpse alongside the entire company of defenders, Neil avoided the acid-melted oozing flesh and started cutting with his knife near where the stomach might be. Ahead, a monstrous grinning skull and jaw appeared as the rest of the organic material around the beast's head seeped away; he ignored the omen of death and pulled at the very human limbs that now erupted through the fresh wounds. Each bursting forth into the open air and screaming happily with freedom, man after man was pulled from the beast's stomach and cleaned of the digestive acid that was, thankfully, much weaker than that which had liquefied its owner's face and brain.

"*Head counts,*" Yao ordered. "We're not leaving anyone to rot in there."

A proud shout echoed from the cliffs above, where the scarred man stood gleaming white and glowing at the height of his savior ascent. The sphere flickered off, spent, but those below still watched in awe.

With the first positive emotion Neil had ever seen in the man, Yao called up, "Are you back?"

"I am," came the determined response. "Start cutting up the parts that are away from the acid. We'll eat like kings for months. You've earned it."

A great cheer went up from the gore-, sweat-, and ichor-covered three hundred odd men at their victoryand at the prospect of eating well for once. Neil did not join in; he was exhausted in every sense of the word, yes, but his logical mind remained fixated on logistical concerns as he stared at the abomination's grinning and black-dripping skull. All credit to the men involved, but how had the Chinese army not managed to stop this thing?

"That's Kendrick the Scarred!" Dave said excitedly, clapping his shoulder. "The Captain himself, he's back!"

Still half-absent, Neil turned his head to look at his colleague. "That's him? From the Week of Hell stories?" Now he understood why Yao, Pixley, Doctor Wygant, and Randy had all refused to answer questions about him; what little he knew, Edgar had mentioned in passing. Indeed, that squad had lost much. They had once numbered ten, but there were only five of them here. Had Kendrick the Scarred blamed his own decisions for the losses and been unable to lead? The self-flagellant punishment of building the walls all by himself now made sense. Still, the effort had not been in vain. They'd only survived because

The shaking had already begun some minutes before, but he hadn't noticed it while standing on the massive deflating and squishy corpse. The three hundred odd cheers died on ashen lips as each man slowly turned to behold their own arrogance and hopelessness. The noon sun faded behind a propelled wake of dense clouds as the dark writhing horizon itself approached at speed. The planet-shaking roar brought its own foul hurricane winds, but, lacking yet a given order, the men held up their arms, gripped each other, and managed to remain standing despite their uneven footing.

Where others did not, Neil understood. The dead abomination on which they stoodthe creature which they had shot up, melted with acid, and then defiled with kniveswas not the one he had seen on video destroying an entire country. This creature was far too small for that. This creature was just a baby, and all the horrible things they had done to it had been performed directly in front of its mother.

The noxious hurricane roar faded, restoring the ability to breathe, smell, and hear; a squeal remained in Neil's ears, but it was not too loud to hear Kendrick the Scarred's dismayed and awed order. There had to be a backup plan. There had to be secret weapons. This was the famed Captain, and there had to be *something.*

"The Waystation is over," Kendrick shouted as he stood atop that cliff and gazed up at the gigabeast that had brought its own sky-spanning halo of clouds. "There's nothing we can do. Run and hide."

No. That couldn't be it, could it? The shock attempted to paralyze him, but Neil immediately thought of Kumari and took off running across the baby titan's hilly flesh; three hundred men broke in rapid clusters. Those that had someone inside to care about followed. Those that did not scattered down the pass and toward the massive rift to the next world. These, Neil lost track of as he clambered over the rock walls and into the debris-littered battlefield inside.

Several of the women and one yellow-skinned man in a white robe stood watching in surprise. They'd felt the ground continue to shake, but, from between cliff and wall, they couldn't yet see what was coming. Overhead, a loud crack shot up through natural stone simply from the vibrations, and those below moved to action.

Running up to Randy, Neil asked desperately, "Where's Rani?!"

The redhead didn't waste time. Dragging him further down into the narrow canyon of the Waystation, she led him toward the shelter areas. "What's happening? What is it?"

"It's huge!" he shouted, unable to elaborate for lack of breath. "This is it!"

"It?" She knew what he meant, but she didn't seem to want to believe it.

"Wait," he panted, darting into his shed briefly. Under the cot, he had hidden one pair of the small devices that had been inside the other crate Edgar had given him. They were two curious amethyst gemstones contained in strange rainbow crystalline matrices his friend had described as Yngtakian, whatever that meant. What mattered was that these were an untested fusion of two very different technologies, and thus a last resort. He rolled them around in his hand, thinking quickly; he couldn't close his fist around both, as they were slightly too large. He decided to shove one in each pocket. Leaving the shed, he saw Yao and Doctor Wygant now joining Randy as the forefront of the flood of men surged past. Pushing through the crowd, he joined his boss even as darkness blotted out the sun.

Where the previous attack had come as a storm of small tentacles, this one began with a single purple-mottled limb pushing down to completely knock away an entire section of the rock wall as if it was nothing more than a pile of pebbles.

There was no longer any rational thought. He ran among a sea of screams; terrified faces alternately looked ahead as their owners ran and back up as slender limbs reached down to lift away their neighbors. The crowd thinned one by one as they fled down the last slope toward the caves at the end of the Waystation canyon. Here, others were still stepping out of sheds in confusion only to be plucked away. Of the yellow-skinned refugees, none were targeted, and Neil followed Randy and ducked among them as they ran.

"It's just after us!" Randy screamed.

Beside her, Yao carried a crying yellow-skinned child. "For what we did."

The hurricane roar came again, battering their clothes and shaking the world itself. The cliffs overhead cracked and sent down debris, but the focused blast of air down the canyon flung them all along far faster than they could have ever run. Sailing into the caves proper and cracking his left arm horribly against the wall among a storm of similar impacts, Neil staggered through the rushing gale and mind-numbing noise in search of one single thing. He saw them ahead, where dozens of terrified women and children waited with wide eyes and bodies braced against the wind. He called out her name, but he couldn't even hear himself.

Still, she saw him. With Kumari in her arms, she beckoned, and he finally reached them as the second roar of titanic rage finally faded. An impact shook everything around them, but this was no motion pain of the earth as the beast movedthis was a direct strike. Another followed. Running deeper into the caves with so many others at their heels, he realized that the beast was attacking the cliffs themselves. It would tear the bedrock away above to expose the caves and those horrible little creatures that had killed its child. In a way, he understood that rage. He himself had been consumed by it in that single eternal moment in which he had rushed Grayson and stabbed him with Showman's knife.

As a unified tide, they came to the end of the caves and stopped. More people flooded in behind them, but there was nowhere to gothe tiny stream of water that had carved these tunnels over the ages now exited through a tiny hole into depths unknown. "There!" Yao said, pointing back the way they had come.

A small passage shot back at an angle impossible for the tentacles to curl into. Children ran through, most of the women squeezed by with some pain, and the men took turns trying to fit.

Neil touched Kumari's cheek. His daughter had still been smiling until that moment; she scrunched her face and began crying quietly. Did she have some idea what was about to happen?

"I'll take care of her," Rani promised.

He nodded with acceptance. She was not his Rani, but it didn't matter anymorenot in these moments. He grabbed her and kissed her very hard. "Thank you."

"If this was all it took" she said with a tearful laugh as a tremendous hit audibly ripped off another layer of the ridge overhead.

"Go!" Yao ordered, and she slipped through the crack with Kumari, who began crying louder as she was carried away.

Just like that, he was left bereft and alone with a hundred other men. For them, there was nowhere to go. They stared around and at each other as the battering above continued.

"What if we cut off our limbs and throw each other through the crack?" one man offered. "We'll regenerate eventually, right?"

With a distant gaze, Yao shook his head. "It's not going to stop until it finds us." He looked over at what yellow-skinned men remained; their women and children had already gone deeper. "I think you guys are safe. It wants us."

Neil felt a sliver of relief as his colleague came forward through the crowd, but Dave said what many were thinking. "We have to go out there. We have to make it think it got us all. It didn't see *them*," he explained, referring to those that had been deeper in the Waystation during the attack.

Was this what it meant to be a man? Before the era of rampant civilization and cushy desk jobs, back when tribes of survivors fought nature itself to perpetuate the species, was this what manhood had been about? Neil followed, dazed, as the group began slowly walking back up through the tunnels. By himself, he might not have had the courage, but there was something about the group willpower that made it impossible to chicken out; nay, that made it an honorable and determined thing. If he broke, they would break. If they broke, he would break. Despite pale faces, fearful sweat, and shivering anticipation, the hundred men remained solid.
 
Again, he wondered what would happen if nothing remained for his soul to return to. In the depths of that beast, there was no doubt every tiny piece of him would be destroyed. The two gemstones in his pockets remained as the only shred of hope that there might be some last-minute shot at survival.

They emerged into the pure night of a canyon completely overshadowed by a beast whose proportions were beyond comprehension. To the credit of these menperhaps a victory in itself, Neil thoughtthe titan actually hesitated at the sight of them. Was it wondering at a trick? Perhaps momentarily scared of some sort of attack? Or was it a slight moment of respect for their choice?

"This is gonna suck," Dave breathed, his face beet red from fear.

Neil nodded and spoke with quiet resignation. "Yeah."

*Just leave*, he willed it. *Just go away. Just turn and go. Killing us won't bring back your child. Just go.*

But it didn't. A purplish cloud of roiling flesh surged at them, and the snap nearly winded him. Grasped around the midsection by thick muscle, he pushed hard in resistance as it lifted him up at speed. Around him, the others soared at various speeds, as if they were all part of some horrific carnival ride. Lifted through dense fog and into searing brightness, he saw a forest of tentacles arching above the clouds, each with a person in hand. His heart sank as he realized that not all of the women and children had escaped; those that had been grabbed on the run to the caves were here, too. It had kept them here in the sky until it had everyoneperhaps as a way to make sure it had all those that had harmed its child, or perhaps as a form of emotional vengeance. Fighting for breath and struggling to see despite the blinding sun, he confirmed that it was true: none of the hundreds up here were yellow-skinned.

But what was it waiting for? His terror flared not for himself, but for that beautiful little girl who knew no evil in the world. In all their flight, she had only cried twiceboth times for the coming death of her father. He wanted that innocence to remain. He hoped desperately that she would not end up cynical and depressed like so many others out here. He hoped desperately that she would survive this. *What was it waiting for?*

"It's all of us, you bitch!" he screamed, hitting the thick limb around his midsection. "That's all of us! You have us all!"

It either couldn't hear him, or didn't listen. His brain punctured his fear with the machinations of logic, and he bent his arm painfully around the purple flesh to reach one of the gemstones in his pocket. Lifting it and waiting for a high point in the randomly moving tentacle's motion, he hurled it as hard as he could. It would never have cleared the beast if not for the height and position advantage he had near the edge; as it was, the rainbow-encased amethyst glinted brightly as it sailed off into the unknown distance.

 But it was not time yet. If he tried anything now, the creature would keep looking. It wanted all of them.

The thin air and freezing cold that high threatened to knock him unconscious, but he pushed against the curled weight and breathed in what he could. He could hear distant screams from those hundreds out there in the sky with him, but real communication was impossible. There was nothing to do but wait and suffer, until, at long last, the forest of raised limbs closed together like a sinking flower and dumped them all down into that waiting central maw in the murky clouds below.

	<TEXT>  No! I'm done reading all the main ones from here! I thought this was the last one! Please, pretty please, continue this epic saga of worlds, monsters and strife, it is awe-inspiring, fantastical and yet engrained in certain truths about human behaviour, and it's hitting home hard! I don't just want more, I need it!

The next post is Wednesday at 6 :) I will absolutely continue these come hell or high water. In addition, some new stories come out at random times. You can follow updates at [my blog](http://mattdymerski.com/) or [my Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MattDymerskiAuthor/).

 Will you release your works as hardbook copies at a time where you're happy with it? I don't have a bookshelf yet, but I'm inclined to make one for this.

I actually have several done so far - in the Multiverse series, that would be Portal in the Forest through the Moon Aflame. I am working on "I think I may have missed the end of the world"; there's a bit of a time lag because of the immense of editing work involved. You can find those [on my Amazon list](http://www.amazon.com/Matt-Dymerski/e/B00A82LSW4/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1462656246 sr=8-1). Hope you enjoy them! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm glad you enjoy them! I'm actually putting together Noah's stories into book format right now and they're absolutely massive. I realized that random readers won't have any idea what's going on unless I include The House Beyond the Edge series and possibly the Back Paths series... so the book is like triple size, and I've been editing it for months. There's definitely some sort of irony there given the nature of the events in "I think I may have missed the end of the world." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So my question is this: Remember the cave that splits timelines and copies things. Is that cave a result of Noah having to exist? Like, Noah needs to exist to tell the stories, and the only way he could survive that cave was through a quantum duplication shenanigan, so the cave was previously just inhabited by a monster, and then Noah kind of 'broke' it? Or am I perhaps reading too deeply into things.

The cave was actually just the spider creature's den. The quantum duplication rift was a nearby canyon;it preyed upon those duplicates that came out later. [These guys have a pretty good take on it.](http://forest.wolfnexus.net/wiki/index.php/Quantum_Duplication_Rift/cleft)

But I like your thoughts on the dark side of gwellions and these tales being told. I can't confirm or deny anything due to spoilers, but that question is definitely a theme that has always been with us.

 Anyways, I love your writing, and it's a highlight of my week every time you post.

Thanks a ton! I'll try to keep you entertained! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Hey I know I'm two months late, but I just wanted to comment that you have quickly become one of my favorite writers. I'm trying to stay one series behind your posts so I don't reach a point where I'll have to wait for more. You're writing is so incredibly engaging and I love how complex and relatable your characters are. Please don't ever stop writing.

Thanks! I'll try to keep it up!

 Have you ever changed the direction of a story based on something a commenter guessed was going on? Or is the basic plot already laid out by the time you post the first part of a new series? I'm curious as to how flexible your story writing is.

I have many points of the basic plot outlined, but I absolutely love seeing what theories commenters come up with. I definitely shift towards characters they end up relating to more, or explore routes and questions they want to see. One of the most fun things about this genre and format is keeping one step ahead of astonishingly engaged and astute readers. 

The biggest changes in direction or focus come with the start of each new series. There are countless events happening all over the multiverse and we only get to see a small fraction of it; which fraction it is depends on where the audience wants it to go over the course of previous series.

In fact, this reminds me, I've been meaning to do a poll.

 Again, thanks for all the great content. I'll keep trying to share it with people who would enjoy it.

Awesome, thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Neil was unable to sleep or lose consciousness, but he was certainly able to despair in such deep darkness that he couldnt process where they were taking him. He may also have shouted some things hed later regret, but his was not the first agonized arrival to the Waystation, and the passing faces were understanding and solemn. Two men made signs of the cross when they realized what he had been seeking and what he had instead found.

In a cool space dominated by white, a brown blur blocked most of his vision. "I dont have any sedatives, so Im going to need you to calm down. Can you do that for me?"

After a moment of dazed exhaustion, he stopped struggling.

"Whats your name?"

He swallowed away hoarseness. "Neil."

"Nice to meet you, Neil. I'm Doctor Wygant. Im going to examine you. Can I lift this bandage on your head?"

Embarrassed for some reason, he mumbled, "I got shot."

"I can see that," she said compassionately. "Did the bullet come all the way out?"

"I think so."

She moved down and examined him for further injuries while she spoke. "You the guy that helped that family survive a night in the acid rain?"

Calming down as she spoke kindly to him, he asked, "How do you know about that?"

"Radios dont work near that massive rift, but we *do* have binoculars here, Neil."

"How come you guys didnt help?"

"We would haveby going and gathering all your bones once it was safe."

His face grew hot. "I guess it was pretty stupid of me to go down there."

"Lifes not so simple these days," she told him, her tone quiet. "Don't worry about what might have happened if you'd done something different. It's not worth it."

He tried to sit up, but she held him down lightly. He blurted, "My daughter and my friend are still out there."

"Theyll find their way here." Checking his bones, she squeezed down to his ankles. "You want us to send someone to help them?"

He nodded, causing the contents of his head to slosh about. "Theyre in a truck near the start of the high ridge road."

She moved quickly back to his face and touched a white cloth to his nose. She watched it for a moment before sighing with relief. "Well, youre not leaking important fluids. As long as its all still in there, wounds of any sort tend to heal pretty fast, since its just rearrangement rather than generating new biomass. I cant tell whats going on in that skull of yours, but you should be back to full health sooner than you expect."

Finally allowed up, he looked around the white-painted wooden shed. It had been decorated with clever approximations of items that might be found in a doctors office; none were legitimate, but it was the appearance of civilization that was important.

A doctor named Wygant "Say, you wouldnt happen to know an Edgar Brace, would you?"

Her professional smile fell. "Why?"

"He talks about a Mona Wygant sometimes." Now that he could focus more clearly on her face, he saw a real person: long dark hair tied up in a bedraggled bun, weathered glasses, and a pained expression. This was not just some distant name a friend had mentioned, and he realized he should have started this conversation with more tact. "But, um, the situation's rather complex."

"Yeah, I'll say." She moved away and carefully washed her blue plastic gloves in a vat of strange white liquid. "We've had three Edgar impersonators this month alone."

Neil opened his eyes wider as he began to process why people would do that. "To trick others into giving them food and stuff, because people know about youthey know your story, the Week of Hell."

She kept her eyes on her cleaning.

He imagined she must have had hope numerous times before only to be repeatedly disappointed by frauds. "I was there when he came back to life," he said, scooting off the table and standing. "It was a terrible place. An empty place. Is that where he died? Is that where you left him?"

She turned and glared at him from behind those scratched glasses. "That doesn't mean anything. Edgar died days before people started resurrecting en masse; possibly a week or more. There was only one major exception."

It felt like it was not really his place to have this conversation, but Neil also sensed that it was very important that he win her over, if only for Edgar's sake. "The first big group return we saw was outside the Zkirax tunnels. Nobody down there even had a clue that people were about to come back"

Her left hand closed reflexively as she interrupted him. "And Edgar was with you then?"

He nodded.

"How long?"

He tried to think back and calculate, but the endless trail had become a blur. "I dunno. A day or two?"

Her expression began to turn sour.

"No wait!" He traced the events in the air. "We hid in a canyon during a nearby battle, then we ran into Grayson, then we rode toward the Zkirax and camped when the gas ran out, and the next morning we got there by walking. It was *less than one day.* We were less than a day's ride from the insect world!"

She visibly refused to allow herself to be happy, but she did seem re-motivated. She grabbed his wrist and practically dragged him out of the medical shed. "The scammers usually assume, like most people do, that things are really far apart out here. In the stories they tell about our ride, we took routes that no longer exist. We're the only ones that know where things really happened. Not all of them were far apart."

He listened, but he also looked. The Waystation proper opened up as she pulled him along; a veritable castle wall had been built out of piled rock, forming a wide encampment against a leaning cliff that shot up to dizzying heights. The arrangement had been designed such that very little of the camp was visible from the outside, and also so that almost every conceivable angle was protected or overshadowed by cold unliving stone. Those areas that lay exposed to the skywhich his engineering sense judged as critical vulnerabilities, what with the acid rain and horrible entities passing throughwere carefully latticed and hinged with what he assumed was native wood. The result was a long twisted and shaded canyon that looked to house several hundred refugees in near bunker-like safety.

And not all of the shelters were tents. Dragged into what was more or less a *proper building*, albeit one crude and temporary in wooden construction, Neil marveled at the audacity of people like the ones at Concord farm or here at this Waystation. The act of building something was almost like a bet that the future would hold at least a modicum of stability, and they just kept betting despite the circumstances.

Someone had carved a wide waist-height table and placed it in the center of the main room. Small lights hung at intervals around the musty space; each had handles for manual charging, although Neil spotted a few wires here and there that were probably connected to solar panels outside. A family of refugees stood at one corner of the table, alternately explaining and pointing down at certain areas upon it, while several intent men and women took notes of what they said on paper and on a laptop. It was eerily similar to the welcome area back at Concord, and he immediately recognized it for what it was.

At seeing them enter, an attractive blonde woman with a cold and calculating expression waved away the family currently being debriefed. Neil looked away, but she stared him down nonetheless.

The doctor spoke first. "Tell Pixley here every step of your journey. It's part of what we do with everyone who passes through. We're trying to build a picture of what's happening."

"Alright." Neil began retelling his story while the woman used a carved stick to follow each major point of his trail along the map they'd built on the wide surface of the central table. Some regions were incredibly detailed, containing bits of clay molded and painted topographically, while some were more or less blank dull brown voids. For the first time, he was able to see a greater picture of where his family's wandering had taken them. In leaving the main path, they had avoided some very terrible dangers, but they had also wandered into the unknown areas. He was happy to fill in what he could, at least until the pointer touched upon a spot where someone had jabbed something into the faux earth as if angry or bitter. It was a subtle mark, given the visual complexity of the rest of the terrain, but he understood immediately. "And that's where I came across a dead body"

Pixley's attention wavered as regret crossed her elegant features.

"and it began to rain, and he jumped up and shouted about"

The long pointed stick leapt up to his throat. "He *what?*"

"He came back to life. He woke up. He ate worms with me."

The doctor cut in. "This is why I brought him in so quickly. I think he might be legit."

"When was this?" Pixley asked, her eyes sharp enough to pierce any lie. "Exactly what time?"

Neil held his palms up in deference to the menacing stick and gaze. "I honestly don't know. Somewhere in the early or middle part of the day."

The blonde looked to the man on the laptop, who responded, "Sir, even if we're generous and put it in the afternoon, it's still a distant outlier from the rest of the resurrection time data. He would have been the first person to resurrect by multiple days."

"I don't like it," Pixley murmured. "Edgar himself would have told us not to believe in coincidence."

"But what if it's true?" Doctor Wygant asked, her hands clasped.

"Should we believe that this guy" Pixley gestured in askance, nodded at the response, and continued. "that Neil here walks up to our Edgar and he just *pops up*, alive again, just like that, days before the rest of the species? What makes Edgar special? I cared about him, but he was just like you and me."

The doctor seemed simultaneously hopeful and heartbroken. "He did have a healing device in his stomach."

Feeling rather awkward, Neil raised his hand. When the two didn't immediately notice, he lifted it higher, feeling for all the world like a child back in school.

Pixley slowly stopped mid-sentence and redirected her attention. "Um, yes?"

He gave a sheepish frown. "There's more, actually."

"More?"

"We have a dead body."

"Alright? I'm sorry for your loss?"

"No, he, uh, is staying dead. And not healing."

The doctor visibly perked up into work mode. "What injuries?"

"Just a knife wound. Oh, and a shot or two to the limbs. But those weren't fatal. I, or, rather, he got stabbed, fell, and that was that."

"How long ago?"

"Yesterday morning."

"And that bodywhere is it?"

Neil gulped. "At the truck I told you about, with my daughter and my friend."

Wygant looked to Pixley, who nodded as if giving an unspoken order. The doctor hurried out without another moment's delay.

The blonde leaned her wrists on the smooth edge of the able and regarded him. "Well you're just full of surprises for us, aren't you? You were there when Edgar woke up supposedly *days* before anybody else, and now you're carting around the only human being we know of that has actually managed to die since this all began."

Feeling odd and somewhat defensive, Neil nevertheless volunteered what he had already told Doctor Wygant. "We were leaving the Zkirax tunnels, too, when they all began to wake up. We drove through them before anyone understood what was going on."

"Is that so."

"Yes. It *is*," he answered, despite her statement not having been a question.

She turned and gave a quiet order to someone behind her, but then seemed to lighten up after that. Delving into what sounded like more standard conversation, she exchanged as much information as possible. The region was roughly spherical with a devastated heart at the center, here depicted as several splayed semicircles which were not even remotely accurate but functioned well enough visually; she pointed to one side and indicated a blank region. "Her Glory has retreated here, perhaps coincidentally where the refugees are the sparsest. A few witnesses claim she's working on something enormous and terrifying, though they can't identify what it is. All we know is that the energy emissions from those realities are off the charts. Nothing works nearbyno rift compasses, no radio, nothing. Know anything about this? Even the most obscure details could mean life or death." She tilted her head briefly. "So to speak."

Neil shook his head.

"Alright." She moved the pointer to the other side, where a smattering of blanks and figurines marked some sort of army-controlled area. "The Grey Riders have captured several of her factories and fought the initial battles to what looks like a stalemate. We believe they put everything they had into these offensives, and that their appearance of strength is a ruse. They're probably actually maxed out, and desperate for any delay while they get the factories online. It helps that nobody has any clue who the hell they are, where they come from, or what they want, though we have some ideas. Have you seen anything related to this?"

At this, Neil grinnedand went on at length, discussing everything he'd seen and everything Edgar had considered before telling Grayson's tale.

"And Grayson's the one that yousorry, that *got* stabbed somehow or another, and is now not reanimating?"

Full of relief after telling someone what had happened and not being judged for it, he nodded slowly. It had been no easy task to shoot and stab a human being, even one so traitorous as Grayson. He had not liked the feel of it, and continued to find the repeating sense memories subtly traumatizing.

Pixley's gaze went distant. "Animals don't resurrect. Have you noticed that, Neil?"

"Yeah. I guess."

"Did the Zkirax resurrect?"

He took an unconscious half-step backwards. "No"

"So it would be safe to say just humans resurrect?"

"That seems to be the case."

Her face remained turned toward the distance, but her eyes jumped to his. "Did Grayson say or do anything that ever made you suspect he was something other than human?"

He took a conscious full step backwards as she asked the question he had already feared for several seconds. "No."

"In retrospect, maybe?"

"No."

"Alright. Just think about it."

There was some discussion of his spectacle earlier and who he had come to find, but there were no other Rani Yadavs in the lists of those who had come through.

"You're going to stay, aren't you?" Pixley asked as someone new entered. "Yeah, I can tell. The ones who intend to move on through the exit rift usually have a look of hopelessness or determination about them. The ones who are still waiting for someone are lost in between."

He had no response. He certainly felt exactly that.

The newcomer was a fit Asian man with an automatic rifle slung around his back. "Yao," he said, offering his hand for a shake before saying, "Let's go."

Neil hesitated, but the look in the blonde commander's eyes made it clear that he had already been assigned. He followed the soldier out of the tent and across the busy and dusty main area of the Waystation.

"You know how to shoot?" Yao asked, opening a standalone metal cabinet that had been bolted to the rock. He took out some ammo and a handgun.

"A little bit," Neil answered honestly. He accepted the handgun and, as Edgar had taught him, made sure that it wasn't loaded. "What are the chances, do you think, of a lost loved one coming here? Does it happen often?"

Yao did not like that question, nor did he answer it.

Together, they went on a walk around the perimeter of the Waystation's huge piled rock walls, and Neil began wondering what their objective was. Was he really just one of the guards now? This Yao guy certainly wasn't about to open up and tell him more.

They passed a huge man in ragged clothing whose large patches of burned skin looked like they had only recently begun to heal. With a bitter expression, he carried a comically oversized rock to the walls of the 'Station, carefully deposited it, and then went back to the base of the cliffs for another.

"Holy crap," he asked quietly. "Did that guy build these walls all by himself?"

Yao did not like that question either, and merely glared.

Willfully oblivious to their presence, the scarred man sat and hung his sweat-dripping head in his reddened hands.

As the two of them moved out of sight of him, Yao murmured, "We lost a lot of people out here. A lot of family, and *loved ones.* Don't ask again."

Nodding respectfully, he remained quiet the rest of the walkat least until they came to a secluded half-cave that held a pool of lingering rainwater and Yao pushed him toward it. Slipping down the rocky scree, Neil shouted in anger and fear, but they had moved far enough away that nobody could hear him. "What the hell are you doing?!"

"That's acid," Yao stated flatly. "Best not fall in." He lowered a boot and kicked.

Hit in the face, Neil slid down further and gripped a jutting rock; swinging above the pool of acid, he tried to hang on with one arm and fumble for his handgun.

Yao anticipated that. Slinging the rifle around, he brought it to bear. "That won't work."

Running on sheer adrenaline, he managed to start climbing a little higher; Yao took a shot or two, and the rocks above cracked. Neil braced himself for the pain as he fell directly backwards into the pooled liquid.

It was icy at firstbut the burning never came. After a few moments of shouting and panic, he stood awkwardly and slogged out of the cold water. "It's not acid?"

Yao shook his head.

"What the hell *was* this?"

"What do you think it was?"

Standing in place, bedraggled, and breathing hard, Neil ran through the possibilities until he understood. "A test to see if I did anything weird to avoid the acid, because your commander thought it was suspicious I was at certain places."

Yao nodded. "That, and sometimes we test random people. We could really use another Her Glory; one that's on our side."

"Hate it to break it to you," Neil countered, angry mainly because of the embarrassment. "I'm not a reality bender or whatever. I *wish.*" He stalked away over the rocks.

"Plus it's funny," Yao added, grinning after him.

The soldier did catch up to him, but they walked in amused and grumpy silence for the rest of the patrol. Upon their return to the front gate, Neil saw Showman waiting with Kumari in hand. Never more relieved to see his daughter, he rushed forward and scooped her up; she laughed happily and pulled at his unkempt hair.

Yao watched without saying a word, but watch he did.

Handed off to a white-haired older woman as sunset neared, Neil, Showman, and Kumari proceeded deeper into the tight canyons of the refuge, where more hanging charged lights provided a dim ambient glow. Ducking in to a low-ceilinged shed, Neil came up short as he saw their fourth and final bunkmate. "Um, hello."

The other Rani gave a sheepish and apologetic shrug as Kumari positively squealed with glee.

Asking so that his friend would not have to, Showman turned to the old woman that had guided them. "Has there been a mistake? She's not the person we're looking for."

"No mistake," the old woman said with a grin. "Baby."

"No, that's not Kumari's mother."

"New baby," the woman insisted. "Make baby with same before, so high chance with this one." She leaned into the shed and spoke to Neil as if *he* was the one with communication issues. "Make baby, highest calling now."

Neil understood. It was not the first time he had heard that sentiment. He could also directly sense the cold and calculating hand of that blonde commander at work in such a decision. They'd been assigned this shed and assigned the other Rani on purpose. The higher ups couldn't directly order it, but such things had a habit of working themselves out in close quarters; he immediately resolved to never ever let that happen.

But they sat in the dark and shared quiet stories of the long road, and it was hard not to hear his wife in this Rani's duplicate voice and mannerisms while Kumari pulled at her hair and giggled. After the others finally went to sleep, he lay awake with an aching heart and dwelled on what he had lost. How was it that his Rani had not yet come to Concord or the Waystation? Godswas she in the Zkirax tunnels? He almost sank into a spiral of depression before her voice came as a whisper in the private darkness of the night.

"Neil, are you awake?"

He hesitated before deciding to reply. "Yes."

"On my world, I married your cousin. That's how I have your last name."

"Deepak?"

"No, Mike."

He growled. "I knew that bastard had eyes for you. Even at our wedding" He cut himself off.

Instead of dwelling on his mistake, she whispered, "He died at the Capital Temple."

"Oh." He swallowed audibly, now feeling like an asshole. "Are you alone out here, then?"

Kumari was in a tiny bed all on her own and Showman was behind them; the space was cramped enough that he could feel her nod in the dark. "I was going to move on through the rift," she told him. "I had nothing left to stay here for. But I coulduntil you find her. Your me. Kumari's wonderful, and I don't mind."

What would be in Kumari's best interests? She wouldn't remember these years of her life, but he'd read parenting books, and losing her mother at this age was a very bad thing. This Rani was not their Rani, but this Rani had her voice and face, and that was a unique opportunity most other children didn't get. "Alright"

He doubted his decision, but only until beams of grey morning light shining through the gaps in the wooden walls of the shed stirred him out of his sleepless death-slumber and he saw Kumari sleeping soundly and happily in the other Rani's arms. He covered his face then, and sobbed silently for all that they had been through. They were finally safe. Behind him, Showman stirred, but pretended to still be asleep.

It was, at first, impossible to comprehend just what safety and stability meant. There were no more days spent walking, no more rifts, and no more wild changes in scenery. He didn't have to hold Kumari every hour of every day for fear of the multiverse, and he had a friend and pseudo-family to help take care of her. More than that, this place had resources, and, while on daily patrol, he thought often about how best to communicate with the farms and the tunnels to try to find his Rani.

His first stark reminder that the one he had was not his own came when he ran into a loud redheaded engineer by pure luck. Ellwood passed him with another engineer while he was readying for patrol, and he struck up a conversation and got his duties shifted over. In the course of that talk, he found out that this Rani had something of a friendship with the redhead. He returned to the shed that night and tried to figure out how to handle that; his wife had been a merciless and ambitious networker, but this Rani had somehow never seen fit to mention to the Waystation's head engineer that he himself had the perfect skillset and field experience for being on that team rather than patrolling like a common soldier! It wasn't an ego thing, not in the least, but he still felt struck in the heart and confused.

He shouldn't have mentioned it. He knew he shouldn't have. He tried not to say anything. He tried to keep the hurt to himselfbut one of the first things human beings seemed to do in any vaguely stable situation was create stills, and then alcohol. He blurted it out the first night he'd been drunk since the farm realities, and it was her turn to feel struck in the heart and confused.

When he awoke the next morning in nauseous and regretful agony, she was still in the adjacent bunk, but her manner ever after was subtly colder. He also realized that his waking meant that he had slept, which itself meant that he was finally alive again. It was, strangely, a paltry consolation.

Once on the engineering team, he became privy to more of the camp's information through Ellwood, and he learned that they had stashed Grayson's body in a locked shed. He had not revived, and continued to decay. At times he visited the corpse, if only to peer in through the small rectangular gap in the door and make sure the son of a bitch was still rotting.

Although the higher ups tried to hide it, this became a serious note of contention in those first few weeks. Many wanted to die, but could not. They asked: how had it happened? Was it the knife? Was it the place? Was it something special about Neil himself? Others journeyed out and tried the place, but returned still alive. Some begged and pleaded and whined; eventually Neil tearfully gave in and stabbed one, who did not die.

The attention of these dead refugees moved on as they did. Every few days, when it seemed safest, whole groups moved on together into the next base branch of the multiverse whose edge began here. It was not one-way for that reason; it was one-way by virtue of the horrendous threats that bashed their way through as frequently as multiple times a day. Without radio contact, there was no way for refugees on the other side to coordinate a safe return. During these times of threat, those at the Waystation battened the hatches and hid in their citadel of rock. Few dangers gave them the slightest care, for the preternatural cold, Her Glory's machines, the Grey Rider's armies, and other scattered menaces that the Devastation had slung through the region were all fantastic reasons not to linger for a few well-armored morsels.

All this Neil learned in the first three weeks. That third Saturdayfor this place had days of the week now that he was stationary and stableDoctor Wygant returned joyously from Concord farm with confirmation that Edgar was, in fact, still alive. This news seemed to move the strange scarred man on the outskirts of town; he finally put down his Sisyphean self-punishment and wordlessly came inside to rest. It was good that he did, for the titanic tentacled aberration that had destroyed the China of Neil's world came calling the next night. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Upon a roofless cathedral of pipes and walkways, distant wrenches beat a simple but rising rhythm of anticipation as oil-spattered men challenged us to succeed. We splashed down canals of metal between those populated walls while gears shifted in the unseen world; in the narrow gap of sky above, red stars pierced purple haze above seven beams of dark blue light whose path we mirrored beneath. I had but a brief moment to take this in, for the wrenches reached a crescendo, the rumbling stopped, and a released black and emerald spectral torrent made itself known behind us in the trench.

Guy was not afraid. He ran as fast as he could and pulled ahead; I was the one to question how this was possible. We had not been able to truly run in the previous two layers of dream. Something of the blur and haze of imagination had left us. We were slightly more real than before.

Workmen lifted us up just before the noxious tide reached us. They laughed, clapped us on the shoulders, and then pointed the way. Miffed, Guy shrugged off their hazing ritual and took the lonely metal path they had indicated. I hurried after, keeping my gaze sharp for anything new. Were the laborers here dream-folk like those blurry-faced denizens of the city of bronze and gold? These men had clear features and tired eyes. I suspected they might be real, but had no guess as to their tasks.

Deeper into the citadel of steel, we found a raised platform where those in charge coordinated many various lights and sounds that approximated broken images of computers. If a blind man drew and a deaf man composed, their collaboration would have produced an equally disjointed device. I tried not to look.

We were led to the edge of open air and left to handle what shipments might come. Boss did not explain further than that, for these high circular loading docks were obvious in function. Once alone, Guy and I cautiously did a sweep of the area and gazed both up and down the outside of the citadel. Above, staggeringly complex pipes and machinery formed towering walls that were impenetrable save for those seven slicing beams of blue that dominated the purple sky; below, metal ended and carved stone began, running down to the desert floor a dizzying distance below. It took me several minutes to understand what we were seeing.

"Look!" I said quietly, pointing down. "That's a nose. And those are eyebrow slopes."

"Does it mean something to you, Porter?"

"It's an ancient stone face, just like the one back on that island that pointed the way toward our blue path in the ocean. They built this factory on top of it."

Guy gazed out onto the vast featureless desert. "And it's facing the way the ships will come."

I pointed up. "And toward the source of the blue beams."

There was not yet any way to know what it meant, but we kept our eyes open and did our jobs. The ships came at irregular intervals. These were still of wood, but, unlike our previous locale, these sailed upon the air itself with nothing more than a whisper. There were no engines; they grew larger in our vision swiftly and quietly, propelled directly underneath those massive blue beams as if somehow attachedand yet they were not attached, for they moved of their own volition when docking, and later when sailing off to the east and west rather than returning to the south.

Of the crew, all were real men. They helped us load crates onto conveyors and then lingered to have a smoke and exchange complaints about football and the weather. Guy often offered his lighter, but never smoked himself.

In this new position, we spent another month. Beside me, Guy obtained an edge of anger and adrenaline, while I found an odd calm in the high desert winds. Between ships, we waited in silence, and I watched the hazy purple sky. Were the stars red because of the atmosphere here? If so, what was it made of? How could we breathe it? These were questions of exploration and wonder my suspicious and calculating mind had rarely entertained before. Perhaps that seed of hope budding behind my ribs was beginning to grow. There was *so much more* than I had ever known. How could I

In my distraction, we dropped a crate mid-transfer. It soared down, shrinking, tumbling, impossibly still falling as we all watched for nearly a minute, and I cursed.

"It happens every so often," Boss told us as she led Guy, me, and four other men to a secret hatch among the pipes. "Don't sweat it. We'll just have to go retrieve it ourselves." Rolling the wheel and popping the hatch open, she ducked down into stone caverns, and we entered tunnels within the giant stone head upon which our factory had been built.

Neither of us had possessed even an inkling that tunnels existed within that carved base. Again I began to wonder in the manner of an awed child: who had built this stone face here? What tools had they used to carve and place such a titanic work? And why had they infested it with cramped tunnels that seemed slightly too small for all but Boss? I focused on these questions to avoid feeling claustrophobic even as the rock continued to shrink around us almost imperceptibly slowly.

I was last in line, and Guy was ahead of me, pushing forward at determined speed. For a brief time, I greatly feared losing the line and wandering these tunnels for eternitybut we came to hewn stairs, and the space finally opened up to allow us to move and breathe more easily. That feeling of freedom faded as exhaustion set in. Hour upon hour, we slapped our boots on worn stone. I remembered with dismay how long it had taken for that crate simply to fall to the sand. We had to walk that distance downward now, and this particular dream world kept distances concrete and solid. There was no skipping ahead due to lack of landmarks.

Something clicked in my thoughts: they'd chosen this dream world for the factory for exactly that reason. Physics was slightly more real here, and that was probably vital for mechanical works and processing chemicals. I felt triumphant as we finally reached the bottom; I had just peeled back one small layer of the unknowable organization we faced.

Yes, the physical laws were far more real here. We slogged through the sand, miserable as a group. In just a few steps, it was in my boots and socks, and it began working its way into my pockets, under my nails, and on my hair. This was a Desert with a capital D; the dunes were ten times the height of a man, and the wind swept the clinging particles along like mud streams at the bottom of a recently disturbed lake.

The crate was already half-buried at the top of one such high dune. I paused a few steps behind the rest of the group and gazed upward. I'd been right; wearing a crown of intricate metal, the titanic carved face watched the distant southern horizon with vacant eyes.

There was no way to get the crate itself back up there. Instead, Boss took a count of the inventory inside and had us stuff our pockets with bags of liquid and powder chemicals while carrying the remainder in our arms. "Keep an eye on each other," she warned. "If even a single bag goes missing, you'll *all* suffer greatly."

That gave Guy and me pause. We looked to each other, and then at the other men, who were equally glancing around with suspicion. So busy as we were with glaring, we didn't see the approaching wave until it was too late.

Neon fuchsia exploded around us as the blasting wave of color erupted into vibrant monochromatic life. Where there had been sand, there were now flowers; we stumbled along in the mass of life, which I saw to be the same painful neon from stem to petal. These flowers were not growing in the sandeverything beneath us had *become* a morass of stems as complicated as the pipes of the factory crown high above us. That weathered stone face looked on, ignoring us as we screamed and clawed our way forward while trying not to sink into the quickflowers.

"Leave the product!" Boss shouted. "*Survive!*"

Some of the men yelled for us to flatten out, and Guy and I gripped hands and used the added weight to extract ourselves from the breezy depths. Crawling along on our stomachs, flowers in our faces, we crept toward the stone landing where the steps to safety lay. Out of the neon fuchsia emerged a single searingly yellow sunflower. Boss stared for a beat until it puffed spores in her face. She rolled to the side, unconscious.

Each of us saw it happen. A moment of sheer panic clasped all of our muscles; Guy roared, "*Knives!*"

Given the ability to defend ourselves, we each whipped out our knives and began slicing away any sign of yellow the instant it appeared before our eyes. Crawling away from the slowly fleeing group, I approached our unconscious Boss; groveling before that impassive stone face with its industrial crown like it was an uncaring king and I was a desperate peasantunder those seven blue beams, domed by purple haze and red stars, and beset by neon fuchsia and deadly yellowmy awareness began to crack. I had breathed in some of the spores.

Guy crawled up next to me, and, together, we dragged Boss with us. Barely reaching hard stone with her limp body, we collapsed among the other exhausted men and lay breathing and recovering. Like the much smaller stone face back on that island, this stone was *real*; we'd made a grave mistake in relying on anything else to remain constant, even in this particular dream world. This reality was *more real* than other dreams, but still not *real real*, like the stone of this weathered watcher. This stone would not change; they had chosen the location for their factory well.

But we were not all present. Looking around as my spinning awareness began to settle, I realized we were one short. One man had not made it back. We gazed out in horror at the quickflowers, but they were already fading back into sand, and we had no way of knowing where he had sunk or how deep he had gone. He would be crushed and suffocating even then as an endless mass of breezy stems became solid sand once againa beautiful but horrible way to die.

Boss seemed somber. Leaning on her arm and staring at the dunes, she said, "If he remembered his training, he'll have taken his caffeine overdose pill and tried to wake up. He might have made it."

But the flowers had *knocked us unconscious within a dream.* The disturbing implications of that ability haunted me on our long walk back up the tunneling steps. This place was more real than other dreams; was that how we'd been able to be affected so? I think everyone knew he'd sunken into those flowers while passed out. There had been no chance to use a caffeine pill.

Boss hadn't been awake for our rescue, but she knew what had happened. Once we reached the factory again and the other men went back to work with solemn unhappiness, she pulled the two of us aside. "What's with you two?"

After exchanging a glance with Guy, I asked, "What do you mean?" I was also suddenly aware, with her close, that she was rather ridiculously beautiful. Raven haired, pale-skinned, and a bit ghastly and direct in manner, she was a ghoulish and capable woman maybe five years older than I was. I had never really looked at her before, in the same way that I had never really looked at most people.

"You should have left me to die," she told us. "That's the procedure I set out for all my employees here. Caffeine pills as a last resort, strict protocols never to go anywhere alone, and direct orders not to risk yourselves for other people. I'm trying to keep you young punks alive out here."

Guy reacted negatively. "If we hadn't done that, you'd be dead now!"

She moved threateningly close and stood taller than him for a moment. "*You don't know if I'm real.* None of us know if anyone else here is real. You may have risked your life for a figment of your imagination."

That stunned him into silence.

She sighed. "We don't usually hire anything but scum who are more than happy to ditch their colleagues. You two are too good to stay here. Sorry, but you gotta go."

Guy's silence ended as quickly as it had begun. "What? No! Iwe"

I held up a hand. "Relax, Guy. She means she's promoting us."

She grinned, displaying two perfect wide rows of bone-white teeth. "You're failing up, boys."

We helped unload the next ship that came in from the south, and then replaced its cargo with our presence. The crew paid us no mind, for Boss went with us to ensure our arrival at the other end would go smoothly. "It's no bother," she said. "I consider it a vacation to get out of that steel hellhole for a night."

Tracking below the seventh and easternmost blue beam, we sailed the skies over that quiet and endless desert. It was only now that I was leaving that I had the wherewithal to realize that I had never seen the sun or daylight here; it had always been purple-hazed and red-starred night. Now that I was aware of that oddity, I also noticed that I'd never seen a moon. My first impression of the place had been colored by the rising moon I had seen behind the Glass Gateway that had led us here.

I leaned on the railing and watched that crowned stone face recede into the distance. From this angle, it finally seemed to be paying attention to me. From this angle, it looked concerned for my fate. Strange that it would only now try to warn us, and not when we were running around inside its unmoving innards or dying beneath its chin.

Guy joined me at the rail to watch the factory shrink on the horizon. Boss leaned there, too, though I hadn't noticed her arrival. She breathed in the sweet-scented purple air and closed her eyes for several heartbeats.

"Better than the air back at the factory," I joked, but she turned and looked at me with utter seriousness.

"Yes. It is. You boys better treasure what you have while you have it. Everything smells tainted of smoke to me."

Guy and I looked at her; for a brief moment, we saw her as she truly was: twice as old, gums rotting, skin sagging, hair falling out, lungs weak, heart dying. The image vanished, and she was disgustingly beautiful once more.

"You're never going back to real life, are you?" Guy asked.

She shook her head. "Life's no kind of life when you're hooked up to machines all day. And yet" She laughed and gestured back at the oily, dirty, and smoky factory that was now far out of sight.

I knew Guy was going to impulsively ask her to come with us, then; to escape that second cruel prison of technology and join us on our journey, but I shook my head, and he fell silent. We had a mission*his* missionand complications would only endanger our chances of rescuing his friend.

I'd been wrong about the moon, though. This place did have oneit just didn't move. As the curve of the earth fell away, we sailed under that blue beam and deeper into the sky, approaching a disk that slowly became whiter as we grew closer in the purple haze. Those seven shafts shot straight toward it unwavering, their only motion that constant glimmer of strings within strings that beams of silent light held as part of their innate visual music.

The moon grew ever larger. Our speed increased. Guy and I gripped the rails while the crew worked at a frenzied pace and Boss raised her arms with excitement.

As the acceleration became overpowering and lunar white filled our vision, Guy screamed, "Are we going to smash into it?"

"*Through!*" Boss yelled back.

A vast caldera opened before us, and we followed our lone beam deep into a tremendous crack in the skin of the moon itself. Darkness fell, blacker than any simple absence of light, and only that pulsating blue above lit our hands before our eyes. Ahead, a whirling void flared into existence, and the ship sailed toward it as we clutched carved wood and hoped with all our inner animal desperation that we would survive whatever was about to happen. We had earned our way to a deeper layer of dreamone closer to our goalbut I had the distinct sense we were going to dislike our prize very much.

And then the blackest black was past, and we sailed through mere gloom. Ahead, a palace of light hung from the shadows above, and the ship pulled slowly up to a dock visible only by its shimmering white outlines; while the crew dry heaved and clutched their stomachs, Guy and I vomited over the side. Inglorious, yes, but we'd survived the transition to something strange, foul, and wondrous.

Or perhaps *survived* was not the word. Boss led us forward to a waiting figure on that outline in light; that dock that both did exist and did not exist. "I'm not your Boss anymore, boys," she said, her tone proud and sad.

This time there was no avoiding his piercing ruby gaze.

The silhouette of Death awaited us with folded hands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  As I understand it, this AMA is permanently(-ish?) ongoing,

100%!

 First, how does it feel to know that people are still, to this day, discovering even your earlier works and getting so readily hooked, some (such as myself) even comparing you favorably to the likes of Stephen King and HP Lovecraft? 

It's amazing. I've always wanted to be a writer and I've always intended to create mythology-sized frameworks that stand the test of time the same way my favorite authors did, so seeing that begin to come to fruition after so many years of hard work is extremely rewarding. It takes some effort to make stories timeless (by avoiding specific pop culture references and technologies) but it's all worth it.

 And second, I'm an aspiring writer, though I've never gotten more than a chapter or two out due to the crushing fist of real life and the intimidation of tackling such a big project; horror and sci-fi are my go-to. Is your multiverse still open to outside writers,

Absolutely! Ask me any questions if you need, as well.

  have there been any new developments in the 'ground rules' for 'playing with your toys' since you initially laid them out back then, 

Nope, I plan to keep the ground rules pretty much the same for a very long time.

 and what advice would you offer an aspiring writer such as myself?

I think by what you said that you've only ever gotten a chapter or two out due to the constraints of life and the intimidation of big projects, the most relevant advice right now is to *just write.*

Set a certain goal of words every weekday and have a 'writing hour' (or whatever strategy works for you). The key is that you make writing that certain number of words non-negotiable with your inner self so that it does not attempt to weasel out of the deal or procrastinate. Six years ago when I started all this, I was at 500 words a day, and that was tough to reach. Now I write 5000 a day and it takes 3-5 hours and doesn't drain me nearly as much as it used to. Writing's a muscle like any other, and you need to work it out. It provides geometric returns; often the stories you see posted here were thought about for six days and written in one. Today's story was nearly 6000 words and I sat down at 2 pm, executed the mental course I'd thought about all week, and put it together by 6 pm. Quick clickers might notice me live editing in the first half hour after something's posted... lol. Note sheets of idea puzzle pieces to use speed up the process a lot. If you know where you're going and with what elements, writing is just coloring in the lines.

That's where you can get by writing a bit each day. Eventually, it'll be fun and easy, not hard and mentally tiring.

And don't worry about your writing being good. It's always fantastic to somebody. I say this literally as part of my marketing advice to authors I help publish: as long as your ideas are sound, the structural quality of your writing only affects the size of your potential market and how hard you'll have to search for the right demographic. The most atrocious grammatical writer in the world will still have fans *somewhere*, because there are 8 billion interconnected people on this planet and they're all very different. I worked with one girl who wrote stream of consciousness stories with no coherent grammatical structure at all, but her books sold very well when they were translated into Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, because - well, honestly I can only guess and go off of what other people say, since I don't speak those languages, but you never know where your writing will fit. Just make sure your ideas are sound.

 EDIT: Also, would like to add that, most recently, as well as the "I was told..." series, I finished reading several of the older stories (not the 'oldest', but the Back Paths series, Fountain of Youth, and the chronicles of Noah Fulmer's youth's adventuring), and I am seriously impressed. This is one of the reasons I've taken to comparing you to King, the way you tie in all the threads from the older stories, even if they don't look connected, much like sai King has done with the Dark Tower multiverse.

Thanks! It's a ton of fun for me to leave those hidden connections and watch people decipher them. It's like watching *Lost* but being on the other side of the discussion and squealing every time a fan posts the right theory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Neil wiped his nose for the third time in ten minutes. Was it spinal fluid, or just allergies? Not being able to tell the difference had left him constantly disconcerted during the drive, but it was now time to focus; he brought the truck to a stop as dappling hints of rain appeared on the windshield and then faded just as quickly as they had come. Curling around to see how Showman was doing in the back, Neil spoke to his friend as the other man sat warily guarding Graysons corpse. How do we wanna do this?

The valley below held a spread of jumbled plant life and damaged earth. In some patches, the ancient treetops reached nearly to the height from which they stood surveying; in others, massive gulches had been torn through the forest. The devastation seemed random and frenetic, but the surviving half of the primordial forest hid whatever cause lurked below.

The wispy clouds had dissipated for the moment. The sun stood directly overhead.

I know how wed do this if we had plenty of time, Showman offered with a frown.

Neil forced his foot to stop tapping the untrodden stone that marked the terminating ledge of their vantage point. Every heartbeat felt like a potential footstep Rani might be taking out into the forever unknown. I cant ask you to risk your life doing this the hard way with me.

Showman peered at the distant piled rocks that marked what could only have been the perimeter of the Waystation. Normally Id say Im with you, mate, but you happen to be right. We dont have to cross this mess with Kumari. You just have to get to Rani anaveer come back.

For the tenth time in as many minutes, Neil glanced at the truck, where he continually feared Grayson would somehow wake and take Kumari hostage at any moment. There was a refugee-dotted road that curved around the opposite rocky high points of the valley, but it was still new, and no place for a truck. The prospect of driving down through the forestor of carrying Kumari through unknown dangerseemed iffy. The only alternative was still daunting, but not as scary as the thought of losing Rani forever. Ill have to do this alone.

Lowering his head respectfully for what was likely about to happen, Showman said nothing.

If I dont come back

Ill take Kumari to Concord. London to a brick Casey'll make sure shes taken care of.

Neil nodded and breathed in hard against the traces of spinal fluid still leaking down his nose. The prospect of what might lie in the moments ahead had sent his pulse racing, and odd pressures throbbed in his skull where blood had pooled uncomfortably. He pushed away thoughts of his damaged brain; all that mattered now was reaching Rani. He lifted his handheld radio and tried to contact the Waystation again, but the only response was the same strange squealing static that had dominated the channels for the last several hours. Just like the forest below, something was very wrong, but there was no telling exactly what. It was time to break out the special equipment.

Grayson had been right in thinking the crates contained valuable technology, but hed been wrong about them being weapons. Lifting open one of the two crates, Neil silently thanked his friend eight centuries gone as he took the strange wire-and-coil belt out into the noon sunlight. Edgar had specifically asked Wes to try find something he had witnessed himself; supposedly this prototype Intelligent Barrier could project a protective sphere of light that would keep the wearer safe from one threat at a time for up to thirty minutes. Neil clicked it around his waist and experimentally hit the switch at the front buckle. He knew intellectually that some sort of white light would emerge, but he still jumped and shut it back off immediately after the ten-foot-wide sphere blinked into existence. It works!

Showman grinned. Not bad. Just use that battery sparingly. He lifted his own handheld. Ill be your eyes in the sky. Try to stay where I can see ahead. Line of sight will be important for the radio, too, what with the interference.

That gulch there work?

Yeah. What is that, an hours jog?

I have no idea. How do you estimate that kind of thing?

Its about an hour. Trust me.

Neil took a few deep breaths in attempt to calm himself. So I can use the belt roughly half of the run.

Right.

Is this a bad idea?

Yeh, but its for love. So its the only idea that matters.

Feeling like he was about to die, Neil wanted to say something more, but his friend already knew, and there was no time. He was at that moment clinking up the first hill of a rollercoaster, and the cars had just begun to hit the crest. He wanted to scream. Instead, he kept his needed breath and started down the steep hill beside the ledge before he had a chance to second-guess himself. It was too sharp an incline to climb back directly. There was no going back now.

Lean back! Steady your angle! Showman shouted.

Half-panicked, but bringing his inner focus to bear, Neil adjusted his stance as he bounced and leapt down the sloped rock. It wouldn't do to come all this way just to fall and break a few limbs for no reason. Stumbling down the long scree and into the trees proper, he grabbed branches to slow his descent and regain control. After that, he skirted his way around the denser foliage and found a torn gulch where Showman could see ahead for any threats.

His radio crackled with slight static. "Clear for a bit. Nothing moving."

Now that he was in the mess, Neil discovered that the downed trees were far more of an impediment than he'd expected. Waves of uprooted clay had formed into easy hills, but their accompanying trunks had fallen into a splintery and unstable obstacle course. Already beginning to sweat under the thick bandage around his head, he climbed his way carefully over a particularly slippery log and then paused as sudden shade brought blessed relief from the heat. His heart sank as he watched roiling clouds wash across the sky overhead in a thick wave. "You seeing this?"

"Just keep moving," Showman radioed back. "You'll get there before the weather turns."

Trying to find a balance between haste, awareness, and precision, Neil moved across another several hills and piles of trunks while keeping an eye out on the dimming woods to either side of his path. Something had torn its way through here not too long ago, and there was every chance it or some other threat still remained. If

His foot slipped down in between three oddly wedged broken trunks. Trying to recover, he pulled up, but his worn shoe had gotten caught somehow. As he tugged, he began to realize something horrible: this would be an impossible journey without both shoes, but slipping it off to free his foot would drop the shoe into the unreachable depths of the tree jam. "This doesn't happen in real life," he shouted at his shoe. "This only happens in movies!"

But his shoe had never seen a movie, and refused to budge.

Darker light subtly shifted into lighter darkness as the wind began to pick up. Behind him, something tremendous snapped, and he reflexively hit the switch on his belt and ducked. The impact was quieter than it should have been, all things considered, but he still looked up in shock at the fallen trunk that sat atop shimmering light not five feet overhead. "Showman, I think these damn trees have it out for me! And I'm stuck."

"Stuck?"

"I can't get my shoe out of these logs."

"I'd throw you mine, but you're too far away, even from this height."

Ambient electrical charge made the hair on the back of Neil's neck rise as he pulled at different angles with his leg and stared warily at the heavy trunk bearing down on his barrier. Every moment was a further drain on the device, and a further risk that Rani might move on.

"Hold on," Showman radioed. "Someone's coming."

Peering out through white-lit shrouding branches, Neil watched as several figures made their way down the rocky inclines below the long encircling path to the Waystation. Thanks to the activation of his barrier, he had become a glowing beacon in the growing gloom, and other travelers had seen his plight. His heart raced for action, but there was nothing he could do but wait.

The shout came as the first figure toiled over nearby logs and into sight. "Oi! Bit of a pickle?"

"You could say that," he yelled back.

The stocky and red-faced Englishman was the first to reach him and study his situation. "What's all this then?"

"It's a barrier that keeps out one threat at a time. Don't touch the light or the tree might fall."

The other man accepted his explanation with nothing more than a dry nod. A woman, a teenage boy, and two children soon appeared outside the branches. "Alright, let's push this tree off 'im first. Don't get near the light."

Thankful more than he could ever express, Neil waited as the helpful family managed to slide the fallen trunk away with their combined effort. With that gone, he was able to click off his belt to save the battery, and one of the children climbed into an astonishingly small gap under the trees to retrieve his shoe after he kicked it off and freed his grimy sock and foot.

The kid climbed out with a grin bigger than her face should have been able to hold. "Here, mister."

"Thanks! You guys are a miracle."

"This go to the Waystation?" the woman asked, pointing up the path.

He nodded. "Hour's jog."

The Englishman clapped his shoulder. "Then you can pay us back by goin' ahead and runnin' afoul of all the dangers first, since you seem to know what you're doing." He glanced back the way they had come. "And we can't exactly climb back out of here now."

Only then realizing what this family had risked to help a complete stranger, Neil tightened the laces on his shoe and accepted their request. "I don't have much with me, but I'll leave" He looked down at his stained and travel-worn layers that had been vital against the cold. "one of my shirts on a branch if I see anything dangerous."

"That'll work."

And off he went, running with greater confidence now that he knew someone could catch up and free him if he got stuck again. Rather than climbing carefully over the intermittent trunk piles, he leapt up and down from log to log, surprised to find that it was actually easier, safer, and faster to keep his contact to each relegated to a single stepthere was no chance for any given log to slip, break, or fall further. Was this how confident people like Edgar pulled off the impossible? Were there secret returns inherent in existence that rewarded bold and risky action? For a few minutes while he ran, he held some incalculable notion in his head about the difference between people like himself and people like Edgar, Ward Shaw, and even Grayson. To *matter*, it was necessary to do more than play it safe. To *matter*, one had to roll the hard six and accept what may come.

But he also realized he couldn't do that. The consequences for those people had been as great as their impact had been. Edgar had never told him outright, but Neil had sensed something deeper behind the other man's pain that day at the church. Edgar had somehow felt responsible for cutting Wecelo's life short; it simply wasn't true, so there had to have been something more in his past, some comparison or previous similar loss for which he had also blamed himself. More than that, Ward Shaw had nobody, Grayson had nobody, and Edgar had been trying to take on the world alone. With Kumari back in the truck and Rani ahead, Neil knew he simply did not have the option to make the risky choices these others had taken. It was both a relief and a disappointment to know that he himself would never matter in the grand scheme of things. There were billions of men scattered all over the worlds doing the same as hejust trying to survive and protect their families.

But what, then, had motivated the Englishman down the path behind him? That family had risked themselves for a stranger's sake.

His heart leapt as he saw the opposite wall of the valley ahead among the trees. He was more than halfway there, and the path had become more clay, dirt, and rock than wood, freeing him to jog faster. He was thankful for that, too, for his old bodybefore the lean months and endless walkingwould have failed him ten minutes in. Was he close enough now? He lifted his radio. "Hello, is anyone at the Waystation receiving?"

He listened, but that strange squealing static was his only replyuntil a half-obscured voice tried to cut through.

But it was just Showman. "Neil,  up  hind    hurry." A shout of pain preceded the sound of a slamming truck door.

"What's wrong?" He looked back as thunder answered his question, and he saw that the roiling clouds had grown ominously dark. Trace haze he recognized as signs of rain were even now sweeping in over the high ridges where little dark dots scrambled desperately for cover in clefts, caves, and crevices.

"Neil," Showman said again. " run or ver."

"What is it? I don't understand!"

The static cleared up for one blessed moment. "*Acid rain!*"

For a rare moment, his thoughts went quiet. It wasn't shock, and it wasn't fear. It was loss. There was something very obvious about what was needed, but he didn't want to do it. He was *so close*, Rani was *so close*to head back now and help that Englishman's family was the right thing to do in some objective and wide sense, but

"I can't  ell you  to do," Showman radioed, his grim and pained tone filling in what his words could not. "But    loyty to Kuari, Rani. Maybe that family   survive."

Neil looked down at his belt. What was leftmaybe twenty minutes of charge? It would be just enough to get him to the Waystation ahead, but running back to that family would take ten or twenty minutes all on its own, and then they would be half an hour from safety at the very least. Logistically, there was no way to help them.

He gripped his face as a stray drop of moisture seared fire into his cheek. Aghast, he realized consciously what he'd automatically assumed: anything out here, even the rain, was far more dangerous than it had any right to be. The strength of this acid would literally kill and melt away anyone caught in it. Again his thoughts returned to one of his previous questions: what would happen to the dead if they were completely destroyed? If there was no body at all to return to

His engineer instincts kicked in, and he looked to a large leaf to his left as the rain slid down its verdant curve.

Maybe people like Edgar risked everything because there was more to life than just survival. Generations coexisted for a reason, and the species would go on despite any one loss. Could he really live with himself and be the father he wanted to be if he left good people to die? More than that, he had to set an example for his daughter. Whatever he decided, she would know. The thought of her becoming disappointed in him was too much to bear; he was already running back before he had a chance to come to terms with his choice.

More than ever before, drumbeats accompanied his hammering heart and adrenaline-fueled run. This was not some species-wide crisis or global catastrophe. This was just him and that family against a single danger, and that meant there was actually something to be done. He was tired of being completely powerless and at the mercy of forces beyond his control.

The sky darkened in a wide black shoeprint against the clouds just over the valley as if evil was reaching down to stomp specifically him; he shrugged off the pain of stray acid drops and pushed on. A wall of grey haze approached above the trees, and he slammed into the Englishman and turned on his belt just as the pour lashed down with true intensity.

The distraught family peered up from under their high-held barriers of clothing and watched the blurry acid pouring down around the outside of the sphere of light.

The wide-eyed father gripped both his shoulders. "Thank God for you man!"

His wife recovered faster than he did. "Is time short? Should we run?"

Neil shook his head and tried to speak calmly for fear of upsetting the three kids. "Twenty minutes left on this shield. We'll never make it."

"Back the other way, then?"

The Englishman grimaced. "We're dead center. Half an hour ahead, half an hour behind." He gazed down between felled logs at pooling froth. "And at the bottom of a goddamn bowl of clay."

"It's alright," Neil said. "The trees!"

"What about 'em?"

"They're not burning." He gazed up through the curving white-lit liquid. "The acid rain must be native to this Earthand that means the trees are, too. They're immune to the acid!"

"What are we gonna do, build a shelter in twenty minutes?"

Neil laughed brightly and gripped the other man's shoulders right back. For once, he felt like he was exactly where he needed to be. "*I'm an engineer!*"

The ten-foot-wide sphere became a buzzing hive of activity as the six determined human beings moved into the ancient woods together and began picking up sticks, branches, and shattered pieces of trunks with as much speed as possible. No longer frightened, the teen boy and his two little sisters whipped out their survival knives and began whittling as Neil directed while their mother and father helped him assemble a flat lattice that would soon hold tied leaves.

"It doesn't have to be perfect!" Neil shouted over the roaring and surging rain. "It just has to sluice the water away from us!"

The Intelligent Barrier not only kept the falling rain off of them, but moved existing acid off of the wood, leaves, and ground as they moved in search of further materials. The children's tension began to subtly rise as bubbling water began to pool around the uneven bottom edges of the sphere; first just an inch, then a few, and then knee-high. Their father had been right about the shape and lay of the valley, and the two younger girls screamed as a wall of brackish water surged in and brought the sea of acid up to neck height.

"We're going to have to find something to climb on!" Neil yelled, but visibility through the surrounding dirty froth and the lashing rain above had become nearly nonexistent.

The Englishman put on a show of confidence for his family. "Then we just keep moving. We'll find it."

Together, they carried the wood-and-leaves lattice and walked along the bottom of a sea of acid. As the deadly waters bubbled over top and sealed away the last of the air above, Neil thought he heard music; distant notes of sorrow and loss haunted his hearing, but it was just an unprompted memory from his own father's funeralnot his mother's well-intentioned current husband, but the man he barely remembered from his childhood. It hadn't been his father's fault, but, nevertheless, he hadn't been there. Something about the vastness of space and the resonant loneliness of humanity in the universe had, as a result, always felt very personal.

He climbed along with his companion family, not really seeing, not really hearing. It was all swirling acid out there now, dark except for the underwater forest lit only by the sphere's glow, and yet their hands and feet found dry purchase on clay and wood. It was an eerie feeling, being exempt from an ocean like that, and he couldn't help but feel they'd left the real world behind and somehow climbed right into the afterlife itself. This was death, then: scrambling about with utter heart-crushing tension trying to survive in one's last momentsforever.

His neck strained with terror and a fake smile for the sake of his children, the Englishman murmured quietly, "How long?"

"Two minutes," Neil whispered back as he lifted one of the girls over the next log. "Maybe three."

"Do you pray?"

Neil could only look at him with despair.

"Because now would be the time."

It hadn't been prayer exactly, but existence *had* given him a break at times when he'd needed it most, when he'd cried out to that limitless emptiness for a permutation of events that allowed him and his baby daughter to survive. It was a small thing to ask; a pittance, really, in the face of all that was and all that there would be. What did it matter if one nobody and his kid got to live for one more day? The music of the universe was so incredibly eternal and boundless and complex, what did it matter if one tiny string of notes went on a bit too long? That dirge was playing now, in his head, from that organ at that church on that day. Too young, too soon, too unfair. He didn't understand, and he never would. He was a child then, facing death, and he would always be a child against the unknowable scope of the universe, of existence, of death. All he knew, all he begged for, was that the Great Unknown might spare Kumari that feeling of loss this one time. She deserved to have a father in her life. It *mattered.*

The wall of rock entered their sphere abruptly and silently. There was no fanfare save for the amazed and hopeful uptick of the song in his ears.

The Englishman shouted, "*Climb!*", and his family wasted no time. There was just enough space in the sphere to climb all together and lift the lattice; handhold by handhold and foothold by foothold, they pushed the top of the sphere out into the rain again and left the sea of acid behind in favor of a seat atop the large boulder that some glacier had deposited there just for them a hundred thousand years before.

The song was too loud now, blotting out his hearing, and Neil shook his head as the Englishman broke and began tearfully saying something to his kids. He reached up from below and touched each of their hanging legs, and then called out something to his wife. Confused, Neil looked around at the crying children and their despairing motherthere was no space for a sixth person on the portion of the boulder that jutted up from the water. The sphere of light flickered off, and the roaring music in his head went silent.

He sat with his back pressed against the woman and her children as they held the lattice overhead against the wind and sobbed. The sea of acid surged against their boulder and even lapped at their feet, but had no effect on their shoes. The rain ebbed and intensified at random, but the woman had placed the leaves with the skill of a seamstress, and not a single drop leaked through.

Something solid but light touched down above and slid away. Huddled on their rock, they watched through intermittent flashes of lightning as scattered silver strands began silently sliding down from unseen heights. This new forest grew thicker even as it movedtoward where they themselves had been headed. Thousands of silver strands brushed through the trees, into the acid, and even against and around their makeshift shelter as something massive soared overhead. It had been the dark footprint, Neil realizedsomething *up there,* something big enough to force the moisture and rain down around itself as it traveled the skies. It seemed the nightmare would never stop, never relent, save for the small consolation that the prototype barrier would have failed and let in the acid in a big fatal splashing clap had one of those silver strands come down earlier and presented a second simultaneous threat.

And however big the huddled and terrified five thought the creature in the skies might be, their fears were off by an order of magnitude. They sat and clung to one another under that paltry wooden construct as the thing in the skies sailed by for ten minutes twenty an hour two hours and then a third. The rising acid waters had slowed in ascent as each greater inch required more and more water to fill each successive layer of the valley, but more and more water was indeed coming down. There was nothing left to do. There were no options, and no choices.

How curious, Neil thought. He'd once huddled with other families in a tree and held Kumari for dear life while the grey waters of compressed space had flooded the world on the last day of the Crushing Fist. He hadn't been scared then, because all that was left, after all the choices and plays and strategies, had been faith. He'd asked the other families what was left to fear, and, indeed, there'd been nothing. Now Kumari was in a truck on high ground, and for that he was thankful, but he was still huddled with another family above the waters of death with nothing left to do but hope.

No one had spoken since the Englishman had fallen into the brown froth and vanished. Now, he said calmly, "It'll pass." They just kept huddling in silent fear, but he knew they'd heard him, and they shivered a little less fearfully.

At times, he clicked on his radio, but received nothing but keening static.

The darkness in the skies finally drew away in a turbulent line of orange evening light. The patter of the rain stopped, and the clouds began to dissipate. There was no music in his head at this, no stir in the wind, and no relieved chatter from the stunned family. Wordlessly, the five sat atop their rock and waited for the waters to recede. Neil took turns with their mother holding the kids in place so they could sleep; he could not doze off himself due to technically being dead.

The night was quiet, and the air completely open to the stars. A low and stark white blankness near the horizon marked that coming wall that many said would destroy this place in a year or two; he studied it for some time as it ever so slowly crept upwards, but there was nothing to see. It was just another astronomical phenomenon.

The only one awake, he sat alone and regarded the remaining dome of the sky. With no civilization on this planet, there was no light pollution, and he could see galaxies and nebulae clearer than ever before. *Existence* was out there, floating, orbiting, gravitating, and it would do so with or without him. The music of that celestial dance returned in full force, drowning out his thoughts, hopes, and fears. He could only stare upwards as his soul filled with unidentifiable awe and a sense of scale in which he himself simply didn't figure. When he could no longer stand it, he asked, "You don't care about us at all, do you?"

Silence reigned.

With one arm providing a brace for the sleeping family, he lifted his radio high with the other and let the random tones of an empty universe buzz and flicker. "It's true. You don't care about us."

He gazed without blinking and listened without thinking. Tremendous anticipation rose in his chest, as if some actual reply might be forthcoming after all these thousands of years that human beings had looked up at the sky and begged for answersbut the airy vibrations of atmosphere and space gave no hint of a reply.

He blinked, but the distortion remained. The haze of the Milky Way was still there, but something very subtle seemed to bend the light in a way that he would have never noticed except under those prime conditions and while staring at that exact spot he had chosen completely at random. It seemed to move ever so slowly, and in tune with the long and fading spectral tones of the song at the back of his mind. He narrowed his eyes. Was this the reply? In this solitary and private moment alone with the universe, was something trying to tell him that everything was going to be alright? It *was* possible. Why *couldn't* he have everything he wanted? His chin quivered as he thought about the prospect of surviving *and* seeing Kumari again *and* finally finding Rani.

"Neil, are you there Neil? Please come in"

"Showman!?" he shouted, immediately bringing his radio back down to his mouth. "Is Kumari alright?"

"She is. The acid doesn't eat metal or glass. The truck is fine, although our food supplies are done for."

"We'll figure something out." He laughed so hard that the emotion turned into a sob as haunting grey peeked over the high ridges to the east.

Against him, the family stirred, and they began to climb down after seeing that the waters had gone. The ground was still wet, and their mother warned the children not to touch it even as she went about carefully lifting etched bones from the skeleton in the mud below into a leather bag. "He'll be back," she murmured. "Eventually."

There might have been much to ruminate on at any other time, like how the inability to die had brought hope as well as pain, but Neil had no space left for thought. Tired, drained, and empty of will, he slogged across and down the muddy gulch with the family he had come back to help. All in all, if he had just taken the same road as the other refugees, he would have gotten to the Waystation sooner and without risking himself or anyone else.

" no way  could have known," Showman told him, breaking up more as the inexplicable static returned with the morning light. "   ari   get Rani."

"I will." He clicked the radio to his now-useless belt of wires and coils and walked in silence the rest of the way.

The random devastation in the forest reached a delta at the base of the opposite end of the valley. Climbing the damaged sloping rock with an ominous sense of foreboding, Neil led the small group up over the crest and stopped.

The piled rocks had been intended to form makeshift walls, yes, but they had not been made to defend the exit from Her Glory's region. The rock walls guarded a space off to the right side. Dead ahead, for a very long tract, the rock lay brutally damaged by a hundred different methods. Above that, the rift to the next world was a searing wound on space itself stretching for distances untold to the left, to the right, and straight up. He could immediately see that the strange beast of silver strands from the night before had forced its way through, but he could also tell that it had not been the first nightmare to pass this way. It was a very different kind of exodushumanity was not the only life fleeing widespread disaster, and this was the chokepoint of escape for countless different evils, powers, and threats.

He was shouting and running, then, toward those rock walls to the right. There was probably a more respectable way to do it, but he was done holding back. "Rani!"

Burly men greeted him with firm grips at the entrance, but he just kept shouting, "Rani Yadav! Is she here? Do you keep track of who comes through?! Rani Yadav!"

And then she was there before him, *that face!*, and *that voice!*but looking at him with surprised curiosity. "Do I know you?"

He fell to his knees on the sun-dried rock. "What Earth are you from?"

"Earth 42," she replied. "What about you?"

Too exhausted to keep from falling fully to the hard ground and crying, he failed to reply. It didn't matter anyway. Against all insane odds, he'd actually made it and found herbut she was the wrong Rani Yadav. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Phantom Possession Syndrome </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-20 23:58:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> People misunderstand how possessions happen. Decades of Hollywood misrepresentation, separation from old traditions, and a culture of silent suffering keep these things out of the public consciousness and make us vulnerable. When it began happening to me, I had no idea what I was dealing with. That ignorance let *it* fester and grow.

I am actually certain of the exact moment of contamination. I was on an archaeological dig in Montana with two dozen other students, and we were unearthing ancient out-of-place fossils and artifacts that multiple years of melt-back had freed from receding glaciers. There was a rather huge range of relics to be discovered, including never-before-seen religious sundries used by cavemen and dated some ninety thousand years before humans were supposed to have come to North America. While Eurasian Neanderthals had just been starting to bury their dead, these surprisingly modern bones had belonged to people with complex worshipping practices. It was all disconcerting enough that our professors, who had chosen this site more or less at random, had so far chosen not to go public with the discovery. There was every chance we were mistaken, the data was flawed, or something extraordinary had happened to transport these things here. It would take time to piece together an accurate picture.

That particular day, that particular hour, a fellow student named Greer had yet again bullied me into taking his shift. I was already tired from digging all morning, but he was built far more like these sturdy cavemen than I was, and I didn't feel like taking another secret punch in the gut. As a result, I was the one dusting away the dirt from an oddly spiked kneecap when a cold gust of wind knocked me forward and caused me to slice my pinky finger.

It was nothing, really; a scrape. The kneecap's protrusion was still sharp even after ninety thousand years, and I rubbed my finger against my jacket to dispel the itch the scrape had brought with it. I couldn't have known at the time that this malformed skeleton was surrounded by the heaviest concentration of religious relics, but I'm not sure what I would have done even if I had known.

The itching continued to nag at my awareness for the next several hours, enough that I sought out some basic medical supplies when I got back to my tent. Disinfectant seemed to make it go away, and I finally lay exhausted on my sleeping bag and hoped to do nothing but sleep for the next twelve hours. Unfortunately, that was when Greer invaded my tent and insisted I join him for drinking with some of the female students. We were not friends; it was all part of his carrot-and-stick routine for controlling people. Threaten quietly, reward publicly, and never let them relax.

I, of course, felt trapped. His rewards were well chosen. He seemed to saunter effortlessly among the circles of girls that usually so icily shut me out, and I was welcome and even adored as long as I was riding his coattails. There was no way for me to turn down the opportunity, and taking him up on it just put me further under the effects of his later bullying.

But that night I felt odd. With some alcohol in me, I began to feel that itch returning. No matter how much I scratched at my hand, I never seemed to hit the right spot. It was as if the growing burn was a millimeter or two above my skin, and maddeningly unreachable for lack of actual contact.

I excused myself a few hours in to go deal with the infuriating annoyance more thoroughly, but Greer caught up and stopped me. He was a head and a half taller than me, and he knew it. Usually, I backed down, but that night I was filled with fiery energy. A push sent him staggering back, and he just stared at me as I stalked away toward my tent.

Once alone, I scratched my pinky finger until it started to bleedand then I took out a knife, only stopping when I realized that I would just deal myself horrible damage. No, I needed another strategy. If the itch was a millimeter above my skin, maybe I could do the opposite of cutting myself. Carefully squeezing the skin, I managed to bunch it up a millimeter higher, and then rubbed my contorted hands against the rough fabric of my work jeans.

Ah, god, that was heaven. I can't even describe how great that first relief felt. The most apt saying would be that it was like scratching a long-denied itch, but that was actually exactly what it was. In any case, I lay on my sleeping bag, sighed happily, and slept wonderfully.

My dream that night was simple enough. I was walking across snow somewhere, but I wasn't cold.

I awoke to about five seconds of continued happinessand then the itch set in again.

Staring at my hand in confusion, I realized that the itch was now undeniably *outside my hand.* I could rotate it and feel the position change, always maintaining itself about an inch to the right of my pinky finger. How could I have an itch outside my body?! Agonized and overwhelmed by a tide of anxious energy brought on by the return of the itch, I began considering rather terrible alternatives.

The first was, of course, to try to ignore it. The burning continued outside my hand, and even outside my glove, as I tried to participate in the dig. I was back at the same malformed body that day, and the itch intensified greatly whenever I went too near. I did my best to focus all my energy on resisting the annoying pain, but digging out bones is delicate work, and I knew I would just damage something if I continued. I pretended I was sick and headed back to my tent.

Greer found me out of sight of the others and left me with a bruised arm and abdomen. Bastard. It was his way: cold, calculated, and private punishment for crossing him. I didn't have spare energy to resist, and I walked off the added pain. In fact, the hurt helped me do what needed to be done once I was safely alone in my tent. I'd already found the basic solution the night before. Now I just needed to get my skin an inch out from my pinky. God. Wincing, I carefully pulled out my knife again, sanitized my finger with rubbing alcohol, and then went to work.

I aimed to do as little damage as possible. Cutting a tiny flap of skin, I lifted it, but didn't reach my goal. Steeling myself, I cut a little bit further, and then lifted a little bit higher.

Still not enough.

With tears running down my burning cheeks, I cut all the way to my nailand then lifted the flap of skin away from the muscle.

I sighed with euphoria as the scratching finally made contact.

It was over.

Ah, god, it was over.

Scratching to my heart's content before closing the skin again and using bio-glue to seal the cuts, I wrapped up my pinky and fell to sleep. I dreamed again of walking across vast glaciers under an open primordial sky. This time, evening fell, and I sighted something unexpected on a distant mountain: light.

I awoke and lay quietly for a time. Cutting myself had been crazy, but that was all over, and I was just glad nobody else had seen me behaving strangely.

My relief faded as a familiar burning sensation sparked up again. This time, it was a wide strip of itching nearly a foot outside my right arm. I slammed my fists into the hard ground underneath the fabric of my tent, collapsed, and even cried a little, but I knew that there was not going to be an easy way out of this like I'd thought. I couldn'tno!twelve inches out, the amount of cutting would be unthinkableI would have to

I was thinking, I was thinking, I just had to apply some knowledge. I got out my phone and did some searches on the internetproprioception. That was what it was called, the human body's sense of where its own limbs are. It was different from the vestibular system, I read, narrowing down what I needed to know. Alright, malfunctions in the proprioception system. What could I find?

Phantom limb syndrome.

Sitting frozen for a time as the itching tingled quietly, I knew I'd hit upon the problem. I hadn't had a limb amputated, but I knew this was still it. I was experiencing phantom limb pain for a limb I had never had.

Rushing to the dig site, I pretended all was well and went back to work. On fire in more ways than one, I ignored the itching and uncovered as much of the strange skeleton as I could. My suspicions were vindicated when I began revealing, from the ancient rock, a third arm. The bones were different in shape and structure, and likely would have been categorized as being from a different skeleton, but I knew better. Whatever this thing was, it had had more than two arms.

My understanding of the situation still contained numerous missing pieces, including the mechanism of how I had contracted this *thing's* proprioceptive sense of self, but I had some idea what I was dealing with now. It's easy to say it's time go to the doctor, but it's another thing to actually do it. I'd lived my entire life avoiding the police and avoiding the doctor simply because that's what you do in America; I couldn't even envision myself going to them with the fragments I had found. I would be locked up in a heartbeat, or given a bankrupting medical bill with no real treatment. No, I had to deal with this on my own.

But the limbs gave me an idea. Covering my work with a tarp early and heading off, I evaded the other students and headed on foot to the nearby town with my archaeological tools. It was a small place, mainly populated to serve the National Park, but it did have a graveyard.

About here is where, objectively, I see my decision-making was a bit compromised. The only thing I can offer in my defense is this: imagine an itch the length of your arm, but outside your body, burning away horribly in a place you can't even scratch. Imagine that going on for an entire day, worsening with each passing moment; the boiling anger and frustration literally cooks the brain, goading it to desperate action. I can tell you, too, though it is no real excuse, that my actions were not entirely my own.

I found the most recent grave and began digging.

The arm was actually fairly intact. After smuggling it back to my tent, I cut away bits of the bone near its shoulder as needed and began stitching both it and myself. Once it was truly part of me, I scratched myself right into a drug-like high. The leathery skin of the corpse-arm came away in many places, as rotting flesh tends to do, but I could *feel it.* I could *feel* the itch being satisfied. So, so, so, so happy, I lay back, relaxed, and slipped into that dream again.

After treading across a long valley and climbing a steep icy slope, I came upon a cave, wherein dozens of very lost and dirty mammals sat huddled around a fire.

The morning light streaming through the fabric of my tent blended with the image of that fire and woke me in a slow transition. I reached up to block the brightnessand stared. My hand was not my hand. 

No, my hand was still there. This was a new one.

Yeah, I panicked a little bit then. Somehow, during the night, the arm that I had dug up from a grave and stitched onto myself had become truly attached to me. I could feel through its leathery fingers, move it at will, and even lift things. I had a third arm. What the hell?

Even as I stared, the itching began againthis time outside my left arm.

That was the morning that I realized just how deeply in trouble I was. This was no accident, no random brain malfunction, and no allergic reaction. Something was inside me and doing this to me. For God's sake, I'd gone to a graveyard and dug up an arm! Where had that idea come from? *And how had it become a functioning part of me?*

I felt stronger, too. My gear felt lighter, and I felt a tension in my muscles that almost demanded I find a way to employ my strength. As I carefully bound one of my arms under my bulky winter jacket so that nobody would notice it, I almost hoped Greer would try something today. I was hungry for conflict, and rather excited at the prospect of violence. He was weak, and I would show him who was in charge.

But he and some blonde girl had skipped out that day. Our particular professor was annoyed, but he always let Greer get away with things like that. I could see now that the professor was also, somehow, under Greer's thumb. Pathetic.

Piece by piece, I secretly carried the malformed skeleton away and set it up in my tent exactly as it had been in the ground, surrounding religious artifacts and all. What had at first appeared to have been an honored burial now looked to me like an attempted exorcism. Somebody had invented this particular ritual about ninety thousand years early, which meant there had likely been a very dire need.

And the space above my left arm burned with awareness-numbing agony.

No. I couldn't. I wouldn't. I had to stop myself.

But there was another voice inside, whispering about possibilities, screaming about relief. It was as if the voice came from the skeleton laid out before me, but also from inside my head. The ancient bones contained a fourth arm that was different from both the original two and the third.

I staggered into the chill woods, intent on fighting the foreign urges with all my strength. It was better if I was delirious and lost, for then I could never find my way to the graveyard.

And yet, somehow, I did.

This new arm attached to me almost immediately.

Covered in dirt and rotting gore and sweat, I found my way to the town church. Long-ago men had found a way to deal with this threat, and descendant traditions still existed. The priest within did not believe my rantings and almost called the policeuntil I showed him my four arms, and the spiked bone beginning to pierce the skin above my kneecaps and elbows.

The foreign entity inside me shed its sly tactics the moment I let myself be chained up. I could hear its voice in my head; angry, violent, and arrogant. Where had it come from? What did it want? The terrified priest surely didn't know, and he did his best to ignore my rants and pleas until a cadre of other priests arrived. They, too, stared at my four arms. They, too, crossed their chests.

Tied up in a blank-walled stone room underneath the church and surrounded by candles and sigils, I found myself evaluating the men for traits I could take from them. Many were older, but one priest was younger and had good muscle tone. I could take that tissue, cut my skin open, and push it inside. It would become mine. I was as humans had always been meant to be: editable. It was obvious once little things like squeamishness, disgust, and respect for life were brushed aside. We were modular. Why else would all our parts be so uniform?

Even as the priests threw water on me for some reason, I grinned. Humans knew it, too! They took livers and lungs and kidneys and even hearts from the dead and put them into the living. What was so wrong with what I was doing, then? We were all on the same page! The strong deserved to take the weak's best pieces and thus become stronger themselves. That was the way of nature. Why, then, did these people resist?

And they'd asked for this. They'd cried out against their own biomechanical failure and eventual mortality. They'd cried out for salvation. They'd prayedand they'd been heard. Did they reject what they had asked for simply because their arrogant idea of God looked so much like themselves? They mistakenly believed me to be a demon, but if they thought I was their worst nightmare, then I couldn't imagine how they would react if they ever met a real one

And then it was gone, burning away like so much smoke from my every pore.

I was covered in holy water and strange fluids, and two of the priests were down with minor injuries. The rest were cutting at the stitches holding my two new arms; they fell away, useless. The spiked bone at my knees and elbows was receding, too.

I shouldn't have been surprised that I'd been unaware of most of the exorcism. The entity had been fighting for control then, even as it had tried to convince me to support it. Had it just been lying? It couldn't really have been one of the *good guys*, could it? I shuddered at the thought that the horrifying world of organic osmosis it had shown me might be the Heaven that awaited us after death.

You'd be surprised how little bonding there is after an exorcism. It felt a bit like a visit to the DMV. The priests made sure I was alrightand that I was myselfand then, well, I was let loose back on the street. What else could they do? It wasn't like we were going to be friends now. Some of them had literally gone white-haired from the shock of whatever they had witnessed, and they refused to discuss it or even look at me.

That was it. That was my possession from beginning to end. I still have the skeleton, although any lingering demonic spirit it contained is now gone. The only traces of the entity left are in meideas, attitudes, perhaps a bit of unspoken philosophy.

Why speak out? Why tell my tale? Well, it's obvious. We've got a lot to learn. The lessons begin now.

I don't consider what I've done bad or disgusting. When they took Greer out of his tent bleeding, crying, and screaming, I could only feel the predatory triumph of the strong.

The students and professors were outwardly horrified, sure, but I could tell they were appreciative that someone had done something to free them all from their false god. Appearances were important to this culture. That I knew. Therefore, what I took from him would be unseen by most, and yet it had been the source of his strength and would now be the source of mine. I gazed around the circle of onlookers until I found the blonde girl he'd dallied with the day before. In a way, I could now see her the way he had seen her, in all her willingness and beauty. She was a good choice. She made eye contact with me and blushed, but did not look away.

I grinned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So I have just started to get into your stories and was wandering if I was looking to start reading possibly purchase some of your work off amazon where would be a good starting point?

Here's a great [fan-made wiki](http://forest.wolfnexus.net/wiki/index.php/Multiverse_unofficial_reading_guide) with a suggested reading list.

In terms of [my Amazon books](http://www.amazon.com/Matt-Dymerski/e/B00A82LSW4), the older ones are horror compilations of stories I wrote from places like CreepyPasta and NoSleep. [The Portal in the Forest](http://www.amazon.com/Portal-Forest-Matt-Dymerski-ebook/dp/B00S0DQK1M/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) is where my horror/scifi fusion series begins. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Thanks for everything you're doing Matt, you're a bloody legend :)

Thanks a ton :) that's the best I can hope for!

 Due to the huge amount of writing already comprising the multiverse, and the nature of things from many stories back relating to more recent stories, I just wanted to know exactly how much planning (time wise) has gone into writing this universe, whether or not everything that's happening now was planned by you from the beginning, and if so, how far into the story does the planning extend? Have you planned the story of this universe to its conclusion, or will you eventually have to leave the beaten trail?

Hmm, there's some discussion of a giant timeline I have in my basement elsewhere in this AMA, but I would say every 1000 words you have read has taken one hour to write, but five hours to plan. I have a massive framework for what's happening, but I often hammer out the details once I get there and see how the actual flow of the story goes.

Some planned scenes sound cool in my head, but then I get there and the characters have something else in mind (or they think of a shorter or more efficient route to their goals). [there might be some spoilers here if you're not caught up to Humanity Revived Part 6] - Edgar Brace is notable for this because he's got a gamer's mentality, and as a result he's avoided at least ten different dangerous pitfalls that were, with no specific targets, intended to hurt or kill people around him. I actually hoped to go much darker with Humanity Revived, but he's kept Neil, Mashburn, and Cantey from fates worse than death on multiple occasions because (and I quote myself sighing when I say this aloud) "Edgar would never fall for that..." or "Edgar would never make that mistake...". He's very strong on the tactical side, but much weaker on the strategic and emotional side, so we keep avoiding or overcoming individual threats while the bigger picture suffers... and we're already seeing hints of that problem coming home to roost.

Right now I think we're nearly halfway through this stage of the writing plan for the major arc of what's happening to this human race. The first 'part' was the first six series from Portal in the Forest to Our Final Acts, and the second 'part' began with New Exodus Vanguard, so Humanity Revived is series 2 of 6 in similar fashion, after which I plan for another six series (which is not to say any given conflict won't be resolved sooner than any of these natural endpoints). The greater goal is to show the tremendous arc of the story in broad fashion through the eyes of the people who lived the core of it, and in so doing create a fertile ground for lots of future stories set at different time periods inside it. I mean we've already come to know the general layout of multiple different political regions in this area of the multiverse, along with about a thousand years of general history, so there's a ton to be explored there already. I really liked anthology series books growing up, and my favorites were compilations of shorter stories within the greater universe of the series. There would be tales about 'back in the day' or '800 years ago' or even alternate timelines, and it all rang much more emotionally resonant because the rest of the universe was so fleshed out. I'd definitely like to go down that route for awhile. The most poignant, memorable, or heart-breaking short stories to me were ones that built on the hundreds of hours the reader had invested in a world already and so could skip all that for the sake of flow and focus. Gisela's and Wecelo's stories feel that way to me, and are two of my favorite chapters to have written. I'm super excited to get to plaaces like that where I get to look back at the past, because obviously I couldn't start Chapter 1 Portal in the Forest with "It all began in 989 AD, but Cristina Thompson didn't know this when she sat down on that stoop!!"

[I'll say this vague enough to avoid spoilers] And we're still barreling toward collision with something else unexpected story-wise. Edgar keeps unknowingly avoiding it (:P) and as such has bought the characters quite a bit of time already, but you guys will know it when it happens. That will likely be the space for future stories that 'continue' the tale of this humanity. That will be leaving the beaten trail when it occurs. I'm actually worried about the characters down that unknown path, because it won't be pretty. For the moment, we're obviously following certain characters for a reason, so purely because of writing conventions it's unlikely they'll die, but that 'other thing' brings with it a much darker tone and a shift in narrative voice that strips away plot armor. From an author's point of view... that's actually pretty scary, right here and now as I type this. I wish that I could whisper to them: *don't go there!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the passenger seat, Edgar said, Just keep driving. Steady and constant.

To his credit, the older man kept his foot on the gas even as the others balked. Practically cowering against the back of the cab, Neil covered his daughter and jumped his gaze from web to web. The massive ethereal nets hung high and silent between the trees, veritable sails against the icy night breeze. The book had told them these spiders had specialized senses to detect the sudden acceleration of insects, birds, and the like, so he knew that a steady speed would probably let them drive under the radar, but seeing an apparently snow-covered forest turn out to be the home for millions of spiders instead had shaken him in a primal way.

These Earths suck, Cantey murmured.

Showman nodded emphatically, but said nothing.

Grayson eyed the endless white canopy overhead and kept his hand on his gun.

All Neil could think about was that poor undying person up in the sea of webs somewhere whose soul they had spoken to through the book. Edgar had stopped reading after the fourth successive day the spider had returned to inject paralyzing poison and feed on his silk-bound flesh. The worst was the trapped boys realization that his body was very slowly regenerating just enough to be fed on dailyforever.

Did the same hold true for the other unfortunate dead? Hed personally seen a veritable ocean of frozen bodies above the Zkirax tunnels, and then been driven through them as they warmed back to life and began moving and begging for help en masse. His inner engineer simply could not make heads or tails of it. Did that regeneration mean there was some tremendous force out there pouring energy and mass into the dead? How did said force identify what was corpse and what was not? How did it know what any given persons body was supposed to look like? What happened if a person was completely disintegrated? How did a dead person move around or use their senses without a completely functional nervous system? The questions were endless, and he focused on those mysteries to keep himself from panicking as the truck began pushing through thickening webs directly.

But one thought gave him an ominous chill that defied even the blankets wrapped around him and his held daughter. There *was* an energy source, potentially, that knew what each individual body was supposed to look like: their soul. That strange book spoke to souls, which meant they were real, but what properties did they have? Were the souls of the dead draining away in order to restore their bodies? What would happen when

He breathed a collective sigh with the others as the forest abruptly ended and the truck shot out onto flat grassy plains once more.

Mashburn stepped on the gas hard to put some distance between them and the forestand a massive wall of glowing yellow dots in strange patterns lit up along the entire dark edge behind them. Ever so silently, the stars above the forest began blotting out. Neil stared until Showman shouted, Theyre jumping!

It was true. A wave of irregular dark shapes began soaring in a growing dome overhead on the ends of countless strands glinting starlight against the night.

Edgar took one look out his side window and shouted, Faster!

Through the rear window of the cab, Neil saw Mashburn lower his head slightly. The engine whined as the truck reached dangerous maximum acceleration.

Grayson kneeled on the bouncing bed of the truck and aimed his handgun up, but the move was pointless. He quickly turned and began opening one of the crates.

Not here! Edgar yelled back. We have to make those count!

They wont count at all if we die here! Grayson screamed at him.

Well make it, Edgar replied, leaning out the window and glaring. No way in hell those spiders evolved to jump faster and farther than a truck.

Grayson continued to work at the crates locks, but Cantey held his hands up, staying out of the conflict. In his place, Showman jumped forward across the dangerously uneven bed and knocked the lanky man over.

Neil slid away as best he could, unable to help. He watched as the darkness overhead sailed down rapidlyand barely fell short of the truck. Struck by something, Showman went down, and Grayson pushed him off.

Alongside Cantey, Neil watched as a silent sea of dark shapes retreated back toward the forest by launching into the air again along their now-invisible strands. Not quite believing how close theyd come to something horrible, it took him a moment to slide over and check his friend.

Showman groaned; the bladed end of a spiders leg had grazed his forehead. Not again!

This kind of thing happen often? Neil asked, laughing now that he knew everything was alright.

Kind of, yeah, the other man said as he sat up and leaned against the side of the truck while dabbing away stray blood. The multiverse is a rough place.

Yeah. He shuddered as he thought one last time of that trapped boy. The kids only hope was a blissful release through real death once this situation somehow got sorted. How had the world inverted so terribly, that death was now a longed-for solution?

Grayson grimaced. "Sorry, I panicked a little bit. I'm terrified of spiders."

"It's fine," Showman said, shrugging it off. "I had half a mind to do the same thing."

Cantey perked up, and Neil saw light ahead on the horizon.

In short order, they approached something incredibly unexpected: a farm. 

The ground underneath the wheels became noticeably smoother. Neil hadn't realized how much he'd hated the uneven bouncing of wild terrain until they hit the quiet calm of a flat dirt road. A fence made of tied wooden posts marked the outer perimeter, and a low wall of stacked flat stones marked another. At both occasions, Cantey and Showman leapt down and opened a wide wooden barrier on hingesthe headlights illuminated a sign which read, *Please close the gate behind you,* and so they did.

More signs emerged from the darkness ahead, directing them along three splits in a road that seemed to have been cleared of grass and rocks on purpose rather than simply by use; eventually, at Showman's quiet insistence, Mashburn rolled the vehicle to a temporary stop alongside an exhausted family of five. The parents carried everything they owned on their backs, but remained tired-cheerful for the sake of the kids, and Neil felt a twinge of pain of the type he tried desperately every day not to think about. "Hop in," Edgar said after a subtle glare at Showman.

"We have to act like we have nothing to hide or protect," Showman whispered into the open back window as the family began climbing on with relieved sighs and many thanks.

Neil guessed that his friend was just using that as an excuse, but it was a good thing to use an excuse for. "He's right."

Edgar nodded. "Good point."

Further signs ahead gave clear directions: *If you arrive at night, do not disturb the farmhouse. Campground C is for night arrivals. You must check in with the farmhouse first thing in the morning. If we see someone we don't know because you didn't bother to check in, we will ask you to leave. No excuses.*

"Just how many people are here?" Showman asked.

Neil shook his head and slowly rocked his daughter, who had fallen back to sleep easily now that they were traveling on smooth dirt road. "Look, tents."

"Whaddya know. It's like our second home a second time."

Indeed, the campfires and tents stretched as far as they could see under the veil of the night. There was something different about this place, though. Unlike the farm realities, this place was not full of revelry and partying undertaken by countless refugees who had nothing better to do with their time. There were people out there, certainly, but most were asleep and quiet.

"What are they doing for food?" Cantey asked.

The family riding with them wondered the same.

Reaching the end of the grounds, Mashburn pulled the truck to a stop, and the extended group went about the business of setting up camp. The family they'd given a ride took the spot a few feet over and set up their own tent. They were inside and asleep minutes later, children and all.

It was Neil's turn to sleep along the seats inside the truck, but he found himself slow to lay out his and Kumari's blankets. How insane was it that he was longing for those refugee campgrounds? How low had he fallen that *that* was now the barely reasonable dream? Deeper into the past, the house he and Rani had left behind seemed not even a shadow of a fantasy. Not only would he never see that house again, houses like that didn't even exist anymore. It was all tents and dirt and bathing in creeks now; a million riders like Edgar had given their lives to map the region and spring all the traps so that the refugees behind them could walk in moderate safety. Only a lucky few had survivedhe cut that thought short as he glanced over at Edgar, who lay staring up at the stars.

In truth, Edgar had not survived.

His thoughts dancing riotously with unknowable fears, Neil felt that he would never sleep, but he was startled awake nonetheless by a glinting poke in the eye from the newly risen sun shining through the grimy cab window. The air smelled foul; he sighed, and got up to change Kumari. It was time to find another creek and wash her makeshift diaper. This was the inglorious reality of carrying around a baby; he hoped that whoever was reading about them in the future would leave this part out.

It wouldn't do to simply wander around. He figured he could ask at the farmhouse during their mandatory check-in. Their neighboring family was already putting their children's shoes on, and he made small talk with the father until they were ready to go. The mother stayed behind to guard the tent, as did Mashburn and Cantey for the truck and its secret array of weapons and technology. Those three would have to go check in once the others returned.

More strict and domineering signs led them down a well-trampled dirt road, and Neil walked in near-constant amazement at the expanse of structures and tents that he could now see by morning light. A great many thousands of people had stopped here on the journey to the Waystation two or three days' walk further on, and someone had arranged the campgrounds, facilities, and farming-related areas with military precision.

"This one of the farms you said Shaw was sending people out to set up?" Neil asked.

Edgar's inner burden was lighter today. He smiled after reading another glowering sign and said, "Must be. Would have to have been one of the first to have gotten so much done."

The farmhouse slowly made itself known among the sprawl of recently constructed buildings. It had clearly once been small and unassuming, but now looked to have sprung a dozen new extensions. The heart of the heart of the farm was now just a tiny core of a much larger beast. The signs did not lead them to that private little corner. Instead, they entered a large and frenetic entrance room where a range of women sat talking, shouting, and typing on laptops.

Neil's engineer hands itched to touch technology again, and he noticed Edgar's eyes lingering on the laptops as well.

"Don't ogle the girls," Showman murmured with a grin.

Both men stammered an explanation, but he was already stepping forward to talk to a well-muscled man with long dark hair who lowered his kicked-up feet and placed his book down at their approach. "Welcome." He stood behind his desk and held out his hand. "I'm Cade. We like to meet every single newcomer in person. It's important to know what's going on around the farm."

"Oh, you own the place?" Showman asked.

"Me and the wife, yeah." Cade turned and shouted toward another room. "Honey, more new people."

"It's every day all day now!" came the replying female shout. "Hold on." A few moments later, a very pregnant woman with dark red hair waddled in through a set of swinging wooden doors. She came over to meet the children first, tussling their hair and making them smile with a series of silly questions, and then she came to Kumari. "Oh, this one needs changed." She began moving away, and then turned her head. "Come on then. Give my husband your name and follow me."

"Um, Neil Yadav. And this is Kumari, my daughter."

The women behind Cade began typing furiously. "Spell that?" one asked.

He spelled out their names and then hesitated. "There's someone I'd like to look for, if I could."

Cade nodded. "Of course. When you come back."

"Alright."

"Grayson," the next in line said.

"Is that your first name or last name?" one of the scribes asked.

Neil followed Casey through a wide cafeteria-like area populated by burly men eating thick soup. She stopped and clapped some of them on the shoulder to tell them they'd done a good job the day before. Continuing on, she told Neil, "Everyone here at Concord Farm works one day for each day they stay. Got it?"

He put on a sheepish smile. "Seems fair. I'm, uh, an engineer."

"Ooh, we could use you. Our last engineer went on to the Waystation three days ago, and I want somebody to take a look at the solar panels."

"Ah, the power for the laptops," he said automatically as something clicked in his thoughts.

"Yes. Among other things." She waddled through another set of doors and into a cozy room with big glassless windows that let in the breeze. A good thirty or forty children of various ages ran chaos through the room, and one harried teacher tried desperately to get his class under control. Casey coughed, "Ahem," and the kids instantly quieted, formed up ranks, and stood trembling. "Good. Now give Mister Hammond your best behavior today, alright?"

"Yes ma'am," they said in choir-like unison.

The teacher in question sat abruptly and slumped with relief.

Neil now understood who had written the demanding signs. Following the proprietor through two more hallways, he carried Kumari into a nursery that hosted about twenty much younger children.

"She'll be alright here while you work," Casey told him.

Only now understanding what she intended, Neil defensively held his daughter close. "I should probably stay with her."

The redhead laughed compassionately. "After the manky walks out there, most parents feel that way. But it'll be healthy for both you and Kumari to spend a little bit apart."

A thousand horrible things flashed through his head. "But what if"

"Now where did I imply you had a choice, Mister Yadav?" Casey said, putting her foot down both literally and figuratively. "You can't work effectively with a babe on your arm."

He gulped and fought a nervous strain, but handed Kumari over to the nursery-woman. His daughter waved a stubby arm at him, but did not cry or panic.

Casey smiled. "There you go. I'll show you to the solar panels."

Feeling strange without his daughter close, Neil looked back at her, but Kumari was giggling as the nursery-woman changed her. He also saw babies her age playing with toys and crawling around, and he realized that it would probably actually be good for her to interact with other kids. Steeling his heart, he followed the very pregnant redhead a little further. "Maybe you could just tell me where the solar panels are?"

She turned furiously, glared for a moment, and then turned forward again. No words had been needed.

They veered outside and along the side of the sprawling farmhouse-headquarters. With a moment to think, Neil wondered at how quickly the places human beings stopped became full of bureaucracy. The farm realities, Shaw's offices in the Zkirax tunnels, even this farmsteadwas it a fundamental flaw of humanity, or a secret strength? As he'd seen during his tenure heading up the farm systems, organizational efficiency meant saving lives. Were places like this the kernels of civilization's rebirth? Then humanity would win its new home on the backs of farmers and engineers, not soldiers. He blurted without thinking, "Is all this what you wanted when you came out here?"

Casey paused in place.

He gazed for a moment at the back of her head, where her dark red hair ran thickest.

A dozen rotting men rounded a corner in the low stone wall and approached. Forgetting himself, Neil stepped back in instinctive fright.

At that, Casey finally turned to face him. "If you haven't noticed, people can't die anymore. They make good workers, and they don't need food. Don't be an arse."

"Casey," the lead dead man gasped, holding his slashed throat to be heard better. "The irri'ation system for field A-6 is still muckin' up."

She sighed. "Change of plans. Mister Yadav, you've any experience with farm systems?"

He laughed nervously. "I managed a farming reality's systems during the Crushing Fist, actually."

She looked him up and down with veiled surprise. "Then you're right on time."

She waddled back into the building, and Neil found himself walking toward field A-6 with a dozen dead men. Awkward to awkward, he told himself with a grimace. "So"

"It sucks," a man with a gaping head wound said immediately. "Being dead sucks."

"*I* don't plan to be dead forever," another said. "Just takes time, is all."

Neil thought again of that poor boy trapped in the spider forest some distance away. "You're all regenerating?"

"Aye, slowly."

"That's crap," the first replied. "Even if we do heal up to full, there's still not enough food for but a bit of us. They need us to stay dead."

"You don't think they'd kill us again, do you?"

Neil tried not to look at their horrible injuries while the field grew nearer at too slow a pace.

"Who knows what people'll do."

Hoping desperately to change the subject, Neil asked, "Um, ah, what's the farm's plan for the coming cold?"

The lead man held his throat and grinned. "Snow wheat. Some 'irl found wheat that'll 'row in snow."

"And we can work in snow," the first complainer muttered. "We dead men, toiling away in the cold, growing snow wheat for the living."

A man at the back said gruffly, "Shut the hell up. I consider it an honor, and a rare opportunity to use my death for something amazing."

Neil slowed a bit, but the leader told him, "Don't worry. We have these same fights every day all day. Nothin' for dead men to do but complain and work. Not like we can blow off some steam with 'irls or nothin'." He gave a disgusting laugh which made blood ooze from his neck.

"I get that." Neil did his best to ignore their ongoing arguments. His thoughts at that moment remained almost entirely on the prospect of running back to that farmhouse and demanding to know if Rani's name was on those laptop lists, but his worries faded for a time as he engaged his brain in the activity of wandering around field A-6 testing the irrigation system. The vast rectangular field held an array of dead men and women waiting to do their jobs; they looked almost like a crop in and of themselves. The four-foot high stalks waved in the chilly wind, but it had not yet snowed here. He wondered how fast snow wheat grew, or, alternatively, how long ago this farm had been founded. It felt strange to think that, while he and his family had been first wandering the wastes, someone had had the foresight and fortitude to decide to start a farm way out here. The only person he knew with that kind of ambition was Rani.

He walked back that evening with a heavy feeling in his heart. Cade had his Casey, and, together, they had built all this. What could he and Rani have made if they'd only had the chance?

Under the orange evening light, and through rare warm breezes, he saw a figure running down the road waving its hands and shouting. He looked behind him, but he was the only one on that particular track at that particular moment. As the man drew closer, Neil recognized his worn clothes and gear.

"Neil!" Showman shouted from afar. "*Neil!*"

He began running toward his friend in turn, terrified. "What's wrong? Is it Kumari?!"

Showman dashed right up to him, took him by the forearm, and turned around to keep running right back. "Rani's in the computer!"

Laughing, exuberant, Neil raced alongside the bearer of amazing news. "What? When?"

"She was here!" Showman told him. "Rani Yadav, right there on the list. She left two days ago."

"Where'd she go?!" he practically shrieked.

"The same place everyone goes. The Waystation!" Showman slowed for a moment. Covered in sweat and visibly exhausted from the long run, he pushed on. "It's two or three days' walk, so she might almost be there." He panted between sentences. "We have to go *right now.* We have to catch up."

"Surely we can use the truck and overtake her?" Neil asked, not daring to slow his run until he heard all there was to hear.

Showman shook his head, throwing sweat in both directions. "It's the Waystation's exit," he forced out. "It's one-way. People't'go can't come back."

He didn't question it. He didn't ask why that was the case. There would be time for that later. Finding energy he didn't know he had, he ran ahead.

"Go!" Showman shouted after him. "Get the truck, I'll go to the main road."

"Get Kumari!" Neil yelled back.

Showman gave a grunt to indicate that he'd heard, and Neil turned down a direct road to campground C at a pace he knew he never could have managed in his old life. Months of walking and his recent better eating and Edgar's training had whipped him into the shape he'd never found at the gym Rani had made him attend. More than that, he finally had something greater to look forward to than simply surviving and protecting his daughter. If he did find Rani, if he could just find her, *please*, he would build something like this farm with her. He knew it. He promised.

Edgar seemed to have just returned from his own day of labor in the fields. Neil shouted from a distance, not caring what attention he drew from the nearby tents, and the men were ready for action by the time he came close enough to explain.

But Edgar was not as immediately supportive as he'd hoped. "We have a mission," he said quietly. "Important technology to distribute, and big things are happening. I don't know if we can spare the day to drive after her and the day to drive back."

Breathing hard, Neil glared. "What? Aren't we going to the Waystation anyway to get your people?"

"Yeah, but we have to meet someone here first."

"Seriously? Why are the details of this mission always hidden from us?"

"Are you a soldier?"

"No, but"

Grayson cut in from his perch on the end of the truck. "He's afraid his buddies won't believe he is who he says he is."

Edgar let out a long breath, and all of his negativity. "Holy shit, you're right. My decision-making's compromised on this issue."

Chuckling darkly, Grayson said, "I know a thing or two about not fitting in."

Mashburn and Cantey found a discreet distance at which to stand and listen.

"You wait here for your meeting," Neil said, pressing the issue. "Give me the truck. I'll be back before you know it. I have to leave *now*. The exit from the Waystation is one-way"

"Is that true?" Edgar asked. He turned to their neighboring family, who confirmed that they'd heard that as well. "Damnit." He thought for a moment, and then said, "What's the hurry, though? We'll all pass that way."

Neil narrowed his eyes even as sweat dripped in front of them. "You can't be serious."

"That was always the plan. Get the tools we need to survive and get the hell out of Dodge."

"Look around you," Neil said loudly. "The Zkirax tunnels, this farm and others out therethese people aren't building their lives again just to leave."

"But there's a war on, and" Edgar looked around, thinking of the secret Zkirax threat. "other dangers, besides."

"There's *always* a danger! But you know how we've survived *at all* out here?"

"You're gonna tell me, I bet."

"Yeah, I am. I get that you risked your life to ride out here and map the region and you feel like you failed, but you're wrong. *You succeeded.* Humanity at large gets to avoid the worst dangers because of you. The same won't hold true of whatever's out there beyond the Waystation. Here, there are Amber Worlds and Grey Riders and Zkirax and Her Glory, all of which help tame the multiverse by their presence. They might be threats at the moment, but they're *political* threats. They're not just going to eat us mindlessly like those spiders back in that forest. This is where we have to make our stand. This is our new home. We've already found it. You ask Casey back there if she intends to leave."

"What about the cold?" Edgar asked, his tone indicating that he was actually open and listening.

"They've got snow wheat that'll grow in the cold, and dead workers to tend the farm no matter the weather," Neil continued, high on his own determination. "They've figured it all out while we've been running around looking for weapons. And you know what? I think we might have made it far enough. We're at the ass end of Her Glory's entire domain. I felt a warm breeze not half an hour ago. It's not snowing here. It's not brutally cold. It's not *dying.* We thought one thing, we believed one thing; turns out the reality's a little betterfor oncethan we knew. Things *can* get better."

Edgar considered silently for a moment before saying, "I've had a tough time staying true to myself lately. Life out here is insane." He stood tall. "It's a tactical mistake to give you the truck and leave us stranded here with all this tech and no way to move it"

Neil started forward angrily.

"but I think I've been learning, from you, that life has to be a little bit more than tactical."

He stopped in place, relieved.

"All the strategy and achievement in the world is pointless without friends and family, without something more to fight for," he continued, and Neil knew he was thinking of his recent near-breakdown caused by trying to take the entire world on his shoulders alone. "Take the truck. And half of us to protect it, and you. Some weapons, too, to defend yourselves."

"Showman's on the main road with Kumari," Neil said, not quite believing he was actually going to get to go after his wife.

"I'll go too," Grayson volunteered. "Better than working the fields again."

Quickly, the men unloaded the truck except for a few canisters of gas and two crates whose contents would help protect them from whatever may come. Grayson hopped in the back, and, at the wheel for the first time, Neil pressed the gas pedal with a soaring sense of exhilaration. How long had it been since he'd driven? The very last time had been during his and Rani's flight from their own world so very long ago, and now he was driving again, remembering old skills, and in pursuit of the woman he loved.

Showman was on the main road as promised, and he climbed into the cab with a smile as big as Kumari's. The little girl cooed happily at seeing her father again, and Neil nearly cried with joy.

"That way," Showman indicated. "They say there's a decent road from here on out, worn down by the marching millions."

Neil floored it.

Showman teased, "You seem excited. I gotta get myself a looker like Rani, or that Casey."

"I think dibs is called on both," Neil shot back with a laugh. "Though the order of the day for humanity is, apparently, having babies, so I'm sure there are some takers out there."

"The ladies do love my accent."

Grayson said through the back window, "It's all families and crap out here. Not a big market for singles. Not like the big campfire parties back in the farm realities."

Showman gave a deep and lecherous laugh. "*Those* were the days. Nothing like the fall of civilization to fuel going off."

The three men carried on in a great mood for several hours, until it was time for at least two of them to sleep. Neil drove on, passing family after family walking along the road. Each looked up with tired eyes, but there could be no stopping for any reason. Every moment of anticipation and hope was also a moment that Rani might reach the Waystation and pass into the next world forever.

But there was a reason to stop, maybe seven hours further in, when he simply couldn't continue with the pain in his bladder. A mere two minutes couldn't make the difference, could it? There hadn't been any refugees on the road in a half hour or so, but he still pulled off into the woods out of sight. The other two men had been knocked clear under by the day's hard farm labor, so they groaned awake only as the truck came to a stop.

"We here?" Showman asked.

"No. Just stopping for, uh, necessities," Neil said, jumping out and waddling off toward a tree with a stance deeper than Casey's had been.

The relief was amazing, and he stood for a few moments and stared out into a forest lit in dappled green and grey by a beautiful dawn cresting somewhere beyond the trees. Something he interpreted as a fly touched his ear, and he batted it away automatically; a split second later, a tremendous shock hit his senses as something exploded inches away. A squealing dominated that closest ear, fueling adrenaline, and he turned to struggle with the gun that had nearly just killed him.

Using a kick Edgar had taught him, Neil sent Grayson sprawlingbut the lanky man retained control of the gun, and Neil leapt desperately down on top of him and tried to wrestle it away. He received a broken nose from Grayson's forehead for his effort, and the combination of multiple stuns in a few short seconds made him lose his grip.

"What's going on?" Showman roared, rushing over from the truck with Kumari in his arms. Upon seeing that there was no external threat, and that Grayson had his gun out and pointed at Neil, he froze. "What drongo crap is this?"

Grayson recovered his footing and pointed the gun at both of them in turn.

"The hell's wrong with you?" Showman asked, turning Kumari away as he realized Grayson was serious.

The little girl scrunched up her face and began to cry.

"He tried to kill me," Neil forced out, climbing to his knees while he held his broken and bleeding nose.

"I'm taking those weapons in the truck," Grayson said, his eyes wild. "And I can't kill you, because we can't die. I was just knocking you out so you'd have no idea what happened. Now, though"

Kumari's crying grew louder.

"will you shut her up?! Now I'll have to find somewhere to leave you two, like in that spider forest, where you can't rat me out."

Neil glared in anger and horror. "You wouldn't."

Showman made a move, but Grayson swung the gun toward him, halting him in place. "Best not," the lanky man said. "I can make this worse for you the more you piss me off." He began to sidle toward the truck. "Get her quiet!"

"I can't," the Aussie said, holding her close.

"First time she's ever cried in as long as she's been around," Grayson spat. "Your kid's retarded, Neil."

Furious, Neil shot back, "So that's where you got that sack of stuff back at the Zkirax tunnels, isn't it? You lied to people and they gave it to you thinking you were some sort of savior." 

Using one hand to hold the gun at them and the other to reach over into the truck bed and open one of the crates, Grayson laughed. "Suckers."

"Bastard," Showman muttered. Slowly, he lowered Kumari to the ground. "I thought we could work this out, but you're just a snake."

"Curse me all you want. You'll have all the time in the world when those spiders are eating you every day." He shot Showman in the thigh, and the wounded man grunted and fell to his knees. Grayson's eyes shifted to Neil. "Bet your retarded little girl will cry then."

There was no choice. Neil had his own gun, and Edgar had secretly trained him to use it. Whipping it out from the back of his pants and under his shirt, he held it pointed it at Grayson. "Stop now."

The other man evaluated the distance between them and sneered. "Alright, *dad*, like I'm scared" He stopped as the shot hit him in the arm. Realizing he'd underestimated his opponent, Grayson put both hands on his gun, aimed, and fired as another shot hit him in the leg.

Neil didn't see much after that. He had only the resounding sensation of pain in his forehead, the sounds of Kumari screaming and cryingand the back of his skull exploding outwards.

Darkness ruled.

Edgar had been right about that. There was only darkness, and a cosmic rushing sensation. He was not moving at all, but he was moving somewhere at great speed, and he had nothing but eternity for his own thoughts and memories to rebound and recycle in the great cage without limits that was his own mind. There was the roar of something beyond imagination approaching, and the absolute silence of permanent and perfect solitude. His memories distilled down to core images, all that remained of what he wanted and loved and sought, and he saw many things. His earlier life was a vague fog, while Rani's face dominated. He swirled around a titanic circular waterfall pouring ivory waters into the unknownwas this the great white hole Edgar had described? Thousands, no, millions of screaming souls circled Charybdis in agony and ultimate need. They clamored to one another with infinite overlapping shouts of love and hate and remorse; he screamed his own request, to know if anyone had seen his wife. Consumed with their own pains and longings, none answered, save one, a mere whisper in his ear. His only relief was that Rani was not there.

The ivory waters picked up speed, and he would have cried out of fear had he had eyes. The screaming here was more intense as countless souls swirled at terrifying speed into the unknown and glare that could not be beheld or withstood. The last image seared onto his mind's eye was that of his daughter playing in the truck at Wecelo's tomb: after batting at the toy hanging on the string for long enough to realize it would never give her what she wanted, she grabbed the string itself instead, using it to seize control and keep the toy in her grasp forever.

As the searing white faded, he tumbled forward into his own body once again. Disorientation and dizziness dominated, but there was no time for delay. He ran forward, grabbed the knife Showman offered up before him, and charged in with a mortal scream of rage.

Grayson took the knife to the chest with a look of shockand fell.

Somewhere, Kumari was still crying.

"Lord, no," Showman gasped, scrambling around in the dirt behind him. The Aussie staggered over on his wounded leg; Neil felt something mushy being poured into the back of his head while Showman continued to cry in agony. "Inothis has to helpLord"

Neil just lay there in shock as his friend packed his brains and bits of his skull back into his head. He could not even take the small relief of unconsciousness; the dead were forced into their bodies against their will, and the darkness avoided them. He tried to process the images he had seen, but their meaning and depth eluded him in his stunned state.

He slowly returned to himself after Showman bandaged up his head and they both had a few minutes to sit, calm Kumari, and watch Grayson's body. With his daughter in his arms, Neil dried her tears, rubbed her back, and played peekaboo with her as best he could. She was all smiles and happiness again in short order, and the two men recovered from their shock along with her happy laughter.

What else was there to do but carry on? Death had come, and death had gone, and nothing had changed about what was needed. With a deep breath, Neil resolved not to agonize over what had happened to him until he found Rani and had a chance to process it.

Noon came, and Showman got up and kicked Grayson's corpse. He checked the lanky man's eyes for reaction to light. "He's not faking. How long is this supposed to take?"

Neil shook his headand felt the contents slosh around. "I was back in seconds. Someone else I know might have been out for days, but that was awhile ago, when this was all first beginning."

They couldn't spare anymore time, but they also couldn't leave him to run amok once he returned. They loaded Grayson's body into the back of the truck, and Showman remained alongside to keep watch. The remaining drive to the Waystation passed without incident, but, even as they met denser lines of refugees on the final approach across the lush green valley said to hold the last outpost of humanity, Grayson did not stir. </TEXT>

I can say with complete certainty that you are the only writer who's work I could read every day from sunup to sundown and never tire of it. The multiverse is endlessly fascinating and beautifully crafted. Never change, my friend.

	<TEXT> Neil carefully traced his way along the high stone walkway to avoid ancient debris and recent vine growth. "It's not really safe to be up here. This place is very old."

With the book closed and in his lap, Edgar remained on his perch at the crumbled edge of what had once been a grand balcony. Coming up behind him, Neil saw what his friend was looking at: a massive vista that had not been apparent at all on their forested drive up to the ancient church. The mountains behind them framed either corner of his vision in the distance, and the land sloped down in various shades of green life and traces of white snow. The day was clear and the sky bright blue, a sharp contrast to the dark waters of the ocean on the horizon. The sense of space was palpable, the world a vast expanse that promised and delivered infinity.

"Come on," Neil said after taking it all in and forcing himself to ignore it. "Let's go join the others."

"And do what?" Edgar asked, pained. "Look at this. Nature, the worldit's enormous. And this is just the smallest fraction of one Earth, which is itself the tiniest fraction of human-habitable Earths in this base branch, which is just one of an infinite number of branches of existence. So we can't die? To walk one universe and know it completely would be an impossible feat, and there are countless realities. Even if we had a trillion years, we couldn't walk the multiverse end to end. We are, by definition, small. Nothing. We can't win. Time and entropy will get us all in the end."

Realizing this wasn't going to be an easy conversation, Neil sat on the dirty stone and gazed down at the grounds before the church where the other men were loading what they could on the truck. "That's grim. But look."

Kumari was visible in the window of the truck, carefully tied and secured, her stubby arms batting at a hanging toy Showman had rigged up with a piece of string.

"That's all you gotta do, Edgar. You don't have to cross a universe or resist reality-bending empresses from a thousand years ago. You only have to have kids, or take care of other people's kids, and do a tiny bit better than your parents did. If we each keep doing a tiny bit better" He laughed at Kumari's adaptation. His little daughter had realized the toy was strung up, and she now gripped the string instead of the toy itself. "if all of us do a tiny bit better, well, that's our infinity, isn't it?"

Edgar's gaze remained locked on the glimmering ocean. "Better? We had it all. Safety, time, civilization, video games. It was taken from us. We have nothing, now. We're hungry and dirty and driving around an endless wilderness looking for anything that might give us a slim chance at deciding our own fates. And even now, we're losing people. We open up a book, and we make a friend, and then they die because of us."

Neil tore his gaze away from his daughter to regard his friend. "Wecelo lived eight hundred years ago. You should be happy he nearly made it here through his own inventiveness and drive. That's amazing, isn't it? It's not a tragedy. His life without knowing us, without knowing that he matteredthat would have been a tragedy." He sighed. "And I'm not sure we were really better off behind that Shield, anyway."

"Oh yeah?"

"Rani's a fighter like you, and I think she understood more of that world than I ever did. Our fates weren't our own there, either. It was like an invisible glass cage surrounding us at all times. We could test it, realize it was there, and even understand who had built it, but the money and the power were always in the hands of smug bastards, sociopaths, and amoral politicians. It's easier to see it now that our lives are actually in our own hands. I haven't paid a bill in years. Haven't worked somewhere I hated doing pointless repetitive garbage to make someone else rich. If I could just find Rani, I would have everything I want. In the end, none of that other stuff mattered."

Edgar's long unkempt hair flapped in the conflicting mountain winds and sea breezes as he listened, motionless.

"What do you want, Edgar?"

He closed his eyes for a long moment, and, to Neil, he seemed momentarily an exhausted shell of a man. It was easy to forget that his unshaven and long-haired friend had been traveling for months without end, through countless random dangers, a personal encounter with Her Glory, and even death itself. How did he keep going? After finally opening his eyes, Edgar seemed to draw in the chill air in a long breath, taking strength from the scents of both the mountain and the sea. "I just wanna see my friends again, if I'm being honest. I don't think I can do this lone wolf thing, even if Ward Shaw thinks it's necessary. If I fuck up, people die, and I'm tired of everyone dying."

"Well, we can't anymore, so at least that's not an issue."

That actually made Edgar grimace and laugh despite himself. "Oh, God. Yeah. That's going to get far worse before it gets better, if it even will get better. Death is our get-out-of-horror-free card. If it's been taken away, all our fates will eventually be, by definition, worse than death. We're going to have to fight to the last, and beyond, if we're going to fix this. Throw ten Hail Mary plays and put all our cards in every single one."

Neil nodded. "The only defense we have against nightmare is the power of self-sacrifice."

Edgar looked up sharply. "What did you just say?"

He shrugged. "Just something I heard once."

"Really." Edgar grew dour and looked down at the men as they took a break to drink water and eat some military rations. "Grayson's not to be trusted."

"What happened?"

"Shaw's no fool. He used the book on each of us after you left his office."

"And Grayson?"

"The book refused to show Shaw anything but a single horrifying episode from Grayson's life. With Wes, learning that the content the text presents is intimately tied to the perspective of the soul being interrogatedthat's a clue. I don't think Grayson was a Grey Rider, or, if he was, he took a very strange path to get there." Edgar narrowed his eyes. "And then he defected. Somehow"

"So he's not from the future?" Neil asked, aghast. Why would anyone claim such a thing if it wasn't true? He himself hadn't entirely believed it when he'd overheard Grayson's speech to the people in the caves, but it had seemed to give them hope.

"Can't be sure," Edgar said quietly. "But Shaw said he would let that rumor spread to keep morale up."

Strange. Neil gulped. "So what happened in this, uh, episode?"

"Grayson did not come off as a good person. Hard to say when it was, or where." 

"Then why not leave him behind? Send him somewhere else?"

"Because someone was reading about us, and events conspired to put him in that room. He might be important. We can't know which of us will be needed."

"Ah."

They both quieted for a time.

Neil brushed a pebble of stone over the edge and watched it bounce down to the ground far below. "You should go back to your friends."

"Everybody thinks I'm dead. That's why it has to be me. My cover will be blown if I do that."

"Will it? Shaw said that the people we're up against are so paranoid that you being exactly perfectly yourself will just convince them you're not you."

Edgar's despair fell away in an awed breath, and his chest shook subtly a few times. "Holy crap, you're right."

"Then let's go. Let's get you to your family."

"Wait. One last thing." He opened the book. "Tell me about the next threat we'll encounter."

The pages remained blank.

"Tell me about the most important thing we need to know about the future."

Nothing happened.

"Damn. I was worried about this."

"What's the issue?"

"It can only connect to the future by connecting to itself, I think. Someone has to be reading about us, and probably with respect to ranges and vicinities, or something. So it's not really reading the future, it's communicating to the past."

"That would have been great if it worked. It was worth a shot."

"Yeah."

They stoodeven as shouting came from below. Neil ran with his friend down along the ancient and uneven steps of the church. They both burst out the front as the argument escalated into shoving.

"We have to use these weapons to go kick some Zkirax ass!" Cantey shouted.

Mashburn shook his head and grunted, "That's not the plan, kid."

"I'm not a kid, old man. And I've got people back there I care about."

"So do I. You think just 'cause my beard's white I can't love no more?"

Showman pushed between them. "Guys, a fight won't solve anything. Come on." They shoved at each other a bit more, but he held both of them back until they stalked to opposite corners of the clearing.

"What *is* the plan?" Grayson asked from his seat under a tree where he'd paused to drink from his canteen.

Edgar looked to each of them before making his decision. "We're going to go get allies. After that, we'll worry about the Zkirax, the Grey Riders, Her Glory, and any other takers."

Neil nodded hopefully to Showman, who showed his support, and Mashburn, Cantey, and Grayson all eventually shrugged and moved to get back to work.

"How can I help?" Neil asked, but Edgar grabbed some ammo and a second pistol and led him into the woods.

"Time for another lesson." Edgar glanced back at Grayson as the path curved and the men moved out of sight. "I want you to know how to defend yourself, just in case." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I'm just starting to write myself and I really look towards you as an inspiration.

If you have any questions, feel free to shoot them my way!

  Also, I'm so engrossed in the story and I want other people to be as well, I've already recommended it to everyone I know who might be interested. I'm currently trying to keep the multiverse reading guide up to date for newcomers too and plan on updating/adding a bunch of entries real soon.

This is all the best thing ever. I truly appreciate it.

 I know this is a crap ton of text but really thanks for writing these stories.

Thank *you* for reading. I would absolutely not have the same output if I was posting to an empty subreddit :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Just curious I know a lot of people compared your multiverse story to Steven King's Dark Tower series, have you ever read any King or the Dark Tower series itself? If so do you take any inspiration from it? 

I actually haven't read any King that I know of, besides his story "The Long Walk" under a pseudonym, but his work is so ubiquitous I'm sure it has influenced me. I've definitely seen and loved some of his movies, like Thinner, the Shawshank Redemption, the Mist, the Dead Zone, 1408... wow there's a huge list. The thing about King is that his work got to me in the form of movies as a kid before I ever hit horror as a book genre, so by the time I had the opportunity, I kept coming across his books and thinking, "Didn't I already see this movie?"

He's just too successful! What a terrible problem to have :)

 P.S. I recently came across this thread, wondering if this idea is completely dead or if you're still down for others adding to your multiverse with side stories.

Absolutely! People are still writing, making videos, and doing narrations all the time. Feel free to join in! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I know next to nothing about subreddit moderation, but are you able to change the default sorting for comment threads for these stories? Currently, the default is set to new which means when you continue the story in the comments section it is possible to see minor spoilers in the comments before finishing the story. Obviously I'm aware I can change the sorting to top or best but it would be nice if the story continued directly below by default. Just a minor annoyance.

Hmm. I'll look into that right now. I guess it never occurred to me that my own comments are always at the top by default in my view!

edit: Done, they're all on 'oldest comment first' mode as far as I can tell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I understand that Lian realized that they were connected to The First World and that they were trying to hide that fact so it's a logical jump to assume they must be from one of the Amber Worlds, but how did she know it was Amber Two? There were 8 different Amber worlds and only Amber Four and Amber Eight were confirmed to have been destroyed when the shield generation systems overloaded. I'm just curious as to why she immediately realized this was Amber Two and not one of the other 5 Amber Worlds? Or did I miss something?

Lian accidentally pulled a sticker down and saw the original symbols underneath. They're very distinctive (a gold '2' is prominent in this case). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A tiny nitpick: Why did they had to send the uncle to track Wes down, if they had cellphones and stuff? Couldn't they just call, or did he forget the charger back at home? :P

We may never know, but it's likely that Wes was out of coverage range by running around in places like Japan or North America.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It had taken the better part of a month to scam our way into the job, but, now that we were in, things were moving quickly. You were either in or not in these kinds of organizations; I just hoped we could get back *out* once this was all over. I wasn't sure why I was still helping, but I think it had something to do with embarrassment. Guy was fiercely focused and never wavered. I felt like a scumbag in comparison, and didn't want to make that self-assessment grow.

I'd never really thought about myself with an objective critical eye before, but seeing hints of the true scope of existence had forced me to make a sober re-evaluation of many things. It had begun with hope that there was *actually something more* and then evolved into this mad quest to save one comatose girl from eternal torture.

The city of gold and bronze glinted in the evening sun; high corners flashed colored bits of light from the blazing sky. Carrying box after box from the sailing ships harbored across from the warehouse we'd found the month before, Guy and I did our best to shut up, blend in, and see what we could see. Death was not in attendance this time, and, for that, I was utterly thankful. I was almost entirely sure that horrid silhouette with ruby eyes hadn't seen me before I'd woken up, but his mere presence had left me permanently shaken. The Reaper was real, and involved in the drug trade. Existence was far stranger than I could have ever guessedunless something more sinister than profit was at stake.

That night, with our unloading job done, we stood around in the warehouse with a half-dozen other guys and drank grey wine from curiously elaborate glasses whose shared style was a source of renown for the dream-city's glassblowing district. None of these men were cultured or particularly intelligent, undoubtedly a secret profile for the job, so the conversation centered around confusion. Were these dream people real? They appeared to have lives, and eat, and sleep, and other things, but none of us had ever truly followed one to see all these various behaviors present in a continuous manner. It was possible they were all just imagined set pieces for an illusionary city.

One bearded and solemn southern man askedbut who dreams it when we're not here?

For that, we had no answer.

They sent us home with pay with enough time to get back before sunset. Behind me, Guy lingered for just a moment and watched the sailing ships heave anchor, turn, and depart.

I told him, "Don't draw attention."

"That's where we need to beon those ships."

"We'll get there. Organizations like this are built on trust." I proceeded along the wharf to dispel any sense in onlookers that he and I were associates, and the world began to change and fade as my Remy wore off. I'd found a good spot by then, and arrived on my feet on a mossy patch of flat rock next to a creek in the woods that served as the dream-city's real-world analog. I saw several of the other guys on the long night-walk out, but we each instinctively knew not to speak to one another. Off the job, we were not buddies.

Once home, Guy and I sat around my table and drew maps of what we knew.

"The volume of product is nearly industrial," I told him. "And I bet they have incredible distribution advantages because the distances in the dream world can be shorter. Like that forest we keep dropping intoit's thirty miles out of town, but we didn't walk nearly that far to get there."

His thoughts were elsewhere. "Even if we get on one of those shipseven if we find the source of all this, there's a solid chance they don't know anything about the Beast. This could all be a waste."

"No." I snapped my fingers at him. "Focus. There is no way an organization of this size knows nothing about that thing. It dominates their environment, and drug cartels do nothing better than navigating their environment. They know what it is and how it behaves. They have to."

Mollified for the moment, he accepted that.

I knew he was itching to do something, and that every day we delayed meant another eternity of suffering for his friendI'd witnessed a small bit of it firsthand, after allbut I also knew that he was his own greatest liability. These Remy-runners had no idea we had another agenda, and there was no way they would find out unless one of us did something stupid.

In the meantime, during daylight hours, we went about our respective lives. He knew nothing of me, and I knew nothing of him, as was safe. However, when we met up to plan, we discussed how the world was changing.

Remy was spreading quickly as the drug of choice in our city, and undoubtedly in many others. I'd had no doubt that would be the case. For most, it was a safe and amazing trip into another mode of existence. For some, it was a panacea for grief; at night, the local cemeteries became increasingly littered with high parents talking to their lost children, family members reminiscing with dead siblings, and do-gooders trying to provide absolution for unfinished business to any willing ghosts.

The traffic balance of the hours shifted. It had become safer to meet during daylight hours when the ghosts remained unseen and unheard even with Remy augmenting one's senses, for too many people were walking and driving about in the night.

There were no media reports of any of this. Polite society refused to entertain the notion entirely. The news, obviously, stuck to the parroted talking points its owners had set forth. Police began cracking down *hard* on those who possessed any amount of Remy, but it didn't matter. Prohibition had never worked, and it only made the spread worse now as people developed connections and methods to buy Remy safely and anonymously.

And that meant increased work for us. They already paid us well, but now we were in the dream-world more or less full time, unloading a growing number of ships and personally taking product to dealers when the organization became short-handed. It wasn't the direction Guy wanted to gowe were interacting more with the real world and dealers rather than sailing across those unknown seas into deeper dream worldsbut I knew it was progress.

The opportunity came when our Boss ran afoul of a strange morphic dream-beast that sometimes roamed the air above that dark blue marble pathway just under the ocean waters. It at first appeared to be a mocking white mask shrouded by a dark hood, and tried to ensnare him in a black bodybagbut Guy and I applied our knives, and our perception of the thing became a floating blob of hungry dark blue goo that had wrapped a pulsating tentacle around the man's waist.

We slashed to little effect, but Guy brought out a lighterdid he smoke? I'd never seen him do soand the slightest flame sent the nightmare-blob floating away at speed.

Boss looked to the other guys in our crew and berated them. Some made excuses about the path being narrow, but he spat tobacco chew at them with disgust.

We were in. He didn't say anything about it, but I knew, especially when we were left alone with a shipment and cash for the first time at the warehouse we'd first infiltrated. The movements of men to other duties seemed random, but I gave Guy a heads up and we both went out for a smoke. He refused my offer of a cigarettehmm. Meanwhile, I looked around. In the shifting distance, without giving away that I saw, I pinpointed two watchers. It was a test.

We passed, of course. Guy's goal wasn't drugs or money, and my goal had yet to be defined. When Boss came back and there was not even a single pill or dollar missing, he said nothing and went about his work. Two days later, just before we went to unload more boxes from one of the sailing ships, he grunted and motioned for us to step aside. Two new recruits had taken our places.

Boss stood against the ancient wooden railing and smoked a cigar while the minutes passed in ocean-breeze silence. Guy and I stood unmoving. We had only to wait.

His cigar finished, the older man threw it in the ocean. "Ah, hell with it. It's hard to trust these days. You boys want a promotion?"

I took the lead in responding. "Seems it's already been given."

"It has. Boss" He meant his Boss, since no names were used here. "is always lookin' for fresh blood. This Remy stuff wears on ya, rots your brain maybe, or scum always seems to float to the top, or power, uh, corrupts. Or all three mebe." He turned his milky eyes toward the sunset. "Beautiful, inninit?"

Guy couldn't help himself. "Sir, are you blind in the real world?"

"Sir?" He gave a life-long smoker's cough-laugh. "You're a good kid. I ain't your Boss no more. Take another pill and go with the ship."

This was it. We'd never been allowed to stay in this shard of the realm past sunset, and we'd certainly never been told anything about where the ships went.

While the crew manned the riggings and sail, Guy and I stood at the rail and watched as we sailed into the sunset in a rather literal manner. The sky came down to meet the dark waters in an actual blaze of gold and crimson fire as long as the horizon. The intense colored light and roiling steam surrounded us for a time, but there was not nearly the heat we'd expected.

It occurred to me that I'd never felt hot in a dream before. I'd felt the *effects* of heat, such as sweating and exhaustion, but never heat itself. Guy didn't flinch. Determined, he waited for the next dreamscape to show itself.

Without landmarks to break up the dream, we covered a great distance in a short time. The landmass ahead looked normal at first, but we both realized we weren't just seeing a beach by starlight. This was a desert, truly, and it was likely infinite in scope.

Some distance back, there towered a titanic rectangular glass with one high corner cut at an angle. The stars beyond it were red, and the night sky purple. Seven parallel beams of glowing dark blue light ran from somewhere within it, out into our sky, and off to the right, which I believed to be north. Like the door in the warehouse that had led us to the oceanic island that hosted the unnamed city of gold and bronze, this was a passage to Elsewherebut infinitely grander in scope. The rising moon backlit the frame, and my knuckles went white on the wooden rail as I realized just how big the glass prism was.

"We can't turn back now," Guy murmured.

I scanned the deck quickly, re-confirming how outnumbered we were. Trying to escape would just seal our fate. The only way out was forward into the unknown.

The ship ground right up onto the sand, and, without a Boss for the first time, we did our best to help. The crew waved us off after the first few loads, and told us they had it from there. Go on ahead, they said, and don't stray; the Gateway awaited we who would wander. Best not to enrage it.

"That's not ominous at all," I joked, but Guy was already making his way up the starlit dunes. I followed as quick as I could, and we slogged our way across the sands toward that Scraper of the Sky, that Glass Gateway, whose seven beams of dark blue light traced perfect parallel paths toward the distant north for reasons I feared we would soon discover firsthand. </TEXT>

**I could kill you, but you could wound me before you suffocated on the blood of your own nervous and circulatory systems melting. We are at an impasse, then. Go, and never return.**

---

Crawling into the shallow waters of a distant beach, I retched, rolled over, and collapsed. The pain still arced between every nerve.

"If you had actually hit that moon," Edgar panted. "Oh my godI don't even know what would have happened. The entity inside it doesn't wake for another eight hundred years, and when it does, the subsequent events are instrumental in our surviving the Crushing Fist!"

Water sloshed along my side as a wave came in from the green ocean. I gasped, "The Crushing Fist? What's that?"

Edgar looked back to make sure his friends weren't watching. "I think it's time we got serious about using this connection to our advantage."

I used the book more sparingly after that, only contacting Edgar when needed, for each response cost him precious time, while I had months and years to enact our plans and my thefts. I celebrated my seventeenth and eighteenth birthdays alone, but not alone. Meanwhile, his friend Neil got to work identifying weak points and drilling through the basement levels of my church-tomb to access the caches I'd already planned to hide. This, Edgar said, was his engineer friend's whole reason for coming. He had the structural and machine knowledge to access secrets buried well enough that they would remain hidden for eight hundred years. Their advantage, too, was that I could tell them exactly where I'd hid them.

Not well enough, I suppose. The first secret chamber had already been broken into, and was empty. I'd stashed the purple beam weapon theredamnit. I *loved* that thing. But Edgar told me it was fine, he'd expected that. The rest of our hidden weapons and technology from across the multiverse would remain hidden beyond the current strife and into a time when it wasas he put it, *temporally safe*to retrieve them. His friends were already through most of the chambers as I neared my nineteenth birthday, and he told me, with some concern, that the last hidden secret held a stone sarcophagus he believed to be my final resting place. 

It was just confirmation of what I'd already wanted. My tasks were done, my purpose fulfilled. My term of pain was due for relief. A life without love and belonging was no life at all, and the men reading about me from the future were only proof that I would die alone. There had never been any mention of a family for Wecelo the Thief; for relatives and relations, I had, still, only my trusty knife. I held it up and studied it in the light of the sun often that spring.

There were two final concerns to which I needed to attend. I located a navigation chip and slunk once more into the pink-and-cyan exo-reality, but there were no longer any laborers or engineers present. I found that rather odd. This was a place of some importance, now an oubliette for dangerous technology and devices found among the nearby multiverse. Where was Her Glory? Where was the promised immigration of my mother's people? To these questions, neither I nor Edgar had any answer.

For him, three days had passed, and a snowstorm was coming on.

For me, it had been years. I stood facing a pedestal that I knew would be seen by any truly curious stranger. I'd often found that this book never let itself be left behind, but I wasn't abandoning it. I was giving it to someone. It was to be found by a mercurial goddess of destruction and salvation who opposed Her Glory someday centuries hence, and I knew that was important, but it would also mean giving up the only true family I had left. In the last two years, running about the worlds drinking, stealing, bragging, fighting, and living to the fullest, I had never cried. I did now. "I don't want to say goodbye."

"I know," Edgar replied softly.

"You're my best friend."

He said, "It's only been a few days for me, but I feel like I know you intimately. You're brave, and relentlessly true to yourself. I'm honored."

Heartbroken, I closed the pages and placed the book on the pedestal. To think, eight hundred years later, someone would come looking that was an unthinkable gap, crossable only by titans of the era like Her Glory and my grandmother. Technology was the key, but such outcasts as I would never have access to what they had.

The tribeless orphans of Oraibi were my second and final interest. I returned to great aplomb, for the children had become young men and women and then gained status and respect in their own right. Their efforts had changed the city for the better, and they remembered me. The world had become more integrated by that time, too, and my exploits had spread in some small fashion.

My uncle had gone back to the homelands of my mother's people to help against the threat thereand never returned. My mother still refused to speak to me, and my brother and sister followed her lead as head of the family. I was beloved by many strangers, and even managed to steal for the greater good for another two or three years, but the weight of loneliness soon overtook me. Can you still hear me, Edgar? Are you still reading the river of my life?

I told Peter of my plans, and he promised to commission a great church for me at the base of whichever mountain range might be afforded, for some of my favorite times had been among the mountains. That construction, too, took some number of years, but I waited through the seasons with a distant heart. At long last, I bid Peter farewell, hid well the prizes I'd sought in my late youth, and committed to my exit with one last act by my faithful knife.

It was a beautiful church, as you know. I can see it here, uneroded by the vagaries of time, and I can imagine you sitting on the stone floor and talking to me someday. You gave me purpose, meaning, and support in a world that just doesn't want me. I can't say my life has ever been free of painful confusion and ostracization, but I want you to know that, for what you've been to me, I love you.

---

Edgar let the book fall to the floor. There were no more words on the page, but the struggle of an entire misplaced life had hit him in the gut with a force not to be denied. "You didn't."

But Wecelo had.

Walking down to the last chamber in a daze, Edgar stood by the sarcophagus. "You ready to open it?"

Neil fiddled with a few jerry-rigged controls. "Yeah. Are you sure you want to? Forty years of decay is not going to be pretty."

"He's done it, either way. We owe him this."

"Alright."

The internal technological mechanisms of the sarcophagus ground to life and slid the stone lid back inch by inch over the course of a full minute. There was no smell. The hibernation systems had lasted over seven centuries, but the power cell had finally shorted out forty years or so before.

Wecelo the Thief had so very nearly made it home.

"Who's that?" Neil asked, confused.

"It's Wes."

"But"

Edgar raised a hand to cut him off. "Wecelo will be remembered the way Wecelo wants to be remembered. Don't tell Showman. Or Cantey. Or Mashburn. Or anyone." He then touched the well-preserved corpse's soft cheek. Bits of long golden hair littered the corners, fallen where Wecelo had cut it short one last time. "I'm so sorry. They had technology to match ours, but not understanding. For what it's worth, we would have accepted you the way you were."

Neil turned his gaze away. "HeWecelo knew. I know he did. That's why he tried to reach us."

Clenching his fists and fighting back a powerful pain full of memories of Rachel dead and Mona lost, Edgar stormed away. "I can't fucking handle this anymore. I want to go home."

"Home's gone," Neil called after him, his eyes falling back on the body in the sarcophagus. A small wooden figurine of a man sat clutched between those two unmoving hands. Softer, he said, "But thanks to you, Wes, maybe we can win it back." </TEXT>

Observing all this, I offered, "I could send a letter through my mother and make sure Verene knows to tell each of you what she needs to tell you."

"Not just yet, Wes," Edgar replied.

Liking that nickname, I smiledbut the intense cold began getting to me. My hands were numb, and I was feeling woozy.

"Wecelo?" Neil said. "Are you well enough to make a portal now?"

I nodded weakly.

"You should try, alright?"

Crawling forward in the snow, I tumbled under the bole of an enormous tree in some distant dark jungle. It was warm and humid, and I slept rather forcibly. It was not nearly the first night I'd spent half-conscious from a vicious beating, but it was the first time I was alright with someone else knowing. Whoever this Edgar and Neil were, and their friends Cantey, Showman, and Mashburnwell, I trusted them for some reason. For the first time while away from my father, I felt *not alone.*

When consciousness returned in the green light of jungle-dawn, I checked the book, and immediately saw Neil's unspoken concern. Traveling home as fast as I could, I found out what my later soul had already known and told them: my father had died two weeks after I'd left in pursuit of the book.

My mother was in a back room of the house, still grieving and alone. I stood there, silent, as she screamed words harsh and cold at me. She raised her hand to strike me, and I almost wish she had. Instead, she turned away, and said nothing further no matter how much I pleaded. Some part of me understood that she was heartbroken in a tremendous way, but my father had always been the one to carve out a space for me in a family and community to which I did not belong. I would never be welcome back. That much I understood.

Tears found me again despite my best efforts. I ran to worlds strange and jagged, and found refuge among crags of sapphire. I was more certain of the need to take the honorable way out than ever before; my selfish crashing about in life had damaged my family's reputation and cost my father and mother dearly. Why couldn't I just be what they wanted me to be? Wouldn't have it been easier to pretend? I opened the book to talk to my future-people one last time.

Edgar put a compassionate hand along the book's edge. "Neil, can I have a moment alone with him?"

"Yeah." He stood and took Kumari over to play with Cantey.

Now alone, Edgar said, "Wes, I know a bit about what you're going through."

"How could you?" I asked, distraught. The drop over the edge of the sapphire crags would be enough to end it in a rather abrupt and brutal manner, and the horrible wrenching pain inside me demanded relief in the only way I knew how. He couldn't possibly understand. What did he look like?

Edgar was a light-skinned man on the thinner side, with long brown unkempt hair and a face he himself considered unattractive at the moment due to his ragged unshaven beard and moustache.

Edgar frowned. "Hey!"

Despite my tears, I laughed. "You're the man you want to be, aren't you?"

He grew solemn. "I do take pleasure in the trials I face. To conquer with intelligent choices, to surpass the possible by finding a third optionI'm a gamer at heart, and I'm living it."

"Not me," I countered. "Every single community I come across seems alien and awkward to me."

Blowing out a long breath, Edgar said, "Hey, being a gamer means the same thing for me. Nobody gets my references." He spoke quietly enough that the others would not hear. "And I know a bit about suicide and pain. I, uh I was with someone, in love with someone, who shot herself in the head. I was supposed to do it, too."

Horrified, I asked, "Why?"

"The walls of the world had broken down, and nightmares were flooding in." Edgar gulped. "Strangely enough, I now know the horrible black spheres drilling into people's heads outside were Her Glory's defensive machines gone haywire thanks to the Devastation scrambling everything. But that day, we knew nothing but the certainty of a horrible death ahead."

"But you didn't die."

"You're right. I took the cowardly route and ran, even after Rachel had shot herself in the head and died in front of me. I wasn't honorable at all, but here I am, trying to fight the good fight. It doesn't end for you here. Those sapphire crags are not where you die. I know, because I'm literally sitting in a church atop your tomb."

It was my turn to gulp, in an effort to hold back more tears. "So what do I do?"

"Great things," Edgar whispered. "You're uniquely positioned. You've got people in the future to give you information nobody else could possibly know, you can control portals, and you're smart and strong."

I actually blushed. "No."

"Yes. Get to work, Wecelo."

In the distance, I could see floating white jellyfish-like creatures tending to emerald farms. A few advance scouts of the Grand Project had reported beings like these, but initial contact had yielded no communication.  "Edgar?"

"Yes?"

"What does my soul say about my first big heist?"

A wide smile crossed Edgar's features as he read. "Oh *yes.*"

Taking his advice, I portaled to where the resources of the amethyst pyramids were being focused to grow a new weapon. The energy source was one of a kind, something they'd salvaged from another reality and adapted to their own crystalline biology, but how my future soul knew this, I couldn't tell. The agitation caused by humanoids entering their domain had caused them to advance and evolve in new ways, and this was the most major attempt at adaptation.

The homeworld and heart of this shard of the Gemstone Hegemony was beautiful and incredible; beyond language, beyond insult by description through mere words. A geode reality, not artificial, but naturally grown in the shell of anotherbeyond that I will not say, not even through the words of my soul, for I could sense they asked only for respect and privacy even as I shouted like the dumb teenager that I was and stole their greatest weapon. It was an impossible theft made possible by exact information from the future and the ability to tunnel between realities at will; I almost felt sorry for them.

But I felt less sorry as I found an uninhabited world and sliced the tops off of mountain ranges with that incredible purple beam. The weapon hadn't been made for human hands, but I'd carved away enough excess amethyst to approximate a crude trigger. Screaming with glee, I carved the world like a god. No kickback, no heat; this was pure power, fueled by eight purple biostones that seemed to serve as some sort of neurological and biological energy channel from exo-physics unknown. They were connected and seemed to act in coordination, but how, I couldn't tell.

"You're not going to hurt anybody with that, are you?" Edgar asked.

I could almost feel him standing next to me on that snow-covered mountaintop. The reality of this weapon's use brought me down from my high. "No, I suppose not."

"You're not Wecelo the Murderer, after all."

I shrugged. The thought of hurting people made me ill, but I still wanted to act at least a little tough. "Fine." Studying the quiet mountain ranges I'd carved, I realized, "It doesn't destroy things. It just disintegrates themor, actually, I think it's sending the matter someplace else."

That piqued Edgar's interest rather sharply. "Can you tell where?"

I portaled in and out to end up at the smooth rock I'd shot; I traced my fingers across the cold stone. "Wherever it is, it's very far away." I shuddered, both from the altitude's cold and my own memories. "I've been almost that far before. I wouldn't recommend it."

Edgar quietly absorbed that information and did not comment further.

Alone except for my book, and therefore not alone at all, I lay in a small cave and dreamed about the coming years. We talked all night long, which I suspected was a much shorter time for him. I could think about my response for minutes or hours and the book would summarize. Warmed by my small fire, I fell asleep with the book's pages open on my chest.

It was on to Erenia the next day, where I stood on a hilltop above a city bustling with humans who knew nothing of my planet. It was one of those not-too-uncommon sister worlds where humanity had also evolved in similar fashion, building civilizations that

"Do you believe in a god or gods, Edgar?" I asked, mortified as I stared up at the sky.

"I honestly don't know," he replied, his mind on a strange experience he didn't want to share with me.

I needed help, more at that moment than ever. "Please tell me."

"I died," he whispered. "And I didn't see anybody. But I didn't really have the chance."

"You're not speaking metaphorically," I breathed, struggling against the terror in my heart. "Edgar, there are two moons here, and *one is alive.*"

He clenched the book hard enough that his knuckles went white.

"It's a giant mind! The whole thing's a mind! It'sit's a brain!" I began screaming and running back toward my portal. "I think it senses me!"

"Get out of there!" Edgar shouted, standing with the book in his hands. "I know where you are, and you have to get away! *You have to get away!*"

But an invisible darkness reached out from that ghastly Moon and paralyzed me at the base of my portal, a mere hand's breadth from escape. Crimson lightning arced through my awareness; blood pain cast at an interloper by a guardian wolf. I already had the book openI gasped, "Tell me about the entity in the sky!"

---

**You think I don't know what you're trying to do, little one? I see you there, groveling in the dirt. I see you trying to crawl away like the worm that you are. Know that the pain you feel now is only the barest fraction of my strength, for I sleep, awaiting the cusp of humanity's**

---

I slung the jagged amethyst device around from my back and fired at the sky.

Edgar screamed, "Wait!"

	<TEXT> My knife was my only friend. Oh, not for violence, like you might be thinking, but as a symbol of my masculinity. I was twelve when I found it lying in a field during several hours spent sullen, bruised, and bitter. I did consider stabbing Heinricus, but I imagined the bully would just overpower me and take my knife the way he'd taken my pride. So, instead, I used the knife to cut my hair extremely short in a fit of self-directed rebellion.
 
Then, proud of my new look, I wandered into town proper and spent another few hours watching the construction of London's first stone bridge. It was the talk of the town, considering that it was being built by laborers rather than Her Glory's machines. She was very busy elsewhere, it was said, and I kicked my feet and watched as a *priest* of all people directed the work crews.
 
This was life as I understood it at the sharp age of twelve. The city was full to the brim with bustling boys, gossiping girls, hard-working men, elegant women, and crying babiesmy father's people, alland none of them cared a whit for me. At best, I garnered subtle apprehension; at worst, a beating. I did head back to the enclave by evening, but I didn't fit in there any better. My mother's people either refused to fit in or were incapable of doing so. Theirs was a culture of elegant mental counterplay and eternal traditions, and they found humans off-putting in many daily ways. Ironically enough, both they and the humans of the city disdained children who just could not shut their mouths and behave properly.
 
My mother scolded me when she saw my hair, and of course I screamed back at her. I remember that fight vividly, because it was the first time I truly began to understand the scope of the despair ahead of me. I said, referring to the other children at the enclave, "They got to *choose* their form! They literally got to pick out their bodies. Not me! I'm stuck with *this!*" and my mother, usually confident and in control, actually misted up. She shook her head and told me, "I was born, just like you. I didn't get to choose my body, and I've lived no less a life for it."
 
She didn't understand. How could she? I was constantly burning inside at the notion that my grandfather had been a being of light that had lived and wandered among the stars, and at the knowledge that I was surrounded by people who were free and spirited and capable of choosing their own form. Many of the recent comers had chosen appearances based on statues of gods and goddesses, and were painfully handsome or beautiful, and here I was, stuck in this pathetic weakling little form with clumsy hands and awkward limbs and an ugly face.
 
I stormed out of the house through a portal. That drew the attention of my father, who followed me soon after with my mother's help. As a full human, he couldn't open gateways the way we could, but he never once let on any hint that it might make him feel lesser. In fact, I was rather afraid of a spanking, even though I was twelve and beyond such things. He tracked me down in the forest I'd retreated to and sat by me as I threw rocks at a creek. Apparently, punishment was not what he had in mind. This, too, I remember in excruciating detail.
 
"It's not safe out here, child," he warned me idly. "You can run off all you like once they're done enclosing the realm. For now, you should come home, and we'll talk."
 
"I can't," I retorted. "I'll just get beat up again. Or I'll beat someone up. Either way, it's all just a bunch of violent shoving and constant vying for position."
 
He laughed. "Yes, boys will be boys, and that is certainly a very human crowd you have fallen in with. I know you haven't gotten along with the other children in the enclave, but maybe you could try again?"
 
"They're not human," I snapped, before amending my reply. "I mean, because mother's half like them, I know I'm a quarter like them, but that means I'm three-quarters *not* like them. They're weird, and they smell, and they don't know how to act. They're like spirits walking around in puppet bodies."
 
His laugh this time was deep, and from the belly. "I can't disagree. Your mother was a strange one, half-spirit as she is, when we were first wed. Time spent outside her community eased her manner as she grew into the woman you know now. You will also grow and conquer life as you come into your own. This is the way of things. Indeed, your brother and sister have gone through the same before you."
 
I was still sullen, but his presence always made me feel better. He seemed to understand how I felt trapped between two worlds. My siblings were only one year and two years older than me, but they'd always seemed at ease in their quarter-spirit bodies, and they were relaxed and accepted among numerous kinds of friends and strangers. Like my mother, they didn't understand. They couldn't.
 
For a time, I threw rocks at the creek and he sat and whittled a small figure of a man out of the wood of a nearby branch. When he was done, he handed it to me, and said, "This is you."
 
"Me?"
 
"Yes. It's you, happy, when you have become the person you want to be. All this will pass one day."
 
He did understand. He was no poet, and he didn't have the deeper words of the soul, but he understood. That was the happiest moment of my life while that age that I can remember; I had no idea that it was soon to be followed by the worst. I took the figurine, studied it, and put it in my pocket to keep as a reminder.
 
He took my hand, and I was ready to return. I don't know why I didn't just open a portal right then and thereI was self-conscious about my non-human abilities, but that wasn't it. I think I just wanted to walk with my father and be a child for a little while longer.
 
It glinted silver on the path, waiting. My father distrusted all things unfamiliar *and* familiar in other realities; he pulled me away from it, only to step on another one hidden behind the next tree. With a whoosh and a crack, the silver noose closed around his leg, and he was jerked up into the sky.
 
I didn't even have time to be afraid. For once, I was thankful for the masculine animal drive inside me; the adrenaline pushed me to action and instinct immediately. I opened a portal back home, surprising my mother on the other side, and then opened a return portal high above where I'd just been. I dove through, grabbed hold of the silver strand in the open sky, and slid down it uncontrollably while I brought my knife around.
 
It didn't work. While the smooth silver slid maddeningly between my hands and I approached my father below at high speed, my knife made no effect. Desperate for something with a little more grain, I pulled out the figurine my father had carvedand the silver gave way to the wood instantly. We both tumbled into open air and would have died if not for my mother soaring between us, grabbing us, and pulling us through a portal of her making. We crashed into the River Thames near the bridge construction I'd watched earlier that day.
 
We'd survived, but the cost had been great. The snapping force of the silver noose had broken my father's back in a way that even the healing devices Her Glory had gifted the city could not heal. He would not walk again unless the family entreated the Machine Empress for a new device specifically crafted to help him. All knew that she was busy with the new alliance and the building of something grand, but I was given the task of traveling to the Yellow Palace nonetheless.
 
With a smile from his bed, my father told me it was my first task as an adult. The rest of the family was cold, shocked and grieving as they were, and the others at the enclave did not even say goodbye. I suspected I'd been quietly banished for being too much of a problem, and my father was the only person not in the know.
 
I had no money, but the world was changing for the better every year. Food was freely available for the hungry in every town, and I lurked in the fields between portal jumps across the land. I arrived at the Yellow Palace after a few days only to find that Her Glory was not in; a local priest told me that she would be at various *knigspfalz* as she traveled around the world setting up the Grand Project.
 
I tracked these for a time, based on hearsay and rumor, but the far better route would have been to return home and consult with my mother's people. Their connections might have given us more direct access. I couldn't do that, though, for I still held within me bitterness and rebellion. I turned thirteen alone, and celebrated by skipping stones along a creek outside a city called Kyoto in a realm marginally outside of Her Glory's direct rule.
 
I liked the people in that country. Being Germanic by human descent, I was already a foreigner, so they treated me no differently than any other stranger. In fact, I had fallen in with another exile like myself, a man named Yoritomo, as a sort of servant or brother in a way that I didn't quite understand. Like my mother, I could pick most of their language from their heads, but that didn't mean I knew their culture.
 
I was happy for any semblance of friendship, though, so I portaled him and several of his friends from the Kanto Plains to Kyoto to celebrate my birthdaybut they found an excuse to run off almost immediately, and I soon saw a great blaze rise up from the city. The palace was destroyed that day, and I realized I'd been used. He'd always had plans to return to Kyoto, and I'd been just a pawn. I began to see his womanizing ways for what they were, too, so I told Ito Sukechika, his jailer in exile, that Yoritomo had been having a secret affair with his daughter. Ito was furious, and I knew there would be a great disturbance. In truth, it felt good to strike back at the cruelty of the world around me. After that small act of vengeance, I ran.
 
That sense of striking back faded, but I continued to seek it. The world was enormous and full of people of infinitely different cultures, but I fit into none. The only possessions I carried were my knife, my clothes, and the new name I'd chosen for myselfWecelo, for no other reason than that I liked the sound. As my father had said, I was slowly becoming the person I wanted to be, and that person was strong, confident, and a little bit of a braggart. From city to city and culture to culture, I would infiltrate the outcasts, thieves, and rebellious young adults and live high for as long as I could before skipping town in my own unique way that baffled authorities.
 
The ability to sense people and intents was almost as useful as the ability to portal into secure places. I learned to adapt to whosoever surrounded me, and, by the time I turned fourteen, I had a little enclave of my own. These were children ages six to twelve who were starving outside Oraibi, a pueblo city standing just about as far away from my home as possible. Her Glory's free food had not reached this continent to any great degree, and my kids were from the wrong tribe for this region. That made me care greatly for them, and I began to truly *steal* for the first time.
 
It was exhilarating. Wealthy lords had foodand then I had that food, and they no longer did. My thievery baffled them. At one point, the greatest merchant of Oraibi sealed a feast inside a stone room with no windows and no doors, and, that night, the feast appeared in the public commons for all to consume. I listened to that tale with a great grin; the people secretly cheered this equalizer of fortunes, this unknown thief some hailed as a creature of spirit. They had no idea that they were right.
 
The trick to getting away with theft, though, is *not telling anybody.* This was difficult for me at fourteen, because local girls of Oraibiand possibly everywhereresponded to such acts of skill and daring with great interest. With them, I was caught right up again in loathing for my strange body and ugly face, and I was also as confused as any fourteen year old with no adults to consult might have been. Inevitably, any girl that got close to the mysterious Wecelo the Foreigner soon left confused, disappointed, or offended. Worse, some told the Oraibi enforcers, and I had to run yet again. I'd trained my kids well, and I knew they'd survive, but the loss was yet another bitter spiked agony bouncing around in my chest with all the others.
 
Something pulled me toward home, but first I went to Rome. The ancient streets that held the history of the world somehow comforted me. All of these people whose easy happiness with each other so tortured methey would one day die and be forgotten, just like so many before them, just like me. This pain that so consumed my heart would be fleeting in the face of existence and history.
 
The call was going out at that time. Postings had been nailed to public doors, signs had been put up, and heralds were proclaiming every hour on the hour: the Grand Project needed volunteers. This was a summons to the bravest souls across the globe, for the task meant giving up one's mortal coil and living in service for a hundred years. Eighteen were needed.
 
I slunk among a group of ruffians with ease, but even we couldn't help but get caught up in the frenzy. It was actually happening! With these eighteen volunteers, and another eighteen from rumored distant allies, the walls of existence would be ours to command. Everyone gets a world, they said, and each of us vagabonds wondered what we might do with our own Earth. We attended that month's public spectacle and watched as Rome produced an actual volunteer. The young man walked meekly up onto forum dais and waved. He was number eleven of eighteen.
 
He seemed nice enough. I couldn't imagine volunteering for a hundred years of pure service. That was ten times longer than I could even remember being alive. A girl came up with him, too, and I knew that he was loved. How could he give that up? If I had a single person who loved me, I would do anything to hold on to that.
 
Unless she was volunteering, too? Now that would be a devotion of the kind I'd only dreamed about.
 
As I considered these thoughts, I cut purses full of coins from the crowd. I didn't need money, but I did need distraction, or I would cry at the prospect of all the meaning and family I would never have.
 
My mother's people were nearby, and I sensed them as they sensed me. I knew, in that instant, who the distant allies of the Grand Project were. I found a back alley and portaled away, but one man followed me with a portal of his own. "Stop!" he shouted, leaping into world after world behind me. "I'm your uncle, fool child!"
 
I didn't believe him, and I didn't want to hear what he had to say. I had no doubt he would tell all sorts of lies about how much my family missed me. I would fall for them, and I would go back, and I would be trapped in that self I hated and had left behind. I sought to leap as far from him as I could, somewhere so distant he could never follow. My mother's people had a limit to their range through the bubbles of existence, one based on safety, but I was three-quarters human, and a teenager besides. I cast my destination recklessly into the seething ocean of the worlds.
 
He didn't followbut I almost wished he had.
 
Immediately, instinctively, I knew to be quiet. This was an ancient and hallowed place for unknown ken beyond imagining. Dark blue roiling marble formed smooth jagged halls of a titanic scale that spiraled fractally out in every direction, and I mean *every* direction. A full human might have been driven insane; as it was, I stumbled along with more than just my eyes. I was far from the worlds of mankind, the same as leaping from Tokyo to Oraibi for a normal human bound to travel only by foot. Everything I knew was an unswimmable ocean away, and I remembered a vague warning from my mother about sticking to our base wellspring of realities.
 
I'd gone too far. This was somewhere else, some*thing* else, not just different branches on the same tree, but a different tree, *a different forest entirely.* Shadowed eaves of marble ran with intricate patterns carved by no hand; dark doorways led to differing realms of physics and interplay beyond understanding. Through it all, a great wind moved past me at intervals of a few minutes, then back in the opposite direction in an alternating pattern.
 
It was breath. I knew after the second reversal. Some great entity slept here, dreaming a small bubble in which I could exist. If I had landed anywhere else, in any of these worlds past these shadow-doors
 
Creeping up in a spiral around, upside down, and back again, I quietly entered a chamber where a frail humanoid figure lay sleeping. It was her breath that filled these carved caverns. Despite her apparent size, I knew that what I was seeing was not strictly what it appeared to be. She looked to be a few years older than me, with long hair, anda face like mine. This place was full of reflections of awareness and thought. I doubted this entity was even remotely human.
 
Clutched between her folded hands was a gold-and-platinum-bound book.
 
Was sleeping still sleeping in this place? I believed that it was. The urge to steal something so magnificent and exotic was irresistible. Ever so cautiously, I reached out and slid the tome bit by bit out of the entity's folded hands.
 
And then I woke up, limp and weak, in the arms of my uncle. He was breathing hard and his skin was still steaming from braving worlds exotic and unknown, but he'd survived, and rescued me besides. He took me home to London where I recuperated in a bed beside my father's, for I, too, had lost the use of my limbs. For the five weeks it took to regain control of my bodyagain thanks to my quarter-spirit side, which helped me consciously regenerate in small amounts what would have been a destroyed human nervous systemI was home again, and with someone who loved me. My father and I traded stories of the last several years, and he told me he was very impressed with me, but, "Don't tell your mother what you've been doing!"
 
He grinned as I told mother I was just trying to track down the Empress for our request.
 
She didn't smile. She told me, "We tried to track you down as soon as our contacts told usnobody knows where she is. She's gone into seclusion, because a great depression has fallen over her. We sent you away on a fool's errand." She began to cry then, the first time that I had ever truly seen, and she hugged me at length. Things became positive with my family during those weeks, and I knew a momentary sense of sanctuary and caring. My brother and sister stopped by to check in on me, too, and for once neither of them made fun of me for my knife-cut short hair.
 
But I couldn't stop dreaming about that book. In that dream-like exo-reality of reflections and strange sights, a kernel of truth resided beneath every vision. I valued nothing material at all, really, but somewhere out there was a book my mind's eye saw as bound in the most precious metals. I doubted it really looked like that. No, that metaphorical value meant something else.
 
I turned fifteen surrounded by family, but dreaming of a precious prize. Id tasted the possibilities of the world, and I would never be the same. I insisted I be called by the name I had chosen, but my mother hated *Wecelo*, and demanded I go by my given name. Her anger and resentment increased with the passing of the season, and it took my fathers intervention to stave off a permanent rift. I was still wonderful and would do great things with my life, he told her, even if I wasnt the child shed hoped for. Caught between two worlds, I had to choose for myself, and she had to be at peace with my decision.

I cant describe how much his support meant to me. There were times, so full of self-loathing for so many reasons, that I might have chosen to take the honorable way out. I think he knew that his love gave me continued life. The day that I left, to give my mother space and to strike out on my ownthat was the last day I would ever talk to him. His condition stilled his heart about two weeks after I departed.

That day, he and I threw rocks out the window at pecking birds on the ground outside. Whenever we ran out of stones, I would gather more and bring them back in a pile on his bed. Then, the Avian War would continue as we talked about things important and trivial. He knew thievery made my heart beat faster, and he didnt judge; hed also heard of a book that my mothers people were whispering about. While mapping reality-spanning leylines, a survey party had wandered too far and stumbled across a mysterious book with strange powers of information.

The Eldest had recognized it immediately and suggested it be destroyed with great vehemence, but, without any further explanation, the human factions involved in the Grand Project had refused. All the Eldest would say that was that *that ghastly tool of the gwellions will one day mean the destruction of everything we accomplish here.* Hed refused to elaborate on who he was talking about or how such evil would occur.

The humans didnt understand, but my mothers people had to side with the Elder. The alliance itself was in danger of being torn apart.

Wecelo, my son, my father said, touching my face.

I smiled uncontrollably.

I give you this quest, as our familys only thief. Steal that godforsaken book and put an end to the feud.

I was the happiest child alive. I will, father.
 
And who knows, he said off-hand. Maybe keeping that thing away from us like the Elder said will do some good.

Either way, I was more than happy to go on a grand quest with my skills and make my father proud. Ill have that book inside a month, youll see.

I know. He threw a rock and hit a bird straight on, scaring it into taking squawking flight. We both laughed and jeered as it darted away, never to return. After it was gone, I felt a slight pang. The Avian War was over, and I would be leaving that night the same way.

Due to certain alliances made by the Machine Empress during her rise to power, my mother's people had strong ties to the faith. I sought out Peter de Colechurch, the priest still overseeing the construction of the same bridge Id often wet my feet by. I found him at the busy build site on the closest bank of the Thames, and he recognized me. You were such a beautiful child, how could I forget?

I glared something fierce. No need to lie. Im well aware of how ugly I am.

He raised his hands diplomatically. What do you seek, child?

Lowering my voice so as not to be heard by the nearby laborers, I told him the entire plan. I held nothing back, for he was a seal-bearer, and thus a leader of men acting in his own right. He would see right through my deceptions.

He pulled me aside, standing right at the breezy rivers edge with his hand gripping my arm, and I thought I was in trouble. Instead, he murmured, I suppose the Lord works in mysterious ways, and I suppose an act of sin done with helpful intent is forgivable. I have heard rumors of trouble among the men and angels of the Grand Project. Perhaps you are the Lords response to our collective prayers. He hesitated. Youre part angel, arent you?

A quarter, by my mothers side, I responded, surprised that he could tell.

He shrugged. Angels among us having children and grand-children. If I wasnt a man of faith, I wouldnt believe it myself. Ill get you the information you seek. Wait over there.

He walked off with purpose, leaving me to waitin a tavern! Id never actually been in one before, and it was mid-day, but the place was still stocked with a decent supply of drunkards who immediately accepted me as one of the guys. They goaded me to drink, even bought me the first round, and I overestimated myself. By the time Peter returned, I was thoroughly drunk, and in trouble with the tavern-keeper for drinking without paying.

Sighing at the follies of youth, my saviour priest flashed his seal, a medallion with a symbol of a man praying at an altar. The tavern-keeper pulled out some green wax and got that seal in writing, so to speak, and Peter dragged me outside by the ear. I thought his intent was to scold me, but instead, he whispered, The demonic book is being kept somewhere very special, where it can harm no one. It is also safe from angels there, so they say. He pressed a strange metal square into my hand and showed me certain manipulations of its components. Her Glorys work, he said with exasperation. You have no idea how much her existence has muddled the word of the Lord.

If you think were angels, I can guess, I laughed, taking the metal square and stumbling along. As I moved its tiny pieces the way hed demonstrated, I felt strange, and screamed as pink lightning arced up my arms and face. The last thing I saw before everything changed was his astounded expression.

I wasnt drunk anymore. That much I sensed immediately. I was also on a cold and blasted hillside right outside a small settlement called Moscow, somewhere in the vast wastelands of the northern end of the continent between London and Kyoto. It was winter, and my sixteenth birthday was a week away. That chip, wherever it had gone, had eaten a chunk of my life and left me empty-handed.

Thin and exhausted, I found refuge in a warm little homeless shelter run by a kind woman whose face Ill never forget. In the time that had vanished, my muscles had atrophied, my hair had grown long, and my nails had become cumbersome. She gave me a bath and trimmed hair and nails both. How long had I been gone?

The answer came to me in dreams, a little bit each night, as my angel heritage began to recall what had happened in a nightmare world of pink and cyan. Thered been men and angels both, and a great many of them at that, building countless structures and systems with Her Glorys technology. Without the ability to portal away, Id been caught, and kept imprisoned for a time until Id mastered the strange manner of that exo-reality. They didnt know Id navigated one before, that horrible shadowed world of dark blue dream-marble, and I slipped away by pure thought once I realized it was possible.

My return and theft had been carefully planned and calculated for the better part of a year. They hadnt forgotten about me, but it was impossible to be diligent at all times, and they had no idea what I was after besides. Id grabbed the book from its caretaker, and then

I had it. It was with me, even then. It had been since the moment Id returned. Waking with a start and covered in sweat, I found it already in my hands. As Id guessed, it was not actually bound in gold and platinum. It was plain, brown, and leathered. That struck me as proof that it was valuable: most books *screamed* to be read, but this book wanted to be unobtrusive and ignored.

It was late and dark, and the others were asleep. The wind howled outside with the fury of the northern reaches; we were not much farther north than my home in London, but the air here came from the far corners of the world. That was the moment my life would change forever. Information powers, my father had saidwhat then, to ask this book?

What else would a near-sixteen-year old wondering about the future ask? I whispered, Tell me about the most important thing Ill ever do. I opened it to the first page.

---

Edgar read the first sentence without realizing what it meant. Then, he narrowed his eyes. The situation dawned upon him like an echo out of time. Holy shit.

What is it? Neil asked, leaning over his shoulder. As he read, he exclaimed, No way!

Cantey called over from his lookout post at the door: Whats happening?

Its showing *us!* Edgar shouted. Our words and actions are *in the book!*

Right there on the page, paragraphs began appearing in real time, and the book began to warm in his hands.

Who are you? Wecelo asked.

Neil stared. Can he hear us? Is he saying that now in response to us?

No, he couldnt be. Were reading what happened over eight hundred years ago.

Taken aback, Wecelo demanded of the pages before him, Eight hundred years? Who is this *rascaille*?

The translations changed somehow, too, Edgar commented. There must be an additional perspective in play now, not just our own. Are the booksthe book now and the book thenlinked somehow? How is this possible?

Answer me!

Edgar hesitated. Wecelo?

Yes.

Wow! Its true!

Neil scooted forward to get a better angle on the book while he held his daughter tight. Wecelo? You can hear us?

No, but I can read your words. Who and where are you?

The two men looked at each other for a moment, but Neil took the lead. Hi, Wecelo. Were in 2016 AD.

*Cnafa.* Wecelo paused. Wait, I see it did not translate. Um, liar.

No, its not a lie, Neil said truthfully. See? Look, it says its true!

So it does.

What year are you in? Its 1177 or something, right? And youre in Moscow?

Wecelo looked around for unseen observers, but there were none to be found. No, its 1180, but how do you know where I am? The insight was obvious when he thought about it. Youve been reading about my life!

Edgar cut in with a sheepish frown. We have, Im sorry. This book speaks to your soul directly, but please dont feel invaded. Your exploits are very important to us, and the weapons and technology youve left behindsorry, *will* leave behindare critical for saving the human race here in 2016.

Eight hundred and thirty six years, Wecelo murmured. I knew we would all one day be dead and our pains would vanish from our mortal coils, but this is overdoing it. He thought a bit deeper. But wait, I havent stolen any weapons or technology.

You will, Edgar said, giving a small quiet laugh. Right now, to us, youre probably the most important man who has ever lived.

Man? Wecelo asked, holding up his scrawny arms to look at them in awe. Is that how Im remembered? And Im only sixteen It was his turn to laugh. But Ill be older with each passing day, wont I? And youre eight hundred years away. To you, Ive been dead for ten times longer than I could possibly live.

Neil sighed. "I'm sorry. We're actually at your tomb."

A slow moment of vague pain stilled Wecelo. He sat and thought about what the presence of strangers at his tomb meant, deep enough in thought to miss the coming attack.

"What? Look out!" Edgar shouted.

Reading the warning, Wecelo rolled to the side just in time to avoid a club to the head. His motion closed the strange book.

I fought the other vagabonds off the best I could, but my escape came in the form of a flight into the freezing winter night with just enough wherewithal to grab the book. Falling in the snow about a mile distant into the black, I rubbed a small bit of ice against my black eye and nursed my bruised ribs. I tried to make a portal, but I was too hurt and angry to summon up the strength. I was still a quarter-inhuman, though; I would probably survive the night. I rolled weakly and opened the book. "Are you there?"

They were.

Crying was for girls, and I usually tried my hardest to avoid it, but I didn't like someone seeing this. "I just make people uncomfortable," I said, answering their question. "No, this isn't the first time." I hesitated before continuing. "The truth is, this happens a lot, and almost anywhere I go. I guess my soul just didn't want you to know about it, because I'm ashamed." 

"So this book extracts the truth as the soul sees it, as the soul wants it to be," Edgar mused. "I think that explains some things."

Breathing hard against the bone-pain in my torso, I gasped, "So, are you talking to my soul at the end of my life?"

"We're at your tomb, so I think we are, yes."

"But I'm reading your words and actions while I'm only sixteen." I stared up at the stars, imagining the infinite empty cold between myself and those beacons of heat and light. "Is that how itor youknew I was about to get hit in the head?"

"I think so."

"But I didn't get hit in the head. Are you going to change the course of my life by telling me things?"

Neil leaned closer to the book. "It didn't strictly say you were going to get hit. It said there was a coming attack."

"It's still a good question," Edgar said, grinning unconsciously. "I love this kind of thing. We should figure out which type of time communication this is. Pre-destined, variable, or other."

Recovering somewhat from the pain, I packed some snow into a makeshift shelter over the course of an hour, and then asked, "What do you have in mind?"

"A technological disruption could cause the most positive benefit, especially something that's not a weapon and can't be misused." Edgar suggested. "We should tell you how to build cell phones."

I narrowed my eyes at the book. "We have cell phones."

"What? Aren't you in 1180 AD?"

"I've got a cell phone right here. I could call me mum right now if I wanted."

"He's a Londoner alright," Neil said to his companion. "This is super weird. The style of the text changes based on who's reading *and* who's speaking, doesn't it?"

Edgar nodded. "For sure. But where'd you get a cell phone, Wecelo?"

"Uh, Her Glory invented those like a century ago."

Both future men paused.

"Cars?" Edgar asked.

I nodded. "Yup."

"Shit, that's right. Verene's tale of"

My heart leapt into my throat. "You know Verene?"

"Yeswait, do you?"
 
It didn't seem possible. "She's my grandmother."

Edgar looked up and to his right. "I thought that statue looked like her. She did mention having four children with a Brownshirt wanderer."

How did they know so much? "My grandfather."

"I guess I never really thought about the true depth of what that meant. She sort of glossed over any discussion of it. So that means there were half-Brownshirts"

"And quarter," I added.

"running around eight hundred years ago. Was she the only one who married cross-culture?"

"No. But how is my grandmother still alive in your time?"

"Something Her Glory did to her." Edgar changed his tone to one of introspection. "This is too high a level of coincidence for comfort. We met and traveled with your grandmother when all this began, and now we're talking to you eight hundred years in the past."

"I haven't seen her in years, but I can send her a missive to meet you at that specific time and place if it eases your fear of coincidence." I flashed a teasing grin at the book and watched as my expression turned into words.

Unannounced, Cantey slid up, leaned over to study the text, and jibed, "You two flirting, are you?"

"Seriously?" Edgar and I said at the same time, both mildly annoyed.

"Fine." The young man moved back to his post by the church entrance. "No sense of humor around here. Guess that'll happen when the world's going to be destroyed every other week."

Neil spoke up. "Edgar, you've met Verene?"

Edgar straightened his sitting position. "Have you?"

"Yeah. I didn't think to mention it because it was so brief. On the long walk, she pointed us to the farm reality where I eventually became lead engineer."

"This is beyond coincidence now," Edgar said. He turned to shout to Cantey. "You ever met a white-skinned woman with jade body armor?"

The young man turned back slowly. "Yes how the hell did you know that?" He turned as pale as the woman in question. "Alek Staley sent her back to help the rest of us find the sanctuary worlds behind your Shield. When she heard my name, she"

"told you to volunteer for this mission someday," Edgar said simultaneously. "And I imagine Mashburn and Showman have similar stories."

"I asked Showman to come," Neil said, worried. "Are we in danger?"

"I'm not sure. One thing's clearwe were meant to be here, now."

 Perhaps there is a story in what is surely a sinister conspiracy.

I'm actually not sure. They seem to have a high rate of turnover with their moderators, and they've got a pretty strict format. I also push the envelope on new things in horror all the time, so I think it's pretty natural.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unlike in stories, mysterious events cause anger and confusion rather than terror when they happen for real. I became obsessed with the events at my old apartment building for a while as I tried to piece together some explanation, but, as I reach a full year since my departure, I have to accept that I will never get closure. Posting them here is my way of releasing them into the world to become someone else's problem.

Our nickname for the building in question was the Old. It was a 1920's construct populated by a distinct mix of young college students and older couples who were mainly without children. There were five students other than myself on the top floor, and about thirty adult residents on the lower floors - so we literally called the building "the Old" as our way of recognizing that we felt out of place passing grey-haired working men in the stairwell.

They didn't like us much, either, so we tended to suffer the symptoms of the aging building without complaint. Early last December, the building's furnace broke down. It stayed off for nearly a week as the temperatures in our room dropped to freezing levels. We couldn't fathom how the older residents simply ignored the problem.

That week, I often walked by the massive metal door to the furnace room in the basement, reading the asbestos warning repeatedly and wondering if I should go in and try to fix it myself. I was returning from one of those moments when I came upstairs and found warm air... I checked: the furnace was still offline. At first, I said nothing, as I was just confused.

The six of us spent most of our time alone in our rooms that week studying for finals. I remember, after several hours of late night solitude, the exact moment the oddities began.

I heard the voice of Andrew, the guy across the hall, speak quite clearly. I jumped and scanned the room, but I was alone. I hadn't caught his words, but his voice came again. He said: "What do you mean?"

Perplexed, I crossed the hall and knocked on his door. He answered with a yawn and followed me to my room. He asked what the problem was, and I told him I'd heard him speak. He then said:

"What do you mean?"

His words carried the exact same tone and cadence I had heard moments earlier. I came up with an excuse and apologized for interrupting his studies. He shrugged and left... and I decided to cut down on the caffeine.

The next afternoon, I ran into him in the hall. He asked me if I talked in my sleep, and I laughed and asked why. He shook his head and looked confused, but didn't explain. He returned to his room while I headed down the stairwell... and the subsequent incident caused me to start keeping a journal of the strange events.

As usual, I got stuck behind a slow walker in the stairwell. He wore a suit and was obviously some sort of corporate man, his grey hair belying many years of toil. I'd seen him before. As with most of the residents, he didn't like us very much. I accidentally sighed at being stuck behind him... and he turned, giving me a look of animosity and disbelief that was oddly directed at my arm. He turned back around, muttered something, and resumed his descent at a slightly faster speed. I decided to apologize to him.

"Excuse me..."

The old man froze for a moment without looking back. I began to speak again, but he took off at a surprising speed and slammed out of the Old's front door. By the time I got to its small window and looked out, he was nowhere in sight.

As I thought back on my polite but distant interactions with the other older people in the building, I realized that a pallor of fear had been hanging over them for the last several days. They had all seemed... afraid of us, for some reason.

Each day, the Old grew warmer.

I had relished the ability to forego sweaters while studying, but, by the weekend, I was down to undershirts and verging on uncomfortable - and, still, the furnace was silent.

I began to hear snippets of conversation and music at random intervals. I'd never had a problem hearing other rooms before, but now I was subject to bits of old-fashioned music, overly loud conversations, and - on one particularly maddening occasion - somebody's snoring. All of this seemed to originate from somewhere inside my room, though I could never pinpoint where.

For his part, Andrew seemed gaunt and tired. He chalked it up to studying too hard, but he seemed to be nervous about something. I hadn't seen the other four college students in days. That Sunday night, I cornered Andrew. I told him about what I was experiencing, and asked him if he'd seen or heard anything. He mumbled a single phrase before retreating to his room:

"Bad dreams..."

It left me with a chill I couldn't explain. I tried to get down to it and focus on studying for the finals that were coming up over the coming week, but the building's creaking seemed more pronounced. The Old seemed to shift with the icy winter wind, which I took advantage of through an open window. By then, the hallways were practically a sauna.

At some point, I'd had enough. I was more angry than afraid, and I decided to start asking some questions. I'd left more than a few notes under the maintenance man's door on the first floor. My first plan was to knock on his door and get some answers. As my hand pressed against the door, it swung open.

There was nothing but a brick closet beyond.

Confused, I touched the old brick, smearing soot on my fingers. I even rubbed some on my journal later to keep evidence that I wasn't imagining it - and, next to my feet, I found my last letter on a pile of paper remnants. I remember staring at the pile, realizing that the other letters had not been burned - they'd merely decomposed.

I resolved to get the hell out of the Old until I figured out what was going on, but the three feet of snow outside stopped me. I had no place to go. No real money. I could sit at a Starbucks all day, but I'd eventually have to sleep in my own bed... and I wanted to have all the evidence I could gather.

I didn't have much longer, though. I spent an hour or two knocking on the doors of the other residents, but I got nothing but confusion and anger. The older residents all refused to look at me directly in the same strange manner. They seemed overly distressed every time I spoke. I gave up, more confused than ever, and knocked on the doors of the other students, but none answered. Andrew only shouted through his door, telling me to leave him alone. Miffed, I went to bed, sweating even with the window open. I awoke to the final event, the one which compelled me to leave the Old at any cost.

I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling in the heated darkness. The shadows seemed to swirl in an odd manner, and I found myself focusing my sight to try to catch them. I played that strange game for a few moments, until I heard a woman scream.

It was a scream of pure terror, as if she was desperate to escape something that had cornered her. Worst of all, it seemed to come from inside my room. It sounded again, and then a third time.

I immediately leapt up and circled the walls of my room, trying to avoid the continual terrified screaming that was loud enough to hurt my ears. I couldn't understand what the hell was going on - the spot kept moving toward me, and I stumbled in my haste to avoid the slowly approaching source of the wailing screams. I heard doors slam in the hallway; other people had to have heard. I ran for them.

In the hall, I fell and scraped my hands in response to an overwhelming wave of heat. It felt like I'd stepped into a furnace - and the dark hallway seemed empty. Where were the people I'd heard? And still, that godforsaken screaming rang out from behind my hastily closed door. I could hear it getting closer to the other side of the wood, and I backed away in horror. My back touched Andrew's door...

...and another voice, this one male, began shouting from behind his door. I couldn't tell if it was him, but I could hear him screaming for God and salvation and crying as his door shuddered with several impacts, as if someone on the other side was desperate to escape. I was forced to cover my ears to stop the pain from those two voices screaming at the top of their lungs...

... and another screaming voice joined them, this one from a distant room at the end of the hallway. A fourth, one long roar of agony and pain, echoed from another floor.

I ran.

I vaulted down the stairwell, a smoky bitterness stinging my eyes and a furnace heat rushing around me. A choir of screaming voices, hundreds for all I knew, screamed and shouted and begged with the utmost imaginable human terror and agony. I pushed at the heavy front door, but it refused to budge. It seared my hands, and I fell to the floor, near to crying. I was at my wit's end.

Then I looked up, and saw the little square window set in the door. I slowly stood, hands pressed to my ears in a futile attempt to block out the endless screams. Some wordless intuition warned me not to look through that window. A dark light sheared through it in a distinct glow that alternated green and blue. I put my hand up against the door just as I was about to look...

...and I stumbled out the front door into snow, directly into the arms of a police officer.

Two police cars radiated red and blue nearby in the silent chill. I saw Andrew leaning against one of the cars, his arms curled against the cold. He seemed... worn. I looked up at the Old, expecting to see smoke or fire. I saw nothing.

The officer I'd run into asked me several vague questions before explaining Andrew had called them over a 'noise disturbance.' He asked if 'the kid was a druggy', but I shook my head. He looked me over, probably noting my sweat and confused look, and asked me if I was one. I told him that, no, I was just studying and sick from too much caffeine and sleep deprivation. He laughed, and let me go.

I figured I'd had a mental break... I was going to head straight for the school library and I was determined to stay and make calls until I got things straightened out. The cop asked me one last question as I walked away.

"You see any of them?"

I turned back to him, folding my arms close against the cold.

"Who?"

"The kids."

I narrowed my eyes.

"What kids?"

He gave me a strange look.

"The ones that did all that screaming."

I shook my head, faking calm, and hurried away from the Old without a single look back.

In later conversations with the building's owner, I learned that he'd only rented it to college students, and only on the top floor. The rest of the floors were unlivable - he didn't elaborate. I told him that we'd passed other residents every single day, but he insisted they must have been squatters. According to him, the only tenants were myself, Andrew, and two other students. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Question is. Do you ever wonder if you get these ideas because somewhere somewhen they really are, will or have happened?

Absolutely! I fully believe that if the universe is as complex and infinite as it seems it might be, these events have actually happened somewhere. That's the beauty of infinity. When writing, I often feel that I'm simply discovering places and times that already exist, and I can actually feel it when the story's not following correctly. Sometimes it makes me wish I could simply force a happy ending, but life rarely turns out that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Have you ever read The Santaroga Barrier by Frank Herbert? You might get a kick out of it.

Actually, I have! Fantastic tale that actually partially inspired one of my earliest stories (specifically the 'ad resistance' of the town). My story hasn't been posted anywhere, I don't think, and I'd have to go digging for it - but it was about the self-limiting evolution of the modern human brain - we couldn't expand our awareness because we're surrounded by millions of ads, so instead we were getting more oblivious and daydreamy, and by the time the main character (a scientist) realized it was happening, nobody cared. Eerie similarities to modern outrages and how nothing is done to actually solve anything. </TEXT>
