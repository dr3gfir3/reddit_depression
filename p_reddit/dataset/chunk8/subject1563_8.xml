	<TEXT> There was a time I thought she would evolve as a writer, her first book was mildly impressive considering her age. But I don't care what anyone says, her looks did help it a lot (not saying because she was a woman, a handsome man would do the same, but the world is how it is unfortunately) but then the following 2 were unimpressive.

She tried to be a bit more experimental but then that showed her real limitations. Now it seems like back to more of the same. I'll library it but I'd be hard pushed to spend money on her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. This point goes over the head of everyone who knocks out some cheap aphorism about new jobs and new markets. That was the past. It does not apply.

No, never before has this happened, the new jobs will largely be those that will be unattainable for many due to natural intelligence. And for most will probably require a whole rethinking of how we educate which could take a generation or more. </TEXT>
