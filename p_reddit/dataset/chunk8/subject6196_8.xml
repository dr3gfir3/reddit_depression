	<TEXT> Yeah, that's what /u/muddlesthrough was originally saying: beginners *are* duffing and blading chips. It's nuts out there. I play as a single a lot, and get matched up with lots of guys who can hit off the tee fine, and their mid-range shots are serviceable, but then around the green they fall apart. 

Among beginners, it's rare to see guys with good chipping feel. The number of shots bladed across the green is staggering every time I play. Not to mention that when they do get up on the green, their chip shot was so bad it left them with a 60+ foot putt and a likely 3-putt.  </TEXT>

And he did follow procedure: the head of the House Ethics Committee sent a formal letter to Comey inquiring on the status of a case, and Comey followed procedure by responding. 

It sucks that this was then used as ammo by the GOP against Clinton, but the blame is squarely on Chaffetz, not Comey.  </TEXT>

**EDIT**: just to elaborate on this, I think most average/good golfers take for granted how difficult chipping around the green is. It's incredibly hard. A few months ago bad chipping was easily responsible for 7-10 strokes on every round I played, and is still that way for the buddies I play with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  there's not much difference from great scrambling and serviceable scrambling on the courses most amateurs play.

Uhhh

I just started playing last August, and there's an enormous difference. Beginners are always *around* the green without being on it. Chipping is ridiculously important for a beginner, arguably moreso than for someone more skilled.

Chipping is also awfully hard (for a beginner). 10 yards from the green with a bunker in the way? Better to take two shots to go *around* the bunker than try going over it. Ball on the slop of a raised green? Yeah, either I'm going to hit it short and have it roll all the way down, or I'm going to hit it 10 yards over the green and have to do it all over against from the other side.

Maybe I have a unique perspective because I just started playing a few months ago, but chipping is one of the most important things for a beginner to practice, and it's the single biggest thing that improved my game from shooting 110 to the low 90s.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> +1 for this. I like to keep score, focusing on how many shots over GIR I am on each "hole". So I'll pretend the first hole is a Par 4 and use my driver. If I nail it straight and long then I'll use a 9 or 8 iron on my second shot and aim for the shorter flag on the range. If my drive was off then I'll use my 5-6-7 irons and aim for a longer flag. If I miss, then I chip next, aiming for somewhere in front of me on the range.

If this is your experience then you probably have a gambling-like problem. I say that without any malice, but if you're taking profits on a small amount and that's making it difficult to sleep then maybe you should seek counseling?

	<TEXT> When one thing is injured, you're more likely to overcompensate in other areas. 

This sort of thing is classic in running injuries: your right knee starts bothering you, so you favor your left leg just a liiiiiiiiiiiiiiittle bit more, and then end up injuring your left leg as a result. </TEXT>

A) The Trump team has been distancing themselves from Flynn for the past few weeks.
