Hey guys, this is Finn, Alexs friend. Well More like acquaintance. We met as she was leaving Dryston, and I was on my way out as well. We decided to join forces for good and find a hotel for a while, or at least until we get all this shit sorted out.

Im aware that she hasnt mentioned me before, and thats coolio, but its also sorta disheartening. I mean, I get shes gay, but shes also pretty damn hot. Oh well.

She said she wasnt posting tonight, too worn out from the other ones, so I guess Ill take this one. You guys probably want another one, anyway.

Lessgo.

~~

I was born in Dryston. It was all I ever knew. The lights came on at night? Fuckin... whatever, man. Its normal. To me, it was, anyway.

Until it wasnt.

See, my Dad worked at the cannery. My Mom worked at the cannery. I was going to work at the cannery. But sometimes things dont really work out like that, you know? Im out of Dryston, rooming with a seriously fucked up lesbian, and just generally trying to figure everything out. Her history is not nearly as clear cut as mine.

One day, my Dad came home shouting. He told me to grab all my shit, put it in the car, and drive. He started screaming about the Notres Passings (something Im sure youre well familiar with by now), and then he was gone. I mean, I know he didnt just disappear, but I forget what happened. Something came and ripped him out of the window, and I remember *seeing* it, I just dont remember what it looked like. Tell me if that makes sense.

I guess, if I had to compare it to something, itd be like the Silence from Doctor Who. You can look at them, and as long as youre looking at them you know exactly what they are, but as soon as you look away you completely forget. 

Id like to say that I turned the car around and helped my Dad, but whatever had him had him. I knew I couldnt help. I knew I couldnt go back there. A thought intruded my brain that I wasnt prepared for: *You cant go there, theres no trespassing*.  Subtle, right? 

Anyway.

I continued driving until his screams died off, and kept driving still. I had to get gas at some point, though, and thats when I met Alex.

She told me that I shouldnt go back into town. Said shed released something evil, something that wasnt supposed to exist.

But, spoilers or something. She seems to have a plan for all of this, and I dont want to intrude on that.

Both of us heard the sound of glass shattering from town, despite being quite a ways away at that point. Whatever had broken had been huge. I took the pump out of my car, got in, and turned it on. Lexi (a name that infuriates her. Seriously, comment it as much as you can. Itll crack me up) followed suit.

She shouted out her window for me to follow her, and I decided to do as she said. Girls only 52 and intimidates the hell out of me. 

We drove until morning, and for the first time in my life I realized that the lights were only in Dryston. I honestly thought that every town had them. Alex explained that, no, theyre fucking weird and evil-- Id probably do without the constant brainwashing.

I immediately agreed without thinking. Funny how things work out.

When we got to the hotel, she dragged me into our room and slammed the door behind us.

So, what happened to you?

Im not going to repeat her cliche of saying I was confused, I simply refuse.

I was perplexed.

You left Dryston. Nobody leaves Dryston.

What about all those people a couple years ago?

Missing or dead. I cant believe people actually believed the cops excuse.

Yeah, despite what you read, shes actually really blunt in real life. She spices up her writing, sure, but in real life shes super direct.

And mean.

She then proceeded to tell me everything that had happened to her in Dryston. I knew she was leaving some things out (including Isabelle), but I didnt want to bug her about it so I just said goodnight and went to bed.

When I woke up she was hunched over her laptop.

Whatre you doing?

She didnt look over at me when she responded.

Uh Im just trying to find someplace where I can post my story. I need to find someplace where people can give me advice, and not actually have to worry about believing it.

She searched like that for two months, until she found Reddit and then subsequently NoSleep. She said it was perfect, and that shed begin posting as soon as she could. I warned her to try and keep her identity and gender private, but she just sorta threw that out the door in [Part 3](https://redd.it/5ofqba), which I guess is for the best.

Mostly because you guys can draw fanart now. Yes, thats an invitation.

Anyway, for the past week shes been smiling. Actually *smiling*. You guys really helped her out, and I thank you for that. I cant begin to understand what shes been through, but the fact that she can smile now is a great relief.

Tonight, the lights couldnt possibly shine brighter than her smile.

---

So, Alex just called me. She said that she was thinking, once this series is done, shell publish it as a book. That is, if anybody is interested in it. Any takers?

-Finley

#UPDATE

---

Guess whos back? Its me, Alex. *NOT* Lexi. Because that isnt my name. God, I fucking hate Finn. So, in the last post he mentioned that Im thinking of turning this into a book. This is true. Ive always sorta dreamed of publishing my own book, and Isabelle really wanted me to be a writer, so I think thatd be cool.

Obviously, only if you guys are interested in that. 

This one takes place during the beginning of Sophomore year in Dryston, a couple months ago.

Lets get on into this.

~~

In the lunch line at school, we had a couple options. There was fruit, vegetables, and meat. Straight off the line from the cannery. They didnt just can fish, there. They had beef, chicken, and turkey. And probably horse. Who knows?

Well, I wasnt a vegetarian at the time (I am now), so I chose one of the meatball subs during lunch. At this point, I didnt have many friends. People thought I was too damaged, or some shit. I mean, I saw the looks they gave me, but I just didnt care. I had fun by myself, anyway.

So when a guy sat across from me, I was surprised. I looked up to him, and saw that he was a Dryston employee. I mustve given him some look, because he began to explain what he was doing.

Im from the cannery, conducting a survey on our meat. So, finish up and then tell me what you think of it.

I finished, and told him what I thought of it. He seemed pleased with my response, and wandered off.  When I looked down at my tray, I found specks of blue in the cardboard container that had held the sub just seconds before.

Thoroughly creeped out, I went to dump my tray and put it up. The cardboard sub container stuck to the tray, so I had to sort of flick it off. I was really grossed out, and wanted to touch it as little as possible.

In the corner of my eye, I spotted a glint. Looking back into the trashcan, I saw dozens of Dryston cans lining the bottom of the bin, some with specks of blue along the openings.

I jetted myself up the stairs, and turned into the hallway. I turned around to see everybody in the cafeteria eating their subs, unaware of the Nightglow hidden inside of it. I thought back to Project Mermaid, wondering if this had anything to do with it. 

The file had mentioned bits and pieces about Nightglow, but there definitely wasnt anything super serious about it. In fact, the files mostly talked about Nightglow as it existed in the water. At this point, I had a pretty basic understanding of algae, and I had finally started to put the pieces together.

The people going missing, the Nightglow, the *lights*... How did it all fit? I knew, on a base level, that it was all part of a bigger picture. What exactly they were doing, however, I didnt yet know and I wouldnt know for a few weeks longer.

---

All right guys. I feel super shitty right now-- for one, I havent updated in 12,000 years and this update is incredibly short. I promise you I have a reason for this.

I think Ive been followed.

Finn and I have been in the same hotel for the past month and a half, and it seems like the DPD is catching up with us. Weve been hearing people talking outside our hotel room (asking if anybody matching our descriptions had been seen, if they knew anything about the recent news reports, shit like that), and decided to move again. Weve been hopping from motel to motel (all of which have the spottiest wifi ever), and weve found our way into the Crossroads of America; Indiana. Not gonna say where exactly in Indiana we are, or even what kinda building were staying in (hotel, motel, house).

I will say that this place is both incredibly shitty and incredibly kind to us. Small place, big town, very few people who would snitch on us to the cops. That said, unless theyve been reading these posts, I doubt theyd think to look in Indiana. 

Lets hope they dont find us again.

I promised you guys an explanation, and that one isnt the best one ever. Ill try to give you guys a better one soon, but for now thats the best Ive got.

Have a good night,

-Alex

This update takes place a couple days after [part 2](https://redd.it/5o8hvu), with Cass still alive and Isabelle still my sworn enemy. She never shows up in this chapter, but I still thought a reminder was due.

 nbsp;

*This chapter is dedicated to my Mother, who despite her beliefs tried her best to love me.*

*I miss you so, so much, Mom. I hope youre happy, wherever you are.*

 nbsp;

~~

Cass and I were at Nightglow Beach. Me, with the lockbox we had found two days prior. Him, with a ham and cheese sandwich. Even though I recognized it and knew what was inside, Cass did not. I elected not to tell him anything, for the sake of his excitement.

He was certainly *excited* to scarf down his fucking sandwich.

Anyway.

I slowly untied the bindings that had kept it together these past three-almost-four years, and popped open the lid. Inside was a jar of Nightglow, and an iPod Touch that looked brand new.

But, like, from Craigslist. It was pretty fuckin busted, is my point.

I stuffed it into my pocket and lifted the jar out of the box. For a moment, all the Nightglow inside seemed to shift to my side of the jar. I know it didnt *actually* happen, but it looked like it had taken the form of an eye staring at me. As soon as I saw it, though, it was gone.

Shrugging it off as an illusion, I walked the jar over to the water to get the sand off of it. As I did, I noticed something strange. All of the Nightglow in the water began to glow brighter, and move toward the jar. I quickly attempted to pull the jar out of the water, thoroughly creeped out, but something wasnt letting me. 

I looked at the other side of the jar and saw that some of the Nightglow was sticking to it, forming a rope to the water. I tugged again and the jar came loose, letting the dense Nightglow become soft again and fall back into the water.

I would later think back on this, after finding out about the Dryston conspiracy and wonder

*How does the Nightglow fit into all of this?*

At that moment, however, it was too soon to wonder. Instead, I asked Cass if he had seen what had happened just an instant before.

He shrugged.

It was probably just the algaes response to having other algae nearby. Like, a survival mechanism.

Oh.

That response satisfied me for a second. Until I thought

Wait, algae?

Well, I didnt really *think* it, per se, but the message is clear enough.

Yeah. Bio-something-essence algae. Did you think it was magic or something?

To be honest, I had never given it much thought. It was just a thing that happened. The sky was blue, no need to question it-- much like how the Nightglow was pretty. No real need to investigate. At least, not at the time. I had never suspected something so beautiful could be so evil. And I wouldnt even *begin* to suspect until a year later.

---

Authors Note.

~~

Dryston is a place that keeps secrets and keeps them well. Even though Ive uncovered (what I suspect is) almost the entirety of their operation, I still have so many questions. Questions I cant even begin to answer using the only tool I have right now-- memory.

Temporary, fallible memories.

Thats why you guys are important to me. Even without my memories, you can use this story to try and help me. Give me more than just my perspective, please. I know you all have questions, but I do as well. If you guys think you *might* be connecting some of the dots, I need to know.

Lives are at stake.

---

Cass and I went back to his house, a squat little thing with huge windows and tiny rooms. Back in his bedroom (I knew I was a lesbian at the time, and so did Cass family), we examined the jar. 

I set it on his nightstand and watched as it glowed brighter the closer to the window it got. It was pretty dark out by this point, about eight, so I decided very quickly on what our next course of action was gonna be.

We were gonna go outside again.

Cass complained, of course. Said he was hungry and that we should stay at his house for just a little while longer so he could eat something.

I told him he already had a fucking sandwich, and that won him over.

Somehow.

We went out the front door, with me in the lead. I watched as the Nightglow shined brighter depending on which direction we were going, and elected to take the brightest path.

When we ran directly into the cannery fence, I got confused. I walked around the entire perimeter, but it never got brighter.

Whatever the Nightglow was leading me to was inside. I decided that Cass and I would check it out the next morning, with a shovel.

~~

The next morning, Cass and I met near the cannery. He was holding a shovel, and I was holding a vial full of the same Nightglow that was in the jar. Despite the overwhelming feeling of dread, I knew we were ready. He dug underneath the fence and told me to crawl under.

I have [said](https://redd.it/5ofqba) [before](https://redd.it/5on10u) that Im a fairly small girl. At fourteen, I was five feet even and barely weighed more than 90 pounds. That said, it was still a tight squeeze getting through. Scratched up my back pretty badly, and ruined my hoodie.

Oh well, itd have to do.

I walked up to the door and found it surprisingly unlocked. I watched the vial grow brighter as I walked into the ground level entrance of the cannery, and walk down the pristinely white hallway. The vial seemed to be leading me to a specific door. I backtracked, and read the text that the door was marked with. 

***MSTF: NO TRESPASSING.***

I shivered involuntarily.

Slowly, I opened the door, and

You guys are gonna hate me for this.

I dont remember. I remember seeing *something* and registering that it was incredibly important and kinda scary, but I have no clue what I saw that morning.

I closed the door, shaken, and heard somebody shout from down the hall.

Hey! You cant be in here!

I turned to face them and realized that they looked sorta familiar.

In, like, an I want to punch you sort of way.

He grabbed me by my hood and dragged me outside of the cannery. Cass took one look and ran to hide in the bushes. I dont blame him, I probably wouldve done the same thing.

The man spun me around and held me by my shoulders.

Alex, you cant do this. These people could easily make you disappear.

I asked him who he was.

Right, yeah. Im Isabelles Dad. You know Isabelle, right? She was in your class last year?

I have a vague recollection.

He smiled sadly at me and sent me away.

I dont remember how I got home, but when I woke up, the vial was gone.

That night, no matter how bright the lights shined, they wouldnt find the jar of Nightglow I kept in my dresser.

---

First of all, I want to give /u/atomicdog48 a shoutout for being the most supportive commenter ever. You guys are all fantastic, but they seem to legitimately feel like me getting this story out is important. Thank you for that.

Im sorry that this story might be confusing sometimes, I truly am. The sad fact is, I cant remember much. And the things that I do remember are vague and do little in the way of offering answers. I only very recently realized that something very, very wrong was happening in Dryston. I got the hell out of there and decided to try my hardest to never look back.

Sadly, looking back seems to be all Im doing lately.

Ive gone through a *lot* of shit. Ive found out things about my town and people that I doubt Ill be able to stand for much longer without substantial help.

Its hard to take down a conspiracy by yourself.

Thank you guys for being the best, and Ill try harder to remember more about Dryston.

-Alex.

Hey, guys. Just like my last post, this chapter takes place during freshman year. Its not quite as widely scoped as the last one, and it focuses more on Cass before and after Isa moved. I mentioned in my last post that I would cry about his failing health. This was not an overreaction; it was something very worthy of my tears. Yet again, I find myself writing about the worst year of my life. But if it helps me figure out my past, its worth it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp;

*This chapter is dedicated to Cass Caspian Hildritch.*

 nbsp;

 nbsp;

~~

My friend was dying. There was no way around it, no overlooking it, no hope. I visited him three times a week, at least, and told him what was going on at school. He was usually receptive, but he sometimes looked at me like I was a stranger. If you know somebody with Alzheimers or dementia, thats the best I can relate it to. But at least you know what your loved one has.

Cass was a mystery.

Hed been seen by every medical professional in the state, but nobody could figure out what was wrong with him. Whatever he had was unknown to medical science. A few journalists came by to ask him for an interview, but his parents declined. I agreed with them. He had enough on his plate, anyway.

Drystons doctors eventually decided that the only way to help him was put him on constant painkillers, in the form of an IV drip. Whatever the medicine was, it was bright blue and seemed to glitter and warp in the sunlight. I asked a doctor what it was, and he just told me it was an experimental form of morphine, for those in incredible pain. It was the only way to help him short of putting him into a coma, apparently.

It didnt sit right with me, but Cass never complained.

Cass and I were a bit different around each other at that point. Not just because I had a girlfriend, or that my girlfriend was my once sworn enemy, or even because his sickness was stressful for both of us. No, it was different because our conversations were different now.

He didnt have the energy to form full sentences anymore. So Id usually just ask him yes/no questions, or questions that could be answered with relative ease. Beyond that, Id just tell him what was going on in school-- something he seemed overwhelmingly interested in. Hed also occasionally ask me about Isa. This conversation takes place the day before she moved.

Hows Isa?

Hmm? Isa? Shes good, I guess. Today she started talking about some conspiracy with the cannery. At first, I was kinda skeptical, but she seemed pretty serious.

His eyes widened at this. Cass was always one for conspiracies, especially ones he could directly relate to.

And?

I smiled at him. This was the most excited Id seen him in months.

And apparently-- Do you remember Haunted Island? The one we got in trouble with the cops for going to?

He looked confused for a second but quickly nodded.

Cool. Okay, so, *apparently* the real reason we got in trouble for it, is because Haunted Island is an underseas biological testing site. Guess the name of the project.

Uh Ghost?

Nope! Guess again.

Ghoul?

Nope. Its called *Project Mermaid*.

He smiled at me. I smiled back-- days like these were rare with him. He opened his mouth to reply but suddenly began to drift off.

I frowned but understood that was my cue to leave. Before I left, I squeezed his hand.

Later, Caspian.

He laughed softly, before fully passing out.

---

The day after Isabelle moved away, I visited Cass once more. I told him everything that had happened-- what she had said to me, how insanely blue her eyes looked, and the door slamming when she left (I left out the part about the paint, I didnt think it was important at the time). When I told him about the door slamming, he looked at me funny.

Are you sure?

I told him that I was.

That didnt make sense to him, for some reason. I couldnt understand why, so I figured it was just his sickness, or the morphine, messing with his brain. But then he told me.

No. Alex, that doesnt make any sense.

Now it was my turn to look confused.

Why not?

I will now tell you that, at this point, his disease had progressed so much that moving in any way was both incredibly difficult and painful, regardless of the morphine. So when he sat up in his bed so we could see each other eye to eye -mine confused, his erratic- I was more than worried about what he was gonna tell me.

Because, Alex.

He paused for a long time. A worryingly long time.

What is it?

He sighed.

Every door in the school is fitted with a door closer. It wouldnt only be difficult to slam the door, itd be downright impossible. Whatever you heard, it wasnt a door.

At first, I was excited. This was the most hed said since his diagnosis! But then, his words began to set in. Slowly, everything began to make sense. The conspiracy, how scared she seemed, the fact that she said she wanted to tell me her final goodbyes, her sad smile, the way her dad hugged her Wherever she was going, she was fully aware that she was never coming back. And her dad was in on it.

Oh my God

Cass lay back down. I began to shake uncontrollably.

Wait. Then what was the sound? Oh my God! Where is Isabelle? What happened to her? Cass, I-

He held a single hand up.

I dont know, Alex. Its likely I wont ever know. Whatevers inside of me, I can feel it. Its moving around inside I think its trying to get to my brain. Whatever this disease is, its not giving me enough time to help you. Im sorry. Im so fucking sorry, Alex.

~~

The next time I came over, I found him dead in his bed. His death wasnt quick, and it certainly wasnt painless- but despite this, he wrote me a note as he died. I kept it, and Ive had it with me ever since. Im not going to upload it because I feel like this was for me and me only. I will tell you what it said, though.

Alex,

Over the years you have been an inspiration for me. When I told you that I loved you back in sixth grade, it wasnt just an overstatement due to my age. You were, and are, a truly amazing person. If I wanted to be honest, and I rarely do, I would say that I never stopped loving you. I hope you find out what happened to your girlfriend.

Thanks for hanging out with me all these years, and making the worms in my brain a little less terrible.

-Cass Caspian Hidritch.

The funeral was the next weekend. Closed casket, though, because his skin had become a deep blue as a result of whatever disease he had.

Excluding his family, I was the only person who showed up.

That night, the lights guided Cass to his resting place.

---

Guys, Im really sorry for having such a short update. Its difficult for me to think about that year. Or even that couple of days. I lost two incredibly important people that week, and I never got to say goodbye to one of them. I also underwent tons of stress and shock-- not only because of my loss but also because of the mystery behind them.

So far, writing this out hasnt given me all the answers I need. Ill keep trying until I feel like further action is needed-- but honestly, Ive never felt shittier, other than when I was living these experiences myself.

I also have to come clean about something. In the first chapter, I lied. I thought I might be able to get away with it, but because of some silly mistakes with the grades I was in during certain events, Id say its pretty obvious.

Im not an adult. In fact, I turn seventeen in October. I only very recently moved out of Dryston, after realizing that the place was doing me more harm than good.

~~

Also, /u/Iloveagoodscare addressed the fact that I shouldve warned Isabelle about talking to her father. To be honest, when I first read the comment, I was incredibly pissed. It felt like they were telling me it was my fault that she disappeared. But, I realize that a lot can be misconstrued when it comes to commenting on posts, so Im not going to assume that they meant any harm by the comment.

In fact, they were right. I didnt feel like what she was doing was right, but I didnt warn her about it. That makes her disappearance at least partially my fault.

~~

Ill actually respond to comments on this one, guys. I was emotionally exhausted with the last one, but Ive made peace with Cass death. At least I know what happened to him. Isabelle I still have no clue what happened to her.

Please, if you have any ideas, let me know.

Edit: Also, if you have any questions for me, I'd be happy to answer them. It's likely that I'll answer in both comment reply and update form, so don't get frustrated when you read the same thing twice.

Hey, guys. Alright, a small disclaimer: this update is gonna be fucking huge. It takes place throughout the entirety of my freshman year and covers a fuck ton of ground. Not only that, but its gonna be incredibly emotional for me to write anyway. So please allow me to write this out for you guys, and hopefully, the questions you (still) have will be answered.

Okay. Lets do this.

~~

Dryston was a small town. I dont know if Ive covered this in the past, but it was. Three-House Elementary had six teachers in all (Until the November of fifth grade, when the class above mine got closed up and nobody went into it again). Dryston Middle had about 500 students in all, ~250 per grade. 

Dryston High School had around 1000 students. Not a bunch. Each grade had around ten teachers, and each teacher taught every single subject. Because of some sort of change in the school system, Ms. P was teaching my ninth grade class. During the beginning of the year, Ms. P decided shed be teaching her class a bit differently than most-- shed separate us into pairs.

This doesnt mean you wont be able to socialize with each other, she explained, the point of this exercise is to not only get you to talk to people that you normally wouldnt, but also to help you understand subject materials that may be difficult without a second perspective.

So who did I get? Oh, come on, Im sure you can guess.

Thats right. Isabelle ***FUCKING*** Bewer. When she sat down next to me, I slammed my book into my face and let out a groan. She sat her bag down next to her chair and looked at me. I lowered my book and stared back at her.

She looked different. Not by a *ton*, but the change was definitely there. Her face was slimmer, her hair was fuller (and somehow an even shinier almond-brown than before), and her eyes were a shinier, brighter blue. Her skin looked Nicer, I suppose. I dont exactly know how to put that down correctly, but she just looked way more vibrant. She also seemed to have gone from an A cup to a C over the summer *Not that I was thinking about that or anything*.

I very suddenly realized she was saying something. Cheesy, I know, but it happens to the best of us. A split second later, I realized she was holding her hand out to me. And then I realized she was looking at me expectantly. I flushed red.

Im gonna have to ask you to repeat that.

She looked at me weird for a second, but then did something that surprised me. She giggled. *Damn it, shes actually super cute,* I thought.

Sure, Ill repeat myself. But only because you were checking me out for a solid five seconds.

I was n- I dont even know what youre talking about.

Mhm. Well, I was just saying that we havent gotten along super well in the past, and since we are sorta forced to work together this year, we might be able to try harder this time. Deal?

She once again held her hand out to me. This time, I shook it. The bell rang, and Ms. P began to introduce herself to the students that didnt know her yet. We turned to look at the whiteboard, and as Ms. P wrote her name, Isabelle leaned a little bit closer to me.

Youre pretty good looking, yourself.

Needless to say, I was shocked. Not so much because it was Isabelle that was flirting with me, but mostly because that was the most leeway I had gotten with a girl since seventh grade, and it all happened within the span of five minutes. 

Maybe that year wouldnt be so terrible.

~~

A few weeks later, Isabelle and I were in a relationship. The reason I dont say *dating* is because we werent exactly... *date* people. We liked the company of one another, regardless of where we were or what we were doing. Her parents didnt exactly agree with what we were doing, but they never voiced their objections either. They were really nice people; opening their home to me while my parents fought more and more often.

During those days, I could have sworn that the fact that I was gay was a contributing factor. They never said it outright-- but I could feel the tension whenever my Mother and I were in the same room. I made every attempt I could to try to repair our relationship, but no matter how hard I tried, she never met me halfway. Every time she resisted my love, I gave up and headed to Isas house (I still wish I had tried harder).

Her house was *nice*. Though we spent most of our time in her room, I appreciated how much work the Bewers put into making their house beautiful. I cant remember any specific details, I just remember being very impressed with the interior design.

Isabelles room, however, I remember like the back of my hand. It was huge, maybe 200 ft^2 . Her bed was up against the window facing Nightglow beach-- she told me that she loved the blue glow. Said she wished she could glow like that.

Every time I told her that she already shined in my eyes, she would push me back. She hated compliments, and I was her worst enemy.

She was honestly gorgeous. Ive [said before](https://redd.it/5ofqba) that I was a small girl, and that didnt change. She seemed to be perfect, though. Had all the right meat-bits in all the right places. Meanwhile, heres an [actual picture of me](https://wilybadger.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/stick.png). Not only was she physically beautiful, but she also had this charm about her that I absolutely loved.

She had this amazing optimism that I had just never seen before. Like, since she knew that everything was going to work out perfectly, it did. I spent a lot of nights with her, in her bed. She held me as I cried about Cass sickness, about school, about my parents. Never once did she complain to me. Never once did she cry, despite the fact that she had plenty of reasons to. The most prominent being that all I did was hold her back.

God, she was an artist. She could draw better than anybody Id ever seen, and she decided to use this talent to embarrass me. Despite only seeing me naked once (due to a swimsuit malfunction, at that), she was somehow able to perfectly replicate my body on paper. She flashed it to me, under her desk, one time. I blushed so hard I didnt even realize that Ms. P had called on me. I scanned the board and quickly told her the answer to the problem, but it turns out she was just trying to tell me that the contents of my backpack had spilled on the floor without me noticing.

I guess I was just kind of stupid.

---

When people started going missing, we freaked out. Of course, the local police department told us that there was nothing to worry about-- people were only leaving because a new cannery had opened up, and needed workers. All good. Well, by the time that my grade was reduced to about 100 people, we all began to get a little suspicious. 

At night, the lights would stay on, pointed upward, and flash. When the morse was translated, it said A Deed Greeneries Snips Volt Sonny Won. I figured it was an anagram, but never figured out what it meant. Maybe you guys can. 

One weekend, while she and I were at the library, Isabelle told me that she had made a breakthrough. Said that some sort of conspiracy was going on, and the local police were involved. Told me that there were undersea tests taking place near Haunted Island, that the people who work at Dryston Cannery, including her father, were trying to make mermaids or something. Obviously, I thought this was bullshit until she pulled a manila folder out of her backpack, and showed me all of the files inside.

I still didnt believe her-- I thought she was pulling a prank on me. But then I looked at her gorgeous, too-blue eyes and decided that she must be telling the truth. Nobody who looks that triumphant can lie.

I read along with her. Every page, every sentence, in an attempt to understand. A *lot* of it was redacted, but from what I gathered, what she was saying was true. Not the mermaid part- that was speculation (based off of the fact that the undersea tests were called Project Mermaid), but it was fairly evident that something big was going on. She told me she was going to confront her father about it.

Something in my stomach tugged, telling me not to let her.

 nbsp;

I ignored it.

 nbsp;

~~

The next day, I had completely forgotten about the conspiracy. I was just excited to see my girlfriend, see her smile. I sat down next to her and waited for her to turn to me. She didnt. I said her name, and she still didnt react. Finally, I tapped her shoulder.

She jumped and turned to me. Her eyes were wide as if she hadnt slept at all the previous night. They darted around the room like she was expecting to get attacked at any second. I shrunk back a little bit and watched as her eyes got a little bit more desperate.

You okay, babe? You dont look too hot.

What? Yeah, Im fine. Im fine.

Oh Okay. Do you want to talk about anything?

She took a deep breath and mumbled something. I asked her to repeat herself.

Im moving.

Those two words hit me like a freight train. Everything around me became still as my hair stood on end, and suddenly I was thrown violently through the air, twisting around as I tried to grab onto something stable, not caring if it would rip my arms out of their sockets in the process. I gasped.

Yeah. In fact, Im gonna get called down in a second I just wanted to come to school so I could say my final goodbyes to you.

I hit the ground, tumbling and scraping against the tracks as the train moved over me, slicing my face and arms until I screamed for mercy. I wiped my tears from my face.

Well, at least well still have emails and stuff, right? We can make this work.

She smiled at me sadly, as if I was a little kid who couldnt grasp the idea that his grandmother was gone and never, ever coming back.

Yeah. Well still have that.

I smiled back, not understanding why she was acting so strangely. Usually, she was so forward with everything she did, never resorting to passive aggressiveness or withholding information. 

A knock shocked both of us to full alert. Mr. Bewer (who had obviously been crying for hours before he even got to school) walked in the door and beckoned Isabelle over. She nodded once and stood up. Before she left, she turned to me and whispered the most important few sentences Ive ever heard, and I doubt Ill ever hear anything more chilling.

Do not visit the cannery at night. The signs say no trespassing. Look at the Nightglow, instead. I love you, Alex.

That was the first time she had ever told me she loved me, but somehow the rest of her message carried more meaning. I shivered involuntarily-- not just because of what she had said, but also because her eyes were so *blue*.

I love you too, Isa.

She nodded and walked to her Dad. He gave her a tight hug and held her head as if it was the first time he had seen her in months. They walked out the door and closed it. 

I tried to hear their conversation, but I couldnt make out any words.

Her dad asked a question. She mustve shaken her head, or maybe I just didnt hear her answer because a second later my thoughts were interrupted by the loudest door slam Ive ever heard.

When we were let out of class, I left the school the same way she had that day. One of the art students must have made a mistake, because there were splotches of drying blue paint, with pink sponge clumps in them all on the wall.

When I got home, I emailed her. Ive never gotten a response, though Ive had the same email for all the years since.

That night, the lights didnt seem to matter at all.

---

Ive been pretty active in the comments for my other posts, but I hope you guys understand if I dont reply as much to your comments on this one. This post has taken a toll on me. Not only did I rewrite it several times, but I also broke down crying a few times as well. 

Thank you all for your well wishes and for your overwhelming support of this series. Isabelle always loved my writing, and I think shed be proud of me for writing this out. Ill update you guys when the next chapter is out.

Thanks,

Alex.

	<TEXT> Yeah, Cass was a chill guy. Isabelle... She was something else entirely. I don't know why I invested so much energy into hating her through middle school, but I'm glad I got to know her. 

She actually turned out to be incredibly kind, and loving. If there's anybody in Dryston that didn't deserve that kind of hate, it was her. 

Thanks for reading these! The next update is gonna be huge, so I hope you're prepared for that. </TEXT>

Hey, guys. I realize my last update was a bit confusing-- I skipped over some important details for the sake of just getting this all to the public. I apologize for that, Ill try my best to clear all that up right now.

Firstly, /u/Nyltiak23 expressed confusion when it came to Cass prank on me when he puked out the blue fluid. He didnt actually eat it, he just had it in his mouth. At the time I just figured it was something with food coloring and the glow was just an illusion, but when I was looking at the algae I realized that he had actually put the Nightglow into his mouth. At first, I was disgusted, but I got over it pretty quickly.

Secondly, I never told you guys what was in the Nightglow-covered box. This was intentional. I hope todays update will help you guys understand a bit better.

This update begins during November of the fifth grade, exactly a month after my tenth birthday (October third). This update also has a couple stories wrapped into one, which will hopefully give you guys more insight into why Im writing about Dryston in the first place.

~~

The leaves under my feet crunched as I walked to school, Cass by my side. Three-House Elementary went from Kindergarten to Sixth grade, a fact I was grateful for seeing as my best friend was in the grade above. His backpack was slung over only one shoulder; he thought he looked cool that way. I made fun of him for it, though mostly because I was a fairly small girl and therefore wouldnt even be able to do that if I tried. As I chattered away in his ear, he nodded once or twice.

Recently, he had been a bit quieter toward me than usual. I knew I shouldntve let it hurt me, but it certainly did. He barely talked to me anymore, not even during recess! I didnt let the anger out on him, though. I just sorta stewed away with his lack of communication, wondering if I had hurt him in some way. At least, thats what I had resolved to up to that moment.

I stopped talking about whatever it was I was talking about (probably something about codes-- I used to be obsessed with cryptology) and asked him outright if I had made him mad in some way. It took a second for him to respond, but when he did everything became clear.

What? No, you could never make me mad, Alex. Im actually uh

I waited a few seconds for him to spit it out. When he didnt, I had to yell his name.

OKAY, fine. Dont laugh.

I promised not to.

Im in love with you.

Everything froze. I stopped in my tracks and just stared at him. He looked back at me, hesitantly, as if I was a bomb about to blow. And I was.

I cracked *up*. I almost fell to the ground, I was laughing so hard. He got mad at me, of course, but I didnt care. For some reason (read: lesbianism), me actually being in a relationship with him was hilarious.

He didnt think so.

I apologized for breaking my promise and told him Id rather just be friends with him. He took it like a champ. We both eventually moved on from it to the point where I was perfectly comfortable with him [seeing me in my underwear](https://redd.it/5o8hvu). 

After that little experience, we finally got to school. He walked into the far right House, while I went to the one in the middle. I put my backpack in my cubby and got to my desk. I was in one of the center rooms, in Mrs. Moody's fifth-grade class. This meant that we had no windows. Which means that when the power went out, everybody freaked out. So I was stuck in the center desk, in the center room, in the center House, with a bunch of screaming fifth-grade girls.

It was hell. 

After the calamity slowed down a bit, I realized two things.

1. I couldnt see a single thing in the room-- except for everybodys eyes. Somehow, their eyes had a very subtle blue glow behind them, like in a cartoon.
2. There was scratching and knocking coming from above us.

The scratching seemed random at first, and people started to lose it again when they heard it, but eventually I realized it was a pattern.

I told everybody to shut up, so I could decipher what was obviously morse code. 

Knock, knock, knock, scratch, silence, knock, scratch, silence, scratch, knock, silence, knock, knock, silence, knock, knock, knock, silence, knock, knock, knock, knock, silence, knock, scratch, knock, knock. 

*Vanished*

As soon as I had figured it out, I told the teacher. A second later, the lights turned on, and we were all sent home for the day. Our TVs and radios instructed us to stay in the lowest levels of our homes, stay inside, and ignore any sounds we hear above us.

The police never found the kids that went missing from the class above us that day.

---

Later that month, our class was given a project. We were to create a box full of things from our everyday lives, to put into the water and hopefully end up in the possession of somebody else, so they can learn more about our lives in Dryston. We werent supposed to say anything about where we were from, not even the town, but we could put whatever we wanted in there otherwise.

I decided to get a jar, fill it with Nightglow and put it in the box as my contribution. Isabelle Bewer, the class rich girl, put in a brand new iPod Touch (as they had just come out a few months before). I forget what everybody else put in, I just remember being angry that *she* could do whatever she wanted. I honestly hated her back then. That would change, though.

We put the box in the water on Nightglow beach and watched it float away (toward what I would later learn is called the Haunted Island). A few kids lost interest and started skipping rocks, or throwing them at each other, but I continued to watch the box until we had to make our way back to the school.

That night was uneventful, without any lights or Notres Passings. The next morning, however, the entirety of the Dryston Police Department was standing on the edge of the water, as well as a few Dryston employees, staring out toward where I had watched the box drift off. When I got into school, there were a few cops in my classroom. They told me that school was out, and I could just go back home (the amount of times I was let out of school in Dryston was ridiculous).

The next day, we had a new teacher named Ms. P (shortened, because her last name was about eight syllables). She was super nice, but I always wondered what had happened to Mrs. Moody, as I never saw her again after the police showed up.

For a few weeks, the lights stayed on all night, each of them pointed in the direction of the water.

Hey, guys. Some of you showed interest in this continuing Im pretty happy about that. I know that Cass wouldve been. To be honest, though, Id continue updating this whether you liked it or not. I need to get this story out there.

This chapter of the story begins a day after my fourteenth birthday, as it was the second strange thing that happened in Dryston. Or, at least, the second thing I remembered. Here it is.

~~

As I woke up, still groggy from the fact that the lights had been on exceptionally long, I noticed a sound at my window. I sat up, turned around (as my window was at the head of my bed), and was met with the face of a monster-- the thing that Cass had described as a Notres Passing over the years.

Its face was barely clinging to its head. It had huge teeth, and eyes that were bugging out of its skull. I yelped and fell off my bed, then scurried under it. Then I heard something that shocked me more than anything-- it was laughing. I peeked out from under my bed, looked up at it, and was met with

Cass. Laughing his ass off.

OH, YOU ASSHOLE! I whisper-shouted. What the FUCK, dude? He placed the (obviously home-made) mask back onto his face, and made a sound that resembled a raspberry, but with more coughing. You alright, dude? That sounded pretty bad. He took the mask off and continued coughing until he threw up in the bushes. The puke was blue and seemed to glow.

Jesus Christ, dude. Youre still fucking with me. He looked at me and smiled again.

Dude, nobody suspects the double-prankeroo. You shouldve seen your face. 

I looked at him resentfully. What do you want, man? Im still in my underwear. 

He told me to get dressed and come outside, said that hed found something. I put on some pants and a T-Shirt, wondering what this was about. It was Sunday, so I shouldve been working on my homework, but it was obvious that wasnt going to happen. I was too curious to see what he had discovered. Id like to put something about curiosity and cats here, but Im afraid itd be much too subtle for you guys to understand.

We set out that morning, turning our hoodies to the early October breeze. He lead me to the rocky beach nicknamed Nightglow Beach, because of the way the sand near the water shined at night. I would later find out that it was caused by bioluminescent algae, but until then I watched the shore during my night walks, mesmerized (I, of course, always returned home before midnight. Not only was it the towns curfew, but I was in general unsettled by the lights that came on then).

Cass led me to a canoe just big enough for the two of us and told me to hop in. When I asked if it was his, he just smiled slyly at me. I said Fuck it, and just got in the boat.

He did the majority of the paddling. One; because I didnt know where we were going, and Two; because I didnt know how to paddle anyway. An hour later we got to a small island, with a single pine tree on it. Underneath the tree was a gravestone, made out to a dog. I have a picture of it somewhere, Ill upload it when I can. Im pretty sure its at my Dads house, though, so Ill have to make the time to get over there and grab it (that, and Im pretty sure the map is there too if he hasnt burned it already). Next to the gravestone was a small red lockbox. Obviously, I didnt have the key, so I turned to him to ask if he did.

Yep.

He began to kick the rusted padlock until it broke off, and then opened up the top of the box to see what was inside. It was a note, and this is what it said.

The Notres Passing isnt what it sounds like. Its a nickname given by children, but the creature behind the name is very real. Avoid it if you *can*, and avoid the light as well. The smell of fish, while not unfamiliar, is alien in its own right.

I stared at Cass, pissing out my ears. Are you fucking serious, dude? We rowed all this way for another one of your fucking pranks? I was pissed at him. Not just because I thought he was pranking me, but also because I had just realized that I hadnt eaten anything all day.

My stomach growled in agreement.

While Cass was swearing up and down that he hadnt written the note, I checked the boat for food. It was unsurprisingly vacant. But as I was checking, I noticed a glow underneath where we had set the boat. 

Cass, come here.

He looked up at me, confused. I beckoned him over, and he saw the light of the metal object underneath.

Theres something there! He ingeniously shouted.

Wow, really?

Yeah! Its underneath the-

Im fucking with you, dude. I see it. Help me move the boat.

We both lifted the boat and turned it, as I tried to pry the object out of the sand. He nearly dropped the canoe on my hand a few times, but eventually I got it out.

It was another lockbox.

This one was significantly less rusted, somehow, as though it had only been placed there the previous day. It was confusing, to say the least, but I understood when I fully pulled it out of the water.

It was covered in goo.

Or, at least, thats what it seemed to be at first. I later realized that it was the same algae from Nightglow Beach that was covering the box, which is why I noticed its telltale blue shine.

This is when I realized a second thing.

Jesus, dude, you had this in your mouth?

He looked at me sheepishly and hesitantly nodded.

Fucking gross, man I paused for a second. How did it taste?

Surprisingly familiar.

I shook my head and clambered into the boat, this time assisting more while we rowed back to the mainland.

When we got back, we were met by two cops and a Dryston employee. The employee had his arms crossed as if we had done something bad. Well, we *had* stolen a boat, but that was hardly the point. We had returned it, anyway.

Apparently, though, that wasnt why we were in trouble. It was because we had visited the Haunted Island, as the cops called it. Apparently, ghosts had been haunting the place since a guy went and killed himself there in the early eighties, and fishermen had been avoiding the place ever since. I was, at the time, a hard denier of ghosts, spirits, and hauntings; I called bullshit.

I earned a couple looks for that one-- especially from the cops. Apparently, ghosts were a big thing around Dryston-- so much so that doubting them could get you in trouble. 

I got in trouble.

I had to wait around in a jail cell for a full *two hours* before my parents showed up. When I told them what had happened, they told me not to talk back to authorities, no matter how ridiculous what theyve said is. After a silent dinner, they sent me to my room.

I was angry. Really angry. So, in a flash of teenage brilliance, I decided to leave the house at midnight. I waited around, just hoping to find out what was happening when the lights came on. Something at the back of my mind was nagging at me, telling me that the Notres Passing was indeed *real*, and not just a prank set up by my best friend.

That night, the lights never came on.

This will be a series, and it has the possibility of being quite long. It takes place between the ages of Nine to Seventeen, in a town called Dryston, which was named for the large meat cannery in the center of town that pulled in most of the towns money. Ive spent most of my adulthood confused and wondering about my past, but I think Im finally putting the pieces together.

~~


When I was nine, my Dad (an electrical engineer) had us pack up all of our things and move to a town called Dryston. Being young, I wasnt leaving much behind, excepting a fourth-grade class of the meanest nine-year-olds you could meet. And, being an only child, I was thrilled. My Mom, however, was not. I remember them arguing in the kitchen about it one day.


...Its not the end of the world, Lizzie! Dryston is only a day away, and- -in the Middle of Buttfuck, Nowhere! My Mom interrupted. Dave, I cant do this. I have friends here. A job. My Dad, however, didnt think that was the biggest deal in the world. I do too, but Im not gonna waste away waiting for a promotion when I can get a better-paying job! Especially one in the middle of some of the most beautiful woods in Maine-- Buttfuck, Nowhere as you said. This can be another big adventure for the family, Liz. Please.


My Mom obliged, so long as we left after I finished fourth grade. 


The drive up was, for the most part, unremarkable. I spent the majority of it sleeping. However, as we got closer and closer to Dryston, I began to see fewer buildings, and smell more fish. I chalked it up to it being a port town and moved on to more interesting things. My dad passed a map of the town back to me, one he drew himself (If I can find it, Ill link it at some point). 


What I found pretty strange was that the cannery took up much of the center of the town, with most of the roads leading straight to it. Our house was pretty far from the cannery, in the northeast of the town, but it was on one of the roads that lead directly to it. By the time I was finished analyzing the map, we had pulled up to our house. We put all our boxes inside and then went out to look around the town.


We saw the school first. As it turns out, the elementary school was three houses that had been put together to make the appropriate amount of rooms (as the old school had burned down. The local cops suspected arson, but nobody was ever convicted or even accused). Since it was the middle of summer, there was nobody in the school that we could talk to yet, and no friends for me to be introduced to in a smooth manner.


Then, we saw the cannery. It was huge and had a large tower on the top that looked like a cell tower. Strapped to the top were three lights that pointed in different directions, though none of them were on. The two men who were speaking to each other right outside the building noticed us and walked inside. Being the curious kid I was, I wanted to follow. But I couldnt.


There was a twenty-foot barbed wire fence around the entire building. How welcoming.


We went to the beach, skipped a few stones, and then headed back home.


In the middle of the night, the smell of fish got stronger. And the lights on top of the cannery turned on, illuminating the entire town. I could never prove it, but I could have sworn I saw some people walk off their porches and head to the cannery. By the time my eyes were adjusted, though, they were gone.


The next week I met my best friend, Cass. He was in the grade above me, he loved chicken wings, and he had pretty much broken every bone possible and never even cried. To me, that made him the coolest person in the world. 


I decided to ask him, one day, about the lights at night. At this point, I had been in the town for about three weeks, and they happened every once and awhile. I hadnt ever been told why it happened, and anytime I asked somebody they just got all quiet. Eventually, I learned that you just shouldnt talk about it.


As expected, Cass got all quiet. But unlike everybody else, he actually told me what he thought was going on. He said that it was the way the town has worked since before he could remember.


Its the Notres Passing, he explained, Theyre monsters that come out at night sometimes, and make the lights on the Cannery go all bright. At least, thats what my cousin told me.


I, being the smart one, understood that the entire explanation was bullshit-- punctuated by the fact that he had named the monsters No Trespassing. I told him that, and he told me to suck one. I obviously refused to do so.


That night, the lights came on again. And they stayed on until sunrise.
