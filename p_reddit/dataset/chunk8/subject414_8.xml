	<TEXT> I always look/feel the neck, that is number one for me. It has to play well or no amount of tweaking of pickups, etc. will help it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Session work is tough, it's not what you know but who you know.

As far as tech jobs, you basically just have to work your way up the ladder. Find a smaller band, start touring with them then make contacts with bigger acts and try to get hired on. There is no shortcut.

An English lighting guy once told me "It's the hardest job to get into , but it's even harder to get out of". Very true as guitar tech skills don't really translate to work at home unless you want to be a luthier or repair man.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked in a couple of music stores and also was in a regional touring band myself, that morphed into teching for some friends bands. Some of those bands got signed to major labels in the early 90's, so we all jumped in a van and toured the US and eventually Europe.

I had a couple of friends who were roadies (techs) for bigger bands such as Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine, and eventually my name got given to some production manager and I got a call and ended up on my first tour bus. From there, since this business is all word of mouth, you work for the opening band, meet the guys in the headliner's crew, do a good job, make contacts, get a call from one of those contacts for another gig, rinse, repeat ;)

I was actually semi-retired when I got called for Aerosmith in 2002. I turned it down, then called my wife , she said "Call them back"... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe try some of the coated strings. More expensive, but might save money in the long run (less string changes). Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good rule of thumb is to try an plug every piece of your rig into the same outlet via a power strip, etc. That will keep the ground loops to a minimum. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. At some point probably, but these tube guitar amps have been around for 60+ years and most are still going strong. I'm sure software will have it's place especially with younger more tech savvy players and I'm not against it. But for a guitar player there is nothing like standing in front of a cranked amp, nothing. </TEXT>
