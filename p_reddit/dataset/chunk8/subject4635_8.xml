	<TEXT> If you are 20-0 in a game you are really good and/or the other team is really bad. The chance of you going 20-0 by luck is unlikely. If you are the ADC and you are 20-0 then yes you should be able to carry. If you are 20-0 and are the support and your ADC is struggling to kill people because you took most of the gold from kills then yes it is still your fault if you lose the game.

You could go 20-0 but not pressure any other lanes and only go for kills and the other team could catch up, get into late game, and beat your team. You can always find a way to blame yourself for a loss, realize what you did wrong, and try not to do it again. This is what qtpie is saying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The one thing with the failures that Microsoft has put out is usually that they learn from their mistakes. Zune actually was a pretty good device, it just had to compete with the iPod which dominated the MP3 device market. A lot of ideas from Zune helped shape what Windows Phone is now. Microsoft actually took a big risk with Windows Phone because they basically started from scratch on Windows Phone 7 when they dropped Windows Mobile 6.5. Windows Phone isn't doing as great as they hope probably but it is slowly growing. It's now seen as the third major mobile phone OS.

Hopefully Microsoft does more things like Windows Phone, Surface (yeah Surface RT was shit but the Pro is amazing), and Xbox One. We will have to see how Xbox One pans out but I have a feeling they won't fuck it up too badly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your opinion is really interesting. I can see why kids are a lasting mark on Earth. All things do come to an end, even humanity itself will, probably, come to an end. Having a lineage is one way though to continue a lasting mark on Earth. You can still make a lasting mark on Earth by not having kids though. Inventions that have changed the way the world works have lasting marks generation through generation, the elimination of diseases is a big one. The group of people that help eliminate cancer will probably be remembered though the end of humanity.

On the other hand what if you don't want to have a lasting mark on the world? Helping somebody down on their luck or loving someone and being with them is still a great thing to do. And even if people die and nations fall you still changed somebody's life for the better. Nobody knows the true meaning of life, there is no real endgoal, everything comes to an end whether it be 50 years from now or millions of years later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So if you are born into this world the one true responsibility you have to the world is to have children? What? It seems like to you part of "growing up and taking responsibility" is having kids. What about owning a business or helping people less fortunate than you. Studying and progressing the human race. These are all great things but if you don't have kids that makes you irresponsible?

What about caring for and for providing for your significant other? Being there for somebody else in this world no matter what you two go through is probably one of the most noble things somebody can do. But apparently having kids makes you not responsible... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made a tiny little app that can open Twitch streams in VLC. It only works on Windows. You must have VLC installed. If you don't have VLC installed in the default location you can browse to where it is installed and still use this app. It isn't heavily tested so if stuff breaks I can't help you.

It uses the [Twitch API](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API) and a [C# library](https://github.com/subject4635/Twixel) for the Twitch API I wrote.

	<TEXT> The end of season 2 changes worked in the fact that ADC's aren't the only massively damaging thing on a team. Other members of the team matter now and they can deal damage. However I feel that in season 2 since the ADC was the most important role that teams would do anything to defend/peel for their ADC. Now ADC doesn't do all the team's damage so teams can decide to try to burst down the APC/assassin/ADC.

The thing that annoys me the most is that a second of CC on an ADC can spell death for them no matter how well they play a teamfight. In return ADC's don't do that much damage for how weak they are now. I don't think Riot wants to return to the strength of season 2 ADC's and I think buffing ADC's survivability would be much healthier for the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think one of reasons that AS isn't the greatest on Vayne is because damage is also pretty good on her. Her Q does 50% of her bonus AD at level 5 and her R gives her 55 bonus AD. With a lot of AD and armor pen she can cut through targets. Mid season 3 people also realized that you can build her with with AS in mind and use her W with true damage to cut through targets.

Like you said Lucian, Jinx, and Sivir don't need to build AS because they get it for free. They only have one reliable build path while other ADC's like Vayne, Cait, and Varus have to decide between AS or AD weighted builds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think one of the reasons double gold item made it through was that they also tested pre season changes with pros first and got a lot of feedback there. I think Riot trusted the pros more than PBE and that's why they weren't too worried about the item until it saw massive abuse on the live servers. Realize that the number of pros they could have tested the changes on is a small number and that the PBE server also has a small number of people. Also the whole point of preseason is to test new changes before the new season comes in so major imbalances don't affect the real season. </TEXT>

It's really only the new stuff that have bugs in them and those only come out every once in a while. </TEXT>

Also a massive bug was just found where minions that hit inhibitors would crash the game. This bug would not have been found if SR wasn't available. I also feel like people are somewhat more dedicated to a matchmaking game than a custom game. If PBE was limited to customs only I would think the amount of leavers and AFK's would shoot through the roof. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate Operation Locker but loved Operation Metro 8v8 rush. That was the only mode where the map was great. 8v8 your team has to work together or you lose. There are enough people and the map is small enough to feel like there is always action but there are few enough people where flanking is possible. I never understood why people enjoyed 64v64 spam fests on conquest on that map because there the map sucks. The map however excels at smaller infantry style combat.

I feel like I would enjoy Locker a bit more if it was played with lower player counts (and wasn't always on conquest large) but it seems like most servers keep the player counts high because that's "the battlefield way". Battlefield is great at large combat but BF3 and BF4 have really improved on its smaller map infantry based engagements without it feeling like a game of COD (conquest and rush mainly). </TEXT>

Riven being able to jump over walls originally happened because Riot made some map collision fixes and somehow those changes allowed Riven to jump over walls.

	<TEXT> They last time they bandaided a champion it was Olaf. Look what happened to him. When Voyboy did really well with Olaf Riot said "we have to nerf this" ant just went with a quick easy fix without carefully looking at the impact of those changes.

Now they've learned and take their time when doing large buffs or nerfs on champs. Riot has been mulling over Rengar changes for months they just haven't said anything major till now. Jayce is getting big changes to reduce his power probably next patch but they are asking for a lot of feedback on the PBE forums on how to go about it. Xerath is getting reworked because hes supposed to be a powerful burst mage but nobody plays him but they are carefully taking the time to fix him instead of over buffing him and calling it a day. They are fixing Yorick and they are always asking for feedback on what his new kits should look like. Riot isn't stupid. It just looks like they take a while to change things because they iterate heavily internally without any announcements and then when they are closer to completion they ask for input from the community. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I redid my damage calculations for Master Yi's damage output (x-post /r/leagueoflegends) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-05 01:45:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In my first set of calculations I didn't account for crit change or Shiv's damage so the numbers were off. Also the targets I used were at a lower point than what a full build target would be at. So this time around crits are calculated across the board. On Yi's AA damage, on his Q damage, and on his Shiv magic damage. I also used two different kinds of runes on him. AD reds and Armor Pen reds. [I also used 21 points in the Offensive tree.](http://i.imgur.com/ymEwi3I.png) I included 2% damage from all sources (except true damage), Frenzy's bonus attack speed, and 5% more damage to targets under 50% health from Executioner. The builds however were the same from last time.

Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Bloodthirster, Phantom Dancer, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Bloodthirster, Statikk Shiv, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Blade of the Ruined King, Phantom Dancer, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Blade of the Ruined King, Statikk Shiv, Last Whisper

For targets I now used 3 full build targets. A very squishy champ, the tankiest ADC, and a tank. All these targets also used magic resist per level blues and armor yellows. For the squishy target I chose Zyra who had Liandry's Torment and Zhonya's Hourglass as health and defensive items with [9 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/cvpQB5J.png) Her health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 2125, 133, and 56 respectively.

For the tankiest ADC I used Graves who had his passive fully stacked and had either Guardian's Angel or Randuin's Omen as a defensive item. He also had [9 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/cvpQB5J.png) His health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 2060, 170.6, and 102 for GA and 2560, 190.6, and 62 for Randuin's.

For the tank target I chose Shen with Armor boots, Sunfire Cape, Locket of the Iron Solari, Spirit Visage, Trinity Force, and either Warmog's or Randuin's as his last item. He also had [22 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/ac0uF6W.png) I did apply the 2 less damage from all sources (except for true damage), 3 less damage from all AA's, 10% less crit damage from all sources (this includes Master Yi's Q), and 3% less damage from all sources (except for true damage). Shen's health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 4675.84, 170.6, and 113.475 with Warmog's and 4155.84, 261.3, and 113.475 with Randuin's.

When calculating the damage from items, actives, passives and whatever else was there I did include Q's damage, BotRK's active damage, and Shiv's damage all the time if applicable. However for Q and Shiv I did two separate calculations for if they did or did not crit since you Q once at the beginning before you auto attack them and since Shiv only procced once during all the fights (Yes, everybody died in under 10 auto attacks).

After all that pre-explanation here is all the data I collected: http://sdrv.ms/12QhWBB

**TL;DR:** If you want to kill a lower health/armor target go BotRK with either PD or Shiv with Armor Pen reds. If you want to kill a tanky ADC without Randuin's go BotRK with either PD or Shiv. Reds don't matter here. However if the ADC has Randuin's go BT with PD and Armor Pen reds but only if your Q crits. If your Q doesn't crit then go BotRK with PD. If you want to kill a tank with or without Randuin's go BotRK with PD and Armor Pen reds.

**TL;DR of the TL;DR: Run BotRK, PD, and Armor Pen reds on Yi.**

Now here are the results:

**KEY:**  
BRK = Blade of the Ruined King  
BT = Bloodthirster  
PD = Phantom Dancer  
Shiv = Statikk Shiv  
AD = Attack Damage Reds  
AR = Armor Pen Reds

Remember Q and any actives are applied first before auto attacks.
