	<TEXT> Telecoms/ISPs actually have a far worse record of cooperating illegally with authorities and of security in general. Congress literally had to write laws after the fact to legalize illegal activity AT T did to facilitate the mirroring and splitting of the US West Coast's entire signals feed that William Binney blew the whistle on last decade.

Not to let the tech giants off for their malfeasance, but revoking the ISP privacy laws is even worse than you suggest. It's like, "I've got an idea  Let's add a pack of rabid wolves to join these other wolves who are devouring the villagers!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I and we have a big crush on /u/ThatOnePrivacyGuy's [Choosing The Best VPN For You Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/4ihtdj/that_one_privacy_guys_guide_to_choosing_the_best/). He's put a thousand+ hours on it. No affiliate advertisers, no sponsors. Just a discreet button on his site asking for donations (**Do this!**). Very impartial and objective. Also making it all available on a website, with all the extra work that entails.

The recent law allowing ISPs to spy on all their customers if it makes them even more money has turned your ISP to a big part of everyone's threat model: if they're collecting and tracking your every activity online so their execs can buy that third vacation home, it means someone else can use it too (hackers, plaintiffs, authorities, other nations' authorities)

Largely, a reliable VPN is your best defense against this threat. 

I'm just really freaking glad that ThatOnePrivacyGuy started his guide so long ago and makes it available to us now. It's really great timing and very generous of him! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *The Intercept's* Sam Biddle has an article, above, that raises a point that the ISP folks raise over and again. Since Facebook watches everything you do and they make money this way, why can't we make money this way, in addition to our traditional, oligopoly rent-taking way? That's more fair and don't you believe in fairness?! And, Our industry remains committed to offering services that protect the privacy and security of the personal information of our customers!

Sam asks them, 

How does the sale of ISP browsing history to advertisers improve customer privacy?

[Lobbyist Overlord] Howard Waltzman, replied, Id turn the question around a little bit: Today the norm for the entire rest of the internet ecosystem is that edge providers, advertisers are able to share non-sensitive information on an opt-out basis The question is, why would you have different rules for ISPs in that regard?

This response was akin to those provided by Sims and the NCTA, eager to point out that edge providers  content companies, in regulatory speak  like Facebook are already selling your information to advertisers, so why cant your ISP, too? Which is a great point, actually, but not one that explains how you can reconcile a commitment to customer privacy with the commodification of that customers browsing habits.

It's actually a lousy point. If I use Facebook (hahaha!), what I do *on Facebook* is slurped up then blended   spindled so my bits can be sold to teeming millions. Hey, Zuckerberg needs to level another couple square blocks of the SF Mission district for his sixth home  I get it.

But. I can *choose* not to visit Facebook. Or Google. Or Ashley Madison. Yahoo! My doctor. My lawyer. My drug dealer. (*Kidding!*  I don't have a lawyer).

If someone I know  who is definitely *not* me but is a friend, so I'm speaking for him  visits a pr0n site, *totally by mistake,* Facebook won't know. 

My ISP, on the other hand, will know. And they'll know about any Internet of Things devices, any smart TVs, devices and any guests. They'll know when I'm home and much of what I do while at home. (Well, technically, they won't since we're taking counter-measures but we're not most people).

Don't believe the lobbyist overlords' lies, in other words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is, under FTC rules the burden is on consumers or (the *totally super-aggressive GOP-led FTC who TOTALLY has our backs!*) commissioners to file a complaint, then years later rule on it. Versus recategorizing ISPs as common carriers, setting up an equivalent rule that FTC has but the FCC did not, then the burden is on ISPs . 

Like claims of "liberating the internet" used to roll back these protections, it's a bait-and-switch.

But it's cunning. I'll give it that. ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reasonable people may differ on the wisdom of using products from a company like Apple putting millions of very smart engineering hours to [ensuring their customers' privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) or vastly smaller teams with more modest budgets trying to reach similar goals.

I'm okay with Apple. Then again, I'm not a Jeremy Scahill, Glenn Greenwald or Laura Poitras.

I don't trust companies who make money by selling your data or have a longstanding, cooperative relationships with governments. That rules out Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. We expect (and want) Apple to respond to legal demands, but we also want them to fight for our privacy and resist sweeping ones. 

General rule  local backups. Encrypt everything. Don't jailbreak. Do update. Be leery of third-party Apps (but not paranoid). The higher your Threat Profile, the more things you need to ratchet up. 

Mobile using cellular is such a jerry-rigged mess that if you have one, consider it a vulnerability: the baseband stuff and the like.

On the other hand, I have friends who are 100% FLOSS. This is fine, too. We're happy with each others' choices since we recognize we're both sensible people applying different threat profiles and judgement to our individual situation.

Doing *something* is far better than doing nothing.

That said, the threat in this case is your ISP. And the only defense for that would be a VPN, Tor or TAILS, in ascending order of sacrifice. Using a VPN on your iDevices or Mac is a simple configuration issue. OpenVPN for MacOS and there's built-in support for VPNs in your iPhone   iPad Preferences panel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ditto, plus one!

I'll also include [a comment made by the founder of an independent ISP](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/). Sonic.net, a California independent ISP, in this case. They compete on service and price, but also ethical things like providing their users more privacy. You're also striking a blow against these entrenched oligopolies by supporting independents.

Dane Jasper (/u/danejasper) urged people to try finding and supporting one in your area.  

I'll echo Jeremy's response here, in particular the point about selecting a competitive ISP. There are hundreds of smaller regional carriers around the US, and finding one in your area that has strong privacy practices and a stance on network neutrality is a good way to both protect yourself, and to vote with your wallet.

While it has not been updated in the last couple years, a good place to start is the national broadband map: https://www.broadbandmap.gov/

Also check carrier and wireless ISP trade association membership for your area, for example [FISPA](http://www.fispa.org/where-we-are/) and [WISPA](http://www.wispa.org/Directories/Member-Directory) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's funny when I see this comment. And I see it a *lot* because the telecomm companies' lobbyists spent millions to get the Republicans to pass this bill for them. I'd be a bit miffed if I discovered I had been suckered by lobbyist PR campaigns, but that's me. 

The short version is ISPs being reclassified as a common carrier so sensible, additional rules could be enforced following a Supreme Court case forcing the change. This moved jurisdiction from the FTC to the FCC. The FTC has rules preventing ISPs from taking advantage of their privileged, oligopoly status to surveil and alter their customers' web traffic in pernicious ways. The FCC required new rules (thus that's where the claim that "nothing has changed" come from). 

ISPs were very sensibly prevented from manipulating customers' internet traffic under FTC jurisdiction. These rules don't exist under FCC jurisdiction. It's *really* important ISPs aren't allowed to manipulate customers' internet traffic: common sense, right? Would *you* want someone else watching and manipulating **all** *your* internet traffic? Why not?

So, your talking point is technically correct. It is also wrong, since the switch from FTC to FCC required a change. It's a misleading talking point foisted by the telecommunications oligopolies. Since they **are** under this new jurisdiction, **new** rules, to ensure ISPs operate under the **same** rules the ISPs happily operated under before, are required. Which the Senate Republicans shot down.

Lots of really good background, facts and strategies going forward, including choosing alternate ISPs that won't monitor/manipulate your web traffic, VSPs you can trust and Tor (and the trade-offs for each).

It's a *major* drag we couldn't convince the Republican House to grow a pair, have a conscience and represent someone besides those ten-odd lobbying groups that bought them off for peanuts, but what's as important is that we fight them, yesterday, today and tomorrow. Educate your friends as well.

Note: observing that 215 Republican House Representatives voted for the bill, vs. 190 Democratic Reps (and 15 Republicans) voted against it isn't being partisan. It's being factual. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the run-up to the hearing, privacy campaigners argued that ISPs should be treated differently from Google and Facebook, as in many cases consumers only have one choice of broadband provider. You can choose not to use Facebook or Googles search engine, and there are lots of tools you can use to block their tracking on other parts of the web, for example, [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) from the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org) (EFF), a nonprofit civil liberties group.

Its much harder to prevent ISPs from tracking you. To mask all of your browsing behavior you can use a VPN service (which incurs a subscription cost) or try using Tor, both of which make browsing more complicated.

Note: /u/Thatoneprivacyguy's excellent [Guide to Choosing The Best VPN For You](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/4ihtdj/that_one_privacy_guys_guide_to_choosing_the_best/) is one of the best, most objective and updated VPN guide I'm familiar with. And in general, check out /r/PrivacyToolsIO for other technology-based news and /r/Privacy for privacy-related news.

Whats the next step for privacy campaigners? The EFFs Jeremy Gillula said: Its certainly a bit of a Hail Mary, but I think wed try to convince President Trump that signing a bill that helps big corporate interests by eliminating Americans privacy and weakening their cybersecurity isnt exactly draining the swamp.

*Ha ha ha ha. Ha.* See above, protect yourself. And consider an alternate ISP if there's one in your area who refuses to engage in this uhh what's the word Privacy rape. Sonic.net is one such example, for CA. Anyone recommend any others?

If that doesnt work, then we can still try to make some headway with state legislatures; continue working to encrypt the entire web; and work harder on creating other, easy-to-use tools people can use to protect their privacy from the snooping eyes of their internet provider. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the striking things to me seems to be that, once things are explained in understandable terms, people on both sides of the political divide are sharply against recent Republican proposals.

"Should your ISP be allowed to monitor and manipulate everything you do online when it benefits them?" is not a dog that's going to hunt.

I can't (just) blame Conservatives, since Fortune 500 handouts are why they exist. You can't blame rain for being wet. I can blame the (corporate) media as much or more. It's important to make these calls to Congress today, but what can be done about the broader problem about the corporate media failing to do its job? </TEXT>

I'd also add to those reading, I've found speaking *with* younger humans, at their own pace, following their leads/tangents works a lot better than talking *to* them.

	<TEXT> I realize you're offering this point because it's made by more entrenched telecoms. So this isn't directed at you, but them. Sonic.net is awesome! :)

I'd humbly counter with the point that the public right-of-ways, tax incentives and the lifting of many if not all wired telecomm regulations for mobile   broadband to "let them innovate" could be seen as corporate welfare. 

There are good reasons for these give-aways, but the beneficiaries can't now turn around and say, "**WE** built this. Now leave us alone to extract our lushly Oligopolic rents, proles!" :)

They benefited from their status as protected entities. They can't now grab all the profits as though they didn't, in other words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This question is more for Cory, given his great books featuring chronologically-challenged humans, but if anyone would like to respond, that'd be great.

OK. Kids. By which, Tweens thru High School, maybe college.

On one hand, they've embraced The Social quite a lot. Digital even more. Not as many as I'd like are aware specifically of how invasive commercial surveillance is, especially how all the technologies work with each other to create profiles broader than kids might expect. 

I don't want to be a hectoring scold to the kids I know, yet at the same time I hate to see vulnerable people taken advantage of. On the brighter side, many kids are aware, and even more aware now, of how pervasive these techniques are. Example: a lot of kids having candids taken of them now shield their lower faces w/ their hands to stymie Facebook-style face recognition (awesome!)

A) Is there hope or should I be pessimistic of humanity's fate as they become more adult?

B) How do you suggest we reach out to them in accepted, constructive ways, and, what couple techniques would you suggest as Privacy Go-Tos to get them started? Let's narrow it down to On Mobile since that's where they live more.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Follow the link and ask EFF!

The shorter version is ISPs being reclassified as a common carrier so sensible, additional rules could be enforced following a Supreme Court case forcing the change. This moved jurisdiction from the FTC to the FCC. The FTC has rules preventing ISPs from taking advantage of their privileged, oligopoly status to surveil and alter their customers' web traffic in pernicious ways. The FCC required new rules (thus that's where the claim that "nothing has changed" come from). 

ISPs were very sensibly prevented from manipulating customers' internet traffic under FTC jurisdiction. These rules don't exist under FCC jurisdiction. It's *really* important ISPs aren't allowed to manipulate customers' internet traffic: common sense, right? Would *you* want someone else watching and manipulating **all** *your* internet traffic? Why not?

So, your talking point is technically correct. It is also wrong, since the switch from FTC to FCC required a change. It's a misleading talking point foisted by the telecommunications oligopolies. Since they **are** under this new jurisdiction, **new** rules, to ensure ISPs operate under the **same** rules the ISPs happily operated under before, are required. Which the Senate Republicans shot down.

And regards, "only call if you're in a Red State", that's silly. It's one 0.5 minute phone call or fax. And tallies **are** kept. If Congress gets several thousands of calls on this issue, all members are informed and thus warned that the public is watching. It matters.

FWIW, the reason the Senate voted as they did (and only succeeding by a few votes) was because they figured with the RepubliCare going over the falls and the UK Parliament stabbing, they thought no one was watching. The House can't be afforded that luxury.

	<TEXT> There's some fuzziness since there are several Mods and we compromise and work together. But generally, the closer to FLOSS or non-profit is better, but we're not filthy hippies and embrace Capitalism, so for instance I'm okay with Apple, say. Their business is aligned with individual's privacy, creativity and autonomy. Companies like Palantir or Facebook are the opposite. I'd argue Microsoft and the ISPs are pretty close to them. Amazon, also closer. But, see, it's fuzzy.

But on the plus side, I argued that while Amazon may be lower on the privacy spectrum, this is an offer for existing Amazon customers so it's not as though it increases their surveillance. But then again, this would have to increase it at some level since they're tracking participants of the program (see: fuzzy).

Versus, say, Fight For The Future, EFF or Demand Progress pushing something, we'd almost assuredly let through. If not hype. 

But I agree: some situations aren't easy. Appreciate your head's up! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> An /r/Privacy Response To The Senate IPS Vote Rolling Back Our Privacy: Step Up Your Privacy Game Then Bombard Congress With Calls/Faxes (wut?) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-24 02:24:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation put it so well, [Senate Puts ISP Profits Over Your Privacy](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/senate-puts-isp-profits-over-your-privacy)

This is not good. It's awful. As the EFF notes,

The Senate just voted to roll back your online privacy protections. [Speak up now](https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy) to keep the House from doing the same thing.

ISPs have been lobbying for weeks to get lawmakers to repeal the FCCs rules that stand between them and using [even creepier ways](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections) to track and profit off of your every move online. Republicans in the Senate just voted 50-48 (with two absent votes) to approve a Congressional Review Action resolution from Sen. Jeff Flake whichif it makes it through the Housewould not only roll back the FCCs rules but also prevent the FCC from writing similar rules in the future.

That would be a crushing loss for online privacy. ISPs act as gatekeepers to the Internet, giving them incredible access to records of what you do online. They shouldnt be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase, and more without your consent.

We can still kill this in the House: [call your lawmakers today](https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy) and tell them to protect your privacy from your ISP.

Do this. Do this now. It's really important since under new Republican rules, once a FCC regulation is defeated (even by only two votes, as this was, in a time when everyone's focus was diverted by the UK Parliament attack and the House vote to kill the ACA), it can never be brought up again (*totally* not shady!). That means, once we've had a chance to catch our breath and realize what a bad idea this is, too bad. How do you like *them* democracy apples?

______

In the meantime, there are several things we can do here at /r/Privacy.

**Your ISP Is Now Part Of Your Threat Profile  Respond By Using A VPN**

VPNs block your traffic and activity from your ISP. What may have arguably been a luxury seems less so. As always, we strongly recommend /u/ThatOnePrivacyGuy's excellent [Guide To Choosing The Best VPN](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/choosing-the-best-vpn-for-you/)

**Educate Yourself On Privacy Tactics**

[Our Peerless /r/Privacy FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/index) and [the /r/PrivacyToolsIO Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/wiki/index) are great starting resources. 

/r/PrivacyToolsIO gives more hands-on advice [for fans of the site](https://privacytoolsio.github.io/privacytools.io/). 

Check them out if you haven't already.

**Share Your Knowledge With Your Fellow /r/Privacy Subscribers**

u/throwaaya9999292282e asked, What is the most encrypted (TCP/IP and DNS) set up someone can run while still being usable?

* What modem?

* What router?

* What firmware for that router?

* What DNS networks?

* Browser extensions?

* Other software?

So, add your suggestions below (no VPN ones since these recommendations are barred). 

And please, *please*, click the above links to call your House Representatives. Or Fax. 

Yeah, I know. Olds! But it's what they track. So, call, fax or write. Tweets don't cut it.

**Breaking:** The EFF just posted an article concerning the upcoming House of Representatives vote: 

[House Schedules Vote on Eliminating Consumer Online Privacy Rights Next Week  Majority Leader McCarthy Confirms House to Immediately Act on Behalf of the Cable and Telephone Industry Following the Senate Vote](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/congress-debates-reversing-course-decades-consumer-privacy-protections)

_____

**Breaking2:** The EFF is having an IAMA **this** Monday, starting at 9:00 AM PST, to get privacy advocates to call their Congressperson to vote against this bill. 

Theyve lined up a great roster of notable experts in the field:

 Cory Doctorow (Blogger, journalist, author, co-editor Boing Boing)

 Dane Jasper (CEO   co-founder, Sonic.net)

 David Segal (Executive Director, Demand Progress)

 Jeremy Gillula (Senior Staff Technologist, Electronic Frontier Foundation)

[The link is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/). Though it doesn't start until Monday, we encourage anyone to post questions before then. Then of course participate on Monday. </TEXT>

I agree, those people smugly saying "We all knew this since FOREVER" are really annoying. It's also a propaganda technique to bury news.

But yeah: The Intercept and Snowden's proofs highlighted this. And, getting to the point of my post, had Wikileaks acknowledged this, building on it instead of claiming it's breaking news, Assange would be less annoying to me. It's the hype-y aspects of most of what Assange does lately that grate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, of course it is. But since woman *always* have to consider the consequences, it isn't part of the baggage surrounding the poll question. Then once stripped of this context, the question can be read as more, "Should women have agency in their sexual activities or are they fetus factories?" to those of a Conservative bent. 

I'm betting the 20% of the "no" response for the woman question are due to that, whereas the 22% of the "no" for the men question are due to respondents thinking men need to be responsible when they use their willies.

Exaggerated somewhat to point out how the results shift when "men" and "women" are part of the question, of course. </TEXT>

Apple vs FBI is a great example of this. The government can't order a private company to create a leaky product resulting in that company's harm. It'd be insane for them to even try. So what did they do? They *tried* to use writs to get around this. Then tried tying it in a neat little NSL bow to prevent the company from screaming, "You're INSANE!" to the world, to shine a light on this reprehensible attack on proper constraints on intrusive government actions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, Windows is closed source and commercial as well so I'm not sure what difference it would make to the Windows user.

[The company seems legit to {the poster} and when asked {the poster} didn't edit the name out so we could discuss why commercial OSs are a legitimate thing to discuss while commercial, closed source solutions to privacy risks are not]

But a lot of people (gods help them) use Windows 10. We'd be remiss (and be one of those annoying, preachy Subs) if we only allowed Trisquel-related questions on /r/Privacy. AND CODE YOUR OWN DAMN DEVICE DRIVERS!

And, we're not that kind of Sub :)

So, OSs are okay to discuss since we're trying to support people where they are. And as I noted, it was removed with no animosity towards you or the company.

I will add, as a *personal* opinion (some of my fellow mods amiably disagree), that there are commercial OSs whose revenue model actually depends on, you know, selling you a computer. Not ads. Not spyware. Not non-anonymized user tracking. For these kinds of operating systems, your and their interests are aligned, not opposed. So [their claims for protecting your privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) are vastly more credible. 

See: honest folks may (amiably) agree to different solutions depending on their threat profiles.

PS: Can you change the mention of the name of the software to "the software" or something generic? Otherwise I'll have to remove it for the same reasons I had to remove your original mention. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, their CS was quick after I sent them an email (thanks again, /u/Boondoc!). They got back to me: 

Thank you very much for being our loyal customer.  All our hard work paid off when you told us you like the Altus T1 :-)

The SHORT warning may come from  moisture conducting electricity, that made the resistance of the CVU chip lower than it is. Dry clean all parts when this happens.

The NO ATOMIZER warning will indicate conduction problem. You did the right thing by cleaning the CVU contact area carefully. You also need to clean the clips, by using fine sand paper (600~800). Try not to clean the CVU with sand paper.

You can order CVU heaters from us. $25 for two. (This may last for years)  

Have a good day.

And, I did get it working after the initial problems after cleaning the contacts (toothbrush   paste). There's also a dry-burn procedure to clean off the carbon that I haven't done yet since the actual burn is fine.

I bought my first Mod and the Altus T1 in Dec, also started making my first batches of juice. So the performance/thriftiness over 34 months is not awful. But I was worried that the CVU might be failing. But, it *is* working. So replacement rates vs traditional coils work out if it's $12 every 6+ (?) months.

So, this newer method makes using a CVU unusual vs. wire coils. It has a different replacement parts/schedule. But so far, okay. The actual burn is fine. The delays that some folks complain about isn't a bother  you just press the button a half-second before your draw. It seems to burn less and is *much* easier to replace only the cotton. Overall, I still like the approach and product.

Thanks for helping. Appreciated!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, so I got the Altus T1, by GuoVape. REALLY snazzy. I like it a lot. Recommend! It is a variable wattage coil that lets you put folds of cotton over a circuit-board heating element, so no yucky wire crimping. 

The package is also nice. A ton of replacement parts (gaskets, cotton, lil' wire things, the works!)

So, not to cast shade on them. I'm really happy.

Except the contacts to the lil' circuit board thingie are wearing and I'd like to see if I can get a replacement. Yet their site has one of those age-check things, that blocks me from accessing anything because they messed it up (at least on Safari and Firefox). I'd like to send their support folks a question, How do I get a replacement board thing?

Any ideas? I tried support@guovape.com but it bounced.

Thanks. And again, I'm not slogging on GuoVape. They're smaller so this slipped thru. But I like how they're innovating. </TEXT>

On the White Houses motives:

The Government appropriately cautions that, in determining purpose, courts should not look into the veiled psyche and secret motives of government decision-makers and may not undertake a judicial psychoanalysis of a drafters heart of hearts.

The Government need not fear. The remarkable facts at issue here require no such impermissible inquiry.

For instance, there is nothing veiled about this press release: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.

Nor is there anything secret about the Executives motive specific to the issuance of the Executive Order:

Rudolph Giuliani explained on television how the Executive Order came to be. He said: When [Mr. Trump] first announced it, he said, Muslim ban. He called me up. He said, Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally. </TEXT>

Data provided by the Department of Homeland Security shows that searches of cellphones by border agents has exploded, growing fivefold in just one year, from fewer than 5,000 in 2015 to nearly 25,000 in 2016.

According to DHS officials, 2017 will be a blockbuster year. Five-thousand devices were searched in February alone, more than in all of 2015.

This is why when the CBP rolls out "voluntary" demands for "some" social accounts and passwords, we must object then fight these demands, legally and technically.

Also, somewhere around 70% of the US population lives within 300(?) miles of the border and their warrantless jurisdiction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Logically, NZ should be able to charge and extradite a US national if they hosted a bit torrent stream of IP owned by a NZ TV production company, say. But imagine the frantic outcry and diplomatic efforts that would erupt if that happened. Especially if as a preemptive attack, the NZ gov't seized all of the American's bank accounts to prevent him being able to afford a lawyer.

It just seems Crazy.

Not that I'm a fan of (alleged) criminal activity. But the law is supposed to be neutral and fair (insert cynical laugh here).

	<TEXT> I was struck by this:

The US did this in bulk under the PRTT Internet dragnet program from 2004 to 2011, and now conducts similar metadata collection overseas (as well as  in more targeted fashion  under PRISM). Mind you, the Russians got far more types of metadata than the US did under the PRTT program.

account users names; recovery email accounts and phone numbers, which users provide to webmail providers, such as Yahoo, as alternative means of communication with the provider; password challenge questions and answers; and certain cryptographic security information associated with the account, i.e. the accounts nonce

But this likely gives you an understanding of the kinds of things the US does collect overseas, as well as via the PRISM program.

So the Russian hackers were charged for US crimes for things they did in Russia. Let's exclude the boner-pill ad hacks and focus on things intelligence agencies do. Let's also exclude the fact that one of these hackers is facing treason charges so he won't be extradited. Let's assume the others might be.

1) How can a US court rule a foreign national committed a crime outside the US then bring them here. Kind of like Kim DotCom, it seems weird that a government can use international warrants to bring a suspect to a jurisdiction where something is criminal, when it isn't criminal when the crime was committed. Charging them in Russian (or New Zealand) courts for these crimes seems more fair.

2) If an act is criminal in both jurisdictions, then extradition makes more sense. Yet still, why not charge them there?

Both of these asked without malice: honestly curious - what's the ethical justification for this, or is this just an example of the US muscling over these concerns?

3) Again ignoring the boner-pill pushing, the (very bad!) hacking is something US, Chinese, British and Russian entities do. So if it's illegal for Russians to do this to US firms, would it be similarly illegal for Americans to do it to European or Asian firms (or even American firms on servers located there)? That is, why aren't these other nations filing charges for US intelligence community staff doing this to them, and filing an international extradition order to bring them to China, Russia or France?

Don't get me wrong. Hacking Yahoo! is really bad. But I'm curious of the rationalization of the US acting as it does, and wondering why other countries don't do the same thing, only targeting US citizens working for American entities. I'd imagine quite a fracas erupting if they tried.

Anyone versed on how international laws and prosecutions work care to explain? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So it seems the Vault 7 cache isn't as significant as Assange claimed and that many if not all of the vulnerabilities are addressed.

Members of the security community have dismissed Assanges hyperbole around the CIA files  collectively nicknamed Vault 7  which he described as exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective.

Ryan Kalember, SVP of Cybersecurity Strategy at Proofpoint, disagreed. Theres nothing earth-shattering, he said, pointing out that many of the operating systems mentioned in the documents are quite old and have already been updated.

It seems like the CIA was doing the same stuff cybersecurity researchers do, which is compile lists of vulnerabilities and try to figure out which ones are being exploited in the wild and which ones could be.

Its not clear at this point how many, if any, of the vulnerabilities are genuine zero-days  those not yet known to vendors, named after the number of days they have to fix them.

Kalember said that the so-called Weeping Angel hack, which uses malware to spy on Samsung smart TVs, has been shown at security conferences for a couple of years and requires physical access to the device.

The CIA should be embarrassed that they lost control of this cache, but they should also be embarrassed if this is their level of technical sophistication, said another another security researcher, who did not want to be named. What they have is pretty unimpressive.

Both said that the vulnerabilities detailed in the documents are likely to have already been patched by the companies. Apple and Google have both publicly stated this is the case 

But to Assange's credit, this time Wikileaks is approaching the companies privately instead publishing them publicly:

The fact that Julian Assange is offering to selectively disclose vulnerability information to affected companies is better than revealing it to all and sundry, but it depends on the veracity, accuracy and currency of that information, said BullGuard CEO Paul Lipman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Facebook and Instagram have banned developers from using their data for surveillance with a new privacy policy that civil rights activists have long sought to curb spying by law enforcement.

Following revelations last year that police departments had gained special access to the social networks to track protesters, Facebook, which owns Instagram, announced on Monday that it had updated its rules to state that developers could not use data obtained from us to provide tools that are used for surveillance.

The news is a victory for civil liberties groups, which have increasingly raised concerns about mass surveillance and aggressive prosecutions of activists under Donald Trumps administration.

Its very important right now that tech companies like Facebook take a stand to be human rights champions, because otherwise theyll be used to violate human rights, said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, part of a coalition that pushed for the anti-surveillance reforms. 

As skeptical as I am about Facebook  LOTS!  any company this large making a public statement is a good thing.

I'd be *very* interested in the details, however. Since that's where all the devils reside.

Also, [Twitter blocked gov't "spy centers" from accessing user data](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/twitter-dataminr-user-data-aclu), starting in Dec '16. 

And for context, [ACLU found in Oct '16 that social media sites gave data to company tracking black protesters such as Black Lives Matter](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/aclu-geofeedia-facebook-twitter-instagram-black-lives-matter). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The proposed act takes the language and concepts used by conservatives to limit abortions and swaps the sexes.

It calls for a $100 fine for emissions outside of a womans vagina, or created outside of a health or medical facility, which will be considered an act against an unborn child, and failing to preserve the sanctity of life.

It also requires the creation of a masturbatory assistance registry of not-for-profit organisations and hospitals able to provide fully-abstinent encouragement counseling, supervising physicians for masturbatory emissions, and storage for the semen.

Considering how many spermatozoa  AKA potential humans  are lost per unsanctioned emission  tens of thousands!  men are clearly a **far** greater threat! </TEXT>

And, they ran the diagnostics in front of you after you asked? Right?

I have friends with sensitive information and they wipe their hard drive, knowing they'll have to restore it afterwards. That's okay too. I have friends who work at labs where they're mandated to remove their hard drives before letting them leave their secured areas. That's okay, too. The correct answer is always, "It depends".

	<TEXT> Hey, OP, to improve discussion, you might want to take the summary info from Amazon for the two books and paste it here. Some folks don't click links, others don't like Amazon, still others want to minimize their being tracked.

And for other readers, what are some great books out there on privacy in general? I like 

* Glenn Greenwald's [No Place To Hide](http://www.glenngreenwald.net) as a go-to.  
* Naomi Klein's [No Logo](http://www.naomiklein.org/no-logo) is another.  
* Noam Chomsky's [Manufacturing Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) was prescient.  
* Marshall McLuhan's [Medium Is The Message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medium_Is_the_Massage) (the [PDF is here](http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf), originally from [Understanding Media,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media) likewise.  

It's not enough to realize we *want* to be more private at times. It's important to know *why* it's vital to humans, intrinsically. And what forces work against that. So, any titles that provide this foundation might help our emerging OP student of personal spaces and privacy. So, g'head and mention some other great books!

	<TEXT> Because part of privacy is a threat assessment and striking the right balance.

I've taken my iDevices to Apple for repairs  several times they repaired out-of-warrantee items gratis, which is pretty awesome  and I used to do support, so I have an understanding of what they're doing. It's pretty slick.

But they need to test the entire system, including the boot-related ones (hey, cramped spaces, long queues, too much coffee (man), stuff happens).

Why? Because the end-user doesn't boot off a Flash drive when they take it home. So they need to reproduce how the device is used before releasing it to the customer. That's good service.

Besides, they run the diagnostics on the Genius Bar table, with you watching.

Now, granted, if you're with the State Department (etc.), your threat profile is different. So then you call in a different service besides Apple. *Shrug.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In 2016, money politics and power-for-money deals had controlled the presidential election, which was full of lies and farces, its introduction says. There were no guarantees of political rights, while the public responded with waves of boycott and protests, giving full exposure of the hypocritical nature of US democracy

The reports authors decry a widening income gap, deteriorating race relations, the repeated shooting of black Americans by white police and Americas worrisome treatment of children, women and the elderly 

Remember those halcyon days of yore  well, six weeks ago  when we could confidently chuckle at one-party China haranguing us about civil rights, corrupt leaders using the government to enrich their immediate family and treating their internal minorities horribly? Their xenophobic scapegoating? And how their leaders would blurt out the most nonsensical, self-contradicting things?

How we'd guffaw. Again, only louder.

Yeah Good times, those. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the article:

R. Scott Moxleys award-winning investigative journalism has touched nerves for two decades. An angry congressman threatened to break Moxleys knee caps. A dirty sheriff promised his critical reporting was irrelevant and then landed in prison. Corporate crooks wont take his calls. Murderous gangsters mad-dogged him in court. The U.S. House of Representatives debated his work. Pusillanimous cops have left hostile messages using fake names. Federal prosecutors credited his stories for the arrest of a doctor who sold fake medicine to dying patients. And a frantic state legislator literally caught sleeping with lobbyists sprinted down state capital hallways to evade his questions in Sacramento. Moxley has won Journalist of the Year honors at the Los Angeles Press Club and been named Distinguished Journalist of the Year by the LA Society of Professional Journalists.

*The OC Weekly* has likewise won numerous awards.

They're both legit, in other words. A lot of really great reporting comes from independent weeklies like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its the latest GOP effort to roll-back Obama-era rules protecting consumers.

The nation's largest broadband companies, including Comcast, AT T and Verizon, hate federal rules approved last year that require them to obtain "opt-in" consent before using, sharing, or selling private consumer data.

For the last several months, the broadband industry has been furiously lobbying the Federal Communications Commission and lawmakers in Congress to kill the privacy policy. As it turns out, two dozen Republican senators are more than willing to oblige and do the bidding of these corporate giants.

Sen. Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican, introduced a resolution on Tuesday that would roll back the FCC's privacy policy, drawing howls of protest from consumer privacy watchdogs. And because Flake is deploying a rarely-used legislative vehicle called the Congressional Review Act, which cannot be filibustered, there is virtually nothing Democrats can do to stop him
