	<TEXT> Yep. I was a fan of the idea of a shorter season because I think there's a lot of fat that can be cut from a 12-episode season. 

But they really should have went the True Detective route when it comes to doing eight episodes. Eight would have been perfect. I would have liked to see more with Neil and what his journey was like. Use one episode on Charlie and flashbacks. I loved the idea of what they were doing in remembering Charlie. I also love the Northwestern flashback and how that worked out. I liked the episode itself - I just didn't like that it was the final episode of the show. It would have been a great next to last episode. 

Still, great show and great season.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Picking between Bear Bryant and Nick Saban as the greatest coach in school history is a great problem to have.

I'm with you though. Along with 3 titles in 4 years, he's done it in an era with limited scholarships, more media attention for all programs (thus more competition) and in an SEC that won six straight national titles. SEC was good in Bear's years, but it's nothing like it has been from 2003-on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tough choice between Dan Devine and Gary Pinkel. Devine won an Orange and a Sugar Bowl with the Tigers. He later won a national title at Notre Dame. 

Part of me wants to pick Pinkel, though. Five 10-win seasons, 5 conference division titles in two different conferences and inherited a down program and made it one of the Top 15 if you look at total wins since 2007. Mizzou hasn't made a BCS bowl under Pinkel, but they've finished in the Top 5 twice when looking at the postseason poll.  </TEXT>

I'd also put Jimmy Johnson over Erickson as a Miami coach. He kept it rolling and I thought Erickson was a guy who was in the right place at the right time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Miami's 5 national titles in 18 years are amazing, but they were just a few plays away from winning 9. 

* 1986: Testaverde throws 5 interceptions and Miami only loses by 4. 
* 1988: Miami gets jobbed against Notre Dame on a fumble call at the goal-line. 
* 2000: Miami gets screwed by the BCS. 
* 2002: The pass interference call. 

That would have been nine national titles in 18 years. Amazing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We'll see. If Alabama wins tomorrow as they should, Bama will be a big favorite. 

It reminds me of the set-up of the 1996 Big 12 title game. Nebraska, currently in a dynasty, played a two-loss Texas team that year that won a ton of ugly games to win a weak division. Texas had no pressure on them in the game and played with house money. 

We know what happened. 

Now, I think Bama's clearly a better team. But Any Given Saturday.  </TEXT>

You can either get a stud wide receiver like Amare Cooper or trade down for some draft picks. Derek Carr has had a good season considering the overall season the team has had. This year's draft class is looking solid and the Raiders should have money to spend next year. 

Let's use these final six games to play younger guys and get them reps for next year. 

Let's also hope the 49ers/Harbaugh situation explodes and Jim hops on over to the East Bay. He's taken over lousy programs/teams and has built them up over his career.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Kansas City, so I've seen a lot of Chiefs games this season. 

The keys:

- Make Alex Smith beat you. Alex Smith is a good quarterback, but the Chiefs have been at their best when Jamaal Charles and Knile Davis have carried the team on offense. On top of that, the Chiefs don't have any deep threats. Contain Charles and the rushing attack and the Raiders have a puncher's chance. I think Alex Smith is capable of putting the Chiefs on his back (he did in the playoffs last year), but make him do it. 

- No turnovers. Last year, the Raiders turned the ball over seven times against the Chiefs. I think this Chiefs team is a lot better than last year's version. That's not gonna cut it against a playoff team. They've also had numerous, killer turnovers over the years against the Chiefs when they've played on the west coast. 

- Special teams. The Chiefs have been very solid on special teams returns this season. De'Anthony Thomas is due to break one. Let's hope it's not against the Raiders. To win, the Raiders need to win the field advantage battle. 

- Find ways to get to Smith. The two games Smith has really struggled in this year happened because the defense got to him big time. Whether it's winning the battles up front or calling creative blitz schemes, rattle him and knock the Chiefs' offense off rhythm. They don't have sexy stats, but the offense is efficient.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the outside, I've never understood why a segment of the Miami fans hated Al Golden. 

I can see why after tonight. That team played scared in the second half and was way too conservative. I know he inherited a bad situation, but that team shouldn't have four losses. I'm not saying they should be a national title contender, but they have 8-2 or 9-1 talent instead of 6-4 talent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seattle at KC. If the Seahawks play strong and win at Arrowhead, they might be "back on track" to defending their title. It would be their best win of the season.

If the Chiefs win, they'd have victories against New England, Miami, Seattle and San Diego. You'd have to consider them Super Bowl contenders IMO. 

I think both teams are even and it feels like it'll be a great game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very good episode. I'm curious as to how they'll be able to wrap up everything in just six episodes. 

If I were to predict how this goes, I think Neal's contact pulls a Snowden and reveals himself over seas and that saves him. I also think the network gets sold and the finale is similar to the Mary Tyler Moore Show.  </TEXT>
