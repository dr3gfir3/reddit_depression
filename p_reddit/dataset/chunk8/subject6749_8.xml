	<TEXT> This was in Georgia about 9 years ago and I was waiting on the side of the highway for the bus, broke as fuck and just trying to get home to my then boyfriends moms house. This was the first time I had ever been in Georgia, let alone the first time that I had been out of my home state for sure. There was a tropical storm that was battering down on Georgia at the time, not enough to be a hurricane, but close. Regardless, I was soaked on the side of the road. There was this one car that stopped and instead of being creepy or anything dangerous at all, she throws open her trunk and pulls out a giant umbrella and just gives it to me. One could not tell wether my face was wet from rain or tears of joy but it made me so happy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was 15 or 16 I had "friends" that abused me. I think I was so desperate for a group of friends but it was always dark and cruel. I even ended up in the E.R once with a wound from a blunt force to my elbow which left my bone exposed. I lied to my dad at the time as to what happened to protect both my "friend" and myself from said person. I am now 29 and this still affects my daily life even if on small scales. I wish I had more courage back then.  </TEXT>
