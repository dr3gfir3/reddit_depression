	<TEXT> The scale might fool you but without too much force this juicy piece fits perfectly in my mouth (might have a large one). There is no extra in the burger, only the ketchup, mustard and onion then 2x 110 gram beef burgers. The bun i brioche so it's very airy So uncompressed the burger is around 8-9 cm and compressed around 6-7 cm. 

No fork and knife needed. 

On the classic part i maybe should have written "classic double cheeseburger" ;)
