	<TEXT> Here's the thing, I live in southern California and Latinos do commit a disproportionate amount of the violence in my community. It is not the ones who moved here as adults because they are working to provide for their families but their sons and daughters often get pulled into a Chicano gang culture that normalize violence to such an extent that one young man will stab another young man just like him to death simply over which side of the main street his family lives.

So you can take this info and write a study that shows the immigrants causing less crime than citizens born here without truly taking into account how much crime is caused by immigration.

Studies at best serve as flawed indicators when dealing with complex issues especially when many of these studies tend to be authored by university professors that would forever be labeled as "the racist professor" if they say something offensive. </TEXT>

Well you could use logic, fact, and reason to demonstrate how bad the GOP is, you know, like an adult?

You will never win anyone over to your side by calling them stupid, you win them over by showing them truth. Over and over and over.

The right wingers have a very well funded lie machine and if the main thing working class white males see from the left is "you are evil for being white, horrible for being male, and ignorant for being uneducated" then who will they vote for? </TEXT>
