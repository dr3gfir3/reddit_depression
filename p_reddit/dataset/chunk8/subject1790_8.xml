	<TEXT> All I took from that is that Spencer and his supporters are losers in fringe online communities who got screwed over and won't admit how decent people don't agree with them 

Also Spencer sounds like he gives rambling speeches blaming everything but himself. It didn't seem like he was even pulling on a consistent thread. The loser should pay attention to populist races around the country and how bad they bombed when the candidate wasn't Trump  </TEXT>

As for trading down you need to have a pick people want; still think that's a big reason we took ebron instead of trading down. I'd like to trade down if all the really good defensive players are gone but if not I'd be fine with Corey Davis. He makes our wr corps set for several years </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd agree. The dnc strategy of late has seemed to concentrate solely on cities. Expansion should be viewed by attempting to spread out towards the suburbs or at least that seems like a logical path for them.

	<TEXT> I transplanted away from a small town to a large metro area but I think you are underselling the difficulty of doing something like that in modern times. That was why I brought up telecommuting. Even though it seems like it would help engage rural Americans in work it did the opposite and massively benefited cities.

I guess the question is how do you spur growth in areas where most of the population is older or willing to leave. Do you encourage them to relocate? We used to encourage people to do that for work

	<TEXT> Telecommuting has not made towns grow. It's only been a boon for cities. So why would someone want to uproot themselves just to bust their ass to make an area they have no connection to better? 

Edit: also unless they are independently wealthy this carries great personal risk as small towns did back Trump partly due to desperation. They don't have opportunities and those who can leave frequently do. While a lot of it is self inflicted it still is ignoring that these towns don't have a lot going for them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I grew up in a rural area. The work some of those guys did you would not get a person to do. Npr reported a while back on migrant workers at vineyards knowing what to look for and how to take care of the plant. That takes time to learn. 


Interesting enough is that longer farming equipment came from non migrants working in the field. 


As far as crime.
