	<TEXT> WTF is going this week?

* There was this sarin attack on civilians in Syria

* 60 Cruise missiles rained down on a Syrian military airport where the chemical attack was launched

* Then there is goddam guy on truck mowing down some children in Sweden 

* And now this - bombing near two Coptic churches on Palm Sunday in Egypt with dozens killed and many more injured. 

* And the St. Petersburg subway bombing where 14 died and dozens injured 

It's frigging depressing week...

Edit: Omitted St Petersburg bombing.. sorry Moscow! ;(   (Hat Tip to u/Havocb)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In order for him to gain access to the countrys best-kept secrets, the presidents son-in-law was required to report all contacts he had with foreign government officials over the **past seven years.** Kushner, however, omitted dozens of meetings, including ones with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., and Sergey Gorkov, the head of Russias state-owned Vnesheconombank

 Kushners lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, is calling the omissions an error. Gorelick said that Kushner simply submitted the forms prematurely and immediately requested the opportunity to provide additional information.

Is it safe to say that it wasn't ignorance or error on his part. That he knew the procedure and he conveniently omitted them... over 7 years? </TEXT>

This kind of anti-consumer, anti-privacy action doesnt benefit anyone except large corporations. This is not an abstract threat to regular folks  this is bad policy with real world consequences. The legislation I have introduced will ensure these actions never make it to New York State.

	<TEXT>  Duterte, 72, whose first marriage was annulled and who is in a long-term relationship with another woman, Honeylet Avancena, has openly boasted about having mistresses and using Viagra to have sex with them.

 Who isnt entitled to happiness? Ask these lawmakers, how many of them have two, three or four mistresses? Ask them, Duterte said on Sunday in his first public comments on the Alvarez controversy.

 Dutertes defence of adultery smacks of a double standard, said Elizabeth Angsioco, national chairwoman of the Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines.

 These are men in positions of power so its unacceptable and appalling that they just speak lightly of these things. Its very dangerous, Angsioco added.

This man is the President of the Philippines and was a popular vote in the last general election. He is embolden by his initial popularity (maybe he still is highly regarded by the people) and the shit he says and does is unlikely to be seriously challenged by anyone openly without having a Drug Swat Team outside your front door!   </TEXT>

 "Just because you're a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you're a son of a bitch," he said.

 He has also described Jun Pala, a journalist who was murdered in the southern city of Davao in 2003 when Duterte was mayor there, as a "rotten son of a bitch".
