	<TEXT>  I don't think that is what a good day is, you did your best and helped someone and that is awesome. But good days aren't days you find out that one wrong move on your part might have ended in someone else's suicide.


Hearing that someone didn't commit suicide because of what you personally made an effort to do doesn't make for a good day?  You have some ultra high standards there, pal.

One wrong move on my part wouldn't have ended up with someone committing suicide unless that wrong move was saying, "hey fuck it man.  We're better off without you.  Here's a gun and a shit load of vodka."

People thinking like this keeps them from helping out sometimes.... ANd that's counterproductive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Partially responsible.  After handing them off to clinicians and a broader support network, it's not 100% on me (legally).  But, I've always been taught (by parents, and personal beliefs) that I am my brother's keeper.  So.. no change, really. </TEXT>

Adverse work actions are a major cause of depression and stress.  Keep an eye on yourself, and please don't be afraid to reach out to people you know/trust if needed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of these could be objective signs of depression, rather than a suicidal person.  There are lots of people who are depressed, but not all of whom are suicidal.

Many times, suicidal people fly under the radar.  Sometimes, they are the person you described who suddenly becomes happy, starts giving away their things, starts speaking in terms of "after they're gone," and so forth.

A *HUGE* contributing factor is alcohol, and a big red flag is sudden withdrawal from an otherwise normal life or from hobbies you know the person used to love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both.  Relayed my story of what happened to me in similar situations, and the struggles I went through.  Also constantly constantly reiterated confidentiality, and went to a therapist with him and waited outside while he went for the first few visits.

Essentially, broke down the stigma, on a personal basis, related to reaching out for help.  And really proved to him, and others, that I (and many other people) actually give a shit. </TEXT>
