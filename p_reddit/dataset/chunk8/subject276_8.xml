	<TEXT> No, I don't think Zlatan being benched is because you're going for Europa. Why would you bench your top performing player when you're still fighting for top 4, and against Chelsea of all teams? Jose himself said if it's still mathematically possible to make top 4 and he plays his second team, he thinks the fans would kill him.  It just does not make sense. </TEXT>
