	<TEXT> I think this feud has been a bit under the radar (fair enough considering Wrestlemania and all), but for some reason i've just really enjoyed this feud, especially its slow burn. Maybe it's cause i'm a big fan of both guys and dont want either to fade away inbto obscurity that i've become so invested, but it also just feels like a nice change up from what is otherwise turning into a draining experience (frustrations with bookings etc) in the main event scene.

Anyway i haven't really got anythign to say about the feud other than just wanting to talk about it, so if any of you have been watching it, any ideas where it might go? It feels like a pretty unique feud and I get the feeling they might end up in a tag team similar to Sheamus/Cesaro </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i was really hyped and excited for the trailer, but i felt the exact same way, at least with the final scare that you mentioned. A lot of good in the trailer, but not a lot of scare.
Still hopeful though! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cmon Mate you don't have to be a cunt about it. They weren't being an asshole at all. they were giving a pretty valid response to something that realistically not many people care for at all. It's not like they insulted all of Australia by commenting on something no.one uses unless you're in year 5 or think that people who don't like Australia "should.go home". I literally could give no fucks about the phrase

	<TEXT> Hahah good point! :P 
but yeah it would obviously provide some cushioning and general protection from strikes as well (all while counter-actively making your head a bigger target ironically)  </TEXT>
