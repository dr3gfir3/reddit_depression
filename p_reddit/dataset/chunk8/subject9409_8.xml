	<TEXT> I wouldn't call the Washington Post a ridiculously biased source. It's over 100 years old and doesn't publish fake news pushed by the Russian government.

Your points are valid, just as mine are. 

I'd disagree on militarizing the police, though. He actively tried to stop that and banned the use of military grade vehicles to police departments. He also opened up federal investigations into the police departments of many cities, including Baltimore and Chicago: http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-obama-police-reform-20160809-story.html </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Journalists can help the dems save the country by getting the data to expose him, like the NYT tried to do with a few years of his tax returns.

If you pay $10/month for Netflix or Spotify, you can justify paying $10/month to help destroy Donald Trump. No one is better equipped to do that than the press. We also need non-alternative facts more than ever. 

Washington Post: https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com

The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions

Dallas News: https://join.dallasnews.com/subscribe

The San Francisco Chronicle: https://offers.sfchronicle.com/offers/1-4?groupid=31

The Globe and Mail (I'm biased, but it's business section has been tracking the fallout from Trump's policies really well): https://sec.theglobeandmail.com/subscription/?intcmp=GAMunlimited_sub

The Guardian: https://subscribe.theguardian.com/int/digital

As a subscriber I get to follow the people best equipped to attack Trump and track their progress  the people who will find the sources, the tax returns, and the info to bring him down. Getting more than just the headlines has made me much more able to argue against Trump supporters. It's also just nice to not have to try to "game" the system and steal content by constantly changing browsers, stopping load before interactive elements come in, etc.

	<TEXT> The mission statement tab is one of menu items on the site: https://www.womensmarch.com/mission/ Pretty hard to miss. 

The protest hopes to stop the roll back of womens rights in the US, which Trump seems to want to speed up. The issues range from the right to have an abortion to supreme court picks. 

Everyone at the marches supports womens rights and equality, and is anti-Trump. We are all united on those issues. 

Is staying home more effective? Have you ever been to a protest, or do you just criticize them on the internet? 

The purpose of the protests is very clear. You can't deny that - it sounds like you actually disagree with it. You can't be mad about not knowing information something because you didn't look for the information - it's not going to just magically appear in your feed on Reddit.  </TEXT>

The most 'supportive' anyone gets is: "I don't know what they're protesting or what their beliefs are, but I guess protesting is okay." Unbelievable. Like, you can't figure out why women are protesting Trump's sexism? Or are you just dismissing the march even though you do know the purpose? 

I won't regret marching, but I think a lot of people will regret staying silent when Trump takes away their health insurance and public education funding.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a great time to build your community. Early adopters of your business want to be involved from the beginning - you should develop a brand strategy and voice, and then share everything at this point. Early adopters want to be part of your success. If they're with you from the beginning, your customers' brand loyalty will also skyrocket. 

First trainer hired? Share it. First lightbulb turned on? Share it. Location chosen? Share it. Need to choose a paint colour? Ask your Instagram followers. Etc etc etc. 

The setup of your business can create authentic content that isn't spammy. **You have a huge opportunity to capture a local audience now, when you have nothing to sell.** This is a good window to get people to follow you on social.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like Crowdbabble, but I'm biased (I work there). Here's a good summary of our current Instagram analytics: http://crowdbabble.com/instagram-analytics. The ability to schedule reports to your email is what users tend to like the most. 

We're adding new features and an updated design, which you can see here: https://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/new-perspectives-on-social-media-sneak-peek/

The good thing about Crowdbabble is that you can also track accounts on other platforms, so you don't need separate analytics solutions for each one. Rolling up different accounts into one report saves time. If you go with Iconosquare and then need Twitter analytics, you're sort of stuck.  </TEXT>

If so, you should be able to track their posts using most social media analytics options, including Crowdbabble (where I work). 

You'll want to track impressions of the post, engagements, and traffic to your website from social. Crowdbabble can also do more custom reports, like getting a list of the Twitter or Instagram handles of everyone who likes/retweets/replies to a post. You just have to set up tracking before the post goes up.

	<TEXT> Content marketing is a whole lot of noise that you have to sort through to find the good stuff. 

Very little of it works. You can't build a good marketing strategy based off tips and tricks -- you actually need a more holistic approach. Most of listicles on SME or marketing aggregators are written by poorly paid writers in under 2 hours. These people aren't experts in their fields. The content has little to no value. It drives traffic, but over time, it can actually erode the reputation of the publications or brands. 

I eliminated blogspam from my company's blog for this reason. We replaced lists of tips and tricks with in-depth case studies on social media disasters and the election. The idea is that readers can learn from the fails and wins of brands in their categories. More than they would from listicles, hopefully.

In any case, you should be suspicious of content that you don't have to pay for, which is supported only by ad revenue - that means the writers aren't paid well. There is some good content marketing out there but you typically have to dig to find real insights.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Building a community on Instagram will be key for you  not just pushing content, but finding a real way to interact with your followers. You might also consider Facebook Live to differentiate you from other beauty bloggers - stream looks as you do them. 

What are your main competitors doing? That's something else to investigate. 

Before you launch, you might also consider social media analytics. If you sign up for a service before launch, you'll have all your follower data. Almost all services can't capture historical follower/fan data. They can only get it from the moment you sign up onwards. You'll also be able to add your competitors and see what they're doing on social, and what their top posts are.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work for Crowdbabble, so I'm pretty biased toward their social media analytics.

For audience research, the dealership should have a bunch of data on their customers. Their ages, incomes, etc. 

In terms of getting involved in the community, you want to build a community on social media. It could for locals who love XYZ brand cars, for car help, for millenial road trip ideas, whatever. A community is way better than a brand that just pushes links and spam. This wouldn't necessarily cost money initially, and you could build this using your social media strategy. You could spend money on community events and free workshops if you end up going that route. 

With any marketing, you have to answer these fundamental questions:

 * Who is my target audience?
 * Where are they? Where do they congregate online?
 * What do they need?
 * How can I give it to them, using social media?

	<TEXT> Best of luck! I think you're missing the research phase. 

My suggestions:

 * Look at what competitors are doing on social
 * Analyze your audience and target market
 * Look at what best in class brands that cater to that audience are doing on social
 * Get some social media analytics, to track what competitors are doing - pinpoint their top posts, top performing hashtags, etc
 * Use competitor numbers to come up with realistic goals (if average follower growth for all your competitors is 10% per month, that might be a good goal to aim for)
 * Develop content themes based on competitor and audience research
 * Develop a content schedule / calendar

The other bit you're missing is community building. You can't just push content on social media. You need to interact with your fan base, get them involved, develop a community of car lovers in your area.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I try to write case studies on subjects that other people haven't covered. When a brand screws up on social media for example, I actually dig into the stats to see what the effects were. 

If you provide new or original information, you have a chance of actually helping people or providing value. 

Real value + a unique voice are key.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can calculate it a few ways.

Page consumptions / page views



Fans(likes) / people reached

Fans(likes) / impressions

Engagement (reactions, comments, shares) / impressions

Engagement (reactions, comments, shares) / fans

Choose a calculation that matches what you're doing on your other networks, so you can compare them. Engagement / fans is the way that we calculate it, because that can be easily compared across LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram - engagement vs fans or followers.
