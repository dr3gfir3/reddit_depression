	<TEXT> So, um, remember when [I told you about the baby Im gonna have](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5myi34/haha_guys_my_parents_think_im_a_virgin_but_im/?st=iyg3pogo sh=e228bfcc)? Me too, lol. Its gonna be so great. Oh but yeah thats not why Im sad.

You know how my parents arent really ever around and stuff? Yeah, it turns out they like...stopped living? Like a while ago? And Ive been living with foster parents for like a year? 

Haha no jk theyre fine but theyre on vacation lol. Its cool they know how mature I am and let me be alone and watch [my stupid brother](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5c2xzz/ok_now_my_brother_is_all_messed_up_and_gross_lol/?st=ixqaar4v sh=33e9ea48) even though [my dumb sister](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4ho869/um_can_any_of_you_guys_tell_me_whats_wrong_with/?st=ivbamqdh sh=d65e3411) got all dead and stuff. But yeah heres why Im sad. And no, its not [poor gay Kevin](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5i4e1h/omg_guys_why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_a_boyfriend/?st=ixqab4ot sh=30c286c6) (I call him Gaykev now.)

I promised my parents Id go to church on Wednesday night and I did thank you very much. I walked all the way over there and went down all those flights of stairs and sat at mass for five hours until the Gift stopped bleeding. And breathing lol. 

I told some of the other people at church about the baby but it seemed like they already knew about the baby and I was like um okay so why are you asking how Im doing when you know Im awesome because Im having a baby that you already know about for some reason. Yuck. The Hierophant was nice and he gave me a hug once he washed all the Gifts blood off his hands haha I said I didnt mind but he wanted to be polite because I have really pretty hair.

Anyway yesterday I went to talk to Gaykev about the baby and see if he wants to make out or something just to practice because boys have mouths not too different from girls. Not as pretty as mine though lol. Dont send me more messages pervs.

So Gaykevs brain is getting a little better so he drooled pretty intelligently for someone with a lot of missing brain and said something like ummmmmmmmmmfffff when I asked about being a daddy so I took that as a yes and started kissing him. Did you know that drool tastes like a mouth? I guess it kinda makes sense but I never really thought about it but yeah drool is all mouthy.

But guys heres why Im sad: I think Gaykev stayed gay because he didnt really get into it except to drool a lot more. He didnt say ANYTHING about wanting to be Katnisss daddy. I didnt want anyone to think I got rejected so I just pushed him away and said not to touch me anymore. No one noticed. It was nice.

But Im still sad. I dont want Katniss to grow up without a daddy in her life. Sure, that gray man who put Katniss up me is technically her dad and theres always Black God and even my dumb aunt is all about this Bill Lemarie or something guy but its not the same. 

Gaykev is such daddy material. Unf.

Btw my aunt is REALLY annoying. I get it - my uncle was sad and had to go out on a boat and die all slow and stuff. But h*ck, Aunt Lisa, why do you have to be all dramatic about it? Like, we have Gaykevs for that type of thing. Theres really nothing artsy about what you do so how about like you just stop being so drama llamay and just move on lol. Its so not attractive, like, youll never get another uncle for me that way.


Yeah Katniss is kinda pushing at the inside of my eyes now which is kinda cute but tickles a lot and makes stuff blurry for a little while. Its like looking into a glass thats filled with corn syrup or Gaykev drool or something not that I ever collected it and drank it haha.

So yeah one more interesting thing that youre gonna read because you think Im sweet and adorbs. The Hierophant was at my doorstep first thing this morning when I went out to go to school OMG HOLD ON

Guys I totally realized while I was writing this that I hadnt fed Tommy since my parents left and, like, UGH WHY IS IT SO EASY TO ACCIDENTALLY KILL LITTLE KIDS SO ANNOYING.

So the Hierophant was there and he touched my forehead in front of where little Katniss was sleeping and then asked me to take a bite out of something that was kinda cold and meaty and had veins in it. But I felt pretty good after.

Ok I have to go do something about Tommy or else Im going to get in a lot of trouble. But Im not sad anymore now that I got all this out. Ill ttyl losers haha no youre not really losers except for[ all of you](http://unsettlingstories.com) who totally are.

	<TEXT> *Under every scrap of confining skin is the potential for escape. When life grows from your husk, you, in turn, may be reborn.* -William James Lemaire: Seeding the Verdant World

It had been so, so long since my soulmate had felt anything resembling escape. 

We sat and talked about the process that would surely end his life. Our Benefactor, William, had proposed this journey to us at our final meeting. William, whod given so much of his time and energy to the wretched around him, was generous in imparting his wisdom. He believed my soulmate could be saved - but only if he gave his life to the Verdant World. I remember looking at the swaying trees and long grass around us - trees and grass seeded by the numberless Saved. It was a defining moment.

*Grow what we love in whom you love.* -William James Lemaire: Seeding the Verdant World

I kissed the lips of my soulmate before removing them. He didnt move. Tears sprouted from the corners of his closed eyes. The sweet taste of his kiss lingered as I poured honey in and around his new mouth. The honey was from bees which had pollinated the flowers grown from other Saved. The cycle was continuing with us. We whirl the wheel.

The tranquility of the pond was a gift from the Benefactors before William. Birds sang, bees buzzed, crickets chirped, my soulmate bled.

Before each cut, he nodded his assent. I needed to know this was what he wanted. It was. This was the most important moment of his short life - a chance for redemption. A chance to prove he loved the world which birthed him. A chance, finally, to show appreciation after a lifetime of inescapable sadness.

To be sad was to mock the gifts of the Benefactors.

*Float as one, return to shore as many.* -William James Lemaire: Seeding the Verdant World

With my soulmate open and honeyed, I set him adrift on the small raft in the tranquil pond. Birds sang, bees buzzed, crickets chirped, and all lit upon the wounds of my love.

For weeks, I stayed with him on the muddy edge of the pond. Once each morning, I would pull the rope on his raft to bring him to shore. I fed him milk and honey as I inspected his wounds.

His mouth and nostrils bore new life.

His open chest bore new life.

His pierced belly bore new life.

His split thighs bore new life.

During our morning times of closeness, I urged him to speak. His refusals came in the form of a soft gurgling and a shake of his head. Not too hard a shake; he didnt want to disturb that which developed inside him. 

He was growing larger by the day - purple streaks stained his sun-charred skin which now stretched and wept. It wouldnt be much longer.

*On the day of escape, let there be great joy as the air and the water and the soil are rejuvenated. Venerate the husk as you would a flower, for it contains the Seeds of Ignition.* -William James Lemarie: Seeding the Verdant World

My soulmate burst and passed away on the 16th day of his journey. From his body came new life. Eyes that once stared at a world he believed to be bereft of joy now bore sunflowers: proof of the good we had done.

I left him, open to the Verdant World, and went on. 

New birds sang to Black God, new bees buzzed to Black God, new crickets chirped to Black God. 

The wheel remains [whirling](http://unsettlingstories.com).

	<TEXT> Bodies in bodies.

Bodies of bodies.

True knowledge requires self destruction. Id always preached it, but Id never practiced it. Never, until this morning, when the red wire slipped into the black module and I moved while going nowhere. My consciousness - my essence - erupted from my body and left me standing in that busy room of machines and batteries and magic.

(Magic is nothing without machines and batteries.) 

I left my body without looking back. The air was smoky and shimmering. The walls were porous. No sound met my earless nothingness. There was only sight. My third eye; my soul; my angel: my guide. My everything. 

I traversed the room and slipped through the wall. 

I hung over a city street of hideousness and chaos. To see the universe as it truly is, as hideousness and chaos, was to experience great validation. Goodness and order are fleeting aberrations. Chaos overpowers, seething and miasmatic.

A gaping grin gashed the sky above. Through it, shapes poured. 

To travel is to understand shapes that would be invisible and incomprehensible when shackled within a body. Shapes of countless dimensions. Shapes of colors so far beyond natural spectra that they registered as flavors on the tongue Id left behind. Shapes are the devils of our nature.

I floated down to street level. The ground was translucent and fragile. Shapes twisted and writhed through foundational pores, paying no mind to the matter I once believed to be solid. I followed one, a pinched, non-Euclidian phantasm of impossible proportions, into my home.

Inside, my wife sat reading her book. She saw nothing of me. She saw nothing of the shape. A smile of contentment rested on her face as she studied the words on the pages before her. The shape probed her.

She shifted in her chair, as if suddenly uncomfortable. The probing ceased. The shape left her. In its place were three, infinitesimal spots on her right ovary. I traveled forward, into her. The spots began a slow, inexorable metastasis.

Chaos overpowers.

I left her and the room and returned to the street. Shapes swirled in and out of buildings and homes and people. I rose up, over it all, until the city sprawled beneath me like a mirage. The pores of the universe contracted and drooled and gaped as the world I knew continued around it all with contented obliviousness. 

The area near the hospital was packed with ghostly, indescribable things. I traveled toward it and watched as the shapes poured in and out, down and through, up and around. Shapes merged the free-floating bacteria with healthy workers and visitors. Bacterial bodies in human bodies. I passed through the walls and gazed upon the shapes connecting the dead and dying to the newborn and preborn. Newborn bodies of dead bodies.

Bodies in bodies.

Bodies of bodies.

I felt myself being drawn back through the walls and toward my home. I tried to move on my own, but was unable. I passed through the homes of countless people as they went about their lives, entirely oblivious to the forces around them. 

I slipped back into my skull and opened my eyes. Everything was as Id left it. The batteries of my machine no longer contained a charge. I walked downstairs and my wife greeted me with a smile of honest affection. I stared, blankly, at her abdomen, and wept.

Bodies in bodies.

	<TITLE> Far Too Many Tunnels </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-20 16:56:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Related.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/comments/540udh/runners_usubject3642/?st=iy4jj7ob sh=a641754a)

I know this is going to mean almost nothing to you. There are concepts and systems mentioned in here that will be entirely alien. But theyll all be revealed soon. 

There are two kinds of [tunnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4kuldv/far_too_little_courage/?st=iy5zi13m sh=e98cf76c): high-level tunnels (HLT) and low-level tunnels (LLT). HLT are what we used to instantaneously transport physical matter from one point to another, like hemoengineered blood to [blood banks and hospitals](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4iqn1a/far_too_much_blood/?st=iy5zip4w sh=66db7853). Theyre stable and long-lived, they use less energy than one might think, and they leave no traces that anyone without our technological sophistication can detect. All one needs is to do is set location data into the systems, define which points are to be linked, and activate them.

LLT are different. They originate here, but they terminate somewhere else. Their overall properties are unknown at this point. Aida is the only one with the ability to create and use them, and she is not forthcoming with the details of their operation. She did, however, leave one open. I think she did it to tease us. And that scares me.

We couldnt leave it alone - we had to investigate. Wed never seen one before; just glimpses of the residue from ones thatd slammed shut right after theyd been detected. 

[Bill over at SIGINT](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4j7oz8/far_too_much_distortion/?st=iy5zkt30 sh=450dddeb) said to send a drone in, which seems to be his answer to everything, but I couldnt think of a compelling reason to go with anything manned. Even the [respirocyte](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4k36fu/far_too_little_air/?st=iy5zjdha sh=22842f0a) volunteers could wait until the drone did some tests.

Around noon, we sent the drone in. Right away, we got back video.

I dont know why we thought it would be space. Whenever someone mentioned the tunnels, I thought about a wormhole like in the movies with distorted space and stars and energy and all that. 

This couldnt have been more different.

The drone moved through a cavernous, fleshy tube full of reddish slime and flying, insect-like creatures that looked very much like large, [black houseflies](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4iwchu/far_too_many_flies/?st=iy5zjsto sh=9ed96010). The tube was perforated with countless holes, each hole branching off into similar tubes with the same features. It appeared to be a vast, interconnected network. 

At the end of the tube the drone occupied was an aperture. We directed it to move straight at it, and once it was touched, the aperture slid open and exposed an alien environment.

There were [mushroom](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/47k6x1/slough_part_1_of_2/?st=iy5zkdtl sh=98a45b27)-like organisms of every conceivable shape and size. And there were things moving among them. Terrible, indescribable things. The drone feed cut out.

We analyzed every frame of video for days. We attempted to query Aida for assistance, but she maintained her usual silence about anything LLT related. Shed given us enough by leaving the tunnel open. It was obvious she wanted us to see something. We just couldnt tell what it was we were seeing.

Look, Ill come right out and say it: we all knew there were aliens out there. The [Unknown 6s.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4kuldv/far_too_little_courage/?st=iy5zlht1 sh=281ad8aa) We knew that the technology we were playing with would get the attention of whoever was out there. We held seminars about potential xenobiology and contact scenarios. All that. But despite all the preparations, its obvious weve entered a situation we cant control.

For example:

An [ovoid](http://unsettlingstories.tumblr.com/post/143180231881/3d-printing) has shown up in western Pennsylvania. Its hovering over a lake in the middle of nowhere. A park ranger happened to notice it and alerted the authorities, but we were able to intervene and put the area under our command. So far, there havent been leaks. One of our cameras caught it scanning and disassembling a bear.

The food and drug division of AppDyn has inserted MR332d derivatives into many of its [nutritional supplements](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5ox8pe/runners_part_1/?st=iy5v8z0p sh=521f9140). Because supplements are unregulated in many areas, its likely the compound will ingested without raising any alarms. MR332d is the least potent of the delivery vectors, but it is likely not ready for mass dissemination. 

Stars are being occluded. We dont know how. The occlusions are fleeting. Mzuzi, who seems to be the only one Aida talks to nowadays, [went on a hike](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5oj61t/far_too_many_legs/?st=iy5zmz4m sh=74f1a591) after a conversation with her. I feel it may be related to these occlusions. When he comes back, Im anxious to learn what he found. Something tells me he is the key to learning Aidas motivations.

A small town in Syria, already besieged by their civil war, traveled. Every man, woman, child, and animal. A military craft found them spread out over a wide swath of the Pacific ocean. All physical signs pointed to flash freezing, followed by exposure to enormous pressure consistent with a depth of greater than one mile.

Finally, on a personal note, my kids getting sick. Hes getting patches of irritation all over his skin. The doctors saying its eczema, but I think MR332(x) is in the general population now. Not just isolated pockets. And if its everywhere - if Aida has failed at stopping the spread - the other contingency might need to be activated. 

Its this personal reason that compels me to reveal information about AppDyn. I firmly believe weve entered a situation beyond our control.

Maybe beyond anyones control. As I write this, Im being alerted about the presence of another LLT opening [nearby](http://unsettlingstories.com).

Its not easy to organize a marathon. You need to get permits to use the roads, you need to plot out a course, you need to find vendors and sponsors and volunteers and safety professionals and, above all, *runners.*

As shitty as it sounds, the bombing at the Boston marathon helped bring attention to road races. People want to run to show their solidarity. This is all over the Western world, mind you - not just in the US. Thats why my partner and I got the idea to put on this race in Belfast. Hes from there, I love the city, and hell, what better a location to conduct a marathon than a place with the word fast in its name? The marketing writes itself.

The Belfast city council approved the marathon pretty quickly. It didnt conflict with any other road event and Belfast was doing some citywide healthy living campaign, so another road race only helped draw attention to it. 

As online registrations for the marathon trickled in, I tackled the sponsorship duties. My partner has enough money to conduct the event on his own if he wants, but obviously its better to have sponsors. Its not only money were after, but gear, food, tents, and all that stuff. It was slow going for a while, but it started to pick up after we got Applied Dynamics on board. Companies liked the idea of having their name on the same t-shirt as AppDyn.

AppDyn didnt contribute much money - only $1000 USD. But they promised to send a few thousand of their newly-developed fruit/vegetable/nut bars they were planning to release next year. Apparently theyre great for runners.

They gave me a sample when we met - it was pretty good. I had great energy afterward. My partner ate one, too, but he had an awful [allergic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4j23w5/far_too_many_mushrooms/?st=iy4jn5mi sh=d004e26f) reaction. He blamed himself for not reading the ingredient list. It was there in plain English: peanuts. Still, he was stuck home recuperating, which meant I had to do the bulk of pre-marathon preparation. I felt bad for the guy. The reaction was way worse than ones hed had in the past. The skin blisters were just...ugh.

Two days before the race, a few friends and I decided to run the course. The official goal was to make sure everything was just how wed planned and that the course markers were set up properly, but I just really wanted to run. Id been eating the AppDyn bars for breakfast, lunch, and dinner ever since their rep gave me a case of them. I felt amazing. 

We ran the course and it seemed to be set up perfectly. About halfway through, I broke free from the group and just ran on my own. [I was alone in my thoughts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4pcmbf/never_enough_bones/?st=iy4jl5r8 sh=ea44a84a) Before I knew it, I was crossing the finish line with a personal record time.

I wanted to be elated. I wanted to brag to my partner that Id beaten his personal best, too, but it didnt seem right. Id just learned hed been hospitalized again.

The initial allergic reaction to the peanuts had passed. His doctors were confused, because none of the residual allergens should have been in his system after all that time. Still, his conditions worsened. They tested him with all the different ingredients listed on the bar. All but one - something called [MR332d](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4kuldv/far_too_little_courage/?st=iy4jkbnp sh=c5fd2a0b).

When his doctors contacted AppDyn to find out what it was, they were told it was a proprietary blend of mushroom extracts. That seemed to put the doctors on edge. AppDyn wasnt forthcoming about the types or quantities they used in the bar. Still, no one else whod consumed the bars exhibited any problems whatsoever. As the hospital fought over the phone with AppDyn to get the names of the mushrooms, my partners condition worsened.

As difficult as it was for me to see him suffering, he wanted me to keep working on the marathon. It was important to him that the race went on as planned. Wed put too much time and energy into the event to let one of us getting sick derail the whole thing.

The morning of the marathon, everything was going well. The volunteers were out on the course setting up water tables, the medical tents were erected, and the vendors were getting their products out. I got a call from my partner. He sounded better than he had in days. He said he was coming to the race.

I was shocked. The day before, when Id visited, he had looked utterly horrible. Like, deaths door horrible. I asked if he was sure, and he told me the worst was over. Hed get there just in time for the start. We hung up and I kept preparing.

The area where the runners picked up their bibs with the numbers was right next to the AppDyn tent. They were giving out the bars left and right. The runners loved them. Some even came back for more to carry with them as they ran. AppDyn obliged and gave them all they wanted.

My partner arrived about 20 minutes before the start. I almost fell over. He looked much better. I was confused, though, because hed shown up in his running gear. I asked why, assuming he couldnt possibly be planning to run after everything hed been through. I just laughed and said hed run here from the hospital and felt great. I didnt try to hide my concern and strange feeling of dread. There was nothing I could do to stop him.

Seeing my discomfort, he laughed and told me not to worry. Then he gave me a hug. His skin felt strange.

A little while later, we had the countdown. I fired the pistol when the clock hit zero and over a thousand runners took off. I went over to the control tent and monitored the radio chatter from the pace vehicles. While I listened, one of the volunteers nudged me and said, hey, I think you cut yourself and pointed to my forearm. I looked down.

I wasnt cut. Stuck to my forearm was a patch of skin that was not my own. It was bloody and ragged. I poked it. It was tacky - just like my partners had been when he hugged me. With a sickening realization, I knew it had to be his. It had just...come off. 

I excused myself and went into one of the portable toilets to clean up. I picked at the skin, and gradually, pieces came off. It was extremely [sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/47k6x1/slough_part_1_of_2/?st=iy4jmg27 sh=c0409c4c). But there was something else, too. I brought my forearm up and studied it. Attached to the underside of the tacky flesh were little nubs. They were moving. No, growing. And they looked a lot like stringy, white [mushrooms](http://unsettlingstories.com).

	<TEXT> [Previous.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/comments/540udh/runners_usubject3642/)

I hate hiking. I hate the outdoors. I hate being sweaty, dirty, bored, and nowhere near a good WiFi signal. Yet there we were. Hiking. And I was sweaty, dirty, bored, and nowhere near a good Wifi signal. Life was unpleasant.

Dad said it would be good for us to get out of the city for a while. He didnt say why. It was obvious work was getting to him; stress always makes him want to run away from the situation until he can figure a way to manage it. I figured thats what we were doing out in the woods. Running away - one sweaty step at a time.

Every night, hed make me do my homework by the fire while he sat at his laptop with the satellite internet connection I wasnt allowed to use. I didnt really think much of it. I know he does important stuff that other people cant look at. Those arent his rules. Still, I wish I could have gotten online for a little while.

After wed been hiking for four days, Dad started to take unusual interest in the plants we were passing. Hed pull off scraps of leaves and vines and roots and put them in bags. Later, when wed set up camp in the evenings, hed pull out the little microscope hed brought and take notes on his laptop. I didnt ask questions. It was obviously work related.

On the fifth day, after Dad collected his samples and looked at them under the microscope, he seemed to get pretty excited. He didnt jump up and down or anything, but his mood went from his brooding, no-nonsense default to something kind of like a kid. It was weird. And a little annoying. I could tell he wanted to talk to me about some of the stuff he found, but had to keep his mouth shut. 

Then I got a surprise. He started talking. And not the normal Dad stuff, either. About his work. About his projects.

Id always known he was one of the top guys at a place called Applied Dynamics and that the company was huge. I never knew what he really *did*, however. If someone asked, Id just say biology stuff. Turns out I wasnt wrong.

Dad talked about samples that were turning up on the plants around us. Samples that, according to him, were getting denser and denser as we made our way through the woods. When I asked what he was talking about, he just told me to wait. He didnt say he wouldnt tell me at all, but only that I had to wait. Even though I didnt know what he was talking about, for the first time, I started to get a little excited.

On the morning of the sixth day, he told me we needed to pick up the pace. Hed been studying his laptop since before Id woken up and there seemed to be some urgency in his voice. I didnt argue. I helped him pack up the campsite and we headed off. He was moving at a good clip all day, and when I wanted to stop for lunch, he said to eat it while we walked. Even when I had to duck behind a tree for a few minutes, he just kept walking and yelled for me to catch up. I did.
When the sun began to set, we entered a clearing at the top of a hill. Dad stopped walking. He put down his backpack, pulled out the laptop, and sat in the grass. 

Are we here?, I asked.

Yeah, Dad replied. Were here.

I set up the tent while he typed and complained about how the solar charging thing for his laptop hadnt done a good job over the course of the day.

It grew darker and stars dotted the sky. Id never seen the stars so clearly. There were so many.

I heard rustling in the bushes to our left. I started but Dad put his hand on my arm and said not to worry. I stared at the bushes. A deer peeked its head out and looked around. I sighed with relief.

Why dont you look for constellations?, Dad asked.

With nothing better to do, I took his advice. I saw a few.

How much longer will--, I started to say, but was cut off.

Look up there, Dad instructed, and pointed. 

I followed his finger and saw a black dot forming over the stars. It grew larger as the seconds passed, blocking more and more of them. I couldnt tell what it was.

The bushes rustled again. I glanced over. It was the same deer. When I looked up again, I yelped. The stars were gone. No, not gone - blocked entirely. There was something hovering over the clearing. It was massive and unlike anything Id ever seen before. In the faint light coming from the crescent moon, I could see it was fleshy and pockmarked with tightly-grouped holes that made me feel intensely uncomfortable.

Dad said something that sounded like, go ahead, Aida. He pulled a flashlight out of his bag and illuminated the ground beneath the object.

The deer disappeared from the bushes and instantaneously reappeared at the center of the clearing. Three more deer joined it, along with countless squirrels, birds, woodchucks, and a bear. They didnt move. 

Dad, what--, I tried, but was cut off again.

At your own pace, Aida.

A dark, orange smoke began to pour out of the hovering object and descended on the group of animals. I instinctively drew a breath of clean air and held it. Dad shook his head.

Dont worry, youll be fine.

I exhaled and watched.

When the smoke touched the animals, their fur or feathers or skin began to move. Then split. Blood coated the grass. I felt severe revulsion but didnt turn away. From the fissures, long, stringy objects erupted. They looked like mushrooms.

Remember when I was looking in the microscope, Mo? There were spores on the plants. All the plants and animals around here have them. Its working.

I didnt know what he was talking about and I was paying him very little attention at that moment. The tips of the stringy mushrooms ballooned and dropped off, leaving baseball-sized pieces in the bloody grass. The animals continued to disintegrate as more and more of the fungus burst forth and dropped off.

I blinked and the hovering thing was gone. The animals were nothing but pulp now. A thick bouquet of mushrooms grew in their place. 

Watch, Dad whispered.

The round bits that had fallen off the mushrooms had started to wiggle. Then shudder. Tubes about as long as my fingers slid out. They slapped and writhed around in the gore, but then they went rigid. With a final wiggle, the pieces turned on top of the tubes. The tubes were legs.

The pieces skittered off in every direction with delicate streams of orange smoke leaking from holes in their bodies.

Well stay here for three more days, Dad informed me. And when we get back, everythings going to be a lot different. Youll see.

Flies buzzed over the [animal remains](http://unsettlingstories.com).

	<TEXT> Ive always felt anxiety and pressure in social situations. It wasnt that I disliked the people around me. Far from it. But something about the expectation to perform in a social capacity always filled me with dread.

For a while, I thought I was broken. Everyone I knew loved hanging out and being around one another. In one of my peaceful moments of alone time, I decided to do a little research to find out if something was wrong with me.

I learned about introversion. I learned about countless millions of people just like me. It became my mission to discover and understand the ins and outs of that mindset so I could better myself. I finally realized I didnt have to change who I was. I could embrace it.

Over the years, Ive cultivated knowledge I feel may be helpful to other introverts who dont know there are people like them. I want to share with you some examples of situations where I felt uncomfortable and how I handled them. I dont expect everyone to encounter the exact same situations or react the same way, but I think this will be a good template for other introverts to use.

**1. Do you feel enormous anxiety about having to go to parties? You may be an introvert!**

There was a party at my college. My boyfriend at the time, Jay, really wanted me to attend. This was at a really bad time in my life and the last thing I wanted to do was plaster a smile on my face and interact with drunken strangers. I tried and tried to convince Jay that I didnt feel well and that the party wouldnt be a good idea, but he kept trying to guilt trip me into going.

After a while, I told him Id go. The party was a couple days away.

I was really upset with both Jay and myself. I was mad at him for not respecting my claim that I was sick, but I also hated myself for being so messed up that I was forcing him to have to make me to go to a silly party. I didnt sleep for two nights because I was so nervous.

On the day of the party, while Jay was still sleeping, I secretly took a dose of syrup of ipecac. When Jay awoke, I was in the bathroom puking my guts up. Id never felt so sick in my life, but he finally believed me. Hours later, after hed made sure I was going to be okay, he went to the party by himself. Id won. My stomach still hurt, but the night alone was wonderful.

**2.  Have you ever been at work and been told you need to do something that fills you with dread because youll have to interact with other people? You may be an introvert!**

Years later, there was a mandatory retreat at my job. All employees had to go for team building or something similarly awful. Id just started feeling comfortable at work, too; Im a designer so I get to spend almost all day alone, drawing logos or characters or whatever for clients. Hearing I had to go on this retreat brought terrible, breathless anxiety. I didnt know what to do.

On my drive to the convention center, I saw a homeless man sitting near a payphone. I had an idea. We spoke for a few seconds, I handed him a quarter and a $20 bill, then I got back in my car. I drove up the street, parked, and watched the man in my mirror.

He picked up the phone and dialed. A minute or two later, he hung up and ran away. I pulled the car back into traffic and kept going toward the retreat. Ten minutes later, I got a phone call from my supervisor saying someone had called in a bomb threat at the convention center. We were to come to the office and treat it as a normal workday.

**3.  Does the thought of seeing people from your past make you feel awful because youll be in a situation where you need to talk about your life? You may be an introvert!**

My sister, Melinda, was having her baby shower. Shes only a couple years older than me, so we knew many of the same people in high school. Shes still friends with most of them. Im not. Most of them used to make fun of me while others only talked to me because I was Melindas sister. I didnt want to go. At all.

My car was in the shop, so Melinda offered to pick me up. There was no use trying to fake being sick. Mel knows Im an introvert and get anxious in social situations. But this was important to her. She wouldnt take no for an answer.

She picked me up a few hours before the party so we could go to our parents house where the event was being hosted. The plan was to help Mom set things up so she didnt have to do it all. I wanted to do the setting up and leave, but that was out of the question.

Mels phone rang while we were on our way. It was her friend, Denise. Apparently Denise and eight other guests had arrived early to help Mom with the decorating so Mel wouldnt have to. While Mel was elated, I was distraught. Id built in a mental countdown that gave me three hours before Id have to be around those people. I was planning on using those hours to try to get myself in a state of mind where I could accept being with them. But now it was gone. I had no time to prepare.

I started to silently panic as we hurtled down the highway toward my impending social cataclysm. I was sweating. Everything blurred. My heartbeat was like a series of constant detonations behind my ribcage. Ahead of us, on the side of the highway, I saw a family of deer. One of the fawns placed a foot on the pavement. I saw an opportunity.

I screamed, look out! and grabbed the steering wheel, turning it in the opposite direction. Our car struck the median, flipped over it, and sent us into oncoming traffic. Another car hit us at 75 miles per hour.

Somehow, when the whirlwind of chaos had ended and the car was no longer moving, I was relatively unhurt. My arm and leg were broken, that I could tell immediately, but everything else seemed okay. Mels side had taken the brunt of it.

Mel was pinned by her legs by the steering column. She was bleeding badly from her head, but she was breathing. Her hands were flailing at her belly. I looked down. A piece of metal from God-knows-where had carved a deep gash through her lower abdomen. I could see the a wet loop of intestine sticking out. And something else. A tiny, twitching foot.

The baby shower was cancelled.

So if any of these scenarios of socialization and togetherness make you feel anxious or lightheaded, you may be an introvert! I hope this helps, because nothing is worse than feeling like you have no control over your life. Sometimes its just good to be alone. And you know what? Theres nothing wrong with it. Theres no shame in [being different.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

	<TEXT> Yeah so for those who dont know me Im Madison. I told a [story about my stupid sister](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4ho869/um_can_any_of_you_guys_tell_me_whats_wrong_with/?st=ivbamqdh sh=d65e3411), then [my gross brother](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5c2xzz/ok_now_my_brother_is_all_messed_up_and_gross_lol/?st=ixqaar4v sh=33e9ea48), then my [poor hot gay friend Kevin](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5i4e1h/omg_guys_why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_a_boyfriend/?st=ixqab4ot sh=30c286c6). If you dont know those stories, I kinda hate you because theyre really important and like who the h*ck do you think you are coming in here and acting like youre going to read about my first time and not care about the other things that are happening in my life? You should go, like, assistant manage a small diner or something just as sad lol.

Omg anyway guess what? IM GONNA TELL YOU A STORY!! :D

This is gonna sound soooooo creepy and weird but youll read it anyway because Im awesome and its fun to read stuff about people who are better than you lol. Omg btw I love Katniss Evergreen. Random. But yeah dont worry its not like it was my uncle or anything gross like a dog or hippo or something. 

Ok so maybe like 18 months ago this really cute guy snuck into my room. You know how vampires have to get invited into your room before they can come in your room and visit you in your room? Yeah this wasnt like that because he wasnt a vampire. This guy just kinda came in through the window and sat on the side of my bed.

I was like what are you doing here and got all mad because I didnt have my hair right and I was wearing my ugly fleecy pants instead of my hot fleecy pants and he was okay looking but not like stupid Kevins hot dumb brainless head but I didnt know Kevin back then so he was better than okay I guess. 

I wanted to call Dad to come beat the guy up but there was something about him that was kinda cool. He was like gray like a rock or a cloud or gay poetry stuff and had cool red eyes and a really big mouth. He started rubbing my hair which was annoying but I couldnt move for some reason then he whispered in my ear:

Madison youre going to be a mom someday. Then his fingers got really long and skinny and he put them behind my eyes.

I was like um gross and no thank you but I didnt say it because I still couldnt move and then everything got all dark and I woke up kinda sore and stuff. And ew not there.

And thats the story! You guys are lucky Im good at setting a mood otherwise that wouldve seemed even weirder and creepier than it was.

But yeah, that was my first time with the gray man.

Wanna know why Im telling you all this? Obv you do lol.

Welllllllllllllllllll GUYS IM GONNA BE A MOM!!!

Ok ok ok you cant tell my parents but its not like they can see the little baby yet anyway because its growing behind my eyes but I can already feel its tiny little hands pushing on the eye cords or whatever theyre called. Good thing Im not ticklish lol.

Theres only one person I told and thats poor gay Kevin so I could make him feel jealous but he just kinda drooled and said uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh because hes annoying but so hot but I know he wished he was the one who put it in me and not the gray man. Its funny because Id forgotten all about the gray man until the little baby started growing over the weekend! Itd been years and I thought babies were made in nine months and in a uterus but mine is gonna be cool so thats why its different.

Another weird thing - Ive always always always hated babies! I was so happy when my little brother died and until he came back I had to hear him crying and stuff every time I bent his knee back when Mom or Dad wasnt looking. But now, Im so excited to be a mom. What could be better than another little Madison running around? Literally nothing, thats what.

Im going to be the coolest mom. Ill let my baby have parties and vape and talk to Black God and wear whatever she wants and never have to learn Spanish if she doesnt want.

Check this out - when Gina died it was exactly one year after the gray man came to visit. I never even connected that! I was so excited to have my bedroom all to myself I didnt even think of the dates being the same! Btw guys it is SO COOL to still have a room to myself and I wont even mind sharing with the baby.

But yeah at school I didnt want to tell people about the baby except Kevin but get this! Karen said something bad about my hair and said it wasnt really blonde but brown like Im an Italian or something and I got real mad and all of the sudden a little baby hand came out of my eye and cut Karens throat open lol. NOBODY saw it happen, either! Karen was laughing at me and then her neck was all shooting blood and stuff and she died and everyone was sad and I pretended to be sad but I wasnt sad even though I have to go to a little vigil and say Im sad.

Im so not sad. My baby is awesome and Im so glad the gray man put it in me. I just dont know when Im going to tell my parents. It seems like theyre [never home anymore](http://unsettlingstories.com).

	<TEXT> Im a geologist working at Death Valley National Park in Nevada. Over the last few months, weve been studying the geological formation dubbed Devils Hole. [Heres what it looks like](https://youtu.be/a6h82PIi_-0), for those interested.

Anyway, Ive always found this place somewhat disconcerting. We have a vague idea of how it came to be and what makes it do what it does, but theres something else. Something...off.

The other day, we sent a little submarine drone into the water to see if it could map out the labyrinthine cave system we know is there, but has been completely inaccessible for decades. Also, we wanted to find out how deep it goes. The fact an earthquake in China could cause the water to rise so substantially at this spot in Nevada makes us think it goes way deeper than preliminary estimates.

The sub started to map the first 50 feet. It was tough to get a great signal; the mineral content of the water was really inhospitable to the systems we use and how they communicate with one another - not to mention the superheated water near the geothermal vents once you get down there could be enough to disable the drone entirely.

At around 75 feet, the signal got really touchy. Wed have a few minutes of decent communication, but then it would cut out completely and leave us wondering if the sub had crashed or had been damaged beyond recovery. 

During the windows when we could move the drone, we explored from cave to cave and went deeper and deeper. The water was well above boiling; as the pressure increased, so did the temperature. The sub was rated for up to 400 degrees for a short period of time, and pockets of water were getting close to that maximum.

We got to a relatively cool spot (around 225 Fahrenheit) and were told to standby. Greg, the guy who was operating the optical equipment on the drone, kept insisting that he was seeing flashes of light way below our position. I kept insisting that the equipment was malfunctioning and causing the flashes, but Greg wouldnt shut up about another sensor registering bursts of heat at the same time the flashes showed up.

We argued for a little while and the drone stayed in place. The water level in the hole started to rise. This wasnt unexpected; a surprisingly little amount of seismic activity anywhere in the world was enough to move the water over here. We kept bickering and didnt notice more flashes on the screen until much later, when we analyzed the video. 

What finally knocked us out of our respective tantrums, though, was the way the water started to change color. It went from its normal shade to a dull red. Greg glanced at the screen and noticed the depth of the water in the cave chamber, originally at 36 feet, had changed to 353,000 feet. We knew had to be an error.

More flashes showed up on the screen as the water frothed and burbled on the surface, then the feed went dead. And stayed dead. 

Greg and I analyzed the video overnight. Everything wed seen was there and just as confusing - but then Greg saw a tiny spike in the audio track right when the depth of the cave appeared to drop straight down.

He ran it through a few filters to amplify the signal and clean it up, then he played it back. We listened to it about 20 times in a row, despite hearing it perfectly the first time.

Let me sleep. Let me dream. Soon I will rise.

Corresponding with the massive increase in depth and the last word of the message, there was one more flash in the final video frame before the drone was lost. After Greg cleaned it up, we saw what it was. A single, glowing, red eye that looked like the size of a house.

	<TITLE> Open Mouths </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-05 16:43:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Their pale faces were tilted skyward. Each pair of eyes brimmed with hope. In the moonlight, their skin seemed luminous; a battle of bright flesh against the surrounding darkness. Their mouths were slightly open, as if expecting to receive holy communion. They stood in a circle on the mossy ground, hand in hand. Their open throats drooled blood down their young chests.

Under my bare feet, the moss felt so comforting. So inviting. With the children standing guard, I would curl up on the ground and fall asleep.

That was 25 years ago. It was my nightly ritual. Id sleepwalk to the clearing in the woods outside our home and sleep next to the five children. No one noticed I came home at dawn. No one would have cared anyway.

After I turned 14, it all stopped. I assumed it had to have been a recurring dream. Yes, I sleepwalked nearly every night. Yes, I spent those nights in the woods. But no children were ever reported missing. There were no slit throats. Just trees and moss. Lots and lots of moss.

I moved away when I turned 19. As the years went by, the memories grew hazy, as theyre wont to do. Certain things trigger them, though. Some more strongly than others. Lately, its been open mouths.

The open mouths of the children were always a source of fascination for me. I wasnt put off by their slit throats. I wasnt disturbed by their warm, skyward stare. No, their mouths were the source of my inquisitiveness. I would walk around their circle, moss brushing between my toes, and look inside their mouths. They looked warm and soft; pink tongues and small teeth and narrow throats. 

When I was eight, I kissed one of the two girls. The redhead. Her lips were full and tasted like pine. I felt my breath collect in her mouth and spill back into mine. She didnt move. My body sang.

I tasted pine for years afterward. No kiss since has ever been so enthralling. The decades passed with a growing sense unfulfillment.

When my parents died last year, I moved back into their home. It was very much the same. Now I go about my day-to-day business, but the children are still very much in my mind. The softness of the moss against my skin and the sense of protection I had as I slept near them has been impossible to shake. My nostalgia has only grown since returning to the home near where it had all happened.

Some nights, I walk to the mossy clearing. Its as beautiful as it always had been, especially when the moon is full and I recall it shining against porcelain skin and bright eyes and wet mouths. Ill curl up on the moss and sob myself to sleep. Alone.

Ive found some solace in cultivating that same moss. Its the only tangible remnant of that comforting time in my life. Ive been able to coax patches of it to grow in my dirt-floor basement, and thats where I sleep now. There, in the moss, in the comfort of my home, I can dream again. The dreams are a temporary fix, but better than nothing. Theyll be enough until it can happen again. I know it will.

The first child I claimed is a girl with red hair. The bulb in the basement doesnt look like moonlight. Its yellow hue causes her skin to look sallow and sickly. Her eyes are clouded and difficult to keep open. The gaping throat is the same, though. The throat keeps the memory real. And before I curl up next to her pinned feet and sleep, I make sure to kiss her open mouth. I fantasize about pine as the taste of metal [coats my tongue](http://unsettlingstories.com).

	<TITLE> Caviar </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-04 16:09:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ive gone all over the world to find the best food. Six continents, thousands of regions, countless dishes; all in search of the perfect meal. For a while, I thought it may never happen. There was always something a little off; salt, freshness, temperature - tiny, niggling complaints that, to anyone else, would be meaningless. To me, though, they were the difference between perfection and mundanity. My quest went on.

During my travels, Id learned about an underground supper club in Moscow which met once a year. While underground supper club sounds mysterious and illicit, its just a place that operates casually, aka: without a food license. Chefs all over do it all the time for their friends. Ive been to many.

This one was supposed to be different. They had the best caviar.

Caviar is a luxury item, but even in luxury-obsessed Russia, its started to fall out of favor because of sustainability issues. Its still widely available, but the good stuff is getting harder and harder to find. The best stuff is nearly impossible to get a hold of. Its locked down by the oligarchs and heads of state; if youre not one of them or in close company, youre out of luck. So when I heard that supper club would be serving the best of the best, I knew I had to get in there.

It wasnt easy.

It took four years to ingratiate myself with influential Moscow foodies. I spent thousands upon thousands of dollars at their restaurants, building a reputation, blogging about their food, and cultivating relationships. Vasily Protchenko, a restaurateur and minor celebrity in Moscow, noticed me. Over time, we became friends. I didnt know if he was privy to the supper club, but if anyone was, he had to be one of them. I didnt say anything, though. I waited. 

One afternoon, Vasily and I were talking about caviar, specifically the best sources. He mentioned the waters off Japan, which I found strange, since the Fukushima disaster had scared people away from certain types of fish in that area. He agreed that it was moderately disconcerting, but insisted the caviar from the fish in those waters was sublime. Then it happened.

You know, he told me, theres something even better. Something practically nobody knows about. Can you keep a secret?

I did my best to contain my excitement. This had to be what Id been waiting for.

Of course, I told him, and leaned in to listen.

Vasily told me about the supper club. There were 20 chefs and a few of their close friends from all around the world. They met in a restaurant right down the street from Vasilys, and if I was willing to pitch in the $5,000 and keep my mouth shut, Id be allowed to attend. One hour and a trip to the bank later, I had the $5,000. All I had to do was wait.

On the evening of the supper, I met with Vasily at his restaurant and had a drink. Then we walked down to the meeting place, which had a sign in front saying it was closed for the weekend. We walked around back to the kitchen and opened the door. The kitchen was full of chefs. Some of the chefs I recognized from my travels, some were strangers. All were busy preparing dishes for the evening.

We sat in the main dining room and I admired the decor. The room was softly candlelit and the windows had been covered in black paper. It was obvious this was a private event and no prying eyes were allowed.

How does this work?, I asked Vasily.

They just start bringing out courses. Theyre small, obviously, so you can sample all of them. The caviar will be at the end, I think. Its the rarest and most special of all the dishes.

True to his word, the food began to arrive. We were treated to sumptuous courses prepared by the meticulous and downright-genius minds of the master chefs. I ate and drank until my head spun.

Vasily excused himself and went to the kitchen. I chatted with some of the other diners and learned many were like me - rich foodies looking to experience the best of the best. 

After a little while and a few more courses, someone near the kitchen clapped their hands to get everyones attention. To my surprise, it was Vasily.

I want to thank everyone for coming tonight, he announced. The evening, as always, has been an incredible success. Weve sampled food from the greatest chefs around the world, and as is customary, we like to end the night with something very special. You all know Im passionate about my caviar. Youve had the best from all over; Russia, Japan, Canada, etc etc. Tonight, I have another treat. Its something extremely rare and takes a very long time to produce in quantities fit for consumption.

A parade of servers carrying silver trays emerged from the kitchen. They swarmed around the room, placing plates of food in front of each diner. Vasily continued.

This is the culmination of a years work. I had to pull a lot of strings and grease a lot of palms to bring this to you tonight, but for the first time, Id like to share with you this caviar. It is without a doubt the rarest caviar on the planet, and I believe it is the most exquisite. Please, enjoy.

Everyone applauded and Vasily bowed and came back to me.

I had no idea you were the one behind the caviar!, I exclaimed.

Vasily grinned. I wanted you to be surprised, he admitted. Now please, eat. Let me know what you think.

I looked down at my plate. There was a toast point, perfectly browned, covered with a reddish-brown paste. Atop the paste was a dollop of crme frache flecked with green pieces of dill. My mouth watered.

I brought it to my mouth and bit. My eyelids closed and I chewed, savoring the taste. It was thick and briny with distinct, livery notes. It was unlike any caviar Id had in the past, but it was undoubtedly spectacular. I took another bite. The complexity of the flavor profile was mind boggling. Without realizing it, Id been grinning like an idiot the whole time.

Vasily asked, so what do you think?

I swallowed and said, its the most incredible thing Ive ever tasted. Its so smooth and buttery; theres none of the intense saltiness or pop of normal caviar and I initially missed it, but then the notes of liver came through and coated my tongue. Where is it from?

North Korea, Vasily said.

My God, I replied, how did you get access to those waters without being shot?

Well heres the thing, Vasily told me, I know a guy. Hes a doctor over there.

I picked up my last piece and ate it while Vasily talked.

I knew Id never be able to fish in NK waters. But the first time the doctor and I talked, I realized he had access to this caviar without even knowing it. Over the years, I paid him a lot of money to collect it for me.

I was puzzled.

So the doctor brought you the fish?, I asked.

Vasily laughed. No no no, the doctor isnt a fisherman! Hes a specialist - he has no time for fish.

A specialist in what?, I inquired, profoundly confused.

Gynecology, Vasily told me. Theyre really into forced sterilizations over there. Its bad for them but great for us. Without it, we wouldnt have any of this caviar!

The room seemed to darken and I felt my mouth getting very wet and very dry at the same time. I formed the words, Vasily, what kind of caviar is this?

The chef grinned. [Lady caviar!](http://unsettlingstories.com)
