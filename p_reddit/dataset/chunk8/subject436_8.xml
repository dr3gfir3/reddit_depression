We report a dramatic and novel consequence of adaptation of mammalian cells to culture in which global loss of 5hmC occurs, suggesting rapid concomitant loss of methylcytosine dioxygenase activity. The observed epigenetic and transcriptional re-programming occurs much earlier than previously assumed, and has significant implications for the use of cell lines as faithful mimics of in vivo epigenetic and physiological processes. </TEXT>

These animals have been spending great lengths of time off Dominicas west coast. This means that I have been able to do quite a bit of interaction with these whales from the time I started swimming with them."

Andrew Armour, a diving guide known for years as the Whale Whisperer, showed why his nickname is appropriate when while guiding a diving tour off Dominca Island in the Caribbean he prompted a sperm whale to mimic his actions.

Underwater photographer Scott Belt filmed the amazing interaction which he called a once-in-a-lifetime experience and unbelievable.

	<TEXT> Joking aside, it's pretty obvious that only those who hit the button become "participants". Also, the "button engaged" issue is not covered at all by the "pressers vs. non-pressers" idea, or by the flair in general.

This is way more complex than "pressers vs. non-pressers".

	<TEXT> Noticed there are two phenomenons happening?  The timer resets, and then at times the button gets engaged (a.k.a. fully pressed, a.k.a. a shock-wave appears), and **there is no apparent relationship between these two**. 

Every time someone hits the button, the timer resets, but the button does not get fully engaged every time is getting hit. Just watch the timer resets vs. the shock-wave occurrence.

Also, only those who hit the button became "participants", it seems. Once the timer gets to 0, they will be able to participate in something, don't know what. 

Once the timer reaches 0 and the button is fully engaged, some sort of a game will start. Maybe it's the reddit version of The Hunger Games. </TEXT>
