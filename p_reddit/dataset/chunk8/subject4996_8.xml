	<TEXT> Can anybody with more experience with cycling tell me how much this bike is worth? Im debating purchasing this bike and am unsure about its value. Apparently its a "rare" niche bike for shorter riders. I don't want to give away the asking price yet to prevent some sort of priming effect just in case lol. Thanks! http://imgur.com/a/0KMJa </TEXT>
