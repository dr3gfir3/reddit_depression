	<TEXT> Have you not heard of that pupper who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the kennels, and borked incessantly: "I seek the Master! I seek the Master!" -- As many of those who did not believe in the Master were lying around just then, he provoked v many laffs. "ha ha has he got lost, fren"? asked one. "Did he lose his way like a baby pupperino"? asked another. "Or is he doing a hide ? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated?" -- Thus they borked and laffed.

The pupper jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. "Whither is the Master?" he cried; "I will tell you. We have killed him -- you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Are we not being done a frighten? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying the Master? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Master, too, decompose.

The Master is dead.

The Master remains dead.

And we have killed him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a myth that medieval Christians considered the centrality of earth to be indicative of its importance, and resisted heliocentrism on these grounds. See Dennis Danielson's excellent article on this topic:

	<TEXT> We conclude that the most likely explanation was changes in cultivated varieties used today compared to 50 years ago, [lead author Donald] Davis said. During those 50 years, there have been intensive efforts to breed new varieties that have greater yield, or resistance to pests, or adaptability to different climates. But the dominant effort is for higher yields. Emerging evidence suggests that when you select for yield, crops grow bigger and faster, but they dont necessarily have the ability to make or uptake nutrients at the same, faster rate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's an exclusively Protestant doctrine.

With regards to substitution, surely there are plenty of pre-Reformation thinkers who believed that Jesus, in the place of us, took the covenantal curse of death upon Himself as part of his mission. 

E.g. St Hilary of Poitier, in his Homily on Psalm 53:

*"It was from this curse that our Lord Jesus Christ redeemed us, when, as the Apostle says: Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made curse for us, for it is written: cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree* [Gal. 3:13]. *Thus He offered Himself to the death of the accursed that He might break the curse of the Law, offering Himself voluntarily a victim to God the Father, in order that by means of a voluntary victim the curse which attended the discontinuance of the regular victim might be removed."*

St John Chrysostom, in his Homilies on Second Corinthians: 

*"If one that was himself a king, beholding a robber and malefactor under punishment, gave his well-beloved son, his only-begotten and true, to be slain;and transferred the death and the guilt as well, from him to his son (who was himself of no such character), that he might both save the condemned man and clear him from his evil reputation; and then if, having subsequently promoted him to great dignity, he had yet, after thus saving him and advancing him to that glory unspeakable, been outraged by the person that had received such treatment: would not that man, if he had any sense, have chosen ten thousand deaths rather than appear guilty of so great ingratitude? This then let us also now consider with ourselves, and groan bitterly for the provocations we have offered our Benefactor; nor let us therefore presume, because though outraged he bears it with long-suffering; but rather for this very reason be full of remorse."*

Or St Augustine of Hippo, in his work "Against Faustus":

*"If we read, Cursed of God is every one that hangeth on a tree,* [Gal. 3:13; cf.Deut 21:23] *the addition of the words of God creates no difficulty. For had not God hated sin and our death, He would not have sent His Son to bear and to abolish it. And there is nothing strange in Gods cursing what He hates. For His readiness to give us the immortality which will be had at the coming of Christ, is in proportion to the compassion with which He hated our death when it hung on the cross at the death of Christ. And if Moses curses every one that hangeth on a tree, it is certainly not because he did not foresee that righteous men would be crucified, but rather because He foresaw that heretics would deny the death of the Lord to be real, and would try to disprove the application of this curse to Christ, in order that they might disprove the reality of His death. For if Christs death was not real, nothing cursed hung on the cross when He was crucified, for the crucifixion cannot have been real. Moses cries from the distant past to these heretics: Your evasion in denying the reality of the death of Christ is useless. Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree; not this one or that, but absolutely every one. What! the Son of God? Yes, assuredly. This is the very thing you object to, and that you are so anxious to evade. You will not allow that He was cursed for us, because you will not allow that He died for us. Exemption from Adams curse implies exemption from his death. But as Christ endured death as man, and for man; so also, Son of God as He was, ever living in His own righteousness, but dying for our offences, He submitted as man, and for man, to bear the curse which accompanies death."*

From my admittedly limited reading of this topic, I've heard people emphasise that the Fathers are talking about a substitution in terms of death, rather than the imputation of sins, and that the latter *is* a later development. What are your thoughts, mr literarum?

That Christ genuinely suffered was one of the **earliest** issues that the post-Apostolic Fathers dealt with.

I seek the Master!" -- As many of those who did not believe in the Master were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter. "ha ha has he got lost, fren"? asked one. "Did he lose his way like a baby pupperino"? asked another. "Or is he doing a hide ? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated?" -- Thus they yelled and laughed.

The pup jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. "Whither is the Master?" he cried; "I will tell you. We have killed him -- you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Are we not being done a frighten? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying the Master? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Master, too, decompose. 

The Master is dead. 

The Master remains dead.

 And we have killed him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That somehow it okay to repress a minority because "I just don't like them." 

Of course, if it *were* true that this a case of "repressing a minority" out of personal animus then there would be no debate.

Imagine, for a moment, that you are a proponent of lowering some particular tax, because you think that it unfairly targets people who are financially struggling, and your opponent said "There might be an argument if you were doing anything other than taking this position out of your own self-interest, but as it is there is no debate, frankly. Sorry, thanks for playing." 

Surely your response would be something like "That's [fallacious rhetoric](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/petitio+principii) which mindlessly dismisses debate, rather than seeks to actually establish a case".

We know how the story goes.

If "the story" is something like *"what is widely considered by "progressive" thinkers in Western culture to be necessary social reform is always right"* then I don't think you've got some infallible beacon here: consider, as just one example, the case of eugenics, which had massive support among early 20th century intelligentsia, who pilloried the opposition (largely made up of those evil reactionary Christians) as being hopelessly behind the times, standing in the way of civilisation's progress and so on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I'm much more conservative in my views, I think I agree, and I think it needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

I mean, the fact that Abraham is described in Genesis 14 as travelling to Dan to rescue Lot is a classic example. Strictly speaking, Abraham couldn't have gone to  "Dan" because "Dan" (being named after the tribe of Dan settling there after the Exodus) didn't exist at the time under that name. In this case, I don't think it's a question of "error" or "bias": the author has clearly just renamed it to its "modern" name for the benefit of readers, and surely only a very wooden form of inerrancy would feel challenged by that.
