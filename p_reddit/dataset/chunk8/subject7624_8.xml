	<TEXT> Cleaning. I'm a stickler for a clean house and take time to dust obscure places, clean potential mold and grime from my sinks and bathrooms, and have spotless walls and floors. But I won't do it for anyone else, nor do it as a profession. Not that I don't have respect for housemaids and janitors, but you know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Erm, that's exactly the point of using the phrase. When you use it, you're *not* sorry for your actions. You're sorry that the other person was disappointed by the result of your actions, but you don't think you did anything wrong. It's precisely the phrase to use when you don't think you're guilty of wrongdoing. </TEXT>
