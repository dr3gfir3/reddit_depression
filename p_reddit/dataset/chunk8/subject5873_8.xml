	<TITLE> I Hate Saturday </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A shrill beeping startled me into consciousness and I blinked against the harsh overhead lights. A horrible chemical taste filled my mouth and as I brought my hands up to rub at my puffy eyes they quickly halted and pain shot up my arms. Cold metal dug mercilessly into my wrists, catching my full attention and snapping me immediately out of the post-sleep stupor. It must be Saturday again.

My wife shuffled over to the oven and pressed a few buttons, ending the beeping and letting out a wave of heat as she reached inside and pulled out a dish. My stomach gurgled and turned at the smell and the thought of what was about to happen once again. How did I let her get me again? I needed to stop letting my guard down.

"Time for dinner, hunnie!" Her chipper voice and gently swaying hips made it all the worse. How could she?!

A full plate was placed in front of me, assaulting my eyes and nose with the horrible stench and repulsive sight of what was about to be forced into my body. "Please don't" I pleaded, "I wasn't raised like you.... I can't eat that shit!"

I fought hard against the handcuffs but my arms were crossed and cuffed individually to the chair. My feet were constrained in a similar manner but to the table legs which were strong and sturdy. I had managed to break free the first night but there was no escaping this. My legs were stretched out in front of me so that I could not get purchase to stand and my arms tight behind me. I tried rolling to the side but only lost skin on my ankles and quickly came back to the center of my prison. 

A loving smile never left her face as she sliced through the viscera before me and soon had a perfect fork-full, moving steadily toward me. I clenched my jaw and pressed my tongue as hard as I could against the backs of my teeth in an attempt to keep it out. I could feel it rubbing against my thin-set lips.

"Open up or we will do this the hard way."

I took one look at the fork, then stole a glance her way. I knew she wasn't bluffing but I couldn't willingly open my mouth. She sighed and set the fork down, reaching for the harness she made that fit into my nose and around my neck. I threw my head back and forth and tried to snap at her hands but eventually, she had it around my head and the plugs pushed up into my nostrils.

A small amount of oxygen made it past the plastic and cloth but not enough. Soon my lungs were burning and I chanced a small breath through pressed teeth. Her hand was swift, slapping at my Adam's apple and I gagged, gasping for air. The fork found its way inside before I could blink and my stomach turned once again. 

Just being on my tongue sent tears streaming down my cheeks and my gag reflex increased to a code red. The little piece slid around on my tongue no matter how still I tried to be. The texture of it alone was enough to loosen the snot in my nose and it began to run down and around the plugs. Soon my beard was full of snot and salty tears.

"You have nine more pieces to go so you better hurry up. You know it is better when it is warm."

I stared at her with hatred, wishing innumerable evil upon her and bit down into the horrible filth she forced into my palette. Revulsion coursed through me and I shivered, goosebumps covering my entire body. My butthole puckered and fresh tears followed the salty paths to my chin. I could feel the juices sliding down my throat and the stringy meat coated my teeth. Two quick bites to mash it up as best as I could before tilting my head back and forcing it down. It spread its tendrils of pulp out as it slid down into my stomach. I highly doubted it would stay there long. Another piece made its way toward me on the fork and I let out a sob. 

"Please, I just can't. Don't make me do this. If you loved me-"

I was cut off when the fork jammed into my mouth and into my tongue. I pulled back instinctively from the pain and bit down accidently into the piece. The juices exploded in all directions and I choked once, twice, and the first piece came back up along with whatever she had drugged me with.

She tsked, cleaned it up, and pressed another piece toward me once more. 

I really fucking hate squash.

	<TEXT> Hunnie, we need to talk.

When I didnt get a response I kept going. Look, I dont know how to start, what to say. I messed up. Hunnie, I am so sorry.

Tears were streaming down my face before I knew it and I couldnt control them. My face was contorted with fear, shame, guilt.

I am not going to make excuses or blame one thing or another. After managing to control my emotions somewhat I continued. I am having an affair.

I paused there, waiting for some kind of response. Some backlash. Emotion. Anything. When I received none of it I hung my head, dried my tears, and walked out the door with a bag full of clothes. 

I stopped, turning one last time at the screen door and hoped she would be looking my way. When she wasnt I whispered Im sorry and headed for my car.

Sobs overcame me again after just a few blocks and I pulled the car over until they passed. Around the same time I regained my composure my phone rang and I answered it, hoping for my wife of eighteen years.

How did it go, a voice as sweet as honey asked me through the speaker?

It didnt. Not really. I confessed, planned on telling her everything. She never even looked at me or uttered a word. It was like she already knew and it didnt bother her. A fresh sob exploded out of my chest but was quelled quickly by the soft and gentle words sliding into my ear.

Shhh now, it is OK. I told you she would be fine about it. Now we can be together with a clear conscious. Why dont you come over and Ill draw you a bath, hmm?

A hot bath did sound nice, especially after a long day at the construction site and now this. Guilt crept up slowly as I put mile after mile between the house and my car. Halfway to my girlfriends house and I couldnt take it any longer. I crossed four lanes of traffic and popped over the median in a frantic U-turn. Horns blared and tires screeched all around me but I slammed my foot on the gas pedal and left the chaotic scene behind me. I needed her to acknowledge this!

The engine roared as I swerved and weaved through manicured streets filled with kids and their parents playing games and riding bikes. The tires ripped huge chunks of thick green grass out of the lawn and I flung the door open leaving the engine running. Four long steps got me to the front door and I burst inside. Why I was so angry I still dont know, but angry I was. 

Helen! Helen, I need to know you heard me. Helen?!

I sprinted through the home slamming open every door but she was nowhere to be found. Where could she have gone? I checked the garage but her car was still there. None of her clothes were missing. The door was still unlocked just as I had left it when I exited earlier. I grabbed for the cordless phone on the wall and started to punch in numbers.

Hi, Gary? Yea its me, have you heard from Helen? No, what? No, I just saw her today. Slow down! Why would you say that about your daughter?

I hung up, not able to listen anymore to the horrible things he had to say. 

The police found me about an hour later curled up in a ball on my bed holding our wedding picture. Gary had called, worried about my health and safety. I didnt fight when they took me down to the police station for questioning and evaluation. I passed the eval, of course. I wasnt crazy, I had just forgotten. Maybe that is the wrong word. I had not wanted to believe it and therefore didnt. 

They showed me some pictures and took me out back to the impound where they still had the car. It was smashed so badly only one of the four doors was visible, my door. How I managed to survive I will never know but she did not. The police still dont know why the car failed the way it did which is I guess why they still have it in the first place. The guilt washed away then, replaced by a fresh wave of sadness just as the tide moves in and out. 

I still get sad from time to time but Elana helps. She is such a great woman. I figured she would leave after I explained everything to her, my wife being dead and me being crazy and acting like she was alive all these long months. But she just smiled her soft smile and reassured me that we were meant to be together. It is hard to argue with a beautiful woman while soaking in a hot bath. 

Helen never appreciated you, you know.

I turned my head to respond and that is when I noticed a picture frame on the counter. It was a small silver frame with a picture of Elana and I on a hike through Big Sur. But she never went hiking with me in Big Sur, Helen did.

	<TEXT> Hi there, just a few things. 

1. I found the story to be a bit too choppy. I like going back and forth from past to present but maybe it was done at the wrong times or needs some polishing. 

2. I was never really scared or alarmed or worried. You need to have some real scare factor of some kind. 

3. It was a bit predictable in its ending. 

4. There are some typos and a misuse of a few words. I think you meant to use a different word but typed out another. 

I enjoyed reading it. It just needs some tweaking and a lot more scare.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-04-08 00:38:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I dont recall the first time I felt that warm, flowing sensation between my legs. I must have been young because I always seem to remember knowing about it. I just cant pinpoint the first time. I do, however, remember my first orgasm. 



We had just moved into a new home and I had my own bathroom for the first time in my short life. The first thing I did when I was all unpacked was take a nice, hot shower in my own personal bathroom. Steam filled the room quickly and soon I was covered in soapy bubbles. The best part was how the shower head could be taken off of the wall and move around. No longer would I need to bend over or hike up a leg to get all the soap off. I could just aim the water exactly where I needed it! Soon enough I found out *exactly* where I needed it. My parents water bill probably increased quite a bit that month.



Id call that my Awakening. From there I began to experiment. A Sharpie was my first toy. I have never told anyone about this or even asked questions relating to it out of embarrassment so I dont know if I progressed faster than most girls or if I was just another normal teenage girl. One Sharpie led to two. Sharpies led to hair brush handles. Brush handles let to carrots and cucumbers.



Each stage in my adventures thrilled me more than the next. The thrill just didnt last very long. I had to find something new, something bigger or better. Something to bring me back to that first night in my shower. 



-----------------------------



Friends gossip and some of my friends were talking about what they did with their boyfriends. It sounded like a lot of fun and maybe, just maybe, it would fill the void I kept searching for. I am not the most beautiful girl or anything but Ive noticed a few passing glances here and there. One of those glances came from a tall, muscular boy in my gym class. He was *gorgeous* and pretty popular as well, which made his glances all the better. Id get wet just thinking about it!



Within a week he was mine and I was his. I didnt know how to go about these things with a boy but he seemed to know a lot. It is different with a boy. Better. Maybe it is because I dont know what he is thinking so I am kept guessing. When it is just me I already know what I am going to do. The only bad side of it is how short he lasts. Doesnt he know I want it all the time? If I could have him inside me every minute of the day I would!



Our first time together was amazing for about a minute. I begged and pleaded for more and after a while he obliged. I guess boys and girls are very different because he started getting really tired while I was just getting started. I was wide awake when he passed out next to me. It was still nice and hard, glistening with what we had engaged in, beckoning me over. I played with it a little and before I knew it I had cut it off and pushed it back inside. It felt sooooo good and warm  but only for a few seconds. Boys are so stupid. He was screaming and bleeding all over but that didnt last too long. It took much longer to clean up than it did to have sex. 



So after that I gave up on boys. They were too much work for such little reward, you know? I began to experiment again and soon found out that I enjoy a little pain. If I added some pain even one Sharpie felt good again! I was so excited! I found this website that sold all kinds of fun things and used my babysitting money to buy it all. Clamps and tassels and oils and things that move and shake and wiggle. My eyes were bigger than my you know, because one of the things I ordered was almost the size of my arm!



Of course all of these fun things only lasted a little while. Once I try something I cant go back, you know? Always forward. I really want to try the huge one but I think it is more like a joke or something because there is no way it would fit, right? Maybe I will try once just to make sure.



Well the joke was on them because after just a few snips I was able to get it to fit and it feels so good! I just had to make like two or three little cuts so that I could open up a little more, you know? And all the blood makes it so easy to move back and forth. When I say it is big, I mean HUGE. I have to stand up and kind of squat onto it. 



------



Ugh so I just got back from school and all the girls are such bitches. Seriously, I just hate them all. I was in senior gym and I think one of my cuts re-opened so I was bleeding all over and all the girls started to make fun of me like it was my first period or something. They kept calling me Carrie, whatever that means. And then they said I was so gross I scared all the boys away (because my boyfriend hasnt been to school all week) so they think he ran away and switched schools just to get away from me. Stupid bitches. I threw a basketball at one of them and hit her right in her dumb head. 



Guess what?! She started bawling and had a broken lip, what a baby, but I got really excited by it, like if I was rubbing you know? Maybe I just like pain in general. Oh, I had an idea!



-------------



Thanks for coming over, Susan! I am just so sorry about throwing that ball at you. I was all worked up, you know?



She hesitated a bit before crossing the threshold of the home. Yeah, whatever, you know? Its cool. So why did you want to see me in person, again?



To apologize, silly. I just felt so so so bad and I know you LOVE cheesecake so I baked you one. I led her to the basement stairs. My parents remodeled the upstairs kitchen and put all the old stuff down here so I could learn without messing up their nice stuff. Whatever. Parents, right?!



She hesitated once again but the smells of freshly baked cheesecake wafted up into her nostrils and beckoned her down. One step at first, then she was down within a heartbeat.



That was so nice of you, you didnt have to do all of that. Cheesecake is a lot of work to make from scratch.



Oh it was no big deal. I LOVE cooking. Plus now we can sit and girltalk while we eat chocolate cheesecake. I pulled a chair out for her at the two-person bar table where the cake was waiting. 



I sliced the cake into eight pieces and served us each one. She dug in greedily and I nibbled while watching her. The way the chocolate coated her swollen, red lip was so sexy. I scooted out from my chair and walked around behind her, massaging her shoulders. Instantly she snapped her head up with wide eyes.



What the fuck?



Sorry, you just looked so happy eating it. I wanted to make it even better.



She jerked away from my hands and started for the stairs. Fucking weirdo. I knew I shouldnt have come over-



I tackled her from behind, driving her to the floor. She hit her head hard on the bottom step and a deep gash opened up right above her left eyebrow. I dragged her limp ass back to the unfinished part of the basement and tied her up to the stubbed water pipe that will probably never get any closer to being finished. I could feel the excitement coursing through me. Throbbing, pulsing. I was so WET! I stripped off my clothes and sat facing her bleeding face while I toyed into a climax. 



Yes, I like pain. I dont think Ill be bored for a while.

	<TEXT> So if I am getting the gist of this, you think people are including trans characters to increase the shock and horror of a story? 

Did you ever stop to think that maybe the op is trans? That they want to empower the group as a hero in the story or simply spread awareness of the terrible treatment certain people receive?

	<TEXT> I only downvote when it is clear the person just wrote a random idea on their phone without a single edit or moment of pause.

That is few and far between but it does happen. 

If I had to guess I would say I upvote 95% of the stories I read, 4.5% no vote, and 0.5% downvote. 

Maybe less deserve upvotes but I feel like many of my stories get votes they don't deserve simply from supportive community members, like a pat on the back to the new guy. Because of that I try to do the same.  </TEXT>

My eyes snapped open and my adrenaline immediately tripled. I fumbled with the sheets as I tried to untangle my sweaty legs from the cotton prison and bounded down the hallway to the security panel. I punched in the four digit code and a womans friendly voice greeted me several seconds later.

This is Watchful Skies operator 212, we received a motion detection alarm. Is everything okay in your home?

It was only a few steps from bedroom to hall but I was out of breath. I am not sure yet. Will you please stay on the line while I check the home?

Certainly sir.

Our home is on the smaller side but like all ranch-style homes it has a lot of windows. I reached for the bat I keep behind the closet door and slowly walked through each moon-lit room. I checked each window and door carefully for signs of forced exit or damage and each closet and hiding place. With each room my heart rate increased slightly, knowing that would be the room I found someone.

When I made a full circle of the home I let out a long breath and tried to regain my composure. I put the bat back in its place and informed the woman all was clear. She asked for the verbal clear code and I gave it to her and re-armed the system. I wiped the few beads of sweat off of my brow before heading into the bedroom.

My wife sat huddled in bed with eyes as big as Ive ever seen. Its okay, sweetheart. Just a false alarm. 

But, but why would it alarm at all? Are you sure you checked everywhere? Nothing is missing?

I crawled into bed and put my arms around her tightly and scratched her back. Yes everything is fine. Electronics are silly like that sometimes, you know? At least we know it works! I flashed my best grin and kept scratching until she drifted back into sleep.

-------------------

We both woke up a bit groggy from the midnight interruption but a large mug of coffee quickly remedied the slowness of step and glazed expressions. I tore the rubber band off of the paper and handed her all but the sports section. After a few poorly written stories about our awful teams and two pieces of peanut butter toast I got up and got ready for work.

Any news in the paper this morning, dear?

Nope, she replied with a grin.

See, nothing to be worried about. Lets get to work shall we?

I offered her my arm and walked down to the basement. We slipped on our lap coats and rubber galoshes and I keyed in the code. The large metal door swung in silently and I stepped through first. Just as I suspected one of our children had tried to escape again. I walked over to the cage our first born was in and inspected the damage. A few bent bars here and there but nothing I couldnt fix.

See? I asked my wife, I told you this was a good idea. *Why do we need to electrify the cages* you asked. *Why do we need a security system? What if they get suspicious?* She is a little hellion and needs to be taught a lesson. I directed my voice to our daughter and smacked her hard across the face. You try escaping again and a little zap will be the least of your worries.
