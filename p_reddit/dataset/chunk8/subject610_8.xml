You knew what that meant. Did you think I wouldn't clarify it? People like you are so strange, I'll never understand. Who does it work on? 

I was comparing her with the type of people I am suspecting criticizing her. It is speculation. But you knew that didn't you? 

OP was-sorry  

What?

is an attention whore  

Nothing in the photo brought attention to her identity, anything sexual, no cleavage, no crotch shot with a pet, nothing. It shows her fucking back and she is flashing the wilderness. There is ZERO connection to her identity. You are empty handed motherfucker, and threatened by her too.  

is an attention whore  

Not upset, just calling you ignorant children out.

	<TEXT>  People are criticising and downvoting it for it being so pretentious and attention seeking.

It isn't, and I explained as much. You are identifying nothing about the picture that fits this description. 

It's also interesting how you define how valuable a person is by whether they've lost their virginity. I think that says more about yourself than the people you're insulting blindly with no evidence.  

Here we go, victimization. That may or may not be an assault on their character, as is their assault on her character for the false accusation with nothing in the picture to support it. I was insulting them. Got that? For reason. If they are virgins and just young, they don't know fuck about life and it was more of identifying that. If they are old, they have no business judging someone having fun when they are so inept they cannot fulfill the most basic human desire. Fuck them. 

Do whatever you want but don't post it on a public site and not expect people to give their honest opinion.  

I didn't expect them not to. I am telling them they are baseless and come from an empty and weak place.  If they want to make baseless insults in public, then guess what chief, they have to take the blow back too.  

Also the fact she got this photo taken which appears to have taken at least a few minutes of planning. Instead of enjoying it she got a picture to show off.

You have no way of knowing that and common sense does not even suggest it. You've got nothing! How about she was with her friend an did something spontaneous and the friend took her phone out and took a pic because it was fun and funny. Showing off what? As I said before, she offered nothing for self gratification. 

You think you have an argument here? Are you taking the high ground? Nope. You are as empty and vile as the rest of them only you calculated a bullshit denial to avoid the deserved condemnation. Like I said, you've got nothing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't let this progressive babble fool you even if you hate Trump. They are using the unlikability of Trump to push a false narrative that enables women to continue to be persecuted globally under the guise of feminism. 

The majority of women who wear this horrific symbols of female oppression are done under horrific force. [Acid attacks and assassination](http://freethinker.co.uk/2016/10/03/the-disappeared-the-veil-and-the-erasure-of-the-female-body/), torture devices called the biter that rips skin off for violation of dress codes like [here](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/isis-terror-thugs-cut-womens-7445632).  

Maybe you need proof it can be [justified in their religious doctrine?](http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/veils.aspx). Wait, maybe you can dismiss what I say because I am not the appropriate race, religion, or gender, even though you don't know what that is. [Take it from a Muslim woman.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/12/21/as-muslim-women-we-actually-ask-you-not-to-wear-the-hijab-in-the-name-of-interfaith-solidarity/?tid=ss_fb utm_term=.5acb36373ad5).  

If you live in a country where you can wear it by choice, do it. When you begin to claim that it is a symbol of feminism when so many women are tortured and suffer under this nameless cloak, then you are a monster. All you have is your false narrative. All you have is "islamophobe" in lieu of an argument. You can criticize oppressive, barbaric, and violent tenets of a religion and advocate for it's reformation. That is in support of the modern Muslims living in society fighting against things like this such as Maryam Namazie and Ayan Hersi Ali.  

Is it too much to ask for people to acknowledge these women's suffering. Are you going to call me a racist, bigot, or islamophobe for asking you to? This needs to stop. Your obfuscation can only work for so long because the suffering of the women globally is not hidden and you will be exposed for the deranged monsters you are enabling the horrific treatment of women under the name of feminism.  </TEXT>

You are so enamored with the act of virtue signaling that you wont take the 2 minutes to look something so important up. You don't care about women, you care about your narrative and you are scum. 

You can start with these multiple examples of many religions with[this](http://britishasiansuk.com/girl-in-viral-twerking-video-says-she-is-sorry-during-interview-with-youtuber-ali-dawah/), [this](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/8-year-old-israeli-girl-face-clash-moderates-ultra-orthodox-jews-article-1.997389), [this](https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/25/indonesian-womens-rights-under-siege), or maybe you are into [stoning women to death in Iran](https://iranhr.net/en/articles/2790/). [Maybe you need acid attack or assassination for not being veiled?](http://freethinker.co.uk/2016/10/03/the-disappeared-the-veil-and-the-erasure-of-the-female-body/), [or maybe a torture device that clips womens hands for not wearing gloves?](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3463337/My-sister-punished-biter-not-wearing-gloves-pain-worse-labour-Teacher-fled-ISIS-describes-torture-device-clips-women-s-flesh-bodies-aren-t-concealed.html) 

The fact that you have the nerve to demand links on such a widespread problem and don't have the common decency to spend two minutes of your life to look anything up is absolutely disgusting.

This? What part of what I said. Nothing I said was untrue. This should be fun. 

FoxNews, Breitbart, Rush, etc. consistently obsess over the religion of Islamic attackers  

They are disgusting news organizations but I will not dismiss something that is true. You know who also says it is the religion. The fucking terrorists. 

[How about what they said after Brussels and Paris?](http://imgur.com/ZF7P9H3)  

[How about what they said after Nice?](http://imgur.com/HPGak5r)  

But wait, maybe what you need is an itemized list of what they said with grievances listed in order of dislike having doubled down on the fact that it is religion multiple times? Nah, that cannot exist. 

(NSFL) [Oh look it exists](http://clarionproject.org/factsheets-files/islamic-state-magazine-dabiq-fifteen-breaking-the-cross.pdf) 

KNow why I had to put NSFL? There are graphic pictures of beheading. It is explicitly told in great detail to PEOPLE LIKE YOU why they are doing it. 

People like you waste their time obfuscating everything and calling everyone bigots when the fast majority of sane people who oppose this nonsense support the reformation of Islam. You are sickening. Muslims suffer the most from people like this, and people like you enable them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  nope.. by 3 the kid should be able to reason and tell its caregiver what is wrong.

By what standard? You are just blindingly ignorant to toddlers and are trying to assert some arbitrary rule on the developmental psychology of a child that does not exist. Every parent it not given a blank slate. 

Fuck My niece was like 12 months and they taught her basic sign language,... she shit her pants she signed it didn't sit there and cry,, she was hungry,, she signed it... and it isn't uncommon now adays to do this, I know a ton of people that do it.  

What kind of grammatical clusterfuck was that? So yeah, cool story, but that means nothing and does not refute my point.  

also there were people boarding behind them, step to the side in the terminal and get your kid calmed down then board .. be considerate of other people

 You are not the respectable one here. Step aside where? It's obvious you have never had a kid, other than being an expert because of your niece, but now I wonder if you have ever been on a plane. 

I hope someone like you is on board when someone like me is on board and you try to embarrass a person like that. You will lose.  </TEXT>

parents downvote brigade  

No, these are adults. You don't need to have kids to understand that children don't have mental capacity or life experience to react to situations proportionately to their severity. Kind of like you. Irony again?   

Keep your shitty kid at home if they can't behave you don't have the right to ruin everyone's day.  

First of all, on their behalf, may I so no. I don't even have kids and it makes me happy that theirs bothers you.

That and her whole love speech in that movie were infuriating but other that that I think it was a masterpiece. This scene is absolutely necessary and had time constraints to a 3 hour movie. I let it go because he is selling this to the public and things need to be explained to them. He cannot just assume everyone is up on their science game.  

Cooper should really already know this stuff, considering the whole mission revolves around him being able to fly through a wormhole.

ehh  

Another point that can be argued to be objective. There is what the industry produced, and there is the comparison of what he does to that that delineates whether or not he was creative. He is.   

The other two yeah but this one no.  

The other two yeah? You just responded in so many words "no". Are you drunk. But again, this is a testament to his creativity. Inception has spectacular attention to detail in plot flow and also jumped around in levels of a dream. Not only was that fucking creative, we can all wait for any suggestions on how it could be smoother. Tick tock....

	<TEXT> It's a never ending battle.  

It feels like it yes. Right around a year you will realize you are a new person. You wont know when it happened, you wont be able to pinpoint it, you will just know it was a long journey. 

First and foremost, get regular therapy. If you cannot afford it, go to AA. It has A LOT of problems but the most significant thing about it is hearing other people talk and, here is the hard part, sharing yourself. Talking it out is 90% of psychotherapy. 

Exercise, and do it every day. Intense cardio for 40 minutes, no excuses. The insanity videos are great for this. You will feel like you are going to die, I promise you, but don't allow any excuses. Exercise is the single more effective tool you can use. I am alive today because of it.  Read this.

[Spark](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain-ebook/dp/B000SFD21Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1489951001 sr=1-1 keywords=spark)

Read all the science about it you can. Know what is going on in your brain. So much easier to ignore the voice in your head when you know why you have it. You judge yourself less and know it is just an anomaly of of an evolutionary process hijacked by a substance.  Read these to start.

[The Chemical Carousel](https://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Carousel-Science-Beating-Addiction/dp/1439212996)

You have to attack this from all fronts. Relapse is part of it. DO NOT judge yourself for relapse. Get back to it and set your goals. Exercise every day, talk to someone every day, get therapy every week.  Eat right. Omega 3 and probiotics are huge. Also a vitiman called "Stress" of some form. They are high combos of B multi and C. Take it. 

The battle ends. You just can never drink again. I promise you, when you go at life without, you develop. You are stressed, you recover, you are stressed you recover. Every thing you used to do drinking you will knock out of the park sober. You just cannot avoid ANYTHING that scares you. You will be the better you and learn to deal.  

Hope this helps.

	<TEXT>  Hate crimes aren't thought crimes. This ridiculous.

That wasn't my claim. You began by misrepresenting what I said. Fantastic. Hate is the thought that is smuggling into a crime like assault. Assault is the crime. 

We sentence people differently for the same crime depending on the victim and impact on society all the time.  

We sentence people on the severity and type of their crime. We classify intent, premeditation, and outcome. Not the thoughts of the perpetrator since they are impossible to prove in a court of law.  

 Is it assault or child abuse or domestic violence? Depends on who the victim is  

Are you arguing for my side now? Child abuse depends on age, not how much the person disliked the victim. Your second example, the same. Murder and terrorism are a horrible analogy because there can be terrorism without murder. This is all incoherent and irrelevant to anything I said. 

The law treats actions differently all the time.  

That is how we classify the crime, not the opinion of the person towards the victim. This is what I said before and this is the confusion where you either purposefully misrepresented my opinion or just don't understand. I think we know which.   

People only get pissy about it when criminal law is protecting people based on protected status, which again happens in all other areas of law.  

What?  

Feel free to have the last word. I don't have time to refute and sort out strings of irrelevant, conflated, and misrepresentations of my opinion. This will never work for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Calling me threatened is way easier than refuting my opinion. You probably can, you probably have the superior argument, but you just choose to withhold it. Right? Sure.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Scum for pointing out what a shit person is doing to our country?

No, the scum reference was directed at overall behavior on both side to which this was an example and I stated reasons why. None of which were this. You are not good at this. 

Scum for proving how his vacations to his properties to make a buck can be used in different ways that HELP the poor and downtrodden?  

Here we go with the virtue signaling. I stated my case and you are addressing a straw man. 

Scum for knowing this buffoon of a man is soiling the country we live in for money?  

You are exhausting. I disagree with the majority, the vast majority of what he does. People are scum for lying about it and making it more difficult to condemn. 

Here is some advice. These tactics you are using will never work for you. You alienate people on your side trying to virtue signal and demonize others who are clarifying reality and actually are on your side. This is the scumminess I am referring to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It does put things into perspective.

My entire point is that comparing it to victims is the farthest thing from perspective and I also stated why.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the dumbest way to critique his wasting of money. Attack the legitimacy of his trips, stop bringing victims into the equation. This is as stupid as if the GOP did it for any spending they disagree with. I am so sick of both sides, you're all scum.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still think this is insane. Hate crimes are nonsense. He committed a crime. Assessing his thoughts on a race are irrelevant. He should be charged with assault. Hate speech is not a crime, nor should it be. (Happy to admit I am wrong on this, as far as I know it is not). making hateful speech illegal is akin to thought crime. 

The degrees of murder have nothing to do with how the murder feels about the person, they delineate intent and planning. 1st premeditated, intentional, 2nd: not premeditated, intentional, Voluntary:  intentional with provocation, not premeditated, and Involuntary: Unintentional, not premeditated, and responsible for actions that resulted in a death. I may be off on a few things, but I am close. The person's hatred is irrelevant. People are sentenced on the severity of the crime and possibility of recidivism. 

Hate crimes are just smuggling in thought crimes and calling it something different. The institutional virtue signal. You don't stop bad ideas with enforcement and violating civil rights, you stop them with better ideas. If you cannot argue the case against racism, then go home, you don't belong in the conversation. If you think a racist cannot be talked out of it, then the fault is on you. After conversation comes violence. People who support nonsense like this are not responsible for racism, they are responsible for keeping it alive and suffocating the only thing that can kill it, reason.  </TEXT>
