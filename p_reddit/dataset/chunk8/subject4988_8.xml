	<TEXT> That should be totally fine! Just remember that if you're looking for a physics Ph.D., you'll want to demonstrate your ability to do research. Being able to create a software pipeline or optimize Monte Carlo simulations or process images is a nice addition to your standard physics (+ math) skill set. But if you spend your summer internships developing in Haskell or something, then physics grad schools might not care too much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I study astrophysics, not particle physics. That being said, I share an office with a high energy theorist (grand unified theories/string theories) and a high energy experimentalist (CMS at CERN), and I once was interested in doing particle physics. What you'll want to do depends on whether you wish to study theory or experiment.

It also depends on what year of school you're in. By the end of your third year of undergrad, you'll want to have a solid understanding of linear algebra, classical mechanics (*Mechanics* by Landau   Lifshitz) and quantum mechanics (Sakurai). Statistical mechanics can also be helpful for learning quantum field theory, and I'd recommend checking out Griffith's *Introduction to Elementary Particles*, as /u/counterfriction mentioned, as a good "for dummies" book. I'd also recommend *Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur* by Lancaster   Blundell as a very approachable introduction to QFT. It is far easier to understand than Peskin   Schroeder or Zee, and is written by experimentalists who are very careful to explain and motivate everything they say--nothing is to be inferred in the first few chapters (and then they wean you off). *QFT for the Gifted Amateur* is probably worth self-studying your 4th year of undergrad or first year of grad, and then you'll probably spend another two semesters learning out of Peskin   Schroeder or Srednicki in graduate school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I'm exactly like this! I constantly hop between quantum field theory + associated mathematics, machine learning, learning new programming languages, and my actual research (extragalactic astronomy). I think it's a great thing to enjoy a diverse range of subjects so long as you can be productive and eventually an expert in one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe that it reaches a critical angle, which is determined by the spaghetti's composition, at which point it snaps rather than continues to straighten out the segment. Perhaps that is why the spaghetti strand sometimes breaks into three or more pieces as well: the multiplicity of broken pieces would then be equal to the INTEGER(total bending angle / critical angle). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a good question. The emission that we see in this image is at radio frequencies (353, 545 and 857 GHz) and is probably due to an unresolved point-like, synchrotron radiation source. I don't know too much about stuff going on in our own Milky Way galaxy, but if I were to guess, I'd say that the dot is a supernova remnant named [Cassiopeia A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_A). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've even had my professors do this. I personally call it "nabla" because I use it so often in LaTeX. I used to call it "del," but many of my friends infuriatingly say "del" when they mean d (in derivatives or partial derivatives) or delta, so I try to avoid using "del" to mean a third thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi OP, helping my friends in my physics class is what got me first interested in high school (freshman year). Now, nine years later (I'm a second year Ph.D. student), I'm studying physics for a career. You never know!

Teaching was my primary motivation, but then curiosity about stuff (relativity, particle physics, cosmology, and currently galaxy formation/evolution) got me way more interested. Doing original research was what solidified my decision to go to graduate school and stick with (astro)physics for life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah actually I did my undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon (where I got a 3.23/4.00). I'm currently doing a Ph.D. in astrophysics at Rutgers and came straight here after undergrad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The third sentence in the abstract mentions "proto-super-cluster voids". I have no idea what that's supposed to mean; clusters have high density and voids have low density. I tried to read a little further but the article is very obscure to me.

To answer your question--sound's like he is crazy to me. </TEXT>
