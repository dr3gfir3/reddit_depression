	<TITLE> The r/books bookclub pick for February is Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-28 02:04:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We are really excited for this as our bookclub pick.  Many of us have read this already and we enjoyed it quite a bit even though we often enjoy very different books.  This crosses lines between genres and appeals to those who like more literary fiction as well as sci fi fans.  

Jeff has done an [AMA here in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3es2af/im_jeff_vandermeer_the_author_of_the_southern/) (Spoilers!) and I encourage you to check that out if you have already ready The Southern Reach Trilogy.  If you have already read Annihilation I encourage you to read it again.

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530-annihilation):

Area X has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; all the members of the second expedition committed suicide; the third expedition died in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another; the members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within months of their return, all had died of aggressive cancer.

This is the twelfth expedition.

Their group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain and collect specimens; to record all their observations, scientific and otherwise, of their surroundings and of one another; and, above all, to avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.

They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X deliversthey discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understandingbut its the surprises that came across the border with them, and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another, that change everything. </TEXT>
