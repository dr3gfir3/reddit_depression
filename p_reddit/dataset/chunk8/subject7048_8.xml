	<TEXT> Well I just realized that I have been using this trap for a good time already, but it just won't fit the purpouse. I was thinking more of a prison-kind of trap, so they can run in a small area but won't leave it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does naming them worsen my prognosis? 
It's really bad that I have to create thousands of names though. They always find a way to escape, like passing through the walls or breaking the door.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't seem to reproduce the White Noise in this music, seems like it's bandswept and got a nice pristine sound:

https://soundcloud.com/mitis/mitis-life-of-sin 
Starts at 0:30 and goes along through the chorus 
Or 3:49 

Any help would be awesome.
Cheers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm getting disconnected all of my games, even though my internet is doing fine and I can play any other games without having trouble. Maybe it's a router problem, not sure. This issue never happened before (250+ hours of CSGO) and just started this month.
Can a blessed soul help me out?!

	<TEXT> Sorry, but the one TRUE king would be Stannis really. He is not a Targaryen (technically speaking, he is, but from a really distant parenteage bloodline), but since Robert TOOK the Iron Throne from Aerys in battle, it doesn't belong anymore to the Targaryen House until they fight to get it back. 
Jon Snow is not the One True King even though I believe he would fit perfectly at the role.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [MAIN SPOILERS] How will this confirmed theory unfold over the next season? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Has anyone thought about how will Jon prove his parentage though? Would anyone actually believe in the word of the time-traveller Bran, the (seemingly) only one who knows about his past? 

Wielding the "Targaryen" surname can reasonably give any man power: the right for the Iron Throne and a good bunch of supporting people (the dornishmen, for example, apparently are still willing to do so, as many others); so questioning the veracity of it would be primary right? Otherwise anyone would allege to be from the House. 

The only way to prove it would have to be putting Jon to a test. Or maybe one of Daenerys dragons will get attached to him implying that he's from the same bloodline. 

Thoughts? </TEXT>
