	<TEXT> If you keep that up they'll limit your account (providing you do it online). My mate Wayne Bailey that writes for the Indo, he had his account limited to something like 19c per bet.  

Mine was similar - I think it was 12c per bet. I asked them for a copy of every bet I placed on the account, and I was up close to 7 grand over 3 years.... which really amounts to fuck all when you think about it.  

This was with Powers. After that I did all my betting on Betfair... 

I closed my Betfair account when I moved to the states. Haven't bothered to keep up with the horses since then, although I will try to watch Cheltenham every year. I was never big into betting that week anyway and usually watched it for the craic. 

I do miss the horses though. Ended up having shares in two horses and that was great craic. The racing in the states is pure cack though, so I've no interest in it these days.

	<TEXT>  He definitely had a soft spot for the Kurds, and never spent enough time clarifying that the invasion of Iraq could have been a well executed, justified mission, but that it wasn't. He never acknowledges it was terribly executed and that the humanitarian/terror crises haven't been improved post-invasion.

I disagree with this. I hope I don't come across as a wanker, but it seems to me that you haven't read enough of Hitchens' writing, if you think he never acknowledged how badly executed it was. He held the US accountable all along the way. 

Have you read his pamphlet on Iraq? Have you watched his debates on Iraq? Have you read this? https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/14/christopher-hitchens-cancer-interview

Hitchens wasn't wrong on Iraq. It was going to implode pretty soon anyway, and it was important that the US had some say in how that implosion went. He argued that the US was pulling out too soon and didn't do enough to help the Iraqi people. That's on the US, not on Hitchens.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I left the country in 2011, and back then it was bad but not *terrible* however I know there's loads of people on trolleys in corridors now, often dying in them in as well. My sister's husband had a first cousin that died on a trolley from a heart attack something like 36 hours after being referred for a suspected heart attack from his GP and he was never looked at. I think this happened around 2012.  

Anyway, the reason I ask is my sister is having a four/five hour surgery today. She was brought in last night and spent the night on a trolley in a corridor.... there's no bed for her after the surgery so she'll be going back to the corridor for post-op recovery. She has VHI as well, not that it matters - there's just no beds because of all the hospitals in the region that the government decided to close.  

She's in Limerick regional, but I'm sure it's the same story all over. Is anyone in government committed to opening more hospitals?  

Sorry I realise this is probably discussed ad nauseum on the news but I haven't been tuning into RTE too often from over here. </TEXT>

This shit has to stop. It's a fucking domestic competition. They say this shit every year.  

"Well if they played any team they would win so they are world champions".  

Oh so I could create a sport that only I play and claim to be a world champion? No.  

The NFL is the National Football League for fucks sake. National being the key word. It's a domestic sport, a domestic competition. It's not nations competing from every continent so you're not world champions you arrogant wankers.

	<TEXT> I probably should have added why I was making the argument in the first place. I'm from Ireland, and a vast majority of people I know back home in Europe blame US intervention for the creation of Islamic terrorism. My aim was to show it existed prior to the US existing, with the example of Baltimore, Jeffersons writing, and then to show what ISIS really want because regular folks haven't read their propaganda.

I should expand on this.

	<TEXT> **DEATHS**  

1) **John (Jackie) Duddy**. Shot in the chest in the car park of Rossville flats. Four witnesses stated Duddy was unarmed and running away from the paratroopers when he was killed. Three of them saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth as he ran. His nephew is Irish boxer John Duddy.[31]  
2) **Patrick Joseph Doherty**. Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety in the forecourt of Rossville flats. Doherty was the subject of a series of photographs, taken before and after he died by French journalist Gilles Peress. Despite testimony from "Soldier F" that he had fired at a man holding and firing a pistol, Widgery acknowledged that the photographs showed Doherty was unarmed, and that forensic tests on his hands for gunshot residue proved negative.[31][34]  
3) **Bernard McGuigan**. Shot in the back of the head when he went to help Patrick Doherty. He had been waving a white handkerchief at the soldiers to indicate his peaceful intentions.[4]  
4) **Hugh Pius Gilmour**. Shot through his right elbow, the bullet then entering his chest as he ran from the paratroopers on Rossville Street.[31] Widgery acknowledged that a photograph taken seconds after Gilmour was hit corroborated witness reports that he was unarmed, and that tests for gunshot residue were negative.[4]  
5) **Kevin McElhinney**. Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety at the front entrance of the Rossville Flats. Two witnesses stated McElhinney was unarmed.[31]  
6) **Michael Gerald Kelly**. Shot in the stomach while standing near the rubble barricade in front of Rossville Flats. Widgery accepted that Kelly was unarmed.[31]  
7) **John Pius Young**. Shot in the head while standing at the rubble barricade. Two witnesses stated Young was unarmed.[31]  
8) **William Noel Nash**. Shot in the chest near the barricade. Witnesses stated Nash was unarmed and going to the aid of another when killed.[31]  
9) **Michael M. McDaid**. Shot in the face at the barricade as he was walking away from the paratroopers. The trajectory of the bullet indicated he could have been killed by soldiers positioned on the Derry Walls.[31]  
10) **William Anthony McKinney**. Shot through the upper right back, with the bullet then exiting through his lower left chest[35] as he attempted to flee through Glenfada Park.[36][37]  
11) **James Joseph Wray**. Wounded then shot again at close range while lying on the ground. Witnesses who were not called to the Widgery Tribunal stated that Wray was calling out that he could not move his legs before he was shot the second time.[31]  
12) **Gerald Donaghey**. Shot in the stomach while attempting to run to safety between Glenfada Park and Abbey Park. Donaghey was brought to a nearby house by bystanders where he was examined by a doctor. His pockets were turned out in an effort to identify him. A later police photograph of Donaghey's corpse showed nail bombs in his pockets. Neither those who searched his pockets in the house nor the British army medical officer (Soldier 138) who pronounced him dead shortly afterwards say they saw any bombs. Donaghey had been a member of Fianna ireann, an IRA-linked Republican youth movement.[31] Paddy Ward, a police informer[38] who gave evidence at the Saville Inquiry, claimed that he had given two nail bombs to Donaghey several hours before he was shot dead.[39]  
13) **Gerard (James) McKinney**. Shot just after Gerald Donaghey. Witnesses stated that McKinney had been running behind Donaghey, and he stopped and held up his arms, shouting "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!", when he saw Donaghey fall. He was then shot in the chest.[31]  
14) **John Johnston**. Shot in the leg and left shoulder on William Street 15 minutes before the rest of the shooting started.[31][40] Johnston was not on the march, but on his way to visit a friend in Glenfada Park.[40] He died 4 months later; his death has been attributed to the injuries he received on the day. He was the only one not to die immediately or soon after being shot.[31]

	<TEXT> Fair play /u/JebNorth this is great to see. I'm a fairly avid reader so I would have some interest in this. I'll join in every so often. 

I'm not trying to sound like a wanker by not fully committing, it's just that I've already set myself up to read 80 fucking books this year. I managed 56 last year, so I'm aiming for 80 this time around. So If I join in here I'd be removing some of the ones I already picked out. 

I'm starting a new job on the 23rd and the job should free me up quite a bit. In 2014 I managed to read something like 150 books when the job I had was fairly easy going for that year. 

Most of the 80 books I want to read this year are re-reads from that list of 150, because I ploughed through them and I've forgotten quite a bit of them at this stage. The idea is to read them and make some notes - so something like this where you discuss each book would be fucking ideal man.

	<TEXT> More than 45 million people, or 14.5 percent of all Americans, lived below the poverty line last year.

1.2 Trillion / 45 million = 26666.666 (note the number - hah).  

If you give  26666.666 to every person below the poverty line, they wouldn't be below the poverty line anymore. It literally is enough to solve poverty in this country, as the poverty line for a 1 person home is $14,720.  

So the industry has enough tax free money to solve poverty ever year, but does fuck all - why? Because poor people are typically uneducated and they are easy to manipulate.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In order to keep track of how long certain tasks took - like calling a web service, or transfering a file we typically do the following:
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    // some action
    long duration = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
    statistics.put("ACTION_TIME", duration);

I found Apache Common's StopWatch, but ultimately ran into threading issues as it's not threadsafe.  

I wrote a thread-safe alternative... but I consider it a bit of a hack and wanted to know how you great folks do the above in a threadsafe manner?

	<TEXT> Hi lads/ladies,

I'm considering putting together a small website with a database to keep track of arrests and allow us to query for various metrics.

Having it linked in with Google maps would be a plus, especially for Pastors arrested for child related offences - highlighting nearby schools, etc.

I'm hoping this would get this issue the attention it deserves.

Other than a site, with a DB and Google maps integration, is there anything else you'd like to see on there? I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas on this.

**EDIT** Apologies for the lack of progress on this. I'm in the middle of buying a house and the whole mortgage process is fucking terrible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not at all. I used to when I was a child, as I was indoctrinated as most people are/were. I was even an alter boy (by choice) for a few years as a child as well. The last service I performed was my grandfather's funeral which was quite beautiful. He was the mayor of our small town of 9000 people or so, and close to 1000 attended the funeral.  

I've studied various religions for a long time now; over twenty years at this point, focusing mostly on the three monotheism's but not limited to those three. I've read lots about Buddhism for example, and I often meditate for short periods and practice mindfulness as it's extremely useful but that religion itself is hogwosh (my opnion of course, this whole post is).  

I've read the works of Hitchens, Dawkins, Dennet, Krauss, Paine, Spinoza, and so on. Their work is very compelling. There's lots of debates with Hitchens as well, and if you haven't seen any of those I encourage you to check them out.  

The bible is an awfully violent book and it's clear that it was made up by man, not the word of god. Paine made a great case for this - cities changed names for example, and a story in the bible was supposed to have been written   recorded in time n, and then in n+800 years the town's name changed to x, but the bible has the town's name recorded as the name from n+800, not the original name.... so it can't have been written when it was claimed. That's just one example of many.  

I also abhor the thought that there is an totalitarian regime up there watching everything one does and says, and judges you. That's just disgusting really. It's all nonsense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When Christopher Hitchens was diagnosed with cancer, he wrote a collection of essays for his various columns with Vanity Fair, Slate, etc which are collected into a book called Mortality.  

It's a great read for anyone that has a fear of dying and/or death.  

He wasn't afraid of the process, but he didn't like that the party went on without him. The thought that papers would come out the day after he died and he would have no idea what was written in them. I thought this was an interesting perspective.  

Nothing really scares me about it. I look forward to it in a way. Obviously dying too soon is something I want to avoid, I don't want to give my family/friends unnecessary grief. 

The thought of thinking for ALL ETERNITY scares me crap out of me, so I look forward to dying and being just like it was before I was born. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was actually in Glenwood Avenue in Raleigh. I live out the road from it :)

They handled it better this time because the snow didn't hit before lads left the office, it hit late at night so nobody needed to be on the roads.  

It's bad enough though, we got ice, then snow, then ice again. It's very dangerous. I have friends that moved to Canada trying to take the piss, but without winter tyres, salt on the roads, and ploughs they'd be in the same boat we are.  

Doesn't matter a fuck, ice is ice you can't drive on it. I lived further north and lived through loads of blizzards. It was safer up there than here. </TEXT>

Finished Fawlty Towers recently.... so good. It's a shame it was so short though!

Black Books is probably my favourite UK comedy, after Father Ted which I consider Irish despite being run on Channel 4 - it did air on Irish TV first before Channel 4 picked it up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got my honours BSc in Ireland for "free". I paid 700 euro per year, and that was it. Those were "admin fees".  

I am forever grateful for this. I live in the states now and my wife has student debt, like most other people. 

I had to sit exams to get into college - I couldn't just walk into it. At the end of secondary school (high school), I sat exams in every subject I was taking, and how I did determined which schools I could get into. The exam structure was the same as college exam structures as well, so it was great training for college/university.  

Does anyone know if this is something Sanders supports - "free" education for all who are capable - means tested by examinations/education?
