	<TITLE> Here's the stupidest thing yet that a politician has said about the mass DDoS attacks that took down "the internet" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-22 21:54:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ever since the mass DDoS attacks yesterday that took down "the Internet," I've been trying to keep track of all the blatantly incorrect, misleading, fear mongering statements that members of Congress and other officials have made. (Disclosure: I work for [a nonprofit](fightforthefuture.org) that fights bad Internet legislation like CISA.)

It's been tough to choose, but there's one that stands out as the most ridiculous:

Tennessee's Representative Marsha Blackburn [went on CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-yJbac48m4 feature=youtu.be) shortly after the attacks and implied that the Internet outage could have been prevented by a bill called SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, which you may remember because it was resoundingly rejected after [mass protests](https://www.sopastrike.com/numbers/) as TERRIBLE idea that would have lead to widespread internet censorship. It also had absolutely *nothing* to do with preventing cyber attacks. Even its proponents would agree that it was about copyright enforcement, not digital security. It certainly did nothing to hold companies accountable for improving the security of consumer technology products, which is what [actually would](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/double-dip-internet-of-things-botnet-attack-felt-across-the-internet/) prevent attacks like this.

Blackburn went on to blame free speech advocates for having stopped SOPA, and even went so far as to call us ... wait for it ... CYBERBOTS!!!

Do you care about free speech? If so, you're a cyberbot too. Cyberbots unite! Let's remember that many politicians barely understand how the Internet works. We can't let them exploit these recent attacks to push for bad legislation. [More here.](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/789590696806248448) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey... Evan Greer here. I'd be more than happy to talk you through the specifics of how the TPP hurts all of us. Give me a buzz? evangreer@gmail.com

A basic summary:
-It's more than 5,000 pages long, most of those pages have nothing to do with trade
-The Investor State Dispute Settlement section provides multinational corporations with a way to undermine basic democratic process, fining governments for basic things like labor standards, environmental protections, etc.
-It exports the U.S.'s broken copyright system to other countries, expanding Internet censorship, without required protections for Fair Use / free speech
-It jacks up the cost of generic medicine, disproportionately affecting LGBTQ people and poor people
-It harshens penalties for Whistleblowers and journalists reporting on corporate abuse in its "trade secrets" section
-It undermines labor standards globally, making it easier for companies to send jobs to wherever wages are lowest

There's so may other things. All of this is easily sourced with a google search. hit me up with questions, for real.  </TEXT>
