	<TEXT> I would venture to say that episode is not reflective of the rest of the show. There are definitely some disturbing + morose episodes, and overall the show is fairly dark, but something about that pig episode was "next level" in a way that the others are not. I think a lot of people are turned off (literally) by that episode and bail earlier than they should - the rest of the episodes are much more Twilight Zone than that episode is. Jumping right to season 3 and then going back to watch the first two seasons might actually be the safest move. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn, this is a dream of mine, too - a very distant one. Happy for you that you pulled it off! Is there a small town nearby? If so, during your first year, be sure to walk into town, find a good looking gal/guy, memorize their schedule, and then talk to them (and only them) every single day, sometimes giving them odd gifts. The townspeople might think you're a weirdo for wandering into town once a day and only talking to the same person, but eventually you'll have a husband or wife, so it's worth it. Also take a peek in the trash cans (don't get caught). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two ways:

1. By choosing a book with a serious hook - typically, for me, that's a mystery, a sci-fi book with a great premise, or a well-rated horror novel. I try to push myself and expand my reading horizons throughout they year, but those three genres are fallbacks for me, so if I ever feel the slump, I look to them for relief.

2. By realizing if I've set a goal that's a bit too ambitious and that I'm burning myself out trying to reach it instead of enjoying the books I read. I shot for 75 last year because I was crushing books between January and April, but at a certain point I got tired of keeping up that pace. It became "work" to stay on top of my reading goal - I was no longer really enjoying it. So I said screw it, and dropped my goal down to 50. I wound up reading 56 books, which is probably 50 more than the average person reads in a year, so I definitely didn't feel like a slacker. Basically, if you aren't enjoying the pace, there's no reason to feel bad about adjusting it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only got about halfway through TNotW - I was not a huge fan. I get that it's *his* story and so he's going to be a bit of a Mary Sue since he's talking himself up, but it got annoying after awhile. It was also extremely heavy on exposition, such as when it explained the currency system and how magic works. It just didn't feel organic; I didn't feel like I was being dropped into the world in the way that really good fantasy pulls off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I feel that an official spokesperson for the White House should be held to a higher standard than a random person on the street, don't you? It's literally his job to speak on behalf of the White House and he's had several significant goofs already. His holding the position makes the White House looks scattered and disorganized because his briefings are scattered, disorganized, and sometimes off-message (when there *is* a clear message from the White House, which is only some of the time). I watch the briefings from start to finish live nearly every day, for what it's worth - not just clips of them posted online.

As far as the "conflation" between bombings and the refugee situation - I think the actual content of what you're referring to is that it's a bit tough to take Trump seriously and at his word that he had a sudden change of heart on Syrian children and beautiful babies when his policies on allowing refugees from that same country to enter the country are still designed to prevent it. That's not a conflation, it's an apparent contradiction on Trump's part. If he was really deeply moved by the footage he saw on CNN, he would reconsider his policy on Syrian immigration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watch the press briefings live almost every day, and I'm constantly amazed at Spicer's inability to speak clearly - he stumbles and stammers and goofs pretty much every other sentence. It might seem petty to call that out, but he's a freaking *spokesperson*, so you'd figure he could speak. Personally, do you feel it matters that the White House have a clear communicator as their spokesperson, or is it not all that important?

I agree that he has a hard job considering the mixed messages constantly coming from the White House. At the same time, he's generated some of those himself. It seems to me that the real issue is that they need someone to take charge of the message and make sure everyone is on the same page, because it certainly seems like no one is doing that right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you look at the thread from /r/AskTrumpSupporters yesterday, many of them believe he's already done more in 90 days than Obama did in 8 years. They link to a "track trump" site which gives him "in-progress" credit for a bunch of things that may or may not even wind up happening - but if he signed something "starting" them, they count it. For example, the travel ban (blocked by the courts), pipelines (conveniently doesn't show that he broke his promise on American steel), the wall (hasn't even had funding approved for it), and on and one. The three substantive things he has done are withdrawing from the TPP, making deportation easier, and getting Gorsuch on the bench. And bombing Syria I guess, but we'll have to see how that plays out, and he explicitly said he wasn't going to do that stuff - of course, the tracker doesn't reflect that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a really interesting book BUT don't expect a traditional mystery - the mystery is sort of background for the actual story being told. I wouldn't necessarily say he uses mathematical puzzles and riddles to solve the mystery, either - rather, he understands the world through numbers and images, so they are frequently used throughout the book since he is the narrator. Great book - just don't want you to have skewed expectations! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Infinite Jest is great - but don't be surprised (or distraught) if it's mid-July and you're still working on it! I read it over the course of 3 months last year and really enjoyed it - it's not as "hard" as it's made out to be, it's more a matter of determination because of the length of time it takes to read it. Well worth it in my opinion. It will start to make more and more sense as you go along - you just sort of have to let yourself absorb details as you read the first couple of hundred pages - and then things start to click. That was one of the most rewarding parts of the book for me - it makes so little sense at the beginning, and makes more and more sense as you go along. Enjoy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You might like a story collection called The Weird: A Compendium of Strange and Dark Tales. There are over 100 awesome short stories that defy traditional horror norms (like, they aren't about vampires, werewolves, etc - they're about a wide range of creepy, disturbing, or uncanny experiences and events). It's easily one of the best collections I've ever purchased and it has a Lovecraft story in there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This week I read **Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World** by Haruki Murakami. Holy cow, what a book. It was a mind-fuck. The writing style and the content meshed perfectly, and I will be thinking about it for a long time. What a deep, dark, satisfying, mysterious, troubling book. After finishing it, all I want to do is read more by this author, so Im extremely happy he has so many books for me to read. I think the next one Ill read is Kafka on the Shore.

Between now and when Kafka arrives in my mailbox, I will read **In the Dust of This Planet - Horror of Philosophy Vol. 1**. I started it this week and its a quickie, but I absolutely love it so far. I am a huge fan of horror, so reading about the intersection of horror and philosophy has been great. Ive already added a ton to my list of to-watch / read as well. The most interesting concept Ive come across so far is that there are really three ways we conceive of the world: Theres the world as it relates to us (known as The World), theres the world-as-it-is (i.e. everything we know about PLUS everything we dont - know as The Earth) and then there is The Planet, the world-without-us. The Planet suddenly zooms us way out to see our World as just another among many planets - something that was around long before us and which will be around long after were gone. Part of the thesis of this book is that horror is a non-pjhilosophical attempt to think about the world-without-us philosophically. If youre a horror fan I recommend checking this book out. Neat stuff so far.

	<TEXT> Trump talks this way about most strong-man types. He said good things about Duterte in the Philippines. He invited Egypt's leader to the White House despite him being barred during Obama's tenure. Trump admires strongmen, that's basically the root of it.

I do think there was collusion - but I could easily see it happening without Trump's involvement. Roger Stone, Carter Page, Manafort - those are pretty shady fuckers who may have just done things on their own. With Kushner getting tied in it does seem to be a bit closer to home though. I am hesitant to make any solid guesses. </TEXT>

I get the temptation to try to link this to collusion with Russia, but more than likely, there was collusion between Trump's team and Russian agents which Trump himself didn't participate all that much in or perhaps didn't know about. To suggest that all of this is a plotted, schemed out cover-up attempt is really beyond absurd - as much so as 9/11 conspiracy theories. Most of the time these things are what they look like they are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's just strange how often /r/the_donald parrots the Russian talking points on an issue, is all. I can totally understand being anti-war - at the very least, more time should have taken before this strike was ordered. But the sub was PACKED with false flag narrative posts. That's different than simply being anti-war - it's the actual Russian angle on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unmask means the names were revealed to the national security adviser upon her request. It doesn't mean they were leaked or that the people whose names were unmasked were the targets of the surveillance. In fact, it means the opposite. It means that they met with people who WERE under surveillance. Say the Russian ambassador meets with a Trump transition team member at a coffee shop. If that ambassador was under surveillance, the surveillance is also going to pick up the person he's meeting with. If that person is a US citizen, their identity is masked. In order to get context or if it's needed for security purposes, those identities can be unmasked AKA revealed to the national security adviser upon request. So like I said, it comes nowhere close to meaning Trump or his team were spied on. It means they MET with people who were being spied on and appeared on those tapes / recordings / transcripts / etc - that is the meaning of incidental surveillance. You, too, could be picked up in incidental surveillance if you're, say, the barista at that coffee shop where the Russian ambassador is meeting with a Trump associate. Doesn't mean you're the target of the surveillance or that you're being spied on - it means you're in a place where someone else is being spied on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No idea proposed by Rand Paul is going to lead to lower premiums and universal coverage. The freedom caucus opposed the bill because it didn't go FAR enough in removing protections and coverage. So no, that won't be popular either, expect maybe among the Trump supporters who aren't paying attention to what's actually in the bill. (note - not saying ALL trump supporters won't pay attention to what's in the bill - just saying that only the percentage of them who aren't paying attention it it will support it)

My larger point is that Republican ideas aren't actually popular or good for the working class, and we're going to see that more and more as they bring legislation to the table. People forgot just how bought the Republican party is. They're about to be reminded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think anyone thinks the battle is won just because Nunes stepped down. That's one small step in draining Trump's swamp - there are many more battles to be fought and won along the way. 2018 will be just another stepping stone. It's not even remotely proven Trump was wiretapped, nor even suggested by the evidence. Trump's team was caught up in lawful incidental surveillance, meaning they met with people being monitored by the government. Nothing about that suggests Trump was wiretapped. Even "unmasking" identities comes nowhere close to that - partly because the identities aren't know until they're unmasked anyways. Hard to call it targeted when the identities of the people weren't known until they were unmasked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally I think the opposite is happening - people are finally waking up to how unpopular and undesirable a lot of Republican ideas are, now that Republicans have to govern instead of just oppose. The AHCA had a 17% approval rating. People want the pipe dream promises of Trump, where everyone gets covered and insurance is cheaper. Republican ideas don't get you there. The Republicans just passed a horribly unpopular piece of legislation on ISPs. Their ideas really aren't very good for the average person, and people will vote accordingly when they realize that. Likely in 2018. </TEXT>

How many people would die of starvation or exposure due to blockades or embargoes or non-functioning shipping routes is one thing that would have to be considered.

	<TEXT> OK, if it was an extenuating circumstance of the nature you say it may have been above, why constantly lie and say it was because of the audit instead of simply explaining it? The truth is that he made a decision not to release them - we don't know why - but he didn't want to, and the audit is the excuse his team came up with. The one he stuck with despite it being demonstrated to be a false excuse.

[Do you think Kellyanne Conway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYhdFVYYnZQ), who is a counselor for the president, doesn't take direction from the White House? She's the one who said he wouldn't release them and that it was "litigated in the election". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The IRS specifically said he was free to release the returns. There is no reason whatsoever, not extenuating circumstances, nothing, that prevented him from releasing the returns. It's a lie. Here are several of the times he said he's release them - keep in mind that the audit is not in any way preventing him from releasing the returns:

February 25, 2015: "I would release tax returns....I would certainly show tax returns if it was necessary....I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns."

January 24, 2016: "We're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful, and we'll be working that over in the next period of time....We're working on it right now, and at the appropriate time you'll be very satisfied."

February 25, 2016: "I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously."

May 10, 2016: "I'll release. Hopefully before the election I'll release."

September 26, 2016: "I don't mind releasingI'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released....As soon as the audit's finished, it will be released."

October 9, 2016: "As soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns. I'll be very proud to. They're actually quite great."

And after the election, he had surrogates say bluntly that because he won, he won't release them. Ever. And he said himself that no one cares and no one but journalists want to see them. That isn't true either. Plenty of people still want to see them. This person is a prolific liar.

I mention April 15th because that's the day after tax day. Unless I'm wrong, on that day he could release at least 2016's taxes (without violating his own (invalid, made up, false) rule about being under audit). If I'm wrong about that, OK, I'm wrong about that. Nothing about me being wrong about that changes the numerious lies and exuses provided by Trump for not releasing his tax returns. Call some of the above examples "exuses" rather than lies if it makes you feel better. Some of them are invalid exuses (which, after they're proven invalid, become lies if you keep repeating them as if they're valid) and some are flat lies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About not being allowed to release his tax returns because he's under audit - that was a lie. He also promised numerous times to release them at some future point, but then after getting elected, just said he wasn't going to anymore. Another lie. It's even possible he wasn't under audit at all because when journalists requested to see his audit letter, they were directed to his attorneys who just said he was under audit, but wouldn't produce the simple audit letter. The guy lies constantly. On April 15th the audit excuse (which makes no sense since he's legally allowed to release them while under audit anyways) will no longer be valid, but he's already stated he won't release them anyways. He's a liar. </TEXT>
