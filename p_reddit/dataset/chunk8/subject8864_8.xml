	<TEXT> A little about myself.  I wake up at 6:30am, get to school, stay at the library from 7:30am to 1:30pm.  Head back home at 3:00pm.  I'm so tired from thinking that I nap from 3:00 to 6:00 pm.  Then from 6pm to midnight I'm so fatigued from napping that I essentially watch Netflix and TV.  I have no problem getting to sleep though, but my I'm fatigued the entire time I'm awake.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually have a BA in physics, and I'm currently working on my MS in math.  My school doesn't have a PhD program, so I'm applying to one this season.

I actually applied to a PhD program twice after my BA in physics.  After being rejected by everyone for the first two rounds.  I was completely traumatized and went for a job in industry.  Then after leaving industry, I decided to get my masters degree.

I think I'm still left with the sense of rejection I felt the first two rounds of applying for graduate school.  I'm applying for math instead of physics this time, but there's always the possibility of no one accepting me.  I guess it's not too bad if I apply again after getting my degree, but there's always the fear lingering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see what you're saying in the value of going slow.  Paradoxically in my graduate career, everyone around you is telling you to go faster.  I'm wondering if you feel this pressure to be fast? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply.  I'm not doing any strength training or cardio.  I can't find the time or motivation to do it, even though I know i should.

I constantly feel like I'm behind.  I procrastinate usually because I'm so mentally tired from thinking throughout the day.  I'm a math student, and those proofs are hairy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Help] Energy and Stress Management with Weight Loss </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Intro:  M, 27 years old, 5'7" CW: 163lbs, GW: 150

With I've already lost 4 lbs, but I noticed that I feel much more lethargic and stressful.  I haven't been exercising because I'm constantly thinking about school work for grad school.  I am within +/- 100 calories of my daily calculated rate, but sometimes I put in bad calories from junk food, mostly of out convenience and stress eating.

This my just be a hunch, but I notice my arms lost the most weight.  I'm very skinny to begin with, but I see how puny my wrists are, and my biceps lack definition.  Good thing is my stomach pooch is shrinking too, but I feel and look more frail as I notice my size shrinking.

I've been neglecting my mental state too.  I leave the house to school at 7 am, study until 1:30pm in the library.  I set aside 45 min for breakfast and lunch.  And I give myself a couple of 10 minute bathroom breaks.  Immediately when I come home from school, I am so exhausted from thinking that I take a 2-3 hour nap, just to have a break for my mind.  Then I spend 10pm to midnight watching internet shows.  On Fridays when I don't have class, I am so stressed from the entire week that I just spend the day doing nothing productive.  Mostly staying in bed.

I know I need to cut electronics before sleeping.  Should I exercise before sleeping?  Or before I head to school?  Have you guys had similar experiences?  What gave you the needed boost in energy and stamina? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hmm, I never thought of power lifting. I assume power lifting has do be done in specialized gyms?  I don't like commercial gyms like LA fitness.  The gym equipment is always occupied and it's too busy where I live.

I assume it's too dangerous to do at home by yourself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I should elaborate, would doing body weight exercises be enough?  Or some sort of prison workout?  Prisoners seem to look fit for just having their cells. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Help] Low Energy on a Calorie Restriction Diet </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-10 04:55:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently lost 4 lbs over the last twenty days over a calorie restriction diet.  I don't feel the hunger pangs that much.  In fact I don't feel that hungry at all anymore.  I'm noticing the difference within myself when it comes to muscle pain, hunger pain, and mental stress, which I used to associate with hunger.

I have a different problem now.  After long periods of studying, I feel the numbing fatigue and dull ache all over my body and I have low energy.  I don't feel hungry oddly enough.  And I don't exercise.  How do I get rid of the numbness?  Do I need to start exercising?  Or is this part of the calorie restriction? </TEXT>
