	<TEXT> Thanks a lot for the message man, like seriously messages like this from kind people like you mean the world to me.

I have phenibut actually but I won't touch it because it usually makes me much more depressed the day after.

I think I'm going to try to take a warm bath in epsom salts in just a bit and see if that helps.

I honestly don't know to what to use for my anhedonia now that I'm done with krarom but I guess I'll just have to keep looking, because kratom for me was never a long term solution </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just started withdrawal 2 days ago, some questions and need some help </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-19 00:45:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys I had been using kratom on and off several times a week since December and in the last month and a half had been using it almost every day of the week, and the last two weeks used it sometimes twice daily.

I had used it for my severe anhedonia and anxiety and it helps when I take it, but it only lasts so short (1 - 3 hours) each time I toss and swish so its not a long-term solution.

Some background: In the past I've tried 12 antidepressants, 8 stimulants, years of talk therapy, mediation, ketamine infusions, TMS therapy, lifestyle changes, diet and exercise, and I suspect along with my doctor that my brain has a dopamine dysfunction that does not have many real options for treatment as we don't know the exact issue with the dopamine. Stimulants help the most but my body has a crazy amount of nasty side effects from them and always a huge crash.  Recently I also got diagnosed for very low testosterone at the age of almost 24, and have been on testosterone replacement therapy now for 5 weeks and have felt better recently from that, but it doesn't touch my anhedonia one bit.

Anyway, I had my last bit of kratom almost 48 hours ago and I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms like really increased anhedonia and anxiety and am having a hard time coping.

Was just wondering if you guys could tell me if this heavy increase in depression/anxiety is normal for kratom withdrawal, and how long you suspect this increased depression/anxiety to last for me?  Would love to hear some stories of your experiences with kratom withdrawal too as I really do feel so alone right now.

Also was wondering if you guys had any suggestions regarding what I should try next for treatment for my severe anhedonia as for the last several months kratom was what I relied on to be able to enjoy things and hang out with people and have conversations and just experience joy in things.

Thanks for your help guys

	<DATE> 2017-04-17 01:36:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I took accutane about 4 years ago and it worked wonders for my acne but left me with bad stomach issues and I can no longer eat spicy foods or much dairy without landing in the bathroom for hours.

I have since had blood and stool tests along with a colonoscopy and endoscopy to help determine the exact cause of my stomach issues and the only thing that my GI saw was extreme sensitivity and he believes the accutane destroyed much of the good bacteria in my gut.

So I want to take probiotics and digestive enzymes to help repair my gut and stomach issues along with healing any other possible damage.

Do I take probiotcs and digestive enzymes at the same time? Or should I take one before the other? And either way how long do I take each of them? Is it indefinitely or like short courses of them like for a few months every couple years?

Thanks for your help guys </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just keep thinking man how fucked up my own mental health issues are, and how fucked up I think and sad I feel on a literal daily basis, and how if therapists I went to and friends I saw reinforced my ideas by telling me they were true how I would be completely lost and a literal goner.  

I sometimes think things like I'll never get out of my depression and that no one wants to talk to me, and if I had people that reinforced those ideas by telling me they were true then I would surely go insane and soon kill myself.  

Thankfully they aren't true and thankfully I have people to remind me that my irrational beliefs are wrong.  But I can't fathom how if a dude is sick enough to think he needs tits and a vagina that he won't get the same support I would get, and that the people he would trust the MOST to help him are helping sick people become more mentally unstable and permanently disfigured all for the sake of being politically correct and staying on the "right side" of history.

It actually pains me to my core how bad mental health professionals are failing at helping these obviously mentally ill individuals, and I think its insane how the mainstream media is labeling people like [Dr. Paul McHugh](http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/johns-hopkins-psychiatrist-transgender-mental-disorder-sex-change) as evil hateful bigots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe its just me being a dick, but I find lots of cartoon shows geared towards adults to best fit in with humor for middle schoolers.  Most people I know that watch Rick and Morty have a lower threshold for humor and think family guy and the simpsons are also hilarious.  

Once you hit around 22 you realize there's a ton more shows out there with better written humor and plotlines then a bunch of crappy cartoons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might be an unpopular opinion, but I found the dude getting dragged to be overreacting SIGNIFICANTLY by screaming like he was getting raped.

At the point when they said they were taking him off what did he think physically resisting was going to do? work? help his butt stay stuck to the seat? I'm not saying it was morally appropriate for the airline to do that, but he knew they were about to take him off by force and that resisting would just make it worse and not work at all.  

IMO, hearing him scream as if his child just died or he was getting raped was an insane overreaction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have severe depression and anxiety and have been pushing and working hard my whole life to not let it rule my life, and perhaps always will be struggling to keep going.

But I acknowledge how flawed and irrational many of my beliefs and fears are during much of my daily life, and I'm thankful that I have people to remind me how delusional I can be thinking, as to show me there's more to reality than what I currently see.

I think it's so fucked up how many therapists and psychiatrists are telling mentally ill people who want to cut off their dicks or breasts that they are fine and that what they are doing and thinking is healthy. I think it's insanely disgusting how mainstream culture is telling these sick unhealthy people that they are right in their beliefs and that they should in fact take hormones and destroy and mutilate their bodies. 

The fact is one cannot *feel* like a man or a woman. Being a man or a woman isn't defined by the clothes you wear or how long your hair is. Feeling like a man or a woman means feeling a penis or vagina between your thighs and feeling the XY or XX chromosomes in your body; and it is impossible to have the feeling of the opposite of either in ones body. It is impossible for me to know that I need XX chromosomes or a vagina on my body, because I have no way of understanding what that even means. The whole thing is just mental illness that should be and NEEDS to be treated as such. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know a lot of people might not like my answer, but Kratom is a great alternative for latent pain.  It is a plant thats ground up into tea powder and is amazing at crushing depression and anxiety for 1-5 hours each time depending on dose.

It's completely safe and legal but like any other substance if you take it too often you will develop a tolerance, and like alcohol or weed you will experience withdrawal after stopping long term use.  

However I can tell you kratom and r/kratom have not figuratively, but literally saved my life.  On my most suicidal nights I take some and it can completely shift my paradigm and mood within 30 minutes. </TEXT>

I hate Donald Trump and can see like any other rational human that he's a patholoical lying narccasist, but this is so obvious that I don't think hearing the same comedian say it ever night is so funny anymore.

Moreover, Meyers' voice is so fucking irritating, but well that's really besides the point I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude I feel you **100%**.

I'm almost 24 and have been depressed essentially my whole life, and significantly since I was 10.

I've tried 12 different antidepressants long term, I've tried 8 different ADD meds, I've tried ketamine infusions, TMS therapy, countless supplements, diet, exercise, meditation, and a million lifestyle changes.  Some of these changed my outlook and mindset significantly in positive ways, but have never consistently taken away my anhedonia and pain.

I've tried being in long term relationships, hanging with friends, and nothing ever helps.

Thank the lord though, I read several months back about how low testosterone can cause similar issues to depression, and I got checked and my levels came back super low on two separate occasions, and so I got on weekly injections four weeks ago, and since then I feel the best i've felt in ages.  I have more energy, confidence, less fatigue, less anxiety, slightly less depression, and a bit better sex drive so far, and it's still very early in my treatment, so it should improve even more.  

I still have severe anhedonia and may have to keep looking for an option to treat that, but please if you haven't get your testosterone levels checked and research yourself what low levels actually are, because the doctor will tell you you're fine even if your levels are very low.

Keep looking for a treatment man, there's fucking so many out there, it sucks feeling like shit all the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most people do not have the money to buy the same game three times.  Gaming subreddits can definitely create bubbles of hardcore gamers who forget that the majority of gamers do not match up with their lifestyle.  Most people spend probably 3% of their money or less on gaming, while hardcore gamers can spend 15-20% or even more.  

Spending $180 on the same game is not the lifestyle of a casual gamer, and this game is already half a decade old.  

It might sell well, it might not, but its hard to see casual gamers who have bought this game once on any myriad of systems buying this game again at a $60 price point, when they can pick it up for $10-$20 on any other platform. </TEXT>
