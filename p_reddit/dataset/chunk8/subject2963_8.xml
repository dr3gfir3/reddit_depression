	<TEXT> I'd say one reason for getting starting pitching now is Yanks are likely to lose Pineda and CC after this year. Tanaka could opt out. So Yanks could be looking for 3 starting pitchers in free agency. Might as well get a long term one now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Judge has looked like the real deal so far. So basically there are now two other outfield spots left for a whole bunch of prospects. There are Clint Frazier, Dustin Fowler, Blake Rutherford, Jake Cave and Billy McKinney to name a few. Not all can make it to the big league roster. Should Yankees try to trade a few of them for a starting pitcher? If so who? </TEXT>
