	<TEXT> Howdy all.

So I stupidly decided I was mostly done with Spidey books after *Superior* came to an end, and I'd really like to jump back on board before *Clone Conspiracy* kicks into high gear, so I'm wondering if someone could fill me in on what I missed, post *Spider-Verse*.

I'd really like t'know what's on shelves at the moment in terms of Spider-People, and where those books might've come from or spun out of, which'll make catching up a heckuva lot easier... I won't be offended by the odd spoiler, but keep it to a minimum if possible, right?

Cheers gang, looking forward to getting back into the swing of things. :-)  </TEXT>

Are there any limitations to this? I think it'd give Tizen a mild edge on Wear, actually, in terms of accessibility to the disabled, right? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help Choosing a Part-Time Course? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-27 21:42:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all!

I've been given the opportunity, through my employer, to undertake a course of study on a part-time basis. I'm considering a move into ICT, which my employer strongly backs, but I'm unsure of which course I should pursue. I'm hoping y'all could possibly provide me with some insight and/or advice.

I'm based in Dublin City Centre, which is unlikely to change in the near future, so access to a City Centre college would be an advantage, obviously. Examples I've come across include *[BSc Information Systems and Information Technology](http://dit.ie/computing/parttime/bscinformationsystemsandinformationtechnology/)* in D.I.T., *[BSc in Information Systems](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/undergraduate/information-systems/)* in Trinity College Dublin,
*[BSc (Hons) Computing](http://goo.gl/leYT8A)* in D.B.S., and *[BSc (Honours) in Computing](https://goo.gl/o2yHGt)* in N.C.I. I should voice my concerns, however, that none of these courses are specifically termed "Computer Science." Should this worry me?

Further to that, I'd be interested in keeping my options open for the future, following on from the course's (hopeful!) completion; for instance, I don't want to waste time and money being taught how best to tell someone to switch their router off then on again - moving into academia could strongly interest me in the future.

I'm open to all suggestions right now, and anybody who wishes to share any personal but sensitive information is welcome to send me a PM, I'll be happy to offer more details on my own circumstances.

Huge thanks in advance t'this community, I'm hopeful that I can become a much more active contributor should I take up a relevant course.

An additional note I might mention is that I do already possess an undergraduate degree, granted not of the highest order, but I felt it may make a difference. Cheers! </TEXT>

I'd t'do this previously, for CM 12.1, which was fine, but at this point I'm just getting a straight up failure, no details whatsoever.

A thought I've had is that I'm attempting to Clean Flash. Would Dirty be a better idea? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're seeing more and more smartwatches in public, and although they may be more commonplace, and hence more readily accepted, I'm still not sure I'd want any attention that a smartwatch might warrant, especially in the workplace.

I'm interested in hearing about how both device setup and use can contribute to discretion when wearing/using a smartwatch. What, if anything, have you guys found works? What doesn't? Most importantly, what hilarious stories can you share?

Huge thanks in advance folks, this could be interesting! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-05-27 22:02:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm hoping to squeeze a few more months, at least, out of this device, and a custom ROM is the way I'd like t'go, specifically the one in the title - at least until the official build comes 'round.

Anyway, I'm having monumental difficulty flashing these builds, and I'm hoping someone could offer me their advice. I'm currently using an unofficial build of CM 12.1, in conjunction with TWRP 2.8.7.0, if that helps. I've removed the relevant line of code from updater-script, and now the error that I'm seeing is even more vague.

I'm not entirely sure I'm in a position to shell out for a new device just (and believe me, I've been tempted!), so any advice at all would be helpful.

Many thanks in advance. </TEXT>
