	<TEXT> (XB1) I just got done with a 5 hour gaming session by myself because none of my friend were on Siege. I said fuck it, I'm gonna talk by myself just to make callouts- and it works a lot of the time. It seems that 90% of people without mics actually hear you, and when you make a clear callout it helps to keep them alive. I won 4 games in a row with a group of randys and we did pretty well! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-01-15 23:37:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Does anyone else believe that gaming has gotten too pricey? We always hear of annoyances about how current gen games are 60 bucks and from what I've heard, even more in countries outside the U.S., but I sort of miss the days where I bought a console and my games and didn't have to worry about anything else. Sure, there was the occasional accessory, memory card or controller, but for the most part, it was reasonably affordable. Now we have all these online passes restricting us from buying the pre-owned version of games and barricading us from recieving our full gaming experience, DLC, online memberships, game exclusive memberships such as COD Elite, etc. It's very annoying. Plus, anyone who cannot access the internet is practically screwed over with almost every title released these days. Another annoyance is how publishers are completely disregarding future generations. Much of the content in many titles will not be available for them. I highly doubt young gamers are going to be able to access the Ceberus network for Mass Effect 2 or download maps for multiplayer titles in the year 2042. Are they devs hoping their games will lose all relevance by then? Heck, the Magnavox Oddyssey will still be sought after and it will be over 65 years old by then! </TEXT>
