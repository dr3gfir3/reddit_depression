	<TEXT> For a project I'm working on we need to parse svn XML data into php data structures so we can display it on a website.  All of my data structures correctly load into memory.  With the way svn_list.xml stores data, separates each file based on its path. What I'm trying to do is parse this data into a new class ProjectElement, which will contain the project name and all of the files for the project.  The issue is that my project class is not behaving anywhere near expected.  If I create a new ProjectElement and pass in a name to the constructor, if I call the getName method it returns null.  However, if I print out the variable I passed in as a argument to the object creation, it prints correctly.  Code will be provided below: 

ProjectElement Class: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0f097a1ba1a9c96ae612

ListElement Class (Holds info about the parsed XML data):
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/359c68e3d3070da359c4

Function in question:

	<TEXT> I'm looking for a set of beginner monitors for basic mixing/playback.  One limitation is that my audio interface is currently the Avid Eleven Rack which in terms of stereo output only has XLR outs.  Right now I'm looking at used M-Audio BX5's and BX8's, due to the fact that I'm a college student and I'm on a somewhat tight budget.  Are these good choices or are there other options I should be considering? I mainly play/produce metal/prog stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done pretty well on all my other interview questions, for this one I'm just having a hard time coming up with the approach/algorithm to take. I can come up with something that works ok for n=3 or 4, but once I try n10 it just fails miserably. 

EDIT: The approach I tried the last time I did it was to make a giant array list and expand upon it every iteration by combining each previous substring with another single character, but I kept getting unwanted results in the answer and I couldn't figure out how to remove those.  I also think I got a bit anxious when seeing the problem again after having no idea what to do the first time I saw the problem.  </TEXT>

I have no idea how to approach this problem.  I've considered using both iterative and recursive approaches, but have gotten nothing so far.  Any suggestions on how to code this would be appreciated.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now I have a surface pro 3 at school, and I'm a computer science major, and I'm looking to get a linux VM up and running. I would just go with Ubuntu, but my machine only has 256gb storage on the SSD so I really don't want to eat up GB's of space if I don't have to.  What I'll pretty much need is a basic web browser (ad-block capable), a package manager and a good UI.  I really like the UI Ubuntu has, if they had a lightweight version of linux with a similar UI design that would be cool.  I have some experience doing basic navigation and software development stuff from the terminal so I am somewhat familiar with linux, but I'd prefer to not build my own distro from scratch.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm at UIUC. I would want to wait for the SP4,  but my last laptop (late 2009 white MacBook) died at the end of last semester. So I need to get something now for my one project based class or I'll basically fail, since the rooms you have discussion sections in only have a tv you hook up to and no pcs, according to my friends who took the class last semester. Another things I forgot to mention in my post was another main reason which I'm going for the surface, which is that I'm taking a graph theory and an algorithms class which uses lots of graph theory, so I figured the pen would be really useful for taking notes/annotating PDFs in those classes.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Considering buying a SP3, looking for input/suggestions </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-14 00:59:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a college student studying computer science and I'm getting a new machine for this year.  I have it narrowed down to a SP3 or a macbook pro.  My top choice right now is the surface, but I have concerns that might make me want to go with the macbook, so I wanted to ask you guys about these potential issues. Right now I'm considering the i5/256gb model with 8gb ram. 

Firstly, how well does it handle VMs? One of my classes next year has a fair amount of web development and looking at the class materials from last year it seems like it will be loads easier to do the stuff in linux.  I have external drives so storage isn't a concern, I'm more interested in how well the VM's themselves will run. Secondly, how well does it handle large IDE's such as visual studio, eclipse or Intellij IDEA? Another one of my classes is a project based class with a focus on learning to use all the features of IDE's using things like refactoring. I have no doubt it will be able to run simpler editors with ease, but I wasn't sure if all of the behind the scenes stuff in the IDE's would be too much for the surface.  Is it manageable to do stuff that can normally be done in the terminal in OSX? I'm concerned things that can be done with a package manager on OSX might be extremely difficult to perform on a surface.  Lastly, I do a bit of song recording/music production and will need to run pro tools 12.  Will the SP3 be powerful enough to handle it? And to music people that are using the ASIO4ALL driver (not necessarily limited to PT12), how has it worked on your surface? 

One last question, due to my budget the surface pro i5 comes in under what I have budgeted.  One option I've been considering as well is simply getting a surface 3 to do my mobile work and then building a desktop to handle all the heavy lifting.  All of the concerns listed about would still apply, but I'm not sure 4gb ram and 128gm ssd would be enough considering the programs I have to run, and also the fact that it has the gimped SSD on it would result in lesser performance. The reason I'm concerned about running an IDE on it is the class I talked about above that uses the advanced features of IDE's is a project based class, and you have to take your laptop to discussion sections and hook it up to the projector to go over stuff with your group, so it would need to be able to fully run those IDEs and compile large projects. I'd most likely use the desktop for programming the majority of stuff and the surface for casual use in this case, but then I'd also have to deal with switching files between machines for my project based classes. Another one of my classes is a senior project class, and I'm concerned that the surface 3 wouldn't be powerful enough.  I looked at both the SP3 and S3 at best buy a couple days ago and preferred the size of the S3 for tablet use, but I'm not sure it would have the performance for my needs.  Also if I went with the SP3, would it be able to play CSGO well enough to play competitive on it? Any input you guys have would be appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm basically (no pun intended) interested in learning some new musical ideas and techniques, as my band has agreed that we should all be practicing 45-60 minutes minimum a day, so I figured it would be a good idea to create a place for the community to discuss different things that they use to learn new skills. I'm mainly interested in stuff that would be useful for prog and metal, but feel free to share resources for any styles. 

To start things off, here's a few resources I love.

[TalkingBass-Link to Youtube Channel:](https://www.youtube.com/user/TalkingBassVideo/playlists) Website with in depth YouTube tutorials. There is content there to span all levels of bass playing over a huge range of topics, from setting strap height to different types of harmonics to chord construction. The thing that makes him great is that he doesn't assume you know anything, and outlines everything you need to do in a clear and concise manner.  I found this most helpful in his tapping videos, as I'd been trying to learn the technique for some time and couldn't quite get it, but after watching his videos on tapping I've made substantial progress. I highly recommend checking out his music theory for bassists playlist. 

[Alex Webster's Extreme Metal Bass Book:](http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Metal-Bass-Book-CD/dp/1423497155) What I love about this book is it gives some great exercises to get into finger-style metal, with stuff for two fingers, galloping, and three fingers. 

[Daves Guitar and Bass Resources Page:](http://www.davegrossman.net/guitar-and-bass/index.html)  While mainly for five and six string basses, this is basically a scale/arpeggio/chord archive.  It contains a massive amount of information about a wide variety of scales (should be more than 99% of bassists will ever need) and things about basic triad through extended range chordal construction.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now in my game as Whales I've taken over all of the counties not belonging to England, and I've been looking to expand into Ireland or Scotland.  However, my Chancellor (Skill 19) has been fabricating a claim on the same county for 20 years with no success.  I know crusader kings is vastly different than EU4, where a claim has a guaranteed time of one year.  I was wondering if there are any mods that make the fabricate claim time a set amount of time as in EU4, or possibly put a cap on it (say a claim has a 15% chance of occurring, if 5 years pass with no success then you automatically get the claim).  The game is extremely boring as of now since England has 2x my military strength, so its basically wait to see if a claim ever goes through or hope that one of my marriages with England finally pays off, which will take quite some time.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As a new player to competitive, this game seems very poor at integrating new players into the game.  Firstly, it seems like no one cares if they leave at low levels. Within the last four games, my team has two leavers by round five for two of the games, and in the other two my team has had two leavers by round 12, while the other team has had none.  With the bots derping around and doing bot stuff, it's near impossible to win from this point on. Secondly, the teams are incredibly unbalanced.  For the last two games I've played, every single player on my team has been negative while every single player on the enemy team has been positive (Can provide screenshots for proof).  I don't know what attempts are made at balancing with regards to player skill and parties but it seems to be doing a poor job. To quote the wiki, "Don't worry about your skill. The only way to become good at something is to have practice at it and the same applies here."  But its extremely hard to become better when your team is plagued with leavers and people who don't use mics.  If anyone has tips on how to make the grind through low ranks not so soul crushing I'd appreciate the advice.  In terms of my skill level, my KDR is usually around .8-1.5 and I think I do a pretty solid job with callouts.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking for feedback on my general Eastern Block deck, which is primarily used for 10v10 matches: http://i.imgur.com/YNIVc5G.png

Logistics: Wheeled CV for availability with only 1 CV card, FOB to feed my Ondava's and resupply vehicles, and a card of helos and trucks is pretty self explanatory.

Infantry:  This is the area of the deck that I think needs the most work. I really like the LSTR-40's, I like using units like them or the SAS in my opener. The other unit I love is the polish shock saperzy, they are absolute beasts in city and forest fighting against other infantry. I'm having trouble deciding on the last three spots.  First point of contention is whether to bring to GROM or not.  For smaller matches (4v4, 3v3), I think the GROM would be very beneficial to have is it would allow for an inexpensive way to expand the AA net.  In 10v10's though, I find myself rarely calling them in because players are so closely grouped together and their heavy AA units take care of most problems.  My second problem is I'm not sure how I should be distributing my remaining shock/line infantry.  I picked the Mot Schutzen/Niebieskie because I thought they would be somewhat complementary, but I feel like this could be greatly improved.  Suggestions for this section would be greatly appreciated. 

Support: Ondava for heavy arty, PRAM for morters, very happy with them. STROP 2 for non-rader with solid damage/air detection, East German Tunguska for helos and Newa for planes.  I haven't had any real problems with this thus far.

Tanks: Moderna/Twardy for the top end, T72 MIM to deal with the midrange tanks, and T72M's for spam/fire support/fodder.

Recon: Helo self explanatory, Formoza for god-mode anti-infantry.  I really like using shock recon infantry and find they complement my playstyle well, so I take a card of the EG ones. I close it out with the Czech exceptional optics vehicle.  

Vehicles: I am in love with the PRAM, its a fantastic unit .  Its cannon is useful for killing/suppressing infantry, and its missiles are great at halting/slowing down approaching apcs/light tanks.  I took the Konkurs-M as I dont have a way of dealing with heavy armor and I thought the 23AP would be nice, but these could possibly be swapped out.

Helos: DHS Mi24-P has great IR plus the best ATGM missiles of the east block helos.  I only take one card of helos as I find I don't use them that often, and the EB doesn't have must take options like the Akula or Apache or Longbow. 

Planes: Mig 29 for air to air, Mig 25RBF for bombing runs,  Sierra 30 for anti armor and su22-mp for sead.  I thinks its a decent plane setup. 

Overall I really love playing the deck, but I feel the infantry selection needs to be improved to really make this a killer deck.  </TEXT>

The issue I'm trying to solve is when my band does live cover gigs we use two tunings, E standard and Bb standard.  I have two basses so the tuning isn't an issue, but the two basses have significantly different output levels/eq curves, even when the onboard preamps are set flat.  I'm just looking for a cheap pedal that I can use to balance the input gain between the two instruments for as little money as possible, as I'm very happy with my current sansamp/bass amp for my sound.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So if you dime the gain knob on it do you get a full out distortion? On mine if you crank the drive (not gain, could be a difference in amp structure) all it does is add some upper harmonics to the sound which gives it a wonderful solo clean tone, but it sort of gets lost in the mix.  Other then the non-existent drive I love my amp, but this is why I need to rely on pedals/effects/possible dual amp for the dirt sound.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The main reason I'm considering getting into a dual amp setup is that so far I've been unable to discover a distortion pedal or pedal combo that really gives me a great dirt tone while maintaining a big low end presence.  The issues I've run into is that I've liked the grit of guitar pedals better, but they eat up the low end like no other.  I've had a bit of success using the boss bass overdrive 3 in front of a sansamp, which sounds great though my map, the issue is that when we take the DI to record in sounds like shit in the recording.  I'm guessing its due to the cabinet I have shaping the sound slightly, as well as the fact the amp will have an inherent EQ curve even when set flat. The goal with a dual amp route (It could even be two bass amps with one having dirt pedals in front and the other clean, I'm not set on a guitar amp) is that it would allow a wider range of flexibility for dirt tones, as mixing and matching different overdrive, distortion and fuzz pedals would not affect the base bottom end tone at all.  I have a flanger and delay I could use for the clean channel right now, but the problem is I have no way to switch off two dirt boxes and kick both of those on live in a reasonable amount of time.  Another possible solution would be to use the boss LS-2 (dual effect loop pedal) and run one effect loop as dirt pedals and one loop as clean effects into an effects head while having a second head for the underlying bass tone.  The wet head would not have any dirt on it by default to allow for vibrent clean tones, but the advantage of this is its a one pedal press to swap between the two versus four as of now, which could grow even further with more pedals.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The reason you're against octave down is exactly why you shouldn't try and substitute your bass with an 8-string guitar. Your preference for octave-ing up is a reason to stick to your bass guitar." 

This sums everything up perfectly.  The original reason I wanted the 8 string is it would give a wide array of variety, as I (thought) it would allow for low end stuff on the bottom strings, but w/o overdrive the mid/high strings could be used for chords/melodic accompaniment.  My main concern with the traditional bass is obtaining a wide array of tonal options, which I'm finding limited as of now.  Possible solutions would be a traditional 6 string bass w/ narrower string spacing, investigating a wider array of effects, or finding someway to vastly expand my pallet with my current instrument (no idea of how to do that).  It seems like the bass VI would be a good compromise, but I still feel the bottom string is too narrow.  If it was 31-31.5in scale length and had a low E with a .95-1 stringsize (possibly fanned fret) I'd jump on it right away, but right now I feel the bass VI will give up too much low end.  Again this is all my interpretation as I haven't had a chance to try any in person yet. 

I think I was thrown off before and I was focusing too much on the platform itself instead of saying "My problem is we need more midrange" and trying to craft a solution to meet that goal.  </TEXT>

I've tried out the regular big muff and one more that I can't remember at a local shop, but they both gave off a classic rock/arctic monkeys type vibe, and I found they wouldn't be ideal for prog stuff.  If I was doing something like doom they might have been a better fit.  Obviously there are tons of fuzz pedals out there, so perhaps there's some that would be good for metal  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason I'd be ok with the octave up is that the wet signal would only be used for the dirt channel, so the synthy part won't matter as much as its pretty much gonna disappear once the gain structure hits it. The reason I'm against octave down is that I've talked to drummers before who's bands didnt have bassists so they used guitars w/ octave down pedals, and they said the first time they played with a real bass after that was a heavenly experience.  It might not be as big a deal for bass since the strings will be thinker, but I would be playing the same fundamental as the guitars were and I'm concerned the low end would be lost.  

The main reason that I would want the 8 string over a traditional bass is the string spacing. Right now I have pretty solid fast picking skills as well as decent finger speed, but the problem is that with the thicker bass strings combined with the fact that there are large gaps between the strings makes it difficult to play fast single note runs.  For example, I've learned Laid to Rest on guitar (I've played guitar for a couple years) and I can knock it out no problem, but on  bass my my left hand cannot keep up currently on the opening riff , especially on the last 12 notes of the riff (The bass part mirrors the guitar part).  I've noticed its more of a problem when playing with a pick as well, but trying to play something like Laid to Rest with fingerstyle just wouldn't yield the right tone.  I'm at like 95% of the original song speed with fingerstyle but only 65-70% with a pick.  While the part from Laid to Rest might not be the most difficult thing to get down in the end, our guitarist likes writing a lot of really fast lines to that of a similar style and I'm concerned I won't be able to keep up. Maybe its just a matter of technique, but I'm already working though Alex Websters metal bass book and working on technique regularly, and I don't see much progress on this topic area as compared to other ones.  I know John Myung uses a 5 string neck on his 6 string bass because he plays such complex runs, but as a college student I really don't have the cash to go out and have a custom instrument made.  The bass vi might be a solid remedy to this, but my two concerns with the vi are firstly that it only has single coil pickups (Thats an on paper flaw, I'd have to try out in person to see) and secondly that it's such short scale.  The benefit of course is that it has string spacing more towards what I'd like, but it also uses much smaller strings.  

EDIT: I should also mention that I already have a 50w hybrid guitar amp (2x12, solidstate pre/tube power) and a small selection of dirt/effect pedals, so going to a bi-amp setup would be as simple as buying something like the boss LS-2 pedal.  I could also use the parallel out on the sans amp I have to send a signal to the dirty amp, but I wouldn't have a way to mute the channel as of now. My main point of contention is I'm not sure what the best instrument for the approach would be.

	<TEXT> Would it be possible to compensate for the lack of low end on an 8 string (possibly the bass vi too) by eq and balancing between the two amps?

	<TEXT> Ok cool, thanks for the response.  In looking at 8 strings vs bass VI's, one thing I've noticed is that the scale length on most 8 strings is far from ideal, with most hovering around 27 inches.  Seeing as I would want the low string to be the same as the low bass string, and considering my band might switch to D standard, I'm concerned that an 8 string would not provide nearly enough tension, especially as my main ax right now has a 35 inch scale for a 4 string bass tuned to standard.  Bass VI's are usually 30ish which isn't great but its not horrible.  It'd be really cool if they had a fanned fret model out there with like a 30 inch scale for the e and it shifts to like 27 for the high strings, but that might be too much of a shift in length.  I really like the idea of having the higher strings available on an 8 string to go melodic when necessary but that short scale length might be a deal breaker.  I won't be able to try either the 8 string or bass VI out until I get home from school in a couple weeks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I were to use something such as an Axe FX or something else that could run dual amps like a POD 500x, would there still be issues with being out of phase? I know I'd be able to mix the levels on the device but I'm not familiar with how phase works on amp simulators. The main reason I'm considering the Bass VI or 8 string over a regular bass is that with the shortened scale length and narrower string spacing, it would make it easier to play more complex/extremely fast riffs.   I know that if you drop tune the 8 string the low E would be the same as the bass low E.  Would there be any discernible difference in studio recordings due to differences in string tension/diameter, or is that basically insignificant? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I play bass in a 4 piece prog metal band, which is currently set up me on bass, one guitarist, a drummer, and a vocalist. An issue that we're running into right now is filling the whole sonic spectrum.  If I'm holding down the bassline and the guitarist is playing higher on the neck, we have a huge gap in the midrange.  Would it be a good idea or completely outrageous to get either a Squier Bass VI or a 8 string guitar? I was thinking of doing a two amp setup, where I'd split the signal and run one side to a regular style bass rig, most likely with a SVT type tone from a sansamp, and then run the second signal into a guitar amp for any dirt/distortion.  I'd use a graphic EQ to cut anything under 100-130hz on the dirt head (depends on how the rig reacts if I end up getting it) so that there would be a solid low end at all times, and then I could do everything from light distortion/fuzz to full blown djent tones on the dirty head.  We also do a few clean breakdowns in the middle of songs, so I could then cut the dirt entirely and move higher up on the neck to provide a more melodic backdrop when necessary.  I guess the closest band I can think of to what I'd want is something Animals as Leaders-esq, but with more of an emphasis on the low end for my part, as I'd be thinking and writing from a bass perspective instead of a guitar perspective.  Do you guys think this is a feasible idea or am I just crazy? 

EDIT: I didn't think to post this earlier for some reason, but here's my current gear.  Main ax is a Ibanez BTB400, and my secondary is an Ibanez SR305.  My bass amp is a Carvin BX500 2x10 combo, and for bass pedals I have a tuner, sansamp and boss bass overdrive.  For my guitar amp I have a Peavey classics 2x12 50w hybrid amp (SS pre/tube power), along with some overdrive pedals, flanger and delay.  I know the amp isn't the best for metal, but if it ends up sounding decent to good on this amp it will sound great on a dedicated high gain head.  Right now I'm mainly concerned with what could possibly be viable, as I'm currently at school.  When I get home I'm planning on spending a long time at guitar center and sitting down and testing these ideas out experimentally.  There's a very good chance I could go there and within 10 minutes realize there is no way in hell I could replace my bass with an 8 string, so this post is moreso the theroycrafting/input side, as well as getting feedback from people who have tried similar things. </TEXT>

The only downside is that there 1920x1080 displays are matte, but if you go up to 4k you can get a glossy finish one.  For $1474, with a matte IPS display you can get it with 16gb RAM, add a 120gb M2 SSD, 1TB hdd and upgrade to killer LAN.  You could also drop it to 8gb RAM and upgrade the screen to a 4k glossy display, which would come out at around $1514, keeping the same drives and killer LAN.  Both models are w/ the 970.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: Preferably under $1300, overall under $1400

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Medium Gaming, Programming, virtual machine usage (All my CS classes use linux, plus I'm talking cybersecurity classes next semester so I'll probably need to run a few VM's at a time for that class), some audio production with reaper

* Screen size preference: 15"-17"

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows for the base OS, I'll be running linux on the VMs

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Wargame Red Dragon, similar strategy games, city skylines, BF4/Battlefront 3 (When Released).  60fps on high/ultra preferred, but I realize I may have to scale back to high/medium for some newer games based on my budget

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): Audio production, VM usage

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): None

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I'd prefer a not too over the top gaming appearance, Something that might be too much would be those massive desktop replacement laptops for dedicated gaming.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, two, or balanced)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: Low weight and high performance

* Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance: Build Quality and High performence

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Balanced

**Which features would you pay a premium for?**

* High resolution screen: 1980x1020 is fine, I don't need a 4k display

* A great keyboard: Yes

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Yes!!!!! I find most windows trackpads suck compared to apple ones, so a nice trackpad is a huge plus

* Great audio: If it has a good soundcard, then yes.  I don't need to pay extra just for some branded speakers as I'll be using monitor headphones

**List any features that are critical: **

So far three laptops have caught my eye, and I'm looking for help on deciding which one to get.  They are the Gigabyte P35w v2, Asus ROG gl551jw-ds74, and the MSI GS70-037, links below.  The reason I'm going with the GS70 over the GS60 is that for $10 more, you lose 250gb on the hard drive and gain 2 inches of display, plus you get a lot more ports on the sides which I like.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834233086

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=34-232-405

http://www.amazon.com/MSI-GS70-STEALTH-037-17-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B00JKCHRXC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1428362745 sr=8-1 keywords=msi+gs70

Right now I'm leaning towards the Gibabyte, for a few reasons.  Number one is the fact that it has that removable dvd drive into a hard drive caddy.  When my old laptop died (motherboard failed), I had just bought a new hard for it a couple weeks beforehand.  I figured I can put this drive (500gb 5400rpm drive) in the drive caddy and use it as a dedicated virtual machine drive, while saving the 1TB drive in the machine for all my regular data, with the 128gb system drive being reserved for the OS and maybe a game.  It also has the best graphics card out of all the machines I've listed benchmark wise.  The Asus seems to be a middle ground the two other machines with graphics in between the other two, more RAM then the MSI, and it has better external build quality than the gigabyte.  The Asus also comes with a free gaming mouse, a slight benefit. The MSI wins out in terms of the best keyboard, best build quality and really slim design, but it also has the worst graphics by a longshot, less RAM and less storage.  The RAM and storage wouldn't be such a big deal if it wasn't such a pain in the ass to install msata drives or replace RAM on it, as you have to disassemble the whole machine and take out the motherboard to do so.  

I'm interested in any feedback you guys have, and perhaps you will see something I missed and will be able to provide some insight into which would be a better choice. </TEXT>

"This copy of the Install OS X Yosemite application can't be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading."

Some googling on my part has revealed that most of the problems in this regard have to do with the date, however, I have my date and time set to automatically sync with apples servers in system preferences, and typing date in terminal gives the proper date and time.  I've tried downloading the installer three times now, and its failed every time, and I find it odd that if it was indeed file corruption on the installer it would happen three times in a row.  It seems all the advice around this issue is based around the date not being correct.  If anyone has any ideas of how to fix this I would appreciate your help.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now I've got a Carvin BX500 combo 210 version plus a sansamp pedal, so I'm pretty happy with my setup for now. My dream rig is an ampeg SVT CL with an ampeg 810, but I won't be able to afford that until I'm done with college as that'll run above 2 grand. When looking at the MIM basses versus the higher end squiers, are there particular things I should be looking at when comparing quality? I bought my first bass from a friend so I've never really shopped for basses in a store before so I'm not sure what to look for in basses besides just picking it up and playing it  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm honestly not sure if I want to go J bass or P bass at this point, the reason being my band only has one guitarist.  If we had two guitarists I'd take the P bass easily, but because my guitarist likes to play around higher up in the guitar range (not solos, just main playing wise), it leaves a lot more room on the bottom open for the bass to fill, so I think that having a J bass might allow me to do more stuff with creating a unique sounding bass sound to go with the one guitarist setup.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best mid-range cost passive basses? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-30 05:51:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Right now I have an Ibanez SR305, and through my testing of other mid-cost basses (On my last trip to guitar center), it seems like basses in this range have extremely questionable preamps.  On my bass the only difference when switching between pickups is there's about a 10% volume boost when 100% on the bridge pickup, the bass knob just muddies up the low end when the low end is boosted, and the treble knob basically acts like a presence knob.  I was messing around at guitar center the other day and was shocked when I picked up a jazz bass, as switching between different pickup configurations and different tone knob settings actually made very notable and distinct changes to the sound.  I'm interested in spending $300 to $450 on a bass, used is ok, but the only passive basses my guitar center had were the squiers and fenders, so I just wanted to check with you guys and see if you had any suggestions on passive basses in that price range.  Right now this is probably my number one choice: http://www.guitarcenter.com/Squier-Vintage-Modified-Jazz-Bass-V-5-String-Electric-Bass-109437368-i3271155.gc

EDIT: The main genres I play are hard rock, punkish stuff, metal and progressive metal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DO NOT START WITH THE USA. Start with a nation that has actual serviceable infantry. When I started out I began as the U.S., and my infantry would constantly get their asses handed to them, and this was before I really got into analyzing stats for Deckbuilding, so I basically avoided infantry for the longest time. I would maybe take 3 cards in my US deck, and I would usually be playing defense defense, because having bad infantry makes it hard to assault towns.  Once I branched out and started playing eurocorps, commonwealth and USSR, I realized infantry were actually extremely potent and opened up a lot of new strategies. So I recommend starting with one of the groups listed above, especially considering the infantry nerfs towards the U.S. in the last patch  </TEXT>

What if we wanted to prove the inf is zero.  We know 1/n always greater then 0, so bdd below. If zero not inf, then there is an m st m(1/n) for all n. What would we do to show a contradiction here?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm having trouble trying to prove that the supremum of {1/n | n is a natural number} is equal to 1.  The set is bdd above by 1, so we know the supremum exists.  To show that there is no lesser upper bd, we need to show that there are no m  1 st m  (1/n) for all n.  So we want to use contradiction, and assume that there is a lesser upper bd, which means that m(1/n) for all n is true. This is where I'm stuck, as I don't know how to rearrange this to obtain a contradiction.  Would it be legal to say "Take n to be 1/m.  Then 1/(1/m) = m, so we have m  m, which is a contradiction." I don't think this is right, but I don't see any other way to manipulate it.  The part thats throwing me of is N has to be a natural number, and I don't see how to work around that when m can be less than 1.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 5 bonus activation points is why I like single nations  </TEXT>

	<TITLE>   </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I would definitely recommend playing as a coalition or a single nation, the +5 or +10 activation points totally makes it worth it; with only 50 to play with you're going to have to take unnecessary compromises in some areas.  A good coalition to play would be euro-corps, good single nations would be US or USSR. I would also recommend looking up each nations strengths and weaknesses to see which ones fit more with your playstyle, for example the French have lightly armored but fast tanks, while UK tanks are slower but have much more armor.  Finding which nation/coaltion has the units that favor your playstyle is important, but its not something that will come instantly, its something to develop over time.  

Here's some general advice based on your current deck for ones you build in the future (I don't play 1v1's as much so I'm not going to comment on logistics/CV selection, as I namely play 4v4s so I CMV card is usually enough for me, but this might not be the case for 1v1s.)

Infantry: You normally want to have all five slots filled with infantry.  I usually like to take 1AGTM (Anti-Tank) card and 1AA(Infrared Infantry).  I usually grab the midtier ATGM and best AA, and don't upvet them, because numbers will be greater then the added accuracy bonus in this case.  I would also grab one card of line infantry in a cheaper transport and shock infantry in an IFV.  For the last card I usually take a commando unit (Spetz, SAS, etc, I personally try to avoid delta force, I find them disappointing) or maybe some flame infantry for forest/city fighting.  

Tanks: You have a pretty good selection.  I personally usually grab three/four cards over 100 pts, then grab one card around 70-80 for the last one.  I personally find the cheaper tanks rather bland, the only exception being the T72A for USSR for 55pts which is amazing.  Just make sure to grab whatever your nations superheavy is, as they can be gamechangers (LeCleric, Challenger 2, etc).  

Support: A pretty solid start.  I prefer bombardment arty (US Paladin, UK As-90) over the snipers, but its a matter of personal preference. Keep in mind if you select a coalition/single nation you'll get access to their prototype arty, which is usually extremely good.  I personally like to take 1 card of arty.  For AA your on the right track, only thing I would do is sub out one of the radar SAMS for an infrared launcher like the US Chaparral or French Croatle, just to have some good anti helo options.  Otherwise it looks really good.  You may want to consider dropping a SPAAG to pickup a mortar or a MLRS just to mess around with and see if you like them.  

Recon: Good for activation points you have.  If you rebuild with a coalition or a single nation, I would recommend picking up another recon card. Another card of infantry or a heavier vehicle to accompany pushes would be a good choice.  

Vehicle: Good for the deck you have.  If you end up picking the US or UK, consider getting the CEV type vehicle, they can utterly destroy infantry. If you end up building w/ a coalition/single nation, flamethrowers or fire support vehicles like the COMVAT are some other slid choices. 

Helos: Solid.  Maybe drop 1 card (not apache), but overall it seems good.  Maybe consider an AA chopper too.  

Planes: Solid.  You have air superiority, tank killer and bomber, which is good.  As NSWP said below, swap the thunderbolt out for the F18, its a much better value.  I personally like the F16 AFFs over the F15, simply because you get 2 instead of 1.  You're kinda fucked if you only have a single ASF and you lose it.  F15-D is a good bomber, solid choice.  If you decide to go coalition/single nation, make sure to pick up a sead plane.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For your new deck, I'd downvet the ATGM and AA infantry. Only having 4 of each is no nearly enough, and they have pretty good base accuracy. Having 7 of each will be much better then only having 4 of each with slightly more accuracy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your euro deck is almost the same as the one I use in 10v10s. Some thoughts: 

Downvet the panzergrenadiers in the non marder 2. I find having more of them is helpful in longer games. I personally bring a commando squad instead of the flame infantry, but those work just as well, mainly comes down to play style.  I'm also a big fan of manpads, so I sometimes bring minstrels instead of line infantry. I find that having two cards of panzergrenadiers is better then just one and then a card of line infantry and I really love my manpads, so jagers usually sit out for me, but again this is mainly a play style choice. 

Only other thing I would change is swap out the rafale for a ASF card that gives two planes. Numbers are extremely important for 10v10, and if you lose that single rafale it will really hurt

	<TEXT> Do you think the stormers are worth it? I've only tried them a couple times, and was generally unimpressed.  Maybe my positioning was poor or something, but it seemed like the marksman were always the ones killing enemy helos.  Do you think its worth taking only higher end tanks?  The reason I took the chieftains is I wanted something similar to the 55pt T72's the USSR gets.  

I also noticed I was never using the rardens in the vehicle and I never called in more then 3 strikers, so I ended up dropping the rardens and one card of the strikers.  I'm back at school right now so I can't post an updated deck list, but I basically dropped those two as well as one of the cheaper helo cards.  The debate I'm having is whether to bring in the GR7s or to bring in a card of the 155pt challengers and a card of either the challenger marksman or the stormer, since you mentioned it would be worth having.  I'm considering the stormers because I've been seeing a lot of sead lately so I've been having to micro my radar AA, so it would be nice to have a non-radar AA with good anti-helo range.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's my general UK deck: http://i.imgur.com/0BMcCIJ.jpg

Deck code: DvAclo6xy51m6E8HKR9WVus8onp5Rp5OoY0ZsIXkZDpRCBDuReIwEXUKyHIzucKGDC7VPinxDkh4I5kZheJm4ViLJGqi6Rqg

It seems to be working pretty well so far.  I've only got a few problem areas in the deck for me.  The one thing I'm really still ironing out is the recon tab.  I'm just trying different combos of vehicles and infantry to figure out what works best.  I usually only take recon with very good or higher optics, so mainly its been debating between a second card of SBS or the spartans. The only other thing I'm really having trouble with is the 4th air slot.  It seems like the Jag GR.1A's have shit for accuracy and always miss, but the harrier GR1 has such a limited role with its paveways that I haven't really found much use for it.   Overall I'm pretty happy with the rest of the deck so far, and I'm interested to hear your thoughts on the deck. </TEXT>

I got mine used from Guitar Center and it was in like-new condition for $300. Between the parametric EQ and graphical EQ, you can basically get any tone you want. The fact that it has a DI level adjustment means its very usable if you need the DI. The only thing I dislike about it is that the 12ax7 preamp tube is a bit gimacky, I personally have mine bypassed as I found the amp sounded better with it not in the circuit, so it's not a major con against the amp.  I plan on getting a 410 extension cab in case I have gigs where the PA is crap.   </TEXT>

In summation notation, Find such that Sum(An) from n = 1...2k and      Sum(An) from n = 1...2k+1 where k ranges from 1...infinity such that the above two series converge, but the series Sum(An) n=1...k does not converge.

I just don't think this is actually possible.  I don't see a way that you could take two convergent sequences, and when you add them suddenly they diverge.   </TEXT>
