	<TEXT> That's actually something I forgot to include. The smell of hockey equipment disgusts those who don't play but you love it when you're a hockey player! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a game tonight so I'll double check the fit and let you know but I had them fitted by a guy at Hockey Giant (who seemed to know what he was doing) and baked. The padding is just super thick where the blisters are forming.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The pain I get is from the rubbing. When I first put the skates on, walk out to the ice and skate for a bit there's no pain. But after skating for a while I start to feel it rubbing. The blisters are on the inside of my feet, right below the ankle. I don't feel my foot moving but it definitely is if I'm getting blisters like these. Is it possible that I'm tying my skates too tight? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Breaking in Bauer Skates </TITLE>

	<TEXT> First post on here! So after having CCM Vector 6.0 for the past 10 years I decided it was time to get new skates. I went to Hockey Giant and decided on Bauer Vapor X500. Skates felt good in store, got my feet measured to make sure I got the right fit and I got them baked also. Today I played open hockey with them for about 2 hours, I could feel the blisters forming. I have 2 pretty decent sized blisters in the same exact spot on the inside of both of my feet. Since they're blistering in the same spot I'm hoping I just need to skate with them more to break them in. Any ideas? </TEXT>
