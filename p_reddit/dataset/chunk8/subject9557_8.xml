	<TEXT> The entire concept of Razers Blade series represents a compromise, too: its a gaming laptop thats much smaller and more portable than almost any other PC gaming machine, but that comes at the sacrifice of the long-term upgradability that a desktop or even a bulkier laptop provides. Like Microsofts Surfaces or Apples MacBooks, the Blade is a closed machine  even the RAM is soldered down, and youll void your warranty just by cracking open the case. So whatever specs you buy it with are what youll be stuck with forever. Fortunately, the newly upgraded Blade packs some serious specs that should carry it for a couple of years. </TEXT>

Stark shouldn't even be in this movie.  It is like they were afraid of it failing so they brought in a few ringers. It's sad and pathetic. I don't thing I would watch it for free. How is it that they keep messing up these movies. Who thought Vulture would be a good villain for a movie?  I didn't even like him in the comics.

	<TEXT> There are many approaches to solar fuels: react carbon dioxide with water to produce hydrocarbons and less water. Another approach is to crack water to make hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can be used directly or reacted with carbon dioxide (or carbon monoxide) to create hydrocarbons. In either case, the energy used to drive the processes is renewable, so you end up with carbon-neutral fuel.

They drive them through the fields on the back of trailers and they remove the tassels.  They have few people follow behind to get one that were missed.

Watching them harvest corn is pretty interesting. They really have it down to a science.  The combine is all but automated, It drives in near perfect lines. Running along side the combine is a truck with an open trailer that the corn shots into. As the truck fills up, another takes it place.  Once a truck id full it drives to closest silo where it unloads and then goes back to the field.  The entire field is harvested by just a few drivers. I know a few tractor companies are about to start selling automated combines.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It hot, dirty muddy, dusty job. You a get sinus filled with corn pollen.  Even with sunblock you tend to get sunburned,. They paid $15 an hour so they never had problems finding workers. I did it once in high school.


Detasseling corn is removing the pollen-producing flowers, the tassel, from the tops of corn (maize) plants and placing them on the ground. It is a form of pollination control, employed to cross-breed, or hybridize, two varieties of corn.

Fields of corn that will be detasseled are planted with two varieties of corn. Every corn plant has both male and female parts, so if both varieties of corn were left intact, some of the resulting seeds would have non-hybrid parents. Removing the tassels from all the plants of one variety leaves the grain that is growing on those plants to be fertilized by the tassels of the other, resulting in a hybrid.

In addition to being more physically uniform, hybrid corn produces dramatically higher yields than corn produced by open pollination. With modern seed corn the varieties to hybridize are carefully selected so that the new variety will exhibit specific traits found in the parent plants. The detasseling process usually involves the use of both specialized machines and human labor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually corn cultivation really does not need that much migrant work unlike fruit which need plenty of migrant work.  With corn, Machines do most of the work the only real time you need temp workers is for detasseling and all teenagers in the local towns do that over the course of a weekend.  Beside detasseling, whole counties can be done by just a few people.
But this article is wrong. Japan currently is the Number one exporter. Mexico buys 23% And if the US has a surplus they just turn it into corn syrup which seems to be in everything now.

	<TEXT> The Guy? Trump is now supporting a bi-partisan bill that is being worked on in congress as we speak.  Trump's original plan was terrible. He wanted to auction visas to the highest bidder. So only the biggest companies would get them.  Now he has changed his mind and is backing the bill in congress. A bill that has plenty of backing by Democrats and GOP. It will pass.

H1-B Visas were supposed to be for people with master and doctorates.

	<TEXT> SATURDAY AM UPDATE: Disney's Beauty and the Beast is looking at a monster second weekend, appearing as if it might outperform even the most optimistic expectations after it brought in an estimated $23.6 million on Friday. Disney is estimating a weekend in the low-to-mid $80s while rival studios estimate it may actually top $90 million, dropping less than 50% for a second weekend that will rank in the all-time top five as it pushes well over $300 million in just ten days.

Elsewhere, Lionsgate's Power Rangers is leading the weekend's new releases raking in nearly $15 million on Friday, heading toward a three-day opening in the low $40 millions. The film scored an "A" CinemaScore from opening day audiences, of which 30% were under the age of 18 and scored the film an "A+".

Sony's Life brought in an estimated $4.4 million heading toward a three-day weekend around $13 million while WB's CHiPs is performing mostly as expected, bringing in an estimated $2.6 million on Friday, heading toward a three-day around $7.6 million.

You can check out all of Friday estimates right here and we'll be back tomorrow morning with a complete look at the weekend estimates. </TEXT>
