	<TEXT> Anxiousness about everything. Then people also shame you by calling  you names and tell you to "calm the fuck down". It makes you question so many things. Sometimes your doubts are legit but people will tell you to not worry. Then you wonder about when you should be serious and when to just relax. It's hard to balance fun and seriousness.   
Then you wonder if over-analyzing is actually a strength or your weakness. You just start to wonder so many things and people tell you to calm down. It's a frustrating feeling of self-doubt.

	<TEXT> I was jogging in the park at around 7 PM. I wasn't afraid of the dark and I was going at that time for a lot of days. That evening the park was quite empty as usual and I was simply exercising like any other day.  
A guy came up to me and asked me what time it is. I told him I don't have a watch or phone. I kept doing my business and thought he'd go away.  
After few seconds he came up to me from behind and started walking besides me. I didn't think much of it initially. Then he asked me "would you like to do setting?" That means "would you like to have sex?" in this context. I didn't understand what he said for first two or three times and then when he saw I couldn't get his point straight, he straight away went to grab my penis. He had just touched over the area lightly when I understood what he wants and I ran as fast as I could. I was scared and kept running. I got out of that park as quick was possible and then vowed never to go there in the dark.  
I have no problem with homosexuals but for fuck's sake don't go grabbing someone's penis without consent. That's sexual harassment.  </TEXT>
