	<TEXT> About two months ago, I lost my virginity, and it was great! The only problem was; I didn't ejaculate. We were at it for a good 30-40 minutes and I was just there like :| so I decided to stop what I knew the issue was; and while I've only been at it for about a week, I feel good, but it's rough, especially with all of the nsfw posts on Reddit... But I won't give in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone I don't know if this is the correct sub for this but I need some help.

For a good year now, we've been planning a holiday to Croatia and my ex is there too. Now me and my ex have been on good terms since we broke up about 9 months ago.
Recently I've been really missing what we had, I walked her home plenty of times in the 9 months, and we always have a laugh.
Anyway I told a friend that I miss her and that even though we're going on holiday together in July.
Now a rumour is going around saying that I'm going to "get her alone and do something to her"
I only found out about this because my ex confronted me.
All I want to know is who said it; I don't want to do anything to them, I just want to stay away from them, but if I don't find out who it is, then my whole holiday is going to be awkward as fuck.
I need some advice on what to do :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, so 2 minutes ago I walked out of the gym in a really shitty way. I was doing the RR and I thought, instead of a wall plank, I'll do a stomach-to-wall handstand. Got in the position but after about 15-20 seconds I began to feel weak in the shoulders so I tried to dismount. Instead of elegantly twisting to a sit down, I shuffled forward and my right shoulder twisted and crunched. It hurt for a good 2-3 minutes but then I said sod it and went to do the dip bar balance, where I had to stop.

I feel bad because I didn't finish my workout and I feel worse because my fucking shoulder kills </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today was the first time doing a completely bodyweight workout. I have to admit I feel achy but I feel amazing, which I haven't felt coming out from the gym in a long time. I did the recommended routine using the app. The reason I done it? Well I'm 18 years old and have been hitting the gym 4 times a week, but haven't noticed any improvements. I am on /r/fitness quite a bit mainly lurking, and have always known about this sub but was too eh to give it a go. But yesterday I was looking on YouTube at calisthenics routines, and found a lot of success stories, more than any other routine or method; also a few that I saw were younger than me!
