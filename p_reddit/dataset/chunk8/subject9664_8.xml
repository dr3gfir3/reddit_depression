	<TEXT> The fact that you are posting this suggests that you have doubts about how you are living. The risk you are running is that as you age these doubts will develop into regrets. 

If you are honestly and truly happy with yourself and believe you will continue to be over the coming decades, there is nothing that needs to be changed. As long as you are not trying to fool yourself out of fear of failure. There is a lot of joy to be found in the world. You only get one go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome reply, I agree with a lot of what you said. A large part of why I want to get over my cheese hatred is to experience these cuisines they way they're meant to be. I love asian food and when I go there I want to try all the food the way they locals eat it. Luckily with almost all asia food I don't need to worry about cheese at all. If I go to Mexico or somewhere, I don't want to be the guy saying "This, but without cheese please" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good comment. I think there's something in the "this is how it's supposed to taste" thing. A large part of it is mindset. It's interesting you mentioned cilantro, I'm the only person in my family that likes it, I can't get enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love food and I love cooking. I consider myself to be fairly open minded with food and I love trying new food, especially different cuisines when travelling. However I find it very frustrating when there is food that I "don't like".

For me cheese is the worst one. It's annoying because it's in so many different dishes, and everyone seems to love it except for me. 

When I was a kid I wouldn't eat any cheese at all. Now I can eat mozzarella and Halloumi, which are probably the least cheesy cheeses. I can't even eat a bit of mild cheddar. 

I don't expect to be eating strong blue cheeses anytime soon, but is there a way to train yourself to some extent to enjoy a food that you previously didn't like? Or do I have to just accept that I'll never enjoy cheese? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a strawman. I've taken exactly what you said.

It depends what you mean by "unable to function mentally". Most humans who are mentally handicapped in some way are still fully conscious, still feel emotion the same way as everyone else, still are self aware in a way that most animals aren't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Animals are Living and thus Innately valuable"

Plants are also living. So are bacteria. 

I think a better system is to not act like all living things are equal, but to examine to what kind of rights are deserving of what kind of animals. 

I believe that Humans deserve more rights than animals because we have a much higher level of understanding and awareness, and higher capacity for emotional suffering. 

In the same way, I believe that Chimpanzees also deserve a fair amount of rights because they are very intelligent, social creatures, that have emotions. I think most people would agree that it is not ethical to farm chimpanzees for this reason.

Chickens also deserve rights, of course, they should not have to suffer severe pain and stress, but they essentially do not have the same level of understanding, emotion and intelligence than humans or chimpanzees.

Ants have no real emotional capacity and we therefore do not lose much sleep if we accidentally step on one.

Animals can be placed on a scale from the most intelligent and emotional at the top to the least at the bottom. Doesn't it make more sense to give rights based on where an animal falls on this scale rather than equal rights to all? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I relate to what you're saying. You have to get over your anxieties and accept every invitation you get, otherwise it will be a spiral that just gets worse. I wouldn't worry about the facebook thing. I know plenty of people that live life to the absolute fullest and have empty facebook profiles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that link really says that breasts are not biologically sexual, or that it's entirely a modern western thing.

I agree that there are many cultures that have no problem with bare breasts. There are also come cultures that are fine with complete nudity, it doesn't mean that genitals are not sexual in their culture.

The sexualisation of breasts varies from place to place, as it is a mixture of culture and biology. In the modern west breasts are probably more sexualised than anywhere else. That is our culture, I agree.

So what point are you making, that we should break down the "cultural" side, and ignore the biological side. Why try and change such a prevalent cultural feeling for such a relatively minor gain. There are also positive aspects to the sexualisation of breasts remember.

Also, an interesting read: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201305/sexual-wiring-womens-breasts </TEXT>
