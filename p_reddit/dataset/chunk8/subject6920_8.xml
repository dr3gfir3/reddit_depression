A guy that worked next to me as an engineer that retired last year was certainly never more than middle class but saved very responsibly over decades and was able to retire with a 1.5mil. This isn't some hedge fund manager, it's just a run of the mill engineer that was responsible with his savings. He shouldn't be denied social security for being responsible imo. I do understand why people would be upset at someone with tens or hundreds of millions collecting though.  </TEXT>
