	<TEXT> Using state and local law enforcement to enforce federal law is not really possible.  Who pays the bill?  Further, local law enforcement can't hold people in jail waiting for federal authorities to pick them up without changing a person with a crime.  That is against a person's rights.  Where I live in Minnesota, the courts have said they can only hold a person in jail for no longer than 48 hours without charging them with a crime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lift several times a week, do long runs, and long bike rides.  From my experience with lifting, it is almost impossible to build muscle when fasting, but the HGH boost after day 3 of a fast is cool.  I have dead-lifted the most weight on day 5 of a fast.  I fast to stay lean, and the performance benefits for endurance are real.  I cycle between feasting and fasting.  I eat a keto diet and do 3-5 day fasts.  I don't eat much sugar and carbs because they make me puffy.  For myself, keto and fasting rock!

More info on HGH and fasting: https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/fasting-and-growth-hormone-physiology-part-3/
Brad Pilon is also a good resource for lifting and fasting.

[All the Presidents Lies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/opinion/all-the-presidents-lies.html)

"But the current president of the United States lies. He lies in ways that no American politician ever has before. He has lied about  among many other things  Obamas birthplace, John F. Kennedys assassination, Sept. 11, the Iraq War, ISIS, NATO, military veterans, Mexican immigrants, Muslim immigrants, anti-Semitic attacks, the unemployment rate, the murder rate, the Electoral College, voter fraud and his groping of women." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Republicans are bootstrappy people.  /s

Memory is short.  Before Social Security, there were many retired poor people.  These people literally had nothing.  They were homeless, living on the street with no food, and no job.  It was sad.  The Social Security program changed that.  However, Republicans bash it all the time.  They have no hearts. </TEXT>
