	<TEXT> This is such a wonderful piece of artwork from user [Daria_O](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?members/daria_o.38306/) who submitted this on the Terraria forums. I believe it's based on a character from Monster Hunter according to the comments. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. Daria_O if you see this and wanted to post this yourself I'll be happy to take it down but I just wanted the community to see this awesomeness :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a quick google of Eunji's age as I saw an update from Bomi saying they were both half way to being 50. What I got was this. Bomi's age is untouched.

P.S. The date shown isn't even her real birthday LOL I'm so confused rn

Edit: The dates seem to be for someone else. Don't know why it's been mixed up with Eunji. </TEXT>
