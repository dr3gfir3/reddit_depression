	<TEXT> [Canadian universities see rise in U.S. applicants](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/canadian-universities-see-rise-in-us-applicants/article33713288/)

At many Canadian universities, applications from U.S. students for the 2017-18 academic year are up between 20 per cent and 80 per cent compared to last year, an informal survey conducted by The Globe and Mail shows. Even smaller schools such as Trent University in Peterborough, Ont., say they have seen applications from the United States increase by more than 60 per cent.

	<TEXT> I guess it depends on what the expectation is. Americans get MRI's something like twice as much as in other countries. Some of these aren't needed, but in countries with socialized medicine it's common to wait a month or 2 for a non-urgent MRI. This is a lower quality care when the MRI is needed. But, no question the US could cut costs quite a bit without impacting quality, just not to the point of say Canada. </TEXT>
