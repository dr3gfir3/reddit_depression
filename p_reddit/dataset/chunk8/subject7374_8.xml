	<TEXT> It's a joke. The original Dune novel is considered a sci-fi bible by some. David Lynch's movie adaptation is seen by some as vastly inferior to the source material. Therefore, to enjoy the novelisation of a film seen inferior to the original book can be seen as sacrilegious by invested or die-hard fans of the original novel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you like one-take music videos, I have a few to suggest. The following five were done by the New Zealand band Goodshirt roughly 4 to 5 years before OK Go did "Here It Goes Again".

["Blowing Dirt"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzLBfBtknxk) where a car gets undestroyed.

["Green"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcxnKYsseAw) where the band members freshen up...side down.

["Place To Be"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIQDk0vpKGk) where odd things happen. Well, odd for the early 2000's in a New Zealand apartment complex.

["Sophie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePo9G-Rzr9k) where sneak increases to 9001.

["Monotone"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEPpkxj_hRw) where...look, it's beekeepers playing badminton, it's shot in reverse like "Blowing Dirt" and only one point is scored. That's basically it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wasn't a bullet I dodged. It was a discus.

Basically, it was Sports Day at high school and I, not being the most athletic person in the world, volunteered to help with the events, like measuring long jumps and adjusting the bar at the high jump...and measuring discus throws.

So, I'm standing quite a way to the side of the big marked area on the field for legal discus throws, waiting for the next person to throw so I could measure the distance. Anyway, the next person throws and I'm watching the discus soar high into the sky and come back down...straight at my face.

At this point, any normal person would duck or dive out of the way without hesitation. But not me. I'm watching it come towards me for a good few seconds before my mind clicks and I think "Huh, that's coming towards me." Cool as a cucumber (for some fucking reason), I take a single step to the right...and not a moment too soon. As soon as my left foot makes contact with the ground again, the discus hurtles past my left ear so closely that I can hear the bacteria on the discus laughing at me and thuds into the ground behind me.

It wasn't until halfway through bringing the discus back to the throwing cage that rational thought caught up with me, making me break down out of breath at what could have just happened.

And that's the story about how I nearly got killed by a discus.

Don't do sports, kids; it's fucking dangerous out there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In 'House Of Cards', Frank Underwood says "Proximity to power deludes some into thinking they wield it."

Therefore, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that those in proximity to the most powerful person, who in this context knows everything and would thus be the worst person, would believe that they, too, know everything.

So, you're right. </TEXT>
