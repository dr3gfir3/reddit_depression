I thought that the fact that the article was directed solely at Democrats would make the point, but I guess I was wrong.

Democrats consistently are the party pushing for more and more restrictions on vaping.

- More against GMOs than Republicans, despite them being safe.

Obama directly threatened the Uk in that speech by saying if they vote for Brexit they'll be "at the back of the queue in trade". If that's not infringing on sovereignty I don't know what is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The argument is they are willing to do work that others aren't.

That is a separate argument. That doesn't change the fact that it is a commonly-held belief that pay below minimum wage helps keep the price of goods low in America, and that is a reason to not deport illegal aliens. Democrats are simultaneously for cheap labor (through illegal aliens) and for a living wage. These beliefs are in direct contradiction with each other. That was my original point.

And just because you lost an argument doesn't mean insulting the other person makes you win. Try to be more civil next time. You're embarrassing yourself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not moving the goalposts. You are not understanding my argument. It is a common argument among those on the left that illegal immigrants are a necessary part of the workforce because they illegally work for below minimum wage, keeping prices down.

It is also a common cry for the left to have a "living wage" be minimum wage, commonly at $15.00 an hour. This is in direct conflict with that above statement.

It is also common for people on the left to ask for amnesty for illegals. This takes away the entire first argument, as they will need to be paid minimum wage, which again, many want to nearly double.

So, there is blatant hypocrisy from Democrats regarding these points. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Minimum wage is still cheap labor, retard.

Not if it's raised to $15.00/hr like many Democrats want. I urge you to check your facts because you clearly seem to be misinformed. I would suggest that you try to educate yourself more before you enter into a debate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If illegals are made legal they will need to be paid minimum wage, thereby taking away the "cheap labor" that Democrats so often talk about as a reason to not deport them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well yeah. But right now they're not, and never have been. They could lose EVERY seat in 2018. You can't say gerrymandering is costing Democrats a majority until it actually does.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. Democrats constantly advocate for a "living minimum wage", but when the topic of being more forceful on enforcing immigration laws comes up, it's always "we need that cheap labor to keep prices down!" It makes no sense to me. </TEXT>
