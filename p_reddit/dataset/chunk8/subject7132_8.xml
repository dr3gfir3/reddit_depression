	<TEXT> An interesting perspective. I'm not sure that I agree with all of it. I do have a passion for politics. I do post most often to political threads. At the same time, it would strike me as odd to characterize me as a spammer. 

I've posted two articles to r/Michigan, ever. Both are topically relevant to Michigan. If I read an article and deem it worthy of posting to inspire dialogue, and do so in a reasonable manner, it would seem to me that this is in keeping with the spirit of Reddit. 

Please reconsider your stance.  </TEXT>

If the shit hits the fan, and you can get here, consider this an open invitation to a loving family (of atheists!) that champions science, civil rights and separation of church and state. We have a university up the street.

	<TEXT> I'd say check out Rocky Point in addition to the other suggestions. That puts you in a really cool spot - 10 minutes to downtown, but also on a small but really cool beach area with jet ski rentals, volleyball, and some great waterfront restaurants and bars. The rent may be above your price point but I'm not sure. I lived there for many years, and back then the entry level apartment was $800. Given the current market it's probably significantly higher. However, with a look I'd say, given your interests.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Phew. Well, that's a huge relief. I imagine my wife will be disappointed, though, as a scientist, engineer and aspiring astrophysicist, and as a chapter leader in Citizens Climate Lobby, to learn that all those hours have been wasted. 

 nbsp;

And I imagine my friend who owns the most accurate weather prediction service in the world, which she started after doing extensive work with HAARP, will be "sad" (to coin a trump parlance), too. And to think she's been simply chasing her tail.....To be clear, she holds degrees from two Ivys, high-level top secret government clearance, and a mathematical theory that she authored...and today she's being set straight by our own EPA on basic climate change science...that's gotta be a bit of a Debbie Downer. I think I'll call her and talk her up a little. I'll remind her that she's great in the kitchen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think so. It was meant to be a bit tongue in cheek, as I got caught up in the foil of your careful and eloquent analysis of Constitutional law versus Trump's brazen and belligerent, bull-in-China-shop, plundering of this highest office. It's...let's just say I'm with you in that it's utterly imperative that when we strike we win, and as such it's too soon to pull the trigger. I'll add that you are right to brandish critical thinking over irrational exuberance, given that an emotionally charged 57% approval rating for impeachment among Democrats is immaterial to gauging the success of impeachment proceedings - especially with a Republicsn senate. Ultimately, I think that where we may differ is that I fundamentally think that Trump has crossed the line, and egregiously so. Violation of emoluments, twice. Revocable trust. Wire tapping allegation, Obama. A stretch perhaps, but the adamant denial of any contact with Russia, staff included, proven to be lies at every turn. I have more, but the black and white gets more grey. 

Personally, I hope he goes away in cuffs. But I'll settle for impeachment, recusal, anything that stops the bleeding. The climate can't wait for this nonsense to play out for 4 (or 8) years, but I digress.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's great that you like the U.S. 

I think that you and I can agree that by "subjective opinion" you mean "results of a survey". 

Let's delve into this particular survey and kick the tires a bit - theirs and yours:

You understand that the sample was 21,000 people - internationals of mixed socioeconomic background? 

You read who conducted the survey? Wharton? US News and World Report? You know that both are conservative, right? (I ask because you lean conservative). 

So, assuming we are still together on this, where do we disconnect? 
Was it simply that their conclusions deviate from your own, or is there something about this data collection methodology that is broken? Science asks questions, so GetSoft4u, I ask: What is your basis for disregarding this survey?  </TEXT>
