	<TEXT> The Wild (2006) is one of those Disney films you NEVER hear people talk about nowadays. It's a movie that's pretty much faded into complete obscurity, and for good reason. It's just a boring, charmless, ugly rip-off of Madagascar and the Lion King. That sub-plot about the wildebeest wanting to eat lions was ridiculous too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm glad to hear Anya Taylor-Joy will be returning as Casey. Also, I hope we find out what happened to Casey's uncle. I know the look she gave the police officer hinted she would turn him in, but I want to see him pay.  </TEXT>
