	<TEXT> Don't listen to those idiots about security systems. They are a scam. This is what you need: 
25,000LM flood lights. When these things go off it's like a star just collapsed in your back yard. Blind your enemies. Keeps them from spotting the bear traps. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018R7DFU4/ref=psdc_14107631_t3_B01939UK3A

Next you gonna need some bear traps. Place them all over strategic places where a burglar or foreigner may try and enter.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/hunting/trapping-supplies/traps-snares%7C/pc/104791680/c/292649580/sc/288163080/minnesota-trapline-mb-550-closed-jaw-trap/2281673.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse.cmd%3FN%3D1109397

Next tie the whole thing together with a used Federal Signal Thunderbolt 1003 Civil Defense siren. Everyone ignores house alarms or car alarms. Trust me, ain't no one in a 3 mile radius of your apartment going to ignore a Thunderbolt 1003 going off. People will come if out of sheer annoyance to your aid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iWFDuZdb4

	<TEXT> Look security systems are a scam. Go down to your local hunting supply outlet and buy bear traps. Bear traps are the best security you could ever want. They don't sleep. They don't eat. There is no monthly fee. They will never stop. They will never leave you, and it would never hurt you, never shout at you, or get drunk and hit you, or say it was too busy to spend time with you. It would always be there. And it would die, to protect you. Of all the would-be Security Systems who came and went over the years, this bear trap, this machine, was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was the sanest choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To get that authentic German pretzel look and taste you need to "laugen". Use cooking grade lye (https://www.amazon.com/Grade-Sodium-Hydroxide-Micro-Beads/dp/B001EDBEZM) and give the buns a quick bath in a water lye solution. Score them after they dry out some. Always have a bottle of vinegar on hand and wear gloves/eye protection.

	<TEXT> The average NYPD cop makes $44,744 a year so that's roughly $186.00 per day (working 48 weeks/yr at 5 days per week). Lets figure in a $50/day equipment depreciation, vehicle maintenance, fuel cost per officer. So $266 per day per officer. Let's say they have 100 people in the security team. That's $26,000 per day. To account for overtime let's double that figure to $53K per day. Let's add $1000 per day per officer just for the hell of it. That brings our total to $153K per day. How in the hell is this costing $400K per day?? And I was just throwing money at it and I couldn't reasonably hit $400K.  </TEXT>

I'd recommend washing your sheets, any unmentionables, or anything else you own that a creep may find your scent on or sexually arousing. The obvious next step is changing your locks and bear traps. Bear trap previous points of entry etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kibble tame a lot of 150 rexes...breed the ones with the best stats. Rinse and repeat with the breed ones. We use the best male to mate with all the best females. Inbreeding helps with mutations obviously, so we try to breed daughters with the father again etc to get mutation in the que. Than we stack same generation with mutations into the next generation. Between generations e.g.: Gen 4 and Gen 5 there are in between generation breedings. So like Gen 4 father mating with the Gen 4-1 (as we call it) daughters to stack the mutations. Then we breed the best gen 4-X male with the gen 4-X females to produce gen 5. That way you get the best of both worlds the mutation carry over and the best natural stat carry over. To get to gen 6 we have probably breed over 70 or so rexes (EDIT per line, my tribe has 4 lines going right now). The shit ones go to the arena for boss fights! More Tek stuff! </TEXT>
