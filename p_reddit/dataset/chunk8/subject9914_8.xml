Coca Cola, for example. Do you think the guys who created Coke and did all the heavy lifting with marketing and distribution back in the day would agree with the SJW Coke commercials for a moment?
Hell no, they wouldn't. But the Left gets its tentacles over a product and then uses it to shove their shitty agenda down our throats.
It's really starting to get to me.

	<TEXT> The free market is great for many things, but if there's something it's TERRIBLE at is serving the minority.  If you are one of only a few vegetarians in your town, good luck waiting for the free market to produce a vegetarian restaurant in that town.  It's the same for sexual orientation.  If you live in San Francisco where there is a large gay population, you might be fine.  But if you live in a small, conservative, highly religious rural town?  If not for laws against discrimination, you'd probably have to move out. 

You say that my hypothetical situation is unlikely, but for a large part of American history it was the reality.  Prior to the civil rights movement, in many states, black people were treated as second class citizens. Where was the free market to come along and help them?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But a bakery doesn't have the right to refuse whoever they want; by law they cannot discriminate on the basis of race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.  Imagine if everyone were allowed to do this.  Imagine being gay and no wedding venues being willing to host you.  Imagine taxi drivers refusing service to black people.  Imagine restaurants that said "No catholics allowed." Is that the world you want to live in?  Maybe you'd say yes, you wouldn't mind that kind of world because then business owners would be "free." But that sort of freedom comes at a heavy cost, creating a hostile environment where the minority will always suffer at the hands of the majority.  

I guess it comes down to this: what is worse to you?  People being forced to provide goods and services to those they hate?  Or people not being able to obtain goods and services from those they are hated by? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Blitz Attack, Guilty Gears version of the Focus Attack, has also been significantly changed. It allows players to go into a stance that allows them to soak up one hit before attacking. Unfortunately, Guilty Gear is a very offensive game and there was little use for this defensive maneuver. So Rev2 is going to change it to be a more offensive tool.
While originally players could only use this technique while in neutral, now they can cancel into it from normals. The first thing this change does is create new combo paths into characters Blitz Attacks. But the more significant thing this change does is turn the Blitz Attack into a sort of counter breaker. Now, if you think the opponent is going to somehow punish you from a defensive stance, you can use the Blitz Attack to bait it.

Very interesting </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure some of you have experienced this.  Microsoft IME has had this annoying bug for more than a decade.  It won't let you make hiragana the default input method when you switch to Japanese.  It always starts as romaji, and then you have to hit alt+tilde to make it type hiragana.  That means every time I wanna type Japanese, I gotta press windows + spacebar to swap to Japanese language, and then alt+tilde to go to hiragana.  Very annoying and inefficient.  Is there an alternative less annoying way to go about this? </TEXT>

Wtf, this is a downgrade.  I love how I could minimize the window and the sound would turn off.  I could watch youtube and play guilty gear without having to close the game.  Now I can't anymore.  Fuck this </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The experiment compared non-married Swedes versus married Swedes. Both groups were sampled from the same ethnic population.  In other words, they are taking genetics out of the equation. The only difference is environmental.

	<TEXT> Even removing the words "species" and "pure," his argument doesn't fair any better.  He's saying that a study on the effects of marriage don't apply to interacial couples because it was sampled from same-race couples. Which only makes sense if he believes there is a fundamental difference between the two.

	<TEXT> You don't even know what I'm talking about. I'm not asking for 2 players on one keyboard.  Revelator doesn't let you set buttons for player 2, period.  Only for player 1.  Even worse, if you plug in a gamepad, it automatically is set to player 1.  That means player 2 cannot have his buttons set unless BOTH players use pad.  This is retarded considering this worked perfectly well in SIGN.  Stop spreading misinformation you know nothing about </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it may have to do with the UI being unfinished.  The only glimpses we've had of the UI were in a few brief shots during the video presentation.  According to Daniel Bloodworth from Easy Allies, although Nintendo let people try out various game demos, nobody got to see the actual system UI. This leads me to believe that the UI is not yet in a presentable state, which may be why they haven't shown anything related to the touchscreen.   </TEXT>
