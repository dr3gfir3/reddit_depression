That's not what happened. Many Democrats have had high praise for Gorsuch in his career and even in his confirmation hearing. Supreme Court nominees are just about always confirmed smoothly and with grace by the minority party who may not share the same ideology. This was pure coordinated obstructionism, throwing a tantrum because the Democrats are out of power and want to derail the running of the country in any way they can. </TEXT>

Religion is a very powerful influence on cultural development though. It inspires the laws and the moral codes, and the fundamental existential philosophies of peoples. It is no easy task to separate religion from culture, and by extension the way a culture governs itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gay marriage. In the 1990s and early 2000s it was very unpopular and I agreed with the prevailing argument being made that it was unbiblical for a marriage to be made between two people of the same sex. I did approve of an equal legal partnership using a name other than marriage, and that seemed to be the way things were headed at the time.

After giving the issue much thought, I realized that in most cases marriage is separate from religion. You can be married in a church yet not be recognized by the government, and you can be married by the government yet not recognized by a church. They are two different things. Given that separation I became a supporter of gay marriage and got married myself. I still believe that countries which have a religion based government should maintain their strict marriage rules, but in countries with secular governments like the United States there is no excuse not to marry same sex couples. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Texas, which may be worse than the US in general. The way the trial was handled was very one-sided. The prosecutor was manipulative, using a lot of theatrics in front of the jury, going from a soft, calm voice to violent screaming, yelling disparaging remarks at family members in the gallery, bringing up the unrelated rape history of family members in the gallery and questioning their mental health as a result of their experiences, singing lullabies to frame the innocence of a child, etc etc. We had to remain silent and endure the things she was saying. She brought in expert after expert, all friends of hers, who happily admitted to being incompetent in their job of keeping track of people who are released on probation as justification for imposing a long sentence (the jury chooses the length of the sentence.) The defense was constantly shot down when they tried to make an argument or object. The judge did not allow any of the girl's history or her problems with the family and subsequent foster family to be mentioned. When the defendant attempted to bring it up the judge yelled at him and ordered the jury be removed from the room.

The jury spent many hours deliberating and was deadlocked. The judge quite forcefully instructed them to reach a decision, telling them if they could not reach a verdict another jury would be selected and it wouldn't be any easier for those people. He was anxious to go home since it was late at night by that time. When they finally did come back and started rattling off a list of not guiltys the judge was visibly irritated. I do not know the justification for the guilty verdicts. It was obvious that some jury members were upset by the prosecutor and hanging on her every word, but it's not like there was evidence to support the charges. The only actual evidence presented was his piracy of copyrighted material, which I guess was intended to frame him as a criminal in the minds of the jury. Completely unrelated to the charges in the trial though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The short version is that she was a teenager who didn't like rules and discipline. She had a habit of making up lies about family members when she didn't get what she wanted, which apparently happened quite frequently. There was a situation, I think she wanted a boy to move into the house and her parents refused. She responded with an extensive list of serious allegations which could land someone in prison for life. The family is large and not a single person believed a word she said, however it ended up in court. The case left a sour taste in my mouth regarding the justice system here. </TEXT>
