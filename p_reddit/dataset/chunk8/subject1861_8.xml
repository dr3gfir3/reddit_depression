	<TEXT> Unfortunately I haven't! Specialty salts are pretty rare around here. I'll keep a lookout for it the next time I go shopping at a food market. Thanks for the tip! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to say, it's much tastier than chicken and waffles (but also more expensive). I think it's mainly because (I went to have a look at the recipe book on Amazon) they cure and bake the duck in the oven (confit style) before they fry it so it makes for a much juicier meat. Also the egg they used was a duck egg - I never thought of putting a flakier salt on top of it (I'm guessing Maldon but I'm not sure) but it makes a real difference. I told my boyfriend after the meal that I was converting to duck eggs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you mean the jug beside the cup, it's maple syrup to go onto the waffles! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, just a regular plate. It was surprisingly filling though, despite the portion looking small. The duck leg was almost as long as the waffle and it was a really plump duck, so I ended up pretty full!  </TEXT>
