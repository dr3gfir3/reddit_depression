	<TEXT> hmm, maybe if you watch him play, as he's one of the most effective link up players we have, he's in a bad run or form along with every other player for us this year. He's a talent and he'll find his form again hopefully, once we change formation and stop being shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wanted to know what your thoughts were on that 2nd half formation change? I was happy to finally see a change in formation but it's just a shame we did when we were 2-0 down. Do you think the change helped the players? Would you like to see us change to that formation in the future?

This is how i saw the change last night

What opinions do you have on this, it's clear that the 4-3-3 is done and against lesser oppo i would love to see something different because we've been found out. </TEXT>
