	<TEXT> Hello and thanks in advance!

Basics:
Sheet will have data about a material. But materials will have different details provided for each of them. I have it set up with vlookup to call the data into this form sheet. Real general example below.

Material XYZ

 A           B
Color:    Red
Taste:    Sweet
Cost:     N/A
Etc.        Etc

Question: 
I'd like to create a macro-vba code that for a certain section (ex: A1:D30) to find any row with a N/A value and delete said row.

Thank you in advance! </TEXT>
