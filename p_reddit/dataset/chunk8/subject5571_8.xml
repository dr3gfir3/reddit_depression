	<TEXT> Well then I don't think all media is shite and unbiased. Interestingly ireland has one of the highest levels of distrust for their media but are also rated as being in the top ten least biased. I wonder if that's a happy marriage?

And yeah I was really playing devil's advocate. Bias is something we all have but I would see agenda as something deliberate and negative. I have a bias but that's my own business and I can't really control how it comes out. If I have an agenda I want to convince you. </TEXT>

While I think we're close, there's no truly impartial media. Christ I'm a fairly open minded person but I would have an agenda. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We all have bias.

Recently a US soldier was killed by "Friendly Fire". I would say an American soldier shot and killed another American soldier. They both mean the same thing, but I simply see it slightly different. I'm not misleading anyone and my bias is clear enough for someone else to say "You know what, I agree/disagree with that terminology".

The problem lies in stuff like "Travellers cause riot in streets of Dublin" and then show footage of a completely unrelated event. Or repeated articles lambasting one political party and never saying anything negative about another.

I'm smart enough to know to look for alternative sources but if all I hear from major news broadcasters is X, I don't think I can say that I would be *entirely* immune to it.

And not everyone is able to make that decision. Why shouldn't people trust a national paper? Why should I doubt it? It looks legit, maybe the tabloids will pull my leg but a broadsheet? Nah...

It's not fair to assume people won't be influenced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're absolutely right, I don't discount the rest of the game story, the CO thing is just my own preference but as a whole Oblivion was a much more fun experience and each quest was unique. That town with the "Deep One's", Christ that was creepy as hell.

If Skyrim was developed with the same vigor for quest originality as Oblivion then it would have been incredible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *You guys!*

Seriously, either way I think the big difference is who the main protagonist is in the Oblivion story vs Skyrim.

If Dragonborn dies (yes there is speculation that there are others but you're the only one who is aware of it) the realm is done for.[citation needed]

If the hero of Kvatch dies im sure the blades could find someone else. I mean, it is *their job* to protect the heir. If Martin were to die during the main quest then Cyrodil is done for.[citation needed] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title Dragonborn/Nevarine/Chosen One isn't really the thing for me, it's that I see the main quest as being about Martin Septim whereas the main quests in TES III   V are about you. That's a big thing for me in fantasy lore/storylines.

For me in Oblivion it was exactly that, you could have been anyone, that's the problem for me, not that it actually is a problem. It's a preference thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can understand that. If it's just another elder scrolls experience then I imagine Skywind will do great.

I for one loved the challenge of exploring the landscape. Christ it was a trek getting around but it made you appreciate where you were and you tended to stay in one town and do a lot their, forcing you to get to know the people and the stories better because you couldn't just fast travel to another place. Yes silt striders are a thing but they were limited to certain towns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the premise behind the main story, as a Dragonborn, is better than Oblivion yes. I think the individual execution of the quests in Skyrim though, main quest included, are tedious. While I found Oblivion's main quest less interesting, I thought the implementation of the quests was quite good. If the main quest story in Skyrim was implemented better I would be happier.

Essentially I'm coming from a "Chosen One" preference like Morrowind, I felt that in Oblivion you were more like "the chosen one's chosen one" but I know that's my own bias. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I love the game, I dont know if anyone who has played Oblivion or Skyrim first will like it as much, and that's fair enough. It was a brilliant game for its time, legacy has left it looking old. I think nostalgia is a big part of it. Hopefully Skywind will help in that aspect but it would have to incorporate all of the original mechanics and skills for it to work at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I went back to Arena and Daggerfall but Morrowind was the first and most nostalgic to me.

Yeah, sadly I've seen many of my favorite games subject to this consoleification *trust me it's a real word* like the Fallout series. But fingers crossed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think you were antagonistic, your criticism was good, doesn't make you a dick.

Regarding Martin Septim, I guess my issue is that he is still the one who saves the day. I take your point about the Hero of Kvatch being the one who saves him. The role is definitely not futile. It's simply a case of preference for me that you spend so much time saving him as opposed to having a more central role like the other games.

Regarding Magic, I don't think I clarified my point because what you said was right too. I simply meant that the power/cost of magic is better, you can play as a straight mage in Skyrim without finding it impossibly tedious.

They stripped away more spells and an entire school. To be honest I don't particularly enjoy magic in either games. I think Morrowind had it right. Oblivion's magic, while varied, is impossibly hard to use at high levels without amassing a huge amount of fortify magika items and spells. And playing as a true mage (while fun much more fun) is very challenging because of this. Whereas, in my opinion, you can play as a straight mage in Skyrim and not find it impossible past level 15, the power balance is back.

Regarding the quests, I agree. My main point above was that the quests in Skyrim were less exciting than oblivion. Getting to be arch mage in Oblivion took time and effort and above all else it was fun.

At the end of the day I find myself comparing everything to Morrowind. That's probably not fair of me to do but I don't think Magic or quest depth has come close since. </TEXT>
