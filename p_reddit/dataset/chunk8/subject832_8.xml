	<TITLE> Just started citalopram. Questions about work? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-11 09:12:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started a new temporary job (4 week contract) on Friday. I decided to start my citalopram on Friday afternoon. The side effects I feel are fairly minimal compared to what I was expecting/what other people suffer from, but the nausea and the feeling spaced out and tired is a bit of a struggle. I am still in training and I am worried I won't be able to handle it. I also have an interview tomorrow for a full time position.

I think I may have bitten off more than I can chew. I need time off sick but I can't take that from a temp contract that is only 4 weeks I have to power through. Trouble is its a job involving customer care and answering phone calls but talking makes me feel sick and I can't understand people over the phone very well right now. 

Any tips? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if I would call it transphobia. I have been following stefsanjati on YouTube for ages on her journey of MtF trans and I am fascinated and inspired by her.

I think it's the people like I described in my post above who aren't firmly in one camp or the other. Is there any such thing as genderfluid-phobia? Perhaps that is more accurate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to work in a supermarket and there was a man who dressed just the way you described.

Only he had a handbag and nail polish and hair bands and the whole lot...but he still had a good inch of beard on him. The girl who was serving them had an issue with the purchase and she said to our supervisor 'can you help me with this man's items' clearly not thinking to say 'this customer' instead and the customer threw a fit about how they were a woman, not a man. It's always made me feel uncomfortable since.

 Perhaps it's the not knowing how to refer to them and walking on eggshells?

I still believe people should be able to wear what they want as long as it isn't hurting anyone else but I can't get past the feeling that people should wear the clothing assigned to their gender. Even writing that out feels wrong. Why does it even matter, really?

	<DATE> 2016-06-29 02:35:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Once I was a young, stupid teenage girl and I fell for a 32 year old. I have always been an all or nothing kind of girl, so when I fell for him hard I just assumed he felt the same way. When I found out I didn't even know his name- his job, where he lived; ANYTHING about him, I was crushed. Not only was my trust in him destroyed, but I have later come to learn that my trust in men in general has been abolished.

Nearly 4 years later I have been in relationship with another man but t has been tainted throughout with my insecurity, my jealousy and my failure to trust him through no fault of his own. These traits pushed him away from me until he was unfaithful to me last year, further crushing my trust in men and removing my self esteem entirely.

A few weeks ago I acknowledged my anxiety issues and resolved to try and fix them: since then my SO has been away on business and whilst he was away told me he was afraid he had committed too young (we are both 23) and didn't want to miss the wild parts of his life. He also doesn't want to break up. I am convinced that he doesn't take this relationship seriously, and when I googled it, from a man's perspective I seem to check 8/10 boxes for reasons to break up with your girlfriend and I am so upset.

It's true I am jealous and insecure. I am nervous and feel unworthy of a partner like mine. But I never chose these feelings they were given to me. I don't know how to make them go away. Him cheating on me really didn't help.

I have possibly fucked up the most amazing thing to have ever happened to me in having my SO love me (once) and I don't know what to do.

Is there anyone with any experience here who can tell me their thoughts? How can I fight back the insecurity? How can I make him feel less drained by my awful behaviour? Please help. :(

Also if you're going to tell me to break up with him please don't. I've thought about it plenty and I am ready should that be the option I have to take- but it is my last resort. I want to fix this, not toss it away.

Thank you for your time. </TEXT>
