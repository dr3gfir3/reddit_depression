	<TEXT> 1.4g scores are very common. Most dealers I know bag them at that. Good ones will give you 1.8 but hard to find. And quality of weed also comes into question  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep! they put it in a 50p plastic pot off eBay and sell it as Cali. 220z good weed in east London. Can get 180 but that quality bud don't get me high.  
Cheese, lemon  amp; amnesia is all that's about in east London. That I can get hold off anyway. Lots of Cali skunk but 50 1g is something I'm not willing to pay. 
There's a lot of spainsh amnesia about. Looks  amp; smells lovely but you can smoke a whole oz  amp; wont get high. It's good your getting good strains and right price. U.K. Growers need to grow proper strains and wouldn't be a need for Cali import. Locking up a China man in a house and expecting top quality bud ain't gonna happen. Enjoy the smoke.  </TEXT>
