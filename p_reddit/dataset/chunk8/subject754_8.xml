	<TEXT> I didn't get one until senior year, and the thing that sealed the deal was that I liked to do extracurricular activities (specifically build road and mountain bike frames). Grades are important, but you need to distinguish yourself somehow because there will always be upperclassmen competing for the same job. 

And no, pay generally isn't enough to pay for school, however it can help out quite a bit if you get a good one. Most internships pay in the neighborhood of $12 to $20 an hour, but petroleum jobs can make upwards of $25, and I've heard of up to $40 per hour (those are really competitive though).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just graduated from Mines this December in Mechanical Engineering, but I know several Petroleum folks and I got job offers from 2 Oil   Gas companies as well as interviewing with a few others. 

The school is much harder than many other schools so you'll come out very well prepared (and employers know this, even as a MechE many companies were interested in me, despite me knowing nearly nothing about oil). Don't expect to be partying all the time, although the Petroleum department is notorious for having a more rowdy crowd than the rest of the school. 

Also, if you like the outdoors you'll have a fantastic time.

Overall, if you like to work hard and play hard you'll love it at mines. And you'll love the starting paycheck at the end of the 4 or 5 years it takes you.

Edit: Get an internship early if you can because they can be both very lucrative and can open up a bunch of other opportunities. For example, my former roommate had a summer internship that paid more than I'm making right now as a fulltime employee. Now he's making right around 100k a year, right out of college.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the main reasons this happens is because they're likely very sad that you turned them down. In their eyes you're a great match, someone they could see themselves with for a long time, but you don't see it that way. You've just relegated your relationship with him to casual conversations and group events, nothing more. 

Speaking from experience, it's very hard to see someone often who has turned you down. It's hard to be reminded everyday that your feelings are completely unrequited. Because of this some people will choose to just move on to keep from feeling hurt, and although it makes you sad you've lost an acquaintance it's much more sad for them because they've lost a potential soul mate. 

TL;DR: It's uncomfortable for everyone involved

	<TEXT> The Mini-14 is less accurate (as a target shooter I was getting approx 2 MOA with mine, as opposed to .75-.50 MOA with my home-built AR), but GOD DAMN is it reliable. I inherited mine from my uncle, and it had about 2000 rounds through it with zero malfunctions before it got a cleaning. For that reason alone I'm never going to sell it. 

The AR platform is more picky, but you can built it any way you want to. Want a super cheap lead slinger? Bingo, spend $600, build it yourself and you're done. Want a 1000 yard target rifle? Take some time, pick your components, and build it over a year or two and tune it (and your ammo) to what works best for you. 

The Mini-14 is more of a one trick pony. It'll give you undefeatable reliability and 2 MOA accuracy all day, every day of its life. It's a simple rifle, so if you want to run fancy EOTech optics, 60 round mags, and a 1 point sling like the Operator you are, then look towards the AR. But if you want a simple, easy to use rifle that will *never* let you down, look long and hard at the Mini-14 platform.

	<TEXT>  On my second Saiga-12, I had a trigger spring failure after less than 100 rounds, where the hammer spring that resets the trigger after each shot became dislodged (This may have been from firing only full-power loads on a custom adjustable gas plug which had yet to be configured correctly). I had to push the trigger forward manually to fire another round until I broke the gun down and replaced the spring with an aftermarket model that had tighter tolerance and was intended for competition guns. No problems since then.
 

I had the exact same problem with my Saiga. I only shot birdshot out of it, so it must be a slightly faulty design. Pain in the ass to work around when you're in a competition. 

Mine also wouldn't reliably cycle (with birdshot) if there was any hint of dust in the area. I went to a dry, dusty, and windy 3 gun competition and couldn't get more than 3 consecutive shots all day without a failure to feed, eject, etc. Granted, I hadn't polished and honed any of the internal surfaces, but you shouldn't need to do a ton of work in order for a gun to function properly out of the box.

I sold the Saiga for more than I bought it for, went back to my trusty 870, and I've never looked back since. I like the idea of a Saiga, but not the execution.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How did you get into building the truck for the baja 1000?

Well I was into modifying jeeps and things and was part of my school's informal racing club. A few friends had also been on the SAE mini baja team, and since they did well at competition they wanted to design the real deal. I knew a decent amount about rear-end suspension design from working on Jeeps, so when they asked if I wanted to help out I jumped at the opportunity. It's just me and three others with no involvement from the school. 

What fields are you getting job offers from?

I got 2 job offers from oil and gas, 1 from a CAD software company, and two from mechanical-specific companies (I got the job offer today woohoo!).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just graduated in December from a very good engineering college with a decent GPA (3.26). For the month after graduation I didn't really hear anything from employers which was a bit unnerving. In the last month though I have gotten 4 job offers and have an interview tomorrow that will hopefully increase that number. It's a lot of work, but if you apply many places and have some good experience on your resume you won't have a problem. 

Pro tip: experience doesn't have to be an internship. It definitely helps to have 1 or 2, but it's not a dealbreaker if you don't have one every single summer. Get some hands-on experience (almost nobody straight out of school has real hands on building experience). For instance, I'm helping design and build a full size race truck for the Baja 1000. That project alone has gotten me a huge amount of interest from employers, even more so than my 1 internship. 

1 thing: some companies are very picky about having a 3.0 GPA. I know of a wonderful person who let her grades slip because she was taking 20 credit hours. Despite the fact that she has a security clearance, lots of experience, and a good personality most of the aerospace companies won't even look at her resume. Just keep up the good work, apply everywhere, and something will come along.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree. When somebody is in that mindset of wanting to end it all, they don't really care how it's done. The reason there are so many gun-related suicides is because it's just a convenient option. If guns are outlawed due to suicides, then knife, hanging, and drug suicide rates will rise. 

If somebody has made the choice to end it all, they're going to find a way to do it. We need to focus on helping them, and not on banning the method they use to commit suicide.  </TEXT>

I didn't know that she liked to shoot, so I was pleasantly surprised when she expressed interest in going shooting with me. Here's a pic of us two (we're the two on the right), and some of me teaching some other people how to shoot though.

I was an officer in the Colorado School of Mines shooting sports club until I graduated. Our club would take freshman dorm floors to an outdoor shooting range, teach them the fundamentals of safe shooting, and provide various firearms for them to try as we watched. It was a ton of fun, and over the years many of the freshmen joined our club after going on an outing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went trap shooting with another redditor last weekend. We hit the range at around 10:30, shot 3 rounds apiece, and headed out. She hadn't shot trap before, but had been bird hunting several times. I was surprised at her good stance, and she was hitting more than she missed despite it being her first time. After we were done, I walked with her down to the skeet and sporting clay ranges and explained the differences between the 3 sports. 

Then, as we were leaving the range I accidentally drove off with the electronic scorecard that keeps track of how much you shoot. I called them later that day and mailed it back to them with a check for $20 and an apology letter. I still feel stupid about it, but I'm glad I didn't lose their scorecard system. 

Overall it was a good day. 20 degree temps and overcast, just us two on the range, and plenty of fun was had.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A slightly more manly stance means a *drastic* decrease in accuracy. For standing you want your elbow bone resting on your hip bone so as little weight as possible is supported by muscle. That way you don't tire and start to shake. 

[This photo has a good description of proper stance](http://frostedbutts.com/TTAG/15/8.jpg)

Just imagine holding [this tactical stance](http://www.everycitizenasoldier.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/positions/S_ModOff.jpg) for 75 minutes straight (not including any finals or tiebreakers). By the end of 10 mins your abs would be burning, your arms would be tired, and your bent knees would be a shaking wreck. At 50m you'd be lucky to even hit the paper after 75 mins of a tactical stance, whereas many olympians have gotten perfect scores by hitting the tiny 10.4 mm center ring (the bullseye is only .5mm (.02 inches) for 10m air rifle (posted above), or about the size of a 12 pt. period).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Without a post-weld heat treatment aluminum is very brittle. If a weld repair is done there is a very high chance that it will quickly crack again in the heat affected zone of the weld. 

Unless you feel like stripping all the paint, TIG welding the crack, and finding a very large, very hot, and very precise oven to use for several hours, I'd say it's much easier to just get a new frame under warrantee or through personal finds. </TEXT>

A 56% grade is approximately a 35.9 degree slope
