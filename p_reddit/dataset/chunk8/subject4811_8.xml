	<TEXT> I walked into the wrong apartment...I must have. There's a man sitting at a table very much like mine. His face is covered with something red. Strings of yellow and pink are dangling from his mouth. He looks rabid. I am trying very hard not to make a sound as I back away from him, my hand is scrabbling behind me for the doorknob. 

I bump something.

The man turns. His face is smeared with meat and gooey red matter. He looks startled, but smiles, extending a chunk of that horrendous substance toward me. 

"Want some?"

I turn pale as a sheet and turn around to yank the door open, only glimpsing the number on the apartment for a split second. Wrong number. Thank god. I run as fast as I can for safety.

Back in the apartment the man takes another bite of his meat-lovers pizza and shakes his head. "Crazy vegans."
