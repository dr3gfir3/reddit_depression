	<TEXT> The closer to the center, the more distortion. When vinyl is mastered to maximize sound quality, the dead wax area is large. To see this taken to its extreme, see the 45 RPM single-sided 200g pressings of Willie Nelson's Stardust or the Cowboy Junkies Trinity Sessions </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh? Considering I've helped install 3 LP-120s and 4 Carbon DCs I may have a bit of personal knowledge. Neither 'table is perfect. Pro-Ject's QC however is woeful. Two had a hum due to bad wiring in the tonearm. One had a platter that wobbled. One was perfect.  Of the LP-120s, none had performance issues although the fit and finish could be better. 

I think the DC sounds better. But it's not nearly as sturdy, has that idiotic anti-skating counterweight/fishing lure, and is much harder to use if one wants to play anything but LPs or wants to swap cartridges. You also need a pre-amp to use it. The 120 OTOH can use standard 1/2" mount headshells or carts with built in mounts, has 78 RPM built in, and can plug in to anything that accepts analog input. Both have their place.  </TEXT>

So; to be in that world, and say such a thing to a Chef that has earned even one Michelin Star, much less two or three, is somewhat equivalent to standing in front of a guy offering you a job you very badly want, and kicking him square in the nuts. Most people in the world that call themselves a Chef are nothing of the sort. </TEXT>

On occasion his wife has used his phone to invite me over for a meal and i answer the same. In such cases she responds "hi bitch!" Now, if his area code pops up but is not his number i certainly don't answer the same.

 While this was a familiar area code it wasn't a caller ID directly attributable to her. So a good chance existed that she wasn't the one calling.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IF you actually wish to apologize for the offense you caused: Call the Chef you offended, he likely will not answer. Leave him a voicemail simply stating that you are calling only to offer an apology of the utmost sincerity, that you are mortified, and that you appreciate that he was considerate enough to take the time to call you. Be upfront and contrite. Have a text prepared that you send immediately after you've ended the call that asks him please not to delete the voicemail, that you know the position is no longer available and you merely wish to apologize because your conduct was so reprehensible. 

In the meantime; go find someplace else to work that isn't as notable. Give it a month or two, then start applying elsewhere, and be upfront with those to whom you apply as well. If you truly have talent, you'll get back in. If not there, plan to move elsewhere and pursue your passion. 

I'd also ask for a quick meeting with your old boss after you call, and explain in person. 

But here's the deal... people have recovered from far worse. You said some stuff on a phonecall. It's not like you were caught banging his spouse bent over the pass.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sigh. I think it's the first bullet, myself. Old and unplayable but original seems to carry the day. Me? I threw away over 2000 records in the late 80's, and I like to listen what's left of my collection for the most part. I don;t want a lot of records any more. I want the ones I like to listen to and with that I refuse to pay $20 for anything on vinyl, new or old. Although I have bought a few... :-)

That's about the size of it! Not only that; knowing there's very rarely any 'provenance' for modern vinyl and I may very well be buying vinyl that was sourced from a 192Kbps MP3 in some cases and a 44.1/16 file in far more, I stay far far away. I very seriously doubt most modern reissues are sourced from the original analog.

I've been lucky to find great stuff in the bargain bins and have equipment that plays even semi-thrashed vinyl well. So, I stick to digital for new and vinyl for old. European pressings seem to be better than US; so if you can find 'em on Ebay or in the used bins, grab them. I have a ton of W. German 70s rock that is glorious. All from Half-Price Books. </TEXT>

If I'm reading the service manuals correctly, the Onkyo amp is made up of discrete transistors which is vastly superior to the chip amps utilized in the Technics. This is from a period when Onkyo were very much a step up..

EDIT: Here's an Audiokarma thread on the US versions which were largely identical except for an inferior radio tuner. The 7530 appears to be equivalent to the TX-830.

One like this perhaps?

	<TITLE> 9550 Bluescreen Fix </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-27 21:43:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my 9550 has bluescreened ever since the mobo was replaced (first one stopped powering on). At first it was at random every few days and started getting worse and worse to where it would bluescreen regularly every 2-6 hours. The problem would get worse when multitasking and using memory intensive software. 

I was unpacking from a trip and noticed one of the screws on the bottom of the machine was loose. Went ahead and took the bottom off, cleaned out a ton of dust, and carefully but firmly reseated the memory. This seems to have done the trick or at least greatly helped; I've gone two days now without a bluescreen.  </TEXT>

I haven't seen anything about changes to the display between the 9550 and 9560; I would assume the display will continue unchanged. The GPU is of course changing from Nvidia 960M to 1050. </TEXT>

This x 9000. If you see the words "buy here pay here", "square deal", "certified used (and they don't sell new cars","We finance anybody", RUN. Most such places buy clapped-out cars at auction and make sure they run just long enough to get past whatever period exists by law that the dealer might be on the hook.

They come with earfoams that help you get a good seal; a little shut-in on the top end but the midband is quite liquid with solid well defined bass. Image is far better than I've ever had with earbuds. Very coherent if not pinpoint precise. These are not going to be "I can tell the third chair cello had a burrito for lunch" detailed; but you will totally get lost in the music and enjoy them thoroughly in a way you don't with 'phones you'll spend far more on.

Many Jews in Israel and elsewhere disagree with the actions taken on settlements just as many Americans disagree with the course of action America takes and so on and so forth. So, getting down to brass tacks, what's your problem with those that identify as Jewish given you think people should stop identifying as Jews. 

Follow on: Are Jews the only problem or should members of other religions similarly stop identifying? Should Muslims stop identifying as Muslim? Would that help solve the territorial/governmental issues in Syria, Turkey and elsewhere? If not, why is it only the Jews that should stop identifying? Or is it religion as a whole? Please do explain because the point seems awfully inconsistent unless applies globally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never have mentioned Sonos. I'm comparing the Phantoms to other similarly priced equipment. They occupy a unique space at present. For $5k and just 2 channel? I can build a system that'll easily best them sonically. Apples to apples would just be a 2 channel amp and speakers. No sources. Will they be as versatile or easy to use? No. Again, it's all the particular use case </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No this was a full five channel setup. I should have clarified. So although the rears may not do as much they still fully factor into the cost. I refrained from asking the guy why he didn't just go with the standard Phantoms for the rears. He was elated although that may have been due to the vast increase in WAF with relatively equivalent performance.  </TEXT>
