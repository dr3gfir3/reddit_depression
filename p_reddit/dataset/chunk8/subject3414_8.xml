	<TEXT> Watching the moive Shrek in primary school, and the boy sitting next to me kept talking. After I asked him nicely a few times, and didnt shut up. 
My 8 year old self, turned to him and said in an outside voice, "JUST SHUT UP! IM TRYING TO WATCH SHREK", he turned around and said "Why dont you shut up, no one wants to watch it anyway". And with all my little girl anger I slapped him across the face. Unknown that the teacher was watching, walked over and told the boy to take a walk, and gave me a lolly pop and said that if he was my age, would have done the same thing.  </TEXT>

How much you use will depend on length and thickness. 
I pop it on my hair, twist and clip my hair down, and then put a shower cap over and leave for about 2-4 hours. 
The important bit, wash it out with organic shampoo and conditioner first, then wash your hair with the everyday shampoo and conditioner you use.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as I hated deleting him of facebook - It needed to happen. 
Its not like its was an immature move, I just know it would have been harder for the both of us. 
Like I would have hated to see him with his new gf (who he cheated on me with), that would have been heart breaking at the time. 
Its funny you mention moving down, because as soon as I was told I wasnt keeping my job, I decided to move to the same state as him. He wasnt happy about that (obviously didnt want me to find out about his other girlfriend). Cracks in the relationship formed which lead to the breakup, and then a few weeks later me finding out he was cheating. 
As shit of a week as it was, fuck I am glad it happened. Imagine staying with him longer and not knowing about the other girl. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recovery for me was actually quite easy. 
I was able to pick up a job within a few days after it all, and i'd never had a job like that as such, there was so much learning to do, and I hardly ever got a moment to myself as the workload was so big. Which worked in my favor, as in previous breakups, i'd dwell on everything that went wrong and how I could have fixed it. 
I removed and blocked all social media, deleted contact information for him and his family members, deleted photos, you name it, it was gone. I needed to focus on myself, and not on him, so when I did this, I had no way to check up on him. I didnt remember his phone number, so I couldnt text or ring him. I literally had no way to contact him. Best decision I made. 
And lastly, I realized i'd fallen in love and comfortable within the relationship, not actually the person I was with. I was traveling back and forth from one state to another every weekend for 7 months, going from country town to big city. Once in the city, i'd be going out for dinner to different restaurants each night, going to cute little cafes to grab coffee, and finding tucked away bar/lounges and catching up with friends and making new. It was the ideal life style for me. Once I realized that I was happy being comfortable and not actually happy, my world just turned 360 and it was the one thing that kicked the breakup into overdrive.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this feeling, all too well. 
When my ex and I broke up, I was devastated. 
It took me about 3 months and accepting an apology that I never will get, to realized, I missed the life I was living with him.
Living in the country and going to stay with him in the city every weekend, being able to go out and do extravagant things and do so much in a day and a half because thats all the time we had with each other each week. Being in social scenes I could only dream about, the whole 9 yards.
It sucks.
