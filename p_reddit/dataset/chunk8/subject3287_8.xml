	<TEXT> When the heck did I call it a cure? I said it was an escape, and there is nothing wrong with using (harmless - compared to other options like self-harm or substance abuse) escapes especially when you're dealing with something for which it feels like there's no cure in sight. The fact of the matter is it's an effective escape meaning a lot of the players are people struggling with that kind of thing, and it's foolish for Riot to implement things that alienate people who are struggling because that's their playerbase. Also I disagree - you can learn to communicate and be decent when socializing without feeling like you have to be part of any sort of consistent group.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose you have a point there. My point with this post was not so much as people NEEDING the rewards, it's more the sense of how people without friends or people to play with are being made to feel like they're less deserving of reward than those that do. It's not a good message to send to a youth fanbase. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ^ You can get stomped and still show effort. Contrast this to the SKT vs SUP game, that was also a stomp but you could see SUP were less flippant about it, playing strategically rather than "we didn't practice so we're going to just not try and maybe play for KDA" like G2 were here, even if they were simply outclassed mechanically.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah he didn't actually miss a game, they played him (which was funny since they did have Stixxay listed as a sub at the time. Dlift also got a penta that weekend iirc) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a fun fact about Kiwikid: on top of all the "anti-records" they mentioned him holding re: most deaths, he actually holds the LCS record for most regular season games being the only player in NA LCS (and only player alongside Yellowstar if you count both EU and NA) to have played in every single *regular season* game, never missing one. Of other players who have played in all splits, Dlift missed a few for CLG's ill-fated S4 korean boot camp and Zion missed a week due to a suspension in S5. He also holds the record for most splits played signed to a single team ([source](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/LCS_Players)) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole argument that "teams like DIG being in the LCS just makes other teams complacent" is hilarious because one of the things DIG was actually *good* at historically was punishing complacency. You can argue that dig didn't strive for anything beyond mediocrity but how many times did they upset teams who underestimated them? The ol' "dig upset telling another team they need to get their shit together" that happened more than once every split was one of my favorite staples of every season and why I'm sad to see them go. Getting rid of DIG is not going to make NA better. They may have not been a top tier team at any point but they were never a team to just roll over and die to a top team that wasn't trying. </TEXT>
