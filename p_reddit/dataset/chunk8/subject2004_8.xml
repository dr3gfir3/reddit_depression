	<TEXT> It's tricky. Because fear of rejection is a very real thing, and I think it's healthy to have it to some extent so you don't get cocky. At the same time though it stays with me forever. I can remember the first girl that turned me down in second grade when I tried to give her a valentine. If I think about that moment it still makes me start sweating and want to go hide in a closet somewhere, 20 years later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha it makes sense. There's a few girls that are too attractive to approach, because I make assumptions about their personality, attitude, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would it not have been a better strategy to focus the bulk of the Reich's forces on the European Allies and Americans, THEN focus on Russia? The logistical nightmare of trying to invade Russia just seems like too much. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Women of Reddit- What's the difference between you calling a man hot, cute, or handsome? Are they all interchangeable? Does one term lessen the level of attraction you have to them? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've always been pretty insecure, with everything. It's a strange feeling. If I cook a meal, I always wonder if people like it, no matter how many compliments I get. If I leave the house, I always wonder if I look okay to the women who are in the same vicinity as me. Even in school I always wondered if girls found me ugly, no matter how many compliments or dates I got. I try to hide it though, cause I know it's annoying. But it's always in the back of my mind, just digging. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. If you are attractive in any way, I will wonder what you look like naked, and will probably try to think of ways I could get you into the sack. The key in these situations is to use self control and make your brain control your dick brain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My list is pretty simple and some of the things are completely arbitrary. I don't like women with short hair. I don't like body hair. I don't like girls who smoke(cigarettes), I don't like girls who drink heavily. I don't like when girls spend hours bitching about their friends behind their backs. That's about it! I'm sure I could think of a few more if I wanted to but that's it for now. </TEXT>
