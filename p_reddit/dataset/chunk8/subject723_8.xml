	<TEXT> On September 8, 1982, Feast of the Birth of Mary, within the context of a papal address to the sick (who so much need to know the power of co-redemptive suffering), John Paul calls Mary the Co-redemptrix of humanity for the first time: Mary, though conceived and born without the taint of sin, participated in a marvelous way in the sufferings of her divine Son, in order to be Coredemptrix of humanity. 

I agree that all salvation comes through Christ alone.  Your Church does not seem to agree with us, however.
My remark about Roman Catholics in hell stands on its own merits.  
"If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  Romans 10:9 
If the ignorant, misled have never prayed to Christ, only the pantheon of "Saints"-then they are damned.  
And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.

Consider that you can't sell the damn things at full value or very quickly (cut it down to say 250,000)-now you barely have enough for a tiny London flat.  Also consider you have to launder/account for all that new money AND worry about the other 5 ratting you out and cheating you.

	<TEXT> I'm not ignorant and I'm not mistaken.  The fine point you paint your Marian "devotion" with is lost on 90% of the laity.  I'd wager there are RC who go their entire lives praying to St Anne or Mary-feeling too distant from Christ or God to pray directly to them.  Mary is so much more fluffy and lovable than mean old Jesus and Jehovah!Those Catholics are in hell.

And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.

	<TEXT> Nope-the Second Eve dynamic is heresy.  We know there were heresies being promulgated even earlier than this one, so it's antiquity does not lend it legitimacy.  We know that it was Adams sin that condemned us-not Eve's.  We also have no indication that Jesus thought of her this way at all!  Eve was Adams wife.  Mary is Jesus's mother-they are NOT the same.
Co-redemptrix means exactly what it sounds  like.  That's why it's a heresy to call Mary that.  You can use the same logic to give David co-redeemer status.  Nobody does because he doesn't give the warm, soft, not-judgements fuzzy feeling that Mary does.  

Jesus is who we pray to, look to, worship, adore, hold as gracious and the ONLY mediator.  Mary sinned.

Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

Matthew 10:29-31

Our consciousness, even when we are as close as we will possibly be with God in eternity future, is still a separate thing from God's consciousness.  We aren't a drop falling into the ocean-we are eternally distinct creatures.  That thought, in and of itself, is kind of terrifying! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am completely uninterested in a debate because I know it will change your opinion and practice not a whit.  So,  if your goal is closeness to Christ and loving people better brings you closer to Him (it does), then go for it.  
Do not be surprised by the visceral Reformed Christian reaction against the extreme Marian devotion that we sometimes see that seems to blurs the lines.  I also feel like this extreme devotion is trotted out sometimes simply to illicit that reaction.- exploiting that "weakness" in an unedifying way.  At least that has been my experience in this sub on occasion.  Of course, not all my posts or comments are especially edifying either-I confess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mostly moderate to large-sized evangelical churches.  I guess maybe half of my teaching pastors have been PhDs.  Grew up mainly in independent and southern Baptist churches.
I'm at the Church at Brook Hills in Birmingham AL. (Like 4500 member, but our small group is like 8 families).  We had David Platt for several years (wonderful) before he went to the IMB.  Now we have a Matt Mason who does not boast the same educational pedigree, but is clearly who God has chosen for this Church at this time. 
I guess my point is even mega-churches can be led by men who are qualified in God's eyes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree-the responsibility lies with the Church-not some educational institution beholden to its board and endowment.  
That being said, Church elders should be less impressed by the degree-maybe even to the point of, gasp, considering candidates who do NOT have a PhD.  Just sayin.  The "market" drives the demand-the Church being the "market". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it reflects spiritual and actual immaturity.  Also a critical flaw in the education of our ministers.  They aren't actually required to believe anything they teach!  Degrees and worldly accolades count more than sheer holiness.  If my son is called to ministry, I will think and pray intensely about advising anything beyond an M Div. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as answering questions, I can see you've been as selective as I have, at least.

So, how did matter get here, again?  It was energy, right?  How did that energy get here?  Why do these things act in certain ways but not in others?  You've demonstrated that you have no real answers to any of these questions.  In fairness, you just don't have the equipment to answer them, so you pretend they can't be answered and aren't important.  That's fine.

In answer to the OP's question, in a universe (multiverse is a nonsense word, put down the comic book) of cause and effect, science cannot answer the question of cause.  Period.  So, matter is the ultimate argument for a Creator or uncaused Cause.

	<TEXT> No, not really.   The two situations are analogous, but no analogy is perfect, just instructive.  Poking a hole in an analogy is a piece of cake (see what I did there?).  Let's go through the holes Humes pokes.

1.  Ignorance of the process doesn't preclude design or a Designer.  As finite beings, we might not even have the capacity to comprehend the process.  All we do know is God spoke-and from nothing, something.
2.  Here is the question of perception-ours is, and always will be limited.  However, it is amazing to note that the farther we look, or the closer we look, we perceive evidence of order.  There is not chaos.  That was laPlaces point-that every effect, if you can catalogue all the variables, can be traced to a cause.  A Cause.
3.  This is the most bizarre point-it seems to misunderstand itself and is essentially nonsense.  Any environment in which everything was made would be part of everything and therefore made at the same time-it would be part of the universe.
4.  We do have evidence that a sentient Being made a universe-this one!  The word universe encompasses everything-so there could not be another.  Again, nonsense.

Your point about all the evidence being absent is just a lack of processing power or a willful blindness.  I suppose it could be both.

Humes argument is just flash with little substance.  It plays well with a British accent, but makes little sense in the real world.  In some sense he takes advantage of the differences in scale.  But changes in scale do not help your argument at all.  Your point about inferring design according to differences between artificial and "natural" objects breaks down when the scale changes.  If you look at a rock microscopically it has patterns that adhere to laws-the same as the piece of cake.  That's the point.  "Natural characteristics" are designed-so there must be a Designer.  
In a universe of cause and effect, it must gall you to be in the side that denies there's a cause.

So, again.  Matter.  It's there... </TEXT>
