	<TEXT> It's a lot to do with the fact that rabbits are the UK's third most popular pet. But like you mentioned, number one most neglected. :/ They're readily available in almost all pet shops and marketed at children, but are rarely handed over with any sort of educational materials for the new owners. Despite them being the third most popular pet, we have no laws on keeping them - only very vague guidelines that state that they need to be kept in a 'suitable' environment for their breed, kept safe, fed and watered. (We have a few rabbit charities which are fighting for rabbit welfare laws, however.)

Unfortunately this leads to the outdated concept of keeping a rabbit in the smallest hutch possible in people's back gardens with inadequate food and forgetting all about it. Then to local teenagers stealing rabbits from hutches 'for laughs', and ultimately either setting them free into the wild (usually with their pet dog on its tail) because they don't know what else to do with it, or... doing things like this. 

Rabbits getting stolen and then tortured by scummy teenagers is really common in the UK. I had one taken from my garden when I was a kid. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm always making little toys for my three to play with. Rabbits definitely tend to prefer the edible kind the most! Here's a few ideas that I use.

Buy bunches of different twigs, apple, willow, kiwi etc and tie them in bunches or shapes, then either leave them around on the floor or hang up as a chewable mobile. 

You can also dip slightly wet branches (or lollipop sticks) into dried herbs then set aside to dry and you have tasty herby twigs!

Get some small pieces of hessian jute. It's a woven natural material. Put healthy treats/herbs/flowers into the middle of the square, then pull up all the sides and bunch them together making a little sack. Tie the top and you have a little throw bag for the bunnies to sniff, scratch and try furiously to get into.

Peg veggies and edible flowers from a long, tied up piece of string to make edible bunting! in the same vein, thread dried fruit and veggies onto some twine and hang up for an edible garland.

	<TEXT> Thank you! She's a little sweetie and seems to love all the fuss she gets when having her picture taken (she loves a fuss in general, from me and the other buns!). So she'll happily let you dress her up all day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my gosh, what a cute little fluffball!

Looks a lot like my boy did when he first came to me! Then all his puffy fur around his body moulted away and he just kept his mane, moustache and tufty knees!

My Ollie is a lionhead x lop. http://i.imgur.com/49VNMMh.jpg  Please excuse his derp face.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually interested in this as well, as I had no idea that their rabbits were rescues. There's no information in their store about it whatsoever. I'm sending another email to the regional manager, so I'll ask about it and see what rescue/charity they're paired with - if any! I'll mention the bonding and ask if they've tried alternate flooring too!

Gosh, if he really is a rescue then I feel even worse for him, getting 'rescued' only to be stuck in a tiny cage in a pet shop all day serving as their store mascot!

Also, would you mind sharing the websites you do your bunny supply shopping with? :) I've tried a few like zooplus, but I just find them so expensive and then with all the shipping costs on top, compared to physical stores. I'm shopping with Pets at Home mostly (as they gave us lots of advice and help with finding vet care for Elric when we first rescued him) but would preferably like to find an online store that has an extensive rabbit range and won't cost me an arm and a leg. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  sender of the email complaint.

'Bumper' is not the store's meet and greet rabbit as I used to visit at least once a week, if not twice, and every pen has always been occupied by single black rabbits for months on end. This was my first encounter with Bumper, who is all white. So he does not 'usually occupy one of the rabbit runs' in the slightest!

Bumper 'pushes' his hay away and doesn't like it in his area. He needs this survive! I can't say I've ever met a rabbit who pushes away hay, unless they're playing in it and digging! And this doesn't mean you take it away from them altogether!

I'm just at a loss for words. I'm not sure what else to do except contact the RSPCA. :( I wish I could rescue poor Bumper and get him away from there.

Please, please UK Rabbitors, don't support the Jollyes company, as even their higher management aren't educated in animals' needs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am. I've requested to join the group and I'm waiting be approved. I'll definitely take a look at that template and be sending a complaint to the store itself! 

I've already sent a complaint email to the Jollyes contact address I found and I'm going to send that same one in writing to the Jollyes head office also, so that I know that they've definitely got it.

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm the girlfriend in question, who saw this atrocity. It was Bradford, Manningham Retail Park store, today 18/08. I'm not exactly sure what time it was (I'd been out shopping for a while) but it was somewhere between 3.30pm-5pm. 

Please keep us updated! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reassurance. :) She's going for jabs, a check-up and a little treatment for sore hocks, so even if she does worry on the way there (it's a long drive and she's not the most confident bunny) at least she'll feel better when she gets back home! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all HUGS to you. 

And secondly, all of my bunnies are made to order. :) All the originals in the photos sold quite a while ago, so each one is now made after purchase. Custom bunnies are always welcome! 

I have a listing here where you can mix and match fabrics and colours that I already have in stock to create your own unique bunny. https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/169159108/custom-bunny-rabbit-plushie-you-design?

Plus, if you don't fancy any of those fabrics, you're completely welcome to suggest a colour/theme to me and I'll see if I can source some new materials that are within my budget. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No way! Lionheads are one of the most common breeds where I am. I also have a mini-lion. :)

Ollie was a lucky find, though. I was in my local pet store buying bunny food, when I saw him. He'd been given to them by someone who couldn't/didn't want to take care of him any more. He was in pretty bad condition. His coat was super brittle and dry, he looked absolutely miserable and all of his mane was completely matted to the point where when I watched him try to wash himself he got his claws stuck. I immediately took him home! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I've never really been a fan of mass produced soft toys. I loved stuffed animals and have been obsessed with them as long as I can remember, but I've always been ridiculously picky when it comes to which ones I want to own - even as a kid. I'm even less of a fan of them now that I make my own and can see what a huge difference there is between handmade and cheap mass production. 

I do try to market them as collectors items rather than toys. While they are very sturdily made, they probably wouldn't stand up to too much rough children's play. :) </TEXT>
