	<TITLE> Is it okay to hate a movie / director because they are popular? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-06 23:20:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I honestly can't stand most of the popular stuff. I'm talking about things like the Spiderman Franchise, Guardians of the Galaxy, the Nolan Batman films (Nolan in general really). I don't dislike them because of their inherent flaws, and they do have plenty of those, believe me, but because they are popular with the common man. And I think that's the point really, because the average man does not value great art, William Gaddis said so too in Agape Agape. That's why the popular taste and the taste of those of us who value art must fundamentally differ.

I'll make one exception though. I do love K-On, it's popular but still great, an anomaly, really.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you impress girls with your knowledge of movies? Suppose you are not only familiar with American films but also with European and Asian titles. You also know a lot about different directors, can discuss movies on a level beyond "I kinda liked it" and are even familiar with aspects of filmmaking. Now would it be possible to actually do something useful with all this, e.g. impressing girls to get laid? Asking for myself. </TEXT>
