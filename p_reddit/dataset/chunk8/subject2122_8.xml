	<TEXT> I agree with you on Ruffalo. He did a lot of mannerisms which made him stick out like a sore thumb in a movie that was going for realism.

Also, I didn't see any of the other nominees winning. Bridge of Spies was good but not great Spielberg, Mad Max: Fury Road was more of a technical accomplishment in the Academy's eyes, Brooklyn didn't get a lot of love in other categories, The Martian was too sci-fi, The Revenant was too love-it or hate-it within the Academy, Room was too small, and The Big Short was too comedic for them.

Hence, Spotlight. </TEXT>
