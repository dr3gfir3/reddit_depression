	<TEXT> I don't think it's personal. It's just annoying when "of-the-moment" fanboys here online declare everything that they watch to be the GOAT, WOAT, etc. Nothing can be anything other than two extremes. 

And call me crazy, but I think that it would lend more credibility if columnists, coaches, NBA personalities, and former players were the ones declaring LBJ the new GOAT instead of armchair fans. Unless these Cavs/LeBron fans know more about the game of basketball than former players.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lmao. Someone can have the opinion that Britney Spears  Mozart. Sure they're entitled to that opinion; it's still wrong.

You're also contradicting yourself. Previously you stated that you never watched Jordan, now you're saying you've seen his highlights. Which is it?

Moreover, this convo for GOAT wasn't 1A and 1B going into last night's game. One great performance doesn't automatically dismiss MJ or make LBJ leapfrog him. Beating a 42-win team and scoring 40 points doesn't make you the GOAT. It's happened many times before, and not just by Jordan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We thought that for every one person that wanted to do something negative, there would be thousands that wanted to overwrite that with something positiveand we were right. It turns out collaborating to make something bad is far harder than collaborating to make something good.

Mankind and existence at its basis, but maybe without the polarizing ideals. Negating creation is not decidedly **bad** nor is positive collaboration decidedly **good**. Creation and destruction are based on perspective. Even if the void had succeeded, it would still represent collaboration, for good or bad is a matter of opinion. </TEXT>

So is it possible for governments to carry Equity to balance out the equation? Do they have any Enterprise Value? Or does the Equity just zero out and Assets = Liabilities? </TEXT>
