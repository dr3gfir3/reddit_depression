	<TEXT> Ironically it was because I got a terrible massage from the prior therapist and was comped a massage with her. Our paths had actually crossed 10+ times in our lives as we've gotten to know each other better we started talking about places we've been. She used to shop in my store when I was a store manager, concerts we both attended even skating rinks as children. We spent the next year talking once or twice a month when I would come in. There was always a connection, it was innocent, but it was there and quite strong.  Facebook, the creepy thing that it is decided to let me know that I might know her and told me I should probably friend her. This was a year or so after I started coming in.  I obviously let her know about it and she told me I should probably friend her.  I one night just happened to ask if she wanted to grab dinner and a drink, honestly just assuming it would be as friends as I had no idea she had the feels and she had no clue I had the feels.  Clearly we were both wrong.  Hands down, the happiest I've been in my life since I've been with her.  We've got a daughter incoming in April.    </TEXT>
