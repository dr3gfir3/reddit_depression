	<TEXT>  Is that wih respect to Peters anomaly or in general?

You put forward a good question. I don't know if it's with respect to Peters Anomaly only. Their doctor, [the Fellowship Director of vision sciences at Sick Kids Toronto](http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Directory/People/A/Asim-Ali-Staff-Profile.html), probably explained this to us but the only thing that stuck to my mind was the low success rate. I remember asking what will happen if the body rejects the cornea and I was told that they will have to wait again until there's another donor.

	<TEXT> No quick answer. From what I understand from our doctor, their vision is most probably blurry on both eyes because they were born with the condition and the brain might not be able to learn to "see" good contrast. By the way, Roger have the condition on both eyes but it's very minimal on the left eye. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Roger and Gerry were born a day after my mother-in-law passed away from breast cancer. She was just in her early 60s. My wife, still reeling from her father's death (happened when she was pregnant with our other son), didn't know how to take it when we found out that both our twins have Peters Anomaly on their right eyes. 

It was difficult news to accept at first (specially that corneal transplant only have less than 30% success rate) but over time it turned out that what they have might have been a blessing in disguise. 

They could [read simple names and basic words](https://youtu.be/mqORAw6gDwc) before they turned 2. They also developed a good memory. They could recite (in order- I must add) the colors of the rainbow, days of the week, names of the months, the planets of the solar system, shapes from triangles to dodecahedron, etc... [Here's one of them reciting stuff at 3AM](https://youtu.be/nnYbBiyW1Oo). 

My sons vision might be blurry but their future is definitely bright! I'm feeling mighty proud!

Here's a [recent photo](http://i.imgur.com/1FrFwvB.jpg) of them with the Peters Anomaly in clear view.

	<TEXT> If from North America- Toronto, Canada to be precise. But yes, doctors over here can be a little quick to prescribe meds. But some doctors I know also suggest other things such as physical exercise and group therapy and what not. Anything can be easy when one is inspired. The repetitive tasks at hand becomes enjoyable and less of a chore. Finding the inspiration and the motivation to actually move is the hard part. But that shouldn't be a problem with someone with an open mind. Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lived somewhere in Antipolo when I was in college. This was back in 2002 I think. I came to Canada in November 2004. Drop by the gym. The head trainer is also Pinoy but born here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love fish but I can't stand a lot of the fish being sold here (I came from a small agricultural and fishing village somewhere in the Philippines). The taste is different. At least I get consistency in a can of sardines. LOL </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My family doctor knows my entire health background. I was on Lipitor and CPAP machine before I hit 30s. She don't want me to take high impact sports due to concerns about my joints and the plantar fasciitis. On the other hand, my sports doctor told me to just keep on doing what I do because I'm the better judge of my body. He gave me a few stretching routines and I'm all set.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you tried talking to a sports doctor? My family doctor discouraged me from doing high impact sports but my sports doctor, after physical checkup, taught me certain stretching routines and that helped me a lot in terms of pain management and stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to saute it with garlic, onions, tomatoes, and some spices. But doing so encourages me to eat more rice. So I decided to just eat it right out of the can with about half a cup to a cup of rice. I eat it with 5-10 colossal green olives and spinach or some other greens.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words! Not too long ago my knees would crack even when I'm just walking. Walking up the stairs was a big problem for me. The plantar fasciitis made everything worse. My doctor told me that the cartilage (or something like that) that protects the bones was thinning. I haven't had myself checked since Muay Thai but I can't even remember the last time my knees cracked while climbing the stairs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never played sports before and I was on Lipitor and had my CPAP machine even before I hit 30s. I felt so old I kid you not. Now I feel young again. :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I began my Zoloft medication at 25mg. Made me feel good and somehow gave me some confidence to go out and talk with the neighbors. When I reached 125mg I started feeling suicidal. We just had 6 deaths in the family within the last 4 years at the time and he had a terrible time coping. When I felt that the drugs are not taking me anywhere but a very dark place, I began my journey to fix my self the natural way. Really glad that I did. Proper nutrition, obsession to the sport, exposure therapy, and philosophy are my ammunition.  </TEXT>
