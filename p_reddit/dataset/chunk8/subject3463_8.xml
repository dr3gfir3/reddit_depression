	<TEXT> Congratulations, oh I saw you read Kokoro by Natsume Soseki, do you like it? :D

Im dealing with depression too, reading was my passion and could finish 12 books in a few weeks but now... last year I achieved 14 books in 12 months and this year I have only been able to read 1 book (snif), want to be a bookworm again.

These are some of the books I read last year and I would like to recommend; The Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham, 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke and The plague by Albert Camus, if you give them a chance I hope you like them, happy reading! </TEXT>
