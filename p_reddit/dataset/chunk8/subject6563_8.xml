	<TEXT> [Source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-blames-russia-putin-wikileaks-rele/) - honestly, where do you get your news?

On Oct. 7, however  the same day WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta  the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement that said, "The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations."

The statement added that the recent hacks "are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process."

The statement also said the intelligence community believes these attacks are directed from top levels of the Russian government, as Clinton said.

"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities," the statement said.

The U.S. Intelligence Community is made up of 17 agencies, forming the basis of Clintons claim.

The 17 agencies are: Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if you don't trust various (17 iirc) intelligence agencies of the united states both civilian and military who have mixed political affiliations (both sides of the aisle, axes to grind in either direction) that agree on this there's literally nothing i will be able to do to convince you. so i see your 'complete speculation' and raise you seventeen intelligence agencies in consensus - your move. provide some hard evidence the russian's didn't do it (or of who did), i guess? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> what influenced the voters were private emails not meant to be seen by the public. you saying the DNC has no right to privacy? a lot of what 'came out' of those emails was shit talk that you and i do all the time in emails privately. there was little in there that was newsworthy and even if there had been something truly damning and critical it should have come out legally, not through foreign interference.

setting that aside, russia hacked both sides. they could have released a ton of dirt on the republicans too, but they didn't. the had dirt on *both sides* and released only the dirt they thought would swing the campaign toward their pick (trump). this swayed the election. surely you can connect those dots. without russian involvement, the emails wouldn't have been leaked. so even if you 'blame clinton' russia remains a *critical player* in the action.

how well did it work? we'll probably never be able to quantify it, but it's fucked up from start to finish. trump *asked* a foreign power to hack us, then *reveled* in the spoils of that hack. so we have russia doing trump's dirty work. everything about his is ugly and depressing.

as an aside, if you approve of other countries hacking our systems then god help us all.

tl;dr russian hack - selective emails leaked - election influenced </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'll assume you're not joking and outline it for you. the rest you can go look up and fact check on your own. 
* (1) they hacked the DNC and the RNC, so they could have really fucked with both parties, but instead 
* (2) they released some pretty boring emails from the DNC with a few hot/controversial topics, derailing one and only one campaign in the process,
* (3) these emails became a rallying cry for critics of the clinton campaign and probably one of the most talked-about 'scandals' of the election by any reasonable metric (appeared in all media channels, debates, etc...). tl;dr they steered people from clinton toward trump

if you don't think that influenced any voters i'm sure you can go out and find some people who will tell you otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> see this is precisely what i mean. you make allegations but i'm going to go ahead with facts instead. first off, if you read the article whose headline you quoted: they meant it couldn't *literally and directly* be hacked by russia - not that russian hackers couldn't sway the election indirectly.

meanwhile, before election CNN: ["How Russia is trying to rig the US election" - 11/02](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/opinions/kremlin-trying-to-rig-election-nimmo-opinion/) or how about ["US finds growing evidence Russia feeding emails to WikiLeaks" - 10/24](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/russia-us-election/) - these are about hacking the DNC and using what they find to 'hack' (sway) the election.

If you just do a [date range Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=us+election+cnn+russia biw=1600 bih=799 source=lnt tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A9%2F1%2F2016%2Ccd_max%3A11%2F3%2F2016 tbm=) you'll find such headlines as "Vladimir Putin is trying to hack the election. What should US do ..." and "US blames Russia for targeting election systems"

the fact that you think (or hopefully now: thought) that cnn wasn't talking about russians hacking the elections in advance of the elections suggests to me you are reading fake news sites. the irony intensifies.

tl;dr you're either intentionally or accidentally conflating two uses of the term 'hacking' without actually reading the contents of the articles in question which clearly show there is no contradiction. </TEXT>
