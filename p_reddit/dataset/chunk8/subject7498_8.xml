	<TEXT> Thanks. Cat's Cradle and Sirens of Titan are the other two I read though. I liked them both but I think the war aspect of Slaughterhouse-Five was the most compelling for me. Mother Night is actually the next one I was going to check out, mainly for that reason. I think I may have to re-read them all sometime back to back to refresh my memory and make a proper comparison :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm only 50 pages into Catch-22 by Joseph Heller and I feel like i'm reading a new favorite of mine. I usually don't laugh out loud at books but it's doing that to me. The amazing part is i'm not sure I really know whats going on with the storyline yet but I feel like it's headed somewhere incredible. At least I hope so. Every scene appears to be so random but hilarious. 

So, what are some books that you picked up and thought to yourself early on...My God I love this book already...


**(POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS IN LINES BELOW)**

**UPDATE 1:**

The Nately's Old Man chapter - Woah, holding on to my seatbelt here it comes...

**UPDATE 2** 

All finished! It got so deep later on. I loved the switching back and forth between humor and tragedy. Will likely reread in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got you. Yeah in that case I think the dark blue cover should be fine. It will likely be smaller font size than the other one, but it should still all be there. Slaughterhouse-five is a short book to begin with so I don't see why anyone would want to cut anything out. It's not like Moby Dick or War and Peace where they have many abridged versions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the red color version and I really like it because the text is very spaced out. I'm thinking thats prolly the only difference. Also, Vonnegut has a bunch of his best sellers in that same type of print as the red color version. So if you think you might start a vonnegut collection I would go with that one for the consistently. Cat's Cradle is a light blue color which I also have and they are matching prints.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the same problem sometimes. And it's easy to suggest trying another type of book but I know It's not always that simple. Even books I really like I can still struggle with at certain times. Some things that help me.

-  As another person suggested, always do your best to get a good night sleep. 

-  Eat a wholesome meal. Don't eat too much though or you might need a nap. I find it much easier to focus when I have fuel in me. 

- Get some exercise. Doesn't need to be anything crazy. But just going for a walk for awhile will relax your mind in so many ways. If your constantly sitting there thinking about how you want to read more it will consume you.

- Hot shower. A clean body is a clean mind. Sounds weird but when I feel refreshed i'm at my best mentally. It will also wake you up temporarily. 

- Good lighting helps me visually and also keeps me awake.

- Find a nice chair to sit up in. This will better your chances of remaining awake and alert while reading. Laying down will make your mind think its time for that nap.

- Put your cell phone in another room! I read so much more when i'm not constantly pressed with the urge to check my phone. Just leave the ringer on in case someone calls because of an emergency.

- Read out loud to yourself. Sounds funny I know, but this really does help me when I can't seem to focus. Doing it for awhile allows me to comprehend what i'm reading. Then, go back to reading normally, you will feel like your reading lightning quick and taking it all in. 

- Do a little research on the background and topic of the book beforehand to get you into the mood of what its all about. Just be careful about spoilers. 

- Try some easy listening music in the background. I listen to classical sometimes to keep noises from distracting me. 

- May or may not be a good suggestion, but Coffee helps me focus. I drink tooo much coffee. So it's an addictive habit. Be careful. 

Hope any of these help. Good luck!

	<TEXT> I don't want to be cliche by saying 11/22/63 was life changing for me, but thats exactly what it was. Here's why in case anyone cares. 

About 8-9 months ago I was sitting around one weekend and downloaded 1984 by George Orwell. It was the first book I've read since probably 7 years ago while I was in high school and I really liked it. But then the next book I picked up from the library was 11/22/63 because I was interested in the JFK topic. This book made me obsessed with reading ever since. I started a reading challenge of popular books afterwards with a friend. And I have read nearly 50 books since then after not reading a single book in all my adult life.

So no matter what I read from here on out. No matter how many books I read that have more critical acclaim. And no matter what else I read by Stephen King, this one will always be one of my favorite books ever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's actually very readable. It's a story about one man, there are not many character names to remember, and the settings are painted very clearly. It's not like your reading a tough philosophy book where it's a slog to get through and hard to follow along. The only aspect which I could see it being difficult is understanding the deeper meanings to what's happening in the story and in his mind. But I think these can be discovered later on after the story is over with some help from the internet. I'll be honest, I'm still rather new at this reading thing. I only seriously got into it within the past year, and although I have been through college (non-literature related degree) I don't consider myself all that intelligent. With that in mind, I found The Stranger to be an easy read and very deep at the same time. The good part about it is it's a very short read! So if you find yourself not loving it you won't have very far to go until your finished. I read the Matthew Ward translation. Some may say other older translations are better, but this is the only one I have experience with and I found it simple to follow. Hope this helps!

Edit: Just noticed above. If you could understand A Clockwork Orange and love it then you won't have any issue with The Stranger :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually follow Goodreads guidelines pretty closely. But I tend to lean toward how much I enjoyed a book rather than how many stars I think it deserves. These often go hand in hand, however.

**1 - Star:** I disliked it and/or it was a chore to finish.

**2 - Star:** It was okay. I didn't dislike the book but it also didn't really enjoy the experience that much overall. I will mostly forget about the experience over time. 

**3 - Star:** I liked it. Reading it was enjoyable overall. Didn't love it but was glad I read it. I think there's this misconception that when someone rates a book 3 stars it means the book is below average because most books hold an average rating above 3. But I try not to think this way with my personal ratings. 3 should be middle ground. The rating system is simply not flexible enough to begin with. Why limit yourself by only rating things 4 and 5 stars if you don't reaaaallly like them. When you have many books rated 4 stars, but can identify some you definetely like more than others, then the latter should probably be a lower rating. 

**4 - Star:** I really really liked them and/or they were just a damned good read. Either way, I really enjoyed the reading experience. I'm just not ready to call them one of my favorite books. Because i'm not, there are some fantastic books i've read, and really enjoyed but did not give them 5 stars because they didn't have a long lasting effect on me.

**5 - Star:** This is reserved for books that are instant favorites of mine. I will come back to them someday and read it. There are moments when I was reading it and had to stop and put down the book and stare at the ceiling because I connected so much with it. If it didn't include these moments, they damn well sucked me into its world and left me with an enormous book hangover. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you gotta start with All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque

A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway is another great one. It's not as gritty as the one above, but it's very dark nonetheless.

	<TEXT> There's a bunch of relevant ones in **Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes.**


 "There are so many doors to open. I am impatient to begin."


 "...Don't feel sorry for me. I'm glad I had a second chance in life like you said to be smart because I learned a lot of things that I never knew were in this world, and I'm grateful I saw it even for a little bit."


 "Now I understand that one of the important reasons for going to college and getting an education is to learn that the things you've believed in all your life aren't true, and that nothing is what it appears to be."


"The path I choose through the maze makes me what I am. I am not only a thing, but also a way of being--one of many ways--and knowing the paths I have followed and the ones left to take will help me understand what I am becoming."
