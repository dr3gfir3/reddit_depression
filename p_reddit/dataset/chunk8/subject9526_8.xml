	<TEXT> If you're interested in our closest neighbour Andromeda, you can find a 1.5 billion pixel image of it on NASA's website. You can use a zoom tool to check out the star-specked corners of the massive galaxy.

The image was taken by Hubble and is the largest ever released. It shows over one hundred million stars in an area of about 40,000 light years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Double check that you have a roadside jack stored somewhere. Jumper cables are also essential, even if you aren't going on a long road trip. 

For the less essential, I find that if I'm going on a more or less wild camping trip, towels are extremely useful and can have multiple functions </TEXT>
