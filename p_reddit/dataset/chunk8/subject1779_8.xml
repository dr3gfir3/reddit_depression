	<TEXT> You are correct. Tradition says that St. Andrew, like his brother Simon Peter was crucified (Yes, Simon Peter and Andrew were brothers. If memory serves, Andrew was actually the first of the two to follow Jesus).

Additionally, like his brother, St. Andrew found himself unworthy, and requested to be crucified on a cross that was tilted to its side, in the shape of an X. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most people know that a "liger" is a hybrid cat, whose father was a lion and mother was a tigress. Ligers are huge, weighing up to a thousand pounds--this is due to their lack of a growth inhibitor, and posses both spots and stripes.

But other hybrids exist too.

"Tigons" are the offspring of a male tiger and a lioness. Unlike ligers, they do not grow to abnormally large sizes, and their coloration is considerably fainter.

"Leopons" are the offspring of male leopards and female lions. Considerably rarer than other hybrids, leptons have traits of both parents and there may be documented cases in the wild.

"Jaglions" are the offspring of male jaguars and female lions. These large cats possess the rosettes of the jaguar, and the tawny fur of a lioness. However, there does exist a melanistic jaglion, whose father was a black jaguar.

	<TEXT> "Meet the Coywolf" is a fantastic documentary, one of my favorites.

Ironically, it's actually a little dated now, given the most recent studies indicate that Eastern Wolves and Red Wolves are actually hybrids themselves, and not unique species. This in turn raises significant questions about the protections they're due under the Endangered Species Act.

	<TEXT> If two creatures can create viable offspring, they are not necessarily considered the same species. What matters is whether or not the offspring themselves can produce viable offspring.

Mules and hinnies, the offspring of horses and donkeys, cannot produce their own young.

http://www.grit.com/departments/why-are-mules-sterile-zm0z12jfznem

The different species of big cat can breed with each other, and produce offspring, and these offspring can produce their own young, but it is very rare, though not unheard of.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera_hybrid

Canis species on the other hand, are incredibly fertile. While gray wolves in western regions only seldom breed with coyotes, red wolves and eastern wolves will readily breed with coyotes, and the resulting hybrids can and will produce offspring.

The most recent studies actually indicate that most coyote populations east of the Mississippi River have large amounts of wolf DNA. 

And furthermore, domestic dogs are considered a subspecies of wolf. Their scientific name is *Canis lupus domestics.*

I looked up "Bigfoot" on Wikipedia because I was bored. So that got me to thinking about cryptids in general.

And then in ninth grade I started watching *MonsterQuest* and I liked it. And I saw a special on Travel Channel about Mothman and the Jersey Devil.

I liked the idea of monsters and mysterious animals.

So that started the initial idea. 

A group of cryptozoologists knew the animals were real and fought against evil ones.
It kind of spiraled out of control... </TEXT>

***********
1a There are no video games whatsoever in *Terra Xira,* though the notion of sports is not completely alien to Minotaurs or Wolfmen.

1b Video games are essentially virtual simulations. Lots of first-person shooters, in historical veins, but with heavy doses of propaganda. 

1c No video games. No electricity at all. But there are lots of physical sports and games. 

2a  7,000 years

2b The world itself is quite old, but the Machine Empire only came to power a few decades ago. It just came hard.

2c Nobody's really sure, since people have had shipwrecks and vanishings at sea since forever, so nobody's bothered to do any studies of the sort. Not that they have the technology to carbon-date anything either, but still. 

3a
There are six continents on *Terra Xira.* The largest is about the size of North and South America combined as one landmass. There are two continents the size of Antartica, though neither of them is icy. All three of the races mentioned throughout this post live the largest continents. 

3b
There are three continents in the world, but the technology is so throughly advanced, and the world is so connected that the very idea is a moot point. 

3c
There are no continents in the World of Oceans. There are many islands pocketed throughout the Oceans, but none of them are particularly large (The very, very, largest is about the size of Iceland). Just about everyone lives on the ships, though there are a few small settlements on a few of the larger islands.

4a
As the Minotaurs are highly militaristic, pottery is seen as not the best medium of making memorials of the battles and tournaments fought. Murals and mosaics and even statues are far more common, and even then these forms of art are not nearly as common as grandiose speeches and whatnot.

There's not much in the way for pottery for Wolfmen, due to a general lack of available soils. Art is primarily in the form of carvings, from bone.

Centaurs use pottery as a form of art, occasionally in abstract.

4b
Historical relics in museums, but that's about it. Pottery and sculpture are not priorities in the schools in the Machine Empire's world.

4c
Not much in the way of clay pottery, due to its fragility, but there are carvings of sea glass, driftwood, and coral.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It all boils down to "What can they do with it? Will there be any New?"  for me.

*Jungle Book* has gorgeous special effects, (though I was surprised by how similar it was to *Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story* which was a BAD live-action film from the 1990s)

*Maleficent* for better or worse is a retelling from the villain's perspective. YMMV, but it's different. 

*Cinderella* fleshes out the Prince. And gives a little mantra for Cinderella--"Be courageous, and kind."

You get the idea. 

Aladdin's humor is absurd and cartoony, but I actually think a live-action film in the Disney style could be like watching *The Princess Bride.* A live-action cartoon Aladdin could be great.

The real question is why the heck they're doing a live-action/photo-realistic CGI *Lion King.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1a.
Minotaurs and Wolfmen have fur, rather than hair. Fur only grows to a certain length, and then stops. They don't particularly have need for barbers, though Minotaurs sometimes adorn their horns for ceremonies, or else take steps to prevent their bangs from obstructing their vision.

Centaurs sometimes shave their heads in their quest to meet enlightenment. Others let their hair grow out continuously.

1b. Strict haircuts are set in place by government-trained barbers. Heavily regulated. Standards firm--men's hair is not to go past the earlobe. Women's hair is to not go past the underarm.

1c. Several ships have barbers of sorts, with razors made from coral. 

2a. Different races have different court customs. 

The Minotaurs resemble military tribunes, with the highest ranked Minotaur in the region presiding. 

Wolfmen are judged by a council of five. 

Centaurs discuss as an intellectual group. Interclan disputes are settled by a third party.

2b. Mass surveillance and an immensely powerful state has rendered courts meaningless. Trials are a formality.

2c. Jury trials of a sort. Three judges deliberate and a group of ten sailors decides the fate of the accused.

3a. Minotaurs have fairly traditional prisons, with cells and schedules. 

Wolfmen are imprisoned in caves. For severe offenses, such as murder, the pack will move on without the imprisoned. 

Centaurs reject government, so their form of a prison is generally banishment.

3b. Horrible camps, where the imprisoned are subjected to physical and psychological torture.

3c. What's a ship without a brig? The accused stay below deck, at lower-rations. 

4a. The enforcers are among the most respected of the population, due to their long terms of service in the military prior to their joining of the force.

The swiftest and most nimble hunters track criminals (of which there are relatively few) and are generally respected by the community. The strength of the pack comes from the family. 

Centaurs have no police force to speak of.

4b. Desperately feared. Intensely hated. Even accidentally striking an officer is a terrifying offense. 

4c. Due to the extremely close living quarters, a standing police force is relatively unnecessary. However, piracy is despised and dealt with on an as-needed basis.

5a. As I have mentioned, there are many races within the boundaries of this world. Minotaurs and wolfmen and centaurs exist. There are also satyrs and fauns, dragon-men, golems, Sasquatch and others.

5b. Due to a very powerful government, selective genetic engineering has eliminated variances in ethnicity and dialect.

5c. As the population is comprised of the crews of ships that vanished without a trace, there is a wide range of ethnicities present. Dialects have become fairly ubiquitous as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have several worlds. I'll add as much as I can.

1a. 

In the lands of *Terra Xira* there are a number of nations, each with their own form of government: 

The Minotaurs follow something of a monarchy, with feats of strength being ways to advance their power. Challenges and alliances are freely made.

Lycoans run on families and packs, however the mothers are the heads of the household, and the packs (which are made of several families) are led by matriarchs. (This is a nod to real-world wolf packs, where it is often the alpha female who is the dominant member)

Centaurs recognize no form of government. They operate together based on schools of thought. 

1b. The Machine Empire [once again, I'm working on the name] is the fascistic government of the Metal Lands. 

1c. In the World of the Waters, there are loosely organized governments. As the population lives entirely on ships and a few islands, there is little that needs to be done beyond Survival. 

2. 

2a. Different beings travel differently, as one might expect.

Minotaurs march. Not particularly fast, but they can travel without sleep for two days without getting ill. Incredible stamina.

Lycoans travel as a family, in caravans, and then setting up their group dens for months at a time.

2b. How don't people travel around, would be a better question.

Bullet trains, pod carts (kind of like large hamster balls, but radio-controlled), fire-boosted gliders, airships, hovercraft, teleportation devices.

2c. Ships. The entire population lives on ships, so they swim and sail.

3. 

3a 

The most "developed" of the examples I'm listing here, the Minotaurs have a currency system based on precious metals

The wolfmen are very insular, and each job is directly connected to each other. 

As communal vagabonds, centaurs rarely have a need for traditional forms of currency.

3b Currency is extremely restricted, with daily rations being allotted per household.

3c Not really. There's definitely barter, but for the most part, the people aren't really established enough to justify the use of a currency system

4. Languages are a bit tricky for me. I am not J.R.R. Tolkien. So...everybody more or less speaks English

5. 

5a Yes

5b Yes

5c Yes

6. Seeing as each of these worlds is actually set in the same universe (and yes, they'll eventually meet each other), one could make the argument that they're all aliens to each other. </TEXT>

Enjoy these facts on the lion.

**Lion** *Panthera leo*

Probably the most immediately recognizable of the big cats, lions live in the tropical grasslands of sub-Sahara Africa and in the Gir Forest of India, though they were once ranged throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. Curiously, there are still occasional sightings of surviving American lions--but that's a discussion for another day. (To say nothing of the debate among paleontologists about whether *Panthera Atrox* was actually more closely related to jaguars)

Lions live in prides, ranging in number from four or five to upwards of twenty. The prides are led by a small group of adult males, while the remaining females are almost all related to one another. Male cubs leave the pride when they reach maturity, while females stay with the pride their entire lives.

Lionesses generally do most of the hunting, though when pursuing larger, more powerful game such as giraffe or cape buffalo, males will assist. Lionesses hunt by ambush; a few will charge the prey towards pre-positioned hunting mates. Lions primarily hunt ungulates--primarily zebra and various species of antelope, including impala and wildebeest. Yes, wildebeest are a species of antelope.

Lions are among the larger of the big cats, surpassed only in size by Bengal and Siberian tigers, with fully mature males weighing up to five hundred pounds. Due to their size, lions are apex predators--upon maturity, they will not be hunted for food by other carnivores and their presence is vital to healthy ecosystems. Females are considerably smaller, weighing up to three hundred pounds, though it's rare that a male exceeds four hundred pounds.

Lions are not terribly long-lived. Because males are driven from the pride upon reaching maturity (usually after about two years), they must fend for themselves. Littermates have a tendency to stick together, but lions have high infant mortality rates. When an outsider male lion challenges the pride's male, it is not unheard of for the fight to go to the death. Furthermore, if the outsider male in the victor, he will kill any cubs of the dominant male he just ousted.

Despite their reputation, lions are not the fiercest of Africa's predators. A lone male can be driven off by traditionally-armed Masai warriors. Lions have an antagonistic relationship with hyenas, with both species frequently stealing kills from one another. </TEXT>

The ringleader of the mothers was killed by her boyfriend (who was not actually the father) when he "tried" to quiet her down.

	<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats and have lots of random facts about them.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

The five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well. Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers."

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism.

Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat and are actually somewhat smaller than their normal cousins. Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes. It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Outside of anecdotal reports, African lions do not appear to exhibit melanism. However, there is at least one, potentially, partially-melanistic individual that has a leg that is noticeably darker in color than the rest of its body.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs. When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

***********

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well.

	<TEXT> I think this is a fair question. I'm not quite as familiar with the Bible as I should be, but the general interpretation that I know is that the thief was genuine. 

Remember, Jesus was being crucified for being the Messiah, and if the thief was aware of the recent circumstances (the overturning of the tables in the Temple, the pardoning of Barbaras), he may have pieced together what might be happening.

This particular article is a good take on it:

http://www.jesus.org/death-and-resurrection/last-words/the-penitent-thief-a-model-of-true-repentance.html

And this one is a good writing on what to make of such scenarios in general.

	<TEXT> Personally, I think my favorite is possible the story of the Penitent Thief. Quite appropriate given that it's Easter.

In the Gospel According to Luke, when Jesus is crucified, he is placed between two thieves. One thief mocks him, but the other declares that their punishment is just, while Jesus has done no wrong. He looks to Jesus and asks "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've said it several times before, and I'll say it many more times again. 

When you raise the stakes too high, there cease to be stakes. Generally speaking, we know the good guys will win. The question is, how? And at what cost?

In regards to relatively small threats, Ant-Man does a good job. The bad guy is more or less an arms dealer, willing to take extremely dangerous technology and sell it to the highest bidder. The good guy doesn't have any particular personal involvement in the fight (at first--it's not until later that Scott's motivated to fight because his daughter's in danger, and also to avenge his pet bug) but falls into it more by chance. 

On the other hand, the Avengers had a world-enslaving invasion from aliens. Beating them was awesome, but what made it grand was the emotion behind it. Iron Man very nearly gave his life for the cause, and I don't think Tony thought he was coming back. Thor was desperate to get his brother back. And, as a whole, the Avengers came together.

Having said that, *Winter Soldier* and *Civil War* show this  </TEXT>

******************

Tall glass, three ice cubes, filled to the brim, no straw.

That was the exact way Lily liked to drink water. Cold and refreshing--and unlike a carton of ice cream, none of her little cousins she was babysitting would demand any. She could enjoy it all by herself.

Or at least, that's what was supposed to happen. 

There was a thumping upstairs. As if something was being moved...

"Henry!" Lily called. "Aunt Nadine isn't going to be happy that you aren't in bed! It's almost nine o'clock. Your bedtime was half an hour ago!"

There was no answer. Rolling her eyes, Lily walked upstairs. The hallway was dark, but there was light streaming out from one closed door.

Lily stomped over and yanked the door open. Her eight-year-old cousin, Henry, had dragged his toy chest across the room.

"Henry..."

"I saw that the Shadowman was going to get me. So I'm blocking the door so that he can't get me."

"Shadowman?"

"I closed my eyes and then there he was. He's this big evil monster dressed like a ninja. He's got teeth like a lion."

Lily felt her irritated expression soften. "Henry, you just had a bad dream. It's okay, I promise."

"But the Shadowman is big and tall and scary."

"He's not real, kiddo. I promise. And I'll keep you safe. If anything wants to get to you, he'll have to get through me." 

"Okay...."

"C'mon, let's get you back in bed."

Lily tucked the covers back around Henry and ruffled his hair, before turning out his light. 

Now that Henry was settled, Lily thought, as she walked back into the kitchen, she could enjoy her glass of water.

Her glass of water...it wasn't on the counter where she left it. It was on the edge, near the sink. And there was something else...

Lily walked on trembling legs over to the sink, her bare toes curling against the linoleum tiles. 

**The glass of water was half empty.** </TEXT>
