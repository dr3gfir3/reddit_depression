Abstract

 With the increasingly dominant role of smartphones in our lives, mobile health care systems integrating advanced point-of-care technologies to manage chronic diseases are gaining attention. Using a multidisciplinary design principle coupling electrical engineering, software development, and synthetic biology, we have engineered a technological infrastructure enabling the smartphone-assisted semiautomatic treatment of diabetes in mice. A custom-designed home server SmartController was programmed to process wireless signals, enabling a smartphone to regulate hormone production by optically engineered cells implanted in diabetic mice via a far-red light (FRL)responsive optogenetic interface. To develop this wireless controller network, we designed and implanted hydrogel capsules carrying both engineered cells and wirelessly powered FRL LEDs (light-emitting diodes). In vivo production of a short variant of human glucagon-like peptide 1 (shGLP-1) or mouse insulin by the engineered cells in the hydrogel could be remotely controlled by smartphone programs or a custom-engineered Bluetooth-active glucometer in a semiautomatic, glucose-dependent manner. By combining electronic devicegenerated digital signals with optogenetically engineered cells, this study provides a step toward translating cell-based therapies into the clinic. </TEXT>

BDNF Overexpression Prevents Cognitive Deficit Elicited by Adolescent Cannabis Exposure and Host Susceptibility Interaction. 

Human Molecular Genetics, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1093/hmg/ddx139

Link: https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddx139/3574683/BDNF-Overexpression-Prevents-Cognitive-Deficit?redirectedFrom=fulltext

Abstract

 Cannabis abuse in adolescence is associated with increased risk of psychotic disorders. -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) protein is a driver for major mental illness by influencing neurodevelopmental processes. Here, utilizing a unique mouse model based on host (DISC1) X environment (THC administration) interaction, we aimed at studying the pathobiological basis through which THC exposure elicits psychiatric manifestations. Wild-Type and dominant-negative-DISC1 (DN-DISC1) mice were injected with THC (10mg/kg) or vehicle for 10 days during mid-adolescence-equivalent period. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess exploratory activity (open field test, light-dark box test) and cognitive function (novel object recognition test). Electrophysiological effect of THC was evaluated using acute hippocampal slices, and hippocampal cannabinoid receptor type 1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels were measured. Our results indicate that THC exposure elicits deficits in exploratory activity and recognition memory, together with reduced short-term synaptic facilitation and loss of BDNF surge in the hippocampus of DN-DISC mice, but not in wild-type mice. Over-expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of THC-treated DN-DISC1 mice prevented the impairment in recognition memory. The results of this study imply that induction of BDNF following adolescence THC exposure may serve as a homeostatic response geared to maintain proper cognitive function against exogenous insult. The BDNF surge in response to THC is perturbed in the presence of mutant DISC1, suggesting DISC1 may be a useful probe to identify biological cascades involved in the neurochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral effects of cannabis related psychiatric manifestations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi fellow mods

We have now setup both a Slack and Discord mod chat channel, but we should really only need one.

Both have been integrated into Reddit - Slack has Google Calendar integration too, and I'm sure we can do the same with Discord.

Can you post as a comment whether you prefer Slack or Discord - just post the name (and if you want to, the reason for your preference). Once we know, we can shut one of them down and focus on the single channel.

UPDATE: Current tally:

Discord: 4
Slack: 4
Either: 3 </TEXT>

From the linked university press release article:

 Weathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plants leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs. </TEXT>

 Rule 11 - Titles should accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission.

 Rule 12 - Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content.

 Hi - the title is misleading as the patients are not "virus-free" but the virus is suppressed - please check the original sources that explains this. The Daily Mail, which is a British tabloid, is not a good source. Also, you used a Google cache URL link for your submission instead of the direct link to the article.

Artemisia annua dried leaf tablets treated malaria resistant to ACT and i.v. artesunate: case reports. 

Phytomedicine, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.phymed.2017.04.006

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711317300570?via%3Dihub

Abstract

Background
Dried leaf Artemisia annua (DLA) has shown efficacy against Plasmodium sp. in rodent studies and in small clinical trials. Rodent malaria also showed resiliency against the evolution of artemisinin drug resistance.

Purpose
This is a case report of a last resort treatment of patients with severe malaria who were responding neither to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) nor i.v. artesunate.

Study Design
Of many patients treated with ACTs and i.v. artesunate during the 6 mon study period, 18 did not respond and were subsequently treated with DLA Artemisia annua.

Methods
Patients were given a dose of 0.5 g DLA per os, twice daily for 5d. Total adult delivered dose of artemisinin was 55 mg. Dose was reduced for body weight under 30 kg. Clinical symptoms, e.g. fever, coma etc., and parasite levels in thick blood smears were tracked. Patients were declared cured and released from hospital when parasites were microscopically undetectable and clinical symptoms fully subsided.

Results
All patients were previously treated with Coartem provided through Sant Rurale (SANRU) and following the regimen prescribed by WHO. Of 18 ACT-resistant severe malaria cases compassionately treated with DLA, all fully recovered. Of the 18, this report details two pediatric cases.

Conclusions
Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged. </TEXT>

 Dried leaf Artemisia annua (DLA) has shown efficacy against Plasmodium sp. in rodent studies and in small clinical trials. Rodent malaria also showed resiliency against the evolution of artemisinin drug resistance.

 Purpose
 This is a case report of a last resort treatment of patients with severe malaria who were responding neither to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) nor i.v. artesunate.

 Study Design
 Of many patients treated with ACTs and i.v. artesunate during the 6 mon study period, 18 did not respond and were subsequently treated with DLA Artemisia annua.

 Methods
 Patients were given a dose of 0.5 g DLA per os, twice daily for 5d. Total adult delivered dose of artemisinin was 55 mg. Dose was reduced for body weight under 30 kg. Clinical symptoms, e.g. fever, coma etc., and parasite levels in thick blood smears were tracked. Patients were declared cured and released from hospital when parasites were microscopically undetectable and clinical symptoms fully subsided.

 Results
 All patients were previously treated with Coartem provided through Sant Rurale (SANRU) and following the regimen prescribed by WHO. Of 18 ACT-resistant severe malaria cases compassionately treated with DLA, all fully recovered. Of the 18, this report details two pediatric cases.

 Conclusions
 Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged.

EDIT:

For the commenters saying that this is not new because Artemisinin, the drug used in Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), is derived from Artemisia annua, the issue here is resistance to Artemisinin combination therapy, and the fact that the dried natural leaves of the Artemisia plant appear to have overcome this. 

This suggests that there may be something else in the natural leaves of the Artemisia plant that is more than just pure Artemisinin.

From the linked university press release article:

 Weathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plants leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs.

It's fascinating stuff.  </TEXT>
