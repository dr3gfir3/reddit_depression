	<TEXT> No offense, but I dont think the Texans are that high on Bill's threat meter. 

Edit: So you are telling me Bill is keeping an eye on the Texans because they might get a rookie QB in the draft that will lead them to a playoff push? Come on guys....Im not debating that the Texans are a good team, nor that the Texans are a team Bill knows he could face in the playoffs. I *am* saying that Bill is not motivated to do this for acquiring information, just that he knows the two teams and coaching staffs will put together some really good practices. I perhaps simply could have worked on my tone in my original comment, and for that, sorry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What? Its a Vita that can play on your TV for 20-30 bucks. I dont understand how you can give that a bad review. I own one. I bought it specifically for Cold Steel and have zero complaints about the decision. It also lets you remote play your PS4 if you have one.

If any reviews are bad they must be from when it was first released. It wouldnt be worth it if it was more expensive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man I am telling you, go play PPSSPP. It is 100% apparent at this point you have not. Its not standard, and like I said, many of them, like PSX, are garbage. PPSSPPs speedup is not a frameskip...its a speedup, the frams are still displayed (I believe). As I already said, its also very easy to use and implment into your control scheme. Go load up PPSSPP, take a lot at the options, then play a game and play around with the speedup. 

Then go use the speed up features of PS1 and PS2 and try to fuckin tell me they are the same.  </TEXT>

And yes you can enable frame skipping, but its not the same. Im getting the feeling you have never even played this on PPSSPP. And you dont think its slow grinding the money required for that glove? are you nuts? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently looked into wireless HDMI, and from what I saw, they seem to be far too unreliable.

I also was under the impression that the longer a HDMI cable goes, the weaker it becomes. 

I am unaware of other products out there that may help my situation or if my best bet would be to build a second, as cheap as possible pc capable only of streaming from a network, though honestly I have no experience in networking at all and it will be my first time setting one up despite using PCs since 95.

Any advice would be wonderful. I think about $400 is the max I have to spend on this project. 

More info if it helps: Two of the rooms are right next to each other, and cabling through that one wall is possible. The third room is downstairs of the other two, directly below. THE PC needs to be in one of the upstairs rooms. 

Thank you. 

edit: also should add that its OK if I only have one access point to the video files, I just want the ability to watch them in other rooms, if I have to start the video files in th PC room and watch them in another its NP.  </TEXT>

This does not = "ruined it". All you had to do was say you chose poor wording like 8 comments ago, but all you do is continue to try to justify it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. The police department making excuses for this guy is one of the more pathetic, and sadly, expected things I have ever seen. I get that he was being "pushed to his limits", but do they honestly think they are the only profession that has to deal with people treating them like shit? The kid was being an asshole. A total piece of shit. But he was not doing anything to threaten the officers physical safety. 

Police officers should be held to a HIGHER level of accountability to stay cool in situations like this....not lower. </TEXT>
