	<TEXT> Yeah, the country of Mongolia is another one of those fractured countries. Large swaths of Russia, all of the 'stans, Burma, Laos, vietnam and India were at one point part of one Chinese country or another. The issue is that Chinese seem to believe any territory that was ever conquered in Chinese history is rightfully theirs. </TEXT>

1950, Oct 7 1950 to be exact. 
Tibet was an independent country following the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, with limited international recognition, but including Britain. At the UN conference in 1945, China simply published a map claiming Tibet. In 1950, they marched in and took the country by force.  

The Moroccans effectively control most of the ground in Western Sahara, having marched in when the Spanish picked up and left, but the locals do not recognize their claim and have waged a low level insurgency for more than 30 years.

	<TEXT> This is the second post in the last week that I've seen that shows Morocco as consisting of the internationally recognized Morocco and Western Sahara formerly Spanish Sahara colony), minus what are apparently some areas in the eastern areas of the country controlled by the [Polisaro Liberation Front](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Western_sahara_map_showing_morocco_and_polisaro.gif). Google maps doesn't show Morocco extending over the territory. The [UN doesn't recognize their sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_status_of_Western_Sahara#Mauritania) of the area. I can't help but think theses posts that are ostensibly about a completely different topic are instead part of a disinformation campaign similar to China's taking over Tibet by publishing maps showing it as a part of their country, then simply moving in when at least a portion of the world started thinking it was a reality.

	<TEXT> There is a level of arbitraryness to the assignment of the regions. I am very surprised for example to see Tampa/St Pete all the way up to Jax shown as single region. Orlando and the Space Coast are a major commuting hub, separate for Tampa. There is also a lesser region of small cities to the north along the Ocala/Gainesvile/Lake City axis. This is only one example. There are also some strange counter mappings, such as in central / eastern washington were the Tricities and some unknown location/city are shown in separate colored region between Seattle / Spokane   / Portland regions. Chicago region is also strangely canted south with regions of the Chicago commuter rail lines shown to be in the Milwaukee region There is probably a lot of overlap there, but technically these regions should be shown with overlapping/transparent clouds so you could see the overlaps

	<TEXT> The blink circuit used in most cars depends on the line resistance to the bulbs. I know this from watching the timing of my blinker change when I connect and disconnect my boat trailer lights connector. In some cars, the timing of the blinker also changes pretty radically when one of the blinker bulbs burns out (front or back), giving you an audio indication that the light you can't see inside your car is burned out. In all likelihood, the timing of your blinker also changes slightly with the humidity, at least with older cars where the wire insulation has developed cracks. The resistance of the bulb also changes slightly as it ages. All of these factors conspire to ensure that even cars of the same model won't have exactly the same blinker timing.  </TEXT>

The crazy dude killing people doesn't necessarily relate to mental health either. There are a lot of people who equate rights of free speech and freedom of association with a right to be a hateful, resentful creep. The people who want to claim the problem with gun violence is really a mental health issue are usually in that camp, although more from a gun rights rather than a freedom of speech perspective. I often wonder whether they realize what they're saying --i.e., the mental health services of the country should be able to survey and predict criminal behavior in the population so it can be pre-emptively prevented?

He talked about some protestors that were picketing the base in the late 80's (when all the IRBM protests were going on in Europe). Anyway, the protestors covered their hands with superglue and glued **themselves** to things.  A bunch of them glued their hands to the posts on the gate at the base entrance. Others formed themselves into human knots, then glued their hands to the wrists and ankles of other people in the knot. This was kind of ingenious as they were in this huge pile of people blocking the road. The cops couldn't pull individual people out of the knot without ripping off their skin. The collection of people was too large to move all at once. My buddy got a day off work will they figured out how to get them apart and out of the road.

	<TEXT> This article does a really lousy job of explaining the link between reindeer die offs and global warming. The reddit title is even more obfuscating. While there is a link between the phenomenon, a climate skeptic could easily point to this reddit title with derision to claim climate change proponents are a bunch of sky is falling ninnies. After all, how could a lack of sea ice cause land animals to die?  

The actual causal chain looks like this: warmed arctic climate reduces sea ice -- open waters in Arctic Ocean transfer increased moisture to late fall frigid arctic winds -- moisture laden air dumps huge early season snowfalls in Siberia -- deep snow prevents reindeer from reaching forage vegetation -- reindeer herds starve.   

It is an example of the complexity of how global climate change effects will manifest themselves, and probably in ways most people don't intuitively expect. Posting a title claiming cause and effect without explaining it can give aid and comfort to an enemy that will exploit the claims based on a silliness factor and unbelieve-ability   </TEXT>

In the movies of Chuck Yeager's first supersonic flight there was very high turbulence just before breaking the sound barrier, then an abrupt cessation of the turbulence after the shock wave was established. Did you experience anything like that as a free falling body? Did you have any controls or devices to keep yourself from tumbling or losing control of your trajectory at the maximum speed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, no matter where you are, the moon orientation to the observer rotates 180 degrees from moonrise to moon set. In the northern hemisphere the full moon has the classic man-in-the-moon illusion at moonrise. At moonset it has rotated around and is much easier to see the Japanese cukture's crab-in-the-moon. However for me in North America it is exactly flipped over from this view, with the crabs claw arching over the top and the claw tips pointed at the horizon. I'm guessing this pic was taken at moonrise, so it is very interesting to me to see it both in "crab" like orientation BUT upside down from how I normally see it. I'm betting for Southern Hemisphere viewers, it also appears to rotate around in the opposite direction from what northern hemisphere viewers see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're discussing the projected sea level rise assuming we keep warming under 4C. The point of this paper was that the temperature rise is way more sensitive to CO2 rises that the IPCC concensus models have been predicting. Basically they're saying it may be double the warming, and typically such models are highly biased for much higher warming in the high latitudes. There's a lot of thermal inertia in the ice caps, but if they're having 90 degree days on the ice and the ocean at the ice margin is 70 degrees, a lot more of that ice is going to melt and move into the ocean than the ipcc projections. Current sea level rise projects are basically just steady state ocean thermal expansion combined with a steady state melting model. The problem is the possible or even probably nonlinear change when the dynamic equilibrium between the perched glacial pressure and the grounded glacial snouts. Think of that nanhattan sized collapse from last year multiplied by a thousand or a million. If that happens, the water could go up very high, very fast. The question is, is this increased sensitivity the kind of thing that could trigger it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While there is a need to increase sequestration to undo 200 years of industrial revolution, the more important thing to do is to stop extraction and conversion of fossil carbon into atmospheric co2. There is a natural process by which plankton form shells out of calcium and co2 then die, and drop their shells to the sea bottom. Similarly with algae. They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years. Then we dig/pump it out of the ground and dump millions of years worth of accumulated fossil carbon into the air in a matter of decades. There's only so much the biosphere can take up and sequester in the lithosphere. We really need to get our energy and concrete from carbon that's already mobile in the atmosphere and biosphere, not keep pulling it out of the lithosphere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While that is a true statement, temperature rises that high will cause increased melting of grounded ice shelves and above water glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. Without the grounded ice shelves holding them back, there is the possibility of a massive slide into the sea from west Antarctica, with sea level rises of 20-30 feet. These are already predicted to happen in 300-500 years anyway. Question is whether the increased warming predicted will accelerate these events to be occurring within current living and more importantly for banks and insurance companies, financial lifetimes </TEXT>

Given the accomplishments of the Caliphate, one would have expected them to advance technologically. One possible reason was the role authoritarianism in Islamic culture. The Caliphates never developed the scientific method, which itself requires postulating theories that may threaten what is "known" to be established scientific principle. In essence, the word and opinion of the authority became more important than the subject that they were an authority on.

	<TEXT> My basic argument as well - I think this was written by someone with a climate change skepticism bias with words intentionally chosen to be misunderstood and misquoted by the skeptic camp. More to the point, their use of the term does not appear to be borne out by the data. There may be an actual scientific effect to be studied --ie is the distance between to the peaks and the troughs of the seasonal sawtooth variation getting bigger as the overall CO2 concentration rises -- but the language used suggests this paper was instead intended to be a bogus scientific reference climate skeptics could cite to encourage doubt that atmospheric CO2 is still increasing.

	<TEXT> I feel the choice of the word "pause", as in the "pause in the growth rate", was made deliberately with the intention of making it seem as if the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere has flattened and stopped.  Technically it may not be inaccurate, but what is being described is the change in 2nd derivative --ie the CO2 increase has stopped accelerating year to year (perhaps); but overall CO2 accumulation is still going up year to year, not pausing.  A better description would be that the accumulation of atmospheric has stopped increasing exponentially. Even this is controversial statement as direct measurements don't appear to show any slowdow  

Annual accumulation rate as measured by NOAA at Mauna Kea  
http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2_data_mlo_anngr.png   

The so called "pause" would have to be pretty significant to zero out the accumulation rates going back 30 years

The cableless elevator is attempting fix this issue in the same way you would address the issue  in a transit system with limited numbers of tracks. First step is simply being able to have more than one train on the track at a time. Such elevators would be subject to same kinds of delays one sees in metro systems today - e.g. having to wait outside a station while the train in front of you loads and unloads. Or, having to wait on a line while a car coming in the opposite direction clears an area of shared track.  </TEXT>

The cable also has be able to be contained on a reel that fits within the limited space confines of the building core. The multiple constraint satisfaction equation brings it to about 800 feet. Many of those constraints don't apply to the ski lifts and gondola systems -i.e. they don't have to lift straight up and are less limited in the space for the supporting infrastructure.

Conceptually no different than a train unloading on one platform, driving down to the buffers, switch tracks, and reload people headed back downtown on the other platform.  Funny that you should have an issue with going sideways in an elevator. Most people would instead be terrified by riding in an elevator that doesn't have a cable holding it up. Instead it just has drive motors that pull it up or lower it down the shaft.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the factors is elevator technology. This is somewhat obsolete because some of the new buildings are using a new, cable-less elevator design, but a major limiting factor in the past has been the maximum length of elevator cables, which is on the order of 800 feet, and the size of the corresponding building core needed to house multiple tiers of elevators. Newer sky scrapers are using cable-less elevator that run one-way in the shaft, so you can have multiple cars in the same shaft at a time. At various points, the elevator shifts horizontally over to a down shaft.  
--- EDIT---  
I should state that this basically an economic limitation. The higher the building, the more lift capacity you need to get people up and down/to and from the usable space in the building. With cabled elevators, one elevator per shaft, this means more elevator shafts. These require space in the building core, leaving less room for actual "building". There is also the height limitation that means passengers have to get off at some midpoint and head over to a different bank of elevators. Toward the higher floors, you can have fewer elevators going up because a smaller percentage of the total number of people entering the building are going to the upper levels. The point is, the building has to pay for itself in service traffic. If you built a super tall building, the first 1000 or so feet of the building would have to be all elevators just to be able to move the number of required people for higher floors. Putting multiple elevators per shaft helps reduce that building core foot print, but it is still limiting factor, once you establish a base people moved per hour per shaft metric.
