	<TEXT> My evidence is my own experience. Have you ever had a dog being mad at you? I havent. But I sure as hell have had cat mad at me. Our family has had dogs and cats and dogs are very empathic like you said but cats can basicly give you silent treatment if you happened to buy the wrong kind of food for them. They also know when something is wrong with you same way as dogs. I think dogs just get more attached to humans than most cats.

This is purely based on my experience with these two animals. Is it right or wrong? That I can't say. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You shouldn't feel bad for copyright striking them if they don't stop using your footage. You are a content creator, you make living off it. If someone else steals it and it has effect on your work and income, you should take action. 

I know it might feel kinda weird since most of youtube community has very negative view on copyright striking, but in situations like this you need to remember you are a creator first, part of youtube community second. It should not be allowed to let other people steal your content.

Or at least this is my two cents on the matter. I hope this gets resolved in peacefull way and the people have enough respect for you to stop using the footage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cat's are funny like that. Some show alot of affection and some don't. When our familys cat got cancer, the last week for him he *never* left my moms side. And I mean never. If she went to the bathroom, our cat would scream outside the door if she didn't let him inside. The cat also slept every night with her and got pretty anxious when she was at work. 

My parents have one cat that always when I come to visit, the cat comes rub his head against my feet and hands the moment I sit on couch. While another cat runs away from me (until I start eating, then we are best friends). Cats have really unique personalities, even more so than dogs </TEXT>

Also why did he call the cops when his dog was playing with a sock. Dogs dig up all kinds of weird shit and he didn't know that Trish was gagged when she was raped so I why did he think it would be relevant? I don't know, maby too far fetched.

I just know it's not Leo or Aaron or the ex-husband. They are too obvious canditates. Way too shady fucks. And I think they are doing something else, running a drug ring or something but I kinda doubt its them (unless they all did it). It's gonna be someone on the side, kinda like on season one. Someone who has no obvious connection.

	<TEXT> Well in books the engravings are purely cosmetic. I don't think there is mentions of swords actually being enchanted. Like the tower and elvish script in Ciri's sword given to her by Bonhart and "Death to the motherfuckers" on Geralt's sihil he got from Zoltan. I think in the books only the metallurgy and smithing matters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're interested in doing PvE, check out [Azure, magica nighblade dps](http://alcasthq.com/eso-magicka-nightblade-build-pve/) by alcast. He is definetly one of the top players in the world, in the matter of fact he is in Hodor, *the* top PvE guild in the world. 

Also check out Gilliam The Rogue, he is a nightblade extraordinaire! He has a [veteran Maelstorm Arena build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppQXTVyQPk list=PLmTyEwTqDOgBMIdpxX5bL1UbRCVq1P5y4 index=3) which was made for the top solo content in mind. 

You won't be able to pull off 20k+ dps until you get more cp and better gear, but find a build you like and start using the rotation asap so once you have the required cp and gear, you are already comfortable with the rotation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pc's can do *so much more* than just gaming. 3D modeling, graphic design, music production, programming, photo/video editing etc. Not only are these fun things to do but some can even help you in real life. For example your job place needs a flyer for something? Just whip out some free graphic software or your adobe creative suite and suprise the people you work with! Pursue new hobbies like photography! Or maby even pursue new career on new field.

Also you can see if you can find some game that you enjoy. What types of games did you used to play? You might try out some online games and try to make new friends who enjoy gaming.

If you end up selling it I would say sell the tower in one piece, and then the monitor(s) separetly. That way you might make it even, or at least not too big lost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ATH-M50x are monitoring headphones and are very neutral. These are made for listening music so the sound is much more colored and bassy. Also IMO these are much more comfortable and way more portable.

If you are looking for headphones for listening music for fun, these would be better than m50x if in my opinion. But it depends on what kind of music you listen and what type of sound are you looking for </TEXT>

Mainly for convinience and I'm worried that after using on-ears for almost 2 years the in-ears will sound kinda meh. Anyone have experience with these two headphones? I really like the sound of my On-ear Momentums which is why I'm looking at the same  brand of earphones </TEXT>
