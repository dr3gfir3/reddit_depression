	<TEXT> Your skin is pretty much covered with very fine, often very sensitive hairs. When you hold an object close to your skin, you disturb these sensitive hairs even if you don't touch the skin itself. Hence the tickling feeling. It's basically like you're covered in extremely short whiskers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The finite amount of em spectrum available is not going to cause really huge problems any time soon (for existing uses) as the compression technology gets better. This is why we're replacing analog TV signals with digital - you can squeeze a hell of a lot more into the same space. There is also a technique called multiplexing ("muxing") which carries multiple channels in the same signal by ordering packets. Your tuner knows that when you're watching channel 1 it should only listen to packet numbers 1, 7, 13 etc on a 6-channel mux. This is how satellite TV has always worked. The issue is that currently things like 4k and 8k channels sometimes require more bandwidth than the current infrastructure can stuff into one mux, which is why players like Google are investing heavily in compression technology as well as fibre - a new compression codec is hugely cheaper to roll out than a new internet backbone or satellite/receiver network. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my favourite movie-going moments was while watching The Fellowship of the Ring in the Odeon Leicester Square (a really big auditorium) at the packed midnight showing on December 24th. When Aragorn beheaded the leader of the orcs, there audience went absolutely mental. Everyone was on their feet, screaming and shouting and punching the air. People were hugging. Shared moments like that are what make going to the cinema one of my favourite things to do.

Tangentially, we have an experiential cinema experience in London called Secret Cinema. It costs a fortune but you get really immersed in the movie - the staff are all actors in character and they recreate the whole environment. During their showing of The Shawshank Redemption (in a disused hospital made over as a 1920s prison), they passed out cold beers at the point in the movie where Andy wins his coworkers cold beers while retarring the roof. We were all in prison uniforms by this point and sat on folding chairs in the "prison gym" and suddenly, passing beers along the rows to one another, we stopped being individuals sitting in  a dark room watching a film, and started being a group of people sharing a moment together and - very effectively - with the characters on screen. It was one of the simplest and most powerful things I've ever experienced around film - a real moment of camaraderie, created out of very little, that really brought the film alive.

	<TEXT> This thread is about films that are supposed to be great, but that one finds dull. How can you throw around absolutists like "it's certainly not boring" when boringness is inherently a subjective assessment? You find the film as interesting as any other fictional biopic; this poster (and I) find it dull. Get off his case.

FWIW, I think Citizen Kane is a fantastic example of meticulous film-making and the detail of the mise-en-scene displayed is phenomenal. The psychological realism in the character of Kane is fully-rounded and explored in distinct and identifiable stages as the narrative progresses with little deviation from a very solid structure. In many ways and in a number of dimensions, Citizen Kane is an excellent example of a disciplined and structured approach to character study in film and it is rightly considered a classic.

But I still find it boring as hell to watch, and no matter how much you might disagree with me, I'm not wrong in that.

	<TEXT> They may not "say anything" but Bill Gold's original "cracked rock" poster for Alien is considered by many to be a design classic,  and it certainly did its job driving early audiences. I suppose real movie posters are marketing and these fan posters are art, but this particular one just annoys me - the facehugger wouldn't even fit through that hole!

I like these early designs more (from the book "Alien Vault" by Ian Nathan).

	<TEXT> "Stereotypic" is not a word; and "stereotypical" doesn't mean what I think you think it means. Try "iconic". In fact, I'd consider using "horn blasts" rather than "BWAAs" too (note, no apostrophes in plurals!) :) 

If I were to offer any other advice (beyond the need to italicise your titles) I'd suggest you maybe take out the ships' names from the Star Wars paragraph. It feels to me like you're just showing off your geek knowledge, and I'm not even sure the names are in the film, so they don't really count!

Otherwise, this is a very good piece - your passion comes through and you come across as bright and engaged. I was in a similar position to you when I was your age. I wrote 1000 words on the first two minutes of Blade Runner - it got me in because I was passionate and engaged, just like you. So I hope it works out for you too. 

Good luck and let us know how you get on!
