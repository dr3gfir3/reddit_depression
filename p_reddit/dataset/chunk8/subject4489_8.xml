	<TEXT> The message was seen everywhere, including social media. It started in my county. There were written messages that were put up everywhere. I read it and it freaked me out. I have posted it here. See for yourselves:

"It's Them. They're dangerous, unpredictable. I'm stranded here by myself. I need help. I have put this message up everywhere for my commander to see. In this place, this system called "uploading" grabs a lot of attention through views. Hopefully he will see this, and send assistance. It's like I am trapped in a cage, with no where else to go. It's a big world out here. I'm trying to stay out of sight, away from the creatures that roam this place. If I get caught, I'm in trouble. A whole lot of trouble. The towering structures cast shadows across the landscape. I walk endlessly through the paved paths. Luckily, I'm alone, for now.

It's getting dark, and I have nothing to sustain me. I'll have to venture out in order to survive. I am in an area that doesn't seem to host these creatures, probably because it's nighttime. The temperature dips below 35 degrees, and the wind starts picking up. I have adapted to some of these temperatures, so it doesn't affect me, too much. There are standing lights that navigate around these paths. The structures continue to rise in the moonlight. There are pictures of these creatures strewn across everywhere. Each creature looks different, and has different characteristics. I studied them carefully.

The first hint of light burst through the canopy of the greenery planted everywhere. For the most part, everything was peaceful. The temperature is over 60 degrees right now. The sky is a shade of orange and blue. The light burned my eyes, however the shade of the dark protected me. Suddenly, I heard noises. The creatures were coming out.

There are objects that these creatures use to get around. It made them move fast. Extraordinary. They communicated with each other, in a series if dialects that I now understand. There were creatures of different sizes big, and small. Everything seems alright, and peaceful, but I know better. These creatures can turn angry, and do disastrous things. They have strong military equipment. They can be deadly. That is why I have to take them out.

I am doing more research, commander. The creatures call themselves...humans. They are intelligent, two-legged organisms. They are situated all around this planet.  We have
 to do an all-out attack. This intelligent life should not be taken easily unlike the other planets we've taken over. I have learned their language, and will blend in with them. I will use the camouflage equipment to disguise myself as a "human." They will never find me, no matter how hard they try. I will find their weak points. Until my commander reaches here, I will have to be in hiding. If it comes to it, I will not go down without a fight! Be prepared humans! My commander is near." (End of Message)

I don't know if people will believe this. Is there an alien stalking us? Will they take over earth? There have been several cases of people  that are disappearing. Children are missing. Something big is coming and we have to be prepared. We have to be strong. When the time comes, we have to be ready, 'cause I'm not going down without a fight either.  </TEXT>
