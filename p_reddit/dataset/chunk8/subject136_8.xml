	<TEXT> I'm in marching band and I volunteer at the library. I'm bored because it's 8 on a school  night. I totally agree with you though. When you have time to sit around and do nothing but be anxious and hate everything its way easier to dig yourself into a hole. 

My therapy is a special kind called DBT. It focuses on meditation and being one with your body. It is the only kind of therapy that has helped me (despite my youth I have rotated through many therapies.) 

Thank you very much. </TEXT>
