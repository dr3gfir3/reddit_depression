	<TEXT> to begin, i have all the ORIGINAL QM guns EXCEPT the PROSPERITY. even have the mk2 versions of most of them, including string theory, wasteland, bosozuku and most of the common ones. anyways,  i plan on buying 5000 cp to get 2 chances at the triple play. now, im hearing that QM hacks are infact, NOT dupe protected as it says it is, is this true? does this goes for the mk2 hacks as well? IS THE TRIPLE PLAY NOT DUPE PROTECTED AS IT CLAIMS? should i take my $40 and go buy horizon zero dawn instead?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm mostly an S n D player, so usually tactical play is always a must. now my question is...if a player is in a room/spot aiming at a particular spot because he knows theres an enemy coming, mentally hes ready, trigger happy ready, just waiting...BUTTT the guy thats running into the room/spot with no idea what position the other guy is in, usually gets the kill. ...dont blame lag, ive been that dude ADSING many times at a corner knowing an enemy is coming, but the guy that turns the corner kills me first. 



doesnt this happen to u guys also? its weird...i feel like its a  momentum thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * Where my VERY FIRST match won't start because it kicks me out the lobby with error  rejected connection request 

* 50% of my post match lobby kicks me out with error
 could not migrate host. 

* after action medal report shows my total number of medals 
 instead of x medals earned in that match 

* partying up with friends makes everyone restart game every few matches because 
 the " lock " icon comes on and unable to find match even though I'm the party leader


* can't get 2xp right. It's always delayed 2-4 hours later. 

* quantity over quality.  600+ camos that's been ported/ripped from emblems. Its doesn't show properly. 

* the list goes on. Now, I'm primarily a ps4 user , But I DO feel for my Xbox and pc brothers. Its baffles me how a player that paid the same amount of money for a game ,not receive the support they deserve or still experiencing bugs and glitches that's been addressed on ps4 months ago. 

One last thing, the daily bonus for season pass holders. Why is it random? You have players get 40/40 salvage, 5/5 keys daily but other players are getting 30/120 keys, 30/30 keys. Why not have a set daily login bonus for everyone? 

Mon - 40/40 salvage

Tues - 80/80 salvage

Wed - 5/5 keys or 1/1 common

Thurs - 10 keys / 100 salvage

Friday - 30/30 keys

Sat - rare/rare drop

Sun - 30/120 keys 


Why not? That way it's fair for everyone.

	<TEXT> Well, it's not my GF. LOL

Been grinding for diamonds for AR's 2 weeks now. Finally got it just now. It was crazy because I only had the type 2 left for 20 triple kills and I needed 10 more. I got all 10 in 1 match and the game gave me like 31,000 xp because I also got my diamond camo. I had a few xp tokens on my account and decided to double up.

	<TITLE> Why doesn't obtaining a mark2 version automatically unlock it's prototype counterpart? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-14 16:42:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For example, I wanted to buy the R3kT , but I didn't unlock the legendary " gambit " variant, so I would need to spend 6k salvage. 2k for the legendary + 4k for R3kT. However, opening a supply drop got me the mark2 version of the " gambit, so I am able to save 2k and the r3kt automatically becomes available for just 4k salvage. ( even though the prototype gambit is still locked  for 2k salvage). So again, I have alot of epics I am able to buy for only 4k because I have the mark2 versions of the respective legendary. It should automatically unlock the prototype version. Who in their right mind would spend 2k salvage if they already have the epic version   mark2 version of the legendary ? No one. Another example of this is the kbar,  why not unlock the bunker buster if you GAVE everyone the same gun for Christmas with a different name? ( igloo buster ).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The daily bonus login system for season pass holders. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-10 18:48:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Why are season pass holders getting the same shitty bonus as non seasonpass holders? I mean I know technically we are getting twice as much as them, but if they are getting 40 salvage, why are we getting the same value? I mean come on, give them 40 give us 80. With a total of 120. If they are getting 1 common, give us the 1 common, but give the the SP holders a rare. If they are getting 30 keys, give us the daily bonus of 30 keys, but SP holders 60 with a total of 90. Dont just MATCH what you give them, give us our daily and it be 2x for season pass. I feel like people who buys/owns season don't get treated the way we use to anymore. It's not " exclusive " . We are paying alot ( I am personally a cod seasonpass holder veteran since mw3 ). Change up the system.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what I have.  I'm curious to know what you guys have. 
I also decided to share my mark2's as well. 

16 - epics
19 - mark2's 

Album: https://imgur.com/a/mzPNx

I'm not trying to show off or anything. Just also wanted to share the weapons I have in case anyone was interested. 3 months into the game, I want to know if anyone has gotten all or almost all the epics. And before someone comments and say " dude, where's the flatline" I don't have it. I don't want to buy it. That gun is SOO overused. I'd rather spend money on other weapons. I'm a hardcore S n D player and all I see is FLATLINES, i like to piss people off when I kill them with something other than the flatline. Maybe I'll get lucky and get it from a supplydrop or even the mark2 version , until then, I'll buy other epics. Thanks for reading.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Rare vs common - save your salvage   2xkeys </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-05 17:46:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Many times , I've seen people ask, should they open common or rare drops, which is better? I'm here to show you that opening Commons are a better bang for your buck. Why? Because the supply drop system is random. 30 keys for a rare only guarntees you a rare item which will most likely give you a calling card or taunts   gestures and a salvage bonus. With the introduction of 600+ items, common drops will almost always give you new calling cards or emblems and will occasionally every few drops give you weapons. When the new update came out, I opened up Commons only and was presently surprised by the amount of weapons I got. Now, even though they're offering 2xkeys, IW being Activisions puppets, DECREASED the drop rate for weapons , especially mark2's so that no one will have a high chance of getting good weapons. So I urge you to save your keys and salvage after this 2xkeys weekend has ended and the drop rate is normal. After, the 2xkeys went live, I've opened about 75 Commons and didn't get a single weapon or anything epic. With all the keys that you saved and everything's back to normal, before you spend your salvage on a weapon, you just might get lucky, and get a mark2 version of an epic you were going to craft anyway. So just sit tight and bank your 2xkeys. Here is some pics of weapons I got with common drops around a 3 week period before 2xkeys went live.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been posting for days about this error. No one would help me  and I know a few of you are experiencing this issue as well. After some extensive tinkering, i found a solution that worked for me and may work for you as well. Before I begin, i just want to mention that I did own the digital deluxe edition on ps4. 

* I tried rebuilding database. That didn't work. 
* I tried deleting and reinstalling the game. Didnt work. 

Here's what worked for me. 

* though, itl be frustrating for some, I re-initialized my ps4. 

Go to settings, all the way at the bottom " initialization ". 
Initialize ps4  Quick. 


This will delete data from system storage and restore ps4 to factory settings. Then just re-enter psn info and go to psn store and re-download IW and dlc1. Putting IW to dl, will automatically DL MWR, cancel/pause that for maximum download speed for IW. 

* SIDE NOTE: Use the PS+ CLOUD free backup before this process if you want your other content or game data saved. 


Thanks IW and Activision for not helping me.

	<TEXT> 35 hrs and still no fix. I have yet to play dlc1. These people posted only 1 tweet, 22 HRS AGO! 

HERE: https://imgur.com/RQ57bA4

They know only to come on reddit when people are praising them. I'm looking at you, Vulcan and Lee. But , won't come on to address obviously a big issue that's affecting many players. 

I've been getting this error since 12am Tuesday. 

Here: https://imgur.com/h8i1123

I bought the digital deluxe edition on ps4. I preloaded on Monday. 

35 hrs later, still can't play. But, what can I do? Nothing. They dont care about people like me or the community for that matter. They won't even tweet an ETA or some type of compensation for having us go through this. These people are criminals who take our money and shit on the little guys. Never again infinity ward,  never again. I honestly,  deep down from the bottom of my heart, hate you guys. Bye.  </TEXT>
