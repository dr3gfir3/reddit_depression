	<TEXT> First time stout brewer, looking for comments/advice. 

60 min boil, 3 gallon boil volume, 2.75 or so gallon batch?

Going to steep 0.5 lb flaked oat, 0.5 lb roasted barley, 0.5 lb American chocolate 

4.5 lb Dark LME

0.5 oz summit at 60 mins

0.25 oz fuggles at 30 mins

0.25 oz fuggles at 0 mins


Safale American Ale Yeast US-05

OG: 1.062

FG: 1.012

6.55% ABV

66 IBU and 40 SRM


I ferment in my basement at a steady 62 F and usually just use Poland Spring drinking water. I haven't messed around w my own water chemistry yet. I will probably add coffee to this. 

Is there a way I can get a higher FG for a thicker mouthfeel?

Brewers friend has the option to add a custom fermentable (fruit, coffee, etc) but it's asking for PPG and Lovibond values for the additive. Without going into too much detail any idea how I can calculate that if I plan to add either dry beans or cold brew?

Also, if I want a higher final gravity what's the best way to achieve that? I'm looking at an OG of 1.061 and final of 1.012. I'd prefer a little more body  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm almost ready to rack my NEIPA (LME recipe). We brewed on 1/21 and fermentation has visibly come to almost a stand still. Should I take gravity readings straight from the carboy w a siphon or can I transfer everything to my secondary/bottling bucket (with a spigot for ease of pouring) so that taking samples/hydro readings is easier?  My bottling bucket has a lid w a hole for an airlock, so if the gravity hasn't stabilized I can leave it in there I assume. 

Main concerns are oxidation.  

Also, once I have everything in secondary, I was planning to use a priming sugar calculator, dilute w a touch of water then mix it in w the beer before bottling.  Is that standard practice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all - going to be staying in Waterbury VT on Feb 3 and 4th to snowboard at Stowe.  I'd like to stop by Alchemist at some point but it likely wouldn't be until after the ski day....

What time do I need to get there to make sure I can pick up some Heady/Focal/whatever else is available that day?

Is that plausible or should I break up my ski day to hit the slopes in the morning, then Alchemist, then finish off the afternoon? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hollywood is the best bet for bigger games.  The 1/3 plays pretty large, and if the four card game is your flavor I have seen some insane shit in the 5/5 game.  ie) people cold calling 800 pre w J223o.

Ameristar is kinda dirty feeling and weak passive play everywhere.  Harrahs is more of a standard 1/2 or 1/3 I suppose.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My basic recipe- 2.5 gallon batch 60 min boil
Steeped 1/2 lb of flaked oak in 155 F water for 30 mins and removed bag. 

Added 2 gallon of water to the steep and brought to a boil. 

Removed heat and added my liquid yeast extract (about 5.05 lb of CBW Pilsen Light)

Add initial bittering hops 10 mins into boil (citra - 0.5 oz I thinkkk) 

Add hops w 10 mins remaining (.75 oz azacca, .75 oz mosaic, .5 oz Citra)

Chill to 180F

Add .75 azacca .75 mosaic .5 Citra 

Sit for 30 mins, remove hops, and chill to 80F. Add yeast (M36 Liberty Bell Ale dry yeast - 74 to 78% attenuation) 

Transfer to fermenter and top off to 2.75 gallons 

45 hours in I added a dry hop of 1.5 oz Citra, 1.5 oz azacca, 1.5 oz mosaic

I added the dry hop slightly after high krausen occurred. 

Now here's the tricky part... I didn't taking a starting gravity. I know I can just wait for the fermentation to be stable after 3 days, but how do I know what final gravity I should be aiming for? 

The color looks a tad dark but I think once all the trub settles it'll lighten up and probably still keep the hazy look.  </TEXT>
