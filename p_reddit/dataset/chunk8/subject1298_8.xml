	<TEXT> If one thing was done right in EA Battlefront, it was getting the *feel* of Star Wars over to the player. 

It's such a shame the game was so bare bones. Hopefully the additional development time will help Battlefront 2.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TBH the root of this problem has been caused by things like the Thalidomide disaster (yes I called it that) where a 'proven' medicine was later 'proven' to cause horrific defects in unborn children when a pregnant mother took the drug that was 'proven' to be safe for pregnant women.

Smoking was often touted as a medicinal health benefit for instance, and it's no good saying 'But look at what we know now!' because what we know in another 50 years may be different to what we know now and by that point it may be too late.

Just to be clear, I don't believe that vaccines cause autism etc, but you'd be a fool in todays day and age to trust everything you're told and not do your own research. For instances there is some slight controversy regarding the MMR vaccine in Britain that it may cause autism. After doing my own brief research online about it and speaking to doctors, the autism rate is far lower when the vaccines are applied separately and not in the single dose that the MMR is given as. I am happy because I have mitigated the small risk that there *may* be with the MMR vaccine, and my daughter is now immune. 

The Anti Vaxxers just don't get that the tools are at their fingertips to make an educated decision instead of a panicky frightened one.

The tone and quality is near identical, only the series story spans a far longer period. It's even produced by Spielberg and Tom Hanks.

And to iterate your point, Band of Brothers is still quite possibly the best piece of television ever made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On a side note, this is the fungus that the infection in The Last of Us is based on.

Yes, it is a very real thing that also changes the behavior of the animal it infects. While it may not cause humans to become zombies if we ever contract a strain of it, it changes animals behaviour to maximise subsequent infections, such as making ants climb plants over colonies to die so when the spores from the fungus is released it maximises the amount of ants it infects.

Yes, nature is  as fuck, but this fungus is the most  of all. How the fuck can a fungus do that??? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is difficult to answer because even at the final encounter in the guest house she appears as firstly a little girl then as an old lady. 

My head canon is that she doesn't choose to appear as a little girl during the bulk of the game to you as she's sizing you up. She's only heard of you from Mia and wants to see if you're daddy material. 

Anyway I'm missing the point of my reply, technically Ethan must have already been infected before actually entering the house, as the flashback near the end of the game showing how eve was controlling Mia during the opening of the game, and Ethan didn't see her the whole time she was there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reading through you're comments you are defined painting an unlikely picture. I just can't see a team of 32 pulling this off the way you're describing and having it be *good*. 

I hope I'm wrong because the glut of poor mmo's have stripped my enthusiasm for the genre, but some things *I* think you should take note of:

- Make a universe with minimal instant transportation. It really helps the sense of scale of it takes time to get places. WoW did this well with their flight paths in vanilla. 

- Encourage player interaction. Dungeon queues are handy and all that but having anything so instant really hurts the game imho. You could instead work the mechanic in where you could use a dungeon finder by finding a bar or tavern and not just being able to click a button on the UI. 

- Make crafting important. Even things as menial as food. Final Fantasy XV has a cooking mechanic where you get a buff. These buffs are huge though and make you want to have what equates to an additional 40% hp etc. Make armour and weapon crafters needed regularly by having *some* full loot pvp areas. You could have some sections of space as the 'outer rim' or something where there are no laws for instance where this could happen. 

- Don't be afraid to have same asymmetrical classes in your factions. It really helps with faction identity. For instance, the Draconis Combine could have a Dragoon tank class only found in that faction, while Greesian Alliance could have a Will-breaker debuffing healer. 

- Don't be scared of sticking to what works. Just do it better. The holy trinity for instance (tank, healer, dps) for PVE content works well, but maybe have it so these roles are exemplified in low scale pvp? I know companions have been done before, but a healer having a proper dps companion that they have to heal instead of dps'ing themselves, or a tank character having a support that needs to draw aggro from would help people learn their roles and be able to RP those styles when playing on their own. Also maybe have a choice for each faction of companions, but lock players to one where you can do quests for them and get to know them. 

Good luck, what you're doing sounds impressive but unlikely, and I hope you guys can pull it off. Does the project have a name so we can look out for it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New characters with older characters supporting. It's never as scary when your character has faced the monsters before. 

What I'd like to see as the next game is for your main character to wake up in a big house or complex with a bunch of strangers, and for it to be flooded with monsters periodically. It could be revealed that the place is a testing facility for new BOW's and the main character and he others are there to be killed so testing data on the capability of the BOW's can be aquired. 

You could work old characters into the game by having some of the survivors contact outside for help and then have Leon or Jill or someone as a playable heavily armed character near the end of the game to go in and clean up and rescue the surviving civilians.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an impossible conundrum where you can argue that a belief in science and a belief in god *in the purpose of creation* are exactly the same thing.

The big bang theory, is exactly that, we don't know for sure. It's assumed by scientific people who believe they've seen evidence of it in one form or another. The creation of the world as we know it by god was written in a book by a group of men inspired by another man who claimed to be the son/messenger of an alien. 

In both situations, none of us *know* for sure. I just wish people would respect other's choices in what they believe. Some people have a really condescending attitude to those of different faith (yes atheism is technically still faith that we are all a cosmic accident).

At the end the only thing we know that will ultimately bring joy to everyone is to abide by one rule: Don't be a dick.  </TEXT>

Refreshing to see this in context to Alien 3.

It's just that. An alright movie.

Back on topic though, I can understand why Fincher hates it so much. It is the poster child on why studios shouldn't meddle overly in movie production. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finished my first playthrough last night (on Normal) and played the game entirely in VR. I'll try and break my post into two elements, one for the game itself, the other for the VR seeing as a small number of people have the ability to use that at the moment. I'll also try to avoid spoilers as much as I can.

Firstly, I was really pleasantly surprised how good the game turned out to be. The demo (Beginning Hour) accurately showed how the majority of the game felt and the tension was present all the way through the game up to the final third when the game changes tempo. The presentation was brilliant, the sound design is probably the best i've seen in a recent game with random effects and doors closing nearby putting you on edge. It most definetly is Resident Evil too, with some fitting puzzles (they are pretty easy though) and a bit of campy dialogue here and there ("oh that's special" when seeing something really messed up).

The primary enemies were more interesting than I thought they would be, although I do feel they outstayed their welcome towards the end. All the enemies in the game save for the boss fights are one of three types of molded, and while the main type has a second variant, this one and the two remaining types of molded amount to about ten appearances throughout the entire game. That's one of the few things I felt was lacking from the game. 

The equipment on Normal was plentiful and to be honest while I felt I only had a little more than I needed while in the mansion, during the last third of the game you're given lots of ammo and a couple of new tools. One of those will instantly kill all of the basic molded save for one type in a single unit. The one that it doesn't kill instantly you can still despatch just as easily by predicting the very predicatble movement path of your pursuer and using a couple or three of these items. between these new items and the otherwise sudden abundance of ammo the game changed from a carefully constructed house of horrors into a mediocre run and gun action shooter. While I understand games may need a change of pace, they had the opportunity to do exactly this without altering the rest of the game during one of the flashbacks tapes but instead they give you lots of the new toys from the VHS when you return to the main game. It'd have been good if they'd have kept those for the VHS tape only.

The game left some unanswered questions (in a good way) and competently told it's story through files found around the game and some cutscenes for the main story beats. There were some contradictions though centering around some of the antagonists, and further to the ending which while I guess will be cleaned up in DLC, I think some of them (particularly the ending) may be best left till the next game.

Anyway, playing the game in VR was honestly one of the most spectacular things i've ever experienced and really elevated the game from a very good game, to and incredible one. The opening hour or so really felt amazing in VR and really showcased what a VR 'game' should feel like. It managed to really immerse you into the game without relying on motion control gimmicks (using the controller to turn items you were inspecting was a very nice touch though). I was *really* impressed with the amount of comfort controls available here too. I played the game with all the comfort controls turned off (incremental turns, reduced FOV when moving at high speed, no presence grid etc) and it was by far the best VR experience I've had. Aside from that me trying to eplain to you how good it is in VR is like trying to explain colour to a blind person. You have to try it to appreciate it. The closest I can say to it is instead of memorising a map in a game, I feel like I could walk around some part of the house now with my eyes closed. It feels like a real physical space i've walked through. 400 is a lot to pay for the game and the VR unit for PS4, but if you're flush with cash or in anyway interested in the tech, Resident Evil 7 VR is an incredible experience that anyone serious in games should try to catch at some point.

	<TEXT> If we are talking broadly as a series, then yeah, the very first one most definitely was scary. Not in an OH MY GOD THIS IS TERRIFYING way, but in an unnerving, hair on the back of your neck way. That largely has been down to two things: The first game was intriguing because it was a brand new franchise, and I was fascinated with the setting and when you first come across the odd thing that doesn't fit into the mansion, I then wanted to see how deep the rabbit hole went. The second was that i'd never played a game that had proper jump scares in it, and 16 year old me had just heard the game was a gory great game before buying it. Only Resi 2 has come close to this and 3 in a slightly different way with the nemesis.

Every other game since then (6 is the only one I haven't played) has felt more like an action movie. Enjoyable games sure, but not what I would call *horror* games.

7 to me now sits second to the original (I may have some rose tinted glasses here) in terms of being a horror game. The opening hour playing in VR is some of the most intense things i've ever felt playing a game, although I do feel that is partially down to the tech and feel it wouldn't have had as big an impact as if i'd played it on PC. It did return to the unknown events / setting that the first one had, but felt less and less like a horror game as it went on. Everything prior to the second Marge fight was 100% horror focused, but then as soon as we started talking about Lucas, the game changed again into an action thriller.

Nice topic for discussion too, don't ever feel bad posting stuff like this. </TEXT>

Exclusivity for a year is timed isn't it? And it also says that they would have paid a good sum of money to do it.

	<TEXT>  But its purpose isn't that. Its purpose is to ensure that our democratically elected legislature (parliament) agrees to what the executive (government) wants to do. That is a pretty damn standard check in any modern western democracy.

Your first point kinda also fights my answer to this one, but parliament had to agree to the government me request for the referendum. Having a second vote about the *outcome* of that just feels like a waste of time.

In any case we are in agreement that this whole thing is a shambles and that both campaigns did not relay anywhere near enough information.

When the minority has the power to change what the majority want to do, that is the very definition of the failure of this democracy. Sure parliament need to agree to this, but they already agreed to hold the referendum in the first place.

And Why assault the guy who is calmly stating his opinion. Anyway, ramming a flag repeatedly in his face is asking for a punch  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mechwarrior. Specifically mechwarrior 2, and mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries. 

Mechwarrior 3 and 4 were good but nowhere near as in depth as the first two home computer titles, and tbh this style of game would be perfect for a seated VR experience with a controller. 

I know there is a bit of a revival for Battletech and the developers of Mechwarrior online keep saying they are going to make a single player campaign for it, but I don't hold much hope of us getting the full sim treatment that was the first two games.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> UO in its heyday. 

The game appeared to have been far more complex than games being release even today, is never heard of it though until a couple of years after wow released.  


Either that, or SWG. I *love* Star Wars but I was worried about having a *subscription* for a video game. The thought of that was so alien to me, but now I wish game s had that model again.  </TEXT>
