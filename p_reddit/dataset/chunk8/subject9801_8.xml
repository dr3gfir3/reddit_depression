How does that make sense? 

And I get that their argument will be couched in the fact that Disney markets directly to children.... but Universal and Focus Features also make many, many movies geared for children audiences. 

The notion that BDSM and other taboo sex is tolerable....but a movie with gay characters is not? That's fucking absurd.  </TEXT>

**EDIT:** Not to mention the fact that these religious folks are ignoring the **bestiality** in the movie and hating on the gays.

Also, I'd like to point out that I don't have a problem with BDSM at all. The point I was trying to make is that religious folks take more offense to a gay character than taboo sex or bestiality in the film.

	<TITLE> I've made this point before, but it's worth repeating. Joseph Smith broke the very commandment he claimed God had revealed to him in D C 132. He married women who weren't virgins, and women who had already been married. That would be like if Monson drank Starbucks and Uchtdorf got gay married. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-04 20:21:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> D C 132:61 explicitly states: "And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthoodif any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else."

Problem being? Joseph married women who had been married previously and thus obviously weren't virgins. [Link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Joseph_Smith's_wives)

Also a fun fact, one of the wives, Zina D.H. Young,  married **both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.** [Link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina_D._H._Young)



Joseph claimed God had given him D C as divine revelation, but then him and Brigham Young both violated the commandment they claimed was from God. 

That would be like if Monson always had a full starbucks cup at General Conference and Uchtdorf brought his husband.... all while preaching against the evils of coffee and homosexuality.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the article: "But the church denies last weekends meeting came in response to any of that."

The church denies that Oaks talk/visit had anything to do with apostasy or combating critics of the church, then the power point confirms Oaks was there to "address apostasy."

	<TITLE> When Mormonleaks dropped docs about apostle pay rate, LD$ inc. didn't react. When they dropped docs about various budgets, no reaction. However, when they leaked a power point proving the church LIED about Oaks going to Idaho to combat apostasy, the church lawyers up. We caught them in a BIG LIE! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> There have been so many other docs that should have gotten under their skin and didn't. The church had been deceptive forever about apostles being paid, but even when that leaked, there was no real reaction from the church. 


However, when a **simple power-point** leaks proving that the church lied to members in regard to why Elder Oaks went to Idaho (**hint: it was because of widespread apostacy**), the church immediately threatens legal action and sends fancy letters from lawyers that are no doubt overpaid using tithing money. 

We caught them in a lie... a lie that apparently they think will hurt. 

Don't let anyone forget!

For the sake of being 100% clear, [HERE](http://kutv.com/news/local/lds-church-holds-special-meeting-to-denounce-false-prophet) is a link where church spokesman Eric Hawkins said, in no uncertain terms, that "Elder Oaks was not scheduled for an assignment that weekend so decided to use his free time to visit an area with a concentration of members, knowing that some members have questions from time to time that trouble them."

In the power point leak, it specifically says [Elder Oaks trip to Idaho **to address apostasy.**](http://imgur.com/a/c1Q8i)

Not at all! I get that all Christians believe a little different, but this seems to be a common occurrence in evangelical circles --- picking apart the bits they like about the OT, and ignoring the rest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a conversation with a believing friend that went a little something like this: 

Homosexuality is evil. It says so right there in Leviticus 18. 

Then, during another argument about immigration, I cited Leviticus 19, merely **one chapter later,** which says that you are to treat foreigners as your native born, and the same Christian told me "that's old testament, we don't have to follow that." 

I almost laughed. He literally told me that you don't have to follow the OT, after previously having a conversation about how gay people are supposed to follow the OT.  </TEXT>

For fucks sake, most mothers I know didn't even realize they were pregnant until 5-6 weeks! 

Accuse me of "lying" all you want, but banning abortion at 6 weeks is effectively a total ban on abortion.

I'd say the law of the land (deport all illegals, even nonviolent criminals with children) definitely conflicts with God's law of loving others as ourselves and treating foreigners as our "native-born."

	<TITLE> PSA to bathroom bill supporters: Which would be more odd for kids? A transwoman who looks and dresses like a woman using the ladies room? Or a transwoman who looks and dresses like a woman using the men's room simply because she still has dangly bits? I think the latter would be more awkward. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Do you really think bathroom bills are going to stop transfolks from pissing? 

Here's what will happen. When a nice transwoman wearing a pretty pink dress and lip stick is told she can't pee in the ladies room because that wasn't her birth gender, she will just use the men's room.... **with your boys.**

What do you think will be more confusing to children? Someone who looks and dresses like a woman using the ladies room? Or someone who looks and dresses like a woman using the men's room? 


Transpeople aren't going to stop pissing, and bills like this only make the situation more contentious and confusing. 

Also, quit acting like you give a fuck about the safety of women and children. If you did, you'd be banning sex offenders from the lavatory instead of innocent transpeople.  </TEXT>
