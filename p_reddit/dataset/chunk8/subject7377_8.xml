Once they have set that percentage then offline payments are invoiced at that percentage amount. Eg. if you receive a $1000 offline payment then if you have set your dana contribution to 5% you will get in invoice for $50. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First install tor using [these instructions](https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en).

Then edit /etc/tor/torrc to set it as a relay.

Here's a sample for you:

    ## Configuration file for a typical Tor user
    ## Last updated 12 September 2012 for Tor 0.2.4.3-alpha.
    ## (may or may not work for much older or much newer versions of Tor.)
    ##
    ## Lines that begin with "## " try to explain what's going on. Lines
    ## that begin with just "#" are disabled commands: you can enable them
    ## by removing the "#" symbol.
    ##
    ## See 'man tor', or https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html,
    ## for more options you can use in this file.
    ##
    ## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:
    ## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#torrc
    
    ## Tor opens a socks proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
    ## configure one below. Set "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
    ## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
    SocksPort 0 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
    #SocksPort 192.168.0.1:9100 # Bind to this address:port too.
    
    ## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
    ## First entry that matches wins. If no SocksPolicy is set, we accept
    ## all (and only) requests that reach a SocksPort. Untrusted users who
    ## can access your SocksPort may be able to learn about the connections
    ## you make.
    #SocksPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
    #SocksPolicy reject *
    
    ## Logs go to stdout at level "notice" unless redirected by something
    ## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
    ## you want.
    ##
    ## We advise using "notice" in most cases, since anything more verbose
    ## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
    ##
    ## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/notices.log
    Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
    ## Send every possible message to /var/log/tor/debug.log
    #Log debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
    ## Use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles
    #Log notice syslog
    ## To send all messages to stderr:
    #Log debug stderr
    
    ## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
    ## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line. This is ignored on Windows;
    ## see the FAQ entry if you want Tor to run as an NT service.
    RunAsDaemon 1
    
    ## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
    ## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
    DataDirectory /var/lib/tor
    
    ## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
    ## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
    #ControlPort 9051
    ## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
    ## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.
    #HashedControlPassword ################################
    #CookieAuthentication 1
    
    ############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###
    
    ## Once you have configured a hidden service, you can look at the
    ## contents of the file ".../hidden_service/hostname" for the address
    ## to tell people.
    ##
    ## HiddenServicePort x y:z says to redirect requests on port x to the
    ## address y:z.
    
    #HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
    #HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
    
    #HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/other_hidden_service/
    #HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
    #HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
    
    ################ This section is just for relays #####################
    #
    ## See https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay for details.
    
    ## Required: what port to advertise for incoming Tor connections.
    ORPort 443
    ## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
    ## ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), you can do it as
    ## follows.  You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
    ## yourself to make this work.
    #ORPort 443 NoListen
    #ORPort 127.0.0.1:9090 NoAdvertise
    
    ## The IP address or full DNS name for incoming connections to your
    ## relay. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
    #Address noname.example.com
    
    ## If you have multiple network interfaces, you can specify one for
    ## outgoing traffic to use.
    # OutboundBindAddress 10.0.0.5
    
    ## A handle for your relay, so people don't have to refer to it by key.
    Nickname giveagoodname
    
    ## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your
    ## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must
    ## be at least 20 KB.
    ## Note that units for these config options are bytes per second, not bits
    ## per second, and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10, 2^20, etc.
    RelayBandwidthRate 7500 KB  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
    RelayBandwidthBurst 15000 KB # But allow bursts up to 200KB/s (1600Kbps)
    
    ## Use these to restrict the maximum traffic per day, week, or month.
    ## Note that this threshold applies separately to sent and received bytes,
    ## not to their sum: setting "4 GB" may allow up to 8 GB total before
    ## hibernating.
    ##
    ## Set a maximum of 4 gigabytes each way per period.
    #AccountingMax 4000 GB
    ## Each period starts daily at midnight (AccountingMax is per day)
    #AccountingStart day 00:00
    ## Each period starts on the 3rd of the month at 15:00 (AccountingMax
    ## is per month)
    #AccountingStart month 1 15:00
    
    ## Contact info to be published in the directory, so we can contact you
    ## if your relay is misconfigured or something else goes wrong. Google
    ## indexes this, so spammers might also collect it.
    ## You might also include your PGP or GPG fingerprint if you have one:
    #ContactInfo 0xFFFFFFFF Random Person nobody AT example dot com
    
    ## Uncomment this to mirror directory information for others. Please do
    ## if you have enough bandwidth.
    DirPort 9030 # what port to advertise for directory connections
    ## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
    ## DirPort (e.g. to advertise 80 but bind to 9091), you can do it as
    ## follows.  below too. You'll need to do ipchains or other port
    ## forwarding yourself to make this work.
    #DirPort 80 NoListen
    #DirPort 127.0.0.1:9091 NoAdvertise
    ## Uncomment to return an arbitrary blob of html on your DirPort. Now you
    ## can explain what Tor is if anybody wonders why your IP address is
    ## contacting them. See contrib/tor-exit-notice.html in Tor's source
    ## distribution for a sample.
    DirPortFrontPage /etc/tor/tor-exit-notice.html
    
    ## Uncomment this if you run more than one Tor relay, and add the identity
    ## key fingerprint of each Tor relay you control, even if they're on
    ## different networks. You declare it here so Tor clients can avoid
    ## using more than one of your relays in a single circuit. See
    ## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#MultipleRelays
    ## However, you should never include a bridge's fingerprint here, as it would
    ## break its concealability and potentionally reveal its IP/TCP address.
    ## MyFamily node1,node2,etc
    
    ## A comma-separated list of exit policies. They're considered first
    ## to last, and the first match wins. If you want to _replace_
    ## the default exit policy, end this with either a reject *:* or an
    ## accept *:*. Otherwise, you're _augmenting_ (prepending to) the
    ## default exit policy. Leave commented to just use the default, which is
    ## described in the man page or at
    ## https://www.torproject.org/documentation.html
    ##
    ## Look at https://www.torproject.org/faq-abuse.html#TypicalAbuses
    ## for issues you might encounter if you use the default exit policy.
    ##
    ## If certain IPs and ports are blocked externally, e.g. by your firewall,
    ## you should update your exit policy to reflect this -- otherwise Tor
    ## users will be told that those destinations are down.
    ##
    ## For security, by default Tor rejects connections to private (local)
    ## networks, including to your public IP address. See the man page entry
    ## for ExitPolicyRejectPrivate if you want to allow "exit enclaving".
    ##
    #ExitPolicy accept *:53,reject *:* # allow irc ports but no more
    #ExitPolicy accept *:119 # accept nntp as well as default exit policy
    #ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowed
    
    ExitPolicy accept *:53
    ExitPolicy accept *:8333
    ExitPolicy accept *:9999
    ExitPolicy reject *:*
    ## allow DNS, Darkcoin,   Bitcoin but no more
    
    
    ## Bridge relays (or "bridges") are Tor relays that aren't listed in the
    ## main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even an
    ## ISP that filters connections to all the known Tor relays probably
    ## won't be able to block all the bridges. Also, websites won't treat you
    ## differently because they won't know you're running Tor. If you can
    ## be a real relay, please do; but if not, be a bridge!
    #BridgeRelay 1
    ## By default, Tor will advertise your bridge to users through various
    ## mechanisms like https://bridges.torproject.org/. If you want to run
    ## a private bridge, for example because you'll give out your bridge
    ## address manually to your friends, uncomment this line:
    #PublishServerDescriptor 0

Lastly enter _sudo service tor restart_ to restart your relay with the new settings. Check here in a day or so and search for your node name to confirm it's all up and running and relaying traffic. Can also check the logs at /var/log/tor.

Thanks for contributing! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Decide whether you want traditional road bike style or commuter hybrid. I would go with that latter unless you are itching for the former - you'll find it a bit more comfortable with a more upright riding position. Then be sure you get a good fit. Lastly, don't blow all your budget on the bike - use some of it to harden it against theft (replace quick release wheel and seat skewers with something that requires special tools) and a good lock, a light set, rack and panniers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The capital gains are calculated at points in which conversion to/from fiat occurs.

For example I buy stocks valued at $10kCAD with bitcoin. Later I sell those stocks and receive $20kCAD worth of bitcoin. I'm pretty sure that the capital gain isn't realized until I covert back to fiat and would thereby defer the declaration until that time.

	<TITLE> Adding "composite signatures" to Darkcoin for enhanced transaction privacy? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-02 21:11:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the 2014 edition of **Financial Cryptography and Data Security** the paper entitled ***"Increasing Anonymity in Bitcoin"*** (pg. 122-139) describes a technique called "*composite signatures*" that the authors claim would greatly increase the privacy of bitcoin transactions while adding very little bloat to the blockchain.

See: http://fc14.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/bitcoin14_submission_19.pdf

Since bitcoin is unlikely to add a privacy enhancement like this any time soon I'm curious if this community has considered this feature for darkcoin? </TEXT>

With electricity costs of $0.09kw/h it generates revenue of approximately $2/day while keeping the place at a comfortable temperature and requiring no other heaters unless the outside temperature drops below -5C. And that's with 12ft floor to ceiling windows along the whole south side.

	<TEXT> All of this is possible as part of the "pre-flight maintenance" while on the ground, no? Are there really still "strings" from the pilot area to the rudder trim anymore? Aren't all modern planes of this type now "fly by wire"? I happen to know someone who works as a sub-contractor for Boeing and he claims that they can log into the engines, while the plane is in flight, and make changes.

I'm genuinely just trying to understand what's possible... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technically fiat means "by decree" - usually of a sovereign power (ie. king, state, etc.) By that definition bitcoin is not fiat and that's the definition that you will see used most within the bitcoin community. However I suppose you could stretch fiat to mean "by the decree of mathematical proof" by which bitcoin would quality as fiat. Most bitcoiners don't use that definition but still happily believe that bitcoin is at the decree of math and phsyics.   </TEXT>
