	<TITLE> Ideas for giving a friend some money anonymously? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-05-03 17:33:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have a friend who is going through some really really hard times right now, but is too proud to ask for/accept help from any of his friends.  I was thinking of anonymously gifting him a little bit of cash (around $100) to help him through the next couple of weeks.  Any ideas on how to do this?

EDIT: Great ideas so far, keep them coming!

EDIT2:  I'm seriously confused as to who down votes legitimate questions like this...

EDIT3:  Thank you all for the ideas, there were a lot of great ones, and a few bad ones.  I've decided that I'll try just being straight up and talking to him about the gift. </TEXT>
