	<TEXT> Andrew zimmern went to this place in China, where they made world-famous fermented chili paste.

They basically just put it in enormous containers, no lid, exposed to the air, under the sunlight. And they just left it there fermenting for weeks at a time.

I know it sounds kind of gross, but that's how they do it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> was reading through the Wikipedia entry on cumin, found it interesting.

Growing up I always knew that it was a big part of modern Mexican cuisine, but it is native originally to Iran and then spread to Africa and Asia. Was not introduced to the New World until the Portuguese came.

Also, apparently, there are different grades of this spice. The best comes from Iran

The Greeks kept it in its own container on the table, much like we keep salt-and-pepper. So basically anytime your food tasted a little bit bland you would grab the cumin and shake away

biologically speaking, you will still get a significant boost in human growth hormone, and an uptick in autophagy (i.e. cellular cleanup in the body).

Mentally/spiritually, you will definitely benefit from this. After about 20 hours, you'll feel your mind clearing and meditation much easier. my recommendation is to Do a few one day fasts, and then consider going longer </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you feel stuck in your meditation practice then try fasting.

There is nothing in this world, no book, no expensive meditation retreat and/or seminar, no technique, no teacher, that will accelerate and transform your meditation practice like fasting.

before Jesus' public ministry began he fasted for 40 days and 40 nights in the desert.

The Buddha's major breakthrough came while sitting under the bodhi tree after a long fast.

Tibetan yogis, and Taoist masters, both teach you can only reach certain levels of enlightenment through the combination of fasting and meditation together.

Nothing will break down your ego, your psychological and emotional defenses, like going without food for an extended period of time. you want to see into your true nature? Stop eating for a while and do some serious meditation.

I am just coming off a three-day fast and every meditation session during that fast was more powerful and productive than the last.

stop looking for some meditation technique or trick, stop running after the latest fashionable book or teacher or what have you. Just do what every single spiritual master in the history of the earth has done Fast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was dragged kicking and screaming to the Great Wall, expecting nothing. In fact I expected it to be crappy. It got terrible reviews from critics, and even on rotten tomatoes The audience didn't seem very enthusiastic.

I have to say This was a fun movie! It's sort of reminded me of those old swashbucklers from the 1920s. They are cheesy, b grade, but still lots of fun with great action and even some semi-interesting characters

this sets of this movie are sweeping in scale, and at times absolutely  beautiful. the special effects are all on point. and the main character is seeking personal redemption.

Look, this is not the most original movie ever made. It's not going to win an Oscar. But if you're in a group with kids, teenagers, and adults, I think this movie would be a winner. Just about anybody can find something to enjoy

I'd rather watch this movie again than yet another freaking marvel superhero movie. </TEXT>

It's not "speaking wisdom"! He is a man in deep deep denial about the sexual trauma that he endured, and instead of dealing with it He has spent his adulthood lashing out at everybody and everything.

he is a mean-spirited, nasty, vindictive, hateful asshole while hiding under the mask of "come on guys! I'm just trolling! LOL!"

he never dealt with this festering issue, and now he's taking it out on the world. It's the exact OPPOSITE of the way to deal with this thing effectively.

Saying "going bankrupt is worse than being sexually assaulted as a child." is just another form of denial for him.

he is an extraordinarily damaged individual, who needs serious therapy, probably from one of those terrible, awful liberal" psychotherapists

	<TEXT> how can you say the show is crazy and extreme and really out there?

I found it to be fairly tame and quite frankly kind of annoying.

For those who don't know. It's about a guy who has paranoid schizophrenia But wait! Maybe he just has mental superpowers after all!

There's lots of scenes where, for instance, a dog is barking at him. So he looks at the dog all crazy with wild eyes. Then the dog is barking at him. So he looks at the dog all crazy. Then the dog is barking at him. So he looks at the dog all crazy.

same thing happened with a shot of a half opened closet door. I don't know what the purpose of this is, other than to show that he's kind of crazy, but it's really stupid and annoying.

Virtually all of the supporting cast is completely forgettable, with none of them having an actual personality or interesting quirk about them.

Aubrey plaza plays a crazy quirky wild girl Who really isn't that crazy or quirky. I mean, she did one thing which was to trade an old stove for some Drugs! Were talking about drugs here! Can you believe how crazy that is?

I don't know. I wasn't impressed, or even intrigued by this show. I don't think it's a bad show, it just does nothing for me

if you want to watch a crazy and wild show on FX, check out Tabboo. Now that's a legitimately wild show!

For the simple fact that the right-wingers are salivating over the notion of president Mike pence, the perfect combination of corporate and religious fascist.

That's been their end game this whole time. They knew they could throw Donald Trump to the wolves if things got bad, and then they can ride pence all the way home.

First of all I said it's the worst mistake in "modern American history". Modern American history does not include Stalin and Moa etc.

Secondly, America had no choice but to enter World War II. None. We were invaded and we had to defend ourselves. that's that.

We had EVERY choice when it came to Iraq. Invasion was something we absolutely did not need to do in any way shape or form. And yet we did. Based on lies told by a psychopath. And then we enacted policies that gave rise to Isis. Those are historical facts!

	<TEXT> the biggest mistake in Modern American history is the invasion of Iraq, and it's not even close. I really believe Americans VASTLY underestimate how devastating that was.

First off it is clear Cheney et al. were well aware Saddam Hussein was not a legitimate threat to the US. They were also well aware he didn't have active weapons of mass destruction, and were well aware, even if he did, he didn't intend to use them.

Despite this, they LIE America into a war. Think about that. They knowingly and willingly lied a nation into war that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and destabilized an entire region of the planet. That's not just a crime. It's one of the worst crimes I can imagine committing. It is absolutely unconscionable.

Then they invade. They allow the antiquities ministry to be looted, as well as other public buildings. The one ministry They defended with heavily armed troops? The oil ministry.

They kicked out all of Saddam's military infrastructure personnel. They had nowhere to go and nothing to do. So they joined up with wacko extremists and started Isis. That they stole a bunch of Humvees, cash, and millions of weapons from the Americans (conveniently just left them laying around Apparently), and voil! Suddenly a well armed, well-trained, fanatical fighting force was born called Isis. Thanks to very specific American policies.

But at least we rebuilt all of the infrastructure we destroyed when we invaded, right? Wrong. The entire rebuilding budget, hundreds of millions of dollars, was actually all stolen by defense contractors. There was no investigation. No scandal. They just stole it.

so now, Iraq lies in ruins, there is  (completely predictable!). Violence between Shiites and Sunnis,  and Isis is now spilling over the borders and destabilizing Syria and other countries. Because of all the destabilization millions of refugees flee and invade Europe.

This sets off the European Muslim refugee crisis, which is still roiling the continent today.

And again, it's just the gift that keeps on giving and giving and giving. 500,000 people died in the initial invasion of Iraq. An invasion based on lies told by a psychopath named Dick Cheney. 500,000 people all dead for no reason.

latest estimate is that the Afghanistan and Iraq war will cost the US upwards of $7 trillion. And yet we are told we can't afford health care for our citizens, nor can we afford a livable wage in this country. But we have $7 trillion spent on useless pointless tragic war that accomplishes absolutely nothing.

we freed them from Saddam Hussein, and we gave them Isis. You tell me which is worse?

it was, and still is a monstrous crime that we as Americans have committed, and continued to commit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> my good friend J. and I knew each other for a long time. Lots and lots of crazy adventures all across the country. Shared friends and shared weirdness for over two and a half decades.

Unfortunately, his behavior and mental health gradually got worse and worse. He started acting terribly, saying horribly abusive malicious hateful things. I would call him out on it, and then we would argue and argue and argue and yell at each other and scream at each other. it was exhausting.

Then he would be okay for a little bit. That he would start up with the really awful, horrible, hateful malicious crap again. I know it was a undiagnosed mental illness, most likely borderline personality disorder coupled with bipolar disorder. But he refused treatment.

Finally, for my own mental health I had to tell him to fuck off. It was 100% the right thing to do. There is no question about it.

But the thing is I miss him. He's the only person I talked to about certain things. I don't have many good friends, and losing one that I knew for that long, really hurts.

Tonight I really miss him. It sucks. Life sucks sometimes. I kind of want to call him, but there's no way in hell that is going to happen.

so the cephalopods gave humanity the gift of the universal language, with the understanding that in 3000 years humanity would return the favor by helping the cephalopods with Something.

But what exactly could the universal language be used for anyway?

So the language chick learned the language, and as a result could see the future. (Or could she already kind of see the future Before this?)

so does everybody who learns the universal language also get the gift of being able to see the future? no? Then what exactly were they going to with this universal language?

If nobody else gets the gift of being able to see the future when they learn the universal language Why does the language chick gain that ability?

Also Apparently at some point she tells her husband that their child is going to die of cancer. What the hell? Why would you do that?

If Jesus drank enough wine to be called a drunkard, pretty sure you can smoke marijuana.

	<TEXT> Google "Minocycline for Rheumatoid arthritis" by Carol Eustice

print off that article and get it to your doctor. Multiple people have been permanently healed from rheumatoid arthritis using the antibiotic minocycline. For some strange reason doctors are resistant to the idea that rheumatoid arthritis is actually caused by a bacteria (in this case Mycoplasma), however study after study shows this is probably the case.

also, minoycycline is very safe and usually extremely well tolerated this is not some kind of crazy extremists therapy or anything like that.

If your doctor won't prescribe mino, I personally would find one that's willing to do it. Good luck to you.

	<TEXT> first you have to realize that the people who are doing the symbols are well versed in occult symbology. This was demonstrated very clearly in that table of symbols and sigils.

Let's look at the opening graphic as it unfolds here. at exactly 3 seconds that graphic looks very very much like an eyeball. Now, a single eyeball is one of the most common occult symbols in existence. It is known by the eye of Horus, as well as many other names.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus

then at 4 seconds, it transforms into a triangle. A triangle and/or a pyramid is of course also one of the most common  occult symbols.

An eyeball + a triangle/pyramid combined create the eye of Providence, which you will recognize as being on all of the dollar bills.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence

So the intro in my view is a stylized graphic of the eye of Providence.

	<TEXT> there is no need to apologize, you are fine.

So here's the deal.When a person experiences something extremely traumatic sometimes the brain disassociates with itself. This is a protective mechanism. The brain creates an alternate persona that is more capable of dealing with the trauma and abuse than the dominant personality is.

This is probably why this other personality that comes out now and then is kind of an asshole. You created this personality, whether you consciously realize it or not, to be a protector. It's all a coping mechanism related to trauma and abuse.

The reality is this is probably not the first time this has happened to you, this is only the first time you become aware of it happening.

You need to find a psychotherapist who is well-versed in treating dissociative identity disorder (DID), this was formerly called multiple personality disorder. I realize you may not be able to afford it, but these type of therapists are very specialized. there's a  very good chance you can find one who will take on your case pro bono. I have a good feeling you can find one to help you

EDIT: one more quick thing. There are Internet support forums for people with DID. Talking to these people can help you realize you're not some kind of weirdo or freak, and other people are going through exactly what you're going through. They can also help you to find resources and suggest types of therapies that might help you. I'm sorry I can't give you direct links, but if you Google it I am sure you can find some.
