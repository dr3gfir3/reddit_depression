	<TEXT> 1. He was shot by Chewie's bow before the fight. (Remember the storm trooper that did a back flip from being hit by it)
2. He is not as powerful as we are led to believe in the first half. (Snoke even mentions right after the fight that it's time to finish his training.)
3. The Force literally Awakens in Rey. It takes control and forces her destiny. (It's the title of the movie.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, him being shot by Chewie's bow def made a difference. The main reason tho is that Kylo is not as powerful as he thinks or as we were led to believe the first half of the movie. Another reason could be Rey is simply the best we've ever seen at picking up on the force untrained. Anakin could sense the force as a small child before his training.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You were supposed to think Kylo was a badass until Rey beat him. He's not a badass...yet. He idolizes his grandfather, Vader which was a badass. Also he had taken a shot from Chewies bow, which was seen making storm troopers do back flips. I agree about the pacing.  </TEXT>
