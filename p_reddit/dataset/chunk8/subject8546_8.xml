Mice have excellent senses of direction, and even moving them some distance from your house isnt enough to get rid of them. [In experiments](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/1/99-0125_article), they find their way home quickly, even heading through obstacles to get back to their residences. The best way to permanently evict mice from your home, unfortunately, is to kill them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firth says its too early to tell whether vitamin B deficiency could play a role in causing schizophrenia. Large-scale studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency, particularly neonatally, in increased schizophrenia risk. However, there is insufficient evidence on B vitamins. There is currently very little knowledge about if and how B vitamin deficiencies increase schizophrenia risk, said Firth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The authors of the study reviewed a total of 18 clinical trials, examining a total of 832 patients receiving antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia. While vitamin C and zinc seemed effective in some single trials, B vitamins stood out as beneficial across multiple studies. Currently, only B vitamins have been found to be effective on a meta-analytic level."

This is a really good illustration of why meta-analysis is important and why single studies that haven't been replicated don't always mean much on their own. </TEXT>
