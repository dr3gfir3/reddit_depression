	<TEXT> Shit dude, even in plat games(not saying it's high elo but higher than most) people still flame for feeding. Especially if you're playing top lane and lose against a snowbally person and get camped it's rough. I just played a game last game where the support ali never initiated fights and i got super irritated with it and let him know, he told me that I was dumb cause I wasn't essentially carrying hard enough, I thought to myself "Jesus, I have to do everything myself." So I took two open inhibs while they seiged down t2 bottom turret all 5 and then we won the game afterwards. Even then though, the ali wasn't even a factor in that game and i'm sure all he wanted to do was keep his kda positive. Stuff like that makes me mad where people expect you to do everything for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assholes that make a comment on every small mistake you make. Or spam ping you because you said something in retaliation so you're the target of their tilted harassment. Even if the person getting harassed IS doing something wrong, but putting in an effort, it doesn't mean that the person harassing that person isn't guilty of bad mistakes as well. Like if the harasser is the jungler who just died at baron and their whole team is going to do it while everyone is based, why is the jungler getting mad at the team when he's the one caused the situation in the first place? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quit stirring the pot obama. Clinton lost deal with it and move on. Who gives a fuck. Russia aint tripping over U.S spying on Putin and Obama wants to do something about an election? How about invade Mexico and stop the drug cartel and stop those psychopaths from poisoning the world and decapitating and torturing innocent citizens of Mexico. Use the tax payers dollars for something useful rather than this insignificant petty cry baby bullshit.
