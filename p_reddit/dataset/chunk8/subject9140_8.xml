What is the point of having a gun that isn't loaded?

I understand what the laws are trying to accomplish re: safe handling of weapons/not being intoxicated with one BUT that kind of ignores logic.

If you have a gun with you, then it's probably loaded.

	<TEXT> I'm not an introvert but I like my haircut silence.

Easiest way in my opinion:

1) stare straight ahead 

2) very short answers

3) don't ask them the same question 

E.g. If they ask your plans for the weekend.

You: "not sure"

DO NOT ASK THEIR PLANS. IT'S A PLOY FOR A CONVERSATION. NOT SURE GIVES THEM NOTHING TO WORK WITH AT ALL.

After two or three of those, they get the hint.

	<TEXT> The fallout of the civil war has never been fully resolved.

Despite emancipation in 1865, laws were in place for a full century that kept whites and blacks "separate, but equal"

Even now the disenfranchisement of African Americans is a goal of one party in the United States to keep this the case.

The racial challenges the rest of the world sees today are due to structural forces that keep minorities, and especially African Americans, at a disadvantage.

Homogeneity is such a given in so many countries, I feel like this would be hard to understand.

I buy way fewer games simply because 1 player/campaign/story mode is ignored in favor of multiplayer.

	<TEXT> To explain like you're 5, people on Wall Street primarily;

Help raise money for new(er) companies (investment banking)

Help existing companies increase value for all owners, including the regular person, in secondary market (the stock market as most people know it)

Help you manage your money (wealth management and financial advice)

Help entities/individuals/states/counties manage risk and exposure (derivatives and synthetic products)

Help entities/states/countries raise money they need in exchange for future payments to those that loaned them money (fixed income and debt issuances)

Help provide liquidity to banks that want to make loans to regular people (The Fed and institutional lending)

Insure the money of bank deposits and brokerage accounts (FDIC and SIPC)

Oversee financial firms to ensure they don't screw over customers and comply with law (SEC, FINRA, OCC, FSA etc)

Make it possible for financial transactions to be completed or "settle" (DTC, NSCC, Euroclear, CREST, etc)

Move money around the globe (Fed Wires, ACH etc. Most Wall Street firms are banks as well)

**This is a gross oversimplification but covers the majority of what people in the industry do**

A replica ornamental dagger from "The Scorpion King" under my bed should they overpower me and force me the floor. ( a gift from my parents..:NO I DON'T KNOW WHY...STOP JUDGING LOL)

Why not a gun you ask...I really don't have an answer for that. I'm not against guns, per se, but I've never needed any of the above. A gun feels like overkill despite my clear paranoia re: my safety. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh no! The Trump administration lies and is unethical!

What'll we do!?

Update: we've known this fact for over a fucking year and no one who likes him cares.

Until we get a POV video of:

President Shitgibbon directing 2 Russian escorts 

To piss on each other in a bed at The Four Seasons in Moscow

And then saying "Yeah, piss on that bed Obama slept in. I don't care if he produced his long form birth certificate"

And then turning the camera to his face and saying "I'm Donald Trump and I approved this message because that's what I think of Democracy"

No one other than his critics will care.

Pardon me while I go get drunk and unpack the truth in that very depressing statement.
