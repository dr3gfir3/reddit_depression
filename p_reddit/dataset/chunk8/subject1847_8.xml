	<TEXT> Well, for the majority it was simply me catching them in my lake and moving them to the swim pond.

The exception is the grass carp.  They are regulated by the state as an invasive species so you have to get certified triploid carp that can't breed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No.  Since it is a submersible you just need to make sure that the entire pump housing stays submerged.

Is I showed in one picture I initially had the cistern dammed up a bit and that was restricting the water flow too much.  I just removed some of the dam to ensure enough water could flow to the cistern and it works like a champ. </TEXT>

No those aren't heat treated and to me that's just one more crazy thing they want to sell you.  These are standard, cheap landscaping blocks from Home Depot.  

We have a fire almost every night.  I did our last firepit out of them also and they lasted for years.  Whenever one gets cracked or broken (from fire or other wear-n-tear) just throw that one out and put a new one in it's place in two minutes. </TEXT>

I love snakes and have no problems with them.  They are *always* more afraid of you than you are of them.

Even the rattlers here are pretty chill. </TEXT>

This cost me total about $30k and that is including things that I really could separate out (like the deep well that was 5k.  We would have added it anyway for a backup to our existing well). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) I have put in a deep-well - 425 feet.  Not only does this service the pond but provided a secondary well to service the house in case we ever have an issue with the primary well.

2) First, do the excavation yourself.  Now that I tried and (and liked it!) I rent an excavator every few months when I have thought of enough uses for the weekend).  I would *not* have tried the pumping design without finding a human to talk to or email with.  I just didn't understand some basics and didn't get any hints from the online sources I used.  Had I had a /r/DIYdiaries to consult with and get advice I might have skipped a lot of $$ and headaches. </TEXT>

I started out looking to build a traditional "hobbit house".  The more I have gotten into it I've taken to calling it a "beaver lodge".

It is underground - cut into the side of a hill overlooking our active beaver pond.   But it won't have an earthen roof.  

I'm actually planning to do a Tesla powerwall and *hopefully* (if availability/timing works) go with Tesla solar shingles on the south facing side so it can be off grid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife says my projects just grow each time.

At our last property I did my first farm pond which was "meh" and a little koi pond.  That's what this is most like - just kind of supersized.

Really the key to clear water is just keeping it active and ensuring there is no "run-in" where dirt can make it back into the water.

And realize that at different times of the year it will be clearer than others. </TEXT>

- Deep well drilled and pump installed = 5k

The cost is all in the natural materials so if you have access to cheap river rocks and sand you could probably knock 15k off of that.

	<TEXT> One of the great things about not living in a city or the suburbs anymore.

We have no permitting at all out here. 

We are actually in the process of building 4 additional "staycation" homes on the property - a house on our lake, a hobbit house overlooking our beaver pond, a "tree house" that overlooks a natural waterfall with rocks as large as semis, and a caretaker cabin.  Also mid-build on new stables (that old white barn was just a fixer-upper until I could build what my wife really wanted).

The plan is to market to the Atlanta area as a weekend getaway - bring your horses (six miles of trails!) and fishing pole.  Pick one of the unique house you want to stay in and enjoy your stay.

We'll see how that works out. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See, that's the problem right there.

People are happy to spend 30k on an inground pool and finance it into their mortgage.  They'll do that in a minute.

But this effectively cost me less than $1,000 a month over three years.  Sure it was usually in larger slugs but when I had some free cash flow I would buy a load or two of stones and have another month or so of work.  

In our "McDonald's Era" of immediate gratification people just aren't willing to wait 3 years to have something.

I've found that the journey to build something is just as (and sometimes more) gratifying as enjoying the end result. </TEXT>

Over time I can easily cull if I get some breeders and I move those back down to the large lake. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure exactly what you mean.  Microbes like "flesh-eating bacteria" type stuff?

Honestly - active moving water - with a natural ecosystem is not exactly the place I would worry about dangerous microbes. 

I (and a lot of others) grew up swimming in ponds and creeks.  While sure there are dangerous things (big and small) in nature they are the exception not the rule.  But then you only read about the scary things that happen infrequently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL.  Well what I find is the more sources I look at, the more questions that I ask - the more I settle in on a solution I can live.  You are never going to make all the people happy all of the time. :)

I can honestly say that every one of my DIY projects has at some point been denigrated by someone that absolutely *knows* the way I did something is wrong.

That said, there are some great responses that have caused me to go back and change something (like my LED light eaves that should have had external outlets instead of running into the attic - that one made sense so I changed it). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish.  I realize the mods have to set rules to maintain some form of order but it seems like they could just add flair for finished project or "in progress".

I do some pretty big DIY projects and I usually have no idea what I am doing.  I just google, youtube, and read.  It still doesn't fill the void of being able to ask questions interactively in comments.

There are a lot of (expensive) mistakes that I make that I would LOVE to ask the community for ideas/thoughts/direction BEFORE I screw it up but sadly there isn't.

That said I will say that I find /r/homeimprovement and /r/woodworking have very active helpful communities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Live in the country on several hundred acres.  

For a long time I kept "waiting" thinking I wanted to buy a large tractor combo with all the implements.  

If finally broke down and figured why not get a skid steer first because much of what I need to do it could handle and I already have a neighbor that will bushhog for me.

So I started watching Craigslist and very quickly found a perfect fit - a New Holland LS170.  I bought it from a guy that owns a landscaping company.  It was used mostly on site to do a little grading and then to fork in the pallets of stone needed for the job.  The skidsteer only had about 700 hours on it.

I got the skidsteer plus the a transport trailer for $12,000 which was WAY less than I was expecting to pay.  I absolutely love it.  Small, doesn't take up much space - but literally does everything I need it to do.

I don't know your exact situation but I can't say enough great things about having a skidsteer.  It's saved my back a million times and I'm always inventing new ways to use it. </TEXT>
