	<TEXT> Thank you for the in-depth reply.

OK, but case in point: burster.

Where do I read what a burster can damage?

Flak damages everything in the air, but nothing on the ground?  Except infantry?  Wait, it also damages harassers but not lightning on up?

I love sunderers, but I'm pretty sure a kobalt killed one of my sunderers.  Is a sunderer heavy or light?  What does a kobalt do to a MAX?  MAXes are a great illustration of the mystery I experience in knowing what is useful to hit them with or whether to ignore them.  My guess is that a MAX with kinetic armor doesn't care about a kobalt, but if I fire on a kinetic-armored MAX with a Ranger, he takes damage, right?  I would assume he does because he's not wearing flak armor.

I know I'm talking a lot about flak, but the Walker is equally confusing to me.  Again, it will shred any air vehicle but not any ground vehicle?  Walker v MAX?  Kinetic v Flak?

Do you see what I mean about wishing for a table?

I think there's a basic rule that works overall until you get to anti-air weaponry v ground targets.  I also see this with the turrets on facilities.  Again, you can hop in an anti-air turret and pound away at air targets.  While there are no air targets, you're free to take pot shots at infantry.  But sunderers?  I think no.  Tanks? No.  Flashes and Harassers?  Yes?  I'm not sure.

I always run a sundie with a basilisk on front simply because I know it damages everything.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a broader sense, is it not true for all of us in our own families that 70-year-olds are people who we need to take care of?  I mean, in general, are they not past their prime as family leaders and more the retired family leader?

If that's true for our families, why are we electing 70-year-olds to run the country?

Trump would be past mandatory retirement age if he were a civil servant.

He's calling Paul Ryan Ron and forgetting 90% of what he's said previously.

It's like dealing with my grandfather.  Oh, you always wanted to go sailing?  OK, let's do it!  Woohoo!

In this case, it's "You always wanted to be president?"  OK, you did it!  Woohoo!  Now what?  And then Gramps says "mission accomplished!  Let's hit the links..."

And then, it gets scarier.  I always wanted to run a war...

And let's remember: Reagan wanted to overturn rules so he could have a third term while he was completely out of it.

Personality disorder is one thing, but he's also suffering from a serious case of the natural and inevitable mental decay that happens when you're 70.

Let's not elect ancient grandpas.  Period.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm sadly and too often firing burster/ranger on air that sometimes turns out to be friendly...

But I seem to find it incredibly forgiving.  Given that flak explodes near targets, does our Planetside world have advanced flak that only detonates near enemy targets?

And while I'm at it, is there a wiki or some such that lists out what weapons affect what enemies?  You get the regular tip that small arms fire affects light vehicles, but in-game you also show red hits on things whether you damage them or not.

Running around, I've shot infantry with a burster (headshot even, I believe), but are MAXes immune to flak?  And along those lines, rather than read all of the weapon descriptions (especially vehicle weaponry), can I just read a table somewhere that shows what damages what? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Essentially, yes, that is one possibility.

Things are so far skewed from having this situation for over a hundred years that you would definitely not just suddenly inject 1000 new reps into the system, but that doesn't mean we do something more sane and moderate but better than one per 750k.

And then we have the party argument which is very much a parallel to the "we can't get rid of the electoral college" argument.  This is far easier to change than the electoral college, and if people give a crap about removing the apportionment act, then it becomes an issue.

Almost any talk about how to fix our government, including everything in this article, can be countered by "but the two parties won't support that" argument.

We've had decades of "the electoral college will never be removed", but as of this election, you have a seriously significant number of people who are ready to push for its removal.

Really, right now the biggest problem with canceling the apportionment act is that almost no one even knows about it.

So I emplore you: Decide for yourself whether it's a good idea or not (it's a bipartisan issue) and, rather than saying it will never happen, tell people about it.

	<TEXT> I've lived in both China and South Korea (as well as Taiwan, for that matter), so let me try to answer your question, which is a very complicated one.

In the world of communism, China is Maoist whereas North Korea is Stalinist.  There is and always has been a serious divide between these two schools.  China didn't get along with the Soviet Union despite being communist, North Korea was closer aligned with the Soviets than China, and China got involved in the Korean War more as a defensive measure on their own part than to save North Korea (MacArthur is to blame for their participation, but that's another story).

As such, despite what many people far removed might think, China isn't exactly happy about having their crazy neighbor, and Chinese look down on North Korea in much the same way the West does.

Do they want a united Korea?  As much as I know, I couldn't definitively answer that question.  They would be none too happy about US forces stationed in a united Korea, but they would also stand to benefit in the long term if Korea followed the path of Germany after it was reunified, meaning a long tough term for South Korea (that actually many in SK oppose because of the economic hardship involved) that would ultimately result in a powerful trade partner minus the poor economic migrants they have to deal with now fleeing North Korea as they have done for generations.

In our contemporary perspective, people like to dwell on the nuclear threat of North Korea, but the fact is that North Korea didn't get invaded and overthrown for a good 50 years before they had nukes.

So, why didn't someone just invade them a long time ago?

a) You have wider geopolitical tensions than just Korea.  You're in the backyard of both China and Russia.

b) If you look at a map, South Korea's capital, Seoul, is pretty much on the border with North Korea.  It has close to 20 million people living in the shadow of North Korea.  North Korea has thousands, more like tens of thousands, of artillery pointed at every single square inch of Seoul.  Soldiers and expats have nicknamed it the Kill Box because you're pretty much dead if you're in the Kill Box when war breaks out.

So, when you talk about the result of overthrowing Kim Jong Un, the first result that comes to question is who and how many people will die in the process.

NK would probably mercilessly strike Seoul if they were attacked, and it is highly questionable as to whether US forces or otherwise would be able to act so swiftly that they could prevent this.  People like to dream of the last war, and Seoul is not Baghdad.  Things will not play out the same as when Saddam's troops dropped everything and fled.  Don't get me wrong, NK troops might do that, but will they do that before they fire all of the artillery that's sitting there right now loaded and ready to pop off essentially at the push of a button?

While it's very likely that NK wouldn't hit South Korea with a nuke, they hold zero love for the Japanese.  It might be questionable whether they can hit US territory (Hawaii being the most likely target), but their horrible misfiring weaponry is two feet away from Japan.  Without missile defense and cyber whatnot, if they just wanted to hit Japan, they could.

So, the game Mr Trump is playing now is very high stakes.  Attacking North Korea is gambling on preventing them firing a nuke AND preventing their artillery from laying Seoul to waste.  There's no redo if you screw that up.

Now, say they pull it off.  Bam bam.  No nuke, no artillery.  Does that mean Kim Jong Un is overthrown?  Uh, maybe, but that leaves a vacuum there.  The US cannot invade NK from South Korea.  The border is basically one big land mine.  Meanwhile, China can walk right in.

As someone else mentioned, they might accept a unified South Korea without US forces there, but they might just hold North Korea until they see that US forces have left.

Does the US plan to leave Korea, their major stronghold in Asia?  They would if the South told them to leave, but they won't just pack it up otherwise.

So, now you have a whole new problem with a Chinese-occupied North Korea directly bordering a US-occupied South Korea, and that's only if all of this goes off without a nuke being detonated and Seoul being destroyed.

In my experience, people who live a million miles away from all of this are far more giddy to see what happens than the people on the ground there who might die.

I'm sure neither South Korea nor Japan has told Trump they want him to go sort this out for them, and anybody eager to get the war on should be careful what they wish for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand what you're saying, but I don't accept the "one-shot" narrative.

Sessions perjured himself.  Do we need secret FBI info about that?  No.  He did it in public.

Kushner failed to disclose his Russian contacts during his process to get security clearance.  Do we know that?  Yes.  This isn't about something that happened last fall.  It happened right now and we know it happened.

Should we be concerned that, if we charge Sessions or Kushner, some critical info from June to November might be lost or destroyed?  No, they would have already done so.

Should we not prosecute them because they're being secretly investigated and might reveal some further info?  No.  They know they're being investigated.

And what kind of country do we have if people who should be prosecuted are, in the meantime, arguing further legal issues and going on visits representing the White House?

This has nothing to do with the longer investigation.  It's like if I murdered someone in January on tape, but there was another murder last summer by my friends, then I shouldn't be arrested until the investigation of my friends is complete, and we should treat it all as one crime.  No.

Crimes have been committed, and the people who committed them are not just walking the street, they're functioning as part of and representing our government.

Bullshit.  If you committed perjury, you don't simply get to recuse yourself from one investigation and go on serving as attorney general.  You get removed and stand trial.

If this is another Democrat boohoo-the-GOP-is-in-charge moment, then the entire Democrat party can stand down and we'll let the ACLU represent us in congress. 

The Democrats get no slack here.  There are less than ten of them agitating while the rest just sit and watch.

If they have principles that the GOP lacks, and that's not some done deal just because the GOP sucks, then they need to be doing everything possible right now to commence prosecution.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I'm not sure about this anymore.

If we will have an independent commission, we would have had one already.

While I appreciate that it took years to impeach Nixon, this is 2017 and the person in charge is readying a nuclear confrontation.

I can't buy that Jeff Sessions is still in a government role while he committed perjury.

I can't buy that Jared Kushner lied to get his security clearance and is just sitting there conducting business as usual.

This umbrella has grown too large and it's still growing.

Maybe, just maybe, "Russia collusion" needs to be subdivided into multiple investigations with Flynn going to jail right now and the Trump himself connections ongoing.

Have we seen enough evidence for serious charges to be brought against certain people?  Yes.  Then bring them.

And why exactly are we not bringing them?  Because the investigation is incomplete?  Well, all of these "suspects" know damn well what's going on and have had ample time to hide/destroy whatever it is they might try to.

The investigation is complete on numerous fronts, and there is no good reason to not pursue these legally and criminally right now.  Right now before more bullshit is attempted by those who will stand accused.  Right now rather than establishing a commission that will draw this out until 2020.

	<TEXT> False equivalence.

If the media were cheerleaders for Hillary, they did a poor poor poor job of calling out the mountain of lies Trump used again and again and again.

Even Nixon didn't wake up every day and lie.  Nor did he run the government for his own personal profit. Nor was he in bed with a hostile foreign government. The only thing close to on par with the current shitshow is Andrew Johnson.  And go have a look at that.  He was impeached largely based on his crooked appointments.

Wait, crooked appointments?  Hmmm... </TEXT>

And they're right that Trump and his supporters have taken this to a new low.

But, for all of this talk of someone challenging Trump's lies, it is the media that woefully failed to do so from the very beginning of his campaign.

So, yeah, let's have a think about this, and that includes you, NYT. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just went and watched footage, and that was a total shitshow.  Both sides at one point or another wanted/provoked/sough out violent physical confrontations, and it was all a sad rip-off of British soccer hooliganism.

It actually took me along time to figure out who was who.  Are the proud boys the ones dressed in black with face masks who look a lot like the new ninja branch of the KKK?  No, those are the "good guys"...  Actually, the proud boys are the ones who look like WWE fans that overthrew comic con.

So, on one side we have a new virulent strain of white nationalist idiocy along with a bunch of impressionable youth who think that's cool.  On the other, we have "Antifa", essentially the shit-stirrers who for the last two decades or so inevitably exploit peaceful protests to trash a McDonald's and overturn a car along with a bunch of impressionable youth who think that's cool.

My real question is where the hell the police are while this turd of a showdown is blossoming.  They seem to be over standing in a park with their riot gear waiting until they can punch the clock and go home.  And seriously, did they erect two snow fences 7 feet apart to separate the two protests?  WTF, they might as well be handing out booze and brass knuckles.  Your typical Klan/anti-Klan protest arrangement separates the two groups by a significant distance, at least a block, with the police in between.  Berkeley PD have to be at least partly liable for that whole scene to the point of saying they failed to do their jobs.

On the other hand, there is some seriously disgusting shit on Youtube with video and commentary that makes those who appear in said videos criminally liable.  Video of people being sucker punched, and one video of a guy with a spiked ring saying he's going to use it to crack some Antifa skulls. Google should be liable for allowing some of that to be hosted on their site.

tldr- That was a contest to see which Americans are bigger idiots than our president, and everybody won.  

I hope they get tired of winning, but nobody looked tired in the videos I saw.

I have to admit I had done some spice shopping before I could make this:

http://www.food.com/recipe/easy-crock-pot-moroccan-chicken-chickpea-and-apricot-tagine-137530

That all said:

-I almost always look at multiple recipe sites and combine, edit, and/or delete ingredients based on what I have and what I like

-I am seldom deterred if I'm missing one of the seasoning ingredients.  Don't have ginger root?  You'll probably find another version of the recipe that doesn't have it.  

-Unlike youtube, this is the perfect time to read the comments sections.  These are filled with people who tried the recipes and very often how they would or did tweak the recipe.

-Within reason, be imaginative.  I wanted to make a meatless version of that chili, but I wasn't sure what kind of "chunkiness" would be a suitable replacement.  Then I saw a can of pineapple.  Hmmm...Do I like pineapple?  Oh yeah.  Would it taste good in chili?  Yes, I think so.  Went for it, and while I was waiting for it to cook, I looked online and found that Hawaiians love them some chili and of course put pineapple in it.  This one won a major chili cook-off:

http://www.mauichili.com/

and when you look at the ingredients:

	<TEXT> I'd say that's overthinking it.  If that logic applied, then the same could said in the opposite way:  having the early California returns would crush the spirit of Republican voters elsewhere.

It's sad that the most easily manipulated people (swing voters, people who let the media tell them who to vote for) seem to decide our national contests, but anyone with a half-functioning brain shouldn't be particularly influenced by seeing California won by the Dem contender or think that the popular vote is any reason to not vote.

Honestly, I really don't think there are people sitting at home the day before election day thinking, "Do I vote or not?"

a) In most places, you had to register beforehand.

b) I can't emphasize enough how many people who are eligible to vote choose not to because of the crappy candidates that get fielded. </TEXT>

http://www.crock-pot.com/slow-cookers/crock-pot-6-quart-slow-cooker-with-stovetop-safe-cooking-pot/SCCPVI600-S.html

That let's you use it like a frying pan/roasting pan.

I personally figure out the order which is best for my ingredients and keep adding as I go.  I almost always sautee onions first because they tend to carmelize rather than burn.  Then, I'll throw in cumin seeds, cardamon pods, and maybe some curry leaves.  After that, the meat (I do a rub before cooking) goes in to get browned.  About this time is also when the garlic goes in because I don't want to burn it.

I guess if you're a pro, you could cook each of the above and then remove it temporarily to a bowl before combining, but that's another dish.

Once the meat is done, now it's time to take this off the stove and move it to the slow cooker where the liquid ingredients get added along with garam masala and/or whatever spice combo you prefer.

Do this at noon.  Come back at 6 or 8 and there it is.  If you have freezer space, you have a week of curry for one person.  If you don't, you have enough to share with friends.  </TEXT>

Mother Jones on Breitbart http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/11/steve-bannon-racist-lets-find-out:

The online publication has been criticized for incendiary articles, such as one that warns of "Muslim invaders" and another that dubs conservative thinker Bill Kristol a "Renegade Jew." One headline offered this fix for online harassment: "women should log off."  

There are many things that separate the alternative right from old-school racist skinheads (to whom they are often idiotically compared), but one thing stands out above all else: intelligence. Skinheads, by and large, are low-information, low-IQ thugs driven by the thrill of violence and tribal hatred. The alternative right are a much smarter group of people  which perhaps suggests why the Left hates them so much. Theyre dangerously bright.

And, seriously, asking which Youtube comments section is the dumbest is like asking which middle school kid is the dumbest.

They're all the dumbest.

But if you really want me to try to answer your question, the dumbest Youtube comments sections are the ones where 40-year-old men still talk like they're still in a middle school lunch room.

That happens all over, but it happens most with politics.

The dumbest youtube comments section is whichever is most similar to the dumbest subreddit, and that's the one with little boys of all ages fantasizing about being president. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm...I think the author is trying to look historically at the first 100 while ignoring the incredible significance of THIS first 100.

Trump has:

-appointed a billionaire cabinet

-placed people with clear white supremacist ties high in his administration

-appointed a series of individuals to head agencies they hate

-ignored obvious conflict-of-interest issues by using his business for government functions and pursued business with foreign countries

-attacked a sovereign country in a case that was not self-defense

-assailed the judicial branch of the US government for not doing his bidding

-assailed the legislative branch for not doing his bidding

-run afoul of constitutional checks and balances in doing both of the above

-failed to find support for signature legislation more than once

-mishandled issues of state secrecy by conducting foreign policy at his Florida resort

-engaged in what is probably nepotism by appointing his daughter and her husband to ambiguous administrative positions

-lied, lied, and lied some more on Twitter, on camera, and on record

-been embroiled in what is probably the greatest political scandal the USA has ever seen 

SO...no, let's not talk Trump.

Let's talk Politico.

YOU are running an article about how the first 100 days is "bogus" when we have never seen a 100 days like this one EVER.

Now, is it that you feel the need to dance around the middle?  Is that what you're doing by playing down the last 100 days of destruction?

OK, then let me humor this for just one moment.  If you're trying to be bipartisan, how about you present this issue as a point/counterpoint article so that someone who hasn't been in a coma since January has a chance to point out how decidedly un-bogus it is to weigh the rape of our national government against the tool you have talking about it in surfer-dude terminology?

Might it just be possible that this is journalistically the wrongest time ever to write off the first 100 days of a presidency as bogus? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Short answer:  When I turned 23, I realized I was as close to 16 as I was to 30.

A fun one for most people here: 9/11 happened in 2001.  We are now 16 years removed from that moment.  Going backwards, we are as far removed from 9/11 as people were in 1985, when it was still 16 years in the future.  O.O

Long answer:

I started to feel old when pop/rock stars were younger than me.  There was a time when they were always older.

Then, I was the same age as most pro athletes.  Say 24 or 25.

Then, I was older than my idols were when they had achieved such great things.  The Beatles had written their canon by age 27.  So had Dylan.  So had so many more.

Then, I was more interested in what movie stars were actually my age but I'd never paid attention to their age before.

By 30, you have some "young" authors around your age.  For me, Eggers and Palahniuk.

In your 30s, there's a whole range of people who will start innovating and creating businesses.  Mark Cuban comes to mind, but it was that whole dotcom explosion.

Then you hit 40 and things become more sinister.  The politicians... I'm in the same age bracket as Ted Cruz, Rubio, and Paul Ryan.  People my age are running for high office.  Damn.  And most of them I thoroughly despise.

But you hold out hope for yourself.  Too late to start that punk band.  Probably not going to be a business dude.  Back to authors.  Yes!  I'm still young enough to write that novel.

Right around this point, a fair number of the rock stars your age have faded or died and the last pro athletes around your age are retiring.

I won't go into how your body doesn't tolerate the sludge you put into it anymore, encountering wee ones too young to give a rat's ass about either Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, or starting to babble about 8-track players, smoking on airplanes, or how everyone in one house had to agree about what to watch on TV. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to agree.  

The wall to the world of cooking for me was a) not wanting to make a pile of dirty dishes and b) not knowing jack about cooking and assuming it would take years to figure out how to make things taste yummy.

Putting all of your ingredients in one pot is a good way not to make a massive clean-up detail later and slow cooking is the ultimate cheat sheet for good grub.  If you don't know what you're doing, flavors synthesize over hours of cooking and you're free to taste here and there over hours to balance out the flavor.  Try it, and then invest in a wider range of spices.

Chili is probably the best place to start.  If you don't like spicy food, fine, evolve your chili into the non-spicy realms.

Indian food seemed like something you need a guru to have a hope of making well, but a little research and 8 hours of slow cooking yielded something I made myself that I can't differentiate from a restaurant.

And holy internet, Batman.  There were days when recipes were things people put in a box.  It's all sitting out there waiting for you. 

Just be sure to sautee your onions (you can get a slow-cooker that will do that right around the $50 mark). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> tldr: citizens can get the anti-corruption act (a series of measures to limit big money donations and tactics) on local ballots.  These local actions then pave the way for passing the anti-corruption act at state level, affecting all candidates in states where it is enacted.  Momentum can then spread to DC and national politics.  Keeping this effort bipartisan is pivotal to its success.

I went into that very cynical and not liking the cartoonish aspect.

I left very impressed with both the idea and sentiment expressed.

Please support and spread this.

	<TEXT> That all comes down to campaign finance reform, and that means getting the corrupt to vote out corruption.

A good start to that would be to end the apportionment acts:

tldr: the size of the House of Representatives should increase with population like it's meant to.

I don't think "most people like that" care about their resume.  I think that once you're rich, power is the next logical thing to crave. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's something about no investigation revelations within a 90-day period before the election.

Then again, I don't know how that jives with the releases on Hillary.

Then then again, I believe I know about the 90-day rule because people jumped on Comey for his revelations.

With 20/20 hindsight. I think where we are now is probably better than the shitstorm that would've erupted if this had been brought out in the middle of the election.

They dished on Hillary but not Trump.  You cannot now argue that the whole thing was biased or unfair towards Trump.  If anything, it was biased in his favor.

Moreover, my guess is that Trump knew about all of this during the election.  That's why he resisted getting intelligence briefings while a candidate.  That's why he immediately went over to intelligence headquarters when he was inaugurated and got his "standing ovation": he was hoping against hope to hit some kind of reset button that would've buried the past.  That's why he freaked out when Sessions recused himself because he needed the Attorney General to leverage this whole debacle in his favor.

And, if the NSA/FBI misbehaved in any way, it's not too late to take them to task in a separate investigation.

Hopefully, that will be just one part of how we fix things so that this never happens again.  The silver lining of the Trump fiasco is that it's shown so many weaknesses in how our system works.  They were going to be there until someone came to test all the loopholes.

Thanks, Donnie.

If the Dems can't get criminal charges in a case where a crime was committed, then maybe they need to stop governing and let the ACLU legislate and lead us out of this mess.  And I don't mean two fucking years from now, either.  Show spine or gtfo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bring your own food, but it's more fun and interactive than air travel.

Easier to talk to other passengers.  You get a greater appreciation for the vast spaces out there.

The trains connecting the midwest to the west (Southwest Chief and California Zephyr) are, IMO, the best experience.  Chugging across the plains for what seems like forever and then, holy crap, what's that?  The Rockies!  I never get tired of that.

The euro train experience is better with the compartments, but Amtrak is still fun.  If you have to keep doing the same route I can see how it's less fun, but any travel is better than never traveling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difference is that you don't get to see the Fox and talk radio communities, whereas on social media you get to see these people in all their glory.

Look at Reddit and r/t_d.  I'd argue that the opposite of polarization is occurring overall.  Maybe for some non-bigoted, non-corrupt, non-crazy reason (can't think of one offhand, but humor me) you think you like Trump.  All you need to do is go to t_d and look around for three minutes.  Then any sane person will ask themself, do I want to be a part of or even associated with this happy crap?  No.

Sure, social media is polarizing in that the far right can get together and meet one another, but it unifies more people than it pushes in these directions.  That's a far less sexy story than OMG the USA is split right down the middle.

It is indeed split but more convergent than divergent. </TEXT>
