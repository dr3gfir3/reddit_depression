	<TITLE> You'll Never Gain Muscle on a Vegan Diet </TITLE>

That's what I was told by just about every single person when I went vegan back in January. As you can see from 3/18-4/29 that is most definitely not the case...my FFM (muscle) went up 15lbs and my fat % dropped almost 10%. 

RIP my poor frail vegan body.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't listen to all the fad regarding a zero carb diet, there's actually several detriments to a low card diet also. I was keto for about a year into my weight loss journey before it started harming my body. I was lethargic, my recovery time was absolute shit and I could not focus at all. I would go week long periods without having bowel movements, I was burning right through my muscle and was having constantly chest pains.  According to one particular study, " Complications such as heart arrhythmias, cardiac contractile function impairment, sudden death, osteoporosis, kidney damage, increased cancer risk, impairment of physical activity and lipid abnormalities can all be linked to long-term restriction of carbohydrates in the diet."

Simple calories in, calories out. Eat whole foods, nothing processed. Lots of veggies. I switched from keto to a whole foods, plant based diet and have never felt better. I'm killing it in the gym (six session a week. Two weight lifting, four triathlon training), my recovery time is incredible and I feel better than I ever have. However, that's not for everyone. Find something that works for you. 

Here's some studies about low carb diets, also:

	<TEXT> I started off my weight loss journey doing keto and got really, really good results. However, after I started really working out hard/training for triathlons, I could feel my body slowing down. I became lethargic, couldn't focus and constantly tired. Don't buy into the myths about the dangers of high carbs. Yes, sugary, processed foods that are high in carbs are obviously not good for you. However, legumes are high in carbs and are great for you. 

I decided to switch to a whole foods, plant based diet recently and it has been the best thing I've ever done. My body feels light, airy and my recovery time in the gym is like never before. I know it's not for everyone but I'm in love. I eat between 100-250g's of carbs and am still consistently losing weight at the same clip I did under a keto diet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finally had to go and get a new license picture since my last one was from my fat dayz. Kinda rewarding for people not to notice me, just not the sideways glances when someone doesn't believe it's you in your ID.

	<TEXT> Big cyclist here, talking like 20-25M rides a day. The Gatorade is no joke. I was so against it when someone mentioned it to me but those sugars are so necessary to get through the rides. Highly suggest it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, I know, I know. This is more of a "is my thinking right" post more than concern. I think that's going to be the plan, stay off the scale for a couple weeks and see what happens. 

On a side note: eating a plant based diet makes sure there's always very little shit in my intestines, that's always the first thing I think of when I see weight in hahaha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello r/loseit!

I have kind of a question/kind of motivation needed post here for you folks. I have been on the downhill slide of weight loss, only have about another 30-40lbs left to go on my already 103lbs loss. I am hitting the gym six days a week: two days doing strength training with a personal trainer, three days training for a triathlon (so lots and lots of cardio) and a day of Capoeira training. My BMR is currently 2,233 according to the scale at my local gym. I'm eating generally around 1,700 calories a day, all whole, plant based foods. My goal: look sexy AF. Muscular and lean. 

I went through a two week stretch where I was in limbo between trainers and didn't really do much weight lifting. However, now I'm back into the strength training mix. I've been weighing myself and consistently have been weighing in around 228lbs for the past one-two weeks. For example, on 3/20 I weighed in at 226.3 with 26.3% body fat. This morning I weighed in at 229 with 24.7% body fat. Therefore, I can contribute a portion of that weight gain to muscle gain which is fine. However, will that weight number begin to fall once I stop gaining noob muscle gains? I'm just getting so disgruntled seeing that number on the scale climb up when I'm consistently eating at a deficit and working my ass off in the gym. My trainer keeps telling me that nothing burns fat like muscle but dammit it's pissing me off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, no. Unfortunately those two are pretty locked in. I could add some biking/running to that Saturday after capoeira though. That would still give me two off days and two extra sessions of running/biking. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Nervous About Rest Day - M/23/220 </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello all,

Cross posted to r/triathlon.

I am training for my first olympic distance triathlon in May, also my first triathlon ever so I'm very, very pumped. Got all my running gear done, my bike situated, the works.

Here's my current workout schedule before I get to my question:

Sunday - Rest.

Monday - Moderate Swim/Moderate Run.

Tuesday - hour strength training with personal trainer.

Wednesday - Short Swim/Short Bike/Short Run.

Thursday - Moderate Swim/Moderate Bike.

Friday - Hour strength training with personal trainer (AM), one hour Capoeria training (PM).

Saturday - two hour Capoeira training.

By moderate is generally medium-longer distances...this week it was a 0.5M swim followed by a 3.5 run, those distances will gradually increase the closer I get to May obviously.

QUESTION TIME: I am debating taking that Wednesday and making it an additional rest day. I don't want to get burned out and have been consistently sore on that Wednesday workout. Will that extra day off push me back significantly endurance wise or is it necessary? What are your thoughts on rest days during training? THANKS GANG. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Cluster of a Question - Triathlon Training/Strength Training </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-24 01:45:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all,

Just FYI, this question is a total clusterfuck. Let me break down my stats for you: Male, 6 foot even, 224lbs, BMR = 2233, eating around 1,600 calories a day. Goal: look sexy AF.

So I am on the tail end of weight loss, went from 331 last year to my current 224. I have been doing lots of body weight training and have been successfully losing weight/gaining muscle. 

However, one of my biggest goals is building up to an IronMan. It's something I've always dreamt of doing and now I have the body to do it. Therefore, I'm training for a significantly smaller triathlon. Today I swam 0.3 miles, biked 13 and ran 3, burning around 1,400 calories during the three workouts combined, my Garmin Forerunner shows 3,000+ burned on the day. That's great and all but I have one giant worry: burning straight through my muscle I'm gaining through my strength training. Before I go and have an in-depth discussion about this I want your opinion. 

I suppose my question is will the cardio completely wreck all strength training I'm doing? I make sure to eat a builders bar before my workout, drink some aminos during and a shake complete with two scoops of protein immediately following.  </TEXT>
