	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The second half of 2016 will probably be remembered for its geopolitical shocks and uncertainty rather than as a period of benign economic data.

But to do so would be to only have half of the story.

According to Goldman Sachs' measures of economic activity, the last two quarters of 2016 were really pretty encouraging.

"If you look at economic data for the past few months, there's been an impressive acceleration in growth," Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a speech in London on Monday.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> LONDON: Stock markets flattened Thursday and the dollar lost support as investors gave a lukewarm response to the Federal Reserve's signal that US interest rates may rise faster than expected.

US central bankers on Wednesday hinted that they may need to raise interest rates more rapidly than planned owing to "considerable uncertainty" linked to US President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal stimulus plans that risks fanning inflation.

This was according to minutes of the final 2016 policy meeting in December at which the US central bank lifted rates.

	<TEXT> Its that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the Stocks to Buy for 2017.

Before you take them up on their suggestions, lets look at how well such portfolios did in 2016.

The portfolios of stocks they were telling you to buy generally did much worse than the stock market over all.

	<TEXT> According to the European Commission, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) misled regulators during the companys takeover of WhatsApp. However, the EUs eagerness to take down tech companies has some analysts worried about the future of FB stock.
Apparently, Facebook claimed it could not reliably match user accounts between WhatsApp and its marquee service. This was in 2014, at the height of the merger. But then, two years later, the company began to combine user data in ways it said was impossible.

	<TEXT> Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales would decline in November to a 5.54 million annual pace. Octobers sales pace was revised down to 5.57 million from an earlier estimate of 5.60 million.

Sales last month were up 15.4% compared with the same month a year earlier. The annual gain was exaggerated by a one-off plunge in sales during November 2015 that the NAR had blamed on new federal mortgages rules delaying closings. </TEXT>
