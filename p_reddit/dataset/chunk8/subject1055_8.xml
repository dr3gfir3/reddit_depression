	<TITLE> When practicing a particular exercise/passage, moving up the tempos, at what point do you consider yourself good enough at playing it at a particular tempo to then bump it up a few BMP? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Currently learning Hanon (I know it's very controversial, but the keyboard teacher I'll be starting with in September is very respected and it's already helped me a fair bit), but this applies to pretty much any exercise. I don't really know when I can consider my playing of the exercise good enough to then bump the BPM up and practice it at the new tempo. Is it until I can literally play it for minutes without stopping or making any mistakes at all? Or just very comfortable with it, still prone to the odd mistake here and there, but not quite having spent a ridiculous amount of time? I'd always thought it was the first one (get it perfect), but it's taking so much time. I'm still on the first exercise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excellent answer, thank you. I'll gladly use the sound guy's DI whenever they have one, but for certain gigs we have to do our own sound with our own PA so it'd just be for those situations. Not seeing a lot of options for Dual boxes online - the keyboard I'm using is a relatively new (last 5-10 years) Kawai MP4 Stage Piano, would you think a passive DI box would be alright? I wouldn't want to overload an active box. </TEXT>

<WRITING>
	<TITLE> Noob question; what is the advantage of putting your instrument (in this case a keyboard) through a DI box then into a PA, rather than just putting the instrument directly into the PA? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-10 20:41:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just started gigging as a keyboardist (always gigged as a drummer before), and used a DI box last week for a gig because the sound guy had one. Just put the jack from the keyboard to the box and then the box into the desk. I want to get one because it'll mean I can reliably go to the PA (with the box) without worrying about bringing a massive amp, but I still don't really know exactly what it does.

edit: One more thing; are certain DI boxes better for certain instruments, or would a good DI box be universally good for bass, keyboard etc.? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I can usually run about 6k, but I find one day I can just make it to 3k but at the end still feel as (if not more) exhausted than if I had run 6k on a normal day, will I still only burn half the calories despite feeling like I've exerted myself just as much? Is the amount of calories burned more tied to pure distance or is it more the physical exertion itself? (also I know the distances aren't super impressive, just getting back into running after being out of it for about a year!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really enjoying it, but honestly it seems very tonally different to Season 1, the stakes never seem as high and it's not as engrossing, just generally slow moving. I'm just asking so someone who's watched all 4 can maybe give me a general indication as to whether it sort of returns to the drama of Season 1 or if 2 is sort of the status quo from here on out.  </TEXT>
