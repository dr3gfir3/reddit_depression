	<TEXT> Being able to see past the glaring racial ignorance as a product of its time, I really enjoyed my time with it. Besides a few minor gripes, I never found it boring or drawn out. 

I feel that the novel played a bit fast and loose with the deus ex machinas. A certain flock of birds would show up as soon as the party was about to starve to death, and a random pool of water shows up right before the party dies of thirst. It took me out of the story a few times. 

And that ending, what? Sir Henry's brother, after all this time, just happens to be chilling in the desert with a broken foot.

All things considered, I still had a lot of fun with this book, how about you? What did you think of this book? </TEXT>
