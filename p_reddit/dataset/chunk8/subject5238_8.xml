when I said Rots stands up with the trilogy, I say it to support my statement that quality films have more than one thing going for it, if you object to Rots then pick any quality film with flaws in its place 

this is tv but the glenn death ruined twd for me.  the fake dumpster dive put it in tenuous ground before that  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yes, adoptive children do sometimes say their parents' names depending on how close they are and perhaps clark was trying to distance himself from martha at that point in his life.  lot of maybes which leave it a weak scene but i wouldnt say it ruined the movie.  there were many other things that did that.  full disclosure, i thought the movie was bad but not as bad as some have made it out to be </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this back and forth is what I mean.  okay, it's a weak scene.  he shouldnt have said his mom by name.  but there are 50 other scenes.  even masterpieces have flaws but we don't zero in on them because of the other things that go right.  perhaps films that are "ruined" by one scene aren't as strong as masterpieces but i've seen it said enough that its disproportionate to the number of actually ruined movies vs decent to good movies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> endings are the most precarious as I cited in my example of The Village, but usually those are the ones that rely on twist because so much is riding on the pay off for it.  I can't think of any non-twist ending that ruined my experience.  

Bad acting like Jar Jar nearly ruined Phantom Menace for me but I just blocked him out and the great thing about movies is there are dozens of other things to enjoy whether it's music or wardrobe or acting.  But the bad acting isn't going to be in every scene unless it's the lead of the movie who just can't act.

So I think we're agreeing though you go farther than I do.  I'd love to hear some examples of films from you  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Saw this article about the Darth Vader "No" scream ruining Revenge of the Sith but though it has its flaws, it stands up with the Original Trilogy in quality.

I used to think like that article did in my younger days.  When Trinity revived Neo in the first Matrix, I laughed and said it ruined the movie.  But that was ignoring everything else in the movie that worked and overcame it.

One way a scene can ruin a movie is by being so bad as to change the understanding 
of what we've seen.  The end of The Village comes to mind.

Or by being so awful at the start of the movie that it taints everything else that comes after it which usually happens with weak premises in movies like Speed 2 or any number of "why did they do that" reboots.

Plus, now that I've seen the Matrix a few times since over the years, I actually get that scene now.  So when we say x scene ruins a movie, we're also saying that it is and forever will be irredeemable which is a pretty strong statement that is thrown around too casually by critics and audiences.

Let's be better evaluators and that usually can't be done with a dismissive statement as "x scene ruined the movie." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> im not sure which character had the better arc, im really not interested in "better."  but I think as a measure, luke offers a good one.  I think lukes arc is great but anakins is too with a few rough spots like the rushed romance.  but episode three is pure magic, how hes torn between both sith and jedi, and makes the choice for padme.  his transition to youngling murderer also happens a bit fast but it .makes sense when hes already killed tusken children, it's a war, he thinks he needs to save padme like he couldnt save his mom right now, and the jedi have ignored his troubled feelings etc.   </TEXT>
