	<TEXT> Dude I'm pretty decent with the lore and i had no clue the akaviri did some lizard people invasion shit. I was under the impression akavir was just the Nordic homeland. 

Like I'm at the point where I have a grasp on chim and mantleing and shit like that. They'd need to get some heavy exposition in before revealing something like this.

Then again, theres a reference in the cave after you escape Helgen. "What's next, giant snakes?"

So maybe you're on to something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm hoping it only covers the rise of Kira up until L shows up in person. If it only covers high school a d ends with the college scene? 

"Hello Light.... I wanted to tell you... I am L."

If it ends there, they could pull it off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was guessing because speed runners have completed the game in less than an hour, which to me, suggested that they just dashed straight to ganon. I haven't *watched* a speed run because I'm avoiding spoilers until I shove my sword up Ganon's guts, so I guess I could be wrong. </TEXT>
