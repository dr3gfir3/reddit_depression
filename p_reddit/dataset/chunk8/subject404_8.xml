	<TEXT> I don't think there's a way we can clarify any doubts anyone had about the stream. We weren't going to dive head first into a pool of horror inexperienced in what we were doing. We played the demo on LSD before (and several other experiences) and that didn't even prepare us for the first interaction with the family which I can't unfortunately portray the speed of my heart or the way my brain works on LSD during those specific moments. If anything the LSD I think made me focus and react quicker and had I not taken it I wouldn't have progressed in some points out of fear alone. We Truly enjoyed the stream regardless if you believe us or not and the internet is full of skeptics so I don't blame you, had it been the reverse I would have thought the same. Over all thanks for watching,  we will probably stream more, sober, sometime and as boring as that might sound maybe we will see some of you! Thanks! And also the game is amazing in VR and I truly believe the stream or watching from any other perspective other than inside the headset does not even begin to give this game justice.  </TEXT>
