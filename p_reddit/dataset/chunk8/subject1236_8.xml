Just weeks ago the old couple, who grew 5 plants, didn't recieve jail time, just a fine that wasn't even payed by them, but the people with their donations. I think you could say it is unenforced, I've seen more news about 3 plant growers recieving a nice big fine, but no jail time. Ofcourse, If you have a fucking flat full on 'em plants, you do recieve jail time. Still want it legalized though </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all I'm 15, maybe that's why I don't understand all the clusterfuck in the movie. I have one thing I would need some clarification on.

Were The Narrator and Tyler Durden 2 different people who just were each other copies basically?  
Or was it actually 1 person (narrator and durden), but it was depicted as 2 in the movie?  
Please answer in full sentence with straight answer  
The more I think about it, the more i don't understand.  
  
  
EDIT: Thank you all!
