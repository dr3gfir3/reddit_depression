	<TEXT> That really sucks man. I've gotten some great deals. 75% off the falcon and tydirium. When I pick up in store, I just tell them the "in store" price was cheaper and ask if I can buy for the "in store" price. Usually they're pretty sceptical, since the online prices are usually cheaper than in store prices. They return the item and either refund the card I used to pay for it originally, or they give me a Walmart gift card for the return price. Then they just ring it up as a normal sale and the clearance price comes up. I've had a few of the employees actually congratulate me for finding such good deals. When they need to get approval from a manager, they really haven't cared at all. As long as the price that's ringing up is accurate, there's nothing they can really do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've bought things online from walmart at full price and had them shipped to walmarts that have the item on clearance. I've done it probably 8 different times at a handful of different walmarts, and even had an employee recommend I do it when their app said an item was in stock but wasn't on the shelf. I guess it's a gamble and YMMV since sometimes managers are unwilling to do it, but I've never had any problems. </TEXT>

Anakin's custom 75087 is the newest one and probably the most unique build. I would say either Plo Koon 8093 and Saesee Tiin 9498 are the best bang for your buck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, if you're sending by USPS a single minifigure in a bubble mailer anywhere in the continental US is about $2.54. I think anything up to  either 6oz or 8oz is the same price. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. I usually just say "When I bought this online the in store price was cheaper. Can I buy it for the in  store price?" They're usually pretty sceptical since the online price is usually cheaper than the in store price. But they just have to return it and scan it again. The discounted in store price will show up. </TEXT>
