	<TEXT> Also, color is conceptual not just a stimulus of photon + rod/cone = neurophysical/chemical/electrical result in brain.  We can use color in a controlled experiment with proto-sapient species like cephalopods, corvids etc and they can then independently associate that color with time, space, friends, food, etc.  Aesthetically color is something that we share with a great many other beings on the planet.  

An aside, some cephalopods can use color to communicate relatively complex concepts with eachother, does anyone know of any research on communicating with them?  I'd love to hear a humboldt squid's opinion of the color red.     </TEXT>

You seriously support fake news?  Also, Ann Coulter is a fucking performance artist who has been shouting about censorship for her monstrous bullshit for decades, it is her whole schtick.

	<TEXT> Thanks to centrist cowards 24 million may lose insurance.  

Thanks, but centrism doesn't even have an ethos.  It is the ideology of conmen like Trump .   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Centrists who hate leftists and conservatives, take note.  If the Democrats reject progressivism and do not offer an alternative to the status quo, all the Republicans have to do to win in 2018 is lower taxes and do a gimmick like Bush's tax rebate.  At this point I'd rather have a conservative Democrat like Jimmy Carter than the status quo centrists like Pelosi and Feingold.  At least conservatives have an ethos.  

Gerrymandering in the House will not be solved by 2018, and there are 40+ reliable rural red state senators that will be there until the end of time.  Centrism will not win against Trump.   </TEXT>
