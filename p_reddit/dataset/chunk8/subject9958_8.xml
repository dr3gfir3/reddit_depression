	<TEXT> I truly don't understand why there's so much hate for this game on Reddit. If I never got on Reddit I wouldn't even think anyone hated this game lol I have 4 friends who play with me and none of them use Reddit. All 5 of us have loved the game from hour 1 to now our each 100+ hours of game time. We get disconnects here and there sure, but not so often as to take away from the experience. 

Yes coming up at first we would get beat on by some 108s, but once we figured out how revenged worked it was manageable and something we wanted to strive for. Seeing these geared out beasts dominating the battle field just gave us an urge to play more and attain that level of power. And beating a 108 in a 1v1 encounter in a close Dominion match accounts for many of my early on, epic feeling, moments.

All in all the game is great. There's a learning curve sure, but it's still a unique experience that can't be experienced in any other game at the moment. My friends and I LOVE this game. 

Maybe we're lucky since we have great internet so never really DC when we play. Maybe we didnt look at 108s as a nuisance and more as a goal to achieve. Watching them destroy 2 or 3 of us did nothing but teach us not to go in guns blazing all the time. 

TL;DR Game is amazing for my friends and I and not sure why it gets so much hate. It's really a great experience.

	<TEXT> No nerfs. Just buff the weaker characters and only nerf those that are absolutely above and beyond the rest. 

Right now the only classes I'd consider nerfing are warlord and PK

PK only on consoles though. Light spam is unbearable to defend against with a controller. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unlocking and rolling doesn't counter it. Just prolongs the inevitable because now you've reset to neutral position with way less stamina where they will just begin again. And that backwards dodge seems inconsistent as hell for anyone that doesn't play this all day everyday lol which is most people lol my statement still stands that it's far worse than the conquerors easily countered "vortex" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It definitely can. I as Conqueror do it somewhat often. If I dash right for a SB people's reaction is always to dodge left which is the furthest away from me to go for a light since dodging in my direction almost guarenteed I bash them. anticipating this I hold my guard left after I dash so that my shield is ready to auto block a light if they dodged. Extremely effective and consistent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agree. Deflects risk reward aren't worth it so I rather go for parties or dodge the attack completely and go for a side light or GB into overhead. The deflect is simply not worth it. They need to either make it easier to land or make the heavy afterwards guarenteed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I can't argue with that. He does punish turtling but even when you get offensive on him that vortex gives you a tough time. But hey I never looked at it that way so you gave me a different perspective on it and not so sure about the nerf now lol </TEXT>
