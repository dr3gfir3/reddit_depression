	<TEXT> Quad core is always the better option for applications like this.  I don't have a newer model MBP to say from experience, but that's typically the way it goes.  Sure, the 13" can process the video, but you're asking a lot from a chip that wasn't made for this kind of data processing.  Other things will slow down, things will get hot and it will sound like your computer has asthma (from the fans).

I'd go 15" for this use case- the dedicated graphics are meant to handle this. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Secret Security Clearance and finding a job? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-20 03:47:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all!  I'm entertaining the idea of moving to D.C. within a few months.  First things first, I need a job.  I work in IT, dealing with computers, infrastructure, network etc.  Every job posting I've come across asks if I have "Secret Security Clearance" or "Special Security Clearance" (I forget what it was called).

Can someone shed some light to what all of these job applications are talking about?  I assume it's regarding confidential information and whatnot.  Is there any certification/clearance I must obtain to get a job in the city?  How do I get said clearance?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I work in IT, which really is a service job when you you think about it.  I'm servicing the company's computers/other IT equipment, and the users with their computer problems.  

So today I'm working with a user (let's call her Lisa) who is having troubles with her email.  While working with her, another user comes up to me for help (let's call him Phil).  

Some background on Phil:
Phil is in his mid 50's/early 60s, and he thinks he's "all that".  He isn't even a full-time employee, he's just a contracted temp.  He'll always try to get assistance first, and always asserts his way through.  I've had to stop what I've been doing multiple times just to help him and shut him up.  He's one of those people who says "thank you, I really appreciate it" but means none of the sorts.  

So back to the story.  I'm helping Lisa with her email and Phil comes up to me with a "pressing issue" that I have to reach out to an external vendor *immediately* because he screwed up (essentially throwing me under the bus, making me clean up his work).  Keep in mind that it isn't even my job to do this.

Phil rudely interrupts my conversation with Lisa, and at first I ignore him because I'm obviously working with someone else.  This annoys him and he says "hello?" to me to blatantly steal my attention away from Lisa.  

That's when it happened.  I stood up for myself for the first time in what feels like forever.  I said to him (in a talking-down tone, the tone you'd use while disciplining your kid), "I'm working with someone now, can you wait until I'm done with this?"  He replies sadly with "Yes."

He then waits directly outside of Lisa's cube for me.  That's when I said to him "You don't have to babysit me.  I will get to you when I get to you."  Phil stormed off furiously because he didn't get the attention that he thinks he deserves.  

Lisa stood there with her mouth open, and when he walked away, she mentioned how rude of him that was and how well I handled that.  

I got back to him 30 minutes later only to find out he fixed the issue on his own.  Oh, the glories of working in IT.

This is the first time I stood up for myself in a while and it felt great.  I'm 22, and stood up to a borderline senior bully.  I have no regrets!

TL;DR- Stood up to rude employee at work after dealing with his BS for a while and I've never felt better. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Skin Concerns] Cut on lips not healing- help? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-13 20:57:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It happened once again (same thing last year)... It was November, I was eating some food when I bit my lip. No big deal, I'll just keep applying bacitracin to it. 3 months later it's still there... the harsh cold makes it so hard to keep my skin (let alone lips) hydrated, and the heal times are killer.


It's gotten to the point where my lower lip is in a lot of pain most of the day, and after 3 months, I want my smackers to look like they used to. Last year, I went with the combination of Neosporin, Campho Phenique, and carmex religiously and my issues were cleared up within a week or so. This time around, not so much.
I'd like to avoid going to the dermatologist if I can help it, but I need something that'll clear this up soon. Don't really want to post pics, it's not gruesome but you don't really see what's going on through a photo.


Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I called in today and they switched my family over to the new plan with no problems whatsoever.  The rep said because we each had contracts still, it might be difficult to do.  But they then said because we've been loyal customers for almost 20 years, they switched us over right away.  Saving over $160/month  now. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> In-house IT vs traveling technician? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've worked a Desktop Support job for the past 2-3 years now (working for the in-house IT department) and am on the job search once more.  A lot of the jobs I am coming across are traveling jobs- i.e., you're a traveling IT tech, supporting and traveling to small businesses who don't have an in-house IT department.  I like the idea of being an in-house tech better, and not traveling all over the state as part of my job.  What are your opinions of this type of job?  

On the upside, this job has pretty good benefits and pay you back for your travels.  Plus, I'll be getting a lot of experience that I'm not currently gaining.  But then again, I'd rather not be traveling to different clients.

	<TEXT> IIRC, they throttle you on the old UDP anyway.  There have been times where I was at about 10gb within the first week of my billing period and my LTE speeds were sloooooooow.


Edit:  I know where you're coming from...  I've had it for 6 years too, once the iPhone finally came to Verizon.  I hope now my upgrade process will be a bit easier, so I don't have to take my dad's upgrade and vice versa. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just switched to the new unlimited plan from my old, grandfathered plan.  My parents and I all had unlimited (grandfathered).  Switching to the new unlimited plan saves us over $160 a month, so I think it's  safe to say we made the smart switch.  And if we don't like it, there's a 30-day grace period to switch it back.

	<TEXT> As the title says...

I reimaged a problematic machine, put it on the domain, logged the user in, connected to shares, etc.
Took a look in Active Directory, but the new computer doesn't show up.  The computer thinks it's on the domain but it really isn't?

This is preventing services such as Skype for Business, as well as UNC-ing into the machine.


I looked up this problem but anything on google didn't have any helpful answers.

The computer isn't hidden in any sort of OU.  It should just be part of the entire directory.

To troubleshoot, I took it off the domain and put it back on (2x already).

Any thoughts?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will **always** recommend winter tires, especially on a car like this.  Here's my experience:

Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back. Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.

We did it all. Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice. At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff, and didn't get stuck once.

I really had my doubts about this car in the snow. Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula. We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo. 

All you need are the right tires and a bit of common sense. </TEXT>
