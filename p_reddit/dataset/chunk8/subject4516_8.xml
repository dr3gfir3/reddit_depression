	<TEXT> Maybe she had a super bad day and her kids didn't sleep all the night before and her dog died and her boyfriend was a dick to her. Having a bad day doesn't make someone a bad person, that's something I'm trying to make myself believe currently. She looked like she screwed up slightly and then just sort of froze, like she was utterly defeated, "Fucked it up, might as well die now", I've been there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At 26 I think I was the most conventionally attractive I had ever and will ever be, but photos of when I was 29 I think I'm more beautiful, I was in a good place in my life then. Currently I don't recognise my own face in the mirror, but I am also suffering from major depression and I just heard today that it's a symptom. Hopefully I do look the same to others as I always did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh mate, I dithered as well, it's probably been a year of blaming how I feel on other things, and if I'm really honest it's probably been two years, and if I'm really really honest the anxiety part of things has been there all along. I think partially because of the industry I work in I downgraded my symptoms and thought "Well I don't have it nearly as bad as client a,b or c"

I guess I just ran out of things to blame it on last Friday and I was genuinely afraid for my wellbeing and this was the only thing I hadn't yet tried, and the only other option would have hurt other people far too much. I'm sorry I made it sound so simple but believe me, I feel you. But thank you, I'm glad I did it, and having you compliment me like that really means a lot. Thanks troll xx </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I feel confident that this particular GP will refer me to a psychiatrist if she feels she can no longer help me. As I said in my other comment, I've had some pretty poor experiences with GPS in general and you're right they aren't confident with the nuances of psychotropic meds, but a good practitioner admits that and defers to a specialist, in the past I just had my dose doubled without discussion of trying something else. But I'm partly to blame for that because I was young, I had no clue about the medical and mental health system, in fact I really had no clue about my own body and emotions, I think I initially described it to the GP as having really really bad PMS all the time. I know a fair bit more about how it all works now, so I'll be out there advocating for myself. Thank you for your kind words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm starting on Effexor an SNRI and already had some gnarly side effects the first and second day, second day not as bad as the first so hopefully I'm metabolising it better but I'm off work for the next four weeks so I hope that the meds reach the therapeutic level by the time I have to be functional again. I took an SSRI when I was younger and I was scared to go on one again as I became quite numb and unstable on that, but so far this SNRI is going ok. I know a lot more about myself these days and how to speak up to medical practitioners about my body. 

It is a difficult system to navigate, the last time I asked for help after a close relative died, I asked the GP for a mental health plan and he told me to just go and ask for counselling at the hospital palliative care. He could not grasp that this wasn't purely related to the death, but that the death had been the catalyst for a lot of bad feelings to surface. That was a few years ago and I've been trudging on since then. In the industry I work in I've found time and time again that mental illness is a diagnosis of marginalisation, and despite all the good work that beyond blue, project air etc do, the wider community is still afraid of big emotions. Thanks for the offer I may just need help navigating his one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your kind words trolls. This is the most beautiful, funniest and fiercest online community. I'm going to make it, I've been struggling for years with anxiety and depression, used meds when I was younger but got better at the self care and didn't need them anymore. I work in a stressful job in community services and past six months the depression has become acute, it took me a long time to recognise it. Over the years I've brought it up with General Practioners but none of them have been helpful, and to be honest I probably downgraded my symptoms and since I work in my job I felt selfish asking for help. Last Friday was the worst day I ever had, I can only describe the feeling as Artax in the swamp of sadness. I was sinking and trying to wade through and the harder I tried the slower I went. It hurt. It was anguish. I spent the weekend thinking it over and I went to a local clinic that bulk bills and got help from a lovely woman doctor. I now have a plan to keep safe and despite the initial side effects of the meds I'm going to hang in there. Thanks trolls.  </TEXT>

Eddie Koiki Mabo
Pemulwuy 
Ruby Hunter 
Vincent Lingiari
Charlie Perkins
Ryan Griffen
Charlie Perkins
Emily Kame Kngwarre
Tracey Moffat
David Gulpilil
Jandamarra
Lea Purcell
Wesley Enoch
Stephen Page
Deb Mailman
Archie Roach
Evonne Goolagong
Nova Peris 
Linda Burney
Sally Morgan
Briggs
Deborah Cheetham
Casey Donovan
Jessica Mauboy
Dan Sultan
Gurramul
Mandawuy Yunupingu 

Those are just a few of my heros. I know some of them did fight and die in battle against the invaders, like Pemulwuy and Jandamarra, but their stories need to be heard. Pemulwuy is a particular hero of mine, as is Eddie Mabo, being a unionist. I don't know of many Canadian indigenous heros though, would be great if you shared. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Crickey! Well my only answer is that something really shit happened in those 8 year between my creation and yours, something really crappy. I really don't think there are any such things as girl toys and boy toys but I have noticed over the years a real return of 1950s style gendered segregation of children's toys and clothing. When I was growing up at the beginning of the 80's it was popular to dress little kids (at least in my parents social circles, and they're feminists and socialists) in whatever they wanted to wear, so I'd be in blue overalls and striped t-shirts. But as the decade crept on and definitely during my sister's childhood (who is roughly your age) the pink for girls and blue for boys thing started to really come back in a big way. I just don't understand why! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a fair amount of experience with Borderline Personality Disorder, first of all, it's very tough supporting and loving a person with BPD, so good on you for caring and loving her. This diagnosis can quite often lead to marginalisation for a person as traditional mental health will not see it as an mental illness, and it is seen as particularly resistant to treatment. Dialectic Behaviour Therapy has been proven to be quite effective however with BPD sufferers, and I would suggest looking into that. And for yourself and your mother, self care is the key. If you aren't looking after yourselves you won't be able to deal with her and in fact  situations may escalate because you or mum are not coping,leading to her feeling invalidated, and the cycle continues until thinks get bad enough that she self injures or ends up in mental health for a short stay. If you like, send me a private message and I can give you some resources or maybe help you navigate supports in your local area, although I'm probably not in the same country as you, there is internet and maybe I can help you decipher stuff? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly no, I shall just have to make all my friends addicted and do a big group order! That's a lovely offer though. I've got few imps I might hand out to people and try and get them addicted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm addicted to "Great sword of war" I got it as an imp when I bought a full size of the "Palmyra" limited edition. I need a full size, but the postage to my country is like twice the price of the perfume! I'm trying to con all my friends into doing a group order so it's worth it. I NEED that perfume! What's your favourite? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Believe it or not Speedos are exactly the same thing in my country, tight, Lycra swimming briefs. Although we prefer to call the Budgie Smugglers and they are most often seen on men over the age of forty, over-hanging beer gut, a t-shirt worn with them to cover up back-hair is optional. Apparently it's the ultimate in beach-to-supermarket casual wear in my hometown in summer. Our former Prime Minister famously loved gadding about dressed in his budgie smugglers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry for your loss. My father died a few months before my wedding, I always planned to and did carry a brooch with a photo of him on my wedding day, but a few nights before the wedding I had a dream of him telling me that a candle must be lit and carried through the ceremony, that it was an old folk tradition from where he was from. In the morning I googled and found that it was in fact an old folk tradition from where he was born and that a candle lit would guide the dead to you. I had my sister carry the candle and it was with us the entire day, burning out only when the guests left. 

One other idea I saw that I really liked at a wedding was that they had a moon ornament with the deceased fathers face printed on it, so he was the man in the moon, and all the guests had their photos taken with it. Whatever you choose I'm sure will be perfect for you, and may your fathers spirit ever rise to the magic of eternity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like I have to defend Freud a little bit as a lot of his theories were taken out of context or ridiculed by other physicians and analysts because it didn't fit the popular thinking of the time. He also was the first person to hypothesise that trauma, such as that suffered from sexual abuse or neglect could be a major contributing factor in a number of behavioural and psychological issues, and that exploring this might be helpful for his patients. Whereas his contemporaries at the time were arguing that it was the fragile female mind, hysteria etc and performing drastic and pointless surgeries to cure hysteria.

Now I'm also aware that he was a massive coke addict, and this may have something to do with his wackier theories, but I'll always have a soft spot for old Sigmund for realising something so simple that could be so intrinsic in a person's journey of healing that we have still to fully grasp and recognise today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a guy once who I shared an incredible attraction with. It was like electricity when we kissed, we were drawn to each other like magnets. I hungered for him, and he for me. It was never the right time for us however and it's one of my deepest regrets. We still talk occasionally and I think I will always have a crush on him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In in the same boat, the thought of initiating fills me with anxiety and dread, I've been turned down so many times that I have to steel myself for it. Even still, I sometimes butt I to floods of tears on rejection because I've worked myself up so much, and that makes it worse because according to him I am emasculating and making him feel bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a tough one, ordinarily if I'm getting enough generally, I love quickies, I like the fact that it shows how much my SO desires me, usually happens in that half awake early morning time before work and gives me a nice memory for the whole day. Currently we're in a major slump and have only been intimate about five times this year so far, some of those have been quickies and I have found them deeply unsatisfying, I never orgasm in that amount of time, it makes me feel unattractive, unlovable and like I'm simply a convenient hole. Frankly I would prefer to masturbate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time I was on the freeway and really needed to poop. I stopped at a truck stop and walked into the most horrendous public bathroom. There was no seat, shit all over the bowl and blood all over the floor, but I really really had to go. It was so bad. Right when I was finished I looked up and saw there was a hole in the wall at a certain level. I've never ever gone back there again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could try rubbing around your clit, rather than directly on, or stroke the hood. Or rub beside it. There's this really great website omgyes.com where real women show their techniques, it's a pay site tho, around $30 for membership and I'm guessing you are quite young so you might not want to pay or have the money. But I used to have the same issue as you and then tried some of the methods I saw in the site and had my first solo manual orgasm in my thirties (had always used a vibe) and it was awesome, so much more intense. I've recommended it to friends since the and they have all had good experiences.  </TEXT>
