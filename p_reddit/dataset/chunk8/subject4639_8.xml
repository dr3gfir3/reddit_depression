	<TITLE> [Scents of the Months] Next Up Nominations </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Inaugural thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelifestyle/comments/5c4x4v/scents_of_the_months_novdec_inaugural_thread/)

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelifestyle/comments/5it8ej/scents_of_the_months_update_1/) - includes some reviews of the products. My opinions there are still pretty much the same.

**TL;DR** - Picking a scent "theme," and purchasing various scented-products in that theme.  Post what you got and what you thought of it next update.

_________________________________________

Nominations? Previous theme was "The Woods of Winter" - found some fun woodsy/smokey stuff!  

I would say a good nomination should have a theme, instead of just "mint, because mint."  Hoping to see some good ideas! </TEXT>

At /r/MaleLifestyle/ I started a ["Scents of the months"](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelifestyle/comments/5it8ej/scents_of_the_months_update_1/) thread, so that instead of smelling like MEN, or smelling like random chemicals, we might actually smell like real things.

	<TEXT> My main thing, and the rest of this post will just be dripping in irony because of it -

Stop making everything about me.  

(But hey, we're dealing with depression, we have to talk about these things.)

By that I mean having imaginary arguments/confrontations, which I talked about a bit in the /r/depression/ post. 

And, oddly, it's also made me very selfish, in some ways.  When I find myself in a bad place, I ask, "What's something I can do to make something better," and frequently, I am the thing that needs to get better.  

Similarly, the line, "Why blame myself for all I need help for?"  

People need help.  I need help.  There is no shame in asking for that help, whether it's asking someone you love, a stranger, or yourself. Last night, at around 10PM, I called my parents and asked for them to come over, while it was snowing, because I was starting to hyperventilate and just needed a hug.

It wasn't easy asking for that, at all.  Why am I making my elderly parents drive through the snow late at night? 

I needed help.  They helped. </TEXT>

It seems like **everyone** knows G2A sells game keys, the **vast majority of which** are stolen. And people knew that before this post, but still used the site.

And, someone got scammed, and now it's, "I'll never use G2A again."  Even though that same person might have known with 99% surety, that the keys they were buying were probably thanks to theft.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't a PM right?  Others can see this?

One of the people I've been talking to is my mom, actually.  I'm 36, she's 70, but alcoholism runs in our family and I know she takes antidepressants. Her house was the closest to where the incident occurred, and I (somehow) managed to make it that far, walk in, and collapse on the ground sobbing. 

But after awhile, I did tell her, "I faced my suicide today. And, the silver lining is, I said no."  As I said it's not making me happy.  But there is a relief. 

So um, follow up, and this part's still being processed kinda.  I live in a semi-rural area, and my job involves a lot of driving, and winter and all that bullshit.  That's what lead to the event. 

And I had another job.  Today.  Less than 24 hours later. (Late edit for context: it was about another 100 miles of driving.)

I called my mom.  I told her, I need you to do this for me, but I will be lying down in the back seat, under a blanket the whole time.  Because, if I can't get through that, I might never drive again. (This is part of my depression post - why blame myself for all I need help for?)

Mostly got through it.  There was a total panic attack near catastrophe, but also another good thought.  

I was lying down in the back seat of a car.  Under a blanket.  Not driving.  Not seeing.  I was not in control, of anything.

And I realized, there are always going to be things I am not in control of, like a meth-head semitruck driver nearly killing me.  But, there are also other things I'm not in control of, that I can be in control of.  </TEXT>

The most important thing is "one day at a time." Don't worry about two weeks from now and maybe you'll just crash again, or a month from now and maybe there's some great/crappy event that you know you'll get drunk  over, etc.

Don't worry about the future.  Just ask yourself, "Can I make it through today without drinking?" and do your best to make it through today, and only today. 

And having a fuckup doesn't make you a fuckup. Maybe you'll have a slip. Oh well. It doesn't mean give up, just go back to asking yourself, "Can I make it through today without drinking?" and answering yes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heard a good bit on the radio about Romo yesterday.  Not my opinions here necessarily, but it was interesting.

Tony Romo is possibly the best pocket passer playing today. You can argue Brady, for sure he's great, but his passes are usually very quick, sub-2-second release.  Tony will stand in the pocket for 6, 7, 8 seconds, and when he feels pressure, he just makes tiny little adjustments to his footwork and body positioning, keep his cool, and deliver the pass. 

In the pocket, feeling pressure, Alex Smith will throw it away or go for the easy check down; Aaron Rodgers might spin and scramble; Brady would have already gotten rid of the ball.  But Romo will just make small changes to his position/posture, stay in the pocket, and make the pass.

I'd never really heard that about Romo until yesterday, but it was interesting to hear. </TEXT>

For the first week of trying to change my thoughts, I pretty much woke up every single day feeling like I was going to break into sobs at any point through the day. I still get that feeling a lot. 

But I've started associating that feeling with the ego-demon-image.   Because usually when I have that feeling, it's because ego-demon is being harmed, and it's lashing back at me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two simple lines from a song, and they've really been the perfect description for my depression.  

I've been dealing with depression since puberty I suppose. Lately I think I've been doing a pretty good job of getting myself out of funks, and part of it has been a personal philosophy along the lines of the title.

You'll see how this is a bit awkward for me to talk about in a second, but if it helps someone else dealing with depression, than I'll be any amount of awkward required.

_____
**Personal Story**  

For the past few months I've been trying, and it's very hard, to live by the mantra, "Stop making everything about me."

Relating to the title (I cannot be sure I see the future, in my head) - did some jerk cut me off in traffic? I'm imagining a confrontation with that person, where I'm yelling in their face for being such a big dumb jerk.  Or maybe some cute girl helped me out while I was shopping, and I'm imagining a date with this girl, maybe an entire relationship, and then I'm back to reality and single and sad again. 

I think a lot of my depression comes from "seeing the future, in my head," and they're all futures that don't exist. Living in alternate realities. 

"Why blame myself for all I need help for" - part two.  There have been crazy snow/ice storms around where I live for the past month. Two days ago my car got stuck while driving, and it took 3 people to push me out.  Not 3 people at once.  First one person, that wasn't working, then a second person joined in, still wasn't working, then a third.  

Humiliating.  Absolutely embarrassing and humbling moment. And the whole time I'm sitting there, I'm cursing at a God I don't actually believe in, like this whole experience was just him getting me stuck to laugh at my misery.

C'mon.  I'm not that important. Cars get stuck in snow.  It's something that happens. I needed help, and thankfully, three kind souls helped.  

Why blame myself for all I need help for? 

______

**Coping mechanisms**

I feel I'm already rambling, so maybe if you've already read the above, that's enough to help.  But here's what I've been doing whenever I feel those depressed thoughts creeping up (and they're **always** creeping up).

1) "What's something around me that I can make better?"  - Clean your room, make some nice food, exercise, customize your computer, do some yardwork.  But also things like - a few weeks ago, I saw a neighbor across the street furiously shoveling snow. I mean, he looked young and healthy and I was still worried he'd have a heart attack, at the rate he was shoveling. 

It was one of the hardest things I've done lately, because I am not good with people.  But I went into my house, poured an extra large shot of whiskey, and went over to his place and asked if he needed a drink. Ended up chatting for awhile, and yeah he's going through some shit. 

The point being - I tried to make something around me better.  (I think? Who knows.  An attempt was made.) 

As another short anecdote - I had an absolutely terrible day yesterday, and driving home, I was doing nothing **but** getting into imaginary fights with people. It took several repetitions, but I kept thinking, "I'm in a super bad place right now, what's something I can do to make something better?" - My answer was, go home, drink whiskey, play video games. Childish, maybe. But as soon as I thought of that, I felt this peace. And I went home, and did exactly that, and it felt amazing. (Whiskey and video games isn't always the answer :P )

2) this is my emergency backup - "What's that?" Basically, there's always something around you to get curious about.  Always. I have a coffee mug sitting in front of me.  What blend is the coffee? Why is this region a good coffee region, compared to other regions?  Now I'm googling things, and learning things, and I'm not sitting in a depressed puddle of ego.

______

TL;DR - Sorry there isn't a good TL;DR.  Hopefully this helps even just a little bit, though.

Edit - The song is "Promise me a rose garden" by The M Machine.  I've been playing it a lot, lately. </TEXT>

Um, nope, the Antonio Brown thing kinda represents exactly what Dan loves.  Sports is entertainment.  It is there for fun.  He snapchatted a haircut for 40 minutes, and avoided a few dozen questions like "So the Patriots are 9-0 at home on the road in the rain when trailing at halftime by 3 points,  how will your defense respond to inside guard formation shifts on third down?"  

If you really want to hear those questions, and the shitty answers that will follow, then you really don't get the show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me start my reply with - I absolutely believe Aaron Rodgers is the greatest quarterback I have ever personally witnessed, and possibly all time (I don't know enough history to say so). There was a play in maybe the second quarter where I was yelling at a friend to watch the replay, because even though it was a mostly forgettable play (I think it was a 2nd 8 completion for 5 yards?) - the pass itself was so freaking amazing. 

So let's start there.  I am in no way questioning Rodgers's performance or anything like that. 

I will also completely concede that box scores don't tell the whole story.  See: Chiefs scoring 2 td's, allowing 0 td's, and losing. 

So, minutiae aside, Dak did have the better stats.  Dak did play an amazing game, as a fourth round rookie making his first playoff start.  

Returning to the very original parent comment - 

He's a Rookie and he matched Aaron Rodgers (okay maybe not matched, but certainly competed with)

I think (my opinion, you can disagree) that OP's original intention was very true - as a rookie, he went toe to toe with possibly the greatest QB to ever play. 

I don't think it's terribly incorrect, and (again, IMO), I don't think it's terribly disrespectful towards Rodgers to say that Dak was able to hold his own against him.  </TEXT>

That's fascinating to hear. 

I played around with Plex some before.  This sounds like a pretty great solution. 

The XB1 having an HDMI input sounds like a very deciding factor for the setup I'm picturing.  Wow, this has all been great info.  Thanks a ton! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-01-04 22:24:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Currently, my PC is in my living room, connected to my TV. I am considering a console (for one game and one game only), so most of the other pros/cons can be thrown out the window (pardon the pun). 

I would like to move my PC to my bedroom, replaced by a console in the living room.  I would like this console to very easily integrate with my PC for watching files I've downloaded/etc.  

I mention Sony TV because, while it kind of wirelessly recognizes my PC, it doesn't really do it very well.  Which is where I'd probably lean towards the Xbone. But in my limited time with those, I don't recall those being particularly well integrated either.  

**TL;DR** - I want to play one game.  When I'm not playing that game, I want to watch movies off of my PC wirelessly. What works best in that regard?

Edit : I may also keep my PC in my living room regardless.  Would a wired connection make any difference? </TEXT>

This is kinda "start to finish."  Starts with the device plugged in, putting it on, the frustration getting it synced, then using it once synced.  Keep in mind, this only arrived this morning, and it's now past midnight (happy new year!) and I've had a few to drink among other things. 

Note : I point to my elbow a few times, and shake out my hand a few times. The elbow is important because in a way that's your "projector" and your hand then creates the screen in front of that. 

So it's important to keep in mind where your elbow is.  And sometimes if you're just losing control, give your arm a shake, might have to resync, but then everything is refocused.

Edit : just saw the video missed most of the important bits, making a new one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The pregame interview with Miller was kinda frustrating to watch even as a Charger fan, when he was asked about the changes to the defense, and you know he can't give an honest answer so he gives the stereotypical bs.

I would have loved for him to go "are you fucking insane?! we lost three to five starters?! this isn't the same fucking defense as last year! get that through your fucking head! Edit: It's week fucking 16, and you still can't see that the names on the roster are different?! Fuck!"

Edit2 I know the number is probably a lot higher than 3 to 5 starters </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (Note: In the spirit of the thread, keep in mind this is meant for levity, and these might be my opinions, but I might also be strongly exaggerating them in a Frank Costanza kinda way.)

I got grievances with Chargers fans calling for Mike McCoy to get fired.  

You peoples!  The audacity! Do you realize we're one Philip Rivers away from being the Jaguars?!

We have been decimated by injuries for two seasons now.  Two! Decimated! Our division is now one of the toughest in football! 

Yes, McCoy can go too conservative too quickly. But that's precisely because he's a young/inexperienced head coach, without the trust of the ownership, OR THE FANS! 

Belichik can get away with weirdass risky playcalling, because he knows the next morning, people won't be calling for his head! 

The team is a mess, for many, many, so very many reasons. Mike McCoy isn't one of the bigger reasons. I think what he's been able to do considering all of the injuries and his lack of experience has been admirable.  And you! Should be! Ashamed! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watched the first episode.  Some of the acting parts were eh.  But overall enjoyed it, looked forward to the rest.  It looked like it was continuing Myth Busters, but adding a twist to make it unique.  Cool.

Then episode 2, where it was nothing but dramatic reenactments with maybe one experiment/test performed?  Episode 3 the same but with no experiments/tests?  

By episode 4 I just started fastforwarding through, looking at what the thumbnail looked like on the timeline to see if the thumbnail was acting or experiments.  And it looked like there wasn't a single one.

I don't have a problem if they want to do something that isn't Myth Busters.  That's perfectly understandable.  But the first episode of this series made it look like it would be a lot different than the rest of it turned out. 

TL;DR - first episode involved experiments/building things, then they stopped doing that. </TEXT>

I am fairly certain I could cherry-pick stats that make your favorite player look like the worst player of all time.  I could find weird stats like "when trailing one score in the fourth quarter on the road with the temperature below 20 degrees, aaron rodgers (or tom brady/manning/etc) is the worst QB of all time."

You are doing to his overall argument what stupid sports fans do when they do that.  You're cherry picking quotes instead of stats.  Look at the overall body of work instead.   </TEXT>

But like with the Assassin's Creed read lately...is he really screwing it up each time?  I loved today's show partly because first I thought "wow when he says jeremy irons he sounds like the mariota-growing-up-in-front-of-our-eyes read" and he immediately brought up he couldn't say Irons.  Then later I thought he really was saying Fassbender (and the French chick's) name differently each time.  And he immediately said he read it differently each time!

Do I need to delete this post so that the Stugotz Army doesn't assassinate me to keep the truth quiet? </TEXT>
