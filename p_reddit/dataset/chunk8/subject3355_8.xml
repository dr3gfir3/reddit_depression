	<TEXT> No problem. It's an issue that bothers me greatly, as no one seems to pay attention to it, so I'm glad that I've spread the word at all.  

Livestock, especially ruminants such as cattle, producemethane (CH4)as part of their normal digestive processes. This process is called enteric fermentation, and it represents almost one third of the emissions from the Agriculture economic sector.


The way in which manure from livestock is managed also contributes to CH4and N2O emissions. Different manure treatment andstorage methods affect how much of these greenhouse gases are produced. Manure management accounts for about 15 percentof the total greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture economic sector in the United States.

	<TEXT> I can't deal with Sandy Hook deniers. Sociopaths. Losing a child has to be the worst loss one can experience. I'll never forget how broken her mother was when my best friend died. 

There's a great quote from Six Feet Under about this:

You know what I find interesting? If you lose a spouse, you're called a widow, or a widower. If you're a child and you lose your parents, then you're an orphan. But what's the word to describe a parent who loses a child? I guess that's just too fucking awful to even have a name. 

Edit: Some sick fuck just pm'd me asking for proof that it happened. This is the kind of person I was talking about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Las Cruces is nice. It's gonna be hot as hell compared to Des Moines in the summer, but it'll be a dry heat which is *way* more bearable (until it gets over 120, then you create your own humidity). Monsoon season sucks, though. Bright side, compared to what you're used to, the winters will be a breeze.

As far as culture goes, it'll be different. But wonderful. The food is amazing (I moved away from my border town home and haven't found good Mexican food since, which is a serious problem) and my best friend's parents treat me like their own, even though neither of them are fluent in English. To generalize grossly from my personal experience, border communities are closely knit and deeply loving. Make sure you participate in whatever festivals take place and just be friendly. Shouldn't be a problem for an Iowan. 

I don't know about Las Cruces, but my hometown had a bit of a gang problem. The wall by my house gets tagged pretty often, I have distinct memories of a couple drive-bys in my childhood and my high school was the site of some gruesome fights. That's something you may want to check up on, but it can easily be avoided if you're in the right neighborhood. My house was very much *not*. 

Last thing, the sunrises and sunsets in this part of the country are like nothing else in this world. We've got so much horizon that the sun sets the sky on fire. It's one of my favorite things about where I grew up. If you do end up moving out west, you'll see what I mean. 

That's all I can think of, really. Is there anything specific you had questions about? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Black American culture is a thing. When Africans were taken as slaves, they lost their cultural identity and created a new one in America. Most black Americans can't tell you where their families came from - not with any certainty, anyway. Slave traders took their culture from them by force, their "owners" forbade celebration of their culture, and so they made a new one. That's a big part of what Black Pride is about in the States.

Meanwhile, I'm white and I can tell you which of my ancestors came from where and a lot of my ancestral heritage is still a part of family tradition. 

There is not a "white culture" in the States outside of certain, historically isolated or oppressed groups, in the same way that there is in the black community. Black pride and white pride are totally different animals for that, among many other reasons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup. My parents are Midwestern, I was born in the Desert Southwest. I was raised in a community of Mexican immigrants (my best friend's parents were undocumented until 10 years ago), and being white, I was part of a tiny minority (like, maybe 15% of the population). I'm grateful for my upbringing because I think it made me a much more empathetic person and it certainly made me more aware of how differently I am treated by authority figures. The contrast between police and teachers' attitudes towards me and my nonwhite friends was stark, and I never went through the "white people are oppressed!" phase like some of my cousins back east did. 

I'm in college now, and I love it. Meeting people of different backgrounds is one of my favorite things to do. I agree, it seems impossible that someone could go to uni and not come out more open-minded and liberal.  </TEXT>

He is the most progressive person I know (he was a Freedom Rider and worked for Women's Lib as much as he could) and says Iowa used to be more forward-thinking. He's really torn up about how far backwards the state has fallen since he was a kid. It's a shame. Iowa is a beautiful place and I hope it gets back on its feet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand that racism played a big role in the election, not to mention the rampant sexism and xenophobia. However, dismissing the plurality of Trump voters who just need some  and perspective as white supremacists is counterproductive. Accusing them of white supremacism will only serve to alienate those who have the capacity and humility to admit that they've been wrong and want to better themselves. 

As for the bona fide white supremacists, fascists, and assorted bigots, yeah, they're definitely a thing. They may be beyond help. Even so, the more the left mobilizes and educates, the more non-deplorables we can swing over to our side.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom's best friend in college had three abortions in the four years she was getting her degree. This was in the 80's, when it was still fairly accessable. All three times, my mom made the phone calls to the clinic and helped her through the process, and after each one, the friend's mother told her "we do not speak of this. If you must talk about it at all, you miscarried." All three pregnancies were with the same man, whom she eventually married and had kids with. 

That friend is now as anti-choice as it gets. Both of her sons had kids in high school, and frankly, they shouldn't have. Her daughter "miscarried" at 14, or that's the story they tell. I firmly believe she had an abortion and they're using the family line to avoid blatant hypocrisy. It's fucking reprehensible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Using this in the future, thank you. It's grew up as a white person in a Latin community so I experienced white privilege firsthand daily for 18 years, which was obvious as hell because I was usually one of two white people in the room (including my teacher).

One of my first memories was 9/11, I legitimately don't remember a time we weren't in an illegal war, and then the economy collapsed right as I was looking for my first job.

But I still believe that the government can be a force for good. We just have to work at it.   </TEXT>

No one in their right mind thinks he's going to last four years. He won't be campaigning again.

	<TEXT> Oh, wow, I didn't know she broke 40%! I had checked the numbers before they were all officially counted and hadn't since, so that's probably where I got my figure. 

I fundraised for her campaign a couple of times, and I met her once last year. She seems like a great person and she was very gracious to our organizers. Plus, I agreed with her on basically every issue I've heard her speak about. 

If it's Sinema, that's fine by me. I think she's a good candidate, too. Frankly, I'd vote for a toaster oven if it meant Flake were gone. He's awful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't be surprised if Kirkpatrick went for it again. Her odds Anson McCain were abysmal, since he's basically Arizona's golden boy. Against Flake, though, she might have a decent shot. Especially considering the current atmosphere surrounding him. 

She got 30-something percent against McCain. With the right funding and GOTV, she could unseat Flake I think. </TEXT>
