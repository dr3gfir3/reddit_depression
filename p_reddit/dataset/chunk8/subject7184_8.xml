	<TEXT> To be fair, before I actually had a child, I thought it was pretty much a piece of cake to be a SAHM.  I envisioned it being peaceful, relaxing, and chill.  Pretty much a permanent vacation.  Obviously, I know better now xD

So, good for you.  You're fighting the good fight and you're winning.  Good luck with school :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Growing up I always asked for an allowance but I was not given one.  My parents always said that "I got what I needed when I needed it." - which is to say they bought me some things when I asked, rather than give me $$.  Whenever we got money for birthday, a holiday, rewards for good grades, etc the money was taken to the bank.  For Christmas/birthday, though my mom would put away 1/2 and we could spend 1/2 at Toys R Us.

I didn't have any issues with learning what money is, or how to save or anything like that b/c my parents also took the time to explain it to me, how checks work, how to pay bills, how to save money, etc.

So my thought here when BabySpawn is old enough is that yes, I will give him an allowance if he does all of his chores.  His chores (  eventually schoolwork) are his "job" just like my going to the office is a job.  From there I will teach him to save a percentage, and have some pocket money, too. </TEXT>

Try to tell him it's going to be an adventure!  Or, I remember just before I started Kindergarten my mom took me to visit the school I'd be starting in later in the year.  I was really excited to see it and see my classroom, then excited to start in a couple of months. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've posted on that forum and I will say the same thing here - I love seeing Custom CSS, and when I use my phone I don't care that it doesn't look quite the same.  I mostly use Reddit on a PC anyway.  I really enjoy seeing the different themes and such.  One of my subreddits even changes their theme monthly to fit whatever is going on at the time.

Actually, that is one thing I wish for this forum - seeing the CSS updated more with different themes.  Maybe feature a different character from Legion every month or so.  Colours generally don't matter.  Black or white is fine with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I never got fat comments, now that I've lost so much, I keep getting comments from some family members.  Mostly saying I don't need to lose more, I won't ever be my high school weight again, etc.  I just say thanks for the advice, but I'm going to keep doing what I need to be healthy.  If they keep pushing, I say something snarky like, "Oh thanks, didn't know you were a doctor."

	<TEXT> I'm going to guess.

If you are leveling an alt that starts out wearing leather, but then later can wear mail, that could be where the "new" gear came from, as you won't be able to xmog it if you can't use it.  Some items also have character level restrictions.  If you're level 20, you can't use gear that says "Level 50" on it. </TEXT>

You should try to have an open conversation with him, and try to be calm (hah!) about it.  Ask him to come clean about everything - this is his 1 chance.  Let him talk it out, apologize, etc.  Then (if you feel he hasn't done any major violations) forgive him, while telling him that if he lies to you again, there's going to be very serious repercussions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone just wants to get shit done ASAP. No time for words, nor emotes, nor stopping to help.

I almost always say hello when I join a group, will say random BS if needed, and say thank you when done.  If I am able, I will stop to help kill a mob or help someone getting ganked.  (Though if I'm being honest, if Horde is killing you, I'm probably just going to keep moving; I'm not very good at PVP so I generally avoid it when possible.)

Most people probably don't chat much in dungeons and such b/c they are probably on Discord together.  If you want to have a more social time, join a decent guild.  It may be difficult to find one, but they are out there.  What server are you on?  US/EU?  There is a guild recruitment thread you can check out and possibly find a place that works for you.

I've played consistently since 2008 and a big part of that is the social interaction.  I've made friends here that I would never have met otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When BabySpawn is old enough that it matters, I plan to give him the freedoms I never had, if he is capable of handling them.  I was very sheltered when I was growing up   I lived on a busy road so there weren't any kids to play with like there would be in a neighourhood.  I was a very good kid, high grades, behaved well, etc, but I was almost never allowed to go out and do things with other kids, so I had no friends.  If BabySpawn proves himself to be responsible, I will give him those freedoms (of course within moderation) that I did not have - such as sleepovers, getting to swim at friends' houses, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know how you feel.  I was 100% "omg I need to breastfeed my baby" and when I simply couldn't do it (for various reasons) I decided to first supplement, then switch completely to formula.  And I *did* feel like I failed myself.  And my baby.  I was literally crying in the pediatrician's office when I told her I started supplementing.  She took my hand and told me in the calmest, kindest voice ever, "Fed is best.  They all grow."  And though I knew this, I used to *say* this to everyone...hearing her say that touched me and I just felt relief.  So, whatever you decide to do, I applaud you.  But just know this: **you are not a failure**.

Talking and posting here will def help you.  I only wish that I had known what Reddit was when I had a tiny newborn.  It would have probably saved me SO much suffering.

	<TEXT> When I started working at AcmeCorps, I was introduced to everyone on my shift by my supervisor, and given a little blurb about what he or she did.  Ronnie was mostly professional when describing everyones functions and providing a little anecdote about their personalities.  Everyone smiled and laughed.  But when he came to Betty, he wrinkled his nose and gave a stilted, short statement  She sends faxes and orders supplies.  No joking or kidding there.  Betty didnt acknowledge us, either, but instead kept herself busy with her paper filing.

After wed moved past the intros and back into Ronnies office to go over the last bits of remaining paperwork, I cautiously broached the topic.  So.  That Betty is the quiet one in the office?

Ronnie looked me dead in the eyes.  Leave her to her own devices.  She doesnt get along with anyone, but she hasnt really given me a reason to fire her.  Ronnie seemed annoyed, but I let it go.  I was new, and I didnt want to make waves.  We finished our paperwork and Ronnie took me back out to the main floor.  He seated me at a computer in my new, small office and showed me how to complete a few invoices.  When I was done, I was to give all of my invoices to Betty.

After completing all of my tasks, I took my small stack of papers to Betty.  Hey, Betty.  Im Gerald.  Im the new guy.  Just wanted to give you my work for faxing.  Should I leave it anyplace in particular?  She looked up from her tasks, pale yellow sweater smudged with some dust and an almost animal wariness in her eyes.  Right over there in the inbox.  Thanks, she responded curtly, then she went back to her work.

Okay, great, no problem, thanks for taking care of these, I replied.  What can I say, I may not want to create waves, but Im not rude either.

Betty didnt seem too weird, shoved in a corner with towering boxes of old invoices waiting to be shipped away to a long-term storage facility.  Her desk looked like it didnt belong there, but it was the only place they could put her, away from everyone.  Despite the warnings, I felt bad for her.  So, every day for the next couple of weeks I made it a point to make small talk with her.  At first, she barely responded, but she eventually warmed up to me.  We started to eat lunch together.  I talked openly about my family; my wife and 2 kids.  She just sat and listened.

Betty started to talk to me during the day on the floor.  Shed call over to me to ask if Id bring her a coffee, if Id made sure fresh paper for the day had been brought out, things like that.  People started to tease me about her being my work wife but never, ever in front of her.  I laughed at their jokes and agreed.

One Friday night Betty and I had to work late because of a snowstorm.  Everyone had either worked from home or left already, but I had volunteered to stay.  I didnt realize Betty had, either.  Everything was pretty usual until I brought my paperwork over meaning to fax everything myself.  There sat Betty at her desk behind the boxes.  I hadnt seen her until then.  She was wearing a lacy red bra and panties and nothing else.  Im your work wife, arent I? she whispered.  I gasped.  Before I could react, she stood and wrapped her arms around me.  My paperwork fluttered to the floor.  She kissed me fiercely.  I tried to resist.  I dont think I kissed her back.  Im still not sure.  But I did break free.

B-BettyIm married, and I dont think this isappropriate, I managed to say.  I backed up and ran down the hallway, out front door and into the snow.  I dove in my car and locked the doors.  Snow flew inside with me, soaking everything.  Dimly, I could see movement through the snow swirling around outside.

Holy crap, it was Betty still wearing only that lacy underwear and following me to my car.  She started pounding on the windows for me to let her in.  She was crying.  After a few minutes, she wasnt slowing down and I didnt want her to freeze to death, so I opened the door.  She climbed in, shivering.  I reached into the backseat and threw her a blanket, which she wrapped around herself.  She reached for me again, and I gently pushed her back.

Betty, you have made my days here wonderful, but you are just my friend.  Im sorry that we can never be more than that.  I hope, somehow, we can still remain friends.  Im willing to forget this ever happened, and I wont mention it to anyone.  Nobody will ever know, I said, my eyes searching her face.

As I spoke, the fire left Bettys eyes and she stared at me dully.  Of course, Gerry.  Iunderstand.  I was wrong.  Her voice was flat, and her shoulders sagged.  Her body conveyed complete and utter defeat.  I patted her shoulder gently and offered to walk her inside.  She did not resist or comment.

While Betty got dressed, I completed the rest of my work and tidied up my office.  I chatted with her as normally as I possibly could as she faxed the paperwork.  I kept glancing out the window, hoping the snow would subside enough for me to try to make it home.  She followed my line of sight.  Hey listen.  Why dont you head home?  I can finish up this faxing and Ill lock up.  I smiled at her and said my simple, quick goodbyes.  I cleaned off my car and slowly made my way home.

The weekend went well.  Building snowmen with the kids, enjoying my family.  I really had all but forgotten the strange encounter with Betty.  When Monday rolled around I headed into my building holding a box of donuts for everyone.  I set the box down in the front of the room and headed to my office.  I opened my door and switched on the lights.  My brain refused to register what happened next.  All I remember is that I first gagged, then started yelling and the rest is kind of a blur.  Ronnie filled me in later.

You see, sometime after I left, Betty had changed back into her red lacy panties and entered my office.  She had carved the words work wife into her stomach with my letter opener and proceeded to slit her wrists.  Somehow she had managed to cut deep enough to bleed out, but not so deep that it was instantly.  She had time walk around my office, and touch everything.  In her own blood, she had smeared on my wall, You will never forget.  But thats not the strangest thing.

Apparently Betty had taken my family portrait and had pasted her face over my wifes.  She took the photo of my wife sitting on our deck and Betty drew all kinds of swiggles and x-marks all over it.  On the back of the frame, Betty had written, Soon. </TEXT>
