	<TITLE> Book Insights from The Next Level by Scott Eblin </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-21 07:09:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What do new executives  or those simply looking to improve in their roles  need to do in order to take things up a notch? Scott Eblins The Next Level shows us exactly what can be done not only to optimize a leaders individual performance, but also the performance of the organization as a whole.

**1. Communicate Effectively**

Eblin points out that communication should be custom-fit. Leaders, he says, produce and deal in ideas, but in order for these ideas to take flight, there must be an effective communication process in place. On an organizational level, this might mean using transparency in order to put people at ease.

With Your Boss:

When communicating with your boss, you should consider adopting this three-pronged communication approach: ask what, referring to what issue needs to be considered or addressed; then so what, to address the implications of the issue that makes it worth considering; finally, ask now what, to establish what needs to be done next, what kind of support you need from your boss, and what milestones your boss can monitor to oversee your progress.

**2. Define What to Do**

Dont focus on how the work must be done; rather, focus on the what aspect. By providing key objectives, youll show that you trust your people to get a specific priority completed through whichever means they see fit. Letting go of the tactical aspects and instead focusing on strategic, measureable outcomes is one of the secrets of reaching  and staying at  the next level.

Framing Objectives:

* What difference will the success of this objective make?
* When is our deadline?
* When pursuing this priority, what actions are off-limits?
* How do we excel beyond todays status quo?

Set guidelines, and be sure to set forth an appropriate degree of availability to check in on progress.

**3. Pick Up Accountability**

You must be able to spot the difference between being responsible (doing the work) and being accountable (closely monitoring others who are performing the work). Your goal is to achieve the latter  it allows you to focus on outcomes, set the agenda, and achieve alignment.

Let Go of Responsibility:

When an individual reaches the next level, he or she may struggle with the less-tangible aspects of the job. Suddenly, youre overseeing processes instead of being enmeshed with them. Yet, letting go of responsibilities is a crucial aspect of operating at the next level, because it will allow you to widen your focus to oversee larger issues, such as the competitive positioning of the organization.

Become Results-Driven:

Because your next-level position leaves you more accountable for outcomes, youll need to become more focused on results. To accomplish this, consider what you can do in order to oversee your teams results. Also, dont forget that youll need to refine your communication processes; dont rely on the work to speak for itself  youll need to provide updates on achievements.

**4. Look Left and Right as You Lead**

Youll need to look left and right, as Eblin puts it, to persuade and influence your peers. To execute these crucial facets of upper-level status, you must establish rapport with your peers by building trust and credibility; then, you can collaborate and show up when youre needed, too.

Look Up:

Find out what success means to your senior executives: which metrics are they set on achieving? What are the deadlines? Who do you need to please when it comes to results?

Look Down

Your capability to stay connected. Again, this means being available and transparent, as well as listening thoroughly. It also helps to express a sincere interest in your people.

**5. Develop an Outside-In View**

Once youre an executive, you should be thinking in terms of us, instead of thinking in terms of me. Better yet, you can adapt an outside-in approach by stepping back and analyzing the organization from an outsiders point-of-view, looking at your fellow executive leaders as them. This practice can help you develop a new perspective and broaden your focus.

**6. Adopt the Big-Footprint View of Your Role**

Your executive status means that people will automatically expect you to have a greater impact across the organization. Youll have increased visibility, so be sure to use your words with precision and thoroughly think before you speak; use a casual approach when addressing emotion-laden issues like compensation, downsizing, and so forth.

Focus on bringing groups together:

The message you send has the ability to be carried forth by the rest of the organization. Put down your smartphone (or any other distractions) during meetings, and instead use your energy on bringing groups together. Actively listen to feedback, and show that the concerns of your people matter to you by taking follow-up action.

**7. Achieve the Engagement Sweet Spot**

Both you and your employees must find balance on the scale of engagement. For your role - focusing on what must get done now by tackling one priority at a time. For an organization - youll want to develop a rhythm in which everyone is synced with these priorities and milestones can be tracked across all levels.

Boost Team Reliance:

You must also be able to access unfiltered feedback from your team, it allows you to see: how well youre performing at the next level, and how well your people are performing in their roles.

	<TITLE> [Misc] Book Insights from "Zero to One" by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters - a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-21 06:58:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **The Past Doesnt Equal the Future**

Thiel believes that the future will be shaped by individuals who take a different stance on things  they possess self-created knowledge that isnt taught in universities, but is commonly held by a few individuals. He asks: **What important truth do very few people agree with you on?**

Moreover, Thiel explores the concept of innovation. Most people believe that it entails globalization, or horizontal extensive progress, he says. Thiel illustrates this concept with a horizontal line graph and the equation 1 to n. He argues that true innovation actually lies in vertical intensive progress, represented by 0 to 1. Startups, he says, are the key to unlocking vertical intensive progress, because **a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.**

In other words, and most importantly, Thiel strongly believes that the past doesnt equal the future.

**Learn the NEW Startup Dogmas**

In the 1990s, tech startups lived by the following four principles:

* Advance in increments
* Dont have a precise plan; be flexible and lean instead
* Improve on the competition
* Focus on your product, not your sales

Following the dotcom crash, however, entrepreneurs applied a new set of doctrines, which were entire opposites of the former ones:

* It is better to be bold and risky than to choose triviality
* Any plan  even a bad one  is better than none at all
* Competitive markets hinder profits
* Sales are every bit as important as products

**Be Creative, not Competitive**

Thiel believes competition should not be your focal point. In fact, he advocates avoiding competition, saying, **If you want to create and capture lasting value, dont build an undifferentiated business.** Instead of overcoming your competition, youre better off focusing your efforts on leading in a smaller market.

**Construct a Monopoly**

Building on the concept of dominating a niche market, Thiel suggests starting small, and then scaling accordingly. To become a monopoly, companies must have the following characteristics:

* Proprietary Technology
* Network Effects
* Scalability
* Branding

Beyond these four main characteristics, Thiel recommends two approaches for building a monopoly:
* Lead in a Specific Niche, then Expand (Amazon)
* Avoid Disruption (Napster)

Forget Luck; Make Success Your Intention

Most CEOs and entrepreneurs already know that success requires hard work and is rarely, if ever, accredited to luck. Thiel backs this claim. To make success your intention, Thiel says you must:

* Determine what you want AND why you want it.
* Come up with a long-term, actionable plan.
* Take strategic action using that plan.

**Build Your Startup using these Fundamentals**

* Drive Focus on One Big Thing
* Define Ownership, Possession, and Control
* Learn How to Sell It

**Ask Yourself these 7 Questions**

* Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
* Is now the right time to start your particular business?
* Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
* Do you have the right team?
* Do you have a way to not just create, but deliver, your product?
* Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?

	<TITLE> Book Insights from The Next Level by Scott Eblin </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-21 06:31:19 </DATE>

	<TEXT> What do new executives  or those simply looking to improve in their roles  need to do in order to take things up a notch? Scott Eblins The Next Level shows us exactly what can be done not only to optimize a leaders individual performance, but also the performance of the organization as a whole.

**1. Communicate Effectively**

Eblin points out that communication should be custom-fit. Leaders, he says, produce and deal in ideas, but in order for these ideas to take flight, there must be an effective communication process in place. On an organizational level, this might mean using transparency in order to put people at ease.

With Your Boss:

When communicating with your boss, you should consider adopting this three-pronged communication approach: ask what, referring to what issue needs to be considered or addressed; then so what, to address the implications of the issue that makes it worth considering; finally, ask now what, to establish what needs to be done next, what kind of support you need from your boss, and what milestones your boss can monitor to oversee your progress.

**2. Define What to Do**

Dont focus on how the work must be done; rather, focus on the what aspect. By providing key objectives, youll show that you trust your people to get a specific priority completed through whichever means they see fit. Letting go of the tactical aspects and instead focusing on strategic, measureable outcomes is one of the secrets of reaching  and staying at  the next level.

Framing Objectives:

* What difference will the success of this objective make?
* When is our deadline?
* When pursuing this priority, what actions are off-limits?
* How do we excel beyond todays status quo?

Set guidelines, and be sure to set forth an appropriate degree of availability to check in on progress.

**3. Pick Up Accountability**

You must be able to spot the difference between being responsible (doing the work) and being accountable (closely monitoring others who are performing the work). Your goal is to achieve the latter  it allows you to focus on outcomes, set the agenda, and achieve alignment.

Let Go of Responsibility:

When an individual reaches the next level, he or she may struggle with the less-tangible aspects of the job. Suddenly, youre overseeing processes instead of being enmeshed with them. Yet, letting go of responsibilities is a crucial aspect of operating at the next level, because it will allow you to widen your focus to oversee larger issues, such as the competitive positioning of the organization.

Become Results-Driven:

Because your next-level position leaves you more accountable for outcomes, youll need to become more focused on results. To accomplish this, consider what you can do in order to oversee your teams results. Also, dont forget that youll need to refine your communication processes; dont rely on the work to speak for itself  youll need to provide updates on achievements.

**4. Look Left and Right as You Lead**

Youll need to look left and right, as Eblin puts it, to persuade and influence your peers. To execute these crucial facets of upper-level status, you must establish rapport with your peers by building trust and credibility; then, you can collaborate and show up when youre needed, too.

Look Up:

Find out what success means to your senior executives: which metrics are they set on achieving? What are the deadlines? Who do you need to please when it comes to results?

Look Down

Your capability to stay connected. Again, this means being available and transparent, as well as listening thoroughly. It also helps to express a sincere interest in your people.

**5. Develop an Outside-In View**

Once youre an executive, you should be thinking in terms of us, instead of thinking in terms of me. Better yet, you can adapt an outside-in approach by stepping back and analyzing the organization from an outsiders point-of-view, looking at your fellow executive leaders as them. This practice can help you develop a new perspective and broaden your focus.

**6. Adopt the Big-Footprint View of Your Role**

Your executive status means that people will automatically expect you to have a greater impact across the organization. Youll have increased visibility, so be sure to use your words with precision and thoroughly think before you speak; use a casual approach when addressing emotion-laden issues like compensation, downsizing, and so forth.

Focus on bringing groups together:

The message you send has the ability to be carried forth by the rest of the organization. Put down your smartphone (or any other distractions) during meetings, and instead use your energy on bringing groups together. Actively listen to feedback, and show that the concerns of your people matter to you by taking follow-up action.

**7. Achieve the Engagement Sweet Spot**

Both you and your employees must find balance on the scale of engagement. For your role - focusing on what must get done now by tackling one priority at a time. For an organization - youll want to develop a rhythm in which everyone is synced with these priorities and milestones can be tracked across all levels.

Boost Team Reliance:

You must also be able to access unfiltered feedback from your team, it allows you to see: how well youre performing at the next level, and how well your people are performing in their roles.

	<TITLE> Book Insights from The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business by Patrick Lencioni </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-15 12:48:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In this book, we learn that equation with the two key requirements for the organizations success is

*a) Smart + b) Healthy.*

**Smart is:** strategy, marketing, finance and technology. These are easier to quantify and deal with and these decision sciences are taught in business schools.

**Healthy is:** minimal politics, minimal confusion, high morale, high productivity, and low turnover among good people.

Thus being smart is only **half of the equation.**

Lencioni further writes that most companies ignore the health side of the organizational equation and focus mainly on the smart side.

1) Start at the top. CEOs, executives and managers must embody the commitment to the health part of the equation in order for their teams to follow.

2) Overcome the 3 Biases:

* *The Sophistication Bias*  that organizational health isnt sophisticated or imperative enough to deal with at a managerial level.
* *The Adrenaline Bias*  that because it doesnt appear on the surface to be a firefighting activity demanding immediate attention, organizational culture doesnt need to be addressed, and
* *The Quantification Bias*  that the benefits of organizational health are too difficult to measure precisely.

3) Balance smart with health. Even after theyve admitted the need to refine organizational health, many leaders resort right back to their old behaviors

4) Build a cohesive leadership team. Lencioni states that if the organization doesnt have a team that is unified then it is not going to become healthy  there is just no way around that.There are *5 Behavioral Principles* for building a cohesive team:

* *Building Trust*  trust is absolutely critical and everyone must trust each other to be a truly cohesive team.
* *Mastering Conflict*  the team must embrace and handle conflict well. Not interpersonal conflict but conflict about issues.
* *Achieving Commitment*  commitment is achieved if conflict on issues is allowed. Otherwise people wont weigh in and wont buy in.
* *Embracing Accountability*  team members must be held accountable to accomplish goals and results.
* *Focusing on Results*  this is the ultimate goal of the prior four behaviors

5) Create clarity and achieve alignment (and Goals   Objectives). Achieving clarity is all about alignment in the company. Real alignment is rare and it cannot be achieved quickly through a one-time email or company presentation. Its a process.

6) Over-communicate clarity. The key here is not merely communicating but OVER-communicating. For it to sink in fully, it must be thoroughly expressed over an extended period of time.

7) Reinforce clarity. Besides vocalizing the answers to the questions from step five, leaders must ensure that this information is reinforced in the human processes of the company. 

8) The 4 Types of Meetings are central to sustaining organizational health. Daily check-ins, tactical staff meetings, topical meetings and quarterly off-site business review meetings are absolutely critical to sustaining organizational health. Leaders are responsible for emphasizing goals, behaviors, and communicative processes.

Lencioni sees a major shift in the mindset of executives towards delegating technical work to their team while focusing on the disciplines that create and maintain organization health.
