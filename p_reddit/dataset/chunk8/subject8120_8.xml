Take a look at this.

http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/208084-scanned-documents-not-appearing-automatically-in-network-folder

Just a quick update in case anyone else reads this and doesn't want to go through the disabling SMB2 route.
adding/setting this registry edit on the clients fixed the issue for us
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters]

I've tried turning off hardware acceleration via GPO with no success. Much appreciated if anyone has any ideas since i've been pounding my head on this since Monday.

EDIT: if anyone runs into this thread while searching for an answer, Looks like one of the April 2016 updates to Office nuked Outlook and Lync on Remote Desktop. I've uninstalled Office and Reinstalled but am holding off on patching office for awhile. My issues are fixed. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ran into this today. Got fix from Microsoft. Could be affecting alot of networks.

Hi Everyone,

Recently weve received several reports on two related issues for Office 2013 apps. If your Office installation is MSI-based version 15.0.4787.1001, or Click-to-Run version 15.0.4787.1002, you may get the errors below.  
1. System Error - The program cant start because davclnt.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. - Primary thread
2. "Sorry, something went wrong while trying to obtain a shared computer license for XXX, Error Code: 0xc004f014 "  Primary thread
  
We are working on a fix for the issue (No ETA on this). Before the fix is ready, please install the Desktop Experience feature as a workaround. See this article for information about installing the Desktop Experience.We will provide an update at the primary threads above once the fix is released. You can subscribed to the threads to get the most recent information.

If you are experiencing a similar issue with a different error message, please let us know by starting a new thread as this may indicate either a scoping issue or an independent problem.

	<TEXT> I'm about to restore this server from backup, but just curious if anyone else has seen this. 

Basically I have a server that is in VMware. From the console of this server I can ping external and internal devices. No problem. However I can't seem to accept connections to this server. Ex ping and RDP don't work. ( Windows firewall is definitely turned off)

I've tried recreating the nic in VMware. Resetting the ip stack as well as changing the ip itself on the server.  
I've never seen anything like it. Google searches all say it's Windows firewall related but I've triple checked this. All zones are turned off. I also do not have any 3rd party software firewalls installed. I'd also like to note that this server was working fine a week ago with no changes. ( it is running Forefront in a dmz) I've checked the settings there as well nothing has changed. I've even tried putting the server on the local lan and turning off all forefront services to no avail. 

Tldr: server can access all things but all things can't access server.  </TEXT>
