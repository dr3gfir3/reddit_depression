	<TEXT> lol again, you admit it is trumped up charges and you even admit you cant prove any crime here. 

I dont dispute that 10-20 people took actions that constitute as breaking the law. in most cases they didnt even commit felonies but misdemeanors. Maybe 5 people committed felonies that day, and in most cases they would give 4-5 of them the option to plead to a misdemeanor. Maybe 2 of these people being charged would normally be charged with felonies in this situation and that is a big maybe. This would hold true even in the most backward regressive southern state, and much more so for DC. 

Your only defense at this point is point to an actual crime that maybe 5 different people committed and then justify this charade by saying *but they wore black*. 

That is why America and the world is shocked with this. Furthermore, 99% of these people will be committed since they are innocent, but they are going to have to spend money and time to fight when they are obviously innocent as punishment for making Trump butthurt. 

What you are defending is injustice, and you know it. 

If it were up to Trump he would have thrown everyone who protest him into jail, but not even the GOP would support that, although they have tried to make protesting illegal before. So they do the next best thing, find someone breaking the law and use it as an excuse to charge everyone that is within 1km of them protesting with the same crime.

I mean if you can get a whole team together that are friends, that can be fun but usually I prefer single player. Granted I dont play a lot of FPS games or RTS, which seem to be best at MP.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol, per your own statement there are 2 people possible guilty of felonies which are usually brought down to misdemeanors. 

Ever single instance you can name shows 3 people maybe should be charged. 

So as we can see hundreds of people are being charged for felonies when you admit and your own sources show they were not involved in any rioting or doing anything illegal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol, maybe 3 people committed felonies, and maybe 10 misdemeanors. People are just being harrassed for peacefully protesting on trumped up charges. 

As you admit there is no precedent for this. Basically if someone is rioting and people are peacefully protesting per your logic they are guilty of rioting and can have their lives ruined. This isnt legal in any way, it is just a Trump backed witch hunt as democracy degrades. They even tried to charge journalist with felonies for covering this. This is BS and you know it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You mean mass charging hundreds of people with felonies for being close to a very few people who may have committed very minor felonies, but almost always would be charged with misdemeanors, is not normal? 

This whole thing is highly odd and unprecedented for decades, and the fact that they are charging felonies with people who were in the general area makes it all the more stronger.  

This is clearly Trump influencing things behind the scenes because he is butthurt they ruined his inauguration.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> idk, 

here are other capital cities for comparison, note as of 2013 density was believed to be 10528 (probably a little higher now):


London 14k

Madrid 14k

Berlin 11k

Brasilia 1.5k

Ottawa 900

Astana 4100

Riga 5800

Stockholm 9300

Amsterdam 12100



As we see DC is bigger than many of these and not too smaller than most of these. I mean yeah compared to really crowded cities like Manila, Beijing, Tokyo (basically any East Asian capital), India, it is small. But for a capital it seems pretty standard. Life in those mega crowded cities isnt great either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> not true. He read communist literature as a teenager and started out as a communist organizer and a bano robber for the communist cause. That is why Lenin took him on, the old Bolsheviks were all middle or upper class bohemian types, whereas Stalin was working class, and actually could connect with them and lead them. He had real cred. 

He also wrote several books on communism and studied it extensively.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> USSR would not have lasted under Trotsky for what you said. USSR was a mess. The people sufferred WWI, a civil war, than famine. He would have devoted what little they had to picking fights with more powerful stable countries. Likely all of Russia's neighbors would have united against Russia which would not have the resources or ability to really defend itself, and the people would likely have revolted since communism at this point was a promise *things have sucked, and they will get worse, but I promise they will get better eventually*, that doesnt work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> probably would have collapsed. 

Trotsky was an idealist who believed in communism like IS believes in islamism. He wanted to not focus on rebuilding the USSR which suffered WWI, a civil war, and famine but to ask people to take the revolution to Europe which likely would have united against them. The result probably would have been USSR being beseiged by all its neighbors and the people of the USSR throwing a counter revolution </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stalin appointed many of them. 

Lenin basically made Stalin the most powerful person in the USSR. Nobody wanted to manage the bureaucracy, all these old Bolsheviks were philosophers. They liked to debate ideology and pass bills for ideology. They didnt want to run boring bureaucracy so Stalin volunteered to do it and he built the USSR around him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> likely USSR would have collapsed. Stalin beat Trotsky by using common sense. 

USSR was a mess. Trotsky felt they needed to expand the resolution and spend what little resources they had to try and make western Europe, especially Germany Communist. USSR has recently gotten out of WWI, with great loss, and went through a civil war with great loss. After civil war there were famines. 

Instead of improving things for people in USSR he would have asked them to sacrifice more to antagonize more powerful western states. 

The west would have united against the USSR which was a mess at this time and crushed it, and the people of the USSR would have revolted against the communist. 

Stalin was not an isolationist. He believed that the USSR needed to be rebuilt first and made powerful, and then they could expand communism. This made way more sense, and it literally worked. When Stalin died a huge % of the world was communist or leaning toward communism.  </TEXT>

I mean Simon Cowell may not be Gordon Ramsay good, but with a little experience, dedication, and research there is a recipe that is going to be good that almost anyone can make.

	<TEXT> Fine feel free to reject the facts. That is a personal problem. You are hardly unique in ignoring the truth when it doesn't reach a conclusion you like. You only hurt yourself and doesn't concern me. 

And for the record the massive amounts of slavery is the worst thing about dubai. Even if it wasn't a slave state it would still suck. It is what you get if Trump could build a city. Lots of money, and no culture/sophistication/taste just gaudy showing off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I showed you a source showing dubai was and still is all built in slavery. You just said *I don't like the sources so I won't believe them*. The climate denial or the anticreationist tactic won't work here. Your opinion is noted but you have the facts. Either refute them with a source, and showing the high number of slaves in dubai is helping my point. 

If you can't do this there is nothing to discuss.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are just making excuses to ignore the slavery in dubai. 

Furthermore that was the most dishonest attempt to whitewash the slavery in dubai I've ever seen. You basically got data foe the UAE and claimed the UAE was just dubai. Firstly UAE slavery levels are high as it is, due to dubai. There isn't 10 million in dubai and you know that. Ironically you proved my point as slavery is so bad in one city it makes the whole country look bad </TEXT>

And your source proves my point UAE is bad enough but that is for whole UAE and it is real high. It's all in dubai. If dubai was a country it would be #1.
