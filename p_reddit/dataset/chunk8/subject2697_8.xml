	<TEXT> As someone who is currently watching the series, he really wouldn't. He's intelligent and well-spoken, and would have been good before his MS manifested, but he lied to the public, orchestrating a conspiracy, to conceal the fact that he has MS. There is an episode where he can't remember something that just happened in the Situation Room. He should have been impeached and removed from office. 

He also assassinates Sharif without due process in an operation that began while he was on U.S. soil. Also, he has his speech writers dictating actual policy and never punishes or fires his staff for major fuck ups, but does accept Leo's resignation when they disagree on one issue. 

He's a very okay and entertaining President on television, but he wouldn't be great in real life. 

You know who would be good though? Matt Santos.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Professor Epstein, 

What is your opinion on the Supreme Court decision in *Ledell Lee v. Arkansas*? More specifically:

Do you think it is within three bounds of due process to allow Arkansas to execute seven individuals in such a short period simply because the drug is expiring (and against the express desire of the manufacturer)? 

Do you believe that this decision fits with the precedent established in *Atkins v. Virginia* given that Mr. Lee may have been intellectually disabled? 

On a completely separate note, do you believe that when damages are awarded against the government in a case and Congress enacts a law preventing it from appropriating to paying out above a certain amount in that class of litigation, that this is an unconstitutional Taking? Especially if Congress provides no indication it will amend that legislation to allow future payments on that class of lawsuits. How would one resolve the political question issues? What are the Separation of Powers issues implicated by Congress refusing to comply with a court order to pay in such a case? 

Thank you for your time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But you are the one confusion things, murder was a word before the US was even a thing. 

Yeah, with a legal definition. Murder is a legal concept. 

So basically you appropriate a word, give it a different meaning, and then complain people use it the way they have for a 1000 years. If you wanted to use a word for state-sanctioned murder, invent a new one.  

We have a word for state-sanctioned murder, it's called the death penalty or state-sponsored/legal execution.  </TEXT>

There's enough misunderstanding about the law as it is due to colloquial understanding, confusing people when they see certain decisions as it is. Might as well get the information out there.   </TEXT>

We self police it so hard because, in part, our profession depends on it to ensure our clients trust us (similar to doctors). While I agree P.E.'s also have a strict ethical code that they follow due to their professionalism and safety risk if they don't, engineering will exist as a profession even if ethical rules aren't strictly followed. Same with medicine. With law, it's hard to say.  </TEXT>

On Monday, the courts rejected a series of appeals by Mr. Jones and Mr. Williams, including an effort minutes before Mr. Williamss execution arguing it would be unconstitutionally cruel, based on complications Mr. Jones might have experienced. In a court filing, Mr. Williamss lawyers wrote that infirmary workers had tried unsuccessfully to insert a central line in Mr. Joness neck for 45 minutes, before placing it elsewhere on his body. Then Mr. Jones gulped for air during the execution, the filing said, evidence of continued consciousness. </TEXT>

But, as an attorney who actually works on these things, I have to work with the hand I'm dealt, not some ideal that I wish were the case. 

by your version of "due process" anyone murdered by the state who was innocent received their full constitutional rights regardless of any malfeasance or fraud, so long as everyone agrees to the malfeasance and/or fraud.

Actually, yes you can. It's called prosecutorial discretion. Probably the most recent example you'd know of would be the Justice Department under Obama issuing guidance to not pursue marijuana offenders vigorously (mileage varied). 

Of course, if you don't prosecute for a blatant crime, you'll get fired. But still.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AttorneyRandall Wilhite said at a pretrial hearing in Austin last week that evaluating Jones based on his on-air comments is like judging Jack Nicholson based on his role as the Joker in Batman.

But Kelly Jones described her ex-husband as not a stable person, according to the Austin American-Statesman (http://atxne.ws/2pGyXLz). She said he is threatening toward others, noting homophobic comments hes made about Democratic U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff and a challenge to fight actor Alec Baldwin. He broadcasts from home, she said, and that exposes their children to his incendiary behavior.

The difference is, everyone is aware they're watching a movie when they see Nicholson's Joker. They're not aware that Alex Jones is "acting" when listening to him or reading his shitty website. Also, it's not fucking performance art, he's convincing real people to believe some crazy lies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They've got their reasons, albeit they're shitty. Basically, Turkey doesn't believe they're responsible for it because it technically occurred before the creation of the modern Turkish state and because the word genocide didn't exist when it occurred, so it would be ex post facto. This is significant because genocide is a war crime punishable by international law. Turkey doesn't want to mea culpa for a war crime they believe they didn't do. 

Of course they could call it a genocide and blame it on the government that committed the atrocity, but I guess it's just sort of stuck now. Note that Turkey doesn't really deny it happened, just that it's a genocide.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never said you *need* a conductor. They're just not useless. Every band has someone taking the lead. Smaller ensembles might use the drummer or have the singer set the rhythm and tempo, but you don't just sit there and play mindlessly. There's a degree of focus and coordination that needs to happen that's much more difficult when you're part of a large section playing a similar part. The conductor just makes the process easier by delegating the role to one person. It could just as easily be the soloist. But there's always someone in some form of a conductor role, even if that person is also an instrumentalist. 

For example, with your orchestra or band, I imagine that you all didn't spontaneously decide to start playing. Someone led you. That's your conductor until the conductor shows up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Conductors also control section volume and shape the way the music sounds as a whole. They also set the style. No one musician can do that independently while being a part of the orchestra because you'd have a large number of people interpreting the music in whatever way they feel, which will sound off. The conductor is the person at the mixing board making sure the levels are correct and the various inputs are layered properly, largely because a conductor can hear it all better than anyone in the orchestra. 

If you play to a metronome only, you're going to have a very boring orchestra. It'll sound fine, but it won't be interesting. The conductor adds style.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a limit to this as well. If your kid needs a place to live and has generally been a good person, cosign on the apartment lease. For many young people just starting out, before that first paycheck, it's a little hard to secure a place. Cosigning, assuming the kid has his or her shit together, is not a bad thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, but shit's law. It's based on stare decisis. I don't morally like Snyder v. Phelps but I understand why it happened. It's also stare decisis and a fairly important piece of first amendment legislation. But it also says that you can protest a soldier's funeral. Similarly, I don't morally agree with Citizens but it does have a (albeit shitty) logic for them. The solution to citizens is gonna end up being Congress, not the Court.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it kinda can't be. The law changed. Per the law at the time, Dredd Scott, unfortunately, made sense. Dredd Scott concerned the then-constitutional Fugitive Slave Clause. Supreme Court can't declare a part of the Constitution unconstitutional. That doesn't make any sense. 

Like I said, it's morally wrong, but the power to overturn it came from Congress, not the Court.  </TEXT>
