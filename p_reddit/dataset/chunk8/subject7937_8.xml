	<TITLE> Looking for a cheap way to mix the audio on my iPad via bluetooth with the audio on my PC via 3.5mm to my bluetooth headphones. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-19 00:42:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> At work I have my iPad playing video podcasts all day long and i listen to it via cheap bluetooth headphones but there are times where I need to hear my computer's audio as well (mail notifications, inner-office chat notifications, watching randomly linked youtube videos etc.).

Right now I have a separate pair of wired headphones that go directly into the motherboard - I don't have speakers and I don't want speakers so I don't disturb anyone around me. 

My question is: is there a cheap mixer that will receive my iPad's audio via bluetooth and transmit it to my bluetooth headphones while mixing my desktop's audio? 

If there is one, will my bluetooth headphone's buttons still work?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

I don't want to spend a bunch of money on a car I'll only drive another year. I figured since I already had this interface I could kinda hack together a bluetooth solution - I've used three different FM transmitters but as I drive around the "empty frequencies" become live frequencies and there's a ridiculous amount of interference forcing me to always change the station.

Any other suggestions? </TEXT>

the original cable is an old 30pin Apple dock (alternatively, could I use a 30pin-to-3.5mm with a female-to-female coupler to connect to a bluetooth receiver's aux jack?) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there's really nothing to it, answered this a bunch of times in the comments:

I took three bearings, used "jb weld" to glue them together. I put the three bearings with the glue horizontally in a vice to make sure it sets straight. I bought two knurled Screws (Stainless 6-32x7/16) and Knurled Nuts (Brass 6/32), and sawed off the screw so that it'd sit flush with the nut when screwed in. You'll have to check and make sure the nuts and screws fit the bearings you bought. After it sets, screw in the nuts and you're good to go! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> after putting the adhesive on it, i pressed it flat on the table and then flipped a vice upsidedown and pinched it with the vice horizontally making sure it's perfectly straight. i tightened it and dabbed a bit more to reinforce the bond. let it set about 2hrs and dabbed a bit more. the first one i made (shown in the gif) broke bonds when i dropped it really hard, [the pictures](http://imgur.com/a/jUvYy) i showed are after gluing it together again and then reinforced the sides. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> for me it's just a small token that I fiddle with - much like how some people carry a coin, worry-stone, or random key-chain. 

The tops and spinning coins are absolute marvels of precision and material. I really admire the craftsmanship put into each one and having something unique that I can just fiddle with outside of playing with my phone is always great. 

The precision tops/coins these days are made with some pretty exotic materials (much like fancy knives) and they spin for a crazy amount of time. 

My coin is clocked at 20min, I have other tops that have similar spin times but they're not easy to carry as they're oddly shaped. There's just something tranquil watching something spin, almost float, for an extended amount of time.

/r/PocketTops is a pretty dead community here on reddit but the Poket Top Talk group on facebook is very active if you're looking for more info. </TEXT>
