	<TEXT> The current police chief of a small town in Oklahoma has come out against taking property from people who haven't been convicted of any crime. The article also goes into great detail over the fight to reform that state's forfeiture laws and cites cases of abuse (e.g. a prosecutor used forfeiture money to pay off student loans, while another lived in a seized drug house).  </TEXT>
