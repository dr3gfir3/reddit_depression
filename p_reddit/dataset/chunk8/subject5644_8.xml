	<TEXT> On last year's promo I noticed Mike walking in the background and not really being that visible and [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/49v889/ever_notice_mike_in_the_background_of_the_bcs/) about it. I'm guessing that they're doing the same here. Good 'ol Vince and his easter eggs. </TEXT>
