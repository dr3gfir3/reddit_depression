Here's the Cliff Notes all according to True Master...

True Master was charged with escape after his arrest. He claims that he was escorted by an officer through 4 different corridors and released. He went home and there were police patrolling outside of his house because they broke the door earlier to arrest him. He saw the police and they saw him. He left and came back and saw them again. When word got out that he had escaped, those officers rearrested him and put it in their report that he did not look like he was trying toflee. Later on, that police report was changed to say that he was seen trying to sneak back into his house by hopping a fence in to the back. Also, the video footage that would have shown whether he was released or if he escaped was mysteriously deleted and no longer exists.

His DNA, saliva or semen were never found on/in the woman. She claims he put his hand in her with KY and that must have acted like a glove preventing DNA from being left behind. It was never tested for KY by the prosecution. Once True Master was acquitted, he paid to have it tested and there was no KY found in the sample.

She claimed while she was fighting him off, he dropped a wine glass and it broke. They prosecution said that they never tested the glass for fingerprints. After he was aquitted, True Master paid to have the glass fingerprinted. Not only were his fingerprints not found on the broken glass, the independent lab found materials on the glass that proved the prosecution HAD tested the glass for fingerprints and when they didn't find his, they lied to cover it up.


The escape charge was thrown out and he was found not guilty of the sodomy charge (forcing her to blow him), but he could be retried for attempted rape (penetrating her vagina) and unlawful imprisonment charges because they were declared a mistrial because the jury was deadlocked and one of the jurors was going on vacation and couldn't serve any longer.

	<TEXT> Extra details: i pose this question because im a member of a popular hip-hop forum and my focus recently has been on music, its discussion, what can make it better etc. (my discussion has gone up to 30,000 posts/threads just discussing music). However it isnt the one all be all. I guess what im trying to say is how do i redirect my focus to having meaningful discussion on other topics, even though hip-hop is my passion. </TEXT>
