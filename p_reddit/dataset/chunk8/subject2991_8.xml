	<TEXT> Knead it now tonight, and knead it more than ever.

Knead until it's smooth, then keep going till it's stretchy, then keep going a bit more! Till you can make a window pane out of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Didn't really follow one, I made a starter using 200g strong flour, 20ml water and sachet of instant yeast. Let that proof over night.

Next day added another sachet of yeast, more flour and water until I could ply the dough (probably 300g flour) and salt.

Knead till super stretchy, proof an hour, make in to bagel shapes, proof again for half an hour, boil two minutes in water with dark brown sugar then bake at 220c for 20mins. </TEXT>
