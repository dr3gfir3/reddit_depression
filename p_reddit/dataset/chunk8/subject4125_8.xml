	<TEXT> Not quite sure I follow your question, but I think the answers is: not many. 

As this related article explains (https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e21506), the parasites are found in sub-Saharan African, mostly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. So they're extremely unlikely to be responsible for forms of skin inflammation that happen around the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that's known yet.

The research looked at *Trypanosoma* *brucei* *gambiense* and Chaga's is caused by a different species (*Trypanosoma* *cruzi*). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sleeping sickness is just a more common name for the infection caused by the parasites. It's more formal name is Human African trypanosomiasis.

This related article puts the findings into a wider context and also explains the reasoning behind the common name. https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e21506

In chronic infections, the parasites can also cross the blood-brain barrier and cause a number of potentially fatal neurological disorders, including the disrupted sleep patterns that give the disease its common name.
