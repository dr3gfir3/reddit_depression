	<TITLE> According to general relativity, if I went 99.9% the speed of light to the nearest star and back, I would age roughly 8.5 years. But thousands would pass on earth. How can that be, when as an observer on earth, we would see the ship leave and then return 8.5 years later? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Science Fiction - Fortunes's Pawn by Rachel Bach (and the rest of the Paradox trilogy). It's not very well known but I thought it was fantastic. I read the entire trilogy in a week. 

Shout out to Classics as well. East of Eden is my all time favorite/life changing book. I had to read it slowly so that I could think on every sentence Steinbeck penned. Pure literary perfection, IMHO.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm surprised no one has mentioned www.betterworldbooks.com They sell used books (most are ex library books) for an average of $3 per book. Most are really nice hardcovers. And for every book you buy, they donate one to various charities. 

Edit: They also offer FREE shipping on every order whether it's one book or 100.  </TEXT>
