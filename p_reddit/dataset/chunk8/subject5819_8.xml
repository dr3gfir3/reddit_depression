	<TEXT> It basically boils down to risk/reward with respect to kill output. Rocket launchers are low risk/low reward with respect to the number of kills you can get, generally 1 per rocket. LMGS are high risk/high reward since they require a riskier play-style to maximize, but can generate much more kills as a result (upwards of 10 or more with the right set of circumstances). After loads of pvp, I tend to switch around to whatever fits my mood. Since the changes to heavy ammo Rocket launchers aren't nearly as insane as before so it feels more balanced out. If I'm feeling lazy, Truth does werrrrrrk, otherwise Jolder's it is </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Came here to back you on this. This statement is simply not true, its a 3 second countdown to turn invis once you stop moving, this technique does nothing to make it go faster or reduce the silent cooldown. OP must have just had confirmation bias for doing an animation and crouching at the same time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> RNGesus blessed me with my first Vex mytho, a solid roll on an alternate raid helm, TL from the exotic chest, and exotic shards for days in the nightfalls. I now know what guys who have enlarged prostates feel like when they finally get the chance to empty their bladders. </TEXT>
