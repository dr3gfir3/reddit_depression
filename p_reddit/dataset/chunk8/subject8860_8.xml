	<TEXT> Is Thing in the Ice not a good card or did everyone just forget? Honest question, it seems like exactly what you want in here both as additional threats and stuff to fight from behind.

This gives you:  

TNN : mongoose impersonation  
Thing in the ice: goyf impersonation  
delver:  delver impersonation 

Then cantrips and counterspells. If you want reach and you're really desperate, 

Psionic blast  

If you want Swords to plowshares, I guess you have "options" (shudders)

Spontanious Mutation  
Mind Harness
Pongify(for the sake of completion.)

Maybe an actual delver player can weigh in here, IDK. Does Mauseleum wanderer count as a threat for example? If so that may lower the curve, if you even want to do that.

step 3 : dog is unkillable with current weapon, I die to everything else while i swing at it. 

for reference, I'm almost dying to the three dogs outside.

Does the tail have any sort of health regen? I had 250 arrows and ran out of arrows because I couldnt hit the guy from where you are talking about.   Shot them all and hit maybe 11-12 times. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Imagine you want to cast a spell, so you press the button to do so. after a delay of about a little less than a second*, your spellcaster begins her startup animation. Now stuck like that, you need to "queue up" the direction in which you wish to dodge or walk or whatever, anticipating what the enemy is going to do next.

 Under these conditions, It feels like precision is impossible and skill of excecution is irrelevant. I have to play this like a turn based game almost, planning out the next few inputs in advance. I start to beat bosses only when Ive gotten good enough at a certain part of their pattern to be able to take that time to plan instead of react or dodge or whatever.

 Not to say this isn't extremely fun in its own way , I'm just hoping that it's sustainable.

 I've had to put some into strength to ensure I can even keep up. Magic is really really hit or miss.

 might be less than that, I just know I can say "Dracozombie" before my character reacts to a button press, so some predictive reasoning is pretty neccesary.

Sorry, looks like no such thing as offensive play here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Miracles obv, opposing nic fit, taxes, aluren has 4 basics, multiple painter decks, burn, pox.

Nic fit goes over some of these, but not Mud, 12 post, lands, turbo depths, etc.

usually not much delver, the delver players tend to be the miracles players, and guess what they would rather sleeve up?

Please note how bad sigarda is against most of this. No one really cares about my 5/5 for five, I'll board it in when i need it thanks.  

edit: this is also why the deck needs to function without a vet, Its because vet is just a bad card some abnormally significant amount of the time, so I'm leaning on the decks ability to grind and go slightly larger. I'd just lose the game if i cast titans or whatever. That's why the deck looks the way it does.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Playing a spellcaster type build, mostly because I was told by a friend that it would be easier to do that for my first run. 

When it works it's great, but for almost every boss fight I end up having to can the magic, pull out my dorky sword, and get to chopping. Actually, i have to do this with all the knights too. I just pullout my catalyst and immediately get canned.

It seems like magic is just a quality of life thing here, to get you through most of the normal encounters in the game, but the normal encounters are getting much harder. I'm at the ghost/flooded city.

Full disclosure: I'm playing on PC, without dsfix, with a 10 meter cable hooked to my tv, on my Ps4 controller. No other setup has worked for me, I don't know how to touchtype well and dsfix doesn't seem to work with any sort of "PS controller on PC" software. The  TV makes up for visibility deficencies.
I realize this is not ideal.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If cutting explorer is wrong, Nic fit is unplayable in my meta. Thers just too many matchups where saccing vet is better for my opponent than for me here, especially game 2-3.

Also, the reason why I ended up cutting top for library is because I ran top for a while and then cut one for a library. library ended up being way better, so i cut another for another and finally removed top entirely.

Path just isnt a flexible enough spell for the aforementioned reasons. People have more basics than I do  around here a fair amount of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to assume that the mana is fine, because if it isn't nothing else I say matters.

I'm going to further assume that cards with double of a single color are almost as hard to cast here as in either tezz variant.

Every time i go to say something about this deck being terrible, I take another pass over it and realize that yes, there is synergy there, and yes, you did think about this. So 2 constructive pieces of criticism:

First don't just  think of walkers as walkers, but things that hit the board and accrue card advantage over time, while also being a win condition. keranos, trading post, and thopter spy network all qualify, but I'm absolutely positive i'm not thinking of some.

Second,  If you can make space for chalice in the main, do so. Theres no downside except lack of space, and doing so overloads your opponents removal/ blanks it. You might not need the full four with trinisphere there though.

Actually, assuming this works at a basic level, This deck seems right up my alley. Too bad I don't own mox opal. Maybe modern masters 2017 will have it and that will be my chance.

Maybe they ban it in modern. Hopefully not both, that would be poor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which is what i said, except I probably wouldn't mull this.

I mean, this hand is totally servicable on its face, but a mull to five has to not draw karakas or plains or stronghold or whatever other utility lands you may run. No non GX land works, remember.

Actually I can't imagine a mull to five getting the plan online without a lot of help. Maybe if you just have the nut?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wasteland draws cards with gitrog, makes gouys with titania, and Yeah, you can get your opponent with knight i guess.

Sigarda always makes my 75, but not always my 60.

Scryb ranger is less about the untap and more about the ramp and land rebuy, It has synergy with tracker, knight, and deathrite. could still be subpar here, but thats to be seen.

You''re probably right about truths, will keep second tracker in mind.

I'll make space for nissa, peviously was ob nixilis slot, then sorin 6, then got cut.

I'm gonna be honest, I hate that top costs mana. when i played it, i had multiple games where I lost because i had to pay mana for top to find something and promptly lost to daze or pierce.

There is a plan for miracles: generate value off all your threats, only deploy 1-2 creatures at a time, make them play around depths/ stage kill you and titania/ safekeeper kill you.  That being said, if i can find space for sigarda, ill play it. Gitrog may get the axe, not sure yet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah this whole thing is for the specific situation i mentioned, which definitly comes up.

I also didn't say anything about 1 landers, I said this is what happens if your hand has 2 lands and one doesn't make green or black mana. Consider:

mull to six on draw:  
verdant catacombs    
karakas  
cabal therapy  
Gsz  
siege rhino  
path  

you could replace Gsz with vet, or path with decay, or rhino with some decent 3 drop, or add a deed to make 7 cards. It doesn't matter that much, if you don't find land your line is pretty clear.

	<TEXT> Hi guys, strongly considering coming back, but My list from before may need an update. This is what I had:

Lands: 23   
4 Verdant catacombs  
4 windswept heath  
2 swamp  
2 forest  
1 plains  
1 savannah  
1 bayou  
1 scrubland  
1 karakas  
1 dark depths  
1 thespian stage  
1 volraths stronghold  
1 phyrexian tower    
2 wasteland  
 
creatures: 19    
3 deathrite shaman   
3 veteran explorer   
1 sylvan safekeeper    
1 quasali pridemage  
1 scavenging ooze    
1 reclamation sage   
1 tireless tracker  
2 knight of the reliquary  
3 seige rhino    
1 The gitrog monster  
1 Titania, protector of argoth  

spells: 18  
3 pernicious deed  
2 sylvan library  
3 abrupt decay  
1 abzan charm 
4 cabal therapy    
1 painful truths
4 GSZ     
 

The cards i'm intrested in:

grim flayer( historically junk has had bad  2 drops, this might be okay)
New nissa(is exactly on plan)  
3 drop GW guy that gets your thing back    
Scryb ranger(does a lot for this deck)  
More painful truths  

Space is always tight. What do you guys think? I'd start by cutting pulse, but idk. 

edit: forgot green sun's zenith like a putz. Fixing that now.

	<TEXT> You need to therapy turn one if you plan on using veteran explorer on turn 2 though, because you need to play around STP.

To actually answer the question asked, the answer to this question really depends on the rest of your hand. If your hand is disruptive, brainstorm is fine. If you are low on threats that don't immediately generate value, you need to name a removal spell. If your threats generate value,  Force of will. 

Therapy on turn one is the line you take when you have a 1-2 land hand, and one of those lands is plains or colourless. This kind of crap happens a fair bit, it turns out  when you play so many basics your mana can dump on you.

I was 80 percent or something on therapy hits, but that was early 2016 in paper magic. I'm both rusty and too unfamiliar with current lists to get that kind of rate today. Still, this advice should be sound.      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah no. It was universal shorthand for what you just described, now it is no longer *universal* shorthand for that, and has been repurposed as shorthand for what I just described by a subset of the population. 

Now you have people who can't differentiate what shorthand you want, and when you take the phrase at face value, it doesn't even mean what it says.

It's kinda like "move to combat," or an old card not doing what it says on it and the oracle text being wrong. More like the oracle text example actually, you can't really call the judge and ask if your opponent is being sincere or being sarcastic.

you know what is sincere? This exchange:

Player B loses to screw.  
Player A- "Good Game!"
Player B-" That was not a good game. The previous game was awesome, a tight uphill battle despite a mull to 5 on the play. I almost got there! This game was a disaster, and I'm actually kind of offended that you consider it a real game of magic."

This is easy to avoid! Consider:

Player B Loses
Player A - "Thx for the games, good luck in future rounds"

No ambiguity, no unnecessary additional salt.

	<TEXT> necessary steps not mentioned : Drying out the card, double sleeving after, using another curved object to reshape.

Btw, for kicks, tried what you asked using a foil ponyback rider, that card is screwed now.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're missing the point. I have no problem with the game having an art style,  *if it doesn't affect game play,* but the changes they made for clarity render the game entirely unwatchable. *I can't see anything that's going on.*

There's too much bloom so i cant see whats being shot, health bars block unit sprites, units blend into backgrounds, units are diificult to differentiate from each other sometimes, and on and on.

All of this is really easy to fix, just make a mod and change some values. I'd do it myself, except *I can't even evaluate the gameplay by watching the game if I can't see said game.*

I posted what i posted both because the reaction is "blame relic" instead of " blame the art guys lack of relevant experience."

I know dawn of war 3 is different from dawn of war 2. Guess what?

Starcraft 2, warcraft 3, meridian new world, orcs and humans, *dune freaking two* do not have this set of problems.

This is a problem set created by the sort of person who does not think their art decisions all the way through, and does not have employees with previous expertise making art decisions to call upon.

So not only am I not buying this game, I'm double checking to make sure these two are not making art decisions on the next RTS game before I buy that one. 

I want to see these guys have learned their lesson about "clarity"
before I buy anything they touch.

	<TEXT> The way you explained it doesn't even solve the problem.

Whatever, I've been told i have to dry out the card and curve it the other way agianst a cup or something.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if  sylvius is watching: 
first remember aluren is symmetrical. that means that on shanes combo turn, you had two redraws to force.
For sideboarding, 3 sphere stops his combo cold, and cursed totem shuts off deathrite. Mana denial is even better agianst him than it is against you, so in comes the sideboard wasteland.

Honestly, i think this match comes down to you trying to leverage the virtual card advantage created by chalice coupled with the fact that every non mana card you have is usally worth two.

Shane just wants to kill your rocks and deny you mana. If you get to take more than 2 game actions per turn,
the game is over.

In game one, the clock is the same whether you plus or you minus, except that you get extra cards if you plus your tezz.

In game 2 i honestly would have sacced the chalice earlier, perhaps the previous turn. Transmute for sword is a serious out, and the way tranmute works, you wouldnt even need to pay the difference.

all in all though a good showing of the strenghts and weaknesses of blue black tezzerator. The reason why i run the grixis build is because the mana is actually better, due to the lack of double U cards and the presence of mox diamond. The curve is also lower and more interaction exists.

UB casts force better and has slightly better walkers.Except daretti. Daretti is so often the reason games are won.

	<TEXT>  I'm telling you my card is bent, and I'm asking you how to straighten it? Step by step if possible? 

Bending the card back with my hands the way I'm thinking would put a permanent crease in the card and would not even fix the problem, so I know I have it wrong.

Right now, I'm at "play something else in the slot."

	<TEXT> Okay, fair enough. It seemed like you were unaware that certain postgame rituals don't mean what they used to mean anymore.

For the record, offering the hand isn't one of them. I'm just saying, careful what you say when you do it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bought  breya for my legacy deck at my local game store, took public transit home and by the time I arrived, the card was warped to have the same curvature as my thermos. 

I put it between two textbooks for 3 days and nothing happened.

Wizards, please ensure there are nonfoil versions of every card going forward, Foil Breya is not a tournament legal card.

Thank you.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It can however be a dick move to call at game good when it is nothing of the sort.

It also does not help that good game has become the shorthand for "I win" or "I'm going to win" or "You can't win from this position" depending on when you say it.

Streamers saying "I think this is gg guys" exemplifys this fact, and paints the "pony league handshake" as a dying relic of a previous age, twisted and weaponized by online personalities with no respect for the fact that they play against a person, and if that person could hear their side of the screen they would  consider this "faux sportmanship" rude.

Saying "good game" when one person didn't cast spells is incredibly insincere at best. You might as well let your voice drip with sarcasm.    </TEXT>
