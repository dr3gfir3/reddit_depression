My mom constantly complains and yells at every one for everything, big or small. Last weekend, she complained about how the ice trays weren't refilled for like 20 mins, then escalated that to how everyone was lazy and she was the only one responsible for an hour. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've been best friends for a pretty long time. We'd hang out all over the place. Every place that we would go, you would hit on all the girls and surprisingly, get every girls number. I never understood how you could be this great with women. So when you told me you were gay, I was really surprised but also very accepting. You told me that you felt like this for a long time and it made you feel like less of a human for holding back so much of who you were supposed to be. It didn't matter to me, you were my best friend and it didn't matter whether you were straight, gay, or bisexual, I knew how good of a person you were. Then came graduation. I was going off to college and you, I wasn't so sure what you wanted to do with your life. We spent almost two years apart, barely speaking to each other as time went by. Last week, I decided to message you on Facebook, (You changed your number without telling me) and I wanted to get some friends and I to come to your house so we could all catch up. We agreed to meet up in two weeks because of all of our busy schedules. "Cool." but before I could say, 'see ya later' you told me you were on hormones and said that you were becoming a woman. When you told me this, I was first shocked and then confused, I didn't know what to say. You started to tell me to call you a girls name and stop calling you, 'bud' or 'buddy' but to be completely honest, I'm not ready to do that. I'm not comfortable with your decision. I understand that you wanted this, and i'm not going to make you feel bad in anyway. It will take time for me to accept all of this. But right now, I just don't know what to think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just had binge days. It was pretty irregular. I remember the first time I watched One Piece. I watched 12 episodes the first day. I also remember the day when I woke up, started watching Op and didn't stop until night. Surprisingly I wasn't dehydrated at all. I'd say it took me 3 months all in all to catch up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. It's a weird feeling really. You never really notice a certain girl all that much and then something happens that allows both of you to talk. You realize she's really nice and once you're done talking, you feel pretty happy that you talked to her. You end up thinking about it a little more often then one should and during that time, you think about all the great things you noticed about her. Then for some reason you just form a crush. 

This has happened to me plenty times. I don't know if our problems are the same but I realized that the reason why I formed a crush on every girl I met was because I didn't really have much of a social life. I honestly just wanted more human interaction in my life. If this isn't the reason then I wouldn't call you desperate, I think that maybe you should just start looking for a girlfriend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I respect the wrestlers for being on the road for so long and performing, but to me it isn't a sport. It's more like a circus act. Mainly because of the story. Also the story is almost always the same. However this is not the reason why I dislike it. The fans, not all but some, are annoying. My brother watches WWE and never stops talking about it. I encounter other people that watch WWE and they're just as annoying. I mention any other sport like boxing or mma and get complained at. </TEXT>
