	<TITLE> Where to get signed books? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm wanting to get a signed copy of pretty much anything by Clive Barker, and with my luck I'm not going to accidentally stumble upon anything that cool, so is there a site anyone uses or just any good recommendations? I'd also really like to get a signed copy of Swan Song by Robert McCammon. And I guess anything by Stephen King...Murakami, probably a whole bunch of ppl.

Give me tips and suggestions or just show off your treasures. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done this with 3 different books.

Flowers for Algernon

The Handmaids Tale

The Haunting of Hill House

I liked Flowers for Algernon best, it's up there for favorite books of all time. Hill House was...ok.

The Handmaids Tale I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would and read it mainly because I didn't want it spoiled by everyone talking about it....though the way people talk about it makes me think, they either didn't read it, or didn't understand what it was saying, because the book, despite what everyone plays it out to be, it was not a feminist agenda based book, which I thought it was going to be. But, that's as much as I'll say because, Reddit is Reddit and yeah.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Imajica is like 850 pages broken up into 2 books, The Fifth Dominion and The Reconciliation, I think you're referring to the second half of the book.

https://www.amazon.com/Reconciliation-Imajica-Book-2/dp/0061094153


What I read has both in there

	<TEXT> I've only read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and I really liked that, I haven't thought about trying anything else by him recently except maybe the book they made Total Recall from, and Minority Report.

	<TEXT> What a trip, what an amazing amazing fantastical ride that was. I'm just in awe as to what were on those pages. 

This book took me way longer to finish than I wanted it to, and there were parts that dragged a little too long, but those last couple chapters, they just made it all worth it and I almost had tears in my eyes when Pie takes Gentle off into the world of spirits. I know this isn't going to be a book that many will read, but those who have read it, lemme know what you thought.

Also Ease was my favorite character by far though he had such a small role, and even Dowd and Sartori tug at the heart strings when there parts ended. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really not a versus but, I ended picking up the first book of each of these series and I'm excited about getting into them. I have ASOIAF, Mistborn trilogy and the first 6 Dune books. So my plan was to read each see which I like best and then start to collect the rest, hopefully I'll really enjoy them all.

Right now I think Dresden Files is the one I'm most excited for, it seems like the underdog but everyone who's read it has really enjoyed it.

I'm thinking about also picking up Malazaan and Night Angel, but not sure. 

Without spoilers of you've read these which ones did you like best and are there any other series out there that you really enjoyed.  </TEXT>

So I'm reading through this today and just noticed that my cover is off, it's like it wasn't aligned correctly and should have been centered more to the right. 

Thought it was a little strange, but maybe it happens more often than not. 

Anyone else have any misprinted covers or slightly off? 

Include pictures if you have them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One book a month? I'm doing this wrong then, I'm at like a book or 2 a week.

Also I have up technology, minus Reddit every now and again, and I got rid of tv and internet and videogames and I love it. 

It sucked at first because I wanted to watch something or play something, but after awhile I just stopped caring, now I get really really bored if I'm around a tv and I can only stare at a screen long enough for a movie at the theaters which I go like one every 2 months. 

But I see everyone stuck on their phones, everywhere. </TEXT>

But yes the book is amazing, and I saw the movie first, so if you've the seen the movie just know...It's not really like that, so knowing about Mercedes isn't really that big of a thing in the book because of reasons that you'll find out if you read it...which btw it's amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine was the start of a divorce.

I wasn't much of a reader, in fact I didn't even fit into that 1 book a year category, I fit into the Netflix and videogames all the time facebooking category. But as the ex wife and I were starting to have troubles in our marriage I needed to get away from it all and I started reading. It helped me escape the pain I knew was coming and allowed me to sit and enjoy whatever last moments we were going to have together. Inevitably the divorce did eventually happen and the moving and the separation, and when we parted ways I was just done with everyone and everything, I got rid of my videogames, told her to keep the big tv and deleted my social media. I said goodbye to it all, and I read. It started slow and was tedious, but it became part of my normal day. The lessons I've learned from what I've read helped me understand better about who I am and the divorce, the way people work and think, and just made the coping easier for me. I'm at about a book or two..or three a week that I read, still no tv, still no social media, and really I just browse r/books mostly now.

So, what brought you into the world of books? </TEXT>
