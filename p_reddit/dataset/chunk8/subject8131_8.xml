 Federalism is the system of government in which power is divided between a central government and regional governments; in the United States, both the national government and the state governments possess a large measure of sovereignty.

 His teammates will continue to compete. Bart Deurloo will appear in the individual all-around final on Wednesday, while the **Flying Dutchman,** Epke Zonderland, will attempt to repeat as Olympic champion on high bar.

LOL at that nickname. That doesn't seem like a good nickname to have.

For reference from wikipedia:

 The Flying Dutchman (Dutch: De Vliegende Hollander) is a legendary ghost ship that can never make port and is doomed to sail the oceans forever. The myth is likely to have originated from 17th-century nautical folklore. The oldest extant version dates to the late 18th century. Sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries reported the ship to be glowing with ghostly light. If hailed by another ship, the crew of the Flying Dutchman will try to send messages to land, or to people long dead. In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is a portent of doom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that's why the commentator wrote the article on CNN. But I think that's certainly why CNN published it. I think CNN's line of thinking is:

- publish tone-deaf article
- tone-deafness annoys people
- annoyed tell other people about the article, and also websites report on it
- those other people and also people who view said websites view the article
- leading to the article on CNN getting more views, leading to the ads on the article's page getting more views
- CNN gets more money due to ad views
- and some people click on those ads, so CNN gets more money
- and some people who click on the ads actually buy the products/services advertised, which nets CNN more money

All in all, despite the loss of integrity for publishing such a shitty article, CNN makes money. And even though CNN advertises itself as a news site, I suspect their true motive is to make as much money as possible. Hell, most businesses are like that (profit over values), in my opinion. </TEXT>
