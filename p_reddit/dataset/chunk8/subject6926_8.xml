	<TEXT> Hello, I appreciate you checking up on me! I am doing a bit better, I recently got a new job at a hospital so it's been keeping me distracted for now :) Just saving up some money and trying to have some goals to look forward to.

Hope you have a nice day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They would honestly make a lot of profit! I just got these purely from luck, I got this vinyl from the first sweepstakes when you could send them a letter or a post card, and 5 months later I received this as a prize :) The Chloe Necklace, a friend who is an employee from DONTNOD mailed me one ^_^ Nice people they are.

I could see them not selling the soundtrack due to licensing, but they could totally sell the Necklace and the Hotdawg mug... I have no clue why they won't do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, sorry for the late reply. I've been having very rough times in my life lately that involved having PTSD from abuse and abandonment months ago, my car breaking, and having Major Chronic Depression to aid all of that. I'm trying to make my life a little better, but it just really not happening and I've been hurting myself recently...

Thank you for your concern though, I really appreciate it ^_^ </TEXT>
