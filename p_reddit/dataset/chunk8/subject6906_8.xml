	<TEXT> How the fuck were they given the opportunity to have networking and information sessions?

Multi-level marketing schemes are very similar to PYRAMID SCHEMES. ONLY the people at the top make money, while exploiting everyone else on the ground.

You have been warned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try Stony Brook U. 100K is alot of money in principal. If you take out loans all 4 years...NOT only will you owe the principal, but you'll have to pay back all of the interest that accrues during that period of time. 

Imagine making loan payments for the first 5-6 years, which only goes towards paying down interest. Then, it will take 5+ years to pay back the principal. (Just estimates, but in general it takes a while to pay off loans) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> RU is largely an in-state school. There are not many out of state students here. I'd say 1 in every 15 or so...although just an estimate. Since NJ is so small, most people that attend RU know people here already and it can get VERY cliquey VERY fast. Your best bet is to save money and stay in state. I'm sure HOFSTRA has clubs and activities as well. In your post, you basically answered your own question. I know it's a tough decision, but if HOFSTRA is giving you more money and you already know people there....that's the best decision. Not only is it in-state, but if something happens and you need to return home...it's less of loss b/c you'll already be close to home. 

The CS department is good, but it's not worth paying $37,000+ for an out of state public school.  

Good Luck!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the studio apartments in the immediate campus area are very pricey; almost as much Hoboken or JC. The best quality studios are the new ones on Sicard and 12 Barlett, but you'll pay a lot. The higher the quality, the higher the price. </TEXT>
