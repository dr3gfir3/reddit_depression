	<TEXT> I read a few of the books, and I did enjoy them at the time but I had only seen The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe movie before then. When I read the actual book I found that I actually liked the movie a lot more, which is something I almost never say. The biggest disappointment for me was how they skipped the final fight. They just went "Oh, by the way, the Witch is dead. We won. Yay!"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am an Asian Male myself and I find it pretty messed up. Some of the posts there just feel plain stupid or just trying to reinforce their own messed up points of view that every white girl is racist if they don't date an Asian guy and every Asian girl is a traitor if they date a white guy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Physics teachers are always fun. Actually, scratch that, most science teachers are actually quite fun, mostly because they think of cool experiments that work theoretically but forget most of the other problems in practice. One physics teacher burnt her Polaroid glasses trying to see how they would polarize a laser. Another one burnt a couple of plastic folders from students trying to demonstrate how insulation works with electromagnetism and ionization. The one that takes the cake though was a chemistry teacher who once had us put bits of different solid chemicals around a metal plate over a Bunsen burner to see how they melted at different temperatures. Funny thing is theoretically it would work, with the Bunsen burner in the center of a circle and the chemicals around it, it would heat all of them evenly. However, he didn't account for a few facts that made the experiment a disaster in practice. First, heating a thin metal plate only in the center probably caused it to bend slightly due to the heat difference. Second, melting a solid that way only causes the bottom of it to melt which, on a smooth metal plate, causes it to lose friction and slide down the slope of the plate towards the center of the plate where it is hottest. Third, he probably forgot that some of the chemicals might have been flammable. This ended up with the whole plate catching fire and burning some of the other chemicals, one of which was sulfur or something like that. This released a lot of smoke and probably some noxious fumes from the way it kinda made a lot of people cough. Ended up evacuating the classroom to let it air out, and then going back in to grab our stuff and just go. </TEXT>
