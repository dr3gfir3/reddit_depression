	<TEXT> I just think of deadmau5's reaction to the vocals submitted by a fan for his song The Veldt.

 That stuttering is fucking shit. It's stupid. The vocals are great but I hate the fucking stuttering effect.

The only difference is we can't fix it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I meant different from AI and 21CB. Those two are my favorite Green Day albums (21CB because it was my first) and they are very similar thanks to the motifs featured throughout the album cause...y'know...rock opera. Because of the different setup I find it difficult to compare Revrad with them. It's like comparing apples and oranges because they're both fruits and make good juice. I enjoy both, but for different reasons. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've had a busy week, but I have a few hours free tomorrow and had some time in between classes today to plan.

I have the final tracklist chosen for disc 2 and also what parts are studio/musical. I'm going to be busy from 4:30 to, like 10 tonight so I have no time to get it done tonight, *however*, I have all the time until 5pm tomorrow. Thanks to this I'll be able to edit, put it in a video, and upload it to YouTube.

I'm so sorry for the delays, but I want to be sure I can put the proper effort into this project so I can look back and say that I was proud of it. I didn't expect a bored day project to and up like this, thank you guys so much! </TEXT>

I love The Who, I love this song.

[Rush's cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILbDCAcnRF4)

Pretty good, but a bit empty in range. It's energetic and fun like everything else on this album.

	<TEXT> #***UPDATE:***

**So there's an issue with clyp.it and them...um...kinda not allowing this to be up. However, when I have time to edit the second disc (most likely by the end of this week) I will have a way so you guys can listen to it! Honestly, after being swamped with hours of homework I just want a mental break, so when I have free time I will happily make part 2. Thank you so much for your positive feedback! I'm glad it's being enjoyed how I hoped!**

So tonight I spend ~2-3 hours recutting the first part and have got it done finally. I'm *really* proud of this edit and think, personally, it floors the original edit. Thank you all so much for your constructive criticism and I hope you enjoy this second cut! The second disc should be up ~~tomorrow evening.~~ by the end of the week.

	<TEXT> I imagine it as Jimmy trying to apologize. It's the turning point where he read the letter and tried to go back but she wouldn't.

 I'm sorry I didn't take the time to feel the way I do.

This leads to Missing You where he's been trying to move on but succumbs to the fact that he needs her, leading to Wake Me Up and Homecoming where he is finally over her. However, the theme of lying to himself returns in Whatsername where it shows that he's *still* thinking about her. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> #***ANOTHER UPDATE: Because of the positive reaction, I decided to make a second edit. I should have at least part one up tonight which I'm already far more happy with than this edit. I'm pumped for you guys to hear it!***

Out of depression I decided to do a project to make an extended fan cut of American Idiot to hopefully give the album new life for me and so I could combine the actual album with songs I enjoyed from the musical as well as a couple from 21st Century Breakdown. I also made some additions for motifs that I enjoyed in the musical. The tracklist is as follows:

[online stream for disc 1](https://clyp.it/lgvqkrha)

[online stream for disc 2](https://clyp.it/ooxikwao)

Act 1:

1. Intro (The End by The Doors)
2. American Idiot
3. Jesus Of Suburbia
4. Holiday
5. Boulivard Of Broken Dreams (w/ musical end)
6. Restless Heart Syndrome
7. Favorite Son (w/ musical end)
8. Are We The Waiting (w/ musical end)
9. St Jimmy (w/ Minority ending)
10. Give Me Novicaine
11. She's A Rebel
12. The Last Night On Earth (musical version)

Act 2:

13. Before The Labotomy (musical version)	
14. Extrordinary Girl
15. Too Much Too Soon (musical version)
16. 21 Guns (musical version)
17. Letterbomb
18. When It's Time
19. Missing You
20. Wake Me Up When September Ends
21. Homecoming
22. Whatsername (musical version)

Mods, what would your stance be on me uploading this? There are two seperate files for it, one for each act, and it's 320kbps. 

Edit: I should mention that The End is at the start because I enjoy the bookend with the sustained D minor.

Edit 2: uploading to clyp.it now. It's not the greatest thing ever, was whipped up in a day, and I'll probably make another version of it, but I'm still pretty proud of it. </TEXT>
