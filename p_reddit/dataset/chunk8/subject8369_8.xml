	<TEXT> Who ever said ignoring gender... no one is for making unisex restrooms, and most rational people see limitions in trans athletes competing in events (trans mtf competing in a women's completion would be simply unfair)... people just think it's ok if you identify as a women to use a woman's restroom just like your license can say you are a woman if you identify as one... there would need to be consistency across formal identification and some expectation of making an effort to look the part... I am not sure where we disagree or who even advocates discarding gender or reducing it to a social construct? If it was simply a social construct it wouldn't cause people such innate distress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's patronizing but to suggest that people who are already deeply suffering and have high rates of morbidity from suicide to sexual assault that they are being fed some rosy picture of their reality. There is some stupidity where this is taken too far and people identify as a cat or a pony... there is no biological way or reason that could happen, but gender makes sense that sometimes either epigenticallty or some other mechanism might cause misimprinting of gender. 

If someone identifies as another gender why can't there be some no fuss way of letting them live that life. Fuck even Iran allows for and supports gender reassignment surgery because they recognize it's a part of who someone is... let that sink in for a second, sharia law Iran. It's done without hoopla, they have a medical panel exam the applicant, determine its not a whim and a real medical needs, and then allow them to undergo plastic surgery and change their paperwork...

No one chooses to be a gay and not one chooses to be trans... if you are a straight man you generally never thought about fucking a dude, it never occurred to you. One day when you were going through puberty you suddenly noticed you wanted to have sex with females... like honestly for a bit of time until your hormones come in check that's almost all you wanted to do. Similiary you never once looked at women and felt like you were one of them... 

This idea that if we allow trans people to live normal lives out as their gender identity that there will be some epidemic and there simply won't be.. no more than normalizing homosexuality changed the fact that 5% of the popoulation is gay. Being trans comes with its own challenges. It's hard to find partners. The transition is at best good enough and there are social and biological complications. If we normalize this it's not going to do anything other than allow trans people to live their lives as they want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems better than the alternative... in the setting of the stigma and challenges trans folks face it's hard to judge the effectiveness, but I guess it's all we really have right now. Telling people to stop being trans works as well as telling people to stop being gay. At the end of the day conservative opposition to trans seems similiar to the ultimately losing side of history opposition to being gay. It seems limited return on investment. Conservatives need to focus on core conservative values that are pretty universal: stable core family relations, fiscal responsibility, right privacy, limited government, etc... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Treating it involves gender reassignment... because that works... there have been many experiments on gender, often on gender ambiguous people and it seems that gender is imprinted on your brain and in some minority it does not match the biological sex. Similiary sexual orientation is imprinted too. We inately know our gender and gender orientation and in some people the software does not match the hardware and it's immensely distressing. I don't know why conservatives direct such venom at trans or gay people... many of whom want marriage and monogamous partnerships allowed by recognition under the law.

	<TEXT> No, it is because people have mutually agreed to a system driven by rule of law which is the core tenant of our constitution. Application of law, which is written by fallible men, to complex situations is messy so we have agreed that the courts will be arbiters of this law. The police generally serve to enforce the law. And while we have issues in America with police behavior (say civil forfeiture), generally America is governed by the rule of law. Obviously its more complex than that, but at its base we mostly generally agree that we want disputes settled in accordance to the law by the judicial system because its the best way to protect our basic rights, our property and provide for a stable functioning society.

	<TEXT>  You omitted the analogy of career vs friends. No analogy is perfect. The basic tenant is delayed gratification and investment in a cause that yields a long term return. It is human to develop feelings of closeness and intamacy with others as you go through life but there are healthy ways to channel that to friendship or to address those situations before they become an issue. Otherwise, no relationship will survive difficult times and really those are when relationships really come to matter...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk, all day long people have urges to do things that are not good for them... you get angry driving home because some truck with truck nuts coal rolled you... you have the urge do harm to their car and or them but you don't because you recognize the need to be a part of a functional society and don't want to ruin your own life to teach that attention seeking asshole a lesson.

Or a better example you might want to eat only bacon but recognize you are want health and longevity and in the long run it makes you happier to forgo that junk food today. Or you might want to hang out with your friends but you work long hours because ultimately you find your career choice fulfilling and want to excel at it.

Life is about choices. Investment in a meaningful mongongamous relationship has an opportunity cost in missing out on flirtation and new relationships but when it's good has unique worth in a deep kind of love and support born out of years shared difficulty, joy and investment into the relationship. 

Ultimately, one also might wonder if you mistake friendship and familiarity for sexual attraction... you can be drawn to people and form friendships without giving into the sexual attraction part... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, it seems like the real conspiracy is missed in the discussions of building 7 or debris patterns. 

Basically, an organization (al quada) formerly funded by the US, now fund by Saudi Arabia (a US ally) had 19 men (largely from Saudi Arabia) plow a plane into US buildings. 

Saudi Arbaian leadership had ties with the Bush administration. They were never held accountable for their actions. Instead, the US invaded Afghanistan (not totally unreasonably), but then proceeded to invade Iraq... based on fake claims and based on unsubstantiated intel...

When an ambassador wrote a white paper debunking those claims, Cheney and company outed his wife as a CIA operative.

We then invaded Iraq, using contractors associated with the administration where billions were unaccounted for...

There are tons of conspiracies there, and most don't have to do with free fall or debris patterns... but yet no one here is interested...

I mean fuck, cheney and libby commited treason outing Plame... they invented a causus belle in wmd and yellow cake and their friends got rich while they maimed ans killed 10s of thousands of US soldiers, 100,000s of iraqis... and they also suspended our civil liberties in the process, the media failed, and Saudi Arabia got off scott free and even benefited to have Iraq, one of their geopolitical opponents destroyed...

Even now Saudi Arabia is agitating against the Iran deal because Iran is a geopolitical foe...

The conspiracy is Saudi Arbaian involvement in US foreign policy...  </TEXT>

And while you are correct, anti smoking ad campaigns are good (although even good public awareness efforts can have bad outcomes), I am not certain this video is particularly good for anyone... it does not make people educated media consumers, or help people understand the nuances of government/ media interaction... it just dogmatically labels government/corporations as evil and bad. Governance has to happen somehow and media will always be biased, and we as members of a democracy need to learn to function within these limitations. This video is just as much about superficial fear mongering as any of the tactics it decries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, so no. DT happens because alcohol stimulates your GABA system. If your are constantly drunk, your brain responds by down regulating GABA. This takes about 2 weeks, longer in naive drinkers, shorter in alcoholics. Withdrawal is when you take away the alcohol this down regulated system all of a sudden is understimulated and you get symptoms. Since gaba is responsible for the downer parts of your brain, not enough GABA results in over stimulation... so tremor, hallucinations, seizures. You can withdraw while drinking because for people who are constantly very drunk, if they get used to a BAC of 300 they might withdraw when the start to get below 100. Basically they aren't drinking fast enough or strong enough alcohol... there also seems to be a wind up aspect where if you get behind and the excitatory symptoms are out of control, you might need more than usual gaba targeting substances to get the symptoms under control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, binge drinking less likely to withdraw because you are not constantly depressing your gabanergic system and are able to go periods between drinking without withdrawal... if you drank less but daily without fail and had constantly elevated alcohol in your system you would be at higher risk for withdrawal. Also, the missing a heart beat, alcohol can definately give you arrhythmias of variable forms... so your heart might have been racing, or skipping beats or had irregular beats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem with regular heavy drinking, even if less than the professional alcoholics (when your alcohol intake can reasonably be measured in liters hard alcohol or 30 racks of beer per day) can progress to heavier drinking over time, particularly in settings of increased stress. 

Heavy drinking isn't healthy, it's expensive, and make you feel crappier and less mentally sharp, so good on you for cutting back... 1-2 drinks for a man daily is probably ok... but more than that it's time to reconsider alcohol in your life... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's variable by person, and also duration for drinking and amount really matters. For people drinking 1-2L of hard alcohol daily, bad withdrawal is more likely but even people who drink less can get bad withdrawal too. 

Some people wake up and have to drink first thing in the morning because they are already tremelous. Also if you withdrew in the past and had seizures or complications it means your are likely to do so in the future. 

People are complicated though... it's hard to predict.  </TEXT>

The question itself is rather vague and general which makes it hard to answer. Muscles are one part, neurological development and brain size is another (both for processing inputs and motor control), selective pressure is a third, and mass to size ration, cardiac output, warm blooded vs cold blooded etc etc... and these factors vary depending on the ecological niche occupied by a given animal. A better question is why do the small mammals, largely rodents, that we encounter have twitchy motions... </TEXT>

Jonny Depp made a parody video of him on funny or die as well and garnered no response... yet SNL reliably drew his ire.

His criticism of the NYT? I get his attention to it
- it's a national Newspaper, although why he singles it out more than say the Washington Post is Washington Post or WSJ (after that recent editorial) is unclear.

Also, why is he so caught up in what stars say about him, like at he golden globes? It's not like many of his supporters, or anyone else really watch the golden globes or care very much about Meryl Streep a musings on the contributions of a few immigrant starlets to Hollywood. Or goes after Shwartzinaeger?


Why is that he wastes political capital on these seemingly small and misguided feuds? It's because he wants approval and standing in the social circles he knows... NY elites, show business etc. He does not care about the little people... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump isn't actually interested in legislating a conservative agenda... he wants popularity and approval. And while I used to think it was popoularity in national polls, I am increasingly starting to think he wants approval and popoularity among the national elite, particularly the New
York elite. That's why he is so fixated on SNL... Maher and other comedians go after him but SNL really grinds his gears... because he probably watched it and it's a NY institution. Same with the NYT... So he blows his capital fighting those fights instead of advancing a conservative agenda he does not understand. 

Meanwhile, Ryan is not charismatic or skilled enough to lead and unite the republican house and, despite media claims to his wonkishness, not smart enough to craft bills that intelligently and functionally lead to effective and good governance along conservative principles.

The republicans have seized all the levers of governance only to realize they have lost the visionary, imaginative and intellectual parts of their party along the way and have not actual clue how to govern or achieve the promises and principles they ran on.

Ryan's healthcare bill is was terrible. It cut care, cost more in the long run, and didn't make the healthcare marketplace any more open or competitive. The dems didn't like it because it threatened coverage for poor people, republicans didn't like it because it didn't save money, and hard core conservatives didn't like that it didn't really roll back all that much of the ACA. The bill had nothing good for anyone... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want him to answer or stand trial... trials serve many reasons. For civil cases it is about offering restitution to an injured party (both in the tacit acknowledgment of wrongdoing and the monetary award). 

But in my opinion criminal proceedings are not for the victim, or for their families or interested parties. They are for the state... to enforce the laws that govern a functional society. 

Bannon's trial won't fix the damage him and the Trump administration has already wrought to the credibility and function of our executive branch. Nor reverse the hate he has unearthed, nurtured and fanned. But, if he is shown to have had committed treason or some other infraction, his trial would serve as a record of his doings and his punishment would be a reaffirmation of the functioning of government and rule of law. 

If he commits suicide, it leaves him a mystical nexus for the conspiracy theorists and the fringe to spin their own narrative. We have found that bringing hate to the light can be dangerous because if it hasa critical mass its starts to thrive in the open... 

But I do beleive that Americans are still law abiding and retain some civic grounding and that treason, collusion with foreign governments and duping the American public will be universally rejected. And, if done right, may serve as a bipartisan nexus to recover from this collapse of American political insitutions... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not, but transgender people identify as the opposite from their biological sex. It's different from body dysmorhia because after a sex change they are happy and feel more comfortable with improvement in outcomes... less likely to have dysphoria, depression, suicidality. 

But there are limits and sports falls at the limit.... having MTF compete in women's categories is simply an unfair advantage and breaks the sport. Also, for ftm if they are taking steroids and other meds that are banned as PEDs they also shouldn't be allowed to compete. 

It's tricky because inhalers for asthma are also PEDs but the meds in ftm like testosterone are clearly more problematic from a PED standpoint. 

Again, we can respect the medical needs of the transgender population while recognizing reasonable limits...

Edit: literature on the subject is murky. A brief look suggests while dysphiria improves a Swedish stufy in 2011 showed possibly worse outcomes for mortality and suicide... however sub group analysis of more recent reassignments 1989 to current shows similiar mortality/suicide rates to the general popoukace...  basically gender reassignment is one piece of the puzzle...which makes sense given that trans youth tend to be at risk for all sorts of social issues like sexual assault and homelessness and discrimination. Gender reassignment does not tux that. </TEXT>

Tesla was brilliant and ahead of his time but he is not the only, and probably not even the most important overlooked scientist or inventor. 

People like teslas mad scientist story and the mystique surrounding him but his isolated contribution to science is often overblown... this was a time of immense rapid progress at the height of the Industrial Age... people were racing for firsts... because ideas were floating around and the environment is as ripe for invocation. Tesla was an prominent part of that age but Bell and Edison are the only ones demented... partially likely because they had massive companies bearing their names... tesla died a pauper... that's probably a big party of the legacy thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing I refuse to underestimate is humanities pennant for slaughtering other humans and if really struggle to belief that given the opportunity to harness the earths magnetic field for large scale energy generation the major militaries of the past century would have done so... not to mention that the USSR would have missed this opportunity to show up the capabilist West. 

I just don't see energy starved Imperoal Japan or Nazi germany from ignoring this tech... Later nuclear subs sent the Cold War into another level because nuclear subs were not behoven to refueling stops and could not be tracked. Soviets experimented with high risk molten sodium reactors. Even today american logistical support for war making is what makes us the only true power capable of force projection and even that is vulnerable to new long range missles that threatens our airlift and sealift capability... I find it hard to believe our military would overlook the ability to leave the constraints of fuel behind...

Tesla is not remembered because curriculums and text books have limited space and Edison was a skill d inventor and self promoter... also tesla was less skilled on delivering finished goods and made less of a direct impact. Also, he didn't exactly publish science papers or rigourlsy test his discoveries.

Most Americans maybe hear about bell, rarely marconi or other contemporary inventors. Kind of like we remember Eli Whitney as cotton gin inventor and slater for bringing the industrial revolution... these people become simplified stand ins for entire eras of scientific acomplishment. In general our history overlooks the contribution of scientists in favor of lawyers and politicians...

	<TEXT> Honestly, energy is a prime component of the logistics of conducting warfare. And if people thought they could power their war machines with wireless free energy... well we would have seen World War II and then Cold War era utilization of the technology. 

Simply given that logistics is the Achilles heal of any army and the amount of resources and lives devoted to protecting fuel conveys and supply missions I just don't see such tech being overlooked in soviet or American plans for WWIII and such would expect to have seen said technology deployed in Cold War Germany, the DMZ, and other anticipated fault lines or in hot conflicts like Vietnam. 

Also don't see the fuel starved Nazis ignoring this during WWII. Also don't see Israel with a small territory to defend and also import fuel dependence overlooking such tech either....

America is currently the only nation that can project its forces in any meaningful way and even then is really exposed if the enemy can target US airlift, sealift, aerial refueling capability. Other countries simply don't even have those capabilities to begin with. So you believe everyone is voluntarily hamstringing their abilities to humor big oil? Do people really think Russia but molten sodium cooled reactors on fast attack subs that could never be turned off if they had other options? </TEXT>

Israel has a smaller elite team that develops really high end multiple exploit attacks like stuxnet. Israel like their assasinations doesn't leave fingerprints and denies it if they do. Precision is the game. That's why the US paid heir firm to hack the bernidino iPhone. Mystery, surgical precision, innovation... that's their fingerprint. Stuxnet was a technical marvel, US resources (they tested on a mock up centerfuge built in US desert) and Israel tech and intelligence (5 new exploits, has a targeting mechanism for specific simiens centrifuges, secretly attached itself to USB drives to get to offline system).

China goes after industrial and government data and secrets... if they steal political info they don't share it. They wouldn't mess with US politics because that could invite the US to do the same. Also, Chinese aren't a sophisticated in the misinformation game.

Russia... we know they have teams of everything from elite hackers all the way down to paid posters on comment sites on domestic and western web sites. I wouldn't be surprised if they let hackers operate from their territory in return for state sponsored work/ sharing info kind of like the british let drake raid Spanish gold ships... also this political destabilization and misinformation is a a GRU favorite going back to before WWII... the russian conventional forces might be a shadow of soviet might but their special forces and propoganda units are in fine form... Crimea is an example of propoganda, undercover cells, followed by special forces and then conventional forces. The article attack required huge resources, a propoganda/misinformation unit, the motive, and political backing... if the shoe fits...

	<TEXT> This is what was so upsetting about this election. 

Yes, Hilary has her flaws and has her demons. Her campaign was sometimes too insular, too aggressive about trying to control the narrative. They reacted badly to minor scandals and missed the boat on the economy. They tried to hang the election on Trump being despicable and it turned out not to matter to many voters who were concerned with their own short-term economic well-being. 

But, even many democrats bought into lies and the fox news/ republican generated narrative about her being a liar, about her being out for herself. Benghazi never got anywhere except to create a narrative of untrustworthiness. The emails showed the realisitic working of a stateswoman committed to her job but it got spun as being two faced. The home server was a problem, but many politicians have resorted to private email because of limitations of government email incuding her predescors.

And so all the while, even liberals who voted for her would grumble about how they were picking the better of two evils, or how she was slightly better... when her opposition was acutally corrupt, was actually unqualified, was a relentless liar, actually hides business dealings etc.... meanwhile Hilary, while too pro wall street and corprotist, too supply side, nevertheless planned to raise the minimum wage, had policies for everything for family leave to syria ready to go... etc.

We all bought into this smear campaign agaisnt hilary and we now are going to pay the price. It is time we support our press but demand from them accoutnability and better communication. It is time we start to build a shared platform of facts which the right and left agree upon so that we can then build consensus policy from that platform... 

Till then feelings will rule the roost, and when people let feeligs dictate votes they are suseptable to con men like trump and smear campaigns like swift boat and the anti hilary hit job... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care if people smoke, just not next to me. 

So if you live in an apartment building and you fill my apartment with smoke? That is inconsiderate and rude. Also, smoking under people's windows. Why should I harm my health with your habit or smell that foul smell.

Smoke near children? Well increasing their risk of asthma and SIDS. Also, if you smoke with kids in the car that is messed up to.

Smoke on a patio, or in a bar, well I am ok with that being illegal too. I want to able to go in public without dealing with the byproducts of your habit. 

If you are on oxygen, please stop smoking, you are a firehazard to everyone. Especially if you live in an apartment complex. Oh and dont smoke as you fall asleep if other people live in your building. Also, firehazard. 

Finally, as long as you probably dispose of cigarette butts. You wouldn't throw wrappers on the street, why is it ok to throw butts in the street.

 As for hunting? dont shoot endangered animals, don't use leaded shot and its cool. Also going to those places that basically release or tie up domesticated animals for you to shoot is wierd too... kind of more sad and pathetic than anything else... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mannafort- documented payments lobbying for vanukovitch.

Trump campaign staff- Changed the republican platform to pro Russia at the convention...

Flynn - documented payments russian companies which he didn't disclose to pentagon (illegally), lied about discussing sanctions with Russians as they were being kicked out of one of their diplomatic properties for trying to influence US election. Sat next to Putin at dinner in Russia.

Sessions: lied about meeting with Russian ambassador... recorded on government logs.

Trump: opaque business dealings, no tax returns, no blind trust, no one knows his family's business dealings. Sucsseful businessmen in Russia are all tied to the state and Putins inner circle... trump business contacts in Russia are 100% compromised and phones tapped by KGB... what does Putin have on him?

Where there is smoke there is fire? This sub is about the facts and making up your minds... what ever the media says, these are the facts.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Administration with murky business dealings, record levels of opacity for the president regarding his assets and conflicts of interest... his family business now linked to the executive and does business in all sorts of less than open places.

His campaign advisor was tied to Russian intervention in Ukraine, his  security advisor was talking to the Russians about sanctions and lied about consulting fees he was paid before in violation of the emoioemenrs clause, his attorney general who prosecute any malfeasance lied about speaking to the Russians, possibly Russian intelligence leaked his oppositions internal emails... 

Maybe you don't buy the msm narrative... but why is it somehow assumed trump and his people aren't involved in something nefarious...

If this sub is truly about transparency, freedom, civil liberties, the truth then one would expect people to demand a special prosecutor, trump to open up his business dealings, and further investigation....

At this point it's going to be a more pertinent question of who in trumps cabinet is not speaking to the Russians or met with their ambassador and who hasn't been paid by them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically, it is as always an open question of who would work in the Trump administration. Between the factions inside the administration, to trumps own instability and lack of experience, senior jobs in the trump White House were risky with little chance for reward... Senior experienced hands wanted no part in this undertaking. 

it now seems that maybe people with Russia ties are the ones who supported trump early and took the jobs. 

Early on you had Flynn and mannefort. No one expected this from session... who knows who else has Russia baggage...

Russian vetted people are all around trump... are they directing him? Is he getting black mailed into picking them? Is some else senior compromised? Is bannon using Russian assistance to advance his white nationalist agenda? How to get trumps and his family's business ties factor into this?

Shit be getting nefarious... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean that is a dangerous and hard question as trump even lies about the weather.... might paint him into a corner.

No, it's going to be something like "was that the greatest speach to congress ever, or would you see Roosevelt as to declare Ear on Japan might have edged him out a little?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe he though no one would check? Or that it would look bad to say yes? It would not be the first politician to lie about a blatantly checkable fact... I mean maybe he is taking cues from the top... considering Flynn did it too maybe it's a job requirement for the trump administration... </TEXT>
