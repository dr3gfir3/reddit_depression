	<TEXT> Thats true about their origin, but my point is that he (Trump) is doing this under the guise of trying to prevent another 9/11, yet he isn't touching the countries who perpetrated it.

Also, as this is an executive order he didn't need to pick the same countries Obama has looked at, it's not like Trump is one for towing the line.

He's clearly just trying to look like he's doing something, whilst not effecting the richer Arab nations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your input! 

They said it's to keep numbers down! I'm not annoyed at my friend, and I'm certainly not hurt, I just feel it's a huge ask for me to go solo when it'll cost so much, and possibly hurt my gf's feelings.

Also, I already booked the double hotel room when I thought I had a plus one, so the groom thinks I'm coming so if I now send the confirmation back with "I will not be attending" after he's told me I don't have a plus one I don't want it to seem spiteful!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They said it was to limit numbers they only invited plus ones they've met or know quite well!

They've met my girlfriend twice, like 6 years apart, so they know we've been together at least that long.

As I said to somebody above, it's their special day so they can and can't invite who they like, but I agree with you, we've been together long enough that she could realistically be my wife. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do agree with you and have personally ran through that train of thought in my head, but when I did the counter arguments I came up with myself were:

1. Yes, weddings are expensive. But the main expense is the venue, the rings, the cake, the band, etc. None of which get more expensive per guest. The additional cost for having plus ones there would be that of the meal, which they'll more than make back in wedding gifts. Plus, I guarantee it'd cost me a lot more for me and my girlfriend to go, than it'd cost them to have us there.

2. I do 100% agree it's their day and their rules, I have no hard feelings at all that my girlfriend isn't invited, I'm just trying to figure out if I should still go despite that. There'd be absolutely no love lost between me and my friend even if I don't go (on my end, anyway)!

3. I guess yes, I can physically afford the grand it'll cost. It would have to come out of my savings and will be a Grand I don't spend on something else, however. I had no qualms with paying the grand (I've already prebooked double rooms at the hotel and meals, when I assumed I had a plus one), but I just can't justify going myself I don't think! At least if me and my SO could make a long weekend of it, it'd be like a nice weekend for us too, justifying the spend.

4. Me and my gf have been together 8 years and lived together for, like, 5. I'm pretty sure that's longer/more than the bride and groom at this wedding. Not inviting my gf would be like not inviting someone's wife. Even if she wouldn't say it I think it would hurt my GF's feelings if I went.

	<TEXT> It's not like a wedding abroad, but the hotel is ~ $160 a night, and it would be two nights. Travel there would be $100, alcohol and food would be expensive, wedding gift would be expensive, etc.

And yeah, I got the save the date in a postcard form so it just had my name on it, but I assumed that was because it was a post card and you don't typically address post cards to two people. However, my actual invite came later and it just had my name on it so I asked my friend and he confirmed it was limited numbers and just me invited. </TEXT>

I can understand not drinking as alcohol can devastate lives, etc, but depriving yourself of a game just seems silly - like a pseudo act of faith.

I'm not sure why I'm even posting as I'm not going to change your mind, nor should I try to. It's just frustrating you will miss out on great games!

If there is a heaven do you think when you rock up to the pearly gates God will say "you lived your life as a devout man, buuuuut.... you did play Zelda..."? Surely if there's an omnipotent being he/she/it has much bigger concerns than the harmless pass times of their creations. </TEXT>

Thanks a lot, man!  I have it working.  What I did was:

    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool)
    {
       // Adds observer to watch for a change of user defaults
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(userDefaultsDidChange), name: UserDefaults.didChangeNotification, object: nil)
    }
    
    func viewWillDisappear()
    {
        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self, name: UserDefaults.didChangeNotification, object: nil)
    }
    
    
    func userDefaultsDidChange()
    {
        print("user defaults did change.")
        upScore = UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey:"thumbsUpScore") as! Int
        downScore = UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey:"thumbsDownScore") as! Int
        let upScoreUpdate = ("\(upScore)") // Makes upScore a new parameter of type string for setting the button title
        thumbsUpButton.setTitle(upScoreUpdate, for: .normal) // Sets button title
        let downScoreUpdate = ("\(downScore)") // Makes downScore a new parameter of type string for setting the button title
        thumbsDownButton.setTitle(downScoreUpdate, for: .normal) // Sets button title
    }

Not sure how clear that'l be with the formatting of reddit, but anyway.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,

To boil my example down to its most basic form, I have two view controllers:

VideosViewController.Swift
VideoView1.Swift

In VideoView1.Swift I have a thumbs up button, when I press it once a variable called "upScore" changes to 1, when I press it again it changes back to 0.  After upScore updates, it is made into a UserDefault:

UserDefaults.standard.set(upScore, forKey:"thumbsUpScore")

What I want to do is have a UIlabel on VideosViewController display the current score in real time.  I guess what I need for this is the notifications centre to observe for changes in the user default?  Is that correct?  If so, how would I go about implementing this?  I've done a fair bit of googling but no results after roughly 2012 show UserDefaultsDidChange.  Has this been superseded?

Thanks very much, any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends where you live.

In Scotland it's free, so we really stand to lose nothing by going - except the wage you could have earned in the place of going. 

If you're in America or another country where it costs exorbitant amounts to go, you need to weigh up how much value or earning potential your degree will add and how long it'll take you to pay back.

	<TEXT> Hi Picador, 

Thanks so much for responding.  This is what I've implemented - and it is working as I hoped - is this what you had in mind?

class VideoView1: UIViewController, DataSentDelegate {

    var player1 = AVPlayer()

And then later.......

    func playVideo()
    {
        let videoURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/Volumes/Mac HDD/Users/Pinchy/Documents/App/Ripple/Ripple/5secvid.mp4")
        player1 = AVPlayer(url: videoURL)


So I define player as a variable outside of any functions, but then give it a specific value within a function later?

Thanks again! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to use parameters from one function in another parameter? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all. 

In the image attached I have two functions - one which houses and starts a video playing, before looping it.

Another, which is a delegate that receives a variable called "data" which receives some information.

I want to use "data" to pause / play the video, however the video is defined in one function, and the "data" parameter is in a separate function, so they're oblivious to one another.

What is the best way to go about getting "player" in the scrollViewDidScroll?

Thanks a lot!

Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier; I just got back to my computer and what you suggested seems to be working!!!

https://imgur.com/a/dsDhT (homelessness donation)

My confusion was that I thought I had to go to the receiving view controller and make it a delegate there, but from what you've showed me, I need to preemptively specify in the sending view controller what the receiving view controller is called?  Is that right? 

I would never have figured this out without you, so thanks very much for your time and persistence!

I may have more questions in future, so watch this space!!

	<TEXT> Thanks for the response!  Firstly, I did try.  If I try:

videosScrollView.delegate = self 

I get "use of unresolved identifier videosScrollView."

If I try:

VideosViewController.delegate = self 

I get "instance member 'delegate' cannot be used on type 'VideosViewController'."

I get your point, but can I use the debugger when I don't actually have any error?  I understand that the delegate is nil so no information is carried, but it's due to my lack of familiarity with the delegate method that I can't figure out what to do next, would the debugger tell me any more than I already know in this instance?

I've found tutorials online and followed several, but they *all* entail carrying data to another view controller as you move to that view controller using segue or prepare to segue.  This is where I'm lost as I don't know what I should do in the place of this.

I do think the metaphor you've cited is apt, but through tutorials and reading online I've managed to go from zero coding experience to a semi functional app that does what I want (even if the code is bastardised, but that's to be expected for a beginner), building this app is in itself the learning, not a shortcut to the end result.  

I'll keep plodding on!  Thanks for your help so far! </TEXT>

Just wondering specifically what you mean by assign something to it?  Sorry, I'm not familiar with Swift lingo too well (yet)!

Are you saying I need to add:

**mainViewController.delegate = self**

to the function on the subview (the one I'm sending the data to)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks I'll definitely give this a try after work too! It's scrolling width-wise, so I'll use that. 

Is pause a universal command? Even though the AVPlayer is on page 1, can I just tell it to pause from the view controller that houses the scroll view?

It would be helpful if I can get my head round delegates as I have a thumbs up and down button in front of the scroll view, so I need Interactions with the main view controller to pass the "like" or "dislike" data to whatever sub view is active! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the detailed answer - I'll try this tonight!

I did suspect that was doing nothing because I tried to print delegate on the view controller and it said delegate was nil!

How do I assign something to the delegate? I'll have a look online in the mean time, but if you have more time to answer that'd be appreciated!

Thanks!

Edit:

Just to clarify, are you saying I need to change the code on the sub view to:

SUB VIEW (XIB FILE) 

import UIKit 
import AVKit 
import AVFoundation 
import Firebase 

class VideoView1: UIViewController, DataSentDelegate { 

func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat) 
  { 
  **mainViewController.delegate = self**
  print("I'm on subview and Page: (data)") 
  } 
}

	<TEXT> Okay, so:  What I have is a view controller that has a UIScrollView and 2 sub views which can be scrolled between.  One subview has a video in it.  I have a variable in my main view controller called "Page" which stores what page is scrolled to at the moment, either 0 or 1 (for subview 1 or 2).

I'm trying to use protocol and delegate to carry this variable "page" to the sub view such that I can pause the video on sub view 1 if page = 1, but play it if page = 0.  

My code is:

VIEW CONTROLLER:

import UIKit 
import AVFoundation
protocol DataSentDelegate 
{ 
func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat) 
}

class VideosViewController: UIViewController, UIScrollViewDelegate {

var delegate:DataSentDelegate?

@IBOutlet weak var videosScrollView: UIScrollView!

override func viewDidLoad() 
{
    super.viewDidLoad()
    videosScrollView.delegate = self
}

func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) 
{ 
let width = scrollView.frame.size.width 
let page = scrollView.contentOffset.x / width
   
 // If whole number
    if page.truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: 1) == 0
    {
    // Print page number
    print("Page: \(page)")
    }
    // Pass required data to delegate
    delegate?.scrollViewDidScroll(data: page)
}


SUB VIEW (XIB FILE)
import UIKit 
import AVKit 
import AVFoundation 
import Firebase
class VideoView1: UIViewController, DataSentDelegate 
{
func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat) {
print("I'm on subview and Page: \(data)")
 }
}

Where I run my app and scroll between screens the console gives me the printed info from the view controller, i.e. "Page: 0" and "Page: 1" etc, but it isn't printing any info from the sub view, which suggests I've not set this up right and my data isn't carrying through to the sub view.

Can you see any obvious reasons as to why?

Sorry if that's not clear, I've cut out a lot of code that isn't relevant to what I'm trying to implement here!

Thanks again.

*Edit: I've seen a few tutorials that use delegates/protocols but they also require prepareforsegue, which isn't any use for me here* </TEXT>
