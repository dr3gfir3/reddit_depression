	<TEXT> Help me. Please, God, help me.

Its here.

The day is here.

I dont have much time, but let me explain.

I woke up this morning and although the day seemed normal, I emerged from my bedroom with a sense of foreboding a je ne sais quoi, as the French say. Do you ever wake with a small sense of hopelessness? As if your body is merely a shell for your own personal anxieties? Im sure you have, but today, I felt that sevenfold.

I felt a deep dread as I puttered about my apartment, going through the daily motions without much feeling shuffling to my kitchen; frying an egg; browsing r/TheRedPill. However, my feelings soon came to a crescendo when I looked at the clock

10:00 AM.

Suddenly, I knew. The reckoning of May 20th would begin at 10:30. I pushed up from the table, suddenly pouring with sweat. As if in a trance, I went to take my keys from the kitchen counter and exit my house. I had to get to my car.

As I approached my car, my physical symptoms became worse. My eyes bulged; my body felt like it was electric, nerves pulsing with a wicked form of energy. I stumbled to my car, dropping the keys countless times, fingers scrabbling on the ground to find the lost object. My world was inside out and the anxiety was like cocaine to my system.

I finally managed to start my car and begin towards my inevitable destination. I didnt want to begin that journey, but I had to. My mind was telling me no, but my obligation to a medical appointment was telling me yes.

You too will experience this one day. You will experience the fear, the disgust, the soulless humanity of my own personal May 20th.

The day of my annual colonoscopy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just listened to this yesterday! Awesome story, but what really enhanced it was the homemade quality. I love listening to old-time scary stories. It's like the equivalent of a cozy mystery book. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Icing Addiction was awesome. It depends on what you feel is best- if you think it warrants a sequel, go for it. If you think it's fine on it's own, than that's great too. If 10 years from now you write a sequel, so be it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think I quite understand what your boyfriend is getting at. So, he's going to write an instructional story that the reader will subconsciously perform while reading, thereby dooming/effecting them?

There's actually been a fair amount of those in Nosleep and creepypasta, so I don't see what the problem is. </TEXT>

I mean, what if that guy was a cop, and was just distracting me while he contacted his cop partner!? And what if the cops are calling my phone, and then the NSA's going to track my location and arrest me? I can't handle Guantanamo!

I answer the phone. "I'm 21, okay!?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I threw up right on the liquor counter.

The guy stopped talking and stared at me.

Whatever, the guy was a creep and it wasn't like I was getting that stupid Rumchata anyway. My fake ID looked like a pedo, but so did this guy, so maybe he would've taken it if I hadn't blown chunks in his store. I wiped the upchuck from my mouth and got the hell outta Dodge.

Now my phone is ringing but I never drunk answer the phone. Makes me look sloppy. Life lessons.
