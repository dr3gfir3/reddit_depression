I waited a while to update because nothing has really happened since the parcel incident. I should probably clear some stuff;
 
-       I directed the courier to put the parcel in my shed, forgetting its usually locked. I reckon he put it outside the shed, and Ive now changed my preferences to that. The main reason that is relevant is because I think Tom came into my garden whilst I was in the house to get the parcel  and that fucking scary.
 
Nothing of importance has happened over the past few days. Tom still comes most nights. Its been raining a lot lately, so I havent seen him as often as usual. Even creeps like Tom care about the weather, bless.
 
I check the shed everyday and nothing is missing. Why is he going in there? Hes not even stealing shit; hes just standing in there. That's weird in its own perverted way. Maybe I need to catch him in the act again.
 
Im starting to desensitise to it all now, sadly. Its become a regular occurrence and Im becoming numb. He isnt doing any harm. Yet. I saw a handful comments that scared me shitless. If were believing the theory that Tom used my dads keys to cut his own, he could easily have keys to our house. I swear to god if that fucker comes into my house Ill have had enough. 

Everything escalated last night; Saturday. As previously mentioned, I went to a party Saturday night, and then back to my friends house to stay the night. The party was far away, and my friend Kate picked my friend Anna and I up to take us to the train station. We took a 45-minute train, walked around the town for a bit, and then took a 20-minute bus to the party.
 
It was fun, but we ended up leaving early and heading back to my friend Rosie's house who lived there. It was a fun, normal night; a bunch of drunk pretty girls in party dresses and telling scary storiesaka a straight male nosleep redditors dream. I actually found some good stories on here to tell, old classics like Betsy the Doll, The Smiling Man and that one about the 911 operator. 

What was nice about the evening was that amongst all this Tom the neighbour shit, I had some form of release. I was at a different house, he wasn't going to jump over this fence that was probably taller than him. Nor could he sneak through her gate; it was locked with a key pad.
 
Rosie had pitched a tent in the garden. Her house is kinda small, and there was like 9 of us staying over, so we decided a tent would be fun. Itd be like camping when we were kids! Rosie put up fairy lights and we all sat round together. We spent a lot of time inside the house as it was warmer. My friend Alice brought her polaroid camera and took a bunch of pictures of us all.

The pictures taken of us werent very flattering. We all had very short dresses on and drunk carelessness added to some interesting photos. We left them inside and headed out to the tent.
 
When I heard it, I couldve shit myself.
 
Everyone was asleep; fast asleep. Most of them had just passed out. I hadnt. I was up on my phone. I heard shuffling from Rosie's bike shed. It was a small shed; enough room for maybe one person to fit in and push the bikes out. I heard the door open and close. I froze for a while, listening to him walk about. My mind didn't go directly to Tom. Why would he be here? My friends house was over an hour away from us, and why would he come? And he couldn't get through a locked gate with a keypad.
 
I nudged Anna, who was asleep beside me. Anna, theres someone outside.
 
She sat up, looking confused. Maybe its Rosies parents or her sister.
 
Its fucking 3am, why would they be up? I was in complete disbelief that she couldnt hear him shuffling about.
 
Look, were just still drunk. Just go to sleep I dont know.
 
Maybe I was drunk. Maybe I was hallucinating. I had no fucking clue what I was hearing. I tried to sleep and I couldnt. The only thing separating this night-time stalker and me was a thin sheet of tent fabric.
 
When everyone got up the next morning, they were awfully hungover. I say they, I mean 'we'. It was awful.
 
Alice began flicking through the pictures, laughing at our carelessness. She frowned.
Hey, some of these are missing.
 
I looked through them. I was in about 4 of the 10 pictures taken. All of the pictures of me werent there. We searched all round the room for them, but nothing prevailed. Its like someone broke in and stole them.
 
Whilst they all cleaned up, I managed to sneak into the bike shed. All the bikes remained, but the previously dusty window has been cleaned by a hand. I also found my bag that Id left inside, but the contents were missing.
 
Enraged, I stormed out. Who the fuck emptied my bag?! No one answered, just laughed and looked confused. They all spent the morning jokingly accusing each other of it. I said goodbye, collected my other bag that was still full of stuff and left.
 
I left my stuff in the car because I just wanted to get in the bloody shower. I felt tired, and stressed about the possibility that Tom couldve followed me to my friends house. Whyd he take those pictures? This whole thing is starting to freak me out now. I said in my last post I was intrigued to see where this goes, but now I just want it to be over. I am done with this all. Im gonna set up my dads GoPro later to stream to my phone because I want to know what hes doing.
 
Also, let me add that when I went to get my empty bag from the car the next day, all my stuff had been returned! My friends found this hilarious, and declared that I staged the whole event. I went along with this because I am sick and tired of explaining this story. Every time I try, they make up excuses and say Im making shit up. And Im not. I locked that car door; my dad made me. If he got into the car, he has my dad's CAR key too, which is really scary.

What do I do with the footage when I get it? I can't just waltz into a police station and shove it in their face, can I? Maybe I can. Jesus, I just want this fucker out my life. 



Okay, I just set up the camera in the shed. I've locked the shed up, and I even placed some stuff so it's harder to access. A few people suggested I switch out the lock. That's a good idea, if he's doing weird shit. I don't know how I can do that without my dad noticing, also I have no clue how to do that either. I'll do some research. My dad's been talking about leaving his bike in the other shed in our garden (the other shed just has our lawn mower in), because it gets covered in webs in that one. If he does that, I can switch out the locks and they won't notice until they decide to clean it out. 

First, I wanna catch him. The camera on the battery isn't very long lasting. I've set up the camera so I can see what the camera sees. I'll start recording when he enters. My phone doesn't actually store the footage though; that's all on the camera. I'll upload the footage after tonight.

Clear skies tonight. Tom's favourite time. He doesn't like it when it's raining hard, or snowing. Or just cold. He's picky.

Well, I'll update you guys tomorrow.
