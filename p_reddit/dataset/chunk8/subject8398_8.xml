	<TEXT> The only reason women care about it is because they have been taught to care. I never got double-eyelid surgery, but I remember being as young as 7 and having my mom tell me I was ugly because I had single eyelids. If I looked up at her with my chin down, she would comment that for a moment I looked pretty because I had double-eyelids that way (my monolids were thin). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the first questions people ask is where your parents live. Then when they find out my mom lives a 40 minute drive away, they ask if I visit her a lot. Then why not. And I always fee uncomfortable, I am afraid they will think I would make a bad life partner if I come from a broken family. But at the same time, maybe I WOULD make a bad life partner because I have so many skeletons in my closet.

I am 28 and female and I feel really lonely because of my family problems, I don't have brothers or sisters. Right now I don't have close friends either, everyone is scattered around the world and I can't talk to anyone. I have a decent job as an IT data grunt, doesn't make 6 figures but I can manage on my own. Just lonely all the time. </TEXT>

You far from ruined your entire life. The great thing about background checks is that your previous employer can comfirm you worked at a place but they won't say why you left. You can always pretend you left for other reasons if you want. It may be different if you are applying for a government job, but you will be fine for corporate work. </TEXT>

The guy then scheduled a second date with me, told me he was on his way, then canceled 10 minutes before saying he was hit by a sudden migraine. He contacted me again a few hours later, saying he was so sorry and I was an angel for still talking to him, and promised to make it up to me on our next date. Then an hour before the date he said he was stuck in traffic, can we move it back an hour and a half, and then an hour and a half later he said he would be there in 25 minutes. Then he disappeared and wouldn't take my calls.

	<TEXT> 28/F I Could Have Danced All Night
4 months of voice lessons, 3 years of choir

In previous posts I was told this could be a good audition song for a classical choir (I have only ever sung second soprano so I think that's what they would make me try out for) but I dunno, maybe another song would be better?

I have trouble at the end of each of the 3 sections because I kind of belt the beginning, which makes it harder to then shift up past the break so maybe I need a different song (or a hell of a lot more training).

	<TITLE> Hung up on my aunt today when she kept trying to shame me into talking to my mom </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-16 08:27:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Her: Your mom loves you, she recently started reading a book on how divorce affects children so that she can understand how it affected you...

Me: It is not the divorce. It was getting beaten constantly, she would even shove me with her foot when I was already on the ground...

Her: See, everyone else would have long since forgotten about those things. That is just your depression causing you to keep thinking about it.

I ended up hanging up on her because she kept trying to shame me into talking to my mom. I have been no-contact with my mom since last October and have proved tremendously since then. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-04-16 04:41:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I met some guy through match.com who asked me out. We had fun talking for 2 hours, he said he wanted us to meet again. He named the place and time, and I got all dressed up and arrived there. 10 minutes before the date starts he sends me a text saying he had a migraine and wanted to reschedule for today. Later when his migraine is apparently over, he texts me all apologetic and says I am an angel for even talking to him still, asks me questions about my choir and stuff.

So today I was supposed to meet him again, and again an hour before the date he says he is stuck in traffic coming home from another city. He reschedules it for an hour and a half later, I say okay. Then an hour and a half later he says he just got home, can he pick me up in 20 minutes. I say okay. An hour has passed since then, he still hasn't contacted me, I call him and he doesn't pick up, and now I see he has even blocked me from his online dating profile.

Wtf? I didn't know this guy before, why would anyone go through all that work just to mess with me? I'm 28, not ugly, get along with everyone I know, quiet, etc. I am guessing this guy got hurt by other girls so he did stuff to intentionally hurt me because I was female or something? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I am female and I sometimes reject someone instantly if they are more than 10 years older than me, they praise themselves excessively in their profile, they sound stupid, or I really cannot find myself physically attracted to them.

I think as long as you are genuine you will at least get some of the girls you are interested to respond. Just ask them to grab coffee, so it is casual and there aren't any crazy expectations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I was a creative writing major and graduated in 2010 during the peak of the recession. I couldn't find work for 6 months (may be longer but that was when I moved) and my mom screamed at me non-stop every day for being a failure until I had a severe mental breakdown and someone called the police when I ducked under the eave of their house in the middle of the night to hide from the rain (I had walked in the rain for 7 hours).

Since I was always considered a good writer I did manage to eventually get small freelance writing jobs and eventually a full time job proofreading manuals for a tech company, and from there on I learned new software skills and now make a comfortable 60k a year doing Tableau/Salesforce/SSRS admin stuff. 4 years of college do not necessarily give you a good job - in fact a single year in some community college tech certification program can most likely get you further than a liberal arts degree.

If you aren't afraid of hard work I recommend a double major. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once when I was desperately looking for a job, I got a phone call and I was asked if I were looking for a part time job or a full time job. I blurted out that I was interested in both and would take anything, which caused the interviewer to immediately become disinterested in me because I sounded too desperate.

Luckily I have a good and stable full time job now, found one maybe 2 months later and I have been there for 3 and a half years with a couple raises. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tonight was supposed to be my second date with a guy I met online. Our first date was about a week ago, we barely interact since then, and today was supposed to be our second date. He picked out this fancy restaurant, I check 3 hours ahead of time asking if it is still on, he replies it is. Then I shower, get dressed, pick out my clothes, drive there, and 10 minutes before he cancels texting he suddenly has a migrane and can't even drive. I text back asking if he is stranded somewhere and I need to pick him up, he said he JUST made it home and the migrane hit him. I feel he might be messing with me.

He is a 29 year old sales rep. What do you think, do you think am I being paranoid? </TEXT>
