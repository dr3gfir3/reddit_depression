	<TEXT>  It was not immediately clear who will take over for McCord. I can confirm that Mary is leaving DOJ next month, said Marc Raimondi, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, by email. I cannot provide any additional material at this time.

 McCord is a career civil servant who became acting assistant attorney general in charge of the national security division in October, when John Carlin, an Obama appointee, resigned.  

 McCord [has] been helping oversee the Justice Departments probe into Russian interference

 In March, McCord announced the indictment of  two Russian intelligence officers and two hackers accused of accessing Yahoos network and the contents of webmail accounts. At a press conference, McCord said that Yahoo hacking case was a separate investigation from the hacks of the Democratic National Committee. Thats an ongoing investigation, she said of the D.N.C. matter.

 As the Washington Post reported this week, nearly all the U.S. Attorney positions remain unfilled.

	<TEXT> Not really an article, just an update from NBC News.  Whole thing:

 On April 12, a spokesman for former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said that after consulting with federal authorities about whether he should register as a foreign agent because of his past work in Ukraine, Manafort would be taking "appropriate steps."

 Many took that to mean Manafort was about to register as an agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

 However, when NBC News asked spokesman Jason Maloni directly whether Manafort was going to register, Maloni wouldn't say yes or no. 

 A week later, there is no record of any filing on the Justice Department's website. Maloni told NBC News, "I don't have an update." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This article is an condensed transcript of [an informative episode of a Slate podcast](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/trumpcast/2017/04/the_impeachable_offenses_of_donald_trump.html) of an interview with Noah Feldman, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, on the three areas Trump *made himself* vulnerable to impeachment.

I've further shortened it to fit in one comment and added the two quotes in the first part.

#### Background

 Theres an instinct that it must be about crimes that are on the books, violations of statutes. That is exactly what it doesnt mean, because the word high modifies both crimes and misdemeanors. High crimes and misdemeanors was a technical term that the Framers knew from procedures that the British used for impeachment, and high means governmental or in connection with, in our case, the presidency. **High crimes and high misdemeanors are actions performed in an official capacity by a government official that violate the basic principles of the government** and that therefore subject you to impeachment. They dont have to be actual crimes that are on the statute books at all.

 The real purpose of impeachment at the deepest level is for Congress to express its beliefs about what the right way to be president is with respect to respect for democracy and the rule of law.

Quote from [Justice Joseph Story written in his Commentaries on the Constitution in 1833](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/watergatedoc_3.htm) about how Impeachment applies to offenses of "a political character":

 "Not but that crimes of a strictly legal character fall within the scope of the power; but that it has a more enlarged operation, and reaches, what are aptly termed political offenses, growing out of personal misconduct or gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, various in their character, and so indefinable in their actual involutions, that it is almost impossible to provide systematically for them by positive law They must be examined upon very broad and comprehensive principles of public policy and duty. They must be judged of by the habits and rules and principles of diplomacy, or departmental operations and arrangements, of parliamentary practice, of executive customs and negotiations of foreign as well as domestic political movements; and in short, by a great variety of circumstances, as well those which aggravate as those which extenuate or justify the offensive acts which do not properly belong to the judicial character in the ordinary administration of justice, and are far removed from the reach of municipal jurisprudence".

In Federalist No. 65, [Hamilton defined](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html) impeachable offenses as

 Those offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.

#### 1. Corruption

 Corruption is absolutely at the core of what high crimes and misdemeanors are because corruption means youre gaining something, typically personal, from the fact that you have this government job. His children are still running the business. Its not like he distanced himself or put himself in a blind trust. Arguably, that is itself a form of public corruption. Whether thats impeachable I think would be a debatable question.

 Foreign officials [are] staying in [his] hotels in order to, essentially, get money to the president, that looks like a violation of the Emoluments Clause, and it definitely looks like a form of insidious corruption. Trumps whole business model is based on the branding, and the brand itself has presumably, pre-impeachment, increased in value by virtue of his becoming president.

 Charging more [at his businesses] means something also because its a way to quantify, in economic terms, the gain that the president got from getting elected president. **If you look at the price a room in that hotel with no Trump as president, and you compare it to the price with him as president, the difference between the two prices is the bump he got from becoming president**. In some way, that could stand in for the degree of public corruption. I think one way that he couldve avoided this was not to raise prices in the hotels.

#### 2. Abuse of Power

 Abuse of power is anything the president does that he can only do by virtue of being president that threatens the basic freedoms and capacities of other people.

 Let me take a very concrete example. When Trump tweets that [Obama] has committed at least an impeachable offense and probably also a crime by wiretapping him, hes making an allegation that as president has weight and capacity that it wouldnt have if he were a private actor. And whats more, because he is the head of the DOJ, hes threatening somebody with the possibility of prosecution. Thats something that you can only do if youre president, and if you are doing that without evidence and in order to advance your own interests, thats a classic example of an abuse of power.

 He just did it the other day again with Susan Rice...That could trigger an investigation of the person. **That means that the exact statement with the same exact words have a different effectI would say an unconstitutional effectbecause theyre said by a person who is in fact the president at the time**. Thats where I would draw the line very, very clearly.

 Doesnt the president have free speech? And my answer to that is no. Under impeachment, no ones going to put the president in jail for what he said, but when it comes to removing the president from office, he cant say, Well, that was just me exercising my free speech. Free speech says that Congress cant make a law punishing you for speaking, but it doesnt say that it cant impeach him for things that hes said. Hes not immune from impeachment. I think thats sort of the punchline. The president is never immune from impeachment.

 And saying that all of your political opponents, at one point or another, belong in jail [absolutely crosses the line]. Its great to have free speech values, and Trump should never be put in jail for things that hes said. I would very strongly defend his free speech rights repeatedly, and with my nose held during the campaign, but its not true that hes immune from being impeached.

#### 3. Undermining the Rule Of Law

 Assume for the sake of argument that it could be shown that the president or people very close to him cooperated with Russia in hacking the Democrats during the election. Technically thats conduct that happened before the election, so to that extent the president could make a plausible argument that it shouldnt be considered in his impeachment.

 But [e]lections are the most basic component we have of democracy, and to corrupt those elections by colluding with a foreign power and then give them something back I think would certainly count. Again, if the president did this while he was in office, he would obviously be impeachable for that. Its a little trickier with respect to conduct that happened before because remember in our definition high crimes and misdemeanors are abuses of the office, so if youre not in office, it might be criminal to take action, but it might not be technically impeachable.

 Now, in the real world this may not matter. It may be that if evidence that comes out thatll be good enough for Congress, but I would certainly think that subverting the election process is a good example of subverting democracy, so at least we should start there.

 I would add with that the systematic attack on the press. The press is in the Constitution. Members of the press are not part of the government, but that doesnt mean they dont fulfill the role of a core constitutional function. Calling them the Fourth Estate is a metaphor, but in an important way its also true that **the press is essential to the functioning of democracy**. The Framers knew that, and **thats why they gave the press special protection in the Constitution**. Without them, without a free press, you dont have a functioning democracy. There are no examples in the world of functioning democracy without a free press.

 Trump doesnt have to bend over backward to say how much he loves the press, but it includes not taking actions that are effectively intended to curtail press freedoms, to frighten the press, especially through corporate pressure, into ceasing to be effective critics. That is how democracy erodes. That may make people uncomfortable, but I think its making people uncomfortable because **theyre mistakenly taking the free speech paradigm of the First Amendment and applying it supervision of the president through impeachment**. This is not about punishing the president; its about assuring that the governmental system that respects a free press continues.

#### Closing

 I dont think that Trumps activities are so ordinary that going after him would set a precedent for everybody in office being sought for impeachment. Were talking about concrete enrichment of the president while in office, which has not been the case for other people and is unlikely to be the case for other presidents in the future. Were talking about abuses of power with respect to allegations of crimes that have never been undertaken, to my knowledge, by any president in this way. And if something to do with the Russian allegations is shown, were also talking about a form of corruption of the democratic process that, with the exception of Nixon, has not been shown of a sitting president. You have to focus on these cases because **if you dont use the impeachment process now, there is a question of whats the point of having it at all**. </TEXT>

What is "post-McCarthyist America" and why is it a term actually being used in a press brief from a law firm?

 This law firm has uncovered evidence that the smear campaign is being orchestrated by far-left organizations bent on destroying OReilly for political and financial reasons. The evidence will be put forth shortly and is irrefutable.

The WH tried to insist they were moving on from healthcare after their bill failed but the rest of the GOP won't let them, and now Trump's made it worse by just snubbing the insurers.

 A CMS official confirmed that Verma did not comment on the payments, called cost-sharing reductions, at the meeting and told those gathered that it was a decision to be made by Congress.

 Trump told the Journal that he and Congress would both have to approve the payments.

 Otherwise, those payments dont get made and Obamacare is gone, just gone, Trump said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Condensed, with link to referenced report from Washington Post:

 To make health care more affordable for low-income Americans, the Affordable Care Act provided insurers with cost-sharing reductions  federal payments that defray the cost of deductibles and co-pays for more than 7 million Americans.

 That was the Obama administrations plan at least. House Republicans, however, claimed that the law didnt actually authorize the executive branch to make those payments without an additional congressional appropriation. A federal judge agreed, but that judge also ruled that the administration could carry on making the payments while it appealed the decision to a higher court.
 
 This has left a cloud of uncertainty over the American health-care system ...

  Last week, president Trump told The Wall Street Journal that he was considering withholding those payments, in order to force Democrats to play ball on Obamacare repeal. Specifically, Trump suggested that once he deliberately undermines Americas insurance markets and people start losing their coverage, then Democrats will be desperate to vote for his health-care plan  because everyone will blame Democrats for what he did.  
 
 I dont want people to get hurt, Trump told the paper. What I think should happen  and will happen  is the Democrats will start calling me and negotiating.  They own Obamacare.  
 
 These remarks made insurers nervous. And on Tuesday, executives from several of Americas leading health insurance companies came to Washington to meet with Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. At that meeting, they sought reassurance that the administration would continue to provide cost-sharing reductions next year. They received [none.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/18/health-insurers-asked-the-trump-administration-for-reassurance-on-obamacare-they-didnt-get-it/?utm_term=.6e0eb66a2c76) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What, you think they'd just throw it away?

 The FBI last year used a dossier of allegations of Russian ties to Donald Trump's campaign as part of the justification to win approval to secretly monitor a Trump associate, according to US officials briefed on the investigation.

 This includes approval from the secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of Carter Page, two of the officials said. Last year, Page was identified by the Trump campaign as an adviser on national security.  
 
 Officials familiar with the process say even if the application to monitor Page included information from the dossier, it would only be after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation. The officials would not say what or how much was corroborated.  

 US law enforcement and intelligence officials have said US investigators did their own work, separate from the dossier, to support their findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 presidential election in favor of Trump.

 Comey hasn't mentioned the dossier in all his briefings to lawmakers, according to people familiar with the briefings. To some of them, he has emphasized that the FBI gathered evidence as part of its investigation to support seeking FISA court approval and to take other steps as part of the probe that began last July, according to the officials briefed of the probe.

Also, if you want to see the Federal complaint against 3 SVR operatives where Carter Page is cited as "Male-1", I'll just leave [this here](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1509342/buryakov-et-al-complaint.pdf) as it's mentioned in the article at the end:

 The FBI became interested in Page, the officials say, in part because of concerns about his interactions with suspected Russian intelligence operatives last year. The Justice Department and FBI haven't accused Page of wrongdoing and it's unclear whether any charges could be brought in the investigation.

 The FBI already knew about Page because of his role as a witness in the 2013 federal prosecution of an undercover Russian spy. Prosecutors alleged that the spy had tried to cultivate Page as a source. Page denies he knew he was interacting with a Russian spy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone else find it suspicious Erdogan [extended the state of emergency for another 3 months](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/turkey-extends-state-emergency-three-months-deputy-pm-000741629.html) on the same day Trump essentially gave Erdogan his approval for the constitutional changes?  

Also, why would the US congratulate Erdogan personally?  He didn't win an election himself, and he held a referendum (always a bad idea) during a state of emergency when freedom of speech and assembly was curtailed, and it was for something as huge as completely altering the constitution. And Trump congratulated him for this.

Not to mention, "Yes" won by 1.3 million votes, yet [1.5 million unsealed envelopes were accepted](http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/170420171?src=ilaw), violating the law on the books which states envelopes must be sealed and stamped to be counted. </TEXT>

 "This is unbelievably complicated," lamented Alito. "The one thing about this case that seems perfectly clear to me is that nobody who's not a lawyer  and no ordinary lawyer  could read these statutes and figure out what they are supposed to do."  
 
 "Who wrote this statute?" he asked plaintively. "Somebody who takes pleasure out of pulling the wings off flies?"

 A majority of Americans now view the federal tax system as unfair, including similar shares of Republicans and Democrats. But partisans differ in their concerns about the tax system, with Democrats far more likely than Republicans to express frustration that some corporations and wealthy people dont pay their fair share.  
  
 Among the public overall, 62% say they are bothered a lot by the feeling that some corporations dont pay their fair share of taxes, and 60% say the same about some wealthy people not paying their fair share.  
  
 About four-in-ten (43%) say they are bothered a great deal by the complexity of the system. But with the April 18 tax filing deadline approaching, only about a quarter (27%) say they are bothered a lot by the amount they pay in taxes. And just 20% say that about the feeling that the poor do not pay their fair share of taxes. </TEXT>

Nostalgia for the Obamas days took few occasions throughout the show and was an elephant in the room.  
 
 Vladimir Putin later expressed the sentiments of indirectly missing the Obamas days during an interview broadcast by state television channel Mir. It can be said that the level of trust at the working level, especially at the military level, has not become better but most likely has degraded, Putin stated in describing U.S.-Russia relations since Trump took office.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But you have no problem with the press degrading and defaming a sacred part of our republic, and will even want Trump impeached for calling them out for doing that.

You're making assumptions on what precisely is true and what is not.  Initially, I was simply responding to the headline's question, "Could Trump be impeached for bashing the press?".  And hypothetically, I was trying to explain, with a different Congress, the answer is yes.  Realistically with our Congress, you're trying to argue, the answer is no.  That's fine with me, I just feel like you haven't really been understanding what I've been trying to explain (poorly I guess), which is impeachment is a political process and is based on a mercurial term that encompasses a very broad range of charges including ones based on the collective subjective judgment of the Congress.  This was stated more or less in one of the articles I cited.

 Impeachment, as Justice Joseph Story wrote in his Commentaries on the Constitution in 1833, applies to offenses of "a political character":  
  
 "Not but that crimes of a strictly legal character fall within the scope of the power; but that it has a more enlarged operation, and reaches, what are aptly termed political offenses, growing out of personal misconduct or gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, various in their character, and so indefinable in their actual involutions, that it is almost impossible to provide systematically for them by positive law They must be examined upon very broad and comprehensive principles of public policy and duty. They must be judged of by the habits and rules and principles of diplomacy, or departmental operations and arrangements, of parliamentary practice, of executive customs and negotiations of foreign as well as domestic political movements; and in short, by a great variety of circumstances, as well those which aggravate as those which extenuate or justify the offensive acts which do not properly belong to the judicial character in the ordinary administration of justice, and are far removed from the reach of municipal jurisprudence".[1](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/watergatedoc_3.htm) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Pointing out a violation of the public trust can't itself be considered a violation of the public trust.

It is when it's a false claim and especially if it was done knowingly with actual malice.  Then he would be abusing his power and authority as President and violating the public trust to degrade and defame a sacred part of our republic as expressed in the first amendment.  I'm not saying it's actually going to happen or anyone is going to use it, I'm just making a claim in a hypothetical situation within our framework, it would be a possibility and I'm actually basing it on the real meaning of the words "high crimes and misdemeanors", again, as expressed in the text.

So, we're just going to have to agree to disagree. </TEXT>

 Asked about the relationship at an event in Washington, Pompeo said, "It's fantastic."  

 After the audience giggled, he added: Dont laugh, I mean that."

	<TEXT> I'm just telling you the explanations I've come to understand from people who know more about this than either me or you.  They were discussing pure possibilities rather than strategic paths for anyone wishing to go down that path.  I'm just saying if you think it is as clear cut as you describe, you're definitely wrong.  I may easily be wrong, too, but it's definitely not as simple as you're making it out to be.  

His criticisms of the press are fine, but calling them "the enemy of the people" may actually cross a line where he unduly damages the (protected) press and thus society, which could be considered conduct unbecoming, intimidation, or violating a principle of the Constitution.

Because the thing is, "high crimes and misdemeanors" is a looser term than you think it is.  It has as much to do with the proper fulfillment of duties and spirit of the office, and protecting the spirit of the Constitution, as it does with actual crimes.  It's often described as a "term of art".  

Just one more time.  Last sentence is key.

 [The impeachment process is political in nature, not criminal. Congress has no power to impose criminal penalties on impeached officials.](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html)

 The convention adopted high crimes and misdemeanors with little discussion. Most of the framers knew the phrase well. Since 1386, the English parliament had used high crimes and misdemeanors as one of the grounds to impeach officials of the crown. Officials accused of high crimes and misdemeanors were accused of offenses as varied as misappropriating government funds, appointing unfit subordinates, not prosecuting cases, not spending money allocated by Parliament, promoting themselves ahead of more deserving candidates, threatening a grand jury, disobeying an order from Parliament, arresting a man to keep him from running for Parliament, losing a ship by neglecting to moor it, helping suppress petitions to the King to call a Parliament, granting warrants without cause, and bribery. Some of these charges were crimes. Others were not. The one common denominator in all these accusations was that the official had somehow abused the power of his office and was unfit to serve.  
 
 After the Constitutional Convention, the Constitution had to be ratified by the states. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote a series of essays, known as the Federalist Papers, urging support of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 65, Hamilton explained impeachment. **He defined impeachable offenses as those offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.**

EDIT: added some more clarity as to the threshold I'm focused on. </TEXT>

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/23/donald-trump-cambridge-analytica-steve-bannon

And for background, Cambridge Analytica's past use of mined Facebook data: https://www.fastcompany.com/3054566/this-is-how-the-ted-cruz-campaign-could-be-mining-your-facebook-data

From the First intercept article:

 In late 2015, the turkers began reporting that the Global Science Research survey had abruptly shut down. The Guardian had published a report that exposed exactly who the turkers were working for.**Their data was being collected by Aleksandr Kogan**, a young lecturer at Cambridge University. **Kogan founded Global Science Research in 2014*, after the universitys psychology department refused to allow him to use its own pool of data for commercial purposes. **The data collection that Kogan undertook independent of the university was done on behalf of a military contractor called Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL**. The companys election division claims to use data-driven messaging as part of delivering electoral success.

 **SCL has a growing U.S. spin-off, called Cambridge Analytica**, which was paid millions of dollars by Donald Trumps campaign. Much of the money came from committees funded by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who reportedly has a large stake in Cambridge Analytica. For a time, one of Cambridge Analyticas officers was Stephen K. Bannon, Trumps senior adviser. Months after Bannon claimed to have severed ties with the company, checks from the Trump campaign for Cambridge Analyticas services continued to show up at one of Bannons addresses in Los Angeles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're being oddly pedantic and obstinate and I don't really know why.  It's like you don't want to possibly have to learn anything or have your opinion influenced.

The press have special rights by virtue of being written into the Constitution as their rights to free speech should be inviolable and the President has a duty to uphold that and protect it.  As such the chief executive of law enforcement calling them the enemy of the people could easily be considered a high crime.  Once again:

 **A high crime is one that can only be done by someone in a unique position of authority**, which is political in character, who does things to circumvent justice.

 The phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors" when used together was a common phrase at the time the U.S. Constitution was written and **did not mean any stringent or difficult criteria** for determining guilt. **It meant the opposite**. The phrase was historically used to cover a very broad range of crimes.

 Officials accused of high crimes and misdemeanors were accused of offenses as varied as misappropriating government funds, **appointing unfit subordinates**, not prosecuting cases, not spending money allocated by Parliament, **promoting themselves ahead of more deserving candidates**, threatening a grand jury, disobeying an order from Parliament, arresting a man to keep him from running for Parliament, losing a ship by neglecting to moor it, helping suppress petitions to the King to call a Parliament, granting warrants without cause, and bribery. **Some of these charges were crimes. Others were not.**

The things I have bolded in the last paragraph (other than the last sentence): are those crimes?  are they things common persons can commit?

If you would actually put in some work to educate yourself on the history of impeachment and the legal history of the phrase "high crimes in misdemeanors" to understand it's full meaning to those who live in the realm of constitutional law, you would discover it's not as simple as you want it to be.  Please re-read what I pasted.  

Do you seriously think you have a complete grasp of a phrase with centuries of history, and moreso than actual constitutional law experts?  The discussions I have listened to and articles I have read *were nonpartisan thought experiments*.  That's how intellectual conversations motivated by a desire to acquire more accurate knowledge work.

Again, if you want to continue to delude yourself into thinking you know exactly how this all works, then by all means.  Just don't reply back to me as if you aren't arguing this casually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, that degraded quickly.  The discussions I listened to were nonpartisan, but if you want to delude yourself into thinking that "liberals still can't admit he won", go ahead.  

I take it you didn't look up what the meaning of the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors.  Allow me to do the work for you:

 **"High" in the legal and common parlance** of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries of "high crimes" signifies activity by or against those who have special duties acquired by **taking an oath of office that are not shared with common persons**.[1] A high crime is one that **can only be done by someone in a unique position of authority, which is political in character**, who does things to circumvent justice. The phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors" when used together was a common phrase at the time the U.S. Constitution was written and **did not mean any stringent or difficult criteria for determining guilt. It meant the opposite**. The phrase was historically used to cover a **very broad range of crimes.**  
 
 The constitutional convention adopted high crimes and misdemeanors with little discussion. Most of the framers knew the phrase well.[citation needed] Since 1386, the English parliament had used the term high crimes and misdemeanors to describe one of the grounds to impeach officials of the crown. *Officials accused of high crimes and misdemeanors were accused of offenses as varied as misappropriating government funds, appointing unfit subordinates, not prosecuting cases, not spending money allocated by Parliament, promoting themselves ahead of more deserving candidates, threatening a grand jury, disobeying an order from Parliament, arresting a man to keep him from running for Parliament, losing a ship by neglecting to moor it, helping suppress petitions to the King to call a Parliament, granting warrants without cause, and bribery.* **Some of these charges were crimes. Others were not.** The one common denominator in all these accusations was that the official had somehow abused the power of his office and was unfit to serve.

	<TEXT> I'm basing this off of discussions from experts on constitutional law that I have listened to.  Sure, they could be wrong, but the arguments sounded reasonable to me.  Can you go look up the full meaning of the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors in relation to articles of impeachment?

And no, I said clearly what I meant.  Calling the press the "enemy of the people" can be considered a high crime and misdemeanor.  You are thinking of the word crime in a purely criminal law sense and that's not what it entails. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not trying to let him off the hook for perjury.  But I think you understand my overall point.  

Bashing the free press, specifically to the degree of calling them the enemy of the people, has the potential for impeachment because it can be argued it is a "high crime [and] misdemeanor" under the historical nature of the phrase and because the press is in the Constitution explicitly.

Specifically, it can be argued it is an abuse of power, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming, or intimidation.  

And just as an aside, his claims that Susan Rice committed a crime as NSA and that Barack Obama personally directed an illegal wiretap of him are both "abuses of power" if the claims are untrue (and it appears they are 
indeed false). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeing as how (a) the free press has special protection by virtue of being written into the Constitution, (b) the exact definition of "high crimes and misdemeanors" is sort of broad and open to interpretation (especially when factoring in its historical usage in British law),  and (c) the House impeached Clinton because he had an affair and lied about it, I think so, yes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey look, another Trump adviser with a crystal ball.  With all the Trump-Russia information dropping today this may get lost in the noise, but this is some good work by Reuters.  

 Billionaire investor Carl Icahn's oil refining company, CVR Energy (CVI.N), made a massive bet in 2016 that prices for U.S. government biofuels credits would fall - just before Icahn started advising President Donald Trump on regulations driving that market.

 The size and specifics of the gamble - involving $186 million worth of biofuels credits the company said it needed at the end of 2016 to satisfy regulatory requirements - have not been previously reported by the media.

 The credit system is designed to encourage the mixing of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, into gasoline or diesel. The government awards the biofuels credits to firms that produce such blends - and requires firms that dont, such as CVR, to buy the credits from their competitors.

 Icahn's firm positioned itself to slash those regulatory costs by tens of millions of dollars if biofuels credit prices declined, according to a Reuters review of CVR filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and interviews with two brokers involved in the firms trading of biofuels credits.

 Last year, in a counterintuitive trading strategy, Icahns refining firm postponed buying biofuels credits and instead sold millions of them  a bet that it could buy the credits it would need later at lower prices, according to the two brokers and CVRs year-end SEC filing.

 That strategy looked prescient, starting in December, as prices for biofuels credits fell in response to a series of political events tied to the election of Trump. These included his appointment of Icahn - a vocal critic of biofuels credit mandates - as an unpaid special advisor to the President on regulatory issues. </TEXT>

 The newly obtained records also expand the global scope of Manafort's financial activities related to his Ukrainian political consulting, because both payments came from companies once registered in the Central American country of Belize. Last month, the AP reported that the U.S. government has examined Manafort's financial transactions in the Mediterranean country of Cyprus as part of its probe.  
 ....

 Last month, Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko revealed an invoice bearing the letterhead of Manafort's namesake company, Davis Manafort, that Leshchenko said was crafted to conceal a payment to Manafort as a purchase of 501 computers.

 Leshchenko contended to AP that Yanukovych, as Ukraine's leader, paid Manafort money that came from his government's budget and was "stolen from Ukrainian citizens." He said: "Money received by Manafort has to be returned to the Ukrainian people." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A one-time foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump's presidential campaign lashed out at the "Clinton/Obama regime" after a report published Tuesday said he was the subject of a secret surveillance warrant seeking information about his possible collaboration with Russians to manipulate the 2016 election.
 
 Carter Page told NBC News late Tuesday that he felt he was being targeted because of his support for the Republican presidential candidate and now president.
 
 "There had been prior reports, but I was so happy to hear that further confirmation is now being revealed. It shows how low the Clinton/Obama regime went to destroy our democracy and suppress dissidents who did not fully support their failed foreign policy," Page said.

Amateur gaslighting.  Hasn't anyone told him yet it'd probably be a good idea to stop giving interviews? </TEXT>

Zyklon B, or Hydrogen Cyanide, is a Schedule 3 chemical in the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Do you know it took me about 2 minutes to get this information?

Moreover, using pure deductive reasoning, if a man-made chemical can hurt someone, and someone uses it against another person, that's using a chemical weapon.  If I blast you in the face with RAID, you've just got hit with a chemical weapon.  Where international organizations classify it for scheduling is a different matter, but regardless, Zyklon B is most certainly a chemical weapon.
