	<TEXT>  Here are a few applications that could be facilitated by Snapdragon 835 on-device machine learning tech:

* Photography: Machine learning can aid in scene classification, real-time noise reduction, and object tracking, making it easier to take the perfect shot, or capture video regardless of the conditions.

* VR/AR: With machine learning on your device, VR/AR feature can operate faster and with less lag, so everything from gestures and facial recognition to object tracking and depth perception are an immersive experience.

* Voice detection: Your phones on-device AI can listen for commands and keywords to help you navigate the data and apps on your device more efficiently, and save power doing so.

* Security: With facial recognition software and iris scanning, all operating independently from the cloud, your device can learn to identify, and help protect, you.

* Connections: Your Snapdragon device has the ability to filter out distracting background noise during calls for clearer conversations with friends and family. </TEXT>

 If you insist on inserting yourself or family members into the happy tourist snap, that shouldn't be too much of an imposition, either: just take a bunch of selfies in advance and the software will stitch the two images together for you.

So he notes you can take a picture without needing to use a camera, but here he's recommending you take selfies in  advance (with an actual lens?) in order to get around this tech not being able to capture people as they actually are in the moment. Sorry, but I don't want an image of myself from a totally different day to be inserted into a rather unique shot.  </TEXT>

 Im not a man who wears watches, and Ive never been optimistic about this market. In fact, Ive never figured out why we need to wear smartwatches when everything we need is on our phones.

This is why smartwatches have yet to interest me. There are those who do find benefits in a smartwatch, but in their current state, a smartphone is always the first thing I reach for.

**Edit** for clarification since I keep seeing this brought up: I used a smartwatch (Moto 360 Sport) for a month. Found no need to keep using it afterwards. As I already stated, I'm not saying they're pointless since some people do find them beneficial, but it just didn't work for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In a future version of Android, apps targeting Android O will see Build.SERIAL as "UNKNOWN".

Too early to get the Android P train rolling? 


The change below looks like a response to the security issues brought up in this [ARS Technica article](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/shielding-mac-addresses-from-stalkers-is-hard-android-is-failing-miserably/)

 We collaborated with security researchers to design robust MAC address randomization for Wi-Fi scan traffic produced by the chipset firmware in Google Pixel and Nexus 5X devices. The Android Connectivity team then worked with manufacturers to update the Wi-Fi chipset firmware used by these devices. 

 **Android O integrates these firmware changes into the Android Wi-Fi stack, so that devices using these chipsets with updated firmware and running Android O or above can take advantage of them.**

 Here are some of the changes that we've made to Pixel, Pixel XL and Nexus 5x firmware when running O+: 

 * For each Wi-Fi scan, the phone uses a new random MAC address.
 * The initial packet sequence number for each scan is also randomized.
 * MAC addresses are randomized for all Wi-Fi scans while the device is disconnected from an access point (whether or not the device is in standby).
 * Unnecessary Probe Request Information Elements have been removed: Information Elements are limited to the SSID and DS parameter sets.

	<TEXT>  In my years of reviewing devices, no other smartphone has ever been able to last through my demanding workday like the Z Play can.

The Z Play is a beast in the battery department. Definitely the best battery life I've ever experienced on a phone and it still had many other positive points. Out of all the devices I went through last year, it's one of the ones I miss the most. It'll be interesting to see how Moto follows it up this year.

 . . . but each time Ive switched my SIM into another phone, it ended up back in my Z Play after less than a day. I hope that in the future other device makers will prioritize battery life the way that Moto did here, without compromising the rest of the features that make my smartphone such an indispensable tool. Until then, Ill be sticking with my Z Play.

Damn good endorsement for the Z Play from Dan Seifert. </TEXT>

And thats nice.

Very nice indeed. For those in the market for a new phone and want great value for the money, discounted flagships from last year will still provide a great experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sale icon is common with icon developers. It's not on sale and the app is permanently free. Check out icons from Vertumus. The store icon states "sale 50%" even though $0.99 is the normal price for his icons. It's a tactic used to generate more sales. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2017 devices singled out:

* Sony Xperia XZs/XZ Premium (U.S. fingerprint situation)
* LG G6 (wireless charging and quad dac variants)
* Galaxy S8/S8+ (128GB storage w/ 6GB RAM variant)

The people making these business decisions must have valid reasons for releasing unique market variants, but as a consumer, it kinda sucks knowing there's another model out there of the same phone that would be better suited for my usage. At the same time, I also understand it's mainly an enthusiast problem since regular consumers (in the U.S. at least) likely don't know that there's a G6 model out there with better audio capabilities or an S8 with more storage and ram. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some sections from the article:

 On Thursday, Microsoft added a few details via two emails to Computerworld, saying that the pre-orders apply to S8 and S8+ devices running on the AT T network. Unlocked devices that will work with any carrier are coming "in the future," a spokeswoman added.

 The potential to buy unlocked phones with Windows apps is significant, analysts said, given the 20% or greater savings enterprises can achieve with unlocked smartphones that don't require a service contract. 

 Business users may come out winners in the Samsung-Microsoft arrangement, while both companies expect to benefit as well, analysts said.

 Galaxy S8 customers using the loaded Microsoft productivity apps stand to gain access to Microsoft Azure cloud services, productivity software with Office 365 and enterprise workflow with SharePoint, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz.

 With the new DeX docking station that Samsung announced alongside its new phones, workers could dock a new S8 and run Windows apps on large displays and a full-size keyboard and mouse. And "think about the [many] use cases that DeX [docking station and large screen] will open up for Samsung in the workplace," Goertz said.

 She said: "The Assistant gives a conversational way to access everything Google can do for you, and on the Personality Team we add delight wherever we can.

 "The rest of Google has all the useful parts of the Assistant covered, so the Google Assistant Personality Team really supports them by coming up with fun things the Assistant can say and do, whether that's games or things to discover." </TEXT>

There's no breakdown by their divisions, but supposedly their chip arm had some influence. Will be interesting to see how the following quarter turns out once the S8/S8+ get released. </TEXT>
