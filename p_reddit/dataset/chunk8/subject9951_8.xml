	<TEXT> It helps that i have a separate room out of which i don't really bother getting. Most of my spare time is spent holed up in there with my computer or outside anyway. And of course there's my job too.

Not going to last for much longer now, i hope... </TEXT>

That's the thing that really stings here... </TEXT>
