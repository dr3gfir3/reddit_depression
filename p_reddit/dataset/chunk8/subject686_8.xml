	<TEXT> i get that, i might get it work, but i probably wouldnt. I was just wondering if the companies that do this kind of work on a regular basis, bought the basic designs and then remoded them, or do you actually have to measure every micrometer of the factory slide, if you want to do anything with it? (i'm really an amateur when it comes to this stuff) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its not really pain, but really hyper sensitivity. It does not hurt but its very very unpleasant. 

When its good, its because my penis is well lubed. Only then I get really great sensation from it.

Sometimes i envy uncircumcised guys and i wonder how would sex and everything else feel.
I also had some problems with premature ejaculation due to being more sensitive, but this can be avoided with regular sex.  </TEXT>
