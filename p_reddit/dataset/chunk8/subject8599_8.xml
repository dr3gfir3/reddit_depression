	<TEXT> As Republicans have tried to find a health-care bill on which they can reach a consensus, Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) agreed to support an amendment that would allow states to again permit insurance providers to deny coverage to people who have preexisting conditions, as long as that state set up high-risk pools that would provide coverage to those in poor health who cannot get traditional insurance. Democrats, along with many Republicans, have argued that insurance providers in all states should continue to be required to cover people with preexisting conditions, a popular mandate that many Republicans had promised to continue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Earlier this month May surprised financial markets and political rivals by saying she would look to hold an early election on June 8 to strengthen her hand in Brexit talks.

Speaking in television interviews on Sunday she sought to portray her party as the stable option capable of delivering a good Brexit deal, but noted that EU leaders' attitudes showed there would be difficult talks ahead.

Sterling has risen on the prospect of May winning an election, but a further tightening in poll ratings might generate more uncertainty over what Britain's position will be when it sits down in June to begin negotiations in earnest.

"Today's opinion polls ... perhaps are just a little bit of a warning to the Conservatives," polling expert John Curtice told Sky television </TEXT>

	<TEXT> British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday divorce talks with the European Union would be difficult, responding to the tough stance taken by EU leaders over the upcoming Brexit negotiations.

EU leaders endorsed stiff divorce terms for Britain on Saturday and warned Britons to have "no illusions" about swiftly securing a new relationship to keep their access to EU markets.

"What this shows, and what some of the other comments we've seen coming from European leaders shows, is that there are going to times when these negotiations are going to be tough," May told the BBC. </TEXT>
