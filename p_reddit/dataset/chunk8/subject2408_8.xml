	<TEXT> About the tension aspect, I don't think there was supposed to be. It's supposed to be a conclusion to Shinji's character arc. It's also supposed to be isolated from the rest of the show, it's taking place during Instrumentality after all. 

About skipping out on what happened, I sort of agree, but I don't mind it either. The series was never about the actual fights, it was about the impact they had on the characters and with the culmination of that, we skip the fun bits entirely and focus on the characters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved Hyouka more and more with each passing episode. I kept thinking about various aspects of it a lot after I finished and a month or two after that, I rewatched it, and confirmed just how much I loved it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kaiba is not exactly post-apocalyptic but it's dystopian. It's dark and twisted, but in a different way from Attack on Titan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, to be honest, I like these more than EoE as well. It resolves the main thematic conflict in the show, and so does EoE but personally I prefer the way they do it here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most fans seem to really dislike these episodes and prefer EoE. Personally, I think they work together. These dive into the minds of what the characters were experiencing while going through instrumentality while the movie focuses on the actual events surrounding Instrumentality. I know the movie has those elements too, but it handles them differently enough that I feel like these two episodes are worth the watch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I love Viral's alternate reality, I don't get what exactly the alternate realities were supposed to represent. For Viral, it was a dream that would never come true, and for the other minor characters, it seems to be similar; it's something that they want. But foe Simon and Yoko, it's different. Simon is in a reality with a much more cowardly Kamina and Yoko's is kinda random, though all the possibilities show her as satisfied in life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hyouka has a lot of great visual storytelling. If you guys haven't read them, you should read wrongeverytime's posts on his website that talk about some of the techniques used in each episode. I suspect a large reason why fans of Hyouka like it so much is because of its visual storytelling. </TEXT>
