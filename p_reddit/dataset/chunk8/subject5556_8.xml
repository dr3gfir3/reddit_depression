	<TEXT> I agree--it's much like how a full-Internet-serving, photo-and-video-capable smartphone become what we now understand as a "phone," while the previous decades concept of a phone is now called a "landline." I recently saw someone say that people should stop saying "flatscreen TV" and just say "TV," just as people stopped saying "color TV" in the late 1960s. 

 It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.

I thought that too, and I think that author purposely says "blockchain" in the headline because there are so many kneejerk anti-Bitcoin readers out there who tune out as soon as they see the word. Incidentally, those same people also don't seem to know or understand what the blockchain is; they blur Bitcoin together with all sorts of online scams. I know a guy who's been saying that "Bitcoin is Bitbullshit" for years; in fact, he even wrote that statement in an email on January 28, 2013, when Bitcoin was at $19.87, amusingly (as that was the year of the big stock market crash of the '80s).

	<TEXT> That's not me, it was just a video I found, but yeah, I noticed that too! There are drummers who definitely drum that way. I actually read a Neil Peart interview many years ago where he was saying how he studied with some drumming master who taught him to play more mindfully of the upward rebound after every stroke. Something like "Always make sure to be constantly bringing it back up every single time." This is almost analogous to how people who've been walking around for a while won't lift their feet as high as they keep going.

	<TEXT> Yeah, the app right now is definitely for younger users, immature and flighty users. Even in their IPO roadshow video (linked below), they talk first first a 13-34 demographic, but then divide it in half and say how the younger half is far more engaged, and also uses traditional media far less.

 I just can't comprehend how this can result in higher time engagement with the platform compared to the likes of Twitter where you literally have stream after stream after stream of content and comments to read.

Then you also simply don't know or haven't seen just how short the average teenager's attention span is, and how they are constantly onto the next thing--AND how relentless narcissistic and exhibitionistic they are. Even when Evan Spiegel introduced the idea for the app to his classmates at Stanford, the reaction was that it an optimal sexting app, and now it's made for both photos AND videos. I mean, I remember seeing an interview in the '90s where Spike Lee was complaining about how music videos were partly to blame for how movies cut angles and scenes so frequently: "It's like cut, cut, cut." I also know from several years ago that *Spongebob Squarepants* cartoons cut scenes more frequently than any other cartoon, and of course it's cutting away to all sorts of absurd and unrelated things. The article was saying that such programming can exacerbate ADD and ADHD in kids. 

Snapchat users are communicating with each other through the app. And that's the fundamental concept of it, as Evan Spiegel says at the start of this roadshow video, as he weaves together the evolution of the camera with the evolution of the keyboard-connected desktop computer. And just think about the very name: snap + chat = photo-talking--and now also video-clip-talking. 

You need click "I agree" to watch it:

http://snap.netroadshow.com/retail/disclaimer.aspx

I myself still own a flip phone, but I see Snap as being a hugely successful company. They have 4 products: 

- The **Snapchat** app, which has dozens of celebrities using and therefore promoting it 

http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/feature/a820463/celebrity-snapchat-usernames/

http://www.capitalfm.com/music-news/celebrity-popstar-snapchat-usernames/

http://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Celebrities-Snapchat-37914299

(MTV is even trying to guilt-trip Taylor Swift into joining: http://www.mtv.com/news/2918852/taylor-swift-needs-snapchat/)

- The **Bitmoji** app, which has been the #1 iPhone app for 6 whole weeks now - From Wednesday Jan 11 to Wednesday Feb 22) -

https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/top/united-states/overall/iphone/

And the #1 iPhone utility for over 7 months now -

You can create an AppAnnie account and see the history:

- And then Snap has **Spectacles** - with nearly 5,000 pairs being sold on eBay in the past 90 days, and look at how much money people have been spending on them--with the higher prices being in November, due to the scarcity effect:

http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?LH_Complete=1 LH_Sold=1 _from=R40 _sacat=0 _nkw=Snapchat+Spectacles _sop=16

- And then there's the **SnapPhone** that they are apparently developed with Google--it's no accident that these designs made by some independent company have been picked up by major news websites:

	<TEXT> *Notably:*

 At the time of its IPO, Snap has less revenues than any of its peer group, other than LinkedIn, and is losing more money than any of them. Before you view this is a death knell for Snap, one reason for Snaps big losses is that unlike its competitors, Snap pays for server space as it acquires new users, thus pushing up its operating expenses (and pushing down capital investment in servers). There is one other dimension where Snap measures up more favorably against at least two of the other companies: **its users are spending more time on its platform that they were either on Twitter and LinkedIn, and it ranks second only to Facebook on this dimension.**

 This document describes techniques and devices for radar-based gesture-recognition through a wearable device. The techniques enable an easy-to-use input interface through this wearable radar device, in contrast to small or difficult-to-use input interfaces common to wearable computing devices. Further, these techniques are not limited to interfacing with wearable computing devices, but may aid users in controlling various non-wearable devices, such as to control volume on a stereo, pause a movie playing on a television, or select a webpage on a desktop computer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still own and use a flip phone and I have zero desire to ever buy a smartphone, let alone smartglasses. I just wanted to get the word out to everyone that the Spectacles were for sale as soon as I saw that they were, through someone who pointed it out on Twitter at that moment. I didn't know who might be interested, so I announced it in a bunch of different subs and let the chips fall where they may.

	<TEXT> I think Google will nevertheless happily add it to their current Android phones, of which are there are no fewer than 10 vaunted up on the Android homepage: the LG G5, HTC 10, HTC Bolt, LG V20, Pixel (that Google's *own* phone), Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Sony Xperia XZ, Moto X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus 5X! And I think it'll sell well, and that the whole "Snap" branding and corresponding design is one reason, as shallow as that may seem.
 
https://www.android.com/phones/

I also predict that Spectacles will be huge; the demand shown on eBay and the prices paid for them is just one reason I say that: While I dn't know how many were purchases from the "Snapbots," you can see that over 5,000 pairs have been sold in the past 90 days, and here they are, in descending price order, with 54 being bought for between $500-599, and another 106 being bought for between $400-499:
