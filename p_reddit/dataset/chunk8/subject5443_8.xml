He didn't ouch on at all the elephant in room, especially in America, race. He didn't dare try and justify the use of the word n*gger and there's a good reason for that. It's a word of hate, used as a weapon to dehumanize others. People are rightly condemned for using it. These days racists use the term 'political correctness' as a shield to hide behind, I'm looking at you Donald Trump, to protect them from what they see as unfair criticism. </TEXT>

It helped me heal the wound, perhaps it might help you. I think perfectionism is a big part of OCD, we want so bad to be morally perfect human beings that we torture ourselves over small infractions and obsess about the possibility of becoming some extreme example of moral depravity. Remind yourself it's okay to be imperfect, everybody is, it's a fundamental part of being human. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I experience a lot of guilt as well primarily about breakdowns due to OCD and not living my life to the full and feeling not good enough.  I recovered from OCD once and then had a breakdown because I brought on a spike.  I felt endless guilt over that plus a fear of repeating the mistake. I read something that ended with you can choose to love and forgive yourself. So I wrote down everything about the episode and at the end wrote I choose to love and forgive myself for that. It helped a lot. Maybe you could do something similar with the episodes that haunt you? Also meditation gives me a lot of relief from ocd, I always promote it for that reason, here's a[ link](http://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#guided-meditations) to some guided meditations, there's one of practising self compassion, which may be good for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is part of a bizarre and cynical trend with this government. They take personal positions in public against the results of their policies yet continue to support and implement those policies. Varadkar has been deploring the the trolley crisis since he became health minister, Kenny did the same this week, but when they had the chance to do something about it in the budget, they decided to give everyone a few quid instead in the hopes of buying the election. Beware of this stuff, talk is cheap.

edit: words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I've suffered from ocd and depression for a many years. I got over the depression but the ocd is harder to shake. The thing I've found best for anxiety is meditation, it helps you come to terms with your mind and fears. This a[ link](http://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#guided-meditations) to some guided meditations if you want to give it a try. You can get better, believe me. </TEXT>
