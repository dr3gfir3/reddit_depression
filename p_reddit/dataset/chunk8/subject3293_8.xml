	<TEXT> I hit 4 months today and none of my shoes feel comfortable enough except for my doc marten sandals, but I can't wear them out in the garden, so I scooped up these crocs. I don't even care how ugly they are, just so stoked on the sweet comfort and utility.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should have him look into holistic grazing. There are ways of raising animals which mimic the ecosystem functions of herbivores. Every ecosystem on earth is crucially dependent on animals. No creature on earth can live separate from this natural cycle. Also, "veganic" farming is a myth. Even conventional vegetable production happens at the expense of catastrophic ecosystem destruction ( loss of habitat for animals) in order to grow mono cultures of single crops. If you want to eat vegetables that are grown in healthy ecosystems, there will be animals involved, in a holistic fashion, i.e. Permaculture and organic small farms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha that was my exact interpretation of her bullshit! She was so pissed when it turned out to be an awesome day, despite her best efforts to sabotage! This last thanksgiving 2015, Luanne group texts everyone in our family the 1st week of September stating "let's all go for Chinese food this Thanksgiving!" And I fire back "lol MIL, it's not even Halloween yet, but just so you know I'm planning on hosting Thanksgiving this year since it was obviously too stressful for you last year to deal with". 

So we had it at our tiny little apartment (sweet old landlady was out of town on business), and of course our dear family friends were invited. Luanne of course proceeds to show up two hours late, drink herself into a stupor and bitch about how our plates are "too small" and how she "just can't believe this is the new family tradition". Immediately after she finishes her food, she says "have fun cleaning up!" and orders doormat Dale to driver her home because she "doesn't feel well". 

Oh yeah, and all she brought to dinner was two bottles of wine, which she drank one of herself, and took the other home with her. Also, before I realized what was happening, she also took nearly all the leftover turkey and side dishes home, so we ended up with no leftovers, which is the best part. So she still ended up managing to fuck us over... Grrrr!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lousy Luanne (almost) ruins Thanksgiving </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-07 23:23:15 </DATE>

	<TEXT> My inlaws moved across the country to be close to us (aka meddle with our lives) in October 2014. They had been living in a motel for the past month while searching for an apartment that lived up to Luanne's impossible standards, and ended up moving into their apartment just two weeks before Thanksgiving. 


Since no one else had offered by the time November rolled around, and my inlaws still didn't have a place yet, I had  planned to host Thanksgiving for the family (my husband, his two cousins, my inlaws, and some close friends). I invited everyone, then when my inlaws moved into their new place,  Lousy Luanne throws her weight and insists on changing the plans so she can host it herself at their apartment, where they haven't even unpacked and they don't even have a table to sit at. Since I was just getting to know them, I politely agreed and wanted to honor their family traditions and totally understood that Luanne would want to host her family. 

Lousy Luanne says family only, no family friends (who had been with us for all previous holidays)... So trying to honor her wishes, I uninvited our friends, which was horribly awkward! I insisted that Luanne make an exception for our landlady, who is actually a dear friend of ours and is elderly and always alone on the holidays, so she usually spends them with us! Luanne is not happy about this inclusion for no apparent reason other than wanting to be in control of everything all the time. 

Fast forward three weeks to Thanksgiving morning. We are supposed to get together at 3 for dinner. Fucking Luanne calls my DH at 9am crying that she is "too stressed to host Thanksgiving after all" and cancels the dinner!!! Apparently one of the main reasons Luanne flaked was because she just "couldn't stand to have a stranger at a family dinner" (meaning our sweet old landlady)

Not knowing what else to do, my husband and I quickly try to get shit together to host at our place and luckily, our sweet old landlady (who lives next door and has a much bigger kitchen and house) saved the day by allowing us to have everyone over at her place instead at the last minute! So my DH and cousin drive over to get the turkey and  we all hustle our asses off to pull together a decent dinner. Since I was now hosting, I called our family friends and re-invited them over, explaining that MIL is apparently batshit insane!

So we manage to get dinner all ready by 4 somehow, and our amazing family friends bring over their dinner to join with ours, also totally saving the day!! We managed to have a feast prepared! And who decides not to show up until nearly 6? Goddamn Lousy Luanne and my poor FIL, doormat Dale. 

The whole dinner Luanne drinks and sulks and pouts about how she can't believe we are "having a new tradition now". Fuck you Luanne!!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She is generally always saying something inappropriate, whether in restaurants or to whoever, but it's very often directed at me. My husband has tried to call her out on it and she says she is "just so nervous trying to please your wife" that she accidentally says mean things all the time. When we call her out on it in the moment she always says "I didn't mean it like that" or "I'm sorry you misunderstood me". I'm not falling for it though, if someone consistently treats me poorly, there's not much to misunderstand!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Introducing Lousy Luanne </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-07 07:50:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is my first time posting, but I've been visiting this sub for solace for months! I'll call my MIL "Lousy Luanne". DH and I have been married only a few years, but I have many stories to share about Luanne and her lousy behavior, which has only increased since she and my FIL moved across the country to be "closer to us", aka meddle with our lives constantly. I'll dub my FIL "Doormat Dale" for now, as he is the classic sweet guy but a total pushover who enables the hell out of Lousy Luanne. 

I'll get into some more stories later, but for now, I'll stick with some ultra light Luanne BS that occurred tonight. 

I am 13 weeks pregnant, which is relevant to the story. So DH and I go to dinner at Luanne and Dan's  tonight with DH's two cousins. We walk in and Lousy Luanne makes a big fuss over her niece and nephew and son, gives all a big hug, but does not hug me or even acknowledge me with a hello. Then she asks if anyone wants a drink (Luanne has already likely had several drinks before we arrived, her favorite lately being straight vodka). 

She says "I've got this kind of beer and then I have some apple juice for the party pooper" referring to me. She says it in a mean way, not as a joke, as she gestures towards me. My DH (who has been trying to stick up for me more) says "what is that supposed to mean mom?" And she tries to back peddle by saying "well, I didn't mean it like that, it's just that she's pregnant, so she's a party pooper". 

So apparently because I'm not drinking while I'm pregnant with her GRANDBABY, that makes me a party pooper. 

This alone wouldn't be so bad, it's just a small example of the lousy things Luanne says on the regular. More stories to follow!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like we're in a similar position! I'm warming up to he name myself, but I agree it's a lot of name to grow into! I like Uly for the same reason, it's a very soft nickname to contrast the larger than life Ulysses. It's funny though because my husband thinks of Ulysses  as "whimsical", which I don't quite get at first impression.  </TEXT>
