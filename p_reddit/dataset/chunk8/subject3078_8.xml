	<TEXT>  It appears the public are more interested in how well our PM speaks so why not watch them do that at a time people can tune in? 

Because it reduces the election campaign to a contest between two people which it isn't. We end up electing people on the basis that they are slightly more likeable than the other chap whilst feeling well informed, when it turns out that the person we actually elect is potentially very different, and that maybe the TV debates don't cover enough to actually make a sensible decision. Or, as someone said elsewhere, for existing party supporters, it's basically an opportunity to cheer someone on.

If they want to do televised debates then fine, lets have debates,but every candidate in the GE should have the opportunity to take part in one, we have local TV channels, we could make that happen... It'd be far more useful than what we've seen in the past in terms of TV debates. </TEXT>

Yeah this basically.

At one point they stopped under 18's doing armed guard duties (Issued with a pick-axe handle instead, because apparently shooting someone is more traumatic than having to bludgeon them to death..), and were already fairly clear about under 18's not being deployable.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, and even then I doubt it would work as it did in Germany. The culture has no experience with democracy, you have the "kaffirs on muslim land" problem, and so on.

Germany didn't exactly have a long period of actual democracy before WWII either, and had a tiny problem with varying ethnicities if memory serves.  There is no good reason to suggest that a democratic state is not possible in Middle eastern states...

We don't need to separate these groups. Europe has taken in enough refugees for the next 10 years at least. 

Yeah, we do, because refugees move on the basis of need, which makes them significantly different from people migrating for any other reason. There isn't some sort of arbitrary limit at which point our moral responsibilities, based on our own value systems simply cease to exist.

The criterion for admission should be based on one factor alone: is it beneficial for Europe to allow this person in.

For migration I'd agree with you. For asylum the factor should be risk.

Continuing to let in millions per year is going to end in civil war.

No, it's not. However it is unsustainable, but then how many of the people entering Europe are refugees?

False again. Germany and the UK give refugees full welfare benefits, and Sweden, Canada, Netherlands are other examples. Most countries do this, in fact. Most countries also allow refugees to work.


See, this is where the difference between migrant and refugee is important again. Your initial statement, in relation to migrants generally was:

They often get more than citizens on welfare

That isn't true. In the UK, asylum seekers get very little support [see here](https://www.gov.uk/asylum-support/what-youll-get) until their asylum claim is complete, when their asylum claim is complete they get the same access to the welfare state as anyone else in the same situation, not more, and it will take anything up to 6 months to get a decision on your status. If you are not an asylum seeker, but a migrant without a valid visa or similar, or if your asylum application isn't approved, you have no access to the welfare state.

Are you aware of Europe's history? 

Yes... Some of it isn't too pretty, hence why countries in Europe pushed protections of refugees and international frameworks that mandate support.

Nor should it be part of Europe's values to save idiots who do stupid things all over the world, which then gives many more people the incentive to do the same stupid thing.

Is anyone suggesting that? 

I do not advocate for repatriation of migrants. I only advocate for stopping the inflow so we actually have a chance to integrate those already here.

And I'd advocate for the repatriation of migrants that don't have a valid claim through the immigration system, as well as failed asylum seekers, where it is possible. On the other side of that, I think not letting people drown in the sea is generally a good idea, and for those who make it to Europe they should be able to go through a process to determine whether they are entitled to support as a refugee or not..

You seem keener to see people, including people who really are fleeing for their lives die and just let anyone who has made it so far to remain under whatever circumstances.. That seems really daft and incredibly amoral.

	<TEXT> I do remember one January morning somewhere on a southern English plain where we, after a relaxing advance to contact, enjoyed the most wonderful company attack, followed by a long leisurely lope through the beautiful scenery with a casualty on an improvised stretcher. 

I should set the scene a little though, the evening before, by the light of the moon (and some way into the morning if memory serves), we had dug ourselves a nice.. well, it was a trench by the time people were happy, in some wonderfully luminous chalk.  It was beautiful, you could see us (covered in chalk dust) and the position for miles until we got it properly covered and got everyone cleaned up again, like angels in the night, gorgeous, you'd have loved it. 

Now half the reason we ended up digging for so long was that we had a rather tall member of the section, and one rather short member, so to accommodate both comfortably some beautiful person suggested that we take that into consideration in our nocturnal excavations. 

Then, early in the morning the word came down, collect in your trip flares and be prepared to move off a little before dawn. That is so considerate when you think about it, you get a chance to appreciate the ice that has formed on your shemagh and that crisp feeling your bivvy bag has in those early hours, not to mention that you'll see a glorious sunrise, behind you, through a thin veil of smoke.  Glorious.

Anyway, after completing our morning enjoyments, we were informed that one of our number had fainted from the beauty of it all, and would need to be carried aloft in an improvised manner, to a destination that was beyond a small, picturesque and no doubt snow fed and crystal clear stream.  Happily it was our second stoutest member who was prone, so we knew it wouldn't require much exertion on our part, and yes, whilst his kit was inexplicably heavier than expected, our morale and spirits were high as we set off.

It was only once we had borne him aloft that we realised the fatal flaw in our endeavours. Trying to carry a svelte 16 stone beauty on an creatively improvised stretcher, when you have a nimble 4ft2 hobbit on one corner, and a sturdy 6ft6 Adonis  on another requires careful consideration of inclines and stride length to avoid calamity.  Coordination that is sometimes  a tad lacking after no sleep and a little physical exertion.. 

Oh and it also turns out if you drop the 16 stone bloke onto the 4ft2 chap whilst trying to crossing a freezing river, your mock casevac can almost turn into a real one.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think this can work. We can occupy one or maybe two countries, and there would already be difficulties as there were in Iraq. We cannot occupy half the world. It would also fuel "muh kaffirs on muslim lands" and given the muslim population in Europe that wouldn't end well. It would need to be a 50+ year occupation before the country could stand on its own, and I don't think 50 years is even enough.

I'm not suggesting that we occupy anyone, but rather that had we approached the invasion of Iraq more like the liberation of Germany and Japan after WWII it might not have been such a disaster afterwards, although it would have involved a massive occupation. 

And we could absolutely have done so, it'd have cost a massive amount, involved massive numbers of soldiers, probably a draft etc.. 

For migration the solution is easy. Stop giving lifelong handouts and stop people at the border.

For migration that isn't related to asylum that's broadly right. For asylum, where people are actively fleeing war it is somewhat different.

Did they join a terrorist group? Libya was 1000x better under Gaddafi than now, unless you're part of a terrorist group.

No, one was a civil engineer, I think he's dead now. They went back because they left after having issues with the regime, so I suppose for them specifically it wasn't possible to live in Libya whilst Gaddafi was in power, and they hoped and wanted to make the country better once he had gone. Clearly that didn't happen.

Nonsense. They travel through 15 safe countries for a reason. They even risk their life on a boat in order to go from one safe country to a richer safe country.

Some do, some do less.  You have migrants from all over the place (some that are from safe countries in the first place) mixed in with people who are refugees and from very much not safe countries. The latter (taking the central, and eastern Mediterranean routes are passing through countries like Turkey, Egypt and Libya to get to Europe. I think we need to separate people fleeing from war, from people who are simply looking for a better country to live in though, economic migration and refugees are different problems at the end of the day, and whether you can stay in Europe does depend heavily where you fall between those groups.

Blatantly false. In most countries the refugees get into the same welfare programs as citizens, plus extras.

Which ones? Last I looked it was quite a lot less, Germany and the UK certainly do (and they are usually pointed at as being generous..). I'm also reasonably sure that refugees generally don't qualify for the same welfare programmes and depending on country, many are not allowed to work either.

Nope, let people die if they are stupid enough to get on a boat. This will much reduce the total number of deaths in the long term.

I doubt it'd reduce the number of deaths, but it simply letting some proportion of people drown in the sea absolutely would be a reversal of centuries of tradition and values on the side of Europe. It doesn't fit into the 'European values' thing, the 'Christian values' thing, or even the western values thing really does it?  I mean sure, advocate for removal and repatriation for migrants and camps for refugees with the intention of later return, protect borders etc.. that all just about fits, but let people die when we could help? Doesn't sound right to me, maybe I don't know the right people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, speeding fines bring in less money than the budget's allocated to the traffic police by a fairly large margin, so I'm not sure how much the money is actually a driver for government, it's something like 80p per person across the whole country per year at the moment, and this change is hardly going to drive it up (especially if it stops a few people speeding too..), it's 30x less than say Air passenger duty for example, and (as people point out) it's entirely avoidable.

It's also worth noting that the fines and points are bigger on slower roads. 20mph over in a 30 will net you 6 points or a 28 day disqualification, and 75-125% of your weekly pay, whilst 20mph over on the motorway will get you 3 points and a fine of 25-75% of weekly pay.  Which seems somewhat sensible in context (although again, I think there should be some thought on whether 70 is a reasonable limit..).

The bigger issue really is whether it reduces speeding, and whether trying to reduce speeding on roads like motorways is a good idea or whether there should be changes to the limits instead.

It's probably also relevant that the police will also treat speeding differently, you are far less likely to end up with a dangerous driving charge for driving too fast on the motorway than if you were driving far too fast on some other road.

Given that both end up on your license for roughly the same amount of time, I'd be willing to bet that they'd be treated fairly similarly to be honest. I'd assume it'd have the same impact on their risk assessments (as it's the same risk..) at which point it'd depend on your insurer.

	<TEXT> The biggest issue with our motorways isn't speed, it's lane discipline and following distance.

Yeah, agreed on that.. On Tuesday this week I was in the right hand lane behind (I think it was a Qashqai btw..) a car that was slowly, as in 67, maybe, overtaking a lorry.  Some tit in a Merc 4x4 decided I wasn't going quickly enough, undertook me, realised the lorry was going slower than they'd anticipated and then dived into my stopping space with maybe 5m clearance between me, and indeed the lorry..  Of course he then had to brake hard to avoid rear-ending the car in front (leaving me to slam my brakes on, happily with room behind as he'd vacated the space..).  It's utterly insane, leaving a reasonable stopping distance seems to be taken by some as an invitation to dive into it, and moving back into the middle or right hand lane seems to be a real problem for a lot of drivers (although I have been guilty of 'notional' lane changes on the motorway when I've had nothing behind me and I can see I'm going to have to pull out again in a few minutes..).

 Germany is generally much better for this, and I've driven on the Autobahn with cars doing 200kmh+ and it seems to flow much better than most UK motorways, and most drivers seem to keep a good distance.

It can be, around the cities it can be just as bad though, with Audi's being happy to sit 2m behind your bumper rather than overtaking when you are already travelling at a reasonable speed.  That said, the fast lane tends to work quite well, although speed differentials can get a bit silly at times. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This is very much the point. I've made it a point of habit to drive every journey as if I had 12 points on the licence (I don't).

Ha, to be fair, 12 points would (generally, IIRC) mean you shouldn't be driving, but I get your point.

The difficulty is that 20 limits are very poorly obeyed. The council recently had a public consultation asking if my road should be a 20 limit - A long, straight road, 10 m wide (wider than many single carriageway roads), built up on only one side, the primary road serving a large residential area, with large pavements on both sides. One of the things they put in the "benefits" was reduced road speed, but they didn't specify what the reduction was. So, I asked what their historical data was, and they replied: Median vehicle speed dropped from 35 to 32 mph after converting 30 limits to 20 limits. 91% of vehicles exceeded the 20 mph limit after it had come into force. To me, that doesn't sound like the limit doesn't have public buy-in. Moreover, limits have tended to be used to provide protection for specific hazards, and serve to warn the driver of a higher risk ahead. The worry here is that this type of inappropriate limit merely teaches drivers that limits are arbitrary and not there for a purpose.

Agreed entirely. I make an effort to drive at 20 in 20's, but it's sometimes really problematic. Where I am at least, given it's a little hilly, and the 20's generally apply (as you point out..) to what are fairly large roads, with pavements (and often trees and grass sections too) and a lot of people treat them as 30's and drive over 30..  That shouldn't be a problem, but it does throw people off on junctions, and I've had people overtake me (which arguably is more of a problem again..), not to mention that if I don't pay attention to my speed somewhat rigorously you find yourself back at 30 fairly quickly..  

I think I prefer the approaches I've seen in Germany and France with play streets, and nice street furniture and calming measures (Rather than nasty speed bumps and odd priority shifts, if nothing else, just the signage puts you in mind of kids playing, rather than a road safety campaign.  And yes, the arbitrary aspect really is what causes issues, if drivers see it as safe, and don't see the rules enforced (often the case with 20's) the chances of adherence are basically nil (as your stats above suggest).

I'd take that a little further too, there seems to be (again, on a council by council basis..) a massive rush toward signage that isn't appropriate, huge 'Slow' warnings, and chevrons before corners that can safely be driven at the speed limit cause people to slow unnecessarily and lull people into a false sense of security when they come to a corner that actually does require you to slow down significantly for.  That's more noticeable on roads you know obviously (I drive the Snake pass quite regularly and there are a quite a few excessive signing issues on the safe bits, and arguably too little warning on some of the more problematic corners...  And to anyone else who does that road regularly, or somewhat irregularly, the 30 near where the road has slipped and created a ramp is there because at about 30 or more you get tossed off the side of a hill if you aren't careful..).

Oh and maybe I'm just getting old, but the level of reflectiveness of some of those signs has now reached a point where they seem to be a hazard all on their own at night..

But I digress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Slightly amusingly I live on one road of a triangle that is essentially two small residential roads coming off a more major one, with more housing beyond it.  The major road and all the housing on the other side is a 20 zone, our little triangle was left out of the 20 zone, so we have big 30 signs at the entrance. It's a bizarre set up (although cars parked on both sides of the road most of the time make 20, never mind 30 somewhat optimistic..   I'd hate to know what it cost to put in the posts and signs (both sides of course..) rather than simply extending the 20 across two more entirely residential streets that go nowhere.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> are, on the whole, places where the Labour administrations have solid achievements that they can take back to the electorate to show for their work come polling day.

There are issues in Manchester too though, you have a majority labour council that is essentially having to create opposition internally because some poor decisions don't get challenged otherwise.  There is a bit of a lack of consultation (and the catch 22 of consultation often not providing a lot of feedback until you hit actual protests...) but mostly people see and remember failures more than they do successes.

Communicating those successes more effectively would go a long way though, even if it is only to solidify support that already exists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is somewhat true in lots of areas with Labour majority councils, in Sheffield the whole 'tree felling' thing, as minor as it may seem, seems to have caused quite a bit of resentment (alongside the more common and nagging issues around road conditions - which are legitimately awful, my road has apparently 'failed' -, bin collections and library provision etc.. which you could at least largely ascribe to central government funding).  I can't see opinion swinging Tory, but a lot of people seem to be considering voting Green and indeed Lib Dem, or for minor left wing parties to send a message.  Now that doesn't really make a lot of sense (council decisions and parliamentary ones not being the same, and we have a good, solid Labour MP..) but it is a concern, especially if, as I've heard a few times now, people are also seeing the election result as a foregone conclusion and so voting 'not labour' is can be seen as safe because voting labour won't make a difference on the national level..

Not great times, and at least party the fault of complacency and a bit of a failure to communicate successes, even when that is just mitigating Tory fuckery. </TEXT>

I don't think traffic offences are part of the crime statistics that you see regularly (although I'm sure there are statistics for traffic offences..). It's not like they add 1 crime+1 cleanup for each speeding ticket.

	<TEXT> Now they start collecting money at 21mph

I don't think that has actually changed. The fines always technically started at 1mph over the speed limit, the point at which it was enforced was discretionary (I think by police force) and the consensus was, and I think still is 10%.

Its much safer to do 80mph now than it was to do 70mph in the 70s.

That's probably more the issue, we have motorways where it is absolutely safe to drive over 70, but no government seems keen on raising limits even where it would arguably be sensible to do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also those stupid temporary speed warnings they put up in which half of the traffic tries to abide and the rest just ignore it.

I do wonder if that isn't actively dangerous at times, I've seen people in the middle and right lanes brake quite rapidly where a 40 limit has suddenly appeared (animals in road.. I remember it fairly vividly as half the traffic went mental, although no animals as far as I could tell..). Although for sensible issues (like animals in the road...) I suppose you haven't got a massive number of options, possibly 'Slow to 40' rather than putting up a 40 (which would usually apply at the sign...).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is very true, although it's not unreasonable to get a little upset when there are arbitrary restrictions not related to safety or road condition.  I think Derbyshire is very keen on 50 limits on roads you'd normally expect to be 60's for examples (whilst parts of the south west seem to go stupid in the other direction...). To be honest I'd be happier with the somewhat random limits if my local council didn't essentially use the lack of road maintenance as a traffic calming measure...

Still, if you don't want a fine, as you say, don't break the speed limit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ha, the major 3 lane A road (and ring road..) near where I am is 30 for a very large section, even where it doesn't seem appropriate (50 I could understand..), so I feel your pain.  The best part about that is that the lights are essentially timed for people going 30, but it seems (according to people that I have spoken to but don't know well...) that 60 works just as well.

That said a year or so ago, heading toward Dover from Sheffield at about 2am on the A1 (possibly...), almost no traffic and a reasonable road (I assume the limit was 70) and I had a police traffic car pull the car in front of me that was probably speeding a little.  I saw the reflective strips on the slip road, I'm guessing the chap in front didn't and the police car basically immediately put his pretty blue lights on as he got onto the A road.  You do sort of wonder at that time in the morning, when it's dry and there is no other traffic whether there is any real public benefit.

Still, break the limit and take your chances to a certain extent. And even in Germany you seem to hit fairly arbitrary (and often very arbitrary..) limits on the motorways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might just be me, but I quite like French motorways in general. Two lanes and decent lane discipline seems to lead to generally faster traffic flows with the same amount of traffic as 3 lanes and people sitting in the middle lane at 65, being overtaken by people doing 67..  Although the whole issue of lorries overtaking on dual carriageways (even if it does make sense to the lorry drivers) is a pain in the UK that I don't think I noticed as much in France.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can't wait for driverless cars to be common enough that any poor bastard like me can get one.

I sort of wonder what the impact on electric and driver-less cars will be on the second hand market. 

The cost of replacing batteries in the former, especially 3-5 years after new may make them an expensive prospect. As to driverless cars, once they drop out of their warranty periods, or if they need updates/upgrades/contracts to keep them on the road legally you might see availability of used vehicles, at least of that type, drop too.  The manufacturers would also have almost no motivation to do anything about that, after all, a smaller used car market would be better for them than the current situation.

The only system that does make sense is the one you present in your last paragraph, although I can see that being more expensive than owning a cheap second hand car, even if it is cheaper than owning a new one.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think there is a bit of an imbalance.. I agree with low speed limits in residential areas, it does make it safer for kids and everyone else walking around, but quite a few stretches of A road, and large sections of motorway have flows of traffic that broadly exceed the 70 limit a lot of the time (essentially when there isn't massive congestion..) and modern cars are safe at higher speeds too.  Getting the balance right is really the key bit, I doubt that most people want to do 40 in residential areas, but they also don't want to be stuck doing 70 on long, straight, safe roads where they could safely be travelling quite a bit faster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. My oldest two kids have had phones since they were 12 (going to secondary school on foot or via public transport - depending on whether they are trying to save their bus fares or not - made being able to contact them more useful than not..), but they aren't new phones and they don't have data connections..

That seems fairly reasonable, taking advantage of the benefits of being able to contact them without having to worry too much about cost etc.. I also generally think it's important that when they go out to play or similar that they aren't always on a tether, so apart from school, it's up to them whether they take their phones. As long as they are wearing a watch and know what time they have to be home it all seems to work reasonably well.

I do know a couple of parents that seem to get very flustered if they can't get a gps fix on tier kids at any given moment though.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good on them and it stops them eating up votes which further strengthen Tory rule.

The number of votes is pretty tiny, and you have to consider how many former communist voters will vote Labour, rather than either not vote, or vote for one of the other parties on the fringes.  You also have to consider whether the communist party endorsing labour means some proportion of more centrist voters decide they'd rather vote Lib Dem, or Green etc.. because they don't like communism.. You are talking about 1200 or so votes across the UK in 2015, that's around the same as the Pirate Party had in the UK with fewer candidates (and about the same number of members..). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> diots like Bush, Obama, Clinton and Hollande would bring "democracy" (i.e. anarchy and theocracy) to many more countries if they had their way. 

Of that set, none of them have any power, so.. I'm not sure how it's relevant at this point (also, you missed Blair..). And you are right, they intervened in areas of the world where there was little holding things together and essentially created massive instability.  But they have done that, it's not going away any time soon.

Creating stability = supporting dictators. 

Or invading and occupying a country in a massive manner.. I mean, you have two options, a light touch or a very heavy approach.  Mostly it seems we take the former approach these days, the results don't seem to be great.

Maybe a good plan but lets start with not ousting dictators who keep countries relatively stable and prosperous.

Right, but again, a good plan would suggest something we can do in the future, what that doesn't do is deal with the existing issues.  I agree that we shouldn't go around destabilising any more countries if we can help it, but that doesn't solve the problems now, and it doesn't solve the issues of migration flows from countries where there hasn't been an intervention by the UK/US/France or others either.

I completely agree with refugee camps in the region. This is something that should have happened years ago.

It's something that did happen years ago, the issue is that the scale isn't right and obviously people want somewhere to go later too, offering at least a suggestion that there might be somewhere for them to go back to helps with that. I know quite a few people who had settled in the UK who went back to Libya after the fall of Gaddafi, because they wanted to help rebuild for example.

They often get more than they could ever hope to make in their countries of origin, particularly if you include stuff like top notch medical care. 

They often face vastly lower living standards and less potential too though. 
The draw isn't the money, it's safety and opportunity for their kids and families.  Money is secondary, painting it as though they are here for some quick cash is a little absurd.

They often get more than citizens on welfare, for example by being allowed to skip the queue for social housing, or a stipend for furniture.

That would depend on country, in the majority of cases they'd get less than a citizen on welfare, and they aren't allowed into the queue for social housing, and instead get emergency accommodation that wouldn't be suitable for a normal citizen under normal circumstances.  I'm sure there are edge cases, but again, it's not as though the majority of refugees or migrants end up better off than the equivalent out of work, or homeless national.

Allowing human trafficking is not part of my value system.

Presumably nor is allowing people to die needlessly, even if they took a risk in the first place, and especially if they are fleeing a war.  I didn't suggest that human trafficking was acceptable, it isn't, but rendering aid is both acceptable and generally seen as a positive value. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reducing the motivation for the migrants is easy:

You say that but:

1. Stop removing dictators like Gadhaffi, Assad.

A bit later for the former, and the latter may not be gone, but the conflict isn't going to stop. So you either need to put in place refugee camps that are both safe and comfortable enough in the region, or do more to create stability.

2. Stop offering them a life long cash handout in return for risking their lives on a boat.

I'm reasonably sure no EU countries offer significant, life long, cash handouts to valid asylum seekers or migrants.  Most offer accommodation and a very small amount of money (and actually offer more for return..) to those that qualify.

If anything, perpetuating the notion that if you get into Europe you will be handed cash for life, in the way you have done above, is at least part of the problem (although often it has been a variety of activist groups that suggest more support is available than is strictly true).

Reducing the motivation for the NGOs is easy as well: prison time.

I didn't suggest reducing the motivation for NGO's I suggested that preventing them from saving people at risk of dying isn't something that I'd see as an option if you believe in the values most European states generally seek to claim as their own. </TEXT>

To be fair, picking up people a few km from any coast is saving people from dying, unless they happen to have the capacity to return to that coast, which it seems a lot of the people smugglers intentionally remove once they get to a certain point.

I understand what you mean, in that there is a difference between essentially running a shuttle service, and in picking up people in distress, but in practice that's harder to separate, which is where removing, or reducing the motivation to make the attempt in the first place becomes important.. </TEXT>

What your point seems to suggest however is that someone on the minimum wage (and over 25..) working 38 hours a week would take home around 1,115 a month (after tax and NI) and so can't afford to spend 1200-1500pcm on a small flat in London... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, if you use wage growth as a single data point it's problematic, absolutely.. But we were talking about standards of living and human rights.. The UK has increased the point at which people start to pay tax for example, it has also introduced marriage equality, it has increased the minimum wage and significantly reduced unemployment since 2008 too... There are a whole slew of areas where the UK has gone backwards (look at what the current government has done to the provision of support for disabled people..) but also where the UK has moved forward.  What we aren't seeing is some sort of general, objective decline which is what the parent suggested.

Oh and there are clearer and better sources than the daily mail for the same data. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The former Prime Minister said it was important to vote for candidates who had an open mind on the final deal and that people should not limit their votes to just Labour because the issue was bigger than party allegiance.

See that makes sense for the referendum, you vote on the issue, rather than a party position, but when it comes to a General election, all those other issues that generally create party allegiance are more important than just the exit deal. Don't get me wrong, the terms under which we leave the EU are pretty important, but if you vote for a pro-remain Tory over a Labour candidate, you are going to have to consider the impact on education, health, jobs, social security and all the rest of it..  In this case, party allegiance, or rather policy is more important than just the way we leave the EU. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 8 seats.

National polling is often a bad indicator of Lib Dem electoral success because they tend to be good at targeted, local campaigning in specific seats. Most predictors use uniform swings, which rarely apply. For example, it is widely expected that the Lib Dems will be able to win back several of their traditional London seats which were lost to the Conservatives in 2015.

True, but they tend to have that depth in a few areas and it takes a lot (like the 2010 GE, and as much as I don't really like him, Nick helped a lot there..) to push the areas where they are just behind across the line. Lib Dem support is broad, but not deep, its the same problem UKIP had (although it looks like UKIP are about to run into bigger problems...).  I can absolutely see the Lib Dems increasing their vote share from the polling currently, but I doubt it'll translate into seats.. That might change as the campaign goes on of course. </TEXT>

Seriously? There are countries in the EU that have done better, there are countries in the EU that have done less well than the UK. The UK isn't on some downhill slide, it has a conservative government with a different set of priorities (not ones that I happen to agree with, but hey) and every single cut has been carried out within the framework of the EU, and a lot of the progress the UK has made on protections over the last few years has been done without direction from the EU..

The idea that the EU is the protector of living standards or human rights is frankly a bit absurd, we all fought for those and we have to fight to keep them.  Look at countries like Greece (just the most startling example, not the only one...) and tell me that the EU has been responsible for a rise in living standards or the maintenance of protections. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To a certain extent (like when it gives you the day off, or it's a national day etc..), but places like the UK, where religion is still arguably very visible, it has become a more cultural thing than a matter of faith.

You will find people attending certain church events, not because they are religious, but because it is tied into something else (whether that's a wedding, funeral, st Georges day service/parade, remembrance Sunday service etc.) and obviously there is all the legacy stuff, like Sundays in general being a non/reduced-work day for most (non-retail....) workers etc.. There  are also lots of local quirks, like maypoles and [well dressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_dressing) which have pagan or other roots and get appropriated by religion at some points, then become more civic etc..

Given the sheer amount of churches and intermingled 'things' that exist, and the lack of separation between church and state (in the UK at least..) it's to be expected really.

*"For those sitting around the table in Brussels, this is an irrelevance."*

But for those sitting in Westminster it isn't. If this election goes as it seems it might then May will have the domestic clout to push for whatever she wants to push for and not have to worry about dissenters in her own party. It means she can pass whatever legislation she needs for whatever Brexit she wants (well, to a certain degree..) not tempered by Labour or the Lib Dems.

That's not a good thing for non Conservative voting Brits, whether leave or remain, but it's certainly good for her and will strengthen her hand in the sense that she won't be looking over her shoulder when she tries to play it.

Labours collapse couldn't have come at a worse time.  About the only silver lining if things do go the way they seem to be, is that the EU exit will be an exit, and isn't likely to be some half arsed redux of membership under a different name. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We can't just drop our current work and suddenly start assessing brand new drugs. There is concern about how such a large shift, if it were to come from the MHRA, would take place.

No, of course not. And this is true in all the areas where competencies currently exercised by the EU will be exercised by the UK. But then that's also what the period we are going through now is supposed to deal with, that should mean (although... Tory government...) more funding and recruitment to meet the additional workload. 

Not to mention that this is all before we consider that there is no real reason why the EU and UK can't reach an agreement on equivalence (as the EU has and does do with other countries..).

The point, to some extent, of leaving the EU, was to push these competencies back under the control of the UK government, that's basically the point. Anyone who voted leave and is now concerned about the fact that the UK is going to have to exercise the competencies that have been exercised by the EU really needs to consider what 'leaving' something means, although as I said above, cooperation, coordination and bilateral agreements are also a thing.

With a bit of luck, you'll see more funding and more scope, but we'll see. 

And as a side note, IIRC looking through the MHRA budget a little while ago, the MHRA seems to be incredibly efficient and not a bad place to park some additional funding, possibly together with some close additional cooperation with GOScience to see what other benefits can be found..

*Edit - since I have you here... Any thoughts on the current EU approach to the balance of regulation on 'Novel food's' which seem to fall between medical and food standards competencies? Came up a while back and the approach (any member approval for things I'd have thought would be better regulated by a medicines agency than a food standards agency..) seemed somewhat inconsistent, leading to something akin to regulatory shopping and looked like it might poke a hole in some of the medicines regulation.  Not to mention the absurd approach by importers of unauthorised novel foods to sell things as for 'study/not for consumption/collectors' etc.. where they were clearly intended to be sold for consumption (and even then often as a medical treatment rather than a food or supplement..).*

*Anyway.. I digress.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could you have a functioning system where the party platforms/promises are scrutunized by an official non-partisan, panel that exposes to the public the feasibility and the pros and cons of implementation, vetoes promises that are unfeasible, and holds parties accountable for implementing the promises that are feasible once elected?The panel could allow parties to break promises only under certain circumstances, like if new scientific data becomes available or the situation changes significantly etc. but the parties wouldn't be allowed to change their minds without explaining themselves to the panel and facing whatever repercussions.

Arguably yes, you could design it into a system as an additional check on government power.  You'd still have several major non-trivial issues to overcome though, and it is a lot of power to grant to a panel (and the usual issues of capture by either politics or someone else..).   

The main problems are pretty obvious ones, starting with the mild issue that a lot of political issues don't have objectively 'correct' solutions, and often you have different schools of thought constantly offering different evidence or suggestions on how to solve them. Throw in the fact that you probably don't want politicians to be unable to change their entirely subjective views and it gets messy quite quickly. 

It also doesn't solve the issues of politicians often not having the power to unilaterally deliver on their promises.

Currently all of that seems to be left up to the media. For democracy to work we need informed, active voters, and accountable, capable leaders. What is the best way to get reliable information to voters? What is the best way to hold leaders accountable? If voters are not adequately informed and all the candidates are unreliable, how does voting stay relevant?

The 'correct' answer is that you need a responsible and independent media with broad freedom to report able to inform the electorate.  Having a reasonably educated (literate at the very least..) electorate is important too obviously, as is the ability for anyone to report and become part of the media.

When that stops working you have fairly major issues anyway. To take your example above, would you be happy with say, the current US government legislating to establish the panels that you describe? Even with a perfect set up, how do you think people, the media or anyone else react to the panels acting on a 'broken promise'?

You absolutely could do it, but it could become as much of an issue, if not more of one, than politicians not always delivering on their promises.

They were part of the government and they allowed the Conservatives to push through their policies in a lot of areas that were quite contemptible.  They are as responsible for that as they are for what they wanted to achieve.  

Now I understand why the Lib Dems did what they did, and it was their choice, but it wasn't the only choice they had.  What it does mean is that they are responsible for what happened whilst they were in government.

As to whether they'd do it again, I mostly agree with you that given they almost destroyed their own support last time around, they are unlikely to do it again.  To a certain extent it doesn't look like they will be in a position where they can again for a while at least either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd argue though that even if most data was public, that sort of information overload increases the need to have access to analysts and specialists that help you interpret that data. There is a big difference between having access to all of the data about an agency and being able to just sit down with the leader of the agency. They will likely have perspective and insights unique to their experience in working with the data or even forming the policies that you're trying to act on.

Agreed, and again, that is mitigated in some systems by having access to the civil service to some degree, public funding for your own staff and government analysis, although that'll be variable depending on what country you are talking about.

Either way, it's not as though candidates who are allowed those briefings are able to just walk around asking questions and snooping in files. They get the information that the representative from the intelligence leadership chose to share which is going to be a pretty narrow slice.

That's true, and the US is somewhat interesting because most of it's government departments are far more politicised than in other countries, so I can imagine there being shenanigans and posturing in a way that wouldn't be as likely in say Germany..

As I said, it's certainly a factor, but the amount that it matters will depend on candidate, country and issue to a large degree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very true, although quite a few countries mitigate that to a large degree (with access to classified material and government estimates whilst in opposition, subject to the same clearance processes that are applied to the elected officials of the government).  It's also fair to say that a huge amount of information, especially on spending, contracts and so on is public to a large degree now too.

If anything, I'd argue that it's less of an issue for someone looking to be president or the opposition parties in a parliamentary system, more of an issue for individual candidates at a lower level.  As I understand it, in the US, presidential candidates have access to classified briefings on matters of security and similar quite early on.

It'd certainly be a factor though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't think of one directly, presumably because in most democratic systems, winning an election doesn't give the candidate free reign to implement policy over and above the usual parliamentary (or similar) processes. It would put you in the kind of territory where you are holding someone accountable for something they can't deliver on without someone else acting too.

That said, there are things like the [The Salisbury Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Convention) in the UK that prevent the upper house from opposing government legislation promised in its election manifesto (although obviously the government still has to pass it through the lower house etc..).

In addition, some countries allow for [recall elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election) to hold elected politicians to account in office.

I think though the biggest issue you'd hit with anything that made candidates legally accountable for implementing their campaign promises is that you hand a lot of power over to whoever enforces them, potentially in a very problematic way.  The second would be interpretation of the promises and the impact on unforeseen variables and external influences..

Of course a lot of people would say that the next election is when candidates are held accountable for their campaign promises, and failure to deliver would, or at least could result in not getting re-elected..

It's an interesting area though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's for an example say that, I wanted to open a data center. Normally starting a data center while bootstrapping is impossible.

To be fair, if you are a start up without a lot of capital, you wouldn't generally be looking to set up a data centre, and right now you generally don't need to (you can buy server time and resell it more easily now than at any time, essentially anyone can set up a virtual data centre and scale it as required, you don't need to spend the massive amounts required to actually build one until it makes sense to do so.). 

Obviously that does depend somewhat on your idea, but you should be able to at least prove your idea at a smaller scale before you start investing in buildings and lots of depreciating equipment with high maintenance costs.

*Edit: The point was, look for cheap alternatives to get things up and running as best you can, you can sell something that mostly works far better than an idea with a large cost associated with it.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I'm not denying that you're right, just that sheer numbers isn't the best way of showing that.

My point would be that the absolute numbers are as useful as anything else in suggesting scale, they are clearer and easier to understand.

I'd agree that they don't tell the whole story (in relation to population size as you suggest) but there are other variables ignored either way. 

If it were a smaller increase, or if population growth were relevant, it might make sense. Given we are talking about the increase in the number of graduates of around 1700% for first degrees and 7300% for higher degrees (someone check my working....),  I don't think anyone would assume that population growth would account for the difference (30% increase over the period..).

That said, it's always nice to see data presented in different ways to make it easier to get your head around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> much more solid statistic and sheer number's will include bias such as population growth, the fact we had just come out of a massive war etcetc

Sort of.. It does the job in indicating the difference in access either way, you could do it by head of population, but you'd be ignoring several aspects (foreign students and demographics - there are far more 'older' people now etc..) and in any case, looking at annual award rates doesn't fully show the skew in the proportion of degree qualified people in the population at any given point (i.e, it's massively higher than even the numbers below would suggest after 1992 because of the cumulative effect..).

Although if you are interested, after some rough calculations, It was 3.5 per 10k of population in 1950, compared to 65 per 10k of population in 2016 for a first degree and 0.5 per 10k in 1950 vs 37 per 10k in 2016 for higher degrees. In each case being awarded a degree, not the total numbers with a degree of course. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, by the same reasoning, if it's so easy to get a degree now and almost anyone can do so, does that mean those that choose not to are, by definition, uneducated?

Broadly yes, although it's sort of depends what they did instead of getting a degree and at what point you'd accept someone was educated (does getting 10 GCSE's at A-C leave you educated or uneducated?). If you go and do a multi-year apprenticeship (that'll often lead to qualifications) you'd not be uneducated, arguably if you went to university and didn't get your degree you'd still be educated, but not qualified (and potentially not intelligent..).

'Uneducated' and 'intelligent' are not equivalent terms, of course.

Indeed, and I think that's the issue with the stat on degrees, you have vastly more being issued now than before, that isn't because the current generation are vastly more intelligent, but because there is more emphasis and more access to higher education.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You mean, if you were to have a General Election with two of the major parties being absolutely identical and having as a sole difference one wantign to leave and one to remain.

Essentially. 

But that is not the case, is it? Both major parties wanted to remain, so the whole point being made, as I see it, is completely irrelevant.

It is irrelevant. That said, some people are suggesting that a party fighting the election on the basis that the UK wouldn't leave the EU might be able to pull in a significant proportion of those that voted remain in the referendum, and so would do very well. The reality is that they likely wouldn't do well enough to get a majority (and realistically would likely do a lot worse, because they aren't going to get close to having all the remain voters voting for them..).

Both major parties wanted to remain, so the whole point being made, as I see it, is completely irrelevant.

Indeed, although neither Labour nor the Conservatives will be running on that basis and even the Lib Dems seem to have pivoted again to a 'softer brexit' stance, rather than a remain stance.

In short though, it comes down to the fact that you can't really use the referendum as a guide to the Election, and that the issues are far more complex than remaining or leaving the EU (and I'd assume that the EU will, as it usually is, be far less important to most people than a slew of other issues..).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still don't see why the referendum should have been run on constituencies rather than the number of votes, since in the end the vote was for, as you say, yes or no and not to put in place people in seats.

No one is saying it should have been, all that is being said is that in the context of remain and leave voters, if they voted purely on leave and remain issues in a GE, the leave 'party' would win by a much larger proportion of seats than is apparent from the percentage of the vote.  

The point being that even if all the 'remain' voters stuck together and voted to veto leaving the EU, leave voters doing the same would get a much, much larger share of the seats. Or to put it another way, using the referendum as a guide to suggest the two sides are close in electoral terms is false, and the chances of this election 'overturning' the referendum are essentially nil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a generally fair assessment to day those with university degrees are more intelligent than those with no more than O levels.

On an individual basis, with all else being equal it might be, but then older people had less access to university than people do now, I'd be willing to bet that plays a fairly large part too.  In 1950, 17,300 people received first degrees and 2,400 were awarded higher degrees, in 2016 it was closer to 400,000 first degrees and 240,000 higher degrees.

Do you think that's because people are smarter, or because almost anyone can get access to higher education if they want it and put in some effort now? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter in the context of the referendum, it matters in the context of a General Election.  If you had a party that got 52% of the vote, by getting a small majority in 70% of the constituencies contested, vs a part that got 48% of the vote, by getting (presumably much larger majorities) in 30% of the constituencies contested, then that 52% would equate to 70% of the seats, and the 48% would get the other party 30% of the seats.

To put it another way, the referendum was close, because it was a straight yes no vote, with the majority winning, the General Election will be run on a constituency by constituency basis. If the referendum were run in that way (and of course it wouldn't be..), the result wouldn't have been close at all.

	<TEXT> That's fortunate. Running that kind of facility is very expensive.

The key seems to be partnerships with industry, so it's a case of being able to move through GCSE (and having kit and projects funded at least in part, as well as access to employers for expertise in teaching..).  That seems to be followed by have a route through to the businesses themselves in terms of either apprenticeships, training or a continued link through university.

It seems pretty well put together although it'll be interesting to see if it catches on more broadly, and we see more kids taking it on..

When I've had to use skilled trades in electronics R D (e.g. hand assembly, cabinet wiring) the people we've brought in have all been really close to retirement without any plans to train anyone to replace them. I hope that things have changed over the last 5 years or so.

I wonder how much of that is a demand for experience that you aren't going to get from new entrants, or availability you won't get from people who are working full time in the industry already.  

Don't get me wrong though, there are almost certainly skills gaps, but I don't think it's as acute as some people are suggesting, especially given that some of the skills gaps employers are talking about are at times in areas where you can bring someone (with the right aptitude..) up to speed in 3-6 months with training.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm genuinely not convinced that this assertion is true. Our ability to train skilled manual/technical workers has taken a massive hit over the last 20 years with the shift towards the service industry. There are still people who have the skill, experience and facilities to train machinists (for example), but there are few of them around; many have now retired. When was the last time you visited a secondary school with both a proper machine shop capable of teaching sessions for 30+ students and the technicians   support staff required to help them learn safely?

Just looking at Sheffield, there seems to be a push to get people back into technical trades (UTC Sheffield taking people from 14 onward as an alternative to the normal GCSE routes), that's with employer sponsorship and so on. Apprenticeships (apart from the genuinely crappy retail ones..) are also far more available for everything from bricklaying and construction through to machinists and engineering.

	<TEXT> You'd expect this to be true to some extent, but the bottom line is that allegiance to party mandates that your MP votes with them on certain issues.

Yes.. And at times that happens, and at other times it doesn't. Your MP will also have input into the party position though and they will generally be able to do a better job of representing you, than your party leader would. 

To put it another way, lets say you are anti-Nuclear (power, weapons, waste whatever..), and that is a major red line for you in terms of voting.  Do you vote for an MP that is pro-nuclear because their leader is anti, or do you vote for an MP that is anti-nuclear even though their leader is pro? Your MP might be running campaigns in support of your position against the general policy position of their party (happens a lot in contentious areas.) surely that's more valuable than a soundbite in a TV debate.

ultimate control remains with the party leaders.

Some control remains with the leaders, diluted by cabinet and subject to the support of MPs more generally.  Putting a spotlight on the leaders is then unhelpful for anything other than making the UK system seem far more presidential than it is and creating more antipathy toward politicians as people realise that the person they voted for, isn't the person they saw on TV.. </TEXT>

Very few countries are self sufficient, the UK isn't self sufficient in a whole slew of areas and it supplies things others can't make too.  Surely it's better to be a customer in a large market for a simple good (like steel, where you have lots of producers) whilst making complex goods where there aren't a lot of alternate suppliers.. 

At the end of the day, if China decides it doesn't want to sell us Steel, we can buy from Japan, India, the US, Germany or elsewhere.   It it looks like it's going to get really serious, we'd have to invest in our own infrastructure, we currently produce about the same as Poland (albeit more efficiently and in a more environmentally friendly manner..). The alternative is essentially to subsidise steel production in the UK that has to compete with even cheaper production from elsewhere, surely there are better things we can spend that money on? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sort of. We're the 9th largest in the world but we've been dropping continuously for the last 50 years. Our manufacturing sectors output in comparison to other sectors has been dropping as well. It accounts for less than 11% of our national output.

Indeed, but that's still a lot of manufacturing, especially given we are very specifically not a manufacturing economy.  And yes, manufacturing has dropped in terms of it's share of our economy, but that shouldn't be surprising given that as with agriculture, you need far fewer people to make lots of goods, and so have a lot of skilled manpower working in the service economy (one that does very well in fact..).  

A lot of companies in these industries are complaining about a lack of skilled people to hire.

They are although that is changing, with employers starting to take roles (directly, or in sponsorship terms) to bring people through the education system with the relevant skills.  Obviously employers would vastly prefer for there to be an overabundance of skilled people, but they do have the option of training people too (and are starting to do so) and of course the shortages aren't staggering either, we aren't seeing a lack of investment because we don't have skilled people available. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I imagine parents with more than three kids, especially parents from the days not long ago when families raised tens of children due to the lack of available birth control and the need for free labor, are like, Three? Big damn deal And theres some truth to that. I look back at our brief days with only Nile and have trouble understanding why I was ever stressed..

We had twins as our 'third'.  Strangely it didn't feel like a massive increase in stress or effort (you sort of have everything sorted out after the second, efficiency is the key word and so on..). It does however become noticeable when one or more of the kids spend a day or more at the grandparents.. Suddenly there is silence and you can sit down and do things like read for an hour, or watch TV..  

That said, I'd still argue that the first is the game changer, everything after that is essentially asking for an extension..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the contrary, the debates offer an opportunity for voters to actually get a taste of what each candidate stands for.

But we aren't voting for May, or Corbyn, or Farron etc.. we are voting for MPs at the constituency level.  I mean, take Corbyn as an example, how well was he represented in the TV debates when Gordon Brown was leader?

It doesn't really give voters a chance to get a taste of anything, all it does is continue to push the kind of presidential approach that started with Blair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which is great, but you'll be voting for your local MP, not them.  If Corbyn or May debate something, the result doesn't mean that your local Labour or Tory candidate will support that position if it comes to a vote, or support it generally within Parliament.  

It distorts the elections more than it helps and turns the election of 650 MPs, with a whole slew of candidates in each constituency into a popularity contest between a few leaders representing a minority of the people standing...

If we are going to do something like that, then at the very least we need televised local hustings too (and I'd happily have televised local hustings instead).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a Tory and to be honest,  I'm not that keen on the TV debates, I'd happily see constituency hustings televised (we have local and city TV after all..), but the national TV debates take away from the fact that we don't actually get to vote on who is PM, and push the party over candidate aspect  excessively and further lock out independents and smaller/regional parties... </TEXT>
