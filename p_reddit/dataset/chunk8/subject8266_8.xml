	<TEXT> Just finished up [**Ties by Domenico Starnone tras. by Jhumpa Lahiri**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31243077-ties), book. Pretty good book about a husband and wife, infidelity, their adult children, and a break in.  
  
Will start [**The Handmaid's Tale**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/688954.The_Handmaid_s_Tale) next in anticipation of the series.  
  
Finishing up [**A Separation by Katie Kitamura**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30407998-a-separation), audiobook. Pretty meh for this book, a little underwhelmed considering the hype. Can't wait to move on, frankly. It's oddly reminiscent of the Third Reich by Roberto Bolano, only not remotely as good. </TEXT>

You may wanna try award winners...[Nobel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Literature)  
[The Man Booker International Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Booker_International_Prize), used to be awarded for bodies of work like the Nobel, but now it's for individual titles in translation. They release a longlist every year of 13 books which is a pretty solid list. [2016](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/97621.Man_Booker_International_Prize_Longlist_2016), [2017](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/109710.The_Man_Booker_International_Prize_2017_Longlist).

	<TEXT> Christ. Outer Dark by Cormac McCarthy:  
  
["Harmon was watching the man. Even the mute one stirred. The man took hold of the child and lifted it up. It was watching the fire. Holme saw the blade wink in the light like a long cats eye slant and malevolent and a dark smile erupted on the childs throat and went all broken down the front of it. The child made no sound. It hung there with its one eye glazing over like a wet stone and the black blood pumping down its naked belly. The mute one knelt forward. He was drooling and making little whimpering noises in his throat. He knelt with his hands outstretched and his nostrils rimpled delicately. The man handed him the child and he seized it up, looked once at Holme with witless eyes, and buried his moaning face in its throat."](/spoiler) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Not to sound pedantic but I'm of the opinion not very many books of any genre will still be written 

You don't sound pedantic, but you do sound wrong. Wasn't there a post just yesterday about reading statistics, and over 70% of people had read a book in the previous year. Not good, but not too shabby either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to traditional kids' fair (Thomas, Shel Silverstein), my kids are really fond of a few books, in particular [**The Lion and the Bird**](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/07/the-lion-and-the-bird-marianne-dubuc/). We don't read it too much because I literally choke up every time.  
  
Then there's the books by Emily Winfield Martin, like [**Dream Animals**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17061551-dream-animals), or [**The Wonderful Things You Will Be**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23742842-the-wonderful-things-you-will-be), just great whimsical illustrations and fun poems or stories.

	<TEXT> Yeah, that's what makes it all just a gross cash grab. Like I appreciate diversity, but don't just pull a character and add a Latino altern. You're just trying to force the "diversity dollars" to come in in addition to the regular readers. It's not like they can't afford to splash cash a new writers/artists with diverse ideas. Produce 20 new books and I bet some will stick. </TEXT>
