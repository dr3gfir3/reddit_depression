I'm not denying that cops have dangerous job, they do, especially in some areas. However it is not nearly as bad as they would want us to believe, and by doing so and manipulating narrative and public they literarily get away with murder! </TEXT>

In my case cheaper/smaller/lighter is better (up to $80 I guess). I basically just need head.

Tripod with main camera would go on top of it. 

This way I would have second camera on hand and ready to go at any time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I know ( some of it from personal experience ) US does not "carpet bomb" in order to keep civilian casualties to minimum. 

During NATO bombing of Serbia they were surgically hitting targets such as particular floor in high-rise that housed TV station or some military department within building located in the center of Belgrade. 

We used to visit sites that were bombed the night before ( school was closed so we had nothing better to do and it was truly impressive how precise and destructive they are in small radius. 

With that said they also had a lot of collateral damage ( usually caused by human error ) where they unload fighter jets over little town full of civilians or targeting train filled with thousands of refugees. 

This particular bomb is "carpet bombing" type of weapon in my opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stop spinning your own words, your original statement was clearly false, and to be perfectly honest it is insulting to anyone that had family that died actually fighting Third Reich in WWII. 

After WWII entire world was in ruins morally and financially, many populations/groups were prosecuted, purged and suffered before during and after WWII, and that will continue until the end of time. 

Sorry to disappoint you but Jews do not have monopoly on suffering and prosecution. Just ask Gypsies, Palestinians, Tibetans, Armenians, Albanians ... I'm not going to even mention tens of millions of people all over Africa, Central and South America that still to this day are facing prosecution and genocide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> O I know, and that is why Russia has Jewish Autonomous Oblast that was established in 1930s ( golden age of communist regime in Russia ) and still exists today and beside Israel it is the only Jewish territory in the world! 

Also correct me if I'm wrong but for decades after WWII and during communist regime only people that were allowed to move out of Russia were in fact Jews. By doing so Russians essentially helped create Israel because largest Jewish population in history in fact lived on Russian territory.

Truth is there were only short periods of time when Jews faced procession in Russia and that was for the most part done by Tzar Alexander III and not Red Army. As the matter of fact Red Army prosecuted and executed people involved in purges once they took control of territories where Jews were being executed. 

Truth is that you are trying to play victims card and than when you get called out you start to backpedal and talk about stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with topic at hand. 

Finally you failed to explain why did you insult every single Polack on planet earth by saying that they were in fact Nazi supporters and that they helped transport and purge Jews in WWII when in real life they were the nation that sufferer just as much as Jews.  </TEXT>

What the fuck are you talking about? 

Russia is the single most deserving nation in fight against Third Reich Regime. If it wasn't for their determination and sacrifice outcome of the war could have been much different especially for Jews!  

Point is that Jews them selfs identify as Jews and not as Americans or Russians or Dutch or Germans. It really does not matter if country was friendly to them or not during the WWII. No other group/population in the world states their religion before their nationality.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You do understand that Jews were not only people that were sent to concentration camps in WWII. 

For example one of the largest concentration camps in Europe was Jasenovac in Croatia and was operated by Ustae ( Croatian Nationalistic Army that was fighting on the side on Nazis ) majority of people in concentration camps operated by Ustae were in fact Serbs, Gypsies, Bosnians, Albanians, etc ... 

There is no denying that for the most part Jews were main target of Nazis, but to say that they were only people that suffered in concentration camps is historically inaccurate and even offensive for those of us who had ancestors that shared the same fate as Jews.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, to be fair he does have a point that Hitler didn't use chemical weapons on his own people ... Who cares about use of chemical weapons on people of virtually all other nations in Europe.

That is considered FairPlay, right? 

Edit: I have made the mistake and you people are right, there was many Jews that in fact had German citizenship, so in turn they are Germans. Now with that said, I live in area that is heavily populated by Jews, and I have yet to hear a single one of them say ( publicly or privately ) that they are _______ of Jewish descent. It is always I'm Jewish, but my family is originally form Germany, Hungary, Austria, Yugoslavia, Russia, etc ... Not a single one identifies with nationality of origin only with religion!

Point that I'm trying to make is that you can't really claim nationality only when it is convenient for you. That is not a right way of doing things. 

Now you can continue with down votes ...

* Manager that talked to passenger prior to forceful removal stated that he was picked because his ticket was cheapest 

* They have offered $800 voucher ( not cash ) there were people willing to get off the flight but they asked for $1600 manager refused to do so.

Now you on the other hand are saying that law and user agreement it is just fine and that airlines should be able to treat passengers any way they please. Yet somehow you failed to rationally explain why do you think that other than it is a law on the books, deal with it. 

Point is that no one on earth would want to be treated in this way. There is million different things that United could and should have done to defuse the situation and make it work for everyone yet they choose to do one thing that is not helping anyone involved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is mainly self interest, but most of them can't just "switch sides" because they are already neck deep in to all kinds of criminal activities so they have to stay loyal no matter what. 

For example in late 90's ( when I lived in Serbia ) it was not uncommon for police lieutenant for example to take out an ad in news papers in order to publicly express his condolences to grieving family of well known criminal that was murdered by someone for whatever reason. 

For the record we are talking about Miloevi regime, now what you also need to understand is that current president and premier Aleksandar Vui and people closest to him were all part of that same regime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wrong! 

Police Union actually put out the statement 3 days ago fully supporting students/protestors. 

Here is google translation of article talking about it, along with the link to original article and official statement it self.


Police union supported the "Protest against the dictatorship," a press release in which it stated that it does not put anybody's side and calling on all political parties to let children and students to peacefully express their dissatisfaction. "Dear, do not think about your own interests, and your families, think of all citizens, their families, children and generations yet to come", said among other things in a statement published on the Facebook page Union of Police. This communication is addressed to "Let's listen to children."
They call on all parties to let young people express their discontent through peaceful means and also called on police officers to apply the legal authority.
Distinguished from the ruling party and the opposition sit together and resolve this issue in a separate room if need be, kill one another, but do not allow loss of life of children, the citizen or the police officer, because you did something wrong - conclusion statements.
Representative Police union of Serbia and Military Union of Serbia announced today that due to the bad situation and standards of employees on April 8 protest outside the Serbian government building in Belgrade.
In a statement signed by the President of the Police Union Veljko Mijailovic has stated that it is a difficult situation in the Serbian Interior Ministry and the Serbian Army made him the fourth time take to the streets and demand their rights.

	<TEXT> You definitely need at least one flash and wide lens especially if you are plaining on doing formal group shots. 

As stated before ideally you should get 24-70mm because it is more or less do it all for this type of work. I personally don't like to swap lenses all night long especially if I'm working with mirrorless camera. 

As far as tips for beginner, biggest time saver during formal group shots is that everyone who should be in pictures is available at the same time. Meaning ask someone to wrangle all close family and friends place couple where you want them and than just add and subtract people as needed. 

During party/dancing portion try not to isolate people to much when framing shots, because people like to see stuff happening around them. Also try to take photojournalistic approach and don't make your self center of attention.
