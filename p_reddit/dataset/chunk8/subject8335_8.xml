	<TEXT> Not having any celebrity friends or supporters actually plays into Trump's extremely delusion-fuelled image as the friend of the everyman (he's just like us!). Having celebrity friends dying to play your party isn't really the best barometer for value or worth, and it's, well, trump-y to call people losers for things like that. That said, this was a great read.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may not be a "reference" exactly the way you mean it, but characters refer to Yale as "Yale" sooooo much I'm pretty sure it was a product placement kind of arrangement with a quota per episode. Every episode from 4.01 onwards, it is referenced by name conspicuously often, when any normal human being would say "university" or "college" or "school" (e.g., "I have to go back to Yale"; "How's Yale?"  of other examples that may SEEM like nothing, but if you pay attention it is really grating and I'm 95% sure it's straight up product placement).

Also, watching S4 and S5 Ernest Hemingway is referenced multiple times, with replies to the reference mentioning his suicide.

	<TEXT> LSD is one of those things that can be monumentally beneficial and amazing an experience or an emotional disaster, depending on many different factors. People who are generally mentally and emotionally stable, who have not undergone a recent trauma seldom have "bad trips." Set and setting is also important: you need to be in a safe place with people you like and trust, and ideally getting the lsd from a trusted source so you know how much you're taking. If you can manage all these things, it can be a beautiful or even massively spiritual experience.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From another angle, I would say Rory's identity and personality as a 32-year-old is a plausibly natural extension of her OS self. Rory has always been highly, sometimes disastously, impulsive, from small things like running off the NY to see Jess to sleeping with Dean to stealing the yacht; professionally she's also flip-flopped massively, turning down the job at the Providence paper while hoping for the NYT internship, abandoning her journalistic dreams after the talk with Mitchum, finally taking the online magazine job not because it's what she truly wanted but because it was her only viable option, however interesting. 

Rory's impulsivity as rooted in her emotional desires, logic and long-term ramifications notwithstanding, has always been pre-eminent, as has her misplaced professional potential. That she becomes a serial cheater who has intermittent, ambivalent success as a journalist is in some ways a perfectly natural extension of her character development in the OS. (As a small sidenote, her lack of a stable home situation in AYITL - NY, London, Stars Hollow - also speaks to her inability to stay rooted in one place even as an 18-21 year old, flitting regularly between Stars Hollow, New Haven, and her grandparents' house, too.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, meditation did not make your life worse! What can happen (*does* happen) when many start meditating is that they start to see and perceive certain aspects of their lives more clearly which in the short term can seem like a negative effect. So you mention how you "started seeing the world as a little uglier" - that can be manifested as a side effect of becoming more *aware* of certain realities that you may have ignored or seen through differently coloured lenses. The more you practise properly, the more equanimous you will become; this is kind of like a beginning stage it sounds like you are in, even if you began practising last year. Meditation practise can also cast light on certain negative patterns, or ideas of your "self" as well, but this negativity should be temporary.

When we start to really experience the effects of meditation, the ego often begins to feel very threatened, the mind can rebel, and this manifests in LOTS of different ways for different people. For many, the mind starts to perceive meditation as cumbersome, or as a "chore" as you put it - something that no longer fits in your schedule. I would suggest this is all the mind, and your ego struggling to maintain its hold in your life.

I always recommend for people to do a 10-day vipassana course as a way to really solidify a good practise (even if the technique is something you may not use as your main practise). It was of great benefit to me and countless others. If you go [here](https://www.dhamma.org) you will find course listings for wherever you are in the world.

Good luck and I hope you can keep practising :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is truly no wonder Rory has such relationship issues. 

First, she had no consistent father figure in her life. 

Second, her mother was, growing up, the epitome of how to fail at romantic relationships:

* Rory watched her mother abstain romantically for 16 years, then get involved in a string of star-crossed relationships. 

* Max was a trainwreck whom her mother abandoned hours(?) before their wedding day, effectively destroying the step-relationship to which both Max and Rory had been looking forward, and which would have done Rory a world of good.

* Jason's and Lorelai's relationship was mired in deception and then dissolved because of what may or may not have been a serious betrayal to the family.  Another form of betrayal/abandonment, however small.

* Lorelai and Chris have this will-they-or-won't-they thing forever, stringing Rory along in the process for years. Their marriage is a sham and dissolves within seconds. 

* Luke and Lorelai seem oddly fitting for each other, but have *absurd* communication and trust issues all around.


Then there's Rory herself. Her first truly passionate love abandons her, without a word of good-bye no less, and much more directly than the other men in her life. 

In the OS, she seems to be a firm disbeliever in cheating. She is horrified when Paris cheats on Jamie (not just because Asher is 42 years Paris's senior, I'm sure); is harshly critical of Lorelai sleeping with Christopher so soon after her break from Luke in S5or6, and is heartbroken when Logan jumps into bed with multiple bridesmaids even though they were on a break. 

With no resolution with her patterns of abandonment and issues of trust and stability in her life, it is unfortunate but also makes a sad sense that she becomes what she has been so disapproving of in the past. 

Romantically, she is like a lost girl, unsure of how to treat people properly. Also of note, besides Lane and Paris, she has sustained no close friendships either, nor a successful romantic relationship. I hope she can turn it around in this fictional universe. I really do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree with u/carbler above. People who have rewatched the series 8 times through and still let it occupy a massive part of their consciousness poo-pooing the idea of this book being a resonant, possibly raging success - or at least cult hit - is truly weird to me. Accepting the narrative of the show, Rory is a wildly talented writer, insightful and current. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET PUBLISHED IN THE NEW YORKER AND AS A YOUNG ONLY SLIGHTLY-EXPERIENCED WRITER? I mean, that's Zadie-Smith-level-skill. Hell, JD Salinger was rejected for like 10 years for his Holden Caulfield stuff. ESPECIALLY given that the NYer almost never publishes unknowns unless they hold unbelievable promise and knock the editors socks off. She's got skill, even if she has a poor work ethic with pieces she doesn't care about (i.e., falling asleep during Lines research) and freezes when she's on the spot (Sandee Says). 

She is at the LEAST a very good writer. She is maybe a great writer. Now imagine Chapter X, entitled "They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?" I would read the shit out of that story. And "You Jump, I Jump, Jack" (and other adventures in the Life and Death Brigade)? "A House is Not a Home"? This is a book most of us have already read and loved, for some of us many, MANY times over. And a talented enough writer can bring this, in a way, MORE engagingly to-life than a tv script-writer, director, or producer. Gilmore Girls is an amazing book. Y'all trippin'. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very "traditional" perspective weighing in: I would say a true yogi is by definition spiritual, as yoga classically means "union", specifically union with the Absolute. Yoga has traditionally been perceived as both the journey toward this union and the union itself. Happiness is a by-product of the union and the mindfulness that comes with the practise. In this sense a true yogi, if not happy, will be moving toward real happiness, maybe slowly, maybe in a two-steps-forward-one-step-back kind of pattern, but on a generally upward slope nonetheless and so, to give a percentage in answer to your question, I guess would then be 100%. I wouldn't call someone a "yogi" just because they attend a couple of classes a week. It's a state of mind and perspective, and the practise of asana is only one aspect (or limb).

I am a practising yogi. I would say my biggest obstacle right now is that I'm not really living in a spiritual environment, and am not part of an in-person spiritual community because of my geographic location. This will change next year, but for the time being it's difficult. But in general, I am happy, and am very spiritual. </TEXT>

As a side note, when I practise yin, I almost always practise vipassana at the same time, actually. It's not as deep a meditation, for obvious reasons, but I've found it EXTREMELY effective in practising anicca. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Normally, I would say yes, absolutely, sign up today, but this statement gives me a bit of pause:
I am not able to sit idle for even 10 mins

I would suggest practicing some basic mindfulness meditation each day until you can sit for 20 minutes at minimum without discomfort. I've done multiple 10-days and it is **intense**, and it would be best to have at least *some* experience sitting, especially if, after 5 minutes, you feel like you're going crazy. That would not really be the best frame of mind with which to enter the course. Again, it's not so much the never-meditated aspect, but the literally-unable-to-sit-still aspect I would recommend you work on a little first. Mindfulness is a great way to deal with that so you will be better prepared. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I respect it and feel sorry for it simultaneously. 

On the one hand, West New York knows what it is. It ain't got time for fancy name-making. On the other hand, people from West New York have to explain constantly that they are, no, not from the west part of either NYC or New York state, but West New York *New Jersey*. 

Always in the shadow, always overcrowded. And always real. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Supposedly humans tend to be on a 25-hour circadian rhythm cycle, so sometimes people who aren't working or have a lot of time-specific obligations will "naturally" find themselves staying up later and later until they are in a nocturnal state. This may or may not have anything to do with your meditation practise. 

When morning arises....I kind of go into a panic from all the over-stimulation, especially if needing to go out for groceries and have to drive/be around people (sensory overload)

This doesn't sound particularly healthy. Driving/being around people, unless you're in, say, Manila or some major city in India, should probably not be a "sensory overload."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you been to a counselor? Speaking to a professional about your anxiety and fears may help you unpack a lot of the issues that have led to you being in this state of mind. Plus an unbiased, professional perspective would serve you well for sorting out what your life or short term goals are, and how to work towards those.

Your life can "change" at any point. You need to put the work in though. The fact that you're meditating is a great start, even if it feels like it's not having tangible positive effects on you. I'd recommend setting up a regular practise time, maybe 1 hr per day, say 30 minutes in the AM and 30 minutes in the evening. If you're awake another 15 hours, then you can't be using it too much as an escapism, can you? - that seems more likely if you meditate whenever you feel like it. But if you're on a reasonable schedule, then you don't REALLY run that risk. Maybe you'll look forward to your sitting times more than you should, but we've all been there too, I bet.

Anyway, back to the anxiety/other issues. When I was 25, I dropped out of my teaching internship because of extreme anxiety. It had gotten so bad I had what is colloquially referred to as a "breakdown" after days of not sleeping and eventually feeling so anxious I could hardly move or converse. I couldn't even find the root of it, not for a while. But I saw a counselor, got a prescription for anti-anxiety medication, took up yoga, started volunteering, and got out of my own "head" for a while. My whole life turned around that year, but I needed to have that unspeakably low point to really instigate change in my life.

Your life can TRULY be whatever you want it to be. Good luck. And keep sitting :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  the best international schools where I live in Beijing are quite frankly vastly inferior to most schools in the UK

really? I'm a teacher in an international school, and have visited multiple international schools throughout China (albeit none in BJ), which seem to range from being *OK* to quite well-run with strong (international) curricula and good teachers. Some friends of mine who have taught in the UK have had some pretty terrible experiences with overcrowding, extremely unfortunate school culture, and complete lack of respect and discipline from kids, while others taught at extremely well-infrastructured schools.

Sorry, that was a ramble - I guess I'm just saying there seems to be a wide range here, as there is in most countries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you're calm, you should tell your friend the effect her statements/actions/whatever is having on you. Try to avoid blaming her directly -- we all think things like *this person made me angry* or *this person puts me in a bad mood* but it's much more helpful and mature to take responsibility for our own reactions and moods. 

You haven't really explained what she does or says exactly that has this effect on you, so it's hard to comment specifically, but being open and honest about your feelings is a good start. If she genuinely tries to antagonise you or anger you, or doesn't care about your feelings, you may want to look at stepping away from that "friendship." 

Personally, I always take a step back when I feel myself getting angry. I go somewhere and meditate, or if I can't, I just try to focus on my breath, and the feelings in my body without attachment. You have to make a conscious effort to not feed your anger, whilst still accepting it if that's how you're feeling in the moment.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The word "defect" carries connotations with it that speak to an "imperfection" or deficiency, as humans are not products like cars or appliances that measure to an ideal standard. Just as if someone were visually impaired, or deaf, we wouldn't say these people have "defects"; they have "disabilities." Congenital disabilities are now being seen in the same way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This, obviously, would not apply to arhats or bodhisattvas, because there would be no distress in the mind. From a Buddhist perspective, this is not technically suicide, because there was no being that was killed.

What of the suffering that may be caused to others by their act of killing themselves? Wouldn't that have some effect on their karma and subsequent rebirth?

	<TEXT> The criminal acts involved must be "motivated by bias, prejudice, or hate" under the new legislation. That by definition means not-an-accident.

	<TEXT> That's definitely not what the legislation allows for. You should read the bill. From the summary of the amendment in question, emphasis mine: 

The enactment also amends the Criminal Code to extend the **protection against hate propaganda** set out in that Act to any section of the public that is distinguished by gender identity or expression and to clearly set out that evidence **that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on gender identity or expression** constitutes an aggravating circumstance that a court must take into consideration when it imposes a sentence.

This is in no way represented by a case of someone "accidentally" calling someone she instead of he. No judge in our country could do that under the code. This references hate crimes and ongoing, perpetuated discrimination, not an honest mistake. </TEXT>
