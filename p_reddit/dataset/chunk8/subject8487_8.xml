	<TEXT> While you haven't completely change my mind I do agree that people who are better at their job deserve to be paid more to do it.   I wish there was an alternative system that was not based solely on a percentage of the bill.

	<TEXT> So, this doesn't completely change my mind, but I agree that people who are better at what they do deserve to be paid more to do it.  I still feel like purely basing tips on a percentage of the bill is not the best way to determine things, but also don't see much of an alternative.

	<TEXT> But then at many restaurant now days it's not even your server bringing you your food; it's an expediter or another server.   So you're saying I'm really tipping everyone in the back basically every time I go out? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I can see it both ways, I agree that a higher quality restaurant has additional value, I guess I don't like the idea that the price of the  food in particular is what constitutes how much I tip.  If I get great service at a chilis I feel the tip should be higher than at a steakhouse where the service isn't great. 
The service SHOULD be better but if it's not I don't like that the baseline for how much gratuity I owe jumps an energy level if the service isn't good.  

Maybe I'm not making sense.   I want to reiterate this isn't because I want to pay less in tips, I just don't feel like it should necessarily be based on food prices.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> CMV- Our tipping system is screwed up and should be changed to reflect the amount of time a server has our table, and not a percentage of the bill. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Why is it that a server who brings me a hamburger, fries and a few soft drink refills on a tab of say, $12, get a tip for $2.40-3, but a server who brings me a filet mignon and a bottle of wine with a tab of $60 gets a tip of $12?  

Besides, perhaps, having to dress up nicer, the server themselves has exactly the same job description when it comes to what I'm receiving from them.   

Why don't we pay for something akin to an hourly wage? So, I think a servers time is worth a range of $12-15 dollars and hour and I pay that based on how long I'm at her station.    I had great service on a bill of $30, I was there for 45 minutes, I tip $11.25. 

Note, I'm not advocating a system where we tip less necessarily, but just that it not be based off WHAT they bring me, but how long I'm one of their tables.  

Maybe $12-15 is high because they would generally have multiple tables?  I'm not sure, I just feel the current system isn't fair to servers who do great jobs but work at a sandwich shop instead of a steakhouse.   </TEXT>
