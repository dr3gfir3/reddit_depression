	<TEXT> You guys have all seen them, usually American vehicles lifted to fit 30 inch wheels under the fenders, usually with a shiny paint job to match. 

My question is how do they lift these cars? Mainly how do they lift the newer cars that aren't body-on-frame like your typical [Box Chevy](http://imgur.com/a/UPpBR)? 

I've done tons of searching and cannot come up with anything like a "kit" that would allow for a 4-6" lift on a [Mustang](http://imgur.com/a/I7yDS) or a [Camaro](http://imgur.com/a/ItDd7) or a [Charger](http://imgur.com/a/4E22H) for some examples. 

Does anyone know? Anyone have any experience building one of these?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh wow, I wish mine had the 5.4 sometimes. Although spark plugs were easier with the 4.6! Mine's at 190k, picked it up last August and have slowly built it to be what it is today. They'll take some abuse! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For a dedicated track car, you'll find virtually no difference between a 2005 and a 2009 GT. Going to a 2010-2011 will essentially add 60-70% to your purchase price. If you've got the money, go for a 5.0 (2011-2014) but you'll be hard pressed to find one under $20k.


If it were me, I'd be looking at a 2005/2006 GT with around 100k miles that I could get for less than $10k. I owned a 2005 GT for a while and had plans to make it a track car myself. They can be made pretty light if you strip some unnecessary weight. The 5 speeds are nearly bulletproof based on my experience and you can build the 3V 4.6L up pretty cheaply if you can do the work yourself. 


Before I sold it, mine was making 306 whp with intake/tune/exhaust. I've seen others make around 400 whp with cams/headers etc... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh wow. Mine is an XLT. With the eBay torsion keys I got, I only had to trim on the bumper and fender liner. I did have to crank back down though, it was bouncing on the bump stops when I first installed them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take it you mean the diff? It does alright, it likes to have some momentum lol. But even if I have to stop and get back on it, it'll grab on one of the wheels. I've never had it just spin one.  </TEXT>
