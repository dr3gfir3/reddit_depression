	<TEXT> During the [Battle of Stamford Bridge](http://www.historynet.com/last-of-the-vikings-stamford-bridge-1066.htm) one single *Viking*, Norwegian Invader, held up the entire English advance at a narrow river crossing to allow time for the Norsemen to regroup. The story goes that he defeated up to 40 soldiers before someone got a makeshift boat and stabbed him with a spear from underneath the bridge.

[Badass of the Week](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/stamfordbridge.html) wrote a piece on him too.
