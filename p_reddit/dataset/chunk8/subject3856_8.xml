	<TEXT> Every chronological order i see is about the historical segments, and we all know thats not the true chronological order, The true chronological order is of the people in the modern day going into the animus to relive these events. Im looking for a chronological list that tells me in what order to read all the comics and books in relation to the games.

So yeah is their a list of chronology for the modern day in games/book/comics? thanks </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The movie cant fit into the games universe (Movie Spoilers) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So i just came back from seeing the movie and i think its pretty good, but in no way could it possibly fit into the main continuity of the games without some serious retcons or writing "we didnt mean what we said in the last movie" into the sequels. Here is a list of things i picked up on that directly go against what we know from the games.


First the most glaring thing, for some reason it seems abstergo hasnt ever seen an apple of Eden, when we know that to be false. 


They also seem to think that their is only one piece of Eden (the apple)


At the beginning of the movie they are not even sure the piece of Eden exists


And dont they already have the locations for all of the pieces of eden.


(now i could be wrong on this one) From the movie it seems that abstergo is only a small subset of the Templar order but from the games it seems abstergo is the whole Templar order


Their are many more small ones like the pronunciation of Alan Rikkins name.


on an unrelated note im pretty sure this movie confirmed that Callum is also a decedent of Arno
