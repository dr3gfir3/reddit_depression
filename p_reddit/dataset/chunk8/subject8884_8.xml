	<TEXT> I go to all my classes and try really hard to study all the time but focusing is still hard because my mind wanders even without touching the internet (which is why cutting has become a strategy to get myself to focus again) I feel like at this point dropping out is my only option which i know would make my parents furious. Hearing other people with similar experiences but still are chugging along makes me feel a lot better, so thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Most of the board games recommended here (betrayal, Eldritch horror, Dead of Winter) are referred to as "Ameritrash" games, as in they're big, garnish, usually luck based, and heavily themed. Their elements are used to create dramatic tension, to make you feel like every decision is big and important and make you win or lose. This is why they lend themselves to great co op, the sense of being a team with a single focus can heighten that experience. I think these are fun, but only when I'm with a group I'm really comfortable with. In general, I am more of a fan of Eurogames which run the gamut the other way - usually reward skillful playing, many interlocking game mechanisms, some to no luck at all, victory points as a measure of who is winning, no player elimination, and generally a pasted on theme. These games are all about elegantly and seamlessly threading mechanics into the core game. There are a lot of variables but none of them should feel heavy or overwhelming. Catan is a classic, and I really enjoy [Terra Mystica](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677/terra-mystica), [St. Petersburg](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9217/saint-petersburg), [Ora et Labora](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70149/ora-et-labora).

2. N/A

3. Co op games are really fun! The couple of issues I run into with with co op games: 

*The "quarterbacking problem"-- If you ever play it with new people you're kind of forced into being the alpha-gamer, because there are optimal decisions that are obvious to you but unbeknownst to new players. Basically those who are too tryhard make the decision for everyone. [Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164236/witch-hunt) deals with well this by having hidden information.

*Elimination-- obviously no one wants to be kicked out of a game halfway through. Secret role games often suffer through this, but I think [Witch Hunt](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164236/witch-hunt) does a fairly good job of keeping the roles interesting even when you're dead.

*Difficulty-- Hard to balance a game that works for all numbers of players. If a game says it plays 2-6, it shouldn't be impossible to beat with 2 and easy as hell with 6. Additionally, for some games you either lose near the beginning or steamroll so hard near the end that the last few rounds feel lackluster. 

Basically I feel like the annoying parts of something like Dota or Overwatch are the same things that ruin a co op board game, magnified by the anonymity of online play.

4. Four players is the standard unless each turn is shot (e.g. [Seven Wonders](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders))
5. I haven't played any :/
6. Around an hour of a really intense game or 3 hours of a more casual game
7. [This article](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1268120#1268120) is one of my favourite things that summarizes board game design approaches.
