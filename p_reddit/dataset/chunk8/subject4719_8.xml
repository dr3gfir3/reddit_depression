	<TEXT> Winter break is tough on me because my depression hits low lows. I fall into the "what if i'm not a good teacher" mindset, along with other dark thoughts. 
This first week back was wonderful because I missed my kids and I love to work. To put a cherry on top of it all i had several graduated seniors visit me... again! It's my second year full-time teaching and each time they come by I am once again reassured that I'm doing well, especially when they visit more than once :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently teaching at one! It depends on your school. I work at a reputable Catholic school, but i earn pennies compared to my peers in the public school system. We had the hardest time finding another math teacher this year, mostly because its hard to find someone who will work for this pay. I love working here, but I cannot make due with this salary for long </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The standard signs are sudden lack of interest, drop in grades, constantly tired, irritable, withdrawn, change of regular behavior, or associating with troublemakers suddenly. Although these are telling signs, they dont always show. Sometimes, you see it in their eyes. Sometimes, you miss it all together.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yikes! I dont know either. I spent my two years tutoring endlessly and applying to schools endlessly. I taught at a tutoring center too. PS. A lot of my clients asked for english tutors, maybe its something to consider, if you can! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! I'm in Chicago, BA in Secondary Ed and Math.
I couldnt get a full time teaching job till 2 years after graduating (and i got it at a private school, so i'm not even where I want to be). I got lucky and had two maternity/paternity leaves in that time through my college professor. 
I feel very caught up in the lacking experience thing still. I tried finding another job last year after 1 year at my school and didnt even get interviews.... but i did get "No"s! that's better than the radio silence. Maybe this year, after 2 under my belt things might change....

Good Luck! dont give up! </TEXT>

2) Mostly! There are programs for algebras that make up their own problems, but they dont always have everything I need. 
3) Nope! I grade each problem and each step, too much work!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I knew most of my life that I wanted to be a teacher, just something that seemed to be a fact in my life (even though parents wanted me to be a doctor lol). I was always drawn to tutoring my peers, did that pretty decently, patiently, I had a way with words and math:). Later I pursued being a teaching assistant at my place of worship and pressured a teacher into letting me grade for him lol

The defining moments for my decision of going into this career were during my junior and senior year of high school. I was depressed and suicidal. A few teachers saved my life by caring and connecting to me. I feel obligated to give that back. I love every second of my choice, I hope you do too </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm Russian, in my culture there is a stigma about mental disorders. I cannot seem to detach myself from the feeling of embarrassment about my depression and anxiety problems. I stopped seeing my therapist a few years back because of that. I want to see a therapist again, but I feel like I have to wait to be off parents insurance first (6 more months)  just cause of this cultural bullshit that's ingrained in me. 
Anyone else going through a similar situation? How do you go about dealing with the stigma/family?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right here!  In order to try and make my depression go away,  when I was younger I promised myself I'd do everything within my power to make my life wonderful.  I've succeeded on the wonderful part (independance, dream job,  amazing relationship, great friends), but my depression still cripples me.  I wish there was a reason for how down I feel but I just don't have one anymore </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some suggestions are bullshit (less homework, lots of extra credit etc) others can be something to think about! You just have to weed them out :) 

why they make them? I think the bullshit suggestions come form students who are trying to do as little as possible to pass the class or have an easy way out. Others I think are genuine. I had a student suggest doing more projects the next time I teach the course. I realized she was right, doing more mathematical applications would be amazing for my course. Doing that this year and i see a significant difference in students understanding some concepts! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had an intense discussion with my a colleague about accepting late work or not. We are high school math teachers. One of our points was that students may receive extra practice when making up the work.The other point was that students will just copy off each other and not actually do the work. Neither of us provides students with extra credit opportunities other than on an examination. Are we both right, maybe? 

What policy do you have on late credit/make up work?   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I'm at a wonderful school with wonderful, but it is a private school so the salary is very low and I cannot justify staying here much longer. I have a letter of rec from the department chair from last year ( our contract came in in May, so I wasnt sure if I get to keep the job or not) . As I apply to other jobs this time around, should I say 'do not contact the school' just in case? I do not know that etiquette, and i do not want to lose my job if i cannot find another

thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work at a private school so our dress code isnt very relaxed. However - The gym teachers (who have some cool factor to them cause they're coaches) are always in sweats/sweatshirts/sports pants. I'm like you though! If I dont dress nice, i'm not taken seriously. Maybe its cause i'm very young looking? Maybe you are too??! I dont think wearing leggings make you "cool" but comfy clothes are a luxury i'm definitely jealous of! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion the best way to prepare is to seize any opportunity to teach a lesson. Practice, practice and more practice is the best way to prepare!! There isnt much else you can really do, you kinda just have to dive in head first with all the knowledge you've accumulated through your schooling and experience!!  Good Luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was raised in a religious household too. I did not tell my parents my lack of spirituality because it is none of their business, and i'm sure they'd react like your father did. If i were you i'd just not talk about religion with dad. If he brings it up, smile and nod. Why cause friction if you live together?? Wait till you move out and then voice your opinions as much as you want. 
Now, I"m not saying he's right to be verbally abusive towards you. But as you probably know, religious parents are ridiculously stubborn. No matter what you do, you will not change his mind </TEXT>
