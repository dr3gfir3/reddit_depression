	<TEXT> I'm not saying the game's not emotional (I think the opposite). It just seems like a weird thing to give an award for. Not for the writing, but for the emotional impact. That's super subjective. I know all awards are subjective, but this seems even more so.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [The Bay ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk2E1CoGe98)

In all seriousness, it really is super painful to watch the Bay ending. I've never chosen it, or even watched it in full. The little I saw was more than enough to kill me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think I was consciously expecting it. Although it was somewhere in the back of my head. Being paralyzed is probably my greatest fear, and my thoughts kept going to what mental state I would be in if I was in Chloe's shoes. In that respect, I guess I did see it coming. It's a crazy moment, and a very real moment. It's one of the most heartbreaking, tear jerking, horrifying, and oddly touching moments in the whole game. It's not my favorite moment from the game, but it's definitely the most memorable. I'm not going to forget that scene anytime soon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first time you reunite with Chloe. That was a super emotional scene for me. Starts out extremely relieving, then gets worrying, then scary, then tear-jerky, then super touching. The tears be real.

Honorable mentions. 

The Bae ending: I don't care what anyone says, I love the way that ending plays out and I think it's perfect. 

The Beach: Right before the nightmare, after you've saved Chloe. Not much to say other than that it's a beautiful scene. It's a quiet moment with a tornado raging in the background, a lovely little paradox. 

Sitting in the Two Whales: The scenes with Warren and Joyce and Frank are great and all, but the quiet moment you get to have sitting and you and Chloe's booth at the Two Whales is something else entirely. It's the final real quiet moment of the game, and it's the moment when I realized how close we were to the end of the journey. It was oddly bittersweet. Outside the tornado was destroying Arcadia, but inside I had a moment with my thoughts. I stayed sitting for a *very* long time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I love her looks. Her pretty face and unique hair style. Her beautiful, slim body. Her rebelious style. Her cheerful and cheeky smile, which fills my heart with joy. Her both powerful and soft voice, which calms me down.

Yep.

...that's all I really have to say. 

(I lied. I have something else to say.) There's something comforting about Chloe. I find myself thinking about her (usually cuddling with Max or hanging out with Max or something) a lot. Like, first thing in the morning, last thing before I go to sleep, whenever I'm bored, whenever I'm beat down, whenever I'm really happy. I miss Chloe too, but at the same time I don't, because she's always floating around in my head.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought the ending would involve a choice to rewind and save Rachel, and let Chloe be happy with her, but she doesn't get to see Max again. Basically it'd come down to Chloe being happy, and Max not being able to see her, or not catching Jeff/saving Rachel/saving the town but getting to stay with Chloe. I had pondered the sacrifice Chloe/sacrifice town idea, but I didn't think it'd be *that* straightforward. I don't mind though; simpler is often better.

Also, I expected an epic smooch when Max first reunites with Chloe after escaping the Dark Room. I wanted that kiss Dontnod! I thought it'd be an epic moment where Max makes it back, unsure if she made it or not, then she sees Chloe, gets overcome with emotion, and runs over and (determinant) kisses her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We feel you. You can expect the emotions from this game to be all you think about for a little while. I think I'm past the "emotional wreck" stage, but LiS (very specifically Max and Chloe) is still one of the only things I think about. It's what I'm thinking about when I wake up, and it's always the last thing I think about before I go to sleep. I like it this way though. 

I played Life is Strange twice. Once whilst the episodes were releasing. Then over the 5 days leading up to New Years Eve I replayed the game (quite poetic, if I do say so myself). Like you, I think it's going to be something I return to every few months or so, just to take it all in. Maybe once a year.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think "Season 2" will essentially be a new IP. Max and Chloe's story is over, they've said that. If you made Life is Strange without them, without Arcadia, and without rewind, would it still be Life is Strange?

But at the same time what I think makes Life is Strange Life is Strange is the tone, the art, and the themes. If they make a game with the same quirkiness and nostalgic feel, a similar soft art style, that revolves around the general theme of growing up and discovering your identity, it's the successor to LiS in my book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think euthanizing her is the right choice. When Chloe rationalizes it, it makes sense. She was already dying, just slowly and painfully. She was costing her parents a fortune, making their lives infinitely harder. And she had just had the best day of her life, seeing her best friend again; she wanted to go out on a high note. But that wasn't really my thought process when I made my choice. I saw the distress she was in, that she didn't want to live like this any more. I then put myself in her shoes and asked myself what I would be feeling. Then I accepted her request. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's how I see it playing out: for a few months, they're both pretty fucked up. They're not mad at each other or anything like that, but they are both badly fucked up. But they're there for each other, so they are able to pull through. I feel like they wouldn't head to Seattle and Max's parents immediately, but after a few weeks they would end up there. That's where they stay for a while.

I'm a Pricefield kinda guy, so after maybe 5 months I can see Max and Chloe properly start going out (and doing other things, giggity). I don't think that the day after Max sacrifices the town they start banging or anything. I get the feeling it would take quite a while for them to get to a place where they can actually fully maintain a romantic relationship. But after that I can see the two of them sticking together. I can see them being together still on January 23rd, 2016, living together and being all cute and shit. Max is chasing her dreams of being a photographer and is finding minor, growing success. Maybe she has a job at a Starbucks or something. Chloe is working multiple jobs, maybe at an auto shop, a tattoo parlor, and/or a diner. 

I feel, like many other, that Max has some variation of PTSD. She's a little paranoid at times. She's more concerned with Chloe's well being than anything else. She hates needles. Nightmares are frequent. Thankfully she has a big blue teddy bear to sleep with. 

Chloe is a lot more positive. She's more active, more ambitious, more generous, more open minded. Her hair isn't fully blue anymore, but she does keep a few blue streaks on Max's request. 

Edit: Also Max has no powers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Returning to the Original Timeline is Episode 4. I wrote extensively about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3zwkx6/ep5_spoilers_your_favorite_moments/cypxp7g) if you want to read about why, but I'll try and break it down for you quickly: returning to the alt-timeline and seeing Chloe again was the most relieving moment EVER after going through the whirlwind of bullshit that was the ending of Episode 3 and the start of Episode 4. I was so happy in that moment, and I was able to just forget about everything else that had happened and everything that was to come. Technically, the scene is also beautifully executed. This scene was super impactful *in a good way*. 

I feel like too often when we think "impactful", we think about what were the most depressing and tear-jerking moments. But I feel like the moments that had a positive impact on me were far more meaningful that the ones that left me a weeping wreck. Like the ending. The Bay ending is so much more emotional and drawn out and many would say "impactful", but for me the Bae ending is infinitely more meaningful. My takeaway from the Bae ending is so much more positive and constructive than my impressions of the Bay ending, and that means a lot for me. </TEXT>

The issues of bullying and depression. Going through your own Chrysalis. Everyone who plays the game finds something unique to latch onto. It makes the story feel personal. It stops being a game. This community is so incredible because, as cliche as it is to say, Life is Strange is more than just a game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember Riley Rewind! "Riley Rewind December 12th, Riley Rewind December 12th!" 2013, yeah?

It was a fun concept, very well made, had a nice style to it with the comic art bits and the vlog parts, and the story was pretty cool (if not predictable and cliche). I liked most of the characters, despite the fact that the acting was very meh. But then again, Anna Akana was in Ant-Man last year, so what do I know? :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "partner in crime-partner in time" quote is super cute.

"Since you're the mysterious superhero, I'll be your loyal chauffeur and companion." 

The whole interaction about Chloe wanting to steal the chair is one of my favorites.

The pool scene is great, but when Chloe tells Max her plan to sneak into the pool is incredibly cute. Chloe with that "impish look" on her face, "splish splash", and Max saying "hella" all combine for cuteness levels over nine thousand. 

But by far the most adorable moment for me was when Chloe photobombs Max's selfie in Episode 3. So *fucking cute*!

	<TEXT> The ending of the game left me feeling profound emptiness. It was...strange, to say the least. I sacrificed the town, and was really happy with my ending; it was the ending I wanted, as fucked up as that may sound. It was the ending I predicted, and the ending I hoped for. I remember watching the final scene, Obstacles ringing through my head, and feeling completely empty yet having a faint smile on my face. When the credits had finally finished and I turned off my PS4, I remember feeling content. Yet empty. It was weird. I didn't really go through a post game depression, but that emptiness still lingered for weeks and weeks. It still comes and goes.  </TEXT>

Yes, you should. Because you are. 

While Chloe Price isn't *necessarily* my dream girl (be kinda like dating myself, lol), I do get what you're saying. LiS has made me, and a *lot* of other people, long for a soulmate. Whether it's a significant other or a best friend, I want to find my Chloe (or maybe the Max to *my* Chloe). And someday, I will. Fuck, maybe I already have and just haven't noticed. I'm also getting done with high school this summer. I'm looking forward to it, whether I get into college or not, because I just want to finally make my life my own. Chase those dreams, yeah? Easy peasy or not so much, I just want to get to *live*. So I understand you there too. 

And because you mentioned martial arts, what martial art do you do? I love martial arts too, so I was just curious.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think if any Telltale title deserves attention, it's Tales from the Borderlands. That game is their most cohesive, well acted, well written, and well produced game. That said it's a completely different kind of game than Life is Strange, despite genre similarities. The only categories where I'd say it can be compared with Life is Strange are acting caliber and art direction; Tales has the best collective cast of any game EVER (Troy, Ashley, Laura, Hardwick, etc, etc, ETC) and a gorgeous art style.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WALL OF TEXT INCOMING THEORY ALERT THEORY ALERT

I think the way the photos work in general kind of breaks the rules of Chaos Theory. It's like whenever Max goes back into a photo, she's in a weird pocket of reality where normal rules don't apply. For example, when Max let's William die in order to the "original" timeline, everything should've been fucked up...or at least different. Why? Because butterfly effect. First, she burned the photo. Then she had a super emotional heart to heart with Chloe, which Chloe would *definitely* remember and would have probably changed certain aspects of their current relationship (you know, considering that her dad dies right after Max tells Chloe that she will never abandon her and all that mushy crap *wipes tear*). Those seem like major changes to the original timeline. My theory is that whatever Max does in these pockets of time doesn't actually have any affect on the timeline. This also applies to what she says. For example, in Jefferson's classroom in Episode 5 you can be super rude to him and make it pretty clear that you're going to bust him (seriously, Jefferson would have to be the biggest idiot on the planet to have not picked up on that), but it doesn't change Jefferson's plans, actions, or attitude towards Max. (Similarly this applies to what Max tells Chloe in the final William photo scene.) The only things that matter in that time pocket are a) Max *giving* him the photo and b) Max *sending* David the text. Similarly in the William photo, the only things that matter are a) hiding the keys and forcing William to take the bus (or not) and b) making a mark on the fireplace. The only things that end up altering the future are not things Max does, but rather things that she lets happen or influences. She can manipulate objects, but her actions and presence seems completely irrelevant. Further "proof" is the final (or second to last for you Bay people *grrr*) photo rewind, when you meet Chloe outside the End of the World Party. Firstly, I know. All Max does in that scene is *speak*, and it changes the future. I know. I said her words don't matter. And this is still true. But I also said that "The only things that end up altering the future are...things that she lets happen or influences." In this photo pocket, Max actually uses her words to convince Chloe to leave the party. She *influences* her. Chloe makes the choice to go, not Max. Similarly to Max convincing William to take the bus after he gives up looking for the keys. Anyways, continuing after that clarification. As soon as they leave the photo, Max remembers nothing she said. What confuses me is what exactly Max *does* remember, but that sounds like a discussion for another time. Max not remembering anything she did in that area is "proof" that her own actions, thoughts, and speech make no change. She herself literally reverts to her previous state, and she's the fucking time traveler! 

So yeah, that's my "photo time-pocket" theory. Everything Max does or says in the photo time-pockets is irrelevant *unless* it results in someone else doing differently *in that specific space*.
