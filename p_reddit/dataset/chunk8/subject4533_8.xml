	<TEXT> Dont know why youre being downvoted. I was in love with the movie up until the laughable "realisation" train scene and the following climax. It was a big let down, but i guess a big climax is always necessary in movies like c2.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was really disappointed with the climax of The Conjuring 2. Such a nice story that builds up to Lorraine yelling words at a demon while Ed hangs on to a goddamn curtain that is loosing its rings one by one. CMON. 

But probs to Wan for ending the film on such a beautiful note. Ed and Lorraine dancing together was just the perfect ending.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely agree. I think the first film worked very well on its own. It didn't need two sequels to elaborate on the "further" or whatever it was called. 

 My favourite part about the Insidious series is the title intros. The words covering the entire screen and the violins lowering in pitch are really effective at setting the mood. They are also terrifying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The movie was definitely a wild ride. I enjoyed the first 3/4 up until the point where the Warrens had the "realisation" and ran back to the house. The movie had some great moments (the painting scene was really well done), but the end just felt rushed and I was left disappointed. The credits scene was really creepy, too.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Its been over three weeks since it was released. What are everyone's thoughts? Still similar? 

I have grown to enjoy the record a whole lot more than my first few listens. With that being said, there are a lot of songs I simply have no interest in. My most played tracks are *Points*, *Put That Away and Talk To Me*, *Waves Know Shores* (except for the weird blip noises towards the end) and *Modern Soul* (my absolute favorite off the record).

I would rate his discog like this:

1. Enough Thunder EP
2. James Blake
3. Overgrown
4. The Color In Anything
5. Klavierwerke EP </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the best films I have seen this year. I can't stop thinking about it. I really love movies where the characters are stuck in an unfathomable situation and  Green Room does that but up to fucking 100. The gun negotiation scene HAS to be my scene of the year. Such a WTF moment where I and the characters knew they were in for something deadly. 

Potential spoiler questions:

- What else were the Neo-Nazis talking about? I understood their talk about the green room situation but I felt like they were also mentioning past events and such? 


- Why did the Nazi leader kill the other guys with laced heroin?


- Did you enjoy the ending?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finally gave this film a re-watch after finishing a list of films I needed to see. I just can't get it out of my head. One of the best zombie movies I have seen! Something about the world and all the little details we are shown are so damn interesting to me. 

Favorite scenes throughout: 

- The letter Jim's parents write. It really humanized the effects of the infection for me, something that other zombie films fail to do.
- When the four characters go shopping.
- The rocket Jim notices through the trees after escaping his execution/death. Can anyone explain this scene for me? it definitely felt like his little own "moment" before going completely rambo on the soldiers. Is it supposed to indicate that there is maybe normal life elsewhere? Or the realization that Jim is just a tiny part of life in general? 

I really want to talk about all aspects of this film!

Also id like to mention... i ordered this LAST OCTOBER. Crazy wait time.

	<DATE> 2016-03-18 01:41:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What an amazing experience. Late at night, the screen was shrouded in trees, a full moon and a little bit of wind. Probably the best movie i have seen at an outdoor cinema. It was so eerie when the wind would rustle the trees during parts of the movie. 

Oh, and the movie. HOLY SHIT. Could not stop thinking about it afterwards. The last few scenes really stuck with me. Really unique atmosphere. It almost reminded me of Blair Witch Project. 

Anyone else have positive experiences with this movie? And a side question, can anyone link/tell me some interesting things about the lore?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trying to wrap my head around this one. Same goes for Bondax (5mil followers) and Gold Panda (5.6mil) who get less than 100k plays on some tracks. What causes this? I have considered fake followers, but come on. 

It could be the number of tracks they have currently uploaded. Over 700 tracks? I can imagine how annoying it would be with Mad Decent being everywhere on peoples feeds.

	<TEXT> What garryyo said:

It's like that moment in gone home where you realize there is no conspiracy or ghost or anything other than the complete mundane. You are disappointed, but you are mostly disappointed in yourself for thinking that there was something else, not at the game. and i am impressed with the game, for making me think things that aren't real and getting me caught up trying to figure things out that might have a simpler, more plausible explanation.

This game is rife with the feeling of how unfair and dumb normal life can be, and how your mind races to much more exciting things when it gets the chance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comment from Soundcloud on the matter:

Beyond the full-year financials for 2014, which reflect those of a company in a strong growth stage, they show that, in 2015, we secured $77m of incremental capital, some of which came from our existing investors, demonstrating their belief in the future of the company, and the rest of which is a flexible credit line from Tennenbaum Capital Partners, an attractive option for companies like SoundCloud, who have a solid credit rating and are on a clear path to global success.
