	<TEXT> Yeah I absolutely don't understand the idea of buy every single game Microsoft puts out so that one day we can get a good ip game. That's fanboyism through and through really. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find the official [events calendar](http://www.pvzgw2.com/events-calendar) a little confusing to look out. The fact you can't see exact dates until you click on the icons and that theres no real detail about what the events are (even one that have passed). I think it'd be cool for the community for this to be a place where we can easily see. When the next Community Challenge, Hero Showcase, Rux Appearance and Mystery Portal is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved Dead rising 2 back in the day and really like 3. I'm excited for 4 and would like the collection but 40 is quite a bit of money for three last ten games? I normally don't like remasters but with this series I've always wanted to play them all so thinking it will be an exception. Are they just ports like resi? Or are there noticeable updates? Also it doesn't have ceased zero or case west does it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really don't get the hype people had for this title. It looked like a generic action adventure game really. I like those type of games and think we need more but not enough to pay 40 on release  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This generation is the generation of games that I've decided I need to be cautious with. I've preordered and bought on release many games last year that I either didn't like or was massively disappointed with or just flat out didn't work. It shouldn't be the case but it is with all these companies just out to make money. I'm giving it a month and if it's looking positive still I will happily buy the game as it seems like my kind of thing. </TEXT>
