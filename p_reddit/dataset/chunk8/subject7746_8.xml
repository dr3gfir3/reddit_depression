	<TEXT> I figured as much. Because the tactical voting as your example indicates may happen but without knowing how much disillusionment you can't put it into a model. Also, a lot of behaviors those voting are recursive.

By that I mean you are a die hard (or even probably just agree with his sentiment) Bernie voter, for example.

So many possibilities exist to bucket this person in that it's just too much work really. You could make an argument that he - who would vote for D - may vote for A, B, or C.

However, A (Trump) or B (Hillary) both represent something completely different from what you want, and C (third party) is dangerous. Tactical voting may be more powerful but at what cost? You can put them in as many as 4 buckets. Then what? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What exactly is honest voting defined as?

Also...


Let's say you have a spectrum of 100 people (for now without party affiliation) - on one end low income, low education, and on the other high income, post-graduate education. Is there a model that would account for the voting patterns of this group? And maybe repeat it 500,000 times to model a general election?


Then you would add a variable to include party affiliation, same 100 people but every so often randomize all 100 to be either Democrat or Republican.


Finally, assume you're in different states where you have a variety of demographic factors. So the spectrum skews low or high occasionally.


What do you think would happen? Would these findings be valuable? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> MCOC is really turning into WoW </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-03 17:08:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Due to challenger rating I wrote this up:

tl;dr - MCOC is now WoW in terms of design philosophy.

I'm guessing they are going to WoW raid/dungeon boss route.

Usually you capped at 60/70/80/etc depending on expansion, end game dungeon bosses were +2 levels higher and raid bosses were +3 levels, compared to cap.

You had to gear for them, you needed 8-10% additional hit chance to never miss special attacks on dungeon bosses, but you never needed to always hit.

But raid bosses required about 15% additional hit chance to never miss with abilities, including things like Taunt for tanking. And for entry level raiders, this was impossible without sacrificing some other stats. However, in OVERGEARED (4\* 5/50+or  5\* 3/45+ in MCOC) content meaning using gear from later raids, doing these encounters became trivial as your stats were so much better compared to what was needed to survive and do consistent damage. Or at least that's the intention.

Dungeon/questing can be described as this:

Beginner/Normal is like early game content in WoW. Simple and easy to learn the fights without them being overly aggressive.

Heroic is a bit more challenging and like higher level dungeons, without too many additional mechanics. You need some level of gear in WoW to do high level dungeons, but you can get away with reasonably high gear near cap level.

Master mode is like Heroic Dungeons in WoW - first time difficult, but eventually manageable and supposed to introduce/tease you to Raid level difficulties. Some of the MCOC fights, especially Road to Labyrinth, train you on length of fights or avoiding damage.

RoL and LoL are meant to be equivalent to Heroic and higher Raid difficulty - with bosses potentially instakilling you unless you had the strats down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember the days when I played WoW.

We had gear that added % additive to crit.

After the first expansion, it was changed to adding to flat values (ratings), but based on level.

Example:
14 crit rating for 1% additional crit chance at level 60.

Turned into 22 crit rating required for 1% crit chance at level 70.

I just hope that the crit rating for crit % stays constant. </TEXT>
