	<TEXT> Sure but it is from memory but I am sure someone will correct my mistakes.  Let's see....the earth is 160 million meters in diameter.  Let's assume he keeps a constant velocity  so we can ignore acceleration.

His velocity is distance over time so 160 million meters divided by 2 seconds.  So his velocity is 80 million m/s.

His kinetic energy is 0.5mv^2 and we'll assume he is 100 kg so his kenetic energy is 320,000, 000 Gigajoules.

That's  roughly 78 megatons of TNT or 5200 Hiroshima nukes per punch.  I think they underestimated the collateral damage of each of those punches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved this cartoon.  But come on, what's batman contribution pulling the flash out of the speed zone.  If Superman and Wonder Women can't do it what additional help is he.  His super power is money and intelligence not strength.
