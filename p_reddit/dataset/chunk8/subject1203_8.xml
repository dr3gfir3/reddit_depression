	<TITLE> How to upload an apk to Android Emulator? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-12 18:45:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,
I am a UI designer and want to see how an android app looks and feels on the different screen sizes within android.
I have downloaded the android emulator and have created a couple of virtual devices for testing.  My developer sent me the apk via G-drive and I have a difficult time figuring out how I can open this app on the emulator (Android Studio). I have read that I can just drop it, but it does not seeem to work as probably I am doing it all wrong. 
From any android phone I can just open and install the apk on my test phones but the emulator gives me problems.
I would appreciate any help. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why would you be interested in knowing what diet or exercise has worked for people are almost the same as you and have very similar life situations? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wonder if it is only me who would like to know what diet and exercise has worked for people who are in the same shoes like me. Like people who are the same age as me, who make the same money as me, who have the same amount of free time as me, who weigh the same, who have a sedentary life like me, and so on. I am sure there are people out there who go through the same obstacles and would love to somehow connect with them and form groups to make it more motivational for all of us.
What would be the advantages and disadvantages of such groups? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your valuable comment.
The timer is basically an integral part of the app. 
When a friend requests you to "synco" you get 5 minutes to respond with a picture and a short caption with what you are doing at the moment.
Thanks again!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Annuit I just have one question if you don't mind and still remember. Did you use any special character for signing up?
I am asking because another user reports the same issue and we just don't find and understand this bug.
All the best and thank you! </TEXT>
