Been having this issue for the last week with my Nexus 6 running 7.1.1 on 4g. If I switch to 3g zero issues.

Have had no issues since I switched to Cricket over the summer till this past week.

Just now I thought I'd give a VPN a chance. Switched back to 4G. Lost Google Play connectivity. Switched back to 3G. Got access again. Installed PIA from the Play Store. Switched back to 4G lost Google Play services. Turned on VPN. Google Play came back. </TEXT>

1) settings  wireless   networks  more  Network settings reset  reset network settings. Then after that's done restart your phone. Probably won't work. But worth a shot.

2) If you can go to a cricket store and try another sim card. </TEXT>

You need to be root to delete the system apps as far as I know to then be able to save changes to your build.prop file.

If you have instructions or proof that you can do it without root I'm sure the OP would appreciate it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This should be your episode order 

https://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall id=80009 lid=7

The first OVS series came out in 1992. The second in 1994.
The third didn't come out till 2003. And when that happened they changed the name of the shoe around. It had different voice actors. 

If you use the episode numbers and title from the link if should all work for you.

FYI there are also a quite a few other Tenchi shows and movies
