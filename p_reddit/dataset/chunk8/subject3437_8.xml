	<TEXT> It depends on the setting, but I'd like to see more vertical exploration. More stuff to do in the sky or below ground rather than just a wider map.

Caves and twisty mazes in a coral reef at the bottom of shallow part of the sea, a truly deep trench with an Argonian city in the inky black depths, floating islands in the sky, a shanty town in the canopy of a forest, airships cutting through the skies. Steep cliff cities that are very narrow but have multiple terraces of height, a crumbling dwemer ruin suspended over a massive void. Mines that crawl ever deeper into the ground, caves that go on for miles with dead ends, places that are too narrow for most to pass and have underwater portions, and even things like a massive tree that has an entire settlement inside it's hollowed trunk.

A return of Acrobatics and Climb ( all this vertical stuff is going to demand climbing and basic parkour stuff like climbing surfaces, mounting, and swinging ), and especially flight spells to take advantage of the open air. Teleportation magic would be useful as well, but between fast travel and flight, not really required.

I'm not sure it'd really work - current AI pathing is pretty awful and I don't think it could handle having to deal with flying and swimming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure if sarcasm, but as with all lore given the nature of Dragon Breaks, it is open for interpretation:

Formatting spoilers is a mess, so [check this](http://pastebin.com/Bc14mHfX) for my reasoning.

In the end, it is mostly speculation and will probably require TES6 lore to figure out what really went down. </TEXT>
