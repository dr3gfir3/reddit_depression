	<TEXT> I get it, really. I mean you can try and keep trying and see if that feeling comes back, but if it doesn't then what? If things get better that's great, but if they don't then it could end up being nothing but resentment for you both. This stuff is never easy.

	<TEXT> You're absolutely allowed to put yourself first, regardless of if anyone comes forward here and tells you you're an asshole - you're not. Folks tend to come and say stuff like that whenever it comes to someone ending things with someone with mental health issues. I have them myself - and I had a partner who had some pretty severe ones, and I just couldn't do it anymore. I ended up making myself really sick, and that's when I decided I had to walk away. 

What you have to remember is, you're not actually responsible for her wellbeing in the long run. As much as it's probably going to be painful and there's a possibility that she *might* do something unpleasant, she also might not. It's great that you've chosen not to name the things she's battling, because people have a habit of having prejudged ideas about how stuff will pan out. Whatever you choose to do, you're going to worry about her obviously, but you have to worry about yourself too. That's absolutely okay.  </TEXT>

You're getting FREE education in Europe. You're complaining about not having money to get haircuts and go to bars etc, whilst talking about how you can't get the same financial help other people can, most students I know including myself have a job as well as having to PAY for their education, many of them are grateful to survive on ramen, and don't care about bars and haircuts. 

There are tons of homeless people, lots of them also commit suicide. Welcome to being an adult.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds like the opposite end of the spectrum to what I was living with - and very obsessive too which makes me wonder if they were battling actual OCD or the like. It's really, REALLY hard to remain objective when you're actually living IN a situation, because folks on the outside will almost always say, *have you tried this?*, and you might have tried everything so many time that it makes your head dizzy. When I was at the point where I was leaving stuff on the bed, I was genuinely at a loss for what else to do aside from leaving myself, or asking them to leave. In the end, I asked them to leave, which hurt like hell because we were good friends, and still are. It goes to show that you aren't always going to be compatible with living with all of your friends if you have opposing domestic habits. That's the short version, it was pretty complicated in the end. We're definitely better off for not living in the same space now.  </TEXT>
