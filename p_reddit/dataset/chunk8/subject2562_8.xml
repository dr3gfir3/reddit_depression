	<TEXT> Have you considered booking a match break (hotel room + ticket) through Thomas Cook?

I recently travelled to the UK from Australia, and like you I had a small window of opportunity to catch a game. As luck would have it, that meant the City match. 

The membership ballot was my main official avenue for tickets, but I wouldn't know for sure if I'd succeeded until relatively soon before the game.

I ended up booking through Thomas Cook, and though it was certainly an expensive option for seats in the NW quadrant at OT, at least I could be certain I'd secured tickets.

Note they apparently don't let customers outside the EU book these tickets any more, but a friend was able to book from the UK on my behalf and use my name as the actual guest for the hotel room and ticket. </TEXT>
