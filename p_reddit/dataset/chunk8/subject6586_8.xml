	<TEXT> One of our Classics Professors has a new free online course coming out which might be interesting: http://rdg.ac/FLvirtualrome 

He's using his own award-winning virtual model of ancient Rome to show what the city would have been like at its peak, and to try and answer some common questions: 

Why was this ancient city built where it was? Did all roads really lead to Rome? How was drinking water supplied to the citys million inhabitants? Where did Romans worship their gods and meet their political masters? And which buildings provided a backdrop for the spectacular events that both celebrated emperors and secured the loyalty of the masses?

He's also keen to take part in an AMA, so let us know if you're interested in talking to him here in the community!
