	<TEXT> They feel the line has always been, corporate taxes are too high. And you should remove them to 'stimulate business'. And you're right, that money ends up as profits hidden in offshore accounts. It doesn't trickle down. Trickle down was always complete nonsense. And there's never been any proof that any of it works. Corporations usually spend other peoples' money. I say the tax rate is too low. When GE can outsource profits and domesticate losses and still get a billion dollar tax refund, the system is definitely broken, but not in the way they'd have you believe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But they also see people like Bezos and Zuckerberg. It's the phenomenon of Shark Tank syndrome. Everyone believes if they start a business, they will become rich. But still the wealthy benefit from startups that succeed and fail. The wealthy always win because the people believe it's possible. But it's not possible without the wealthy. If you all remember the "you didn't build it" nonsense in 2012, it's that. Every step along the way, I can point out how someone didn't build it alone. You always need someone else's money. Trump would have you believe that he built an empire from the ground up. He "worked" hard, had a dream. And 40 million of his father's money.

Even Zuckerberg would still be sitting in a dorm room somewhere if he didn't have investors, which he screwed over.

The American dream was snatched away by corporations. Their purpose is only to make profit. And some of the people along the way decide that profit is the only motivator. American workers cost too much, let's hire cheaper workers over seas. Product safety costs too much, let's skip the safe materials. Benefits cost too much, let's lay off our workforce and contract it out. All of these poor people are taking too much benefit from the state, let's take away their benefits. All these regulations are costing us profits, let's do away with them.

American corporations took away jobs. Then they took away benefits. Then they took away our representation. Now they want to take away our protections. And next is the restrictions preventing them from open free range fascism.

There are few who can be convinced on the ideas. For the rest, there's personal attacks on political opponents. There's always going to be those few that share the ideology.

If corporations openly operated the way our polictics does, could you imagine the TV commercials Coke would run against Pepsi?

Conservatives have been lied to for so long, they are fearful and hostile and have no civility left. And liberals have had enough. They've decided to lose some of their civility as well. And our governance is open conflict. The wealthy get more wealthy. The middle class keeps shrinking. You can't support a family on a single middle class income as you could through the 1990's. And while President Obama did the best he could at trying to regain the economy lost, Wallstreet rebounded. Mainstreet, not so much. But it was because mainstreet took the hit that wallstreet could rebound.  Taxes make our government work. And because corporations have caused such distress in our population, they should bear the brunt of repairing it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For too many people, that's not a feasible option. First, a person must have the ability to change jobs. If you're living by the paycheck, this is a non-starter. Then You'd have to pay first last and deposit on a new place. Then you'd need to have enough to physically make the move and pay for it. So, we're talking $6k just to move somewhere that makes sense. And all the while, not earning income during the process. For people who have large amounts of savings, this can be done. For those with no savings, it's not possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The real question is, why are alt-right conservatives showing up in Berkeley? The area is not conservative. The state is not conservative. Why are they coming in wearing helmets, masks, and goggles? And let me tell you now, if you support trump, you are an alt-right conservative. Otherwise, you would have supported one of the mainstream conservative candidates. We know why the alt-right has been emboldened. We know they are violent and deceitful. We know they typically carry weapons hoping to use them. Why was Berkeley police not there to protect peaceful protesters? Could the police be alt-right too? </TEXT>
