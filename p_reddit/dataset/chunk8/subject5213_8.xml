	<TEXT> Not sure if this counts, but I I'll tell it anyway.  I was raised pretty sheltered and was really naive to many things.  I knew not to talk to strangers but was brought up to believe we lived in a safe neighborhood with friendly neighbors.  

One afternoon when I was around 9 I was walking alone a few streets from where I lived and out of no where this guy called out to me from his garage.  I stopped walking but before I could respond he was already walking towards me on the sidewalk.  The guy had to be early to mid 40s.  A little heavier.    

"Hey!  You look like a pretty strong kid.  Could you help me?  I need to move a kitchen table inside the house." He pointed his thumb towards the house.  

Like I said I was pretty naive and didn't even know anything about pedophiles but the entire thing raised the hairs on the back of the neck.  Sirens inside me were just started flashing.  I just remember running away and not looking back.  Ran straight home.  

It took years to even realize how alarming it was that he asked a scrawny 9 year old boy to help him move heavy furniture.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a kid I'd see my cool older cousin's Blockbuster membership card and couldn't wait to be old enough to get one.  By the time I was 18 I signed up for this new thing called Netflix instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use Alton Brown's recipe!  It goes in the oven cooked with broth and always turns out perfect.  I add herbs, onion/garlic powder to mine so it doesn't taste so much like plain brown rice.   </TEXT>
