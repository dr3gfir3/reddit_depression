	<TEXT> It's really hard to explain why;
1) The blue area around the crease doesn't really mean anything.

2) Fighting is allowed and celebrated. The  McCarron fight went on for ever, he said it was weird and scary for 20,000 people to so into it.

3) You can just jump on a guy and beat him and only he gets a penalty. Ex. The goalie interference call when Weber and Danault immediately jump on the Leaf player.

He also could never find the puck. It seems following the play is a skill. 
He enjoyed the game but got fed up with all the after the whistle stuff eventually. </TEXT>
