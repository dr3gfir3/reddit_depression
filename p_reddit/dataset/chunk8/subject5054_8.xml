	<TEXT> Study: [Elevated atmospheric CO2 negatively impacts photosynthesis through radiative forcing and physiology-mediated climate feedback](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071733/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Increasing atmospheric CO2 affects photosynthesis involving directly increasing leaf carboxylation rates, stomatal closure, and climatic effects. The direct effects are generally thought to be positive leading to increased photosynthesis, while its climatic effects can be regionally positive or negative. These effects are usually considered to be independent from each other, but they are in fact coupled through interactions between land surface exchanges of gases and heat and the physical climate system. In particular, stomatal closure reduces evapotranspiration and increases sensible heat emissions from ecosystems, leading to decreased atmospheric moisture and precipitation and local warming. We use a coupled earth system model to attribute the influence of the increase in CO2 on gross primary productivity (GPP) during the period of 19302011. In our model, CO2 radiative effects cause climate change that has only a negligible effect on global GPP (a reduction of 0.9  2% during the last 80 years) because of opposite responses between tropical and northern biomes. On the other hand, CO2 physiological effects on GPP are both positive, by increased carboxylation rates and water use efficiency (7.1  0.48% increase), and negative, by vegetation-climate feedback reducing precipitation, as a consequence of decreased transpiration and increased sensible heat in areas without water limitation (2.7  1.76% reduction).When considering the coupled atmosphere-vegetation system, negative climate feedback on photosynthesis and plant growth due to the current level of CO2 opposes 2938% of the gains from direct fertilization effects. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Rising atmospheric CO2 stimulates photosynthesis and productivity of forests, offsetting CO2 emissions. Elevated CO2 experiments in temperate planted forests yielded ~23% increases in productivity over the initial years. Whether similar CO2 stimulation occurs in mature evergreen broadleaved forests on low-phosphorus (P) soils is unknown, largely due to lack of experimental evidence. This knowledge gap creates major uncertainties in future climate projections as a large part of the tropics is P-limited. Here, we increased atmospheric CO2 concentration in a mature broadleaved evergreen eucalypt forest for three years, in the first large-scale experiment on a P-limited site. We show that tree growth and other aboveground productivity components did not significantly increase in response to elevated CO2 in three years, despite a sustained 19% increase in leaf photosynthesis. Moreover, tree growth in ambient CO2 was strongly P-limited and increased by ~35% with added phosphorus. The findings suggest that P availability may potentially constrain CO2-enhanced productivity in P-limited forests; hence, future atmospheric CO2 trajectories may be higher than predicted by some models. As a result, coupled climatecarbon models should incorporate both nitrogen and phosphorus limitations to vegetation productivity in estimating future carbon sinks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Primarily due to its mass. Mars has only ~10% the mass of Earth and 38% of the gravity, while Venus has ~82% the mass of Earth and ~90% of the gravity. This means the escape velocity, given by [Ve=(2GM/r)^1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity) , on Venus is substantially more than on Mars. Thus lighter molecules can more readily escape Mars than they can Venus as it takes far less energy to reach said velocities (10.4km/s on Venus, and 5.0km/s on Mars)^[1](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/)

The other contributing factor is large and small scale volcanism on Venus. There is much that is unknown, and debated, when it comes to volcanism on Venus; however, it is believed that the entire planet undergoes massive magmatic episodes every 500 million years or so, resurfacing Venus in its entirety. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Climate change is expected to modify ecological responses in the ocean, with the potential for important effects on the ecosystem services provided to humankind. Here we address the question of how rapidly multiple drivers of marine ecosystem change develop in the future ocean. By analysing an ensemble of models we find that, within the next 15 years, the climate change-driven trends in multiple ecosystem drivers emerge from the background of natural variability in 55% of the ocean and propagate rapidly to encompass 86% of the ocean by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario. However, we also demonstrate that the exposure of marine ecosystems to climate change-induced stress can be drastically reduced via climate mitigation measures; with mitigation, the proportion of ocean susceptible to multiple drivers within the next 15 years is reduced to 34%. Mitigation slows the pace at which multiple drivers emerge, allowing an additional 20 years for adaptation in marine ecological and socio-economic systems alike. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Aerosolized microorganisms may play an important role in climate change, disease transmission, water and soil contaminants, and geographic migration of microbes. While it is known that bioaerosols are generated when bubbles break on the surface of water containing microbes, it is largely unclear how viable soil-based microbes are transferred to the atmosphere. Here we report a previously unknown mechanism by which rain disperses soil bacteria into the air. Bubbles, tens of micrometres in size, formed inside the raindrops disperse micro-droplets containing soil bacteria during raindrop impingement. A single raindrop can transfer 0.01% of bacteria on the soil surface and the bacteria can survive more than one hour after the aerosol generation process. This work further reveals that bacteria transfer by rain is highly dependent on the regional soil profile and climate conditions.

	<TEXT> Let's say that we have a system of three boxes: X,Y,Z, and now let's use the 2^nd law of thermodynamics as an analog (which states that entropy either goes up, or remains constant). Therefore, If I put more energy into box X, the entire energy of the entire system must also increase or boxes Y and Z must decrease to remain constant. 

Analogously, we can think of the Earth as having different components that make up its climate system. Humans have very clearly continued to increase the amount of energy being dumped into the climate system, so (a) what should we expect, and (b) what do we see? We should expect to see that energy somewhere in the system, if we're not seeing it in surface and atmospheric temperatures, where is it? What the data shows is while box Y (surface temps.) and Z (tropospheric temps) saw no significant increase, the other box, box X (the oceans) continues to see an increase in the amount of energy it is absorbing: http://i.imgur.com/z5t04qT.jpg

So, when contrarians argue that the 'hiatus' shows a pause in global warming, they are incorrect as they are not account for the entire system, but rather they are looking at a select component. This is a fallacy better known as the [Fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition):

The fallacy of composition arises when one infers that something is true of the *whole* from the fact that it is true of some *part* of the whole

In short then, /u/Bowgentle is entirely correct. It does 'nada' to the 'man-made climate change argument' as /u/ImBoredLetsDebate asked. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The terrestrial water and carbon cycles are coupled through plant regulation of stomatal closure. Both soil moisture and vapour pressure deficitthe amount of moisture in the air relative to its potential maximumcan govern stomatal closure, which reduces plant carbon uptake. However, plants vary in the degree to which they regulate their stomataand in association, xylem conductancein response to increasing aridity: isohydric plants exert tight regulation of stomata and the water content of the plant, whereas anisohydric plants do not. Here we use remote-sensing data sets of anisohydricity and vegetation greenness to show that productivity in United States grasslandsespecially anisohydric onesis far more sensitive to variations in vapour pressure deficit than to variations in precipitation. Anisohydric ecosystem productivity is over three times more sensitive to vapour pressure deficit than isohydric ecosystem productivity. The precipitation sensitivity of summer productivity increases with anisohydricity only for the most anisohydric ecosystems. We conclude that increases in vapour pressure deficit rather than changes in precipitationboth of which are expected impacts of climate changewill be a dominant influence on future grassland productivity. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

It is commonly expected that the world's lowest income countries will face some of the worst impacts of global warming, despite contributing the least to greenhouse gas emissions. Using global atmospheric reanalyses we show that the world's lowest income countries are already experiencing greater increases in the occurrence of temperature extremes compared to the highest income countries, and have been for over two decades. Not only are low income countries less able to support mitigation and adaptation efforts, but their typically equatorial location predisposes them to lower natural temperature variability and thus greater changes in the occurrence of temperature extremes with global warming. This aspect of global warming is well known but overlooked in current international climate policy agreements and we argue that it is an important factor in reducing inequity due to climate impacts. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

To improve Greenland Ice Sheet surface mass balance (SMB) simulation, the subsurface scheme of the HIRHAM5 regional climate model was extended to include snow densification, varying hydraulic conductivity, irreducible water saturation and other effects on snow liquid water percolation and retention. Sensitivity experiments to investigate the effects of the additions and the impact of different parameterization choices are presented. Compared with 68 accumulation area ice cores, the simulated mean annual net accumulation bias is 5% (correlation coefficient of 0.90). Modeled SMB in the ablation area compares favorably with 1041 PROMICE observations with regression slope of 0.950.97 (depending on model configuration), correlation coefficient of 0.750.86 and mean bias 3%. Weighting ablation area SMB biases at low- and high-elevation with the amount of runoff from these areas, we estimate ice sheet-wide mass loss biases in the ablation area at 5 and 7% using observed (MODIS-derived) and internally calculated albedo, respectively. Comparison with observed melt day counts shows that patterns of spatial (correlation ~0.9) and temporal (correlation coefficient of ~0.9) variability are realistically represented in the simulations. However, the model tends to underestimate the magnitude of inter-annual variability (regression slope ~0.7) and overestimate that of spatial variability (slope ~1.2). In terms of subsurface temperature structure and occurrence of perennial firn aquifers and perched ice layers, the most important model choices are the albedo implementation and irreducible water saturation parameterization. At one percolation area location, for instance, the internally calculated albedo yields too high subsurface temperatures below 5 m, but when using an implementation of irreducible saturation allowing higher values, an ice layer forms in 2011, reducing the deep warm bias in subsequent years. On the other hand, prior to the formation of the ice layer, observed albedos combined with lower irreducible saturation give the smallest bias. Perennial firn aquifers and perched ice layers occur in varying thickness and area for different model parameter choices. While the occurrence of these features has an influence on the local-scale subsurface temperature, snow, ice and water fields, the Greenland-wide runoff and SMB arein the model's current climatedominated by the albedo implementation. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

It is commonly expected that the world's lowest income countries will face some of the worst impacts of global warming, despite contributing the least to greenhouse gas emissions. Using global atmospheric reanalyses we show that the world's lowest income countries are already experiencing greater increases in the occurrence of temperature extremes compared to the highest income countries, and have been for over two decades. Not only are low income countries less able to support mitigation and adaptation efforts, but their typically equatorial location predisposes them to lower natural temperature variability and thus greater changes in the occurrence of temperature extremes with global warming. This aspect of global warming is well known but overlooked in current international climate policy agreements and we argue that it is an important factor in reducing inequity due to climate impacts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Atmospheric footprint of the recent warming slowdown](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep40947)
___

**Abstract**

Growing body of literature has developed to detect the role of ocean heat uptake and transport in the recent warming slowdown between 19982013; however, the atmospheric footprint of the slowdown in dynamical and physical processes remains unclear. Here, we divided recent decades into the recent hiatus period and the preceding warming period (19831998) to investigate the atmospheric footprint. We use a process-resolving analysis method to quantify the contributions of different processes to the total temperature changes. We show that the increasing rate of global mean tropospheric temperature was also reduced during the hiatus period. The decomposed trends due to physical processes, including surface albedo, water vapour, cloud, surface turbulent fluxes and atmospheric dynamics, reversed the patterns between the two periods. The changes in atmospheric heat transport are coupled with changes in the surface latent heat flux across the lower troposphere (below approximately 800 hPa) and with cloud-related processes in the upper troposphere (above approximately 600 hPa) and were underpinned by strengthening/weakening Hadley Circulation and Walker Circulation during the warming/hiatus period. This dynamical coupling experienced a phase transition between the two periods, reminding us of the importance of understanding the atmospheric footprint, which constitutes an essential part of internal climate variability. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the IPCC's AR5 they calculate the mode [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity) to be 3C  1.5, which is a slightly lower estimated than that which was suggested in their AR4 (2C to 4.5C with best estimated of 3C). A number of 'skeptics' and/or 'lukewarmers' have suggested that ECS should be even lower (this is essentially *why* they are 'lukewarmers'); however, those studies on which their claims rest heavily rely on the more recent instrumental data which are likely biased towards the low end (for example, as a result of the so-called, 'hiatus' a period of time which saw reduced rate of warming in the surface records). A number of studies, including this one, strongly suggest that ECS shows a positive feedback temperature dependence^[1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064240/abstract) . How will the IPCC's AR6 reflect this, if at all? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This particular statement stands out to me, as a number of studies have recently suggested the following in regard to ECS:

*Based on optimal interpolation on the proxy records and by taking area-weighted means, we find that global tropical mean SSTs increased by 2.7C across the PETM and that the global mean SSTs increased by 5.3C, very close to previous estimates, but our estimate avoids the use of an intervening climate model. CESM1 has a modern equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.2C per doubling of CO2, and we find a similar response of 3.5C for a doubling under Eocene conditions in our simulations. However, the global mean SST change is only 2.8C per doubling, indicating that the 3.5C global response reflects enhanced warming on land. Thus, a model with this sensitivity would require nearly two further doublings of CO2 (or equivalent forcing) to achieve a global mean SST increase of 5.3C, as implied by the data. The required carbon release would then be 10,000 gigametric tons (Gt) of carbon, which is in keeping with budgets from other climate models. These large carbon inputs and resulting CO2 values are unlikely and not supported by recent pCO2 (partial pressure of CO2) estimates. Hence, the most likely explanation is that the latest Paleocene equilibrium climate sensitivity was significantly larger than the models 3.2C, perhaps due to strongly increased sensitivity at higher temperature during the PETM, or non-CO2 changes in radiative balance were of importance in maintaining latest Paleocene warmth and enhancing PETM warming.*

I'd be curious to know how, if at all, the IPCC will adjust its ECS boundaries in its upcoming assessment report. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Global ocean temperatures rapidly warmed by ~5C during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~56 million years ago). Extratropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) met or exceeded modern subtropical values. With these warm extratropical temperatures, climate models predict tropical SSTs 35Cnear upper physiological temperature limits for many organisms. However, few data are available to test these projected extreme tropical temperatures or their potential lethality. We identify the PETM in a shallow marine sedimentary section deposited in Nigeria. On the basis of planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and oxygen isotope ratios and the molecular proxy TEX86, latest Paleocene equatorial SSTs were ~33C, and TEX86 indicates that SSTs rose to 36C during the PETM. This confirms model predictions on the magnitude of polar amplification and refutes the tropical thermostat theory. We attribute a massive drop in dinoflagellate abundance and diversity at peak warmth to thermal stress, showing that the base of tropical food webs is vulnerable to rapid warming. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) populated Siberia, Beringia, and North America during the Pleistocene and early Holocene. Recent breakthroughs in ancient DNA sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two specimens of woolly mammoths (Palkopoulou et al. 2015). One mammoth specimen is from a mainland population 45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful. The second, a 4300 yr old specimen, is derived from an isolated population on Wrangel island where mammoths subsisted with small effective population size more than 43-fold lower than previous populations. These extreme differences in effective population size offer a rare opportunity to test nearly neutral models of genome architecture evolution within a single species. Using these previously published mammoth sequences, we identify deletions, retrogenes, and non-functionalizing point mutations. In the Wrangel island mammoth, we identify a greater number of deletions, a larger proportion of deletions affecting gene sequences, a greater number of candidate retrogenes, and an increased number of premature stop codons. This accumulation of detrimental mutations is consistent with genomic meltdown in response to low effective population sizes in the dwindling mammoth population on Wrangel island. In addition, we observe high rates of loss of olfactory receptors and urinary proteins, either because these loci are non-essential or because they were favored by divergent selective pressures in island environments. Finally, at the locus of FOXQ1 we observe two independent loss-of-function mutations, which would confer a satin coat phenotype in this island woolly mammoth. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Ice-marginal glaciated landscapes demarcate former boundaries of the continental ice sheets. Throughout circumpolar regions, permafrost has preserved relict ground ice and glacigenic sediments, delaying the sequence of postglacial landscape change that transformed temperate environments millennia earlier. Here we show that within 7  10^6 km^2 of glaciated permafrost terrain, extensive landscapes remain poised for major climate-driven change. Across northwestern Canada, 60100-km-wide concentric swaths of thaw slumpaffected terrain delineate the maximum and recessional positions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. These landscapes comprise 17% of continuous permafrost terrain in a 1.27  10^6 km^2 study area, indicating widespread preservation of late Pleistocene ground ice. These thaw slump, relict ground ice, and glacigenic terrain associations are also evident at the circumpolar scale. Recent intensification of thaw slumping across northwestern Canada has mobilized primary glacial sediments, triggering a cascade of fluvial, lacustrine, and coastal effects. These geologically significant processes, highlighted by the spatial distribution of thaw slumps and patterns of fluvial sediment mobilization, signal the climate-driven renewal of deglaciation and postglacial permafrost landscape evolution.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Increase in acidifying water in the western Arctic Ocean](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3228.html)
___

**Abstract**

The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean decreases seawater pH and carbonate mineral aragonite saturation state (arag), a process known as Ocean Acidification (OA). This can be detrimental to marine organisms and ecosystems. The Arctic Ocean is particularly sensitive to climate change and aragonite is expected to become undersaturated (arag  1) there sooner than in other oceans. However, the extent and expansion rate of OA in this region are still unknown. Here we show that, between the 1990s and 2010, low arag waters have expanded northwards at least 5, to 85 N, and deepened 100 m, to 250 m depth. Data from trans-western Arctic Ocean cruises show that arag  1 water has increased in the upper 250 m from 5% to 31% of the total area north of 70 N. Tracer data and model simulations suggest that increased Pacific Winter Water transport, driven by an anomalous circulation pattern and sea-ice retreat, is primarily responsible for the expansion, although local carbon recycling and anthropogenic CO2 uptake have also contributed. These results indicate more rapid acidification is occurring in the Arctic Ocean than the Pacific and Atlantic oceans with the western Arctic Ocean the first open-ocean region with large-scale expansion of acidified water directly observed in the upper water column. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Increase in acidifying water in the western Arctic Ocean](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3228.html)
___

**Abstract**

The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean decreases seawater pH and carbonate mineral aragonite saturation state (arag), a process known as Ocean Acidification (OA). This can be detrimental to marine organisms and ecosystems. The Arctic Ocean is particularly sensitive to climate change and aragonite is expected to become undersaturated (arag  1) there sooner than in other oceans. However, the extent and expansion rate of OA in this region are still unknown. Here we show that, between the 1990s and 2010, low arag waters have expanded northwards at least 5, to 85 N, and deepened 100m, to 250m depth. Data from trans-western Arctic Ocean cruises show that arag  1 water has increased in the upper 250m from 5% to 31% of the total area north of 70 N. Tracer data and model simulations suggest that increased Pacific Winter Water transport, driven by an anomalous circulation pattern and sea-ice retreat, is primarily responsible for the expansion, although local carbon recycling and anthropogenic CO2 uptake have also contributed. These results indicate more rapid acidification is occurring in the Arctic Ocean than the Pacific and Atlantic oceans with the western Arctic Ocean the first open-ocean region with large-scale expansion of acidified water directly observed in the upper water column. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Updated observational datasets without climatological infilling show that there was an increase in sea ice concentration in the Eastern Arctic between 1950 and 1975, contrary to earlier climatology in-filled observational datasets that show weak inter-annual variations during that time period. We here present climate model simulations showing that this observed sea ice concentration increase was primarily a consequence of cooling induced by increasing anthropogenic aerosols and natural forcing. Indeed, sulphur dioxide emissions, which lead to the formation of sulphate aerosols, peaked around 1980 causing a sharp increase in the burden of sulphate between the 1950s and 1970s; but since 1980, the burden has dropped. Our climate model simulations show that the cooling contribution of aerosols offset the warming effect of increasing greenhouse gases over the mid-twentieth century resulting in the expansion of the Arctic sea ice cover. These results challenge the perception that Arctic sea ice extent was unperturbed by human influence until the 1970s, suggesting instead that it exhibited earlier forced multi-decadal variations, with implications for our understanding of impacts and adaptation in human and natural Arctic systems. </TEXT>

[Summary](http://energy.anu.edu.au/files/Summary%20-%20100%25%20renewable%20electricity%20in%20Australia.pdf) (pdf)
___

**Abstract**

We present an energy balance analysis of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in a 100% 
renewable energy scenario
 in which wind and photovoltaics (PV) provides 90% of the annual electricity
. 
The key outcome 
of our modelling 
is that the 
additional 
cost of balancing renewable 
energy
 supply
 with
demand 
on an hourly basis 
throughout the year is modest: AU$25
-30/MWh
 (US$19-
23/MWh)
.

In our modelling we avoid heroic assumptions about future technology development
 by only including 
technology that has already been deployed in large quantities ( 100 Gigawatts), namely PV, wind, high 
voltage 
transmission
 (HVDC, HVAC) and pumped hydro energy storage (PHES). 
PHES constitutes 97% of 
worldwide
 electricity storage but is neglected in many
 analyses.

In our scenarios wind and PV contributes about 9
0% of annual electricity, while existing hydroelectricity 
and biomass contributes about 10%. We use historical data for wind, sun and demand for every hour of 
the years 2006
-10.
 Very wide distribution of PV and wind reduces supply shortfalls by taking advantage 
of different weather systems.
 Energy balance between supply and demand is maintained by adding 
sufficient PHES, HVDC/HVAC and excess wind and PV capacity. We term the cost of these additions
 as 
the levelised cost of balancing (LCOB).
 LCOB plus
 the levelised cost of 
annual 
generation (LCOG), combine 
to give the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE).

Using 2016 prices prevailing in Australia, we estimate that LCOB is AU
$28
/MWh, 
LCOG is AU
$65/MWh 
and LCOE is 
AU
$93/MWh
.  This can be compared with the estimated LCOE from a new supercritical black 
coal power station in Australia of
 AU
$80/MWh
. Much of Australias coal power stations will need to be 
replaced over the next 15 years. LCOE 
of renewables 
is almost certain to decrease due to rapidly falling 
cost of wind and PV. With PV and wind in the price range of AU
$50/MWh, the LCOE of a balanced 100% 
renewable electricity system is around AU
$75/MWh.

Importantly, the LCOB calculated in this work is an upper bound
  we use 2016 prices and do not include 
demand management or
 batteries
. A large fraction of LCOB relates to periods of several successive days 
of overcast and windless weather that occur once every few years. Substantial reductions in LCOB are 
possible through contractual load shedding, the occasional use of legacy 
coal and g
as generators to 
charge 
PHES reservoirs, and management of the charging times of batteries in electric cars.
Although we have not modelled dynamical stability on a time scale of 
sub
-seconds to minutes we note 
that PHES can provide excellent inertial energy, spinning reserve, rapid start, black start capability, 
voltage regulation and frequency control. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Shallow landslides, triggered by extreme rainfall, are a significant hazard in mountainous landscapes. The hazard posed by shallow landslides depends on the availability and strength of colluvial material in landslide source areas and the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events. Here we investigate how the time taken to accumulate colluvium affects landslide triggering rate in the Southern Appalachian Mountains, USA and how this may affect future landslide hazards. We calculated the failure potential of 283 hollows by comparing colluvium depths to the minimum (critical) soil depth required for landslide initiation in each hollow. Our data show that most hollow soil depths are close to their critical depth, with 62% of hollows having soils that are too thin to fail. Our results, supported by numerical modeling, reveal that landslide frequency in many humid landscapes may be insensitive to projected changes in the frequency of intense rainfall events. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.

**Abstract**

Climate change has been shown to impact the mean climate state and climate extremes. Though climate extremes have the potential to disrupt society, extreme conditions are rare by definition. In contrast, mild weather occurs frequently and many human activities are built around it. We provide a global analysis of mild weather based on simple criteria and explore changes in response to radiative forcing. We find a slight global mean decrease in the annual number of mild days projected both in the near future (4 days per year, 20162035) and at the end of this century (10 days per year, 20812100). Projected seasonal and regional redistributions of mild days are substantially greater. These changes are larger than the interannual variability of mild weather caused by El NioSouthern Oscillation. Finally, we show an observed global decrease in the recent past, and that observed regional changes in mild weather resemble projections. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's an important point to consider, however, due to relevant time scales. For example, if it takes ~30 years for a tree to reach maturity, you need to ask yourself how many trees can you burn during those three decades, what fraction is left behind as waste, and note that the underlying assumption suggesting that the carbon sink will recover by 100% through forest management, likely doesn't hold in all cases. This concept can be termed the "carbon payback period."

As the report states:

The many attempts that have been made to estimate carbon payback periods suggest that they vary substantially, from less than 20 years to many decades, and in some cases even centuries... It can be argued that the length of the carbon payback period does not matter as long as all emissions are eventually absorbed. This ignores, however, the potential impact in the short term on climate tipping points (a concept that is not yet proven but for which there is some evidence) and on the worlds ability to meet the 1.5C target set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which requires greenhouse gas emissions to peak in the near term.  

Nothing is perfect, so it's important to study where such deficiencies reside in order to better manage these possible short comings. For example, noting the aforementioned, the study goes on to discuss accounting for biomass in policy:

...a tonne of emissions from burning biomass for energy does not count against a countrys emissions target but a tonne of emissions from fossil fuel energy sources does.

Quite clearly then, while there is an incentive to use biomass energy rather than fossil fuels in order to reduce a countrys greenhouse gas emissions, such a reduction is not necessarily real, as the emissions are still there, they just haven't been accounted for.

___

**Abstract**

Human activities drive environmental changes at scales that could potentially cause ecosystem collapses in the marine environment. We combined information on marine biodiversity with spatial assessments of the impacts of climate change to identify the key areas to prioritize for the conservation of global marine biodiversity. This process identified six marine regions of exceptional biodiversity based on global distributions of 1729 species of fish, 124 marine mammals, and 330 seabirds. Overall, these hot spots of marine biodiversity coincide with areas most severely affected by global warming. In particular, these marine biodiversity hot spots have undergone local to regional increasing water temperatures, slowing current circulation, and decreasing primary productivity. Furthermore, when we overlapped these hot spots with available industrial fishery data, albeit coarser than our estimates of climate impacts, they suggest a worrying coincidence whereby the worlds richest areas for marine biodiversity are also those areas mostly affected by both climate change and industrial fishing. In light of these findings, we offer an adaptable framework for determining local to regional areas of special concern for the conservation of marine biodiversity. This has exposed the need for finer-scaled fishery data to assist in the management of global fisheries if the accumulative, but potentially preventable, effect of fishing on climate change impacts is to be minimized within areas prioritized for marine biodiversity conservation. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The pacing of glacialinterglacial cycles during the Quaternary period (the past 2.6 million years) is attributed to astronomically driven changes in high-latitude insolation. However, it has not been clear how astronomical forcing translates into the observed sequence of interglacials. Here we show that before one million years ago interglacials occurred when the energy related to summer insolation exceeded a simple threshold, about every 41,000 years. Over the past one million years, fewer of these insolation peaks resulted in deglaciation (that is, more insolation peaks were skipped), implying that the energy threshold for deglaciation had risen, which led to longer glacials. However, as a glacial lengthens, the energy needed for deglaciation decreases. A statistical model that combines these observations correctly predicts every complete deglaciation of the past million years and shows that the sequence of interglacials that has occurred is one of a small set of possibilities. The model accounts for the dominance of obliquity-paced glacialinterglacial cycles early in the Quaternary and for the change in their frequency about one million years ago. We propose that the appearance of larger ice sheets over the past million years was a consequence of an increase in the deglaciation threshold and in the number of skipped insolation peaks. </TEXT>

The existing empirical literature on the impacts of climate change on the electricity sector has focused on changing electricity consumption patterns. In this paper, we show that incorporating impacts on the frequency and intensity of peak load consumption during hot days implies sizable required investments in peak generating capacity (or major advances in storage technology or the structure of electricity prices), which results in substantially larger impacts than those from just changes in overall consumption.

**Abstract**

It has been suggested that climate change impacts on the electric sector will account for the majority of global economic damages by the end of the current century and beyond [Rose S, et al. (2014) Understanding the Social Cost of Carbon: A Technical Assessment]. The empirical literature has shown significant increases in climate-driven impacts on overall consumption, yet has not focused on the cost implications of the increased intensity and frequency of extreme events driving peak demand, which is the highest load observed in a period. We use comprehensive, high-frequency data at the level of load balancing authorities to parameterize the relationship between average or peak electricity demand and temperature for a major economy. Using statistical models, we analyze multiyear data from 166 load balancing authorities in the United States. We couple the estimated temperature response functions for total daily consumption and daily peak load with 18 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) to simulate climate change-driven impacts on both outcomes. We show moderate and heterogeneous changes in consumption, with an average increase of 2.8% by end of century. The results of our peak load simulations, however, suggest significant increases in the intensity and frequency of peak events throughout the United States, assuming todays technology and electricity market fundamentals. As the electricity grid is built to endure maximum load, our findings have significant implications for the construction of costly peak generating capacity, suggesting additional peak capacity costs of up to 180 billion dollars by the end of the century under business-as-usual. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Climate-driven thaw of permafrost preserved glacial landscapes, northwestern Canada](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2017/02/06/G38626.1)
___

**Abstract**

Ice-marginal glaciated landscapes demarcate former boundaries of the continental ice sheets. Throughout circumpolar regions, permafrost has preserved relict ground ice and glacigenic sediments, delaying the sequence of postglacial landscape change that transformed temperate environments millennia earlier. Here we show that within 7  10^6 km^2 of glaciated permafrost terrain, extensive landscapes remain poised for major climate-driven change. Across northwestern Canada, 60100-km-wide concentric swaths of thaw slumpaffected terrain delineate the maximum and recessional positions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. These landscapes comprise 17% of continuous permafrost terrain in a 1.27  10^6 km^2 study area, indicating widespread preservation of late Pleistocene ground ice. These thaw slump, relict ground ice, and glacigenic terrain associations are also evident at the circumpolar scale. Recent intensification of thaw slumping across northwestern Canada has mobilized primary glacial sediments, triggering a cascade of fluvial, lacustrine, and coastal effects. These geologically significant processes, highlighted by the spatial distribution of thaw slumps and patterns of fluvial sediment mobilization, signal the climate-driven renewal of deglaciation and postglacial permafrost landscape evolution.  </TEXT>

___

**Significance** 

The Human System has become strongly dominant within the Earth System in many different ways. However, in current models that explore the future of humanity and environment, and guide policy, key Human System variables, such as demographics, inequality, economic growth, and migration, are not coupled with the Earth System but are instead driven by exogenous estimates such as United Nations (UN) population projections. This makes the models likely to miss important feedbacks in the real EarthHuman system that may result in unexpected outcomes requiring very different policy interventions. The importance of humanity's sustainability challenges calls for collaboration of natural and social scientists to develop coupled EarthHuman system models for devising effective science-based policies and measures.

**Abstract**

Over the last two centuries, the impact of the Human System has grown dramatically, becoming strongly dominant within the Earth System in many different ways. Consumption, inequality, and population have increased extremely fast, especially since about 1950, threatening to overwhelm the many critical functions and ecosystems of the Earth System. Changes in the Earth System, in turn, have important feedback effects on the Human System, with costly and potentially serious consequences. However, current models do not incorporate these critical feedbacks. We argue that in order to understand the dynamics of either system, Earth System Models must be coupled with Human System Models through bidirectional couplings representing the positive, negative, and delayed feedbacks that exist in the real systems. In particular, key Human System variables, such as demographics, inequality, economic growth, and migration, are not coupled with the Earth System but are instead driven by exogenous estimates, such as United Nations population projections. This makes current models likely to miss important feedbacks in the real EarthHuman system, especially those that may result in unexpected or counterintuitive outcomes, and thus requiring different policy interventions from current models. The importance and imminence of sustainability challenges, the dominant role of the Human System in the Earth System, and the essential roles the Earth System plays for the Human System, all call for collaboration of natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers in multidisciplinary research and modeling to develop coupled EarthHuman system models for devising effective science-based policies and measures to benefit current and future generations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Palaeoclimate science: Pulsating ice sheet](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/full/542298a.html)
____

During the last ice age, huge numbers of icebergs were episodically discharged from an ice sheet that covered North America. Numerical modelling suggests that these events resulted from a conceptually simple feedback cycle.

Understanding abrupt changes in ice sheets and climate is a long-standing issue in palaeoclimate science. In the last glacial period, North America's Laurentide Ice Sheet episodically discharged large armadas of icebergs through the Hudson Strait into the North Atlantic. This expulsion of fresh water in the form of icebergs not only raised the global sea level by a few metres, but also weakened ocean circulation in the North Atlantic and therefore affected climate. The cause of these 'Heinrich events' remains hotly debated. Bassis et al. use an ice-sheet model to demonstrate that such events could have been triggered by relatively small fluctuations in subsurface ocean temperature  a result that has implications for the survival of present-day ice sheets.

Evidence for Heinrich events is found as distinct layers of coarse glacial debris in ocean-sediment records. Such particles were incorporated at the base of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and were then transported with the discharged icebergs into the North Atlantic. After the icebergs melted, these particles accumulated on the ocean floor.

Heinrich events occurred every few thousand years during the glacial periods, but their interval and intensity varied. Interestingly, the timing of these events coincides with cold phases of DansgaardOeschger (DO) cycles  millennium-scale climate oscillations recorded in ice cores drilled in Greenland. Rapid ice-sheet decay during cold periods seems surprising, given present-day observations of warming and rapid glacier retreat in Greenland.

In the 1990s, a 'bingepurge' mechanism6 was proposed to explain Heinrich events. In this explanation, the Laurentide Ice Sheet slowly increased in mass by gradually accumulating ice (the 'binge' phase). When the ice was sufficiently thick, the base of the ice sheet reached its melting point. The subglacial sediment acted as a lubricant, causing the ice sheet to slide, become unstable and discharge icebergs at an enhanced rate (the 'purge' phase). Although this mechanism does not require the involvement of external factors such as climate change, it cannot explain the synchronization between Heinrich events and DO cycles.

Other explanations assume that a large, protruding ice shelf, situated between Canada and the southern tip of Greenland, buttressed the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Subsurface ocean warming during the cold phases of DO cycles, as revealed by proxy data, could then have melted and destabilized the ice shelf, triggering Heinrich events. However, the existence of a large ice shelf is incompatible with evidence of a mostly open ocean during the last glacial period. Moreover, the models that describe the ice-shelf collapse are poorly constrained.

Bassis and colleagues consider an alternative mechanism in which pulses of subsurface ocean warming act as an external trigger, but the existence of a large ice shelf is not required. The Laurentide Ice Sheet starts at its full extent, depressing the sill  a raised frontal section of the glacier bed  at the mouth of the Hudson Strait. A pulse of subsurface ocean warming of a few degrees then enhances iceberg calving. Because the glacier bed deepens upstream, this causes an unstable, rapid ice-sheet retreat in the form of a Heinrich event. The glacier bed gradually adjusts to the ice sheet's decreasing mass by rising,which reduces iceberg calving and elevates the sill, cutting off contact with the warm subsurface water. The ice sheet can then slowly advance to its full extent and the entire process is repeated, giving rise to a pulsating ice sheet.

The authors simulate Heinrich events generated by this mechanism using a numerical ice-sheet model. They find that their results are fully consistent with the observational record, in both timing and magnitude. Crucially, their events occur only for the ocean-warming pulses for which Heinrich events are actually observed. This implies that full ice-sheet recovery and subsequent depression of the sill are prerequisites for ocean warming to trigger a Heinrich event, and also control the interval between events.

A strength of the authors' model is that it is quantitative, physically based and includes the dominant dynamic processes and feedbacks expected for such ice sheets. Furthermore, although the model is simple, it is robust against a wide choice of model parameters. Nevertheless, future studies should certainly explore more-sophisticated models.

Bassis and colleagues' proposed mechanism relies on subsurface ocean warming, which is the factor that seems to drive today's dynamic mass loss from ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. However, it is not known to what extent glacier-bed adjustment preconditioned today's ice sheets for abrupt retreat. Bassis et al. focus on explaining Heinrich events and do not resolve the cause of ocean warming. Nor do the authors consider how freshwater flux from Heinrich events affects the global climate system. Answering these enigmatic questions in palaeoclimate science and understanding Heinrich events in the context of DO cycles would require the proposed mechanism to be integrated into coupled atmosphereocean-circulation models.

The authors' work is a reminder of the complexity and nonlinearity of ice-sheetclimate systems, showing how small perturbations can trigger extreme responses through feedback mechanisms. This is relevant for understanding the palaeoclimate, as well as for discussions on global warming, rapid ice-sheet retreat and future sea-level rise. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Droughts have had large impacts on past and present societies. High-resolution paleoclimate data are essential to place recent droughts in a meaningful historical context and to predict regional future changes with greater accuracy. Such records, however, are very scarce in the Middle East in general, and the Fertile Crescent in particular. Here we present a 2400 year long speleothem-based multiproxy record from Gejkar Cave in northern Iraq. Oxygen and carbon isotopes and magnesium are faithful recorders of effective moisture. The new Gejkar record not only shows that droughts in 19982000 and 20072010, which have been argued to be a contributing factor to Syrian civil war, were extreme compared to the current mean climate, but they were also superimposed on a long-term aridification trend that already started around or before 950 C.E. (Common Era). This long-term trend is not captured by tree ring records and climate models, emphasizing the importance of using various paleoclimate proxy data to evaluate and improve climate models and to correctly inform policy makers about future hydroclimatic changes in this drought-prone region. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The effect of forcing wind resolution on the extremes of global wind-wave climate are investigated in numerical simulations. Forcing winds from the Community Atmosphere Model at horizontal resolutions of 1.0 and 0.25 are used to drive Wavewatch III. Differences in extreme wave height are found to manifest most strongly in tropical cyclone (TC) regions, emphasizing the need for high-resolution forcing in those areas. Comparison with observations typically show improvement in performance with increased forcing resolution, with a strong influence in the tail of the distribution, although simulated extremes can exceed observations. A simulation for the end of the 21st century under a RCP 8.5 type emission scenario suggests further increases in extreme wave height in TC regions. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Observations over the 20th century evidence no long-term warming in the subpolar North Atlantic (SPG). This region even experienced a rapid cooling around 1970, raising a debate over its potential reoccurrence. Here we assess the risk of future abrupt SPG cooling in 40 climate models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Contrary to the long-term SPG warming trend evidenced by most of the models, 17.5% of the models (7/40) project a rapid SPG cooling, consistent with a collapse of the local deep-ocean convection. Uncertainty in projections is associated with the models varying capability in simulating the present-day SPG stratification, whose realistic reproduction appears a necessary condition for the onset of a convection collapse. This event occurs in 45.5% of the 11 models best able to simulate the observed SPG stratification. Thus, due to systematic model biases, the CMIP5 ensemble as a whole underestimates the chance of future abrupt SPG cooling, entailing crucial implications for observation and adaptation policy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Context is important here, so while I would suggest placing emphasis on the worst case scenario in some cases related to climate change, there are others that I would not for at least two reasons: 

(1) All the evidence points elsewhere. While it's important to consider these hypothesis and theories there has to be some evidence to support them if they're going to drive policy. In each of the scenarios outlined in the study, that evidence simply isn't robust, it's just not there; and, in my opinion decisions ought to be evidence based - not the contrary.

(2) Pragmatism. Regulation and policies have social and economic consequences. As an example, there is some degree of uncertainty regarding the equilibrium climate sensitivity value ([ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity)). The current consensus value is roughly 3C, however, the more widely accepted range of values is between 1.5C - 4.5C with some estimates being exceptionally high - upwards of nearly 12C. The ECS tells us how much warming occurs for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. This is important, because it sets the stage for emissions targets (for example the [Paris Agreement](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php)). Decarbonization efforts based on policy and regulations underlined by an estimated ECS value of 1.5C could therefore result in too little too late, should the actual value be 3C. Meanwhile, rapid decarbonization efforts based on policy and regulations underlined by the worst case scenario estimates of an ECS value upwards of 12C would result in social and economic catastrophe. The transition to decarbonization must be made as is quickly as can be done within reason.

Hopefully the above has highlighted why it's not always in the best interest to place emphasis on worst case scenarios, especially when they are not supported by strong evidence. Peoples lives will be impacted no matter the decision made, so it's important to reduce the negative impacts of those decisions, and the only way to do that is to ensure that those decisions, those regulations and policies, are based on the best available evidence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think I can properly address that question, I can only speculate about dissolved oxygen (DO). I'm not a biologist, but I would infer that more oxygen - though certainly to have *some* drawbacks - grossly speaking, would likely be more beneficial up to a certain limit.

As the worlds oceans and atmosphere are coupled to a good degree it may be beneficial to look for analogs during the late Palaeozoic, when atmospheric O2 may have been as high as ([35%](http://i.imgur.com/Nq0GEvK.jpg))^[1](http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/31/1/60) (in comparison, today's atmosphere is 21% O2). It's a rather large topic but I would recommend the following review paper with plenty of references to look into as well: [Evolution of oxygen utilization in multicellular organisms and implications for cell signalling in tissue engineering](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258841/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lack of mixing can be attributed, in part, to a slowing ocean currents and has been noted by a number of studies^[1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7640/full/nature21068.html), ^[2](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n5/full/nclimate2554.html) . More specifically, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation appears to be slowing as a result of increasing meltwater from the Greenland Ice Sheet^[3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016PA003014/abstract), ^[4](https://www.hakaimagazine.com/article-short/greenland-ice-melt-could-push-atlantic-circulation-collapse) . This can be further noted by observation of the '[cold blob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_blob_(North_Atlantic)' in the North Atlantic. 

Furthermore, warming waters result in stratification which prevents mixing between layers. This is all introductory material and can readily found online^[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation). For example, I would refer you to YaleCourses on Youtube under 'Atmosphere, Ocean and Environmental Change with Ron Smith' (playlist?list=PL902AF247F4163F61)

EDIT: To answer your question regarding other attributes the authors state the following in the paper:

"**Ventilation, overturning and consumption**

From our current understanding of the oceans, the oxygen loss in the deep oceans can have four origins. (a) A reduction of ventilation in deep convection regions, which would provide less ventilated waters in high latitudes, and a reduction of mixed layer subduction, mainly in mid and high latitudes. (b) A slowdown of meridional overturning circulation, which would reduce the amount of oxygenated waters that are mixed with older waters and thus increase the age of the deep waters in general. (c) An increase in biological activity in the upper ocean, with increased remineralization and thus oxygen consumption at depth. (d) Natural multi-decadal variability that is not captured by the data currently available.

While we cannot assign the observed changes to a sole origin, some are more likely than others. Reduced ventilation by deep convection is going to have a slow impact, since the oxygen-reduced waters will have to advect throughout the global basins before affecting older water masses. A reduction in deep convection that happens now might be observed in the tropical oceans in 50100 years, assuming no impact on overturning transports by a reduced deep water convection. On the other hand, a reduction of meridional overturning circulation (MOC) will be observed globally instantaneously, since a reduction of MOC reduces the push of oxygenated waters into areas deprived of oxygen. The last cause for accelerated oxygen decrease at depth is an increased remineralization, caused by enhanced biological activity. This would increase oxygen consumption throughout the water column, though decreasing with depth, since the Martin curve decreases close to exponentially." </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Recent studies indicate that the glaciers and ice caps in Queen Elizabeth Islands (QEI), Canada have experienced an increase in ice mass loss during the last two decades, but the contribution of ice dynamics to this loss is not well known. We present a comprehensive mapping of ice velocity using a suite of satellite data from year 1991 to 2015, combined with ice thickness data from NASA Operation IceBridge, to calculate ice discharge. We find that ice discharge increased significantly after 2011 in Prince of Wales Icefield, maintained or decreased in other sectors, whereas glacier surges have little impact on long-term trends in ice discharge. During 19912005, the QEI mass loss averaged 6.3  1.1 Gt yr^1 , 52% from ice discharge and the rest from surface mass balance (SMB). During 20052014, the mass loss from ice discharge averaged 3.5  0.2 Gt yr^1 (10%) versus 29.6  3.0 Gt yr^1 (90%) from SMB. SMB processes therefore dominate the QEI mass balance, with ice dynamics playing a significant role only in a few basins. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

In winter through early summer of 20142015, temperatures in the western U.S. were substantially enhanced due to a persistent high pressure ridge and warm water in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Concurrently, monthly averaged maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) O3 in June 2015 was enhanced by 313ppb across a large portion of the western U.S. At the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (2.8km asl) in central Oregon, O3 in June 2015 was enhanced by 11 ppbv compared to the long-term mean. Some urban areas had many days in June 2015 with MDA8 values above the current air quality threshold of 70 ppbv. We show that the high O3 was associated with enhanced temperatures, reduced cloud fraction, increased stagnation, and increased biogenic emissions. The data in June 2015 show enhanced O3/temperature slopes at several sites, compared to previous June data, due to these multiple factors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Heinrich events triggered by ocean forcing and modulated by isostatic adjustment](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/full/nature21069.html)
___

**Abstract**

During the last glacial period, the Laurentide Ice Sheet sporadically discharged huge numbers of icebergs through the Hudson Strait into the North Atlantic Ocean, leaving behind distinct layers of ice-rafted debris in the ocean sediments. Perplexingly, these massive discharge eventsHeinrich eventsoccurred during the cold portion of millennial-scale climate oscillations called DansgaardOeschger cycles. This is in contrast to the expectation that ice sheets expand in colder climates and shrink in warmer climates. Here we use an ice sheet model to show that the magnitude and timing of Heinrich events can be explained by the same processes that drive the retreat of modern marine-terminating glaciers. In our model, subsurface ocean warming associated with variations in the overturning circulation increases underwater melt along the calving face, triggering rapid margin retreat and increased iceberg discharge. On millennial timescales, isostatic adjustment causes the bed to uplift, isolating the terminus from subsurface warming and allowing the ice sheet to advance again until, at its most advanced position, it is poised for another Heinrich event. This mechanism not only explains the timing and magnitude of observed Heinrich events, but also suggests that ice sheets in contact with warming oceans may be vulnerable to catastrophic collapse even with little atmospheric warming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Decline in global oceanic oxygen content during the past five decades](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/full/nature21399.html)
___

**Abstract**

Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep ocean. It is thought that such a decline in the oceanic oxygen content could affect ocean nutrient cycles and the marine habitat, with potentially detrimental consequences for fisheries and coastal economies. Regional observational data indicate a continuous decrease in oceanic dissolved oxygen concentrations in most regions of the global ocean, with an increase reported in a few limited areas, varying by study. Prior work attempting to resolve variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations at the global scale reported a global oxygen loss of 550  130 teramoles (1012 mol) per decade between 100 and 1,000 metres depth based on a comparison of data from the 1970s and 1990s. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of the entire ocean oxygen inventory by analysing dissolved oxygen and supporting data for the complete oceanic water column over the past 50 years. We find that the global oceanic oxygen content of 227.4  1.1 petamoles (1015 mol) has decreased by more than two per cent (4.8  2.1 petamoles) since 1960, with large variations in oxygen loss in different ocean basins and at different depths. We suggest that changes in the upper water column are mostly due to a warming-induced decrease in solubility and biological consumption. Changes in the deeper ocean may have their origin in basin-scale multi-decadal variability, oceanic overturning slow-down and a potential increase in biological consumption. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [The Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research Model (ICAR) ](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JHM-D-15-0155.1)
___

**Abstract**

With limited computational resources, there is a need for computationally frugal models. This is particularly the case for atmospheric sciences, which have long relied on either simplistic analytical solutions or computationally expensive numerical models. The simpler solutions are inadequate for many problems, while the cost of numerical models makes their use impossible for many problems, most notably high-resolution climate downscaling applications spanning large areas, long time periods, and many global climate projections. Here the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research model (ICAR) is presented to provide a new step along the modeling complexity continuum. ICAR leverages an analytical solution for high-resolution perturbations to wind velocities, in conjunction with numerical physics schemes, that is, advection and cloud microphysics, to simulate the atmosphere. The focus of the initial development of ICAR is for predictions of precipitation, and eventually temperature, humidity, and radiation at the land surface. Comparisons between ICAR and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model for simulations over an idealized mountain are presented, as well as among ICAR, WRF, and the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) observation-based product for a year-long simulation over the Colorado Rockies. In the ideal simulations, ICAR matches WRF precipitation predictions across a range of environmental conditions with a coefficient of determination r^2 of 0.92. In the Colorado Rockies, ICAR, WRF, and PRISM show very good agreement, with differences between ICAR and WRF comparable to the differences between WRF and PRISM in the cool season. For these simulations, WRF required 140800 times more computational resources than ICAR. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14202)
___

**Abstract**

Glaciers experienced worldwide retreat during the twentieth and early twenty first centuries, and the negative trend in global glacier mass balance since the early 1990s is predominantly a response to anthropogenic climate warming. The exceptional terminus advance of some glaciers during recent global warming is thought to relate to locally specific climate conditions, such as increased precipitation. In New Zealand, at least 58 glaciers advanced between 1983 and 2008, and Franz Josef and Fox glaciers advanced nearly continuously during this time. Here we show that the glacier advance phase resulted predominantly from discrete periods of reduced air temperature, rather than increased precipitation. The lower temperatures were associated with anomalous southerly winds and low sea surface temperature in the Tasman Sea region. These conditions result from variability in the structure of the extratropical atmospheric circulation over the South Pacific. While this sequence of climate variability and its effect on New Zealand glaciers is unusual on a global scale, it remains consistent with a climate system that is being modified by humans. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The dominant external forces influencing the rate of change of the Earth System have been astronomical and geophysical during the planets 4.5-billion-year existence. In the last six decades, anthropogenic forcings have driven exceptionally rapid rates of change in the Earth System. This new regime can be represented by an Anthropocene equation, where other forcings tend to zero, and the rate of change under human influence can be estimated. Reducing the risk of leaving the glacialinterglacial limit cycle of the late Quaternary for an uncertain future will require, in the first instance, the rate of change of the Earth System to become approximately zero.

___

**Abstract**

The ocean is the largest sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), having absorbed roughly 40 per cent of CO2 emissions since the beginning of the industrial era. Recent data show that oceanic CO2 uptake rates have been growing over the past decade, reversing a trend of stagnant or declining carbon uptake during the 1990s. Here we show that ocean circulation variability is the primary driver of these changes in oceanic CO2 uptake over the past several decades. We use a global inverse model to quantify the mean ocean circulation during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, and then estimate the impact of decadal circulation changes on the oceanic CO2 sink using a carbon cycling model. We find that during the 1990s an enhanced upper-ocean overturning circulation drove increased outgassing of natural CO2, thus weakening the global CO2 sink. This trend reversed during the 2000s as the overturning circulation weakened. Continued weakening of the upper-ocean overturning is likely to strengthen the CO2 sink in the near future by trapping natural CO2 in the deep ocean, but ultimately may limit oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Is There a Stratospheric Pacemaker Controlling the Daily Cycle of Tropical Rainfall?](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL072549/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Rainfall in the tropics exhibits a large, 12-hour sun-synchronous variation with coherent phase around the globe. A long-standing, but unproved, hypothesis for this phenomenon is excitation by the prominent 12-hour atmospheric tide, which itself is significantly forced remotely by solar heating of the stratospheric ozone layer. We investigated the relative roles of large-scale tidal forcing and more local effects in accounting for the 12-hour variation of tropical rainfall. A model of the atmosphere run with the diurnal cycle of solar heating artificially suppressed below the stratosphere still simulated a strong coherent 12-hour rainfall variation (~50% of control run), demonstrating that stratospherically-forced atmospheric tide propagates downward to the troposphere and contributes to the organization of large-scale convection. The results have implications for theories of excitation of tropical atmospheric waves by moist convection, for the evaluation of climate models, and for explaining the recently-discovered lunar tidal rainfall cycle. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the strongest current in the ocean and has a pivotal impact on ocean stratification, heat content, and carbon content. The circumpolar volume transport is relatively insensitive to surface wind forcing in models that resolve turbulent ocean eddies, a process termed eddy saturation. Here a simple model is presented that explains the physics of eddy saturation with three ingredients: a momentum budget, a relation between the eddy form stress and eddy energy, and an eddy energy budget. The model explains both the insensitivity of circumpolar volume transport to surface wind stress and the increase of eddy energy with wind stress. The model further predicts that circumpolar transport increases with increased bottom friction, a counterintuitive result that is confirmed in eddy-permitting calculations. These results suggest an unexpected and important impact of eddy energy dissipation, through bottom drag or lee wave generation, on ocean stratification, ocean heat content, and potentially atmospheric CO2. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Sea-level rise is a global problem, yet to forecast future changes, we must understand how and why relative sea level (RSL) varied in the past, on local to global scales. In East and Southeast Asia, details of Holocene RSL are poorly understood. Here we present two independent high-resolution RSL proxy records from Belitung Island on the Sunda Shelf. These records capture spatial variations in glacial isostatic adjustment and paleotidal range, yet both reveal a RSL history between 6850 and 6500cal years BP that includes two 0.6m fluctuations, with rates of RSL change reaching 134mm per year (2). Observations along the south coast of China, although of a lower resolution, reveal fluctuations similar in amplitude and timing to those on the Sunda Shelf. The consistency of the Southeast Asian records, from sites 2,600km apart, suggests that the records reflect regional changes in RSL that are unprecedented in modern times. </TEXT>
