	<TEXT> Tonight, April 12, at **7pm**

Capitol Theatre, 1390 W. 65 St, Cleveland OH 44102

Looking for something fun to do tonight? The CMNH's Department of Vertebrate Paleontology will be at Capitol Theatre for a trip to the depths of the Amazonian jungle, where a strange prehistoric beast lurks in the murky depths...in **3D**! There will be a unique display of real fossil specimens from the Devonian period, and you can enjoy a one-of-a-kind, fossil-filled introduction and post-film Q A with Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology Dr. Michael Ryan! </TEXT>
