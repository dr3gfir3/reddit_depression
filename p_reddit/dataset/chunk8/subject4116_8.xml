	<TEXT> They were proceeding to fired her so she quit.

That's a quote from you, so you're disagreeing with yourself. 

But regardless, your statement is nonsensical. What about her not being fired means you can't know the difference? I feel like English isn't your first language, hence "we won't know the difference to your question" which while I understand what it's supposed to mean when read literally it makes no sense, and you've just misunderstood what my question is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This needs some clarification to make sure we're talking about the same thing, because that word can have two different meanings depending on the context.
 "Equal" can refer to how much a person is valued, or how important they are, or what rights they have ("equality under the law"). In that context, I most certainly do believe that men and women have equal value. I don't think that women should be denied any rights or whatever.
 But "equal" might also mean "same" as in, identical. Specifically, that would mean, "contributes the same things to the relationship." This would be the context where I'd answer, "no." So if your question is, "how can you connect with a partner if you do not view them as contributing the same things" then my answer is, I don't think that's a requirement in order for a relationship to be healthy or functional. I don't believe a whole must be made of identical parts. My view is that men and women are different, and can compliment each other. Think yin and yang.
 I prefer a relationship where my partner and I agree on complimentary roles. Now, that does not mean that prescribe a role - not in a relationship, and certainly not in society (that is, I wouldn't say something like, "that's a man's job"). Rather, it means that I am comfortable with this preference. I don't think that it's morally wrong or that I should suppress it.
 In practical terms, this is rarely an issue. I just act the way I want to act, and if she doesn't like it, she wont want to hang out with me anymore. If we get along, that's great. If not, don't force it.

That was a mighty long way to say "that depends what the definition of "is" is." </TEXT>

No autopsies done by whom, on who?

just as no intercepted documents or transmissions ever spoke of this plan to gas people to death in the camps.

About 270,000 Jews died, according to the International Red Cross's official count, having had representatives stationed at every prison/labor camp.

	<TEXT>  If the Holocaust were real, or really involved gassing millions of people to death, historical examination would confirm it.

Well it would certainly seem that it does to most people.

If it weren't real, or didn't really involve homicidal gas chambers, the world deserves to know.

Sure, I can agree with that.

The problem is, under scrutiny the story falls apart.

Under what scrutiny? Be specific.

The only evidence of homicidal gas chambers is the photos, lurid stories from prisoners, and a forced confession or two, extracted via torture.

So it's your contention that every account is false? Have you tried corroborating accounts? What evidence do you have of forced confessions?  Could you give an example of one such forced confession, and why you believe it was forced?

The "vast and overwhelming majority" of people who are in positions of academic authority would never dare cast any doubt about the Holocaust narrative because they would lose their tenures and in some countries be arrested. 

Do you understand how tenure works? The main point of tenure is academic freedom. Excepting in countries where holocaust denial is illegal, which is not a concept I agree with, this argument is a load of baloney.


The doors opening inward would be absurdly impractical since you would have a pile of dead bodies blocking the door every time you went in. 

That's a good point, I hadn't thought of that. So I googled around a bit, and from what I can find this was the original design, that the doors would open inward, [but later on the Nazi's learned from their mistake and designed them with doors that opened outward, along with other changes for the sake of efficiency.](http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Hans_HC/media/Overview_slide_door_zps65gp99tm.png.html)

Just one reason this fabled Rube Goldberg system of shaving, gassing, and getting all these people in mass graves would never work on a practical level.

Mass graves? Cmon man, you've clearly done some level of research, you know [there were no mass graves.](https://www.google.ie/search?q=holocaust+piles+of+bodies client=opera hs=8ot source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0ahUKEwjembvO76nTAhXLJMAKHXAsCI8Q_AUICCgB biw=1920 bih=972)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  gas capsules were used for this reason, not for gassing millions of people to death.

Got a source? Or is that your personal contention? What evidence do you have for this interpretation of available data, why do you believe this over other interpretations?

The rooms we are to believe were gas chambers bear little or no resemblance to actual gas chambers as they are wooden, not airtight

Uhhhhhh, I'm looking at the gas chambers on that google search and none of them are wooden. And they all look pretty airtight. 

some of the doors open inward which is preposterous

Explain.

ven if there were a plan for genocide, which there was never any evidence of

And yet, oddly, the vast and overwhelming majority who spend their lives studying historical evidence would disagree. That's a very odd circumstance, don't you think? If that were the case, why would quite so many people, with so much investment into discerning historical truth, disagree? Because I can't think of any reason.


And you still haven't explained what your standard of proof is. What fact(s) could I demonstrate to you that would convince you those chambers were used in the holocaust? </TEXT>
