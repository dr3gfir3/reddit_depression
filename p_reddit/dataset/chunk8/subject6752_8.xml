	<TEXT> Disclaimer: I stutter

Basically my English teacher decided to make my whole seat column (3 tables with 4-5 students each) read a line of a poem. In these situations, I would get ready to say it. I say the line under my breath and when is my turn I just raise the volume. However, I failed. I stuttered. Hard. My classmates laughed at me and even the teacher, so she thought it was a nice idea to repeat the same shit again back to back with the same poem, me reading the same line. Stuttered hard again.

While some of you see this as a bad experience and that my teacher is an asshole, she made try to overcome my stutter and learn how to control it. If you tell me to read that line again, you will be God damn right that I won't stutter </TEXT>

I believe a second card will help, but not necessarily more. If you get a card with the same limit or less than what you already have then it won't help "more".

Just curious, how is your credit? Can you take the hit of doing both? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Transcript for those at work, school, house, library, or in space: 

Royal Giant: Deploy Time to 2sec (from 1sec)

Tweaking his deploy time gives the defender a bit more time to react to Royal Giants played at the bridge or in the pocket (on your side of the Arena once a tower is down). Listen to the latest episode of Radio Royale for more insight on this change and some of the others below!


Elite Barbarians: Hitpoints -4%, initial attack comes 0.1sec slower

This change will make Elite Barbarians a bit easier to deal with. They'll still be a threat and can take down big dudes on defense before going on a counter push, but they won't be quite as punishing.


Furnace: Hitpoints -5%

Furnace offers really nice support to your offense, but its high hitpoints also make it a bit too strong on defense. A small tweak will help here.


Goblin Hut: Hitpoints +5%

Goblin Hut has lived in the shadow of the Furnace for long enough! This change, in conjunction with the one above, should make them both interesting and viable options depending on your deck.

Electro Wizard: Hit Speed to 1.8sec (from 1.7sec)

Electro Wizard offers a bit too much damage and control for a ranged support troop. A lower hit speed will tone him down in both areas.

Executioner: Damage +6%

Now that all of the Executioner's bugs have been ironed out, we can return him to his former glory! This will also make him a great option for countering the increasingly popular Lava Hound based decks.


Balloon: Death Damage delay to 3sec (from 1sec)

It's great to see the Balloon become a more viable offense card since the last change; however, we'd like to add a bit more Death Damage delay to allow for better counterplay.


Skeleton Army: Skeleton count decreased to 14 (from 15)

Another critical change to maintain the delicate balance of "Skeletal equilibrium" within the Arena. Probably.


Lumberjack: Hitpoints +4%

He's strong, fast and drops an interesting Rage effect, but in many situations he simply lacks the hitpoints to be really effective. A few more will help!


Please leave your thoughts and feedback on the forums or reddit!


Edit: Formatting looks good for me. Can anyone tell me if it is messed up on their side so I can fix it?

If you are Host and assuming that you are in a CEWL session, you are basically using the session you are in as a "pool" for other players to join you.  When they join, they will be on the session until you launch the job and get transferred into the job session. 

Now, if one of these peeps quit the lobby when they join, they will be left in the session. They **won't** get transferred to another one. See what's happening here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got banned. 

Reason? 

I asked to mod a month ago. Q responded and asked if I spend time in NYC, which I responded to "I'm a permanent reaident here". He also asked if I could meet with him.

Since I thought he wasn't serious, I responded to him again to see if that's his real purpose/if he is not joking.  He wasn't. He wanted to meet me. So I just ignored the message and moved on.

Now, I took a screenshot of the chat and posted it as a comment as it was being talked about in the post I believe OP posted. Note that I never made a post shitting on the mod, but talked about it when it was brought up.

Now, I don't see where I broke a rule, so I will contact the admins to see if this is mod abuse or not. </TEXT>

iTunes backed up both of your phones before updating. When the update finished, it asked you which backup you wanted to restore. You selected your wife's.

iTunes did exactly as you told it to do. 

Also, note, looks like you pressed the Restore button which will delete everything, including the OS to install it again. You didn't press update that doesn't delete/overwrite data.

* Let us remap the Bixby button

* That case tho. It needs work. There are people who uses cases. Make it good for them.The case is terrible in every way. Color, shape, everything. Is like you made a bikini for them.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry for all the questions. In addition, when I'm charged the .20 cent fee? When I pick up an incoming call? When is sent to voicemail, or just anything that rings my phone? 

How about outbound? If the phone tone plays, am I charged or when the person picks up the phone?

Thank you in advance! </TEXT>
