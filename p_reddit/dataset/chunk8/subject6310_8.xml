	<TEXT> to combat the limited stack issue, i will be using a token system.   
- 7k sulfur for an ak  
- put my own skull in the vending machine for sale for 1 k sulfur  
- have a skull in each one of the vending machines  
- they then grab all of the skulls and place them in a shareable box  
- check the skulls and place the ak in the box  

its tedious and i have to be there for it, but hopefully they up the limit for items to 100k. Really want to sell some higher end gear. 

great video btw u/itsFoorun

	<TITLE> (Suggestion) Master Code for code lock </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-09 16:46:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> - Code locks currently only take one code
- Have a master code that you can place in by holding the 'use' key
- Master code can only be placed by the person placing the lock
- Master code can only be applied when the lock is first placed
- Cannot remove lock without putting in the master code
- Does not matter what regular code is changed to. Master code will still unlock the door 
- 5 digits so less chance of guessing master code.


I believe if they implement the master code this will be a good QOL change. Even if someone guesses your regular code you can still use the master code to get into the doors. This could avoid people getting code raided. Also an extra level of security for players.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As of right now, you only get one per box or barrel. I believe if we upped the amount we receive to about 1 or 2 the scarcity issue might be solved.  </TEXT>
