	<TEXT> Don't go taller than 45. I have the same wheels and there's no way I'd go even beefier since 45 barely clears on the inside. I'm on 235/45/17 and have had no trouble so far. That is, unless you want to mod the car to suit even bigger wheels.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, that's the same size tyre I'm running as well. My fronts are pretty much perfectly flush with the fenders but my rears are still a little further in due to natural camber. Feels as if the car has wider front track than rear. I think yours has even more offset by the looks of it. Yours looks super nice and chunky. How do you find the handling? It made my steering vague (as expected) but I feel as if cornering speeds have greatly improved.

	<TEXT> I go with whatever feels right. I have Michelin PS3s, and the tyre shop filled them to 40psi. After doing quite a bit of spirited, city, and highway driving, I've found that I can go down to about 34psi for spirited which "appears" to help cornering, and up to around 39 for highway. I've done absolutely 0 quantitative tests and I'm only going by feel, but I can feel some difference from low (31) to high (40), only in hard cornering. I am simply assuming higher is better for milage so I pump them up for longer trips.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It came out pretty nice for the small amount of money, it doesn't remove the deep scratches or etchings but does work well on swirls and random patches. I wasn't expecting much at all but I'm impressed that it did anything, it's good for little isolated parts of panels, but it would take absolutely ages to do any significant part of the car (by hand, that is). I applied it with a small foam application pad. It takes a lot of effort to rub the product in and it sucks doing it in the heat (as expected with hand application).

	<TEXT> Anyone on here: http://www.detailparadise.com.au/forum.php

Depends on what you want to get done, $350 probably won't be enough for a properly done polish. The only way you'll probably find this is if you go to one of those generic "detail" shops which probably won't do a very good job. As someone commented before, try Obsession Detailing, he knows his stuff very well and charges very reasonable prices. If you just want a wash + wax/seal + basic interior clean you can probably find it for a lot less.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been using OCW as my spray for some 3 years now. This http://www.motorgeek.co.uk/db_images/OptimumCarWax1.jpg bottle has lasted me the entire time with fairly regular usage. It's very easy to use and is quite idiot proof in application. It also seems to last for a fairly long time as far as I can tell, however I still add some more at least every month. I know you're not supposed to, but I also use it on my plastic interior trim as it leaves a nice smell. 

My only complaint is that it can get very streaky if there's any extra content left behind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely understand what you mean about no lowering. I don't understand how people can put up with it, I can barely get by as it is without scraping. Maybe look at the stock Bilsteins that came on Spec.Bs? What tyres did you get on the new wheels? I found that my new stickier rubber is begging for stiffer suspension (which makes sense, just need to find money for this).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couple more hours? Jeez that's ridiculous, but at least it's an easy fix. Never seen weights put on the inner lip either. That said, the width is pushing it but I've only felt the tiniest bit of rub on the rear before, the fronts have never touched. Looks like you have a saggy rear too haha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Noticed this with a 'clay towel' I bought recently too. I got mine off eBay for some $25 (AUD) to my door, whereas a 'branded' version would have cost me more than double (from $50-60). I think I could have got it even cheaper if I didn't want quick delivery. My generic one appears to be the same as the branded one as far as I can tell. I don't think there's any difference at all. 

The foam cannon looks good, hope the bargain works out for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can use most GPS devices (a phone would do) to find out a more accurate speed. It isn't perfect but it's usually quite close, it won't update quickly enough to properly estimate speed during acceleration but will be fine once you're up to a more constant speed. I find mine spot on when checking with those overhead readout things.  </TEXT>
