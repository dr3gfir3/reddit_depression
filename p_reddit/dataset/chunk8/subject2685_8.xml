	<TEXT> [Picture here of memory](http://i.imgur.com/V1Sh1qw.png).  I can't seem to figure out the leak, because 99% seems to be with UIKIT which I think is necessary.  I use a gpx file for simulated location which I can't seem to activate in build tests.  [Here is also the pastebin file if anyone needs to see the code.](http://pastebin.com/dTYUPWeW)  It just keeps on ending due to memory overload.

	<TEXT> Heyo, trying to learn here and encountered an obstacle in xcode.  If I have a single view app that is running, when it hits a memory level it closes and says "Finished running appname."  Is there a sort of rescue operation I can do to make it automatically restart the app?  Also, I use xcode to run the app, then I have to select a gpx file to simulate GPS.  How can I get it to automatically do that when it restarts? </TEXT>

I see this SORTA exists in steps, for example, I know there are text to image scripts, but I want to know if there are any text to video scripts out there.  Also, if anyone has any advice in general on this.

We found that our last post was a bit outdated, [link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorGaming/comments/2c66ap/free_horror_games_a_masterpost/).  Please note that there are a TON of free horror games out there, but as you may know, many are poor quality, or clones.  This list was created with reviews in mind.  Additionally, the links are not always direct links to download; this was done so you can see descriptions, pictures, kickstarter campaigns, etc.  However, every linked page has either a direct, or one click away, to play.  Please enjoy, this list will be updated regularly as new games come out.

	<TEXT> both.  game is "somewhat still encrypted" because even though they modders have unlocked it, there isn't a big community to share it so not everyone has access to the unlocked code.  Also, the mod community isn't organized well, and there isn't a guide for new modders to learn or build off of other's work, so every new modder is at square one.  Probably only 3-5 real modders but they have lives and are basically hanging on a thread due to lack of interest due to the games hate. </TEXT>

Why force your small team to add new features, when modders across the world could add features and shiz for free and much faster.  Open it up and save the game! </TEXT>

Can I attach a monitor to this one as well for a dual screen, and will that lower the specs of my other monitor/graphics card? My motherboard only has one slot for a graphics card. </TEXT>
