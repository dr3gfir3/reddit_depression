	<TEXT> Its going to be a bloodbath and Labour know it, one Conservative MP said. Were going after people like Liz Kendall, and I think well give her a good run. Lilian Greenwood, Vernon Coaker will be gone as well. Tom Watson is in a bit of trouble as well because hes got a big Ukip vote [which may go Conservative].

Another Midlands Tory MP said: We are going to do very well in the east Midlands and the question is how well. Vernon Coaker is going to have to work very hard to keep that seat, even though hes been there 20 years. In the West Midlands, were going to do even better.

Watsons seat in West Bromwich East is not considered by the party to be at risk and neighbouring Labour MPs who spoke to the Guardian on Wednesday said they had seen no sign yet of a targeted Tory offensive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They were caught hiring FN staff as EU staff and broke rules of what counts as EU assistants. I think this has come out because they refuse to pay back the money but they have been sanctioned for breaking the rules once already. The investigation is about if the sanctions are needed.

Le Pen, specifically, is accused of paying her bodyguard, Thierry Legier, and her chief of staff, Catherine Griset, with EU parliamentary funds. Le Pen is believed to have submitted a "fictional" work contract before the European Parliament presenting Legier as an assistant, while Griset was living near Paris and working on behalf of the FN in France rather than at the European assembly

The European Parliament has already sanctioned Le Pen for allegedly misusing nearly 340,000 euros of EU funds during the 2011-2012 legislature

Since February the far-right nationalist's monthly salary as an MEP has been cut by half to around 3,000 euros and other allowances have been withdrawn. The current investigation aims at establishing whether other sanctions are warranted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Among the most desperate are Palestinians who were already considered refugees in Syria, and so are not eligible to be re-registered by the UN refugee agency when they arrive in Lebanon. They live in overcrowded camps and receive very little aid.

Almost as vulnerable are those who arrived from Syria after May 2015, when the Lebanese government asked the UN to stop registering new refugees.

"Those who are not registered as refugees are struggling," Abu Jaafar says. "What can they do? They are desperate and they have no other means to survive but to sell their organs."

...

"I don't really care if the client dies, I got what I wanted. It's not my problem what happens next as long as the client got paid."
His most recent client was a 17-year-old boy who left Syria after his father and brothers were killed there.

He's been in Lebanon for three years with no work and mounting debt, struggling to support his mother and five sisters.
So, through Abu Jaafar, he agreed to sell his right kidney for $8,000 (6,250).

...

Across the Middle East there's a shortage of organs for transplant, because of cultural and religious objections to organ donation. Most families prefer immediate burial.
But Abu Jaafar claims there are at least seven other brokers like him operating across Lebanon.

"Business is booming," he says. "It's growing and not decreasing. It definitely boomed after the Syrian migration to Lebanon."

Here's an excerpt.

Fuelled by cheap state loans, local authorities are trying to plug the funding gap with property investments

When the local council on the Isle of Wight off Britains south coast prepares to make a 100m punt on the commercial property market, something strange is surely afoot. Yet the decision, taken earlier this year on the genteel island that was home to the ageing Queen Victoria and the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson, is far from unique. In fact the Isle of Wight will be a latecomer to a local government real estate party that has acquired serious momentum.

Across the UK, local councils have been plunging into the commercial property market or embarking on residential property development, either for sale or for the private rental market.

They are punting like drunken sailors all around the country, says a bemused fund manager who has been outbid by local authorities on more than one investment this year.

...

At the end of 2016, according to estate agents Colliers International, local councils were able to access a 45-year loan from this ancient body at a fixed rate of 2.45 per cent.

For some, this is alarmingly redolent of earlier fiascos in the UK, especially the financial crisis. Lord Oakeshott, chairman of Olim Property, investment manager of 650m of commercial property for pension funds, charities and investment trusts, says: English councils punting on property is an accident waiting to happen.

He adds: There are real echoes here of Northern Rock, where many punters were lent all the purchase price of a property, and the Icelandic bank scandals, where councils played a market they didnt understand for short-term income gain.

...

Everywhere the motive is the same: to generate additional revenue to maintain services  housing for the elderly, childrens centres, libraries and the rest  that might otherwise fall victim to the Treasurys remorseless squeeze on local government finance.

Another motivating factor is a change in local government funding rules. From 2020 local authorities will be allowed to keep 100 per cent of their tax revenues from businesses, rather than the 50 per cent they can at the moment. This is intended to compensate them for the shrinkage of grants from central government. It gives them a strong incentive to promote growth in their local economies to expand their business tax base.

....

There is a larger irony in the role of the Treasury: under George Osborne and now Philip Hammond, it has caused local authorities to bear the brunt of its commitment to austerity. Yet via the PWLB it is simultaneously encouraging lowly paid local authority bureaucrats to behave like entrepreneurial risk takers on cheap public money.

The verdict of Olims Lord Oakeshott is telling: As with Northern Rock and Icelandic banks, theres a serious systemic risk to the property market and financial stability developing here, but the Treasury and Bank of England are fast asleep to it yet again.

Oversight: Politicians see risk in property plays

There is one important difference between the current burst of UK local government property speculation and earlier fiascos. This time red flags are already being raised, most notably by the public accounts committee of the House of Commons. It produced a damning report in November that accused the Department for Communities and Local Government, which oversees local government finance, of complacency  especially in relation to the huge increase in property investment.

At a parliamentary hearing departmental officials argued that commercial investments were no more risky than managing social care demand pressures and appeared to have little grasp of the scale of local government activity in property or any understanding of the risk inherent in highly geared deals. Committee members worried that the commercial skills required in the property market were not a good fit with local authority pay scales.
This concern was echoed in March in a speech by Baroness Wheatcroft, a member of the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords. Referring to Portsmouth city councils purchase of shops in Redditch, a Mercedes showroom near Southampton and a warehouse near Gloucestershire as well as a deal on a local ferry terminal, she remarked: I am prepared to believe that local authorities know a lot about social housing, but I am not convinced of their knowledge about Mercedes showrooms or ferry terminals.

Despite these warnings the local authorities rush into property continues, with no hindrance from the government. Local authorities should stick to their own patch and borrow money for local housing and regeneration investments, says Lord Oakeshott, chairman of Olim Property.
Its utterly wrong for them to be punting taxpayers cash at council taxpayers risk on commercial property many miles away, giving estate agents and lawyers a fees bonanza, he adds. Professional investors can see them a mile off and cant believe their luck.

I called the hospital who refused to speak to me. They just told me to speak to Virgin Care. You can't speak to Virgin Care. Only leave voice mails to which they don't respond. I wrote a letter to which they responded. I got an initial assessment appointment and again have heard nothing since. I still haven't seen a consultant. In all since seeking a referral from my GP it has been 18 months. This is the new Tory Health care. And it is targeted at your children. If you want this for your babies. Carry on and vote Tory in June. My child is in pain, bleeding and she is ignored because we are poor. We have no NHS to go to anymore. This is your UK if you want to save our NHS. Do something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is one story where a young boy was abducted and found later dead with bottom half of his body missing.

Sex worker called the family saying he saw the boy at a notorious brothel where rich and politicians were patrons. Its likley he wasn't the only victim who died and I think there's victims from child care homes say they were taken to that house to be abused. 

I think pizzagate shop is a false one, but there are places like that which have existed. Like Jeffery Epistien only got 11 months for child sex island. Prince Andrew got off for sleeping with one of the girls. Current and former president is linked to him and the victims claim Jeffery collected info from them to blackmail his powerful friends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Home Office is trying to discourage EU nationals from applying for permanent residence in the UK to avoid being deluged by applications after the triggering of the Article 50 Brexit clause.

According to new guidance released this month, EU citizens are instead advised to sign up for emailed news alerts that will tell them if and when they need to take action over their UK residence. However, there is no indication the British government is offering any new guarantees over their status post-Brexit.

The updated advice  initially emailed to immigration professionals and now posted on the Home Office website  clearly discourages EU nationals from embarking on the 85-page residence application.

You do not need to do anything as a result of Article 50 being triggered. There will be no change to the rights and status of EU nationals living in the UK while the UK remains in the EU, it reads.

Under EU law you dont need a document to confirm your residence status in the UK. If youre planning to apply for a document just to confirm your status, you can sign up for email alerts instead. Those updates, the guidance adds, will inform interested parties about future steps to confirm their status in the UK post-Brexit.



One immigration lawyer said that while the Home Office had always maintained EU citizens were under no legal obligation to secure residence in Britain before Brexit, the guidance now amounted to officials saying quite forcefully...please, dont apply.

Nick Rollason, partner and head of business immigration at law firm Kingsley Napley, said the message was an attempt by the Home Office to calm people down and allay their fears that they need documentation.

He suggested that officials were trying to delay an expected avalanche of applications until the Brexit negotiations provided greater clarity on the rights of EU nationals in Britain.

I dont think theres any question that the Home Office will eventually put in place a process that allows EU nationals to prove their residence in an easier, quicker way, Mr Rollason said. The idea would be that the Home Office could deal with applications more easily and applicants could send in fewer documents. While the current system has been improved, it still takes up a huge amount of caseworker time.

According to Home Office figures, more than 92,000 permanent residence applications were received from EU nationals in 2016. While the latest data have not been published, the total number is expected to be well over 100,000.

The figure has jumped steeply since last Junes referendum but it still represents only a fraction of the estimated 3m EU citizens currently in the UK. The Home Office announced last month that it was hiring an extra 240 staff in its Liverpool visa office to speed up processing times. But it is limited by budget cuts and does not have the resources to deal with a sustained increase in applications between now and the Brexit deadline of spring 2019.

The Home Office is facing criticism of its permanent residence process on several fronts. Despite some successful moves to streamline the system and reduce the amount of documentary evidence that applicants need to supply, some EU nationals are still being rejected on the basis that they did not take out comprehensive sickness insurance, which is a requirement under freedom of movement rules.

	<TEXT> The proposal to temporarily suspend enforcement of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) in the next war would only protect the Ministry of Defence from scrutiny in the courts and damage the UKs international reputation, the two organisations have told the joint committee on human rights (JCHR).

The president of the Law Society, Robert Bourns, said: The proposal to opt out of an international human rights agreement to prevent false legal claims is not only disproportionate, it is dangerous. 

This could stop genuine claims ever being heard and would undermine hard-won international accords that protect our most fundamental shared values. Even claims for negligence brought by our own armed forces against the Ministry of Defence, for instance for providing inadequate equipment, could be blocked.

In no other area of law would it even be considered that all cases be shut down in order to prevent false claims or save money. It is the role of the justice system to determine the merit of each case, a function that is and must remain separate from government. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It made some sense we didn't have home appliances, clothing to buy, and food trade back generations and generations ago.

 If you wanted new clothes, or a cooked meal someone had to stay home and make it from scratch and that would take all day with the lack of technology and supermarkets. Given that birth control was not a thing and lot of work was manual and tough, it ended up forcing women to stay behind. Yet if the father died, got injured, or ran off women sometimes were forced also to work in some factories. 

Having two parents go to work makes sense now as the home chores are no longer an all day hard task but more optional for one partner to stay at home. Also you can work and be pregnant in lot of fields as maternity is covered and its less physical or prone to work place injury. The two world wars with men coming home injured or not at all also forced changes for women needing to be a income supplier to families more so than when men were injured at work in the past.  </TEXT>

Vehicle access was curtailed in 1973 when metal barriers were placed across the entrance to the street.[16] In 1974, the Metropolitan Police proposed erecting a semi-permanent barrier between the pavement and carriageway on the Foreign Office side to keep pedestrians off the main part of the street. The proposal came with assurances that tourists would still be permitted to take photographs at the door of Number 10. The **Prime Minister, Harold Wilson**, rejected the proposal, feeling that it would appear to be an unacceptable restriction of the freedom of the public. Wilson's private secretary wrote "I much regret this further erosion of the Englishman's right to wander at will in Downing Street."[17] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Council was busy demolishing the slums and rehousing their population in newly built Council Estates such as Angel Town and Stockwell Park. Private owners were either selling their run down property to West Indians at extortionate prices, or to developers that accumulated properties and simply let them crumble away empty, waiting to cash on the promised regeneration of the area. Lambeth Council had in the pipeline ambitious plans for demolition and development, and so repairs were not being made to their existing housing stock.

For those people who fell between the twin stools of home ownership and council housing (ie those who would traditionally have been housed in the private sector), opportunities were shrinking, rents rocketing and security diminishing. This increasing desperation of people at the bottom end of the housing market together with the growing number of empty houses, led to the growth of squatting both in scale and scope.

Not much changes except they've made squatting illegal.

If you like this sort of history in London Freedom Press usually has books on it
