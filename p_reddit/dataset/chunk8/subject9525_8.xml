	<TEXT> There was a guy in WWII who refused to kill any nazi soldiers at all because he was seventh day adventist christian and killing was against his beliefs. There's a movie about him coming out called "Hacksaw Ridge". Andrew Garfield plays the guy.

	<TEXT> You can't decide that it's a bad move simply because you like moo as a person. He is an above average offlaner at best. And sure, he rekt the opposition as timbersaw and won DC games. But there are tons of other offlaners (take moon as an example) who are better at tempo control, game making, etc. And if replacing moo makes the team stronger, misery was well within his rights.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You guys forget that the 9k tag comes with some amount of ego. Miracle underestimating his opponents with overly aggressive positioning leading to team wipe or 4 man wipes was evidence of that. Arteezy and miracle would not gel well enough to work as a team.  </TEXT>
