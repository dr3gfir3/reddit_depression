	<TEXT> I may add a link I've posted a while ago: [A Brief Introduction to Stoicism](http://www.philosophyforbeginners.com/philosophers/introduction-to-stoicism/). This is a collection of really excellent resources (Massimo Pigliucci's lecture [Stoicism 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLLJP3H1FU), for example). Our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq) is excellent, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are some modern introductions like *Stoicism and the Art of Happiness* by Donald Robertson, which is the modern introduction I usually recommend to people who like to read an introduction to modern Stoicism. I have not read the latest yet, but the Stoic Week Handbooks are quite good, too, and can be downloaded as PDFs for free.

Do you like more academic books? *Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life* by Anthony A. Long and *The Inner Citadel* by Pierre Hadot certainly belong to the best books about Stoicism. Robertson is an easier read. Long and Hadot, however, go deeper into Stoic philosophy. </TEXT>

I cannot say anything relevant for his recordings since 1980, but it is certainly wrong to say that he has been impossible to understand since the 1960s.

I fully agree that using Stoic concepts for gaining success in externals cannot be called Stoicism anymore. Stoicism, however, is not even about happiness, it is really all about virtue. The Stoics say that by living according to virtue one may eventually be happy, but that's not the goal either. The point is, that as soon as virtue is not the sole good, something is not Stoicism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand that animal experiments may eventually be the only way certain research can be done, but I would not be able to do it.

At the end it depends on which kind of ethics one subscribes to. An utilitarian may say that this kind of research helps so many people such that the positives outweigh the negatives by far, even if that involves killing of animals.

Buddhist ethics, however, is no utilitarian ethics, it is an example of virtue ethics. Researching ways of healing cancer and the like certainly is a very good intention indeed, but killing animals is still vicious. Inasmuch good intentions can outweigh the viciousness of killing animals may be debatable. However, as soon as one doubts doing the right thing, it is certainly better to not do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I know, Commodus is not being seen in a positive light today either (and that's not what I claimed anyway). However, more is known about the bias and unreliability of the few existing sources than two centuries ago, for example. This and the research of more than two centuries in general cause historians see things more differentiatedly in many areas.

Today I have begun reading Anthony R. Birley's biography of Marcus Aurelius and he discusses exactly that problem at the beginning of the book. I want to give a very short summary of the discussion of those sources which are the same as regarding Commodus.

Cassius Dio, for example, was the main source for Gibbon's extremely bad picture of Commodus. According to Birley, Cassius Dio (like others) loved Marcus and hated Commodus. Although he does not appear to distort facts unduly, he was very biased in favor of Marcus and against Commodus. (I remember reading elsewhere, that the wickedness of Commodus was tendentially being exaggerated in order to let Marcus appear even greater, but I unfortunately forgot the historian's name who wrote that, so please take that with a grain of salt.)

Another well-known source is the *Augustan History* portraying the emperors from Hadrianus to Carinus. We know that the alleged authors did not even exist and that a lot of citations of documents are bogus and the work of the (unknown) authors of the *Augustan History*.

The historical works of Marius Maximus, Herodian and few others contain some useable material about the major emperors like Marcus, but are completely fictional elsewhere. </TEXT>

Seneca wrote in his [39^th letter to Lucilius](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_39):

 It is the quality of a great soul to scorn great things and to prefer that which is ordinary rather than that which is too great. For the one condition is useful and life-giving; but the other does harm just because it is excessive. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Rome's Last Citizen: The Life and Legacy of Cato, Mortal Enemy of Caesar by Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni | reviewed by Massimo Pigliucci </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Cato was a famous role model for the ancient Stoics and certainly worth being studied. Therefore, I was quite delighted to see that Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni wrote a biography of Cato  *Rome's Last Citizen: The Life and Legacy of Cato, Mortal Enemy of Caesar*. I ordered the book soon after reading this [interview with Jimmy Soni](http://dailystoic.com/jimmy-soni-interview/), which was how I became aware of the book.

Fortunately, Massimo Pigliucci published a series of articles about the book on his blog which is quite interesting for those who want to learn more about Cato:

**Massimo Pigliucci: The Cato chronicles**

[part I: young Cato](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2016/09/24/the-cato-chronicles-part-i-young-cato/)

[part II: Cato becomes a Stoic](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/the-cato-chronicles-part-ii-cato-becomes-a-stoic/)

[part III: commander, and brother](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2016/09/29/the-cato-chronicles-part-iii-commander-and-brother/)

[part IV: the clash with Cicero](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2016/10/01/the-cato-chronicles-part-iv-the-clash-with-cicero/)

[part V: death](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2016/10/04/the-cato-chronicles-part-v-death/)

I have read two of Donald Robertson's books (*The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy* and *Teach Yourself Stoicism and the art of Happiness*), which I like and usually recommend as modern introductions to Stoicism. I also liked the previous handbooks and expect the new one to be at least as good. But I think that calling it perfect may not be the most virtuous thing to do (though I noticed the question mark).

Personally, I think that Epictetus' *Enchiridion* and *Discourses*, Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, and Seneca's *Essays* and *Letters to Lucilius* are a lot nearer to perfection than all modern introductions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I was leaning toward virtue ethics before I took a serious look at Stoicism anyway, because I am convinced that philosophy ought to be practiced, it cannot just be an exercise in logic chopping. And Stoicism offers a beautifully constructed, yet sufficiently flexible, system of thought that can guide ones life day by day.

Very well said! Thanks for posting the interesting interview.

 We may use iPhones rather than parchment to take our notes on, but it seems like human nature hasnt changed that much, for better or for worse. Thats why Stoicism (and its Eastern equivalent, as Ive come to think of it, Buddhism) is still very much relevant today.

Buddhist ethics is certainly another example of virtue ethics and Buddhism may share some teachings with Stoicism indeed. But one should not forget about the context of the similarities within each tradition and about what sets Buddhism and Stoicism apart from other religions and philosophies and, of course, from each other.

That being said, I have some some doubts about Buddhism and Stoicism being equivalents, but I would be very interested in Massimo Pigliucci's reasons for coming to think of Buddhism that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stoicism has basically ceased to exist as school with the death of Marcus Aurelius. It has been studied and adapted from then until today though. Unfortunately, we don't know exactly how it was lived and how it was taught, apart from transcripts of some lectures of Epictetus. There is a difference between how a philosophy or religion is actually lived and what we would expect from studying its theory. /u/cleomedes has written an [excellent comment about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/555lbv/the_dark_side_of_buddhism/d89j9qk).

The purest form of Stoicism may be found in the original works which have survived. Generally, I prefer reading Seneca, Epictetes and Marcus Aurelius and some other ancient works to modernizations. I also like reading more academic works like Anthony A. Long's *Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life* and Pierre Hadot's *The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius*. </TEXT>

In this context it may be interesting to study the reception history as described, for example, in Donald S. Lopez's books [*From Stone to Flesh: A Short History of the Buddha*](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo5904832.html) and especially in [*The Scientific Buddha: His Short and Happy Life*](http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300159127/scientific-buddha) ([here](http://info-buddhism.com/Scientific_Buddha_Lopez.html) is a short article by the author). In this case it is about a living tradition. Stoicism, however, ceased to exist as active philosophy long ago. The more relevant is your skepsis:

 This is part of why I am a bit skeptical of how well modern reconstructions of Stoic practice in daily life actually match historical Stoicism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are so many problems, I am going to concentrate on only three. I asked if you read the article, because they are so obvious.

It begins with Buddhism being nihilistic. That's not true, Buddhism was thought to be nihilistic by some very early interpreters like Nietzsche when not much was known about Buddhism, but it is not nihilistic and Buddha rejected nihilism (and eternalism).

He gives a disturbing anecdote which may have happened like that or not (maybe it was only a bad joke by a monk). But anecdotes are just anecdotes and do not tell that much as he wants his readers to believe. The way he uses the anecdote is not sound. And why is he talking about the soul and the reincarnation of a soul all the time? One of the most known teachings of Buddhism is that there is nothing like what we typically understand as soul. He himself criticizes exactly that later in the article. The Buddhist understanding of karma is also completely different to his more New Age-like understanding.

Among all other problems it is also disturbing how he quotes the Dalai Lama and interpretes the (shortened) quote as malignly as possible. He is completely wrong that one has to take exactly one meditation posture precisely, since there are many different meditation postures in the Buddhist countries and virtually no one makes his claims.


That being said, there are some superficial similarities and teachings Buddhism and Stoicism have in common. Buddhist and Stoic ethics are both examples of virtue ethics. There are also some interesting articles like *Roman Buddha* by William Ferraiolo which compare Buddhism and Stoicism more broadly than I am able to.

I don't think that Buddhism and Stoicism are related. Buddhism may have had some influence on Pyrrhonism, but even that is speculative. The similarities have to be seen in relation to their position and function within both traditions, which is not being done most often. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are not doing that weekly, because we are doing that all the time: What you describe is already the regular content and it is the major part of this subreddit. Collecting the regular content in one weekly thread would be extremely confusing and chaotic. There is a good reason for creating single threads.

These weekly threads are almost always actions of moderators to collect recurring posts of the same type into one single thread, such that they don't annoy people by being posted separatedly. I don't think that the mentioned kind of discussions are annoying, they are simply the regular content of this subreddit.

There are also not so many posts by people advertizing their own blogs. Actually, I know of only one person advertizing for Stoic Week who does just that and not much more than that. Most of us (like me) share articles they find interesting. That's what reddit is for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are more reasons for contemplating death, but one reason is time and how to get the most out of life.

 Every moment that I am alive, I know that my life will continue into the next moment.

I am surprised to read that, because I don't know how much of my time is left and I am quite sure you don't know when you are going to die either.

Contrarily to common belief, death is of concern to us every moment of our lives:

 What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands. ([Seneca](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_1))

Time is ours and it is precious and we don't know how much of it we have. Therefore, we shall use it carefully and be greedy with it. A large portion of our life passes while we are spoiling our precious time.

According to Seneca, learning to live is learning to die.

 There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living: there is nothing that is harder to learn. Of the other arts there are many teachers everywhere; some of them we have seen that mere boys have mastered so thoroughly that they could even play the master. It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, andwhat will perhaps make you wonder moreit takes the whole of life to learn how to die. ([Seneca](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/seneca_younger/brev_e.html))

Contemplation of death is not about death, it is about getting the most out of our lives. I highly recommend studying Seneca's [On the Shortness of Life](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/seneca_younger/brev_e.html) in that regard.

 So it isthe life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it. Just as great and princely wealth is scattered in a moment when it comes into the hands of a bad owner, while wealth however limited, if it is entrusted to a good guardian, increases by use, so our life is amply long for him who orders it properly. ([Seneca](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/seneca_younger/brev_e.html))

Another reasons are [the terrors of death](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_4) and [how to despise death](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_24). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think it's not only interesting what Massimo Pigliucci likes about them, but also what you like about them.

Shortly after submitting my post I had to leave to attend an interesting event, which prevented me from being the (supposed) first to answer my question. I am going to catch up now.

It was quite interesting to read Massimo Pigliucci's preferences. Personally, I like Seneca for nearly the same reasons and I can only repeat most of the article in this regard.

Epictetus' *Enchiridion* is excellent, but I prefer his discourses so much. Reading them feels like actually listening to a really great teacher. I love his approach to philosophy, his humor, his Socratic style of teaching and I wished I could attend his lectures. I am so grateful for being able to experience his lectures at least this way.

Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations* is the book I carry with me most of the time when I am on the way. It may not be as polished as Seneca's works and it is also so different to Epictetus' discourses. It is the philosophical diary of an experienced Stoic with so many philosophical thoughts and struggles. My fascination is growing the more I am studying this book. I learn so much from him. It is also somehow comforting that even an experienced Stoic like Marcus Aurelius writes [a passage like this](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Thoughts_of_the_Emperor_Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus/Book_IV):

 Thou wilt soon die, and thou art not yet simple, nor free from perturbations, nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things, nor kindly disposed towards all; nor dost thou yet place wisdom only in acting justly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/loversclub quoted Epictetus:

 Don't explain your philosophy. Embody it.

And that's certainly the best advice. Making other people change is not within your control. Better concentrate on what is within your control, your judgements, opinions, thoughts, knowledge of Stoicism. You are also wrong in thinking that diplomas in education are stupid. They are not. Not using them virtuously is stupid.

Explaining your philosophy may make things even worse. You may have misunderstood something and therefore explain parts of Stoicism fatally wrong. Your actions may be perceived contrarily to your explanations by others, too. However, even if that is not the case at all, for clueless people Stoicism may be a little bit strange at first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  [**Cynicism**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p003k9js)

 Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Cynics, the performance artists of philosophy. Eating live octopus with fresh lupins, performing intimate acts in public places and shouting at passers by from inside a barrel is behaviour not normally associated with philosophy. But the Cynics were different. They were determined to expose the meaninglessness of civilised life by action as well as by word. They slept rough, ate simply and gave their lectures in the market place. Perhaps surprisingly, their ideas and attitudes were immensely popular in the ancient world. But how coherent was cynicism as a philosophy? What was its influence on literature and politics and is there any truth to the contention that Jesus himself was influenced by the Cynics? With Angie Hobbs, Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Warwick; Miriam Griffin, Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford; John Moles, Professor of Latin, University of Newcastle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/28366049/Epicurus_Father_of_the_Enlightenment)

 Epicurus (341-270 BC) was, with Plato and Aristotle, one of the three great philosophers of the ancient world. He developed an integrated system of ethics and natural philosophy that, he claimed and many accepted, showed everyone the way to a life of the greatest happiness. The school that he founded remained open for 798 years after his death. While it lost place during the last 200 of these years, his philosophy held until then a wide and often decisive hold on the ancient mind.

 The revival of Epicureanism in the 17th century coincided with the growth of scientific rationalism and classical liberalism. There can be no doubt these facts are connected. It may, indeed, be argued that the first was a leading cause of the second two, and that we are now living in a world shaped, in every worthwhile sense, by the ideas of Epicurus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the original article: R Zhang, M Asai, C E Mahoney, M Joachim, Y Shen, G Gunner, J A Majzoub. **Loss of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone markedly reduces anxiety behaviors in mice.** *Molecular Psychiatry*, 2016; [DOI: 10.1038/mp.2016.136](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp2016136a.html)

 **Abstract**

 A long-standing paradigm posits that hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) regulates neuroendocrine functions such as adrenal glucocorticoid release, whereas extra-hypothalamic CRH has a key role in stressor-triggered behaviors. Here we report that hypothalamus-specific Crh knockout mice (Sim1CrhKO mice, created by crossing Crhflox with Sim1Cre mice) have absent Crh mRNA and peptide mainly in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) but preserved Crh expression in other brain regions including amygdala and cerebral cortex. As expected, Sim1CrhKO mice exhibit adrenal atrophy as well as decreased basal, diurnal and stressor-stimulated plasma corticosterone secretion and basal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, but surprisingly, have a profound anxiolytic phenotype when evaluated using multiple stressors including open-field, elevated plus maze, holeboard, lightdark box and novel object recognition task. Restoring plasma corticosterone did not reverse the anxiolytic phenotype of Sim1CrhKO mice. Crh-Cre driver mice revealed that PVHCrh fibers project abundantly to cingulate cortex and the nucleus accumbens shell, and moderately to medial amygdala, locus coeruleus and solitary tract, consistent with the existence of PVHCrh-dependent behavioral pathways. Although previous, nonselective attenuation of CRH production or action, genetically in mice and pharmacologically in humans, respectively, has not produced the anticipated anxiolytic effects, our data show that targeted interference specifically with hypothalamic Crh expression results in anxiolysis. Our data identify neurons that express both Sim1 and Crh as a cellular entry point into the study of CRH-mediated, anxiety-like behaviors and their therapeutic attenuation. </TEXT>

I cannot add much to /u/cleomedes' comment, but I want to mention that the classification of pleasure may be a little bit more complicated, [according to Jan Edward Garrett](http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/stoa/stovals.htm#indif) (I have highlighted the passage bold which I am referring to):

 The Greek word "*hedone*" is ambiguous. On the one hand, it represents a class of passions or emotions and falls under the class of evil things. There I have translated it "delight." On the other hand, it represents physical pleasure. **Some ancient reporters regarding Stoicism place physical pleasure among the preferred indifferents; others say that it has some positive value but not enough to be included even among the preferred indifferents.** Cicero is aware of the distinction between these two meanings of "*hedone*," translating it as "*laetitia*" (delight) when he means the emotion, as "*voluptas*" (pleasure) when he means physical pleasure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do I understand you correctly, that you consider to limit learning because learning is pleasant to you? There may be a limit indeed which is reached when too many other important things are left undone otherwise. Pleasure per se is no reason for a limit. It is wise to use indifferents in a way that they contribute to virtue. Pleasure which contributes to virtue is fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://epicurussite.wordpress.com/2016/08/26/science-meaning-spirituality/)

 PP theorists frequently cite the virtue ethics of Aristotle; for example,  Wong (2011) explicitly references him in the context of a proposed PP 2.0 model in which moral psychology will figure prominently. But Aristotle is not the only Ancient Greek to have created an ethical-therapeutic system. Epicurus of Samos (341-270 BCE) grounded his own therapeutic moral psychology on a secure knowledge of the natural world, for only by banishing fear of the gods and of death was the Epicurean able to attain tranquillity (ataraxia). Taking a modern neo-Epicurean perspective reminds us that the findings of the natural sciences ought to form the foundation of PP 2.0 moral-psychological theories. Specifically, the purposeless universe described by modern physics must be taken seriously by positive psychologists when using ambiguous and potenially ontologically-loaded terms such as meaning and spirituality. The resulting worldview, in which science and spirituality are carefully distinguished but nonetheless compatible, still offers scope for experiencing Wongs Chaironic happiness.

	<TEXT> You do not have to behave like a statue, because you are no statue. You are allowed to be happy and to experience emotions in general as long as it does not interfer with virtue.

For someone who usually is a pretty reserved person, the contrast between an enthusiastic state of mind and the normal state seems high. Others, however, may not percieve your enthusiastic state of mind (or what they see of it from the outside, respectively) as extreme as you do. It may not be as bad as you think.

In the case it is really as bad as you think, you may remind yourself of the impermanency of all things and of enthusiastic states of mind in particular and try to enjoy them more quietly without making too many promisses. You may take your enthusiasm as an impulse for doing good to other people, though. But do not promise anything, do something! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stoicism does not free us from responsibility and it does not prevent us from standing up and continuing afterwards. Quite the opposite is the case! Stoicism is very much about taking responsibility. Feeling responsible for something which is not under our control can paralize us and prevent us from taking resposibility for what we actually are responsible for. Stoicism is very helpful indeed in that regard! </TEXT>

 When one is immersed into a particular philosophy or point of view it is always a good idea to hear some vigorous critique of it. This will help us maintain a critical attitude toward our own beliefs, and as a bonus it will allow us to practice the virtue of temperance, since people are apt to get seriously irritated when their positions are critiqued by others!

	<TEXT>  Except that there has been a lot of advancement in philosophy since then, and Stoics seemed to consider themselves philosophers, first and foremost.

A philosopher has to be ready to question everything, also his own tradition. If that leads to rejecting too many Stoic core doctrines to call oneself a Stoic, then one will have to stop calling oneself a Stoic. That's a matter of intellectual honesty.

 IMO the main component that defines a Stoic is the values

No. Several non-Stoic philosophies share its core values, even opposing schools like Epicureanism. One has to look at what sets a philosophy apart from other philosophies, at what really defines a philosophy. In Stoicism that's virtue being the sole good, for example. </TEXT>

 Thou wilt soon die, and thou art not yet simple, nor free from perturbations, nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things, nor kindly disposed towards all; nor dost thou yet place wisdom only in acting justly.

I have read that book, too, and do not remember any CBT aspect which I would call 'hardcore'. While I think that starting with the original texts is better than reading polular introductions, "Stoicism and the art of happiness" actually is quite a good popular introduction.

That being said, nothing can replace original texts. </TEXT>

Thus we have to either take Stoicism as it is or adopt it and develop it further in a reasonable manner.

However, I think that Stoicism is still basically right. Its underlying science needs a major upgrade, of course, but otherwise we are basically talking about refinements.

	<TEXT> The secularized Western version of Buddhism is very different to what Buddhists have been practicing for about 2500 years now and what scholars of Buddhism are writing about. It is this so-called secular Buddhism which is particularly similar to Stoicism in some ways.

But it is also right that different traditions from all over the world often have important parts in common and can complement each other to some degree. Studying different traditions thoroughly can be very rewarding, but be aware of generalizing too much after doing only superficial comparisons.

I think that participating in practices from other traditions is not wrong per se as long as they are not vicious and help being virtuous. We must, however, keep the balance right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It is a comforting thought indeed. But it is also untrue.

We are talking about an ancient philosophy and our opinions cannot change the content of past philosophies. They had a certain knowledge of the world and they taught providence, which was an important part of their philosophy. There may be good reasons for not believing in certain interpretations of providence today indeed, but the truth is that the Stoics did believe in providence and that we are talking about an ancient philosophy.

 Bringing truth to the mind is a cental part of Stoicism - or at least that is my assumption.

Nobody is forcing one to call oneself a Stoic. One may add and remove parts from Stoicism and integrate parts of other philosophies for one own's worldview, but there is a certain point where we are not talking about Stoicism anymore. There is nothing wrong with eclecticism, giving something a wrong label is wrong. Just don't call yourself a Stoic - it's better to [keep one's identity small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) anyway.

 So modern Stoics should adopt scientific worldview, not false beliefs about creator God(s) or external meaning.

Ancient Stoics did not believe in creator God(s). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Things like unnecessary idle time distract us from living to our nature and thus are not virtuous.

You are certainly right, but I'm afraid, this can be misunderstood too easily... Human beings need idle time to work well. Seneca writes about that explicitely, but at the moment I cannot remember where. Inasmuch idle time helps us in being virtuous, it is a good thing. There can be too much idle time, but also not enough.

I just wanted to add that comment, because there are people who seem to think that idle time, pleasure and other indifferents like that were bad. However, considering indifferents as bad per se is not wiser than considering indifferents as good per se. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. I have been thinking about that increasingly these days. Together with the Epicureans, the Stoics were the materialists of their age, and they identified *logos* with god nevertheless. I don't want to call it that way because of the obvious connotations, but it's still very important to me: not only does it belong to the logical basis of Stoicism, it is the reason why the Stoics believed in the principal equality of all humans. The reception history of Stoicism is fascinating in that regard, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm quite enthusiastic about your summary. Writing down one's understanding of Stoicism like that is an excellent idea and I am certainly going to do the same. I may add to the idea that writing down one's philosophy may be a good starting point for a philosophic journal like Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*.

Maybe you could have been a little bit more specific about *logos*. In my opinion, it is not self-evident that the cosmos can be explained rationally and that working mathematical models of the cosmos can be developed. It's like there is an inherent rationality of the cosmos, which is something the ancients called *logos*. Does that meet your understanding of *logos*? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has nothing to do with Christian theology or even a theist god like the Christian, Jewish or Muslim one. I am not happy with the word because of its connotation, but it's actually true that the Stoics included something in their physics which we would call theology today. This is even a fundamental part of Stoic philosophy, since they derived their virtue ethics and much more from that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  For the uninitiated that statement is rather difficult to unpackage.

When I read your answer, I was tempted to agree with you at first, but I have no clue how to summarize Stoicism in one sentence better than /u/bytor99 did. I don't even think it's possible to do that, since Stoicism can be hard to understand for most uninitiated even without a limitation like that. Just tell people that things like wealth and health are indifferents... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have found this on the blog of Massimo Pigliucci and according to my understanding there is no trichotomy of control, I think it should be in fact a dichotomy, at least according to Epictetus.

On the other hand, we would do virtually nothing, if we did only what is under our control. This would not be in agreement with the teachings of Epictetus, who uses an example of an athlete who has to train much for a competition, if the athlete wants to win, although the result of the competition is outside of the athlete's control. The athlete has to pay a price to get a prize. Another one of Epictetus' examples is that of a politician.

A diagram like that has to simplify the Stoic teachings in some way, but it certainly should not be wrong, and in this case the diagram may be at least misleading in that regard, if I have understood it correctly. How, do you think, could it be improved? </TEXT>
