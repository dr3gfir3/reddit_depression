	<TEXT> oh really? what's the fuss about "why are e-books more expensive" then? I'm trying to find an argument to how we can "increase book selling".. and one of my arguments is to make e-books cheaper since I found alot of posts regarding how e-books are more expensive and even Amazon thinks that.

I'm kind of confused now :/3

	<TEXT> hey! 

This is my first time visting this sub-forum and I am actually not a regular reader, hence my question :

Are e-books actually more expensive than "real" books? I've seen the amazon "email" to  the e-book publishers that they are overcharging. 

I need someone, who actually reads alot, to confirm if e-books are generally more expensive than real books or not. 

thank you in advance ;D 3 </TEXT>
