	<TEXT>  So if you're someone like me that just wants to hold, is there anything I have to do to prepare for this? Like, when the hard fork happens will I have to convert my coins to another chain or something, or do I just wait for everything to resolve itself?

If you hold your own private keys, there's really not much to worry about, except maybe keeping close track of any hardforks so you don't accidentally spend on only one chain right after a fork happens and before you realize that the fork has happened.

If you keep your coins on an exchange (e.g. don't hold your own private keys), you are at the mercy of that exchange, though most *reputable* exchanges shouldn't screw you over.

When ETH split into ETC and ETH, the reputable exchanges allowed their customers to withdraw and/or trade their ETC balance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Regardless of what we might think is ethically required, hardforks have a technical requirement of nearly 100% acting in their favour for deployment to be successful. If there are sufficient dissenters to constitute an economy of their own, the original Bitcoin will continue working, and therefore the altcoin proposed to be a hardfork will fail to replace it.

What planet do you live on? You don't get to redefine words to mean whatever you want, not in uncensored forums at least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Venezuela it is.

Bitcoin mining is only unaffordable in places with high or normal electricity costs.

The Venezuelan government subsidizes electricity to the point of it almost being free, so Bitcoin mining is highly profitable, if you have access to electricity.

http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/04/venezuelas-electricity-crisis-is-the-result-of-its-economic-success/479001/

It also helps that the government there has destroyed their economy and the Venezuelan Bolivar is rapidly becoming more and more worthless (800% cpi inflation in 2016)

	<TEXT> BU the client? No, it's a piece of software.

What results from what miners and nodes choose to do with that software? Well, BU allows creation of larger blocks, which, if acted upon, would result in two incompatible blockchains if people kept mining on the 1MB max blockchain.

So, BU *could* allow a hard fork to happen.

And to get away from strict facts now, I can't wait! We need more transaction capacity 6 months ago and I'm not against layer 2 solutions, but we need onchain scaling now and corrupt/toxic Blockstream-Core has tarnished any and all credibility they once had. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The more nodes with unique public IP addresses, the better.

Though if you're behind a NAT without port forwarding, it's never a bad thing to have a full copy of the blockchain, but it's not really directly helping the network either.

You could get a VPN and tunnel a full node through the VPN.

https://www.privacytools.io/#vpn

VPSs are great too to set up lots of different full nodes.

	<TEXT> According to https://bitcoinfees.21.co/

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 200 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.

For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 45,200 satoshis.

So assuming your transaction is around 226 bytes and not really sure what is considered reasonable, I'd say about 0.00040000 BTC for a fee. </TEXT>

Does Electrum show the balance back in your wallet?

If not:

First, try https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ if they aren't full and they can still see your transaction.

If that doesn't work, if you control any of the output addresses, make a new transaction from one of the output addresses with a MUCH higher fee to encourage a miner to pickup both transactions.

Sorry for the wait.

https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ is also a good site for checking fees going forward. </TEXT>

Blockexplorer likely still has the transaction in its mempool while the others do not.

Unconfirmed transactions can sort of float around the network and some nodes will drop them and/or rebroadcast them before others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be specific, a new transaction from 1M9u2WwcQmPnycLzWe6dirvwPNp583wtiA. Assuming that this new transaction is also about 192 to 260 bytes in size, I think a fee of 0.00100000 BTC would be enough to get them both confirmed as that would work out to about 0.00050000 for each of them.

https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ currently recommends a fee of 0.00049720 BTC for a 226 byte transaction, so I would *think* 0.00100000 will be enough.

If you try it, let us know if it works. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If a miner has greater than 50% of the total global hashpower, they can effectively control what transactions do or do not get put into the Bitcoin blockchain.

And as a miner were to start moving closer and closer to 100% of the total global hashpower, they would gain greater and greater ability to undo recent transactions that other miners had put into the blockchain.

Something like this could seriously damage people's faith in Bitcoin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Ah yes! That was their name. Thanks, that was kinda bugging me. Also thanks for the info, I'm glad to see things are getting a bit more diversified. Although, you can still see how a handful of guys could collaborate to manipulate the network. It's not even remotely out of the realm of possibly.

No problem! It's definitely within the realm of possibility, though it is worth noting that AntPool and F2Pool are both mining pools that miners could join or leave at any time.

 On a slightly related note, what happened to GHash.io?

No idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough, sorry to see you go.

I disagree strongly with your thoughts on Bitcoin, but have never had any problem with you as a moderator and appreciate you taking the time to moderate, even if light-handedly.

I also appreciate that you are not repeating the mantra of downvotes=censorship.

I realize downvotes are still an issue, but when I hear someone say downvotes=censorship, this indicates to me that this person could have better critical thinking skills or may be disingenuous, so again, thank you.

I think what's happened here is what naturally happens when people try to route around censorship. And it's not just a r\Bitcoin vs r/btc thing.

Without getting too specific, I think that r/btc has become an echo chamber for a particular faction that was censored in r\Bitcoin, just as Voat.co has become an echo chamber for a different particular faction that was censored on Reddit.com.

Thanks again for the moderation and the dialogue and sorry to see you go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So you do agree with it now? Really?

 Most people haven't noticed it here, but the moderation on /r/bitcoin has lightened up substantially over time. Not saying it's not a moderated forum, it is, but they let people talk both points of view over there enough that the conversations seem more productive to me.

Your submission was incredibly reasonable and much appreciated.

This, however, is just plain delusional. </TEXT>
