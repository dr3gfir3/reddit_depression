	<TEXT> Oh man you caught me. I work for Fallout's PR team and we thought, you know what would really boost sales? If we wrote a post on a non-gaming subreddit and then later wrote a follow up post that made one cursorial mention of our product. In fact, since we, the team of 70 people who wrote this post, made this, we've seen sales increase 600%!

You have elevated cynicism to an art form, man. </TEXT>
