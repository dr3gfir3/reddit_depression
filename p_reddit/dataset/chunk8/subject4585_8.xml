	<TEXT> The thing that makes kurapikas ability so strong is because if he is able to get red eyes during training in theory he could make a totally new nen ability that uses as many types as he wants but can only use it when he has red eyes. The ability to make an ability using all types in of itself is incredibly dangerous when people can train like netero and get that strong. Limitless possibilities  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why would togashi make ging use an ability very close to leorios after talking about leorios ability and it not be it? That would just be extremely bad writing. I think it's safe to assume that entire dialogue and action was to help give the reader an understanding on leorios ability. It's set up perfectly for that. Although technically you're right that there's no proof it can phase through. Except I'm pretty sure ging used warp punch and that was meant to give us proof he can warp through things. Him using it is the proof and the evidence that he used it is all context clues so I don't have scientific proof so we can just agree to disagree  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also if nen guard were to block something it would be the nen sonar because he sends out nen to use sonar so IF nen guard blocks something that would be it. Also he can obviously warp past walls because there's no point in him making and using sonar if he has to see in order to send the warp there </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't have to punch? Ging said the ability was most likely for cutting tumors out using nen emission. What ging emits doesn't matter. The warping is the main part of the ability not the punch. With the context of him talking about the ability and then using something that warps an emmision to the other side mixed with leorios sonar it would be extremely bad writing if that Wasn't a version of warp punch. All context clues lead to it being a variation of warp punch. If you don't think it's warp punch then I think you have to be in denial because there would be no reason for it not to be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How is what he using not warp punch? He used leorios nen sonar and then an emission of nen warped to where he wanted using the sonar. We have no reason to think it's not warp punch? Also you're right, we aren't aware of whether or not nen guarding keeps the sonar out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the thing is that it doesn't matter if the see leorio or not. As long as the person is at range then leorio can hit them before they hit him. Also someone would never use nen to guard their organs so that has no affect on the punch. Also ging did use warp punch but he warped an emission attack. Look at the manga panel again and you'll see he didn't break through the wall he warped the blast to the other side which would mean you can warp inside things such as the human body.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What are some underestimated hatsu? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-03 17:05:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My answer to this is 100% warp punch which I see being in the top 5 strongest hatsus we've seen so far in the manga.  This ability uses sonar to detect people and then detect clots, tumors or anything in the body they need to get rid of. Then he just sends a small blast in that place to get rid of the issue. We know this is most likely what the hatsu was meant for from ging. However in fights this is equally strong since using sonar it doesn't matter how fast you are if you're touching the ground then leorio can hit you with emission nen inside your body where you can't defend using ren. This move is an instant kill against anyone who doesn't know it's flying weakness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing I love to do is workout high. Being so aware of my body when I'm high mixes incredibly with the burns and pulls on the muscles during working out. For Christmas I got C4 but I'm scared to use it when high because both weed and pre workout affects the heart. Could this be dangerous or is it perfectly fine? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm of the very few people who put leorio above gon. Leorio should be based on time training is at the level of Gon and Killua during the middle of greed island. But that's with basic nen mastery not hatsu. Leorio is mediocre when it comes to shu,KO,zetsu and those types of things but his hatsu is godly. Think of it this way. Warp punch isn't meant to be a punch but rather to be used as a way to find tumors and blood clots(stated by ging) and then destroy them without cutting someone open. This means that leorio doesn't need to see to warp and he can warp anywhere in a body. Warp punch can be used to take out anyone from the inside and there is nothing they can do. I put leorio over gon because the difference in their hatsus </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She stated in front of my mother and other teachers she thinks I might have undiagnosed Tourettes. Basically this was 8th grade and memes had recently become main stream. I would make jokes that referenced memes such as the "aliens" meme from the history channel. Basically she was an older lady and didn't understand why I was saying certain things during class. She called a teacher conference about this. All my other teachers issues had to do with some talking and not focusing, normal stuff. Once she said this none of the other teachers agreed. I was at the brink of tears because to my dumb middle school self she said I was retarded  </TEXT>
