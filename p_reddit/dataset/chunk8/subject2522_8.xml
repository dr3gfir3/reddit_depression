	<TEXT> Have you been paying attention to this election? The rise of Donald Trump has shown it isn't a small fringe. The Republicans have many  more tactics than literacy tests and poll taxes to suppress the vote. Rather than increase minority  outreach, they choose to make it harder to vote. The religious conservatives would have a pretty good chance of pulling a good portion of the black vote if the GOP wasn't such a white men's club.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The world is certainly not awful. 

(1) Accusations against Russia. Of course Russia should be called out and be attacked in return. Anything less is weakness and cowardice that will diminish US standing on the world stage. If we can't even defend ourselves against a state as weak as Russia, what would that make China think, let alone the rest of the world? In your view we should just let other nations walk all over US interests and oh yeah its cool if they interfere with our domestic politics too.

(2)No fly zone. This is a test of wills and about increasing the costs of Russian involvement. Nothing going on the in the world happens in a vacuum. Everything is related. EVERYTHING. US actions in Syria have numerous aims. One is to end the humanitarian crisis to alleviate the flow of refugees into Europe. The other is to make it painfully costly for Russia to remain involved in Syria. They are taking a lot more risk and have a lot more to lose. Part of this reasoning is pay back for previous US failings, such as Georgia and Ukraine. We can't punish them there, but in Syria we have that opportunity. Pushing the no fly zone is like playing a game of chicken. First one to pull back loses. This is exactly what the Cuban Missile Crisis was. Russian geopolitics have always been rather masculine and chauvinistic. Each action Putin takes serves as a test for how much farther he can go next time. Blink and we fall down.

(3) No one ever wants to go to war. That is just putting all of your fear and hatred into a person to accuse someone of that.

(4) What has she been lying about in the context of what you are talking about? You are not making sense. 

(5) Uranium. So now there was no Obama in the White House? Clinton completely ran all foreign policy and national security decisions? There is no NSC? You have no idea how these decisions are made. They are collective with the final sign off by the president. Especially, something as sensitive as this. 

(6) Assad. The Assad regime is dead regardless. Syria is destroyed and will never recover to what it was. Assad has no legitimacy to govern outside his narrow coastal holdings. I'm not arguing for the toppling of Assad, but the only viable solution I see is the Balkanization of Syria, where Assad can remain in power in the coastal territories where he still has support.

Get your head out of your ass and try to understand how the world works and how our government makes decisions instead of making Clinton out to be some evil boogeyman.  </TEXT>

There is no racism because being from either city isn't related to race, ethnicity or anything but residency. If a candidate said they other candidate wasn't suited for office solely because of their race/religion/skin color/etc. then that would be prejudice in the form of racism.

	<TEXT> Buddy, it is about respect. If someone called me a different race and said I couldn't do a job or should be treated differently because of it then of course I'm going to be offended. Racism is offensive. You feel offended when people are racist. That is exactly what happened here. Just because racism isn't as openly hateful and vitriolic as during the civil rights movement doesn't mean it isn't happening. Racism takes a much more nuanced tone these days so people can sweep it under the rug. 

Racism is treating someone differently specifically because of their race or ethnicity and that covers a wide range of actions and words.  </TEXT>

Here is one from the end of August, still not going to give a total picture of the OP, but while it does show something similar the way they are taking money back from the state parties, it is to free up more money for tight races around the country. Races where Dems have a good chance of winning and more resources will make a difference.

I also don't think there are enough 'crazy' Trump supporters to cause anything too bad. It will be important to watch the statements that come out of the Republican Party post-election to see if they plan on adjusting their message or platform. 2018 will be a big turning point. Will the Republicans be so damaged as to underperform in the midterms? Can the Democrats build voter turnout from this Presidential election into something for the midterms. Can this election be used as a lesson for voter turnout?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, but it is just the start of shifting the message of the Democratic party. If that shift takes places and Democrats can keep posting wins that means this country's political center has moved left. Which helps more candidates like Sanders win seats. If the Dems shift left and start losing elections again they are in the position they were in before Bill Clinton whole helped move the Democratic Party to the right and closer to the political center. Clinton is going to have to compromise quite a bit to move things left. As long as the left wing Dems are willing to play the long game they can be successful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think there is anything he could get from China. China is pushing bilateral talks because they have all the cards then. Think of it like the relationship between managers and workers. Managers have all the cards and can control their workers individually, but through collective action workers gain a stronger hand and can actually gain concessions from the managers. This was not a smart move on Duterte's part. The US cannot acquiesce without looking very week and setting a terrible precedent for other weak allies, such as Pakistan. If Duterte knew what he was doing he would have threatened these actions in back channels and slowly pulled them out one by one to show he is serious. Playing all your cards at once is foolish. By pulling out of all military relationships with the US, he no longer has any negotiating room with China.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never said I looked with particular depth, but thank you for sharing that with me. It is a great example of the disconnect between how we identify ourselves and how others try to identify us. You understand how frustrating it can be. I wholeheartedly agree with you about the military. 

I never said I support separating communities and I never would. But the fact is communities are separated and we must understand why. Only then will the barriers start to break down. 

The only way we do that is through our public institutions. The military is a great example of this working but very few Americans will join the military. Our public schools used to be the great equalizer. They were responsible for uniting all the various European immigrants and instilling American values in a new generation. It wasn't long ago when Irish, Italian, and other Catholic immigrants were discriminated against. But our schools forced the children to see eachother as peers, as equals.  However, education funding has been withering. This is causing significant segregation of children into private charter schools. Not giving parents a choice forces students to interact with people they might not otherwise. This is one reason I am very against homeschooling. Primary and secondary school is as much about the information you learn as it is about social interactions. We just need to fund our schools better, pay our teachers more to attract better talent, and provide strong support for students whose home environment isn't academically supportive. 

Ben Carson is a great example of what the American Dream is about, but it was because his mother emphasized education so much.  We shouldn't punish children whose parents don't value education. Public education should be about preparing students to succeed in any opportunity they choose, regardless of their socioeconomic background and their home environment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It won't do anyone any good by being insulting. Doing so neglects the content of the argument and shuts down dialogue.

What I am saying is if you are refusing to engage and understand the perspective of others you are more detrimental to the discussion than anything. I can feel the emotion in your words and you need to be able to set that aside. You so far have refused to actually engage and that is really trying my patience. 

I teach a faculty certification course. Essentially, it is a course that teaches PhD students and post-docs how to teach, such as design a syllabus, write a lesson plan, and foster a strong learning environment. Things that a professor rarely learns before they are thrown into teaching. Social justice is important and using it in a derogatory manner doesn't help make your point in any way whatsoever. It is important for a teacher to understand the diversity of the students they will be teaching to foster an engaging learning environment. This covers a range of topics from the concerns of international students to the LGBT community, to students with learning or physical disabilities. It is about balancing accommodation and assimilation. Why should we force everyone to assimilate? We can all be equal without being the same. We just need to understand and respect each other and our differences. 

When teaching international students you need to be cognizant of your vocabulary, the rate of which you speak, and your use of idioms. Americans love idioms, but their meaning is cultural bound. An international student can have great command of the language without the cultural context. This is like not being able to understand British slang. Being aware of these also helps students with processing disabilities. These people are just as smart, it just takes them a little longer to make the same conclusions or process what has been said. 

It is also important to be aware of other disadvantaged communities. Frequently, we find black students do not feel a part of the campus community in the same way white students do. In fact, many minority communities feel this way. One reason is something called microagressions. These are seemingly innocuous statements that actually challenge a persons sense of self. One example would be asking an Asian-American where they are *really* from after they tell you they are from Kentucky. Because I think it helps here are a few more visual examples. [\[1\]](http://i.imgur.com/K8lJwQK.jpg)[\[2\]](http://i.imgur.com/Sa3AWKl.jpg)[\[3\]](http://i.imgur.com/LnZ2tOm.jpg)[\[4\]](http://i.imgur.com/pqlYgNr.jpg)[\[5\]](http://i.imgur.com/CBXJwh8.png) This is important because when we enter a new situation we ask ourselves two questions: (1) Do I belong here? and (2) Can I succeed here? The answers should always be yes to both, but frequently the actions and words of white students make them feel differently. 

So a brief perusal of your comments gives me confidence in my prior assumptions. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but you say you have a Polish wife, you're a veteran, you own a $400k house, have a Master's in Engineering, and finally "I'm 100% white European background." 

Please take a look at some of the links I posted for you. It is super important that you expose yourself to the perspectives of people that have vastly different life experiences than yourself.

	<TEXT> You are speaking for a group you are not apart of. You do not understand the intense discriminatory pressures on these communities. These assignments actually work quite well. I use them in the classes where I teach graduate students and post-docs how to teach. It is about understanding and accepting everyone's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has the same experiences you do and it is naive to think they perceive the world as you do. 90% of what you see is behind your eyes.

This is not saying anyone is superior. You are just being willfully ignorant at this point. Privilege is a result of culture. Privilege is not some absolute measuring stick. It means you are treated differently by society not because of who you are but because of what you are. Every group in the US is confronted with having to think about their race every day...except white people. That is the point. Think about how you identify yourself. If you really actually care about this stuff and truly ending racism not just sweeping it under the rug, you need to educate yourself. It is very uncomfortable and unpleasant to be forced to think about these things. That's undeniable. But we have to do it if we are to understand our fellow Americans. It is the only way we can understand what they are going through, so that we can be more than just sympathetic to them and actually be empathetic. 

If you are interested in these topics you need to immerse yourself. I don't care if you wind up hating these concepts and completely disagreeing with me, but if you don't even try you cannot claim to be part of the solution.

Only by understanding can we move forward and solve the problems. You can't just ignore it and hope that it goes away.

Some people have progressed through life without much challenge while others have had to fight and struggle while barely making any progress. Who are you to control people's thoughts and feelings? Why can you not accept people for who they are instead of what they are?    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue isn't the difficulty of suing. It is that people can sue at all. The government of a country has what's called sovereign immunity. This basically means a government can act in the interest of its country and people even if that means harming another nation and its people. If the US, the strongest country in the world, declares sovereign immunity null and void then there is nothing to stop other countries from passing similar laws and their citizens suing the US government. The list of possible countries would be staggering. Just to name a few you would have Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Russia, and Japan. Literally any harmful action our government takes could be used as a reason to sue us. That includes economic sanctions and military action.  </TEXT>

There are a variety of valid reasons why a business should be able to receive tax relief while they recover. Overall, it will give a company more cash for growth.

	<TEXT> I like how you are using an article in a section of the BBC entitled Echo Chamber. That's pretty rich. The problem isn't that elites have implicit control in US politics, it's that the average voter doesn't voice their concerns either by not voting or blindly voting for a party because they are single issue voters. 

The problem lies in the average voter not the elite or the system. An oligarchy implies that the rich control the ballot box, which is false. The rich tend to control the narrative, but an engaged voter can see past it. Elections are influenced by spending money to persuade voters, not buy voters. 

Are you actually engaged in the system? Do you vote in EVERY election? If not, you are part of the problem. Money sways local elections much more easily than national elections. Engage with your local officials, your Representative, and all of your elected officials. If you write them or call them they will respond. If you get your fellow constituents together you can influence your own officials. The problem with big money is that they can spend money to organize people in multiple places around the country at once. It starts and ends with the voter and always has. That means it starts with you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What place do you think the US should have in the world? Us supremacy is the reason the Cold War ended without a nuclear holocaust. US strength and unwavering commitment to our allies in Europe is the reason Europe has been the most peaceful it has ever been. Do you seriously think we would not be dragged into a war should Russia invaded the Baltic States? Our commitment acts as a deterrent. Trump's comments are a blank check to Russia to do whatever it pleases without consequences. 

On Ukraine, we did in fact have a.treaty obligation to defend the sovereignty of their territorial integrity as outlined in the Budapest Memorandum. The UK, Russia, and the US promised to respect and uphold the territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for removing the nuclear missiles in Ukrainian territory. Russia's actions have decimated the integrity of non-proliferation actions. What assurances could we possibly offer Iran or N. Korea now when we have shown we will not honor such agreements. Your focus is narrow, selfish, and frankly ignorant of the issues in global diplomacy. None of these actions are single events. They have long term consequences in shaping the norms and actions of nations in the future.  The US needs to protect its interests and fulfilling our obligations is central to that goal. 

Edit: a word and punctuation.
