	<TEXT> I could see the note being an icebreaker...the catalyst that begins a conversation.  And in a society where men are, generally speaking, taught that displays of emotion and openness are frowned upon, it is progress, and that makes me feel like there's hope for us yet (as a species)

	<TEXT> I'm 47, been using/abusing meth now since my early twenties.  I can honestly say that 4 day binges and psychotic episodes are days gone by, and omg I use more now than I ever have; 'high'? Its about maintenance now.  Fun?  I guess, because alternately, for example, being w/o it is like falling into a very deep well; and that hell is, well, hell.  
I feel sick almost all the fucking time now.  I have become used to it. I don't have people around me that are psychotic, either.  (We all find out who amongst us can't handle their shit at the same time).  My habit does not help diminish my PTSD.  (I'm a smoker).
   Why am I saying this?  Do I have a point?  Not really.  Just felt like jumping in.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> s'aight, note my username (lol) I ramble on sometimes...I myself prefer simpler, more traditional cards but with a twist of abstract....Karma Music and The Hermetic are my two go-to decks. I have collected definitions from nearly every deck I've come across for three decades, and of course I find it interesting to see this on video...never thought of that.   
And, MOCK READINGS!!!  they help you learn the cards and their patterns.  Notice when cards preceding/following affect the meanings...with the definitions of each card, I also include these combinations to look for....say, for example, really any 4 card (especially reversed) combined with The Chariot means stalking.  If the third card were to be the 7 of Swords, I would certainly analyze my relationships to see who is out to get me. 
Finding the definitions for combinations written down is not commonly found, but something I have found tremendously useful. </TEXT>
