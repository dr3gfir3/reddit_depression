	<TEXT> That's pathetic. See below for the real story. So many of you are looking so desperately for a hero that you overlook the truth. The crew used this girl and ordered her to stay behind, with others. And ypu applaud that she dies while they survived. Are you a Christian, perhaps? 

This is not an isolated event. Some are asked to sacrifice their lives while others survive at their expense. Teach your kids to fight for their lives,  not to obey orders while someone walks all over them.

	<TEXT> You'll feel bad for her and she'll be alive. Evolution selects for people like me and filters you out. Protecting your children is the most fundamental instinct and you lack it. Even lower animals have it. You'd rather protect someone else's child. Pathetic. Slave mentality. Don't reproduce. </TEXT>
