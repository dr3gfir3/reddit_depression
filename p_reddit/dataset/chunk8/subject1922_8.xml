	<TEXT> Sometimes they do have legitimate grievances but they also have people who blame Islam for things that have nothing to do with Islam. I used to visit the sub in the past when I expected it to be like a supportive sub for ex-Muslims and how to deal with leaving Islam and the struggles involved. Topics like, how to deal with Muslim family members, what to do during Ramadan, or discussions about meetups or moving on to living a secular life. There were a few topics like that on there, but it was mostly just complaining about Islam or what some Muslims do. I don't know if that sub has changed now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Ahmadiyya group makes an effort to interpret Islam to appeal to the opinions of modern society and to progressive values.  So far example, they will denounce all Jihad and commonly quote "Love for All, Hatred for None" even though Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote a lot of hateful stuff about the Christian community during his time. They will also interpret Quran ayat very differently and ignore all hadith which goes against their beliefs.  What they also don't tell you is all the bizarre things their prophet has said. [Here are some quotes from just one book.](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1vltgo/some_questions_for_the_ahmadiyya_community/)

[Update 2:](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/13/nyregion/1-killed-in-shooting-outside-mosque-in-queens.html)  Hundreds of Ozone Park residents are rallying right now at the crime scene in Ozone Park, demanding justice. Some of the locals believe it was a hate crime due to recent Islamophobia, but the motive is not yet known. Cops and witnesses described the shooter as tall and Hispanic, carrying a large handgun, and wearing a dark blue shirt and short pants. </TEXT>

It can be counterproductive to post emotional incidents like this repeatedly and give no avenue for people to do anything about it. I'm not talking about this story in particular, but when you have stories of oppression repeatedly shown to people, then this can cause people to become depressed or enraged, which is not good. This is also how some people fall into extremism, justifying harming other innocent people on the opposing side.   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-07-02 21:39:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm noticing 2 common types of news topics posted in this sub, but they often go without any benefit: 

1. "Muslim victim" articles

2. "Muslim did something wrong" articles

Regarding the first category, Muslims are oppressed every single day all over the world. So why post specific incidents of Muslims getting hurt in this sub? How about we do something about it instead of getting angry and emotional over it?  If the incident is local, try to see if you can do something beneficial about it, perhaps contact the media, proper authorities, or Muslims groups. Do what you can do in your area to prevent such things from happening again. Muslims already know about the oppression we go through, but non-Muslims may not know about it. So post the story to /r/worldnews  or /r/news  or other subs so that non-Muslims can also be aware of the level of Islamophobia that's going on, or try to raise awareness in some other way.

For the second category, it can be important to address news articles that are popular in current events in which Muslims engaged in some bad activity. We can explain how the action of the perpetrator is against Islam in a clear and precise manner. If this is common mistake done by Muslims, then we can discuss on how to prevent it from happening again. Sometimes we also have be careful not to jump to conclusions and backbite, keeping in mind that it's very possible that important details might have been left out and that we don't know the full story.

My point is that we should be productive about our posts, rather than simply react and be emotional about it. Thoughts? </TEXT>

All 4 major schools of thought presented what made sense to them based on textual evidence and their own reasoning,  and i think they all allowed shark. Although you may want to avoid shark today due to it being endangered.  Allah knows best. </TEXT>

You're 20 years old now, having conversations with people who disagree with you is part of life. You'll likely talk to an Imam or someone more knowledgeable about Islam than your parents. What do you honestly think is going to happen if you disagree? Have a sincere conversation with the person, listen to what they have to say and explain why you don't believe in Islam.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Uhh ok. Because "go and" makes all the difference when it comes to "kill ahmadis", a group which has been killed time and time again without justice being met.

It didn't say to "kill ahmadis" either. The only thing the leaflet commanded was to not socialize with Ahmadi's (which i don't support). It's just another exaggeration by these Ahmadiyya articles to say that the leaflets were commanding Muslims to go and kill Ahmadis.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In that case, then the original article is just as baseless because it comes from an anti-Ahmadi guy.

Anyone who disagrees with Ahmadiyya or talks about how it's wrong is labeled "anti-ahmadiyya". This is how my questions were first dismissed when i asked at /r/ahmadiyya and my posts were removed. 

 Additionally, Akber's statements in this article are alarming because he said that there is nothing illegal in a leaflet that clearly says, "kill Ahmadis".

And he's right. Not that i agree with the leaflets, but it doesn't say that you should "go and kill ahmadis".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're posting from an ahmadi-apologist news source which predictably uses the same rhetoric to dismiss any fault from the Ahmadiyya leadership.   It even starts off in their first point with a typical character-assassination attack, to weaken Akber Chaudry's point. The author is supposedly linked to Khatme Nabuwwat which supposedly sent out a "go out and kill Ahmadis" leaflet, which wasn't even true.
