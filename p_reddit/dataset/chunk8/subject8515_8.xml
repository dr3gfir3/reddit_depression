	<TEXT> I really enjoyed it overall but I don't think it's the untouchable masterpiece some are making it out to be. The pacing is a bit off and the film feels slightly uneven as a whole. Still, great original music and relatable, interesting characters elevated it significantly. B+ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, so in my mind, there's the first run that you do, and then it asks you if you want to do a victory lap. When you select yes, the "second playthrough" as you called it, or the *first lap* as I called it, starts. </TEXT>

On my second lap, I did get the ZIP! achievement, but I think that's because I finished the run in under fifteen minutes, which isn't specific to the fact that it was a victory lap. I also got the Once More With Feeling! achievement upon completing the first lap, I'm assuming you did as well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The main reason I'm upset is because we had to wait a lot longer for AB+ than we did for AB, but it's so much lamer in comparison. If this had come out three months after Afterbirth, I'd be okay with it, but when it took less than a year for Afterbirth to come out and this took *more* than a year, the lack of quality is a lot less forgivable.

I agree, though, it's not a massive deal and there's no reason the devs should be getting death threats.

EDIT: Jesus fuck, why all the downvotes? I think my explanation of why I'm disappointed in AB+ is perfectly reasonable. Am I supposed to clarify that I was referring to AB+ taking more than a year *after the release of Afterbirth*, not Rebirth? I thought that was obvious, but maybe not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the "Victory Lap" feature. Anytime you beat The Lamb, it will ask you if you want to do it. You can do multiple Victory Laps in a row, but the runs get harder each time and you get turned into The Lost on the third lap.

Also, every time you start a new victory lap, make sure you quit and select "Continue", or else never-before-seen items that you pick up won't get added to your item catalog. I think it's a bug. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: Something you should know about doing a third victory lap </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-05 00:32:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So basically I was going to do at least five victory laps in a row, hoping to maybe get the "Five Nights at Mom's" achievement. But I died right at the start of my third victory lap because, spoiler alert, the game turned me into The Lost (which I had no way of knowing because I had Curse of the Unknown).

Not sure if it persists through the fourth victory lap and onward, if this applies with all characters (I was Apollyon), if it's always the third victory lap, etc. Also there seemed to be a glitch where not all of my items carried over from the original run and/or past victory laps.

And while we're on the subject: never-before-seen items picked up during a victory lap ONLY COUNT IF you quit out of the victory lap and select "Continue" at some point during the lap, BEFORE picking up the item. You have to do this every time a new victory lap starts. I'm pretty sure you can get completion marks without quitting out first, though.

Oh, and I still have no idea if doing five victory laps actually triggers the "Five Nights at Mom's" achievement, as it was just a guess. But apparently I don't get to find out today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once dreamed the exact layout of a church parking lot and a nearby field in Schenectady, New York several months before my family went on vacation to New York and attended church in that building. It was very different than any other parking lot I've ever seen and I had never been to that part of New York, but I dreamed every single detail. I was religious back then and assumed that God had sent me a vision just for fun. This thread made me think about it for the first time since becoming atheist and I have no idea what to make of it.

Another time, while hanging out in my living room, I heard a swelling electric noise, growing increasingly louder. I looked up and saw a crackling ball of green light growing next to the computer monitor across the room, and after a few seconds it disappeared with a loud popping sound. I was noticeably freaked out and my sister, who was sitting closer to the computer than I was, asked what was wrong. She hadn't heard a thing and didn't believe me until we tried turning the monitor on and it didn't work. We had to get a new one.

I guess it's also worth mentioning that I just barely watched The Matrix for the first time a couple nights ago, so the timing of this post and the number of weird stories in the comments are kind of freaking me out. </TEXT>

If I talked more slowly and passionately, even if I was actually being insincere, I would have people on the verge of tears. If I was just being my real self and explaining the gospel to them the way I would to a friend in a normal conversation, they were never interested.

The Spirit is supposed to testify of truth, but it only ever seemed to when I was emotionally manipulating people on purpose. It was impossible for me to ignore and was one of my first steps toward leaving. </TEXT>
