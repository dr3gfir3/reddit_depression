One day when the teacher left the room we ended up looking inside a cup on his desk to find that the trouble maker of the class/basically the whole school had a fucking laminated hall pass with his name on it to the office.  I guess he got tired of writing hall passes to send him to the office.

This was in his homeroom btw.

"Those comments though. Woke as fuck/s"

Why would you respond Goyum to that comment?  Hmm could it be that you are angry because you consider attacking the nazi and racial comments to be an attack on you and your beliefs because they are identical to those who made those comments.

The answer is clearly yes and your not fooling anyone.  </TEXT>
