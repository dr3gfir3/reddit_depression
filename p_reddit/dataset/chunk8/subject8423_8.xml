	<TEXT> Fair enough.  Keep in mind that many of these values are true for some sects and not for others.  Turn the other cheek, love the neighbor, and help the needy to name a few idioms.  Creationism has been thrown out by most baptists, according to my preacher uncle.  Many churches think tax breaks for the rich are unchristian, though that has more economic impact than social.  Most churches and church goers view addiction as the mental illness it is and help addicts accordingly.  Socialism (usually within the church), people will collect money or tithe an extra few dollars to help someone who has suffered a catastrophe or someone in economic hardship, and most churches are the town's soup kitchen, shelter, and foodpantry.  It's really weird seeing Christians be socially liberal in odd ways.  Even my liberal friends have problems with addiction being a mental illness or donating time and money to the needy, yet it's so much the norm in our local churches that you get odd looks if you're against it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difference is that Christianity has been modernizing, albeit slower than the rest of society.  If people took the bible as literal as some groups take the Quran, we would be protesting shrimp being next to the "Christian" foods in transit, or job interviews would involve washing your boss's feet.  Sounds stupid, right?  That's because interpreting ancient books literally is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am currently in the Bible Belt.  You sound terribly misinformed about politics here.  A majority of politicians from here are social conservatives, but not in favor of institutionalized religion.  Some Christian values line up with socially conservative values, but just as many don't.  Furthermore, the different sects of Christianity (baptist, evangelical, Pentecostal, etc) have different interpretations of the bible and have A mottled view of what parts of society are wrong and what isn't; and all of these, even the most bible-literal sects, pale in comparison to Sharia Law.  What's more, old-school republicans are in favor of smaller government above all else (do not intervene if the situation is able to order itself.). This key value runs in complete contrast of institutionalized religion.  No place on Earth, save North Korea, is anything like the hellholes where Sharia Law is state law. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said A primordial God is an elder God.

Is it in the same godly realm?  Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a chaos magician who studies gods, I am telling you, specifically, in magic, no one calls primordial gods elder gods. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "antediluvian gods " you're referring to the godly grouping of Pre-history Goss, which includes things from forgotten gods to nature gods to   Primal gods.

So your reasoning for calling a primordial God Ann elder God is because random people "call the older ones Elder?" Let's get fairies and demons in there too.

Also, calling someone a magician or a wizard? It's not one or the other, that's not how magic works. They're both. A primordial God is a primordial God and a member of the beings who existed before the universe. But that's not what you said. You said a primordial God is an elder God, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the higher echelons of gods Elder Gods, which means you'd call primal gods and nature gods, and other God Elder God too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's put forth two scenarios.

Scenario 1: an aware Jedi is getting shot at by a blaster bolt

Scenario 2: an aware Jedi is getting a punch thrown at his face.

First you have to look at the danger in both scenarios.  Scenario 1 has a lot more danger for the Jedi than scenario 2.  This danger will make a bigger and brighter impact on the the force.

Next let's look at the opponent.  A lot of people can be on the opposite end of scenario one; a droid, a soldier, or a slave could all pick up a blaster and make an attempt at the Jedi.  But for scenario 2, the only people you'd find throwing a punch is another force user or extremely well trained fighter.  For the other force user, he has his own physical augmentations and training to counter the precog (and actual counter-pre-cog for some) and while the highly trained person doesn't have the force, the Jedi is still a person who has to react.  If Tyson can throw 20 punched in a few seconds, some of them are going to hit.  And only Tyson-tier Melee fighters are going to go toe-to-toe with a Jedi.

Last, let's look at the outcome should the Jedi do nothing.  In scenario 2, the Jedi will get some broken teeth, a broken nose, and maybe end up on his back.  This would suck.  But for scenario 1, the Jedi's life could end.  These two different outcomes would look extremely different, with scenario 2 looking like a road sign and scenario 1 looking like a brightly light neon sign with flashlights neon letters and arrows around the sign, also flashing neon, pointing at it.

The force isn't true precognition, it's harder to read the more trivial the subject.

If a commodity stops selling well where it's cheap to ship (locally) but is still selling well where it costs more to ship (U.S.) then a company is more likely to move production closer to the profitable area to reduce shipping cost, which include tariffs and lost merchandise(damage, theft) as well as the cost to put it on a truck/plane and haul it elsewhere.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it's just an ugly language and its speakers have a bloody history.  The magic you saw was all Gandalf.  Gandalf is a Maiar of Manwe.  Manwe has power over the sky, air, winged creatures, speech, and will.  Gandalf, being an extension of Manwe, has the power of speech and will (and some minor stuff from other Ainur, Gandalf was a bit of a Mary-Sue as far as Maiar go).  To give an example, if I were to run out into my front yard and started screaming at the top of my lungs that I'm going to nuke Russia, I'd get weird looks and maybe the police called on me.  This is because I have little to no power.  Certainly not enough to nuke Russia.  Now imagine President Trump does the same.  He's in the middle of the White House lawn screaming about how he will nuke the Russians.  This has much more implication because Trump does have power, more than enough for his words to have an impact, whatever they are.

It's actually really cool when you view Gandalf's magic as his voice bending reality.  When he releases Theodin from thralldom, he just says "you are released" and it happens.  When facing down the Balrog, Gandalf was overpowered forcing the Balrog to not pass, so he told to bridge to not let him pass and the bridge listened and collapsed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MO's initiative has, sadly, been a giant flop.  Broad sweeping rules were instated for nuanced problems.  My wife is a teacher, so these are second-hand examples: bake sales are off-limits during lunch, students have to raise money elsewhere; school lunch quality is at an all-time low and the number of students getting a school lunch has dropped to a fraction it was before Obama, the only students who get school lunch are the ones who get it free or reduced, and not all reduced kids get it it's so bad; serving size is down, it's not uncommon for a reduced or free school lunch kid to get theirs and give it to someone else to have double lunches, or a normal portion size for a poor kid who doesn't get to eat often outside of school; waste is at an all time high, many kids won't eat thrice frozen green beans and purple mush that was once probably blueberries and just throw them in the trash.  

The fat kids just bring their own lunches that are double the size of an entire school lunch.  It's done wonders to show the class divide in my wife's school as the wealthy kids eat deli style sandwiches and quart sized containers of soups while the poor kids eat peanut butter sandwiches from home or the salty-red-sauce covered cardboard from school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, kinda.  I feel for the people in SEA working class families, but I have my own working class family to look after.  Their cost of living is lower than mine by orders of magnitude, so a "free trade" with their country would be devastating to my country because all corporations see is money.  It's cheaper to ship something across the ocean to America than to make it in America.  This hurts the American economy as a whole, despite being good for the corporation.  This is exactly what our government is supposed to do, protect its people.  Does America have a duty to protect human rights around the world?  No, I like that we do protect human rights but we by no means have to.  The SEA family can still find work without destroying American jobs and leaving me underemployed. </TEXT>

Not being able to go FTE keeps him from closing the gap between them and this is when Sasuke can use any number of abilities to just instantly end the fight.  </TEXT>

Fluctuations in weight, combined with poor musculature, will stretch all adipose tissue, especially free hanging breasts.  This would stretch the mammary tissue as well, leading to sagging armpits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, but Legolas is already a bullet timer in reaction time, and Geralt gets no prep in his fight against Legolas, and I doubt Legolas is going to let him cast any sort of spell or drink a potion in the middle of their fight.  Legolas and Gimli are the two members of the fellowship who don't aim to wound whatever they attack.  Any sort of bonus prep would afford Geralt would be useless when you add Aragorn, because Aragorn isn't a man, he's a Dunedane, part elven, and has his own slew of magical items that outclass Geralt's own.  I expect whatever sword Geralt is using to be bent or broken after clashing with Aragorn's own (Aragorn is above peak human in many attributes and abilities).  And while Geralt is faster than Aragorn, he's the same speed as Legolas with his potion, and Legolas is still very formidable in melee.  The two members of the fellowship beating down on Geralt would be too much.  He might wound one, maybe even fatally, but he won't win.  Also Aragorn can bring magical properties out of mundane plants thanks to the blessing of Yvanna, he would be able to heal any damage that isn't immediately fatal after Geralt dies.  And again, once you add Gimli, someone more skilled and wearing dwarf forged armor (dwarves make their items inherently magic as well). Geralt's chances become slim-to-none.  With Boromir, a "man" who was able to cleave through most of a mountain troll's arm in a single swing (middle earth men =\= men) it just becomes a slaughter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm afraid Geralt doesn't win a single round.  

First we have to establish that man =\= The Race of Men

The only round that isn't 9 or 10 out of 10 for Geralt losing is round one, and you put him against the strongest fighter in the fellowship.  Some of Legolas's feats include running on fresh snow without leaving a footprint;hitting a warg between its shoulder bone and thick neck fat, a space less than an inch across, from several hundred yards away; and the whole Elephant scene in Rotk.  I haven't watched the Hobbit to get more feats from there.  Then you have to realize that almost everything Legolas uses is magical.  The elven process of crafting imparts a part of their soul into everything they make, making all his gear supernaturally better than it would be if made by a man.  But then you have his quiver that allows him to grab any specific arrow naturally, his bow which is an old bow of royalty, and his cloak that hides him from all enemies.  I'd give this match up a 3/10 for Geralt.  But every round after this is a 0/10.  Aragorn isn't a fighter, he's a ranger, and is the worst off in a straight fight out of everyone save a Hobbit.  But Aragorn and Legolas fought multiple battles together and can work in a team flawlessly.  Once you add Gimli the fight is over in seconds.   </TEXT>

Manipulating the flow of blood in a person without stopping it would be a trivial thing to someone who is able to blood bend.

In the Android Saga, Yamcha was as strong as base Goku at the end of the Frieza saga.  Krillin is above Yamcha, but not by enough to matter for this logic train.  This puts Krillin stronger than third form Frieza and base Goku at the end of the saga, putting Krillin's power level above 3,000,000.

 In contrast, Vegeta During the Saiyan saga has a base power level of 18,000 and 180,000 in great ape form.  Krillin would destroy Vegeta.  Krillin would still destroy Vegeta at the end of the Namek saga who only was still weaker than Goku. </TEXT>
