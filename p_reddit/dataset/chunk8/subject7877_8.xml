	<TITLE> Thruxton Slip ons </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I recently took off my stock slip ons/silencers and am now running straight pipe on a 2009 Thruxton. Before this, I had my air box removal kit installed. So far she has only cut out once when I turned her on and tried to give her gas with a cold engine. Does anyone have any experience with this? Pros and cons to running straight pipe? Pro for sure is that she sounds great. </TEXT>
