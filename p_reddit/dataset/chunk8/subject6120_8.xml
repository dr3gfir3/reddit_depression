	<TEXT> Can you hire a lawyer to setup a trust with the insurance payout? The trust could then give her a monthly payout until it runs out. 

Alternatively after X years, the trust could award her the remaining amount. Make X long enough that she's close to retirement when it happens (20 - 25 years?) this way she would be older and hopefully be more mature.

I think your wife will need to work still but at the very least will have that minimum monthly income if she loses her job etc.

If you can: don't tell her how much she's about to receive. Uncertainty could make her be more conservative about money.

Good luck man. Whatever is left of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Politics is relationship, but I think past a certain point, that relationship should be extended to the constituents - not just to the people that could afford to walk and brush shoulder with those on power. 

Obama's (and I mean to include his administration) performance is phenomenal, especially given the shit show it got handed from the get go, but it is not perfect and immune to criticisms. In fact it should be criticized as it could serve as points to cover for the incoming administration --- but let's be honest with those criticisms, be factual, and be able to compare without bias against the plans and policies that Trump, et al., aims to bring online. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ever heard of the phrase: when the US gets a cold, the world gets the flu?

But even if we discount this point, complaining in the face of overall progressive results is just nit-picking (at the least) and outright misleading regarding Obama and his administration's performance - it's a caricature of the Asian parent finding fault after their kid brings home A's -- "This is not an A+, you've been slacking off, you're grounded!"

This economy and policies that have been put in place, it had barely paid off its dividends. But it has started paying off. T

To regress and overhaul just because it was what delivered by Obama and does not fall in line with the vision and plans of GOP and Trump's cronies is not just wasteful, it's downright retarded and irresponsible.

	<TEXT> That's your response? Look at the negatives? 

Obama's administration saved the world economy, improved American lives, and restored the world's faith in the US. This despite the obstruction thrown by the Republicans.

You're basically complaining about not being able to dunk this big fucking cookie that Obama somehow was able to hand over to you, into your warm glass of milk.

You can't possibly be that shortsighted. 

Now the US has Trump, and each one of those progress made is about to be reversed - and then some... maybe you could blame this fuckup on Obama... </TEXT>

But just look at the news, look at what he's doing now (what he's been doing during the campaigns), is this seriously someone you think would be competent or has enough integrity to follow through with his words to serve the people?

Look at this example: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-foundation-money-claims_us_58627534e4b0d9a59459096a - you could easily verify this yourself.

The terrible thing about this is not the lie. That's the least of it. The terrible thing is that this type of behavior isn't an exception for Trump, it's his normal. 

So back to my question: why Trump?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not assuming everyone who voted for Trump is white, dumb, and undereducated. Though it puzzles me why someone with a modicum of education would.

Serious question though: why Trump? 

Every rhetoric and actions he's done so far does not look like it would be to the benefit of people like you (or us) or the world itself. And if we're talking personality (say vs Hillary) Trump isn't exactly a good choice objectively. We're not even discussing fitness for office of POTUS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And Trump won despite being rotten, vulgar, a molester, etc., he's everything that would disqualify any candidate to the highest office - and yet... here we are.

Individuals are smart, but mobs are dumb and primal. Trump tapped the latter, but more by accident than strategy. </TEXT>

And yeah, the IRS don't fuck around. 

There should be forgiveness for personal tax debts at some point. I know people who lead miserable lives because of tax debts they couldn't pay in one go and ended up carrying over (interest and all) every year until the IRS started garnishing their wages. </TEXT>

Incidentally, the Philippine Board of Censors also wanted parts of SL to be cut out: the nude scenes at the camps.

Spielberg decided not to show it there, but then President Fidel Ramos stepped in and overrode the censors.

	<TEXT> Not saying it was fair.

But Gates was a relentless, single-minded, and effective player. A technocrat too boot. Jobs would have loved to be in that position then, and for a time he was when he came back to Apple. Ballmer just didn't have the taste (like Jobs did) or innate sense of tech (like Gates) which I think contributed to MSFTs stagnation in the early 00's

Post MSFT, Gates just changed focus. But he's still applying the same sense of purpose and will, but this time around to distributing back the billions he amassed in a very productive and effective way. 

Not something we can envision Jobs doing, nor Ballmer. So in the balance of things, if there is good and evil, I think Gayes falls in the former category. </TEXT>
