	<TEXT> I stumbled across this film while browsing my parents' "premium" channels when I was in middle school, and have been searching for it ever since. I remember it being a fairly hokey 90's-ish drama. The main character was a writer who is a witness in some sort of criminal court case.

I remember a specific scene where he is on the stand giving testimony about a crime he witnessed, and describes the defendant. The defense attorney scoffs at him, suggesting that no one's memory is that good. In an attempt discredit the him, the attorney turns around then asks him what color shirt and tie he has on. The main character proceeds to describe, Sherlock Holmes-style, the attorney's entire outfit, even commenting on the style of tie knot. He then smugly says that he can do this because he is a writer, or something dumb. He was kind of a douche.

Anyway he has sex with his wife and also has an affair and these were the most memorable/exquisite four boobs of my young life and they have eluded me for nearly two decades.
