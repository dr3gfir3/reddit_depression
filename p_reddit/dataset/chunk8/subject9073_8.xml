	<TEXT> Yeah... Multi-hyphenate isn't a badge of honor.

The reason people hate on Glover is because he's spread himself too thin. Rather than focus on one skill and being the best in that area, he is trying to "do it all" and turing out mediocre material in all areas.

The bottom line is, unless you've decided to be a super-fan of Glover, most people either don't know him at all or view him in these terms:

He's nowhere near the funniest comedian.

He's nowhere near the best actor.

He's almost completely unknown as a writer/producer (both of which are extremely easy titles to grab when you're an established entity in Hollywood, btw).

And he' not even close to the top 100 when it comes to the best MCs in the hip hop game.

It's just that simple... When people are handed bullshit, they see it as the bullshit it is. It's why J-Lo's career in Film suffered to the point where she barely has any significant film roles in the past decade. It's why Jamie Foxx flat out quit doing stand-up comedy. The typical fans of popular culture aren't interested in an above average guy who can do 5-6 things all right. They want to back a certified mega-star who is the best in his/her field.

Glover ain't it. He has peaked. </TEXT>

I guess I'm just wondering if there is any advantage to keeping my Bank of America account open. Does it look better on credit reports? Or is it actually a negative?

Are there ways I can use two checking accounts to my advantage? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's kind of a comeback.

Patton throws a lot of shade at other people on Twitter. He's a very very active tweeter. He says a lot of things publicly, and make his living as a celebrity.

So the idea that he was making a public remark and then somebody shut him downalbeit in a completely non sequitur fashion, with a total redirect on topicit could be considered a comeback.

I think we can all agree... It was SAVAGE as fuck.

Now, I'm now defending the guy. He's clearly a dick. That joke would have been cruel at a celebrity roast, let alone unprompted, out of nowhere on Twitter.

Eh... Maybe you're right. When I read it again it's just more of a sucker punch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Big up vote for articulating something I've been trying to say for a while, but had a hard time forming the words... Bray is great ion the mic, but never goes anywhere. No direction is the perfect way to sum it up.

He's always talking about how the other guy "doesn't understand what they're dealing with", etc. But everybody does seem to understand... He's a dark guy. We all get it. But what next??

The Undertaker (love him or hate him) always built his promos up to his signature "Rest... In... Peace." which the crowd loves. "Follow the Buzzards" just doesn't have the same iconic feel. I mean fuckthe crowd eats it up every time Big Caz spells out S-A-W-F-T... Bray just doesn't have whatever that "it" factor is that takes guys to the next level. </TEXT>

And the writers   bookers seem to be having a hard time giving him a serious, long-term push.

What could WWE do to make this guy bigger than he is right now?

	<TEXT> Holy shit, that's an awesome question.

I've lived all over... Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Florida, Connecticut, Arizona, California and Texas... So I've seen a little variety.

If rent/ownership was exactly the same everywhere in the USA, I might actually move to Key West, FL and stay there until I die of old age or get blown out to sea by a Hurricane.

I have no idea what the crime/homeless/traffic stats are for Key West, but it's South Florida, so I'm sure there are drugs-a-plenty. I lived in Miami for a year and there was a lot lot lot of crime and drugs and traffic (the 95 South between Fort Lauderdale and North Miami is horrendous).

All I really know is that I've visited there many times and it feels like Key West is a small paradise at the dick end of America.

I might also say something like Hawaii. But I would specifically want to live in the movie/tv show Hawaii... You know, the one that looks like the Garden of Eden in the Pacific. But I've also seen a lot of Dog the Bounty Hunter, and I don't want to live in that Hawaii. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Austin is actually 11th. ( -- don't you hate it when people on reddit nit-pick the details)

For serious though... Yes, I know. I mean, I didn't think I was coming to a crime free utopia, but comparatively speaking... Austin is safer on paper.

And now the big reveal (that nobody is actually waiting for)... I moved from #2. That's righthate me even more, I came from Los Angeles to Austin. I'm a walking clich.

I am not from LA. I grew up in Florida (again, please don't judge me too harshly), but I lived in LA for a decade. Here are some fun facts...

LA is even closer to Mexico/the Cartels/drugs, has the 2nd highest concentration of homeless per capita (after New York) and has literally the worst traffic in America... The traffic is so bad that LA is the only American city to make the global top 10 of the Most Traffic-Congested Cities. Not even New York made the World list.

None of this is bragging rights. I lived in LA for 10 years and steadily grew to hate it. Moving to Austin felt like a dream come true. And now, it seems, that me and all my fellow relocaters are bringing that dream to an end.

So even though Austin may have always seemed like a crime-ridden party-town to you guys... It looked very appealing to me when I came here 4 years ago. </TEXT>

I moved here from a much bigger city with a much larger homeless population where crimes like drug-related theft are so common that they're normal.

Statistically, Austin is a safer place. Which is one of the reasons I moved here.

Every year that I'm here, Austin reminds me more of the place I came from.

I guess growth and change are inevitable and I was just commenting on the fact that all successful cities end up having similar problems.

We don't care about chairs and walking. And we typically don't care about anything that happens and stops... It's just sustained noise over a long period of time that starts to wear me down. And of course, if it's a weeknight, it seems more annoying.

Technically... Quiet hours at our complex are 10PM to 10AM.

A little background; we live just outside of the UT Austin campus. We know that a lot of the tenants in our complex are college kids, and this includes our upstairs neighbor, who is a French girl of college age. My girlfriend and I are adults with adult jobs.

I don't want to have tension with a neighbor... I'm a hot head and I've yelled at neighbors in the past. It just makes things worse. I want to solve this peacefully... But my own temper worries me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have to agree with this.

I am not a hardcore fan by any stretch... But I would typically pay for 2 PPVs a year at $60 each.

Now, for $9.99/month (which is only $120 a year) I get all the PPVs plus a bunch of other stuff.

Great deal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those still in doubt, it was obviously a work. WWE wants very badly for everybody to start tuning into Talking Smack and this was a great way to generate interest.

I just wasn't buying it.

I mostly like The Miz, but the moment he tried to amp up the heat and start shouting "for real", all I could do was laugh.

How could anybody take him seriously?

	<TEXT> Agree with both of you, Basketsky and _Cotton_Teeth.

I guess that's where I ultimately land when I put any thought to it. I love so many of the movies/scenes listed in this thread, but none of them strike me as particularly "iconic".

When I think of iconic scenes, I think of things that not only broke the moldbut that also stood the test of time.

Maybe it's just a question of waiting... What scene mentioned here will really be remembered 20-50 years from now?

I mean... The Wizard of Oz has been very resilient. The Ben Hur with Charlton Heston. Kubrick films... But the scenes don't have to come from old movies necessarily. Even the Hoth/Walker sequence from Empire Strikes back, or the roof-top jump from Die Hard... These scenes were unbelievably fresh when they were first released, and then they remained at the top of the list. Fight Club and The Matrix (love them or hate them) were some of the last films that had anything really 'iconic' in them.

SIDE NOTE: Some might mention Avatar because of the revolutionary 3D. But I would say that Avatar has not stood the test of time very well, and will only be seen as iconic in the context of 3D films.

All of the scenes mentioned here are memorable and entertaining. But iconic status is top level shit.

I just think we're in a 10-20 year lull at the moment. Too many sequels and reboots and half-assed franchises. With so many rehashes, it's hard to do something that changes the game and stays relevant 40-50 years after it was made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not being snarky when I say this, but... NONE.

I'm not kidding.

I don't think any scene from any movie in the past 10 years will be remembered as iconic.

Hollywood hasn't produced anything groundbreaking and/or worthy of the history books since the late 90's.

And before everybody jumps on me... I like a lot of films from the past 10 years, I just don't think they hit the mark of "iconic". That's a pretty heavy word. </TEXT>
