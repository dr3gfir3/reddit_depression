The important thing is to rent to people who will actually live there, and not to travelers. There are too many areas where this is a problem.

	<TEXT> I consider fear of clowns a meme phobia. 

ETA: Check out the ngram viewer. There are pockets of fear in the mid-20th century, but it doesn't take off until at least 1975, which means the youngest Gen X'ers and oldest Millennials. The second wave of fear starts in about 1988, which is probably related to Stephen King's It, which was published in 1986. And now that it's an established thing, it perpetuates itself.

	<TEXT> Throughout. For example:

"Youre not looking for a job Doran" - there should be a comma before his name.

"Its a regular convenience store to Dorans dread." - should be a comma before "to." Or the sentence should be rewritten. Dread isn't really the right word here.

There was a lot of that, too, actually - the not quite right word. For example "freezing breeze." A breeze is mild and pleasant, not freezing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your sentence construction is awkward and there are too many pronouns that I don't know who or what they're referring too. 

The shacks "stood still." I don't know what that means. Shacks generally don't move around all that much. I thought it meant they "stood silent" until it turned out everyone was shouting.

They're shouting at a crowd that seems to not actually be there.

The "like acrimonious harpies" at the end of the sentence gets lost there.


"This was partially done out of interest" - what was done out of interest?
What homeless? Where'd they come from? Are they the crowd?

I kind of gave up after that. I was too frustrated.

I feel like this could be good if you tightened up the logic. </TEXT>
