	<TEXT> The article says some interesting things about National Security Advisor HR McMaster   Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.

McMaster:

McMaster has been a vocal proponent of protecting civilians in warzones and avoiding the clash of civilizations approach favored by Trump and his top advisers.

In a speech at the Carnegie Council in 2014, McMaster said that the United States must partner with people in Muslim-majority countries to defeat groups like Islamic State, describing them as the people who are suffering the most from terrorism. McMaster added that to win such conflicts,U.S. forces must understand the history and social dynamics of the countries it is fighting in, as well as have empathy for the people among whom these wars are fought.

McMaster has also criticized agenda-driven D.C. think tanks and foreign policy seemingly driven by the weapons industry. In a 2015 speech at the University of South Florida, McMaster said that the military-industrial complex may represent a greater threat to us than at any time in history.

Mattis

As the commander of the 1st Marine Division in Iraq, Mattis believed that treating Iraqis with respect was essential to American security. He investigated abuses of prisoners in Iraq and helped stop the use of torture at one prison where an Iraqi in U.S. detention had died after being beaten.

On the campaign trail, Trump advocated for the return of waterboarding. A short meeting with Mattis during the transition period in November had Trump reconsidering his stance. The president-elect told reporters that he asked Mattis about waterboarding, and Mattis replied that he never found it to be useful. Instead, Mattis told Trump: Ive always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture. Trump told reporters in January that he would defer to Mattis on the issue from now on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There were other concerns about the Snooper's Charter: 

The law will force internet providers to record every internet customer's top-level web history in real-time for up to a year, which can be accessed by numerous government departments; force companies to decrypt data on demand -- though the government has never been that clear on exactly how it forces foreign firms to do that that; and even disclose any new security features in products before they launch. 

Not only that, the law also gives the intelligence agencies the power to hack into computers and devices of citizens (known as equipment interference), although some protected professions -- such as journalists and medical staff -- are layered with marginally better protections.

	<TEXT> This is who you're saying we should trust (the organizer of the letter): 

MMTC, which [acts on the needs](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/31/big-telecom-funded-civil-rights-group-joins-lawsuit-block-net-neutrality-instantly-contradicts/) of telecom lobbyists, has been accused of [astroturf](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/?company=mmtc) lobbying by creating the appearance of grassroots support for the industry. [Source](https://theintercept.com/2017/02/13/naacp-trump-netneutrality/)

The "closing the digital divide" is literally one of Pai's talking points that is totally incongruous with what he did immediately upon entering office. In addition, Pai's stance on net neutrality is very very well known:

"On the day that the Title II [net neutrality] Order was adopted, I said that 'I dont know whether this plan will be vacated by a court, reversed by Congress, or overturned by a future Commission. But I do believe that its days are numbered,' [Source](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20161209/05240636229/fcc-commissioner-pai-says-net-neutralitys-days-are-numbered-under-trump.shtml)

And the rest of the Intercept article shows how these various civil rights groups have opposed net neutrality in the past. E.g., 

The NAACP, which signed letters opposing net neutrality both times the rule was proposed by the Obama administration, has named AT T, Verizon, and Comcast as corporate fundraising partners. After the NAACP endorsed Comcasts merger with NBC, Comcast disclosed that the NAACP was one of the the recipients of $1.8 billion in funds doled out to various community groups.

This is literally what you're defending. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly: 

But Kim Keenan, the president of MMTC, **the group that organized the joint letter, has showered Pai with praise. He is really focused on closing the digital divide.** As an advocate, I feel so much pride that that it is a priority for his chairmanship, Keenan told Multichannel News, a trade outlet.

That should immediately be a red flag if you have been following the developments at the FCC. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is NOT a friend to net neutrality.

Secondly,

They are criticizing the executive branch's tool for accomplishing net neutrality, asking for Congress to "lock in net neutrality." The danger is that Congress is largely controlled by politicians who do not like net neutrality, and may write a bill that sounds like they are saving net neutrality - even though they are actually killing it.

	<TEXT> In a little-noticed joint letter released last week, the NAACP, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, OCA (formerly known as the Organization for Chinese Americans), the National Urban League and other civil rights organizations sharply criticized the "jurisdictional and classification problems that plagued the last FCC"  a reference to the legal mechanism used by the Obama administration to accomplish net neutrality.

Instead of classifying broadband as a public utility, the letter states, open internet rules should be written by statute. What does that mean? It means the Republican-led Congress should take control of the process  the precise approach that is favored by industry.

None of the civil rights groups that signed the joint letter responded to a request for comment.

[...]

While advocating against net neutrality, the organizations on the joint letter have raked in money from the telecom industry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These kinds of discussions are what extremism is pulling us towards:

Some of the Left regard conservatives as Nazis, he writes: How does one deal with a Nazi  that is, with an enemy one is convinced intends your destruction? You dont compromise with him or leave him alone. You crush him.

The flip side of believing your enemies want to crush you because you are a Nazi is the belief that you must crush them first. So what do we have to lose by fighting back?

Right-wing extremists using left-wing extremists (ie the ones who resort to violence) to justify 'crushing enemies.' Meanwhile elites are refusing to acknowledge the realities staring at them in the face, whether it's global warming or dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party establishment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The rest of the article says that those shipments were cancelled under the justification that Saudi Arabia was using them to target civilians, hence the title.

Targeted bombing is **normally safer** for civilians than indiscriminate bombing. In fact, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during his confirmation hearing that the U.S. should provide Saudi Arabia with better targeting intelligence and better targeting capability in order to minimize collateral damage.

But the Obama administration, despite its reluctance to offend the Saudis, halted the guidance-systems sales after concluding that the Saudi-led coalition was **targeting civilians deliberately.** </TEXT>
