	<TEXT> I don't believe this was ever confirmed, but there are many who believe the creatures from 'Signs' are demons. It's not that water hurts them, but blessed or holy water. The little girl who leaves the water around the house has blessed it through touch. Later in the movie it says something about how people in Jerusalem or something found an ancient method of killing the creatures which is probably holy relics or blessed water.  

Also I've never believe for a second that Dad's weakness is water. If you'd remember in 'Unbreakable' the teacher tells David he frowned and died for 5 minutes. I think this actually activated his latent abilities. When he falls in the pool at the end he only believes he's screwed but we don't get to see if he'd actually drown. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for help and advice. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-23 21:28:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a 30 year old man living in Southern New England. I've worked in many jobs in my life but I'm not satisfied with the direction I'm heading in. I used to love remodeling my house with my father, and doing some play production in high school. After much consideration I decided that I wanted to become a carpenter.  

I tried to apply with the New England Carpenters union and made it through the interviews twice, only to be rejected. For the last year I've been applying to every helper position I could find but I'm not getting responses. I fear that employers see my age an believe that I'm going nowhere, and this is just another job. But that is not the case at all.  

I have no criminal record at all, and I can pass a drug test on a moments notice.. I'm just looking for some advice as to where I should be looking and applying, and to get started. I know I'm not going to make much money in the beginning but that's okay.  

Where did you get your start, and how can someone like me get into this career?  

Edit: I just wanted to let you guys know(if anyone cares) that I actually got a response from craigslist.  
I went and did a working interview in their shop and they decided to take me on! It's going to be a bit of a pay cut but I'm okay with it, because this is what I want to do.  
Thanks for everyone who responded.

	<TEXT> I'm from Massachusetts, about 50 minutes south of Boston and like 35 from Providence, RI. I don't live in a major city but I can think of 5 seperate theaters right now that are playing standard definition within a 30 minute drive for me. I'm sorry your having a hard time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People always post stuff in this sub like "150k hours into this game, just figured out daggers do extra damage with sneak". You claim to have been playing for 5 years and didn't know paralyze works on everything in the game except for dragons. So I asked what do you do when you play the game?   

I was being a bit of a duck, but I am really interested in how you play and what types of characters do you make. </TEXT>

I'm just not sure of what I should do or am even responsible for. </TEXT>
