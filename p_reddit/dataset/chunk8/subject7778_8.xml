	<TEXT> Zara, they have a topcoat that is just like one of the topcoats A$AP use.
I found it on vacation in Spain, so I don't know if it is in other countries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love this style. I have been slowly but surely filling my closets with these type of clothes. Only problem is that this style is very expensive :(

If anyone are looking for topcoats, go to ZARA. I bought one there, and it is probably the best thing I have ever used my money on. </TEXT>
