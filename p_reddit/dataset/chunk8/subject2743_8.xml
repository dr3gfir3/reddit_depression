	<TEXT> I recently reinstalled windows and C:S. When I logged back into Steam, all of the mods and asses I originally subscribed to all returned. As I have so many, is there any way to delete all mods and assets in one go? I know you can enable or disable all but I can only see the option of going through the Mod UI and deleting them all separately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just can't build good looking cities and it is annoying the hell out of me. I get to circa 80k cims and my city ends up looking completely grid-y no matter how much I try to plan it not to be. When I tyy to stay away from grids my traffic ends up a complete night mare.

I am going to start a whole new city with unlimited money/all unlocked and try and get all my infrastructure planned in advance. 

Any help or tips to keep my city feeling "real" would be gladly appreciated. </TEXT>
