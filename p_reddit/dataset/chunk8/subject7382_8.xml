	<TEXT> Yeah I had a hard time reading that rhetoric as well. Exhibit A would have to be how the Germans treated partisans on the eastern front. Essentially hitler created a decree by which if a partisan is behind enemy lines, they were fair game, to death. With their lightning fast advances, everything could be behind their lines.
  
Also to note- what the Germans did to partisans and Russians provoked the Russians I into giving payback. It was a horrible war for downward spirals of payback. </TEXT>

If you want to maximize dps you will have alchemy maxed out for the laboratory passive, increases potion length. If you do everything I listed and really get your rotation down you could push some serious dps. Also get sharpened VMA daggers. There are a few videos online by alcast to max alchemy fast and get your rotations down. YouTube him and check out his content </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few things I noticed: you can take off either SA or rapid strikes, pick one. If you're running solo content then drop the Rapids.  You can also drop camo hunter and flying blade, use weapon power/crit pots. They aren't as expensive now that you can get satchels with telvar and a lot of "free water" in the alliance bases in imp sewers.
  
Now with those 3 skills off your bars you can add rearming trap, blood craze(or other morph), and poison injection. The trap and poison are nonnegotiable. The blood craze can swap to steel nado.
  
I'd probably front bar Rend (DW ulti) and slot incap strike on back bar. Use incap when boss is close to 25% health.
  
This change should up your deeps significantly, and provide more survivability with HOTs like rend and blood craze.
  
Also look up a popular and up to date build and copy their CP. don't know mine offhand </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Originally AVA was designed to have many more hundreds of players participating. They've scaled it back due to performance issues, but didn't scale the map size back. I agree there isn't much incentive on the peripheral POIs, if there was more interest, maybe that would deal with Zerg balls. But as it is, people see 1 big battle and go to it, the other battles are a 30 min ride across the map (exaggeration but it's very far). If the map was smaller and denser, there would be more fights throughout, more entropy, and more places to go! I know it seems counter-intuitive, but I think it could work better, smaller. Then again it might just turn into 3 zerged at Alesia and nothing changes except riding times.  </TEXT>

I knew it'd be a long shot to find someone else between Xbox and PC but I thought I'd give the main ESO sub a try, to reach more people. The idea was to exchange the services for Xbox mats, gold, whatever, if they somehow had an Xbox acct too.

	<TEXT> Looking at picking up a PC copy of ESO. A few friends and I decided to give PC a whirl, as Xbox has let us down a few times now. Theres around 12 of us, all have completed vMOL and a few, not myself, are quite high up in PVP greatness (if thats a thing.) 
  
Anyway, I'm about to download it, was thinking Steam. Any issues there? 
  
Also, a few other random questions:
Any not-so-well-known add ons you like?
Can anyone craft me training gear at 10-15 level intervals?
What are some great PVP and PVE guilds? Who to connect with?

  
Anything else, just let me know!
  
Thanks all.

	<TEXT> vMOL is doable even with the disconnects. After the first boss it isn't as bad. You still will get the occasional DC on rak and the twins (which inevitably leads to a wipe). But my crew has made it thru twice now in the past week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You get scaled up to 160. Your gear level is the main factor in making sure you're effective.
  
Make sure you enchant all gear. If you're stam use hundings, magic use julianos. There are other options but that'll get you started on gear progression. 
  
Learn to block and self heal. Boost your dps, use max stat blue food.
  
Most mobs can be avoided by sneaking.
  
Or bring a lot of soul gems and deal with it. </TEXT>
