	<TEXT> I love this part:

  More likely to have provoked the president was Comeys recent congressional testimony, in which he said that it made him nauseous to think his actions affected the election results. This remark likely hit President Trumps most sensitive nerve. Anything that strikes at the legitimacy of his election is destabilizing to the president. He is insecure and seems to feel that his hold on his office is tenuous. Thats why reminders that he lost the popular vote make him apoplectic.  </TEXT>
