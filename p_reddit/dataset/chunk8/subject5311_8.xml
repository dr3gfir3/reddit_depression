	<TEXT> I'm also in northeast Oklahoma, and I just buy my PVA off Amazon. It's pretty cheap considering it goes a long way. 

If you need somewhere local, I've had good results with helmars acid free glue, found at hobby lobby. It's way more expensive than the stuff I get off Amazon though, so if you're going to be using a lot of it and want to save money, I'd suggest getting PVA from Amazon.
