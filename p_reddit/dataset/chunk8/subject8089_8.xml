	<TEXT> The *whole point* is that McDonald's was serving their coffee **far** hotter than industry standard, they *knew* it had the potential to cause severe injury, and consciously chose not to do so because their cost-benefit analysis suggested that it was less expensive to settle lawsuits than to reduce the temperature to within industry standards.

No reasonable person would have any reason to expect that coffee would be as hot as they cup they served her.  But for the wholly ridiculous temperature of the coffee served to her, she would not have suffered the way she did.  McDonald's owes her a debt they can *never* repay, because the horrors she suffered were caused by *nothing* other than their own greed. </TEXT>

Ummm...it's too clich, but I can't help it...are you me?  I am also a redheaded reader girl who lives in Appalachia.  Before I even noticed that, though, what I was going to say was:

You are absolutely correct.  In addition, IME, a majority of those people who have been displaced from the coal industry and who, as you mention, don't have the necessary education or training to do the jobs in other fields are **bitterly** opposed to the notion of retraining/additional training.  They almost universally insist that the coal jobs should just be magically brought back and there is a palpable petulance toward any suggestion that they might have to entertain another solution. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a huge nerd about mythology in general.  By far, my favorite class in college was an English elective called "Mythology, Legend, and Folklore."

I'm partial to the Greek myths in general.  As a kid, I spent *hours* in my room poring over [D'Aulaires Book of Greek Myths](http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSyTznJwjsrGtsQMMp9IhIFrXy1I_vvMnafSwB9_obSnqaL-6v0).  It's always been hard for me to choose a favorite, but I'm very partial to the story of Demeter, Persephone, and Hades.  I've also always been fascinated by Hestia -- she's included as an Olympian in most versions of the stories, but there's some evidence that her existence as a goddess of home and hearth predates the body of them.

This answer makes me feel like a traitor to all of the other stories that I love....Artemis and Orion, Echo and Narcissus, the birth of Athena....

This is hard. </TEXT>

*My* spidey-sense is telling me that they are trying to play CYA with regard to a potential wrongful termination suit because *they* know the reason they're prematurely terminating OP's contract is because of the FMLA use.  That's illegal (but employers do it all the time) and what they're worried about is that sooner or later, OP's going to put 2 and 2 together.  So to protect themselves from him making a complaint later, they're attempting to have OP create a paper trail that belies that argument.

	<TEXT> He didn't force any student to do that, and he *did* encourage original thinking.  The way the assignment was presented and graded meant that if a student approached it from an earnest perspective (took a crack at it) and supported a particular argument for a plan of action/solution, he was graded on the cogency of his argument and supports used. It's not like he failed (or graded poorly) students who didn't catch on to the trick.  It's just that he was also rewarding students who were able to synthesize the lessons we had learned over the course of the semester that point strongly to the idea that this nut is particularly hard to crack. </TEXT>

It may not be *technically* unsolvable, in the sense that sooner or later, something's got to give.

When I took "Foreign Policy of the United States" in my poli-sci program, the term paper was about our North Korea policy.  It was supposed to be roughly split in thirds:  trace and discuss the modern history of U.S. policy / analyze and evaluate said policies / recommend solutions and future courses of action.

The last third was a trick question.  The professor actually expected us to be able to explain in the last third of the paper why there wasn't any known realistic solution to this conundrum, not solve it...because we had spent the entire semester learning all of the reasons why it is unsolvable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/MaskedDropBear has given some excellent advice here, *especially* about knife skills and mise-en-place.

I only have a couple of things to add:

Get yourself a copy of the *Joy of Cooking*.  It's old-school in the best possible way...an encyclopedia of the most important information you need to know about ingredients and cooking techniques as well as classic and innovative recipes.

There's a reason that book has been the kitchen bible of generations of home cooks.

As far as recipes, it's kind of hard to narrow down suggestions without knowing your taste or where you are in terms of skill.  What is your favorite meat/vegetable/grain/fruit?  What kinds of ethnic food do you like? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK...since you and /u/Devagamster both asked so nicely, I'll try to recap briefly for you.

After I mentioned that my son had figure skated in elementary school, dudebro says, "I am so, so sorry."  To which I replied, "That's cool, but I'm not..."

He then told me to let him know how that was working out for me when my son started to identify as an Apache attack helicopter.  My reply to that begins with, "Oooh, I love it!"

Then he pretended to be confused and asked why I thought he was talking about the figure skating (as opposed to...?) and said he was just sorry that I have a kid.  Sorry for my son and sorry for me, he said.

I stopped replying at that point, but then some other people called him out and his answer was that I was a bad parent and a boring person, and I knew it.

I hope that's not too convoluted to follow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While jurisdiction should always be the first question you ask, in this case, it pretty much doesn't matter what state he's in, and here's why:

Since "Motor Voter" legislation was enacted federally in the '80s, virtually all of the state boards of elections began using not *just* voter registration data, but *also* DMV records, to compile their jury duty rosters.

What this means is that in almost every state (I can guess at 1 or 2 exceptions, but I won't, because I'm not sure), if you have a driver's license or state-issued ID card **it doesn't matter at all what party you are registered with, or if you are even registered to vote, period**...you will still end up on the jury duty roster.

*Some* of the rules make sense, of course...at least they still do compulsories...kind of.  Most people don't even know though (because it's a boring-ass event no one watches) that the "figure" in figure skating comes from the fact that the first skaters were judged primarily by how accurately they could trace prescribed shapes, such as figure 8's, into the ice.  So, in that sense I'm glad they have maintained what may seem, from the outside, like arcane rules.  Because a skater's ability to meticulously draw shapes into the ice actually does speak to how technically proficient she is.

But the bulk of figure skating's rules are prissy, elitist bullshit that are about as clear as mud and as consistent as a crackhead's work attendance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That doesn't really hold water when figure skaters, especially male figure skaters, have been performing this (and other far more dangerous) moves in expositions and other non-competitive performances since the '70s.  The backflip has been Scott Hamilton's signature move for *decades* (Ice Capades, anyone?), and it's certainly not inherently more dangerous for a woman to attempt it than for a man.

Like most figure skating rules, it has little to nothing to do with athletes' safety, but public image and the sport's own self-concept as an activity of the "well-bred."  No, seriously.

1)  "It just doesn't look nice."

2)  "We've always done it this way."

IIRC, backflips were originally frowned upon because they were seen as visually unladylike and unattractive...and also because figure skating is eternal frenemies with gymnastics and often explicitly prohibits moves it deems as being "too gymnastic." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The correct response is "Thank YOU!"

As someone who has worked in one customer service capacity or another for more than 2 decades, I understand where you are coming from with this, in that the business owes thanks to the customer, not the other way around.

But it's important to remember that "you're welcome" is considered the polite response to "thank you" in virtually every other social context, and that its use is so ingrained in people that saying it is often more reflexive than intentional.  It's also important to remember that the cashier using the "incorrect" response probably makes minimum wage but can be fired for her till being off by a few cents -- and that, unless she works at Chik-Fil-A -- there's an excellent chance that no one has *ever* told her how or why a customer could take offense to this.

If you actually **hate** the people around you who do this, it says way more about you than it does about them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not OP, but morels are very special, even as wild mushrooms go.  They are *highly* prized among mushroom hunters for their intense, savory flavor and meaty, chewy texture.

They are flavorful and hearty tasting enough to substitute beautifully for chicken or even beef in most dishes, so they are also extremely popular in vegetarian and vegan versions of classic recipes. </TEXT>

I probably wear mine every day, even if it's just for a few minutes around the house.  I usually have to remind myself to take it off on laundry day, because 9 times out of 10, I'm wearing it while doing the laundry.  When I think "comfy," I think of **my** hoodie. </TEXT>

IME, it *is* often military spouses (of both genders), though, as well as keyboard warriors and a certain subset of people who have had relatives in the armed forces, but who, for whatever reason, haven't enlisted themselves or who have tried to, but were rejected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know a *lot* of people who fish who do it for the meditative aspect more than for the food or sport...but most of them discovered that by accident on their own; it's not why or how they started fishing, typically.

One of the reasons, I think, that it's so hard to explain this "other purpose" of fishing to the uninitiated is that in popular culture, it's really not been marketed or perceived that way.  For one thing, it's called "fishing" not "chillaxing on a boat gazing into the water," which understandably leads people to the conclusion that it must be all about the fish.  For another, "fish stories" are a well-known trope, but their retelling tends to be competitive and boisterous. 

So what people who've never fished think they know about the activity gives them no frame of reference for how passive/receptive of a process it is by its nature, and no concept of how much time is necessarily spent just 'being' there on the water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it's true that a state university is far less likely (or able, in some cases) to be moved by this appeal than a private university with an endowment of its own would be, I can't think of a single disadvantage to sending it. It can only help your daughter -- as you are aware, the worst they can say is "no," in which case, you've already outlined her other options.

FWIW, I think the way you framed the issue is excellent and the letter is very well written overall.  If any parent's request is likely to garner attention, it would be one such as this.

Bottom line:  If you *don't* ask, the answer is *always* "no." </TEXT>
