 How do plastics create enough flame heat to melt connection points because the section dropped pretty clean in one complete section. Unless there were existing defects or the expansion joints gave out yes it is a little suspicious.

I guess if they admit it was a terrorist attack it would validate their technique. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's sort of puzzling is how it fell in one piece which ment the connection points would've probably had to have been exposed to direct heat and flame. 4 corners got the precise amount of heat to cause a clean collapse? Even if one or two connection points failed wouldn't the collapse have been irregular instead of a clean break?  Keep in mind many roads, bridges, overpasses have expansion joints for changes in temperature but still. </TEXT>

 Trump likes to delegate and will delegate to people he trusts first and foremost regardless of resume(one of the reasons all posts aren't filled yet). That means someone like Ivanka who has his ear could be "an" influence on just about any issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assad was still in power in a vicious civil war. I doubt he would risk foreign intervention for 'a' chemical attack. Wether a civilian population suffers death and injury from standard or chemical weapons the results are still the same. Yes there is certain fear with chemical weapons but those who have suffered otherwise might beg to differ  

After a fact finding trip to Syria Gabbard herself said it would be tough to get both sides into negotiations. And there are no moderate rebels. Many think the rebels are aligned with Al Qaeda.

Again why would Assad risk foreign intervention.

She is right. The proof needs to shown to congress and the American people then world. </TEXT>

Also remember Bill Clinton appointed his wife to push Hillary Health-she just didn't get a job she got an assignment which would have directly affected everyone-Hillary Health would've been harsher than Obama Care.

Trump is a big time delegator. There are two primary factors when delegating. Trust and competency. Trump prioritizes loyalty above all   else then looks for competency or go-to people. Trump was able to build and manage a lot of his business with family. Now he can't do that. Competent people and a good resume is always out there. It's  the over emphasis on loyalty that is dragging on Trump. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The telecoms/baby bells and American Cable Association pushed and praised this.

 These utilities are making their money off public property ie poles, holes and airwaves. Not only should the public benefit but should have a say how that business is conducted or exactly how much they can do.

 Part of the reason Ma Bell was broken up was to stop them from selling service and equipment. Shouldn't content be regarded as equipment. They literally should be a pipeline, not the water in it. 

Then they cry about the likes of Google. If any browser goes into the communication and/or data transport business they should be regulated like a utility, not the other way around-unregulating the existing utilities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen these gas taxes proposed/enacted all over the country. One thing they always seem to miss or under play is the wear and tear heavier vehicles put on the road compared to most cars. It's weight that stresses the roads as much as volume. 

People think if they take a bus or get home deliveries they're avoiding the stress of driving a SUV or minivan on the road but it's those buses and trucks that put a lot of the wear on roads. These vehicles and/or services need to be taxed more, not the driver of most cars. They should pay something yes because they use the roads but do not wear them down the most. 

SUVs, Pick up Trucks and larger need to be taxed more, not a lot but more. And most delivery services using anything bigger than a car should have a small surcharge put on each delivery to account for that heavier vehicle wear and tear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Several things going on here which everyone seems to be lumping into one big bowl of wax. First Russian "hacking", 'interference' and routine intelligence activities are all different things. Same for these "ties". Perfunctory, incidental, routine or social contact all different things. 

Manafort and Flynn were problems and let go. Flynn was apparently deceitful if not negligent on disclosure. Manafort was done before the election. Both because their activities were pretty clear. if not illegal  These two might be nothing more than businessmen with dealings all over the map. Ironic that some aggressive private deal making businessmen are the ones that could bring down Trump.

Also be aware that just because a talking head or politician has an opinion, repeat opinion but not evidence does not make it true. The narrative becomes what certain people say and/or their stated opinion, NOT the evidence they cite. Things literally get lost in the translation if they get translated at all.

That being said these hearings need to start going public with results and public testimony. They could be working on something really big or it could be like that 13 page intelligence report  with one page of known code, groups that might or most likely have done something.

That being said Maddow had to hype the heck out of it so if the numbers could be a reflection of the Maddow fans only. I wouldn't worry as a conservative. If her numbers are new viewers that could be an issue and another reflection of the political sediment in the country.

	<TEXT> Open primaries perpetuate the two party system because it gives little or no incentive to create a third party or run as an independent. That means no matter what the candidate and/or politician will be playing politics with the public AND their party/one of the two establishment parties.

 Sanders stood a better chance going third party but his candidacy got buried in the internal politics of one of the two establishment parties. Open primaries help legitimize the status quo by minimizing third party or independent candidates-The Dems and Reps love this stuff because perpetuates the myth that one of those two is the only way to vote-don't go third party participate in ours. It keeps the competition/alternatives at arms length.

If a state or party wants to allow outsiders to participate that's their decision. 

People still get to vote in the general election. It's not like people don't have 'a' choice. Time might be better spent making it easier to run/get on the ballot as a third party or independent. </TEXT>
