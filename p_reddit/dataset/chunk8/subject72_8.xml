	<TEXT> Tunnel vision Mercy and kill her ASAP. Running into a duo like that a lone, would probably result in your death anyways. So trying to kill a pocketed 76 is not a bright idea. Because even if you actually kill him, the Mercy might rez, or even worse escape to her teammates and keeps them healed up. So this is how I think: Kill Mercy and die, and deny her from helping her team out. </TEXT>
