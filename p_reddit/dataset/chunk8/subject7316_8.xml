	<TEXT> My name is Niels Birbaumer, I am a Professor for Behavioral Neuroscience at the Univ.Tuebingen, Germany and the Wyss Center of Bio and Neuroengeneering in Genva, Switzerland. I am joined by Ujwal Chaudhary, a postdoctoral researcher (group leader) at the Univ. Tuebingen, Germany. We work on brain-computer interfaces to help people in paralysis communicate.


We recently published an [article](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0315) in PLOS Biology demonstrating direct brain communication of completely paralyzed, locked-in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehring's disease. In our study, four completely paralyzed patients (including eye paralysis) were able to answer many questions with a "yes" or "no" over extended time periods just by thinking yes or no. The thoughts were detected with a functional near infrared spectroscopy-based (fNIRS) auditory brain-computer interface at the bedside of these patients.


These results may be the first step towards abolition of completely locked-in states, at least for patients with ALS.


Well be answering your questions at 1pm EST  Ask Us Anything! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi this is Seth:  I have always been interested in the face and human variation in general (my background is in anthropology).  Most interesting to me is the connection to facial birth defects and syndromes, which is my other area of study.  It is interesting that many of the regions contained genes implicated in these conditions.  Maybe a mutation in these genes results in a syndrome, but common variation in these same genes can influence typical-range traits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi this is Seth: I am fascinated by this stuff, especially from the historical perspective.  The practice you are talking about is called physiognomy and stretches back as far as aristotle.  what is really interesting is that there is all kinds of evidence that face and brain development are intimately linked.  There are facial differences in individuals with schizophrenia...and brain differences in individuals with cleft lip and palate (i did my post-doc on this).  Some recent studies have tried to connect facial morphology to aggression, which may make sense if both are influenced by hormones.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> John R. Shaffer:  Interesting idea. I suppose that, in theory, we could determine all combinations of genetic variants related to facial morphology, assuming that we had cataloged them all (we havent yet).  It would take a lot of work to really understand how they all act together!  And dont forget, genetics is only part of the story.  Environmental and behavioral factors play a role, too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> John R. Shaffer:  Good question.  In genetics we study both families and unrelated individuals, and some scientific questions can be better addressed in one study design or the other.  In our study, unrelated individuals were used to help us understand population facial norms, and because it was helpful for the statistical analysis to have independent observations.  You are right that family studies can be very helpful to investigate genetics of all kinds of traits, including facial variation.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Katya: Some facial differences, including asymmetry, can signal an increased risk for genetic conditions. Most people have a few features, facial or otherwise, that are outside the "norm." For example, some people have hypertelorism (far apart spacing of the eyes), or a wide nasal bridge. But certain combinations of otherwise benign features can signal an increased risk for genetic conditions. One of the most common ones that comes to mind is 22q microdeletion, which presents with a wide nasal bridge, a longer face, and a smaller lower jaw (micrognathia), among others. Other examples include Waardenburg syndrome and Stickler syndrome. </TEXT>

good questions--that for the most part we don't have answers to !
(1)  there is a relatively new area of genetics studying imprinting which are situations in which some of one parent's genes are preferentially expressed in the offspring.  There are now many examples of these in animal models, and a couple examples in humans.  We don't yet know of any studies that have studied these mechanisms in human faces.
(2)  there are a variety of mechanisms that influence the expression of gene variants---one of those mechanisms is dominance of certain variants.
(3) there are some nutritional factors that can influence facial features but these are usually quite severe cases of nutritional imbalances. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi this is seth: Such an interesting question.  I would like to suggest that genes play a role, but a study like this has simply not been done yet.  I found a website once where people could find their dopplegangers.  My first thought was i would love to find these folks and enroll them in a study.  We may be able to do this in reverse though, by looking at people with the closest DNA match in our sample and seeing how similar/different their faces are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi this is seth: There are some studies using x-ray images - mostly out of Japan.  They are generally small samples.  The big problem with this approach to imaging the face is the radiation exposure.  We used 3d photography which is totally non-invasive.  The downside, however, is that we cannot look directly at skeletal morphology.  Both types of tissues are influenced by environmental factors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi this is Seth: Yes there are a few companies working on things like this based on facial recognition methods developed in the computer science field.  This kind of work is still in its early stages.  As a side note: we work with some folks in the CANDELA consortium on a collaboration so stay tuned for that.  Here's how I see the main applications of our work: studies like this can help us gain a better understanding of how particular genes/pathways influence facial development (more of a basic science application), improve our knowledge of how genetic variation relates to the types of features we see with certain birth defects and syndromes (like why are some individuals more or less severely affected), and possibly (in the future) make predictive models about how the face grows. </TEXT>

Thanks for the question.  in the time since your son was born our research group and other groups around the world have been engaged in many genetics studies of cleft lip and palate.  To date about 20 genetic regions and some specific genes have been identified as associated with cleft lip and palate but it is important to note that these results so far are at a population level, that is we do not yet know how to apply these results to individual families.  So in summary, we are much closer to understanding the causes, developmental processes, and genes that contribute to cleft lip and palate but still have work to do. </TEXT>

Your last point about mosaicism is fascinating---for our study we took our genetic samples (DNA) from white blood cells, we did not take samples directly from the face.  Mosaicism could potentially influence the develop of body parts including the face, but to our knowledge no study has investigaged mosaicism in tissues from the face.

We excluded subjects if they had a personal history of facial trauma, a personal history of facial reconstructive or plastic surgery, a personal history of orthognathic/jaw surgery or jaw advancement, a personal history of any facial prosthetics or implants, a personal history of any palsy, stroke or neurologic condition affecting the face, a personal or family history of any facial anomaly or birth defect, and/or a personal or family history of any syndrome or congenital condition known to affect the head or face. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi this is Seth: There are a number of groups trying go from DNA to face, with a great interest from agencies like the FBI and police.  A critical thing to keep in mind is that this work is still in its infancy.  Researchers looking at the genetic basis of human facial shape have collectively identified a very small faction of the variants that influence these complex traits - thus, we can only explain a small amount of facial variation at this point.  Critically, though, even if ALL the genetic variants were known, we would still only have part of the story, because there are numerous non-genetic factors (diet, prenatal nutrition, mechanical forces) that influence the size and shape of our faces. So we are still a long way off in our view.  This however has not stopped companies from making claims that they can identify faces from DNA.  Right now, be suspicious of these claims. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi Reddit, this is Seth Weinberg. I am here with my colleagues today to discuss our paper in PLOS Genetics concerning the identification of genetic variants that influence human facial features. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Seth Weinberg.  I am an Associate Professor in the [Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics](http://www.dental.pitt.edu/center-craniofacial-and-dental-genetics) at the University of Pittsburgh.  I am a biological anthropologist by training and my research focuses on uncovering the factors that influence the development of normal and abnormal craniofacial variation.

The paper we will be discussing today is [Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Multiple Loci Influencing Normal Human Facial Morphology]( http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006149 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0308) . For background, in a genome-wide association study or GWAS, millions of genetic variants spread across all the chromosomes are tested for a statistical relationship with one or more traits.  A GWAS can help researchers hone in on chromosomal regions (loci) that may harbor genes or other genetic elements of interest.  We measured over 3000 faces with 3D photogrammetry for this project, and then used these measurements as traits in our GWAS.  Although it may seem obvious that facial features have a genetic basis (e.g., familial resemblance), very little is known about how variation in specific regions of the genome relates to the kinds of distinguishing facial characteristics that give rise to our unique identities.  In this paper, we discovered a number of loci influencing different aspects of facial shape (e.g. spacing between the eyes or width of the nose).  Interestingly, many of these associated loci contained genes known to play a role in the development of the face.

I work with an interdisciplinary team comprised of human geneticists and biostatisticians.  I am here today with several of my colleagues including: John Shaffer (Assistant Professor of Human Genetics), Eleanor Feingold (Professor of Human Genetics), Mary Marazita (Professor of Oral Biology and Human Genetics), Katya Orlova (PhD student in Human Genetics), and Myoung Keun Lee (Biostatistician).

This is the first time our group is participating in a redditscience AMA, and we are excited to be here.

Well be answering questions at 1pm ET -- Ask Us Anything! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Privacy: There cold be issues if you determine you are at risk for a disease and you provider discriminates against you, which should not be possible for an existing condition. I would argue it is better to get these measurements and manage your health better, than stay private, but that is a personal decision. I wold also argue health care providers should be paying you (or offering you a discount) because I think you will manage you health better if you are collecting this information.

I think the devices and algorithms need reasonable testing and establishment of validity and this will require some regulatory oversight.  For detecting common is should be similar to that of an oral thermometer. For something more serious this will likely require more regulatory oversight by the FDA.

	<TEXT> Tx for your enthusiasm. Lots of question here. For the genoe interpretation you really need to talk to an expert who can 
a) evaluate your risk for highly penetrant diseases (e.g. BRCA1, 2, SHBD, etc), 
b) drug response/sensitivity
c) Complex disease risk. This is more controversial, but it did work for me.

For wearables, we like heart rate skin temp, galvanic stress response (i.e. conductance across your skin), sleep and activity. The device we used for the study was Basis Peak because it measured all of these.  This device is no longer available.we are exploring apple watch (we did not exist when we started our study) and fitibit, among others, but presently they do non measure skin temperature and galvanic stress response which we think are important. So I guss you can say we are still looking around

For SpO2, we like the Masimo oximeter because it gives continuous SpO2 measurements. For the future I want ECG, blood pressure and continuous SpO2!

	<TEXT> For most of the devices that we have used, some measurements are quite accurate, for example heart rate and SpO2, and even steps and activity are pretty good.  Even for devices that are less accurate you can still detect difference from baseline, and that is the key pointearly detection of differences relative to your healthy baseline. 

I suspect that the measurements made from these devices are more accurate than the measurements obtained during a brief visit in the doctors office. From wearable data, you can easily extract baseline (resting) heart rates, skin temp and other measurements by looking at a person dashboard for any length of time you wantdays, weeks months, etc We think this will be very powerful.

For device validation many companies do very extensive validation before they hit the market, usually with physician input. We perform our own internal valdiation of each device that we used just to be sure and impartial--it help us select the devices that we used.

If a device is generally flawed, I am not sure what the course of action is beyond blog posts and perhaps publishing the results. For an individual device one can reach out to the manufacturer and get a replacement--we have had not problem with that.

You might not want someone running to the docotr everytime they get teh earliest sign of a mild illness, but you might want them to stay home so they do not infecct lots of other folks.  Of course for serious illness, like Lyme disease they need to see a doctor.  That signature is unmistakable--it was extremely strong, at least for my case. </TEXT>
