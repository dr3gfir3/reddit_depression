	<TEXT> Thanks for answering. I know it officially runs at 1280x1024 but I'm wondering whether it'll still work properly when a higher 1440x1152 is forced onto it. Some monitors just say input signal out of range while others handle it just fine.  </TEXT>

Will it accept this input? I have a similar Lenovo monitor which works fine with that resolution even though it's only 1280x1024 native.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know this is strange, but I'm really trying very hard to find a good condition Lenovo L171p Monitor (5:4) for my PC setup. It's quite hard to find any online; those that I found were Grade C refurbished while Amazon lists another for US$100+. That's my last resort but I'll appreciate it if any of you know where to get one of this. I think this model was quite popular with businesses and corporations.

As to the why, I currently run a 27" 1440p monitor with an existing L171p (in portrait @ 1152x1440) on the right. I want another L171p on the left at the same resolution for some of my simulation games (so that total resolution is 4864x1440). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My parents both moved from HK to Singapore to become citizens in the late '80s. I think it's easier to live a more comfortable live here because of the lower population density and housing prices. Even driving here is better because there's no 2-hour traffic jams. 


For me personally, I'll never move to HK because of the unstable political environment (it's China after all) and high prices of housing there. Their flats are ridiculously small (~200-300sqft are common) and everywhere you look there's people. It's way too overcrowded there but if you studied in Singapore and can speak Cantonese, there are plenty of good paying jobs waiting since our English 'proficiency' is much better than theirs.  </TEXT>

It's more discouraging to know that the more money you make, the more goes away to helping others buy their BMW/Merc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't misunderstand you. I'm saying to introduce reassessment after the buyer has purchased the HDB. 

Okay, the HDB owner is the legal owner, but I'm not saying asking them to leave without compensation, like a repossession. I'm saying get them to pay back the subsidised amount or find a new private home to move to. 

As a taxpayer, I don't want my money to go to people who are perhaps even richer than me, just because they live in a different type of housing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point of the COE system was to make cars prohibitively expensive to reduce their numbers on the road. So if HDB dwellers choose to use their subsidies to pay the extra taxes on cars, it's quite counterintuitive. 


Maybe it seems unfair to force someone to leave, but perhaps pay back the subsidies granted since they can afford it now? It's unfair to other taxpayers who continually have to fork out to subsidise those who don't need it. An example I can think of is the GST vouchers and the utilities rebate. I live in a condo, but there are many who live in HDBs with higher incomes. They get the vouchers and rebates, I don't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I think it's fair. You've made it now, so you should stop consuming HDB services/lodging that's subsidised for those less well-to-do. By continuing to stay in the HDB flat, other taxpayers have to continue paying for your consumption of things like subsidised town council fees.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because it's difficult to draw the line doesn't mean that it's not the right thing to do. Cars are already a luxury, let alone luxury cars. 

Also, if you can afford to take multiple expensive holidays in a year, perhaps it's time to give up your HDB to people who need it more. It's like being on financial support and buying a new iPhone every year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to be downvoted to hell but I think HDB dwellers who can afford luxury cars (I've seen Porsches even) should be forced to sell their HDB for a private home or pay back the entire amount subsidised on their flats. 


I don't think it's right to live in subsidised housing funded by taxpayers and use the money saved to wantonly spend on a luxury item.  </TEXT>
