	<TEXT> 2002 325cic here, I live in Watertown and I moved here from DC area. The big (unforeseen) mistake I made is installing bilstein pss kit which lowers the car dramatically, even on the highest setting. Was awesome on DC streets but is beyond painful on Boston streets (The road quality here is terrible!!). Also want to pass on feedback on a fantastic mechanic in Belmont area - Boston Motor Werks - he is resonable and goes well beyond the extra mile. My first visit to him he gave me a full report of my car (carfax, recall history, all engine readouts and a future log of routine maintenance which he confirmed was performed or not by a thorough inspection) all included with fixing the issue i brought it in, in the first place. Good Luck and enjoy!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a good write up on the oil separator: Product Details

The experts at ECS Tuning have assembled a kit to include everything that you need to get your oil separator system back into order.
BMW has an ongoing issue with oil separators freezing in cold weather if driving is done before the vehicle is fully warmed up. There is often a howling noise followed by numerous oil leaks. The crankcase breather valve is used to purge the oil vapor from the engine block into the valve cover. However, sometimes condensation can cause it to freeze, causing the entire oil separator system to fail, crack, and disintegrate.
Replace all the components of the oil separator system together to prevent damage to all the aspects of your engine. As long as you have everything off, you can rest assured that new parts will last and be reliable.
Our Level 1 kit includes the following;
Oil separator
Hose from oil separator to dipstick tube
Hose from oil separator to valve cover
Hose from intake manifold back to the connector hose
Hose from oil separator up to the intake manifold
It is highly recommended to replace the oil dipstick tube with the updated design by BMW as this also a common place for sludge to build up. </TEXT>
