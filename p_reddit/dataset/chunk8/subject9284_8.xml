Here's a quote from then Governor Reagan

[D]o we no longer think it necessary to teach self-respect, self-discipline, and respect for law and order? Will we allow a great university to be brought to its knees by a noisy dissident minority? Will we meet their neurotic vulgarities with vacillation and weakness? Or will we tell those entrusted with administering the university we expect them to enforce a code based on decency, common sense, and dedication to the high and noble purpose of that university?" </TEXT>

And yes, we do limit P9 to one.  

HOWEVER, it'd be fun to see this deck IRL and if you worked your ass off, collected enough money to buy them and play the deck, have at it!  A couple games of guaranteed losses would be fun to see this.

In theory, if Repubs control all three (H, S, WH) then the need to agree to 'pork for votes' is greatly diminished 

Therefore Repubs should only do what's actually required to pass bills, since they should be on similar grounds.

	<TEXT> Networking is extremely complicated. 

Say for example you and some buddies (guys and girls!) are playing CoD, LoL, or WoW.  

You all have amazing ping and YUGE network connectivity.  See, companies like Riot Games or Sony or Blizzard Entertainment can PAY to make sure you have the fastest access possible, because it's important to them, no, it's VITAL to the success of their gaming to keep you connected.  They have a right to offer money to make it so.

Now take the Cuckington Post.  Blazing fast connections to their servers aren't really that important.  Loading that propaganda bullshit 1.3 seconds faster isn't going to really make anyone rage-quit their shitty biased website.  So they aren't likely to want to offer money for more bandwidth and direct access.

Where Net Neutrality comes in to play, is to say that NO ONE can pay for better access to data flow.  Regardless of how critical it is to their success.

This is why Net Neutrality needs to die.

People who own products and services need to be able to sell them openly in whatever fashion they want.  If you don't want the products, don't buy em.  If you want em, but don't want theirs, go buy em from someone else.

But no human being has a RIGHT to take property (or information) from someone else, just because 'they want it, like really bad'.

Regardless of how you feel about alcohol, sugar, cigarette, marijuana and big pharma - they each add billions to the national economy and provide people a life choice to have vices.  MaryJ is the only one that makes drug cartels billionaires and Americans poorer.

Bill should be tried for rape.

JP should be tried for child endangerment (among other things).

Rice, Abedin, and half her staff were complicit and should also be in jail

Seth Rich should be alive

Countless others should be alive

Benghazi should never have happened

Obama wasn't even an American-born citizen

Too many weightlifting accidents

Transferring 250,000,000,000 to Pakistan and other alt-left questionable slush funds isn't enough?

96% are firmer now than we ever were.  4% is either a margin of error or that maybe when 100% of lying #FakeNews narrative actually brainwashed the weaker minds.  Either way, fuck em.

	<TEXT> After all deductions, for a renter who is head of houshold, you can deduct around $10,200.  The theory is this is the cost to live.  

Tell me in what planet can a person live for $10,200?

This number should be tripled.

Also: rent!!!  Just because you rent vs own, an individual cannot deduct rent at any level, but a business can.  

People who rent, like people who have mortgage interest, should get to deduct that cost up to a certain amount.  $1k a month?  $2k a month?  Something that makes sense for people.  This would also help parents with kids in college! </TEXT>
