	<TEXT> I agree with some of that(frat boy thing). Our rogue police is out of control. They are corrupt, power hungry and violent. That being said more white people have been killed by cops than black people. The media doesn't talk about or show it because they want to keep us divided. There are a lot black people who have been killed by cops because the color of their skin but that's not all who are being killed. It's just the only thing being shown because its something else to make people pick sides and be divided. Either you're on the side of the cops or you are aren't. It's,all utter bullshit. We are all in danger of police brutality no matter the skin color.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's only coded language because you're making it that way. I understand  that some people do use the word thug as a way to be racist in more of "socially accepted" manner but to assume every white person does is what pisses people off thus widening the divide. Words only have the power that you give it.
You said people called them criminals. Nobody said they were "criminals". They said they were thugs because they were acting thuggish. If they were white I'd say they were thugs. I damn well wouldn't put it off as "just some dumbasses". I would call them thugs. Same with a Mexican soccer team if that happened, or an Indian cricket match, or a Norwegian whatever the fuck they do. You get my point. I know it's tough to let your guard down but not every white person is a racist who uses the word thug when referring to a black person. And you assuming that is what continues this bullshit mobius strip we're in as a society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do come from a family of racists. My mom's side against blacks and my dad's side against whites. So I guess you're right. The thing is that as long as there are different races there's going to be racism. It's not going away no matter how many social justice warriors there are. The key is to understand that we don't have to accept people, just respect them as a fellow human. Then we can get along. Instead we just spin our wheels wasting time fighting the wrong enemy. My point is that this divisive shit has to stop. When we are divided we are easier to conquer and you are just widening the divide.  </TEXT>

p.s. I know this might come as a shock to you but you're the reason Trump is in office. You're "everything is racist", safe space, divisive bullshit rhetoric is what put him there. You can blame "white people" or the "spooky" Russians all you want but that isn't the reason why. You. You are the reason why. I know you won't understand why what I'm saying is true but that's just because you're a racist ;) Happy Inauguration Day  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't agree its gossip but, I mean, they're kinda right. It just feels like we are spinning our wheels. Of course the gov't is saturated with corruption and fucked up shit.  We know that. They need to be hanged from the gallows. We know that. It just gets very frustrating because it seems like the same shit we know keeps getting circulated and it lulls us to sleep. When are we going to get to the point where we start doing shit about it or at least really start talking about action? I know the roadblocks that are in the way...Gestapo police force, apathy, social media making people lazy, gadgets making us too comfortable, no individual power, hard to mobilize and plan without being spied on, etc.
But there has to be a way. Corruption, murder, money laundering, and pedophilia are happening at the highest levels and it seems like all we do is talk about it, flip the page to read about the next thing, get angry about how fucked up it is, and then roll our eyes and go on to the next fucked up thing to be angry about(rightfully so). 
I don't know the answers to what we can do (trying to open people's eyes is valiant but just doesn't produce the results we need) I'm just overly frustrated. It seems like we just constantly spin our wheels and wait for shit to come out so we can "see, I told you so" then rinse, wash and repeat. I am guilty of this as well. Maybe it's just time to stay in my bubble I created and shut out everything and everyone not in it. I know that's counterproductive and it makes me feel like I've given up but maybe I'll be happier. Anyways, sorry for frustrated rant. Carry on.

	<TEXT> Hahaha. Clinton? Really? I hope that cunt dies in public. Greenwald might speak the occasional truth but he is a useful idiot. It's easy to look up the information. You probably aren't used to doing that though before you just spout off asinine shit. Sigh, you're just another dullard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might as well gut it. It's not like it's stopping anybody (on both sides of the isle) from being unethical and it's just wasting money. The U.S. government is saturated with corruption. This is not a partisan issue. We have to stop this divisive bullshit and stop looking to these crooks like they have the answers and our best interest in mind. We have to get back to knowing our neighbors, properly utilizing our land and focusing on who we put in local office. The soap opera, tv politicians have nothing for us. We must take responsibility and stop playing into a broken system set to divide and conquer us.  </TEXT>
