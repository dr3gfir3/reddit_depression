	<TEXT> Instead of going with Yext, etc. which seems ridiculously expensive, we thought we could hire a junior level person to manually update everything on the main networks.  Is that completely stupid or do people do that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Most people who opt for a crossover SUV like the Honda CR-V will do so for either its all-wheel drive or spacious design; this model will make you happy either way. The rear seats split 60/40 and fold down so you can switch from maximizing cargo room to passenger seating in seconds. 

Who doesn't love cargo space! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She's always been a bit of a side character, like Rosita. 

I don't think we need fan favorites to sustain the show.  They can make new fan favorites, and there are plenty of them already.  They need more Glenn moments, multiple per season.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah.  At least Kingdom had armor and the McPoyles look like garbage dwellers.  The Saviors and Alexandria and Hilltop people are all indistinguishable, though.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was really pumped to see him explode.  I love his character, but I really needed him to die in this episode.  He made that comment to Sasha, something like, "If they get themselves killed, that's on them.  It's the result of their actions."  And so I loved the idea that he would die simply because he picked the wrong side.

So I was disappointed the explosives didn't go off.  Honestly, they could have done without the McPoyles and started their attack on Negan by exploding Eugene and taking out a few saviors before Negan calls for a ceasefire and reveals Sasha's coffin.  Then the same dramatic shit plays out, the Saviors make some gains but Maggie and the Kingdom arrive.

	<TEXT> It felt too much, though.  I already found Negan too unbelievable.  This guy would no way last in the real world.  He takes too many chances.  Then, in the middle of an all out firefight between three or four sizable groups, he's crackin' jokes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is stupid.  It really felt like a cheap plot twist because there was no motivation for them to side with Negan.  Also, after seeing Negan in action and hearing him, they should have realized this was not the partner they wanted.  

It was just dumb all around.  But maybe these trash people are idiots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is was a really good episode.  It shouldn't have been, but it was.  There was plenty to be upset about, but somehow it didn't matter.  I think it's because of the slow burn of this season.  I was desperate for something, anything, and this latest episode sort of gave us something, I think.

The big problems:  

* Nobody died, other than Sasha.  With all the shooting going on and utter mayhem, no one significant got killed.  Major plot armor.
* Nobody shot the tall garbage pail kid.  She was on a watch tower in the middle of all the action and the leader of the gang.  An easy and obvious target.
* Nobody notices a huge fuckin' tiger sneaking up on you?
* How did Negan manage to hold court in the middle of a shootout?  Weird.

And yeah, basically everything relates to that shootout.  How did anyone tell people apart?  Why did Maggie and the tiger arrive at such a convenient time?  Why does nobody think to shoot the main characters, you know the people causing all this shit in the first place?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So how do I get the hotel perks from the CSR?  It says "amenities are subject to availability at the time of check-in/departure".  Will they do it automatically or do I have to request things?  If so, how do I do it?  "Hey, so can I get an upgrade because of my fancy ass credit card?" 

Any way to ensure I'll qualify for an upgrade?  What's the best hotel perk you've gotten with the CSR? </TEXT>
