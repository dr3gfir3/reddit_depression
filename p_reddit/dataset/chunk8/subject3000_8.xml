	<TEXT> This, I always use Tibiapedia to get to it. I was worried after a post earlier, but looks like I got lucky.

Never Google stuff like that, use official places to get to it.

And if you have to Google NEVER click on an ad/sponsored link </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With 3 clients going it must be a pain to keep all 3 up to date. Flash will be gone soon for sure, with its (adobe flash) diminishing support, and the fact AFAIK adobe flash will be completely discontinued itself.

So far I like Tibia 11, it still does feel a bit rough to me and the lag from forced DDoS protection is bad. I don't think they should discontinue Tibia 10 until Tibia 11 is as stable and runs as smooth for the vast majority of players though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have FB or it's messenger installed, unlike BattlEye there's no good reason them to have this invasive'ness besides to sell off the information to advertisers for a profit. That, to me, is unacceptable.

What BattlEye does, is acceptable and even needed for their purpose (FB doesn't need to datamine to fulfill it's purpose).

Not to mention FB actually collects a lot of data, unlike BattlEye where you really have little worry of anything being uploaded unless it's suspicious. Yes, botters will more than likely have their bots .exe's and maybe .dll's  uploaded, but hey you're botting you have to expect that from an anti cheat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This.

From what I read BattlEye is pretty invasive but it friggin works (lots of botters/developers try to discredit it or cause hyteria to push people to demand it's removal)

Despite being invasive they aren't wanting to watch everyone's 2 TB porn collection, or see their nudes. It's invasive to do its job, at worst you may end up with a .exe (or .dll) or two getting uploaded to them (if BattlEye  deems it as suspicious software).

For some people they will find this legitimately unacceptable, for me it's fine since I understand how these things work and know they really don't care about my personal files. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not banable, as others have said it's just registry changes (make it prioritize certain UDP or TCP packets over others, I'm not 100% sure of all the details I just understand the underlying concept).

When I lived in Wyoming, USA and had really bad DSL (like 10 mbps down, 812 kbps up) it shaved like 20 MS off my ping. In Washington state with really good cable internet it was unnoticeable. So YMMV, I'd give it a try. As long as you download from a legit source there's not much to lose, and it has an uninstall option (just reverts the registry entries back) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everytime I get a 20$ assistance fee I just call 611 and get it reimbursed. Same for sims, well to be fair I've only needed a new sim once and when I first switched the store gave them to me free.

Store employee even told me to call 611 everytime to get the assitance fee reimbursed via bill credit. 

As for customer service I only had trouble one time, which I know I'm REALLY lucky there.

The billing system is terrible though for sure, out of my own experience it is only 1 of 2 pain points. My second one is their website, maybe I'm really lousy at navigating it or something but if I'm looking for info, or a very specific FAQ it can be a pain finding it. Like so bad it'll literally give me a headache. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't find anything on the website mentioning the 50% ratio for One Plus International users with LTE hotspoting anymore. Has this been removed with this whole update or did they just move the information and I'm missing it?


Also looks like HD passes are a thing of the past now? I activated one right before reading this news and got an odd text

"Your unlimited HDPASS0 has been activated" is all it said and the website says I have 3010 days and 10 hours of HD pass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I may pick it up used, and buy a new copy to support the devs if/when I feel they 'deserve' it by providing enough via updates. I know there is a local game store near me that has them 10$ used. And I think I saw it used on Ebay for as cheap as 10$, if not lower. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I'm not trying to defend what they did. It was wrong and a huge problem with the video gaming industry right now. 

On the other, if a game development company does that, but tries their best to fix things through patch and updates I can get behind that. Which is why I was asking if it seems to be happening starting with the founders update. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know used it's really dirt cheap, but if I can pick it up new I'd prefer it to support the devs, assuming the updates they have provided are worth supporting them for. Basically it's that cheap new? When looking just recently cheapest I saw was 35$, which granted I may just not have looked hard enough.

I do like Minecraft, 7 Days To Die, and games like that so this is an interesting POV. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I, like many, was excited for this game but thankfully as a rule I never preorder.

Then of course the game launched, and like many, I wanted to cry but held hope with time and updates it'd become what it should of.

Basically, I know it's still not what was promised but has it gotten to the point where it's worth it? And I know this question will be very subjective, but hopefully some opinions can help me make up my mind. I've read as much as I can find about the update, and it seems it may, just may, be worth it now. </TEXT>
