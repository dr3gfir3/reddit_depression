	<TEXT> I don't think it's that simple. The project to restore the city and the temple has already took a lot of flack from the academics. The proper excavation of the palace ruins hasn't even started, and a haphazard and rushed excavation and restoration can be a disaster that damages the integrity and authenticity of the ruins. The gigantic 19th century Gyeongbok Palace reconstruction only took 3 years to complete. The restoration of that same palace has been going on for almost three decades, and it's far from finished. There will be a lot of controversies even after the restoration regarding the accuracy of the architecture. </TEXT>
