	<TEXT> Seems people like you will never get it no matter how many times its explained to you. This is not about Rush. Its about his huge audience which made Trump's impossible win possible, and now serves as the backbone of the revolutionary Trump movement which is threatening the entire global criminal order. It's about his words which resonate with so many people because they ring true. 

Its about the fact that I told everyone that this Russiagate narrative was going to get destroyed BEFORE it got destroyed. 

Now the top post on Reddit is a CNN propaganda piece featuring some irrelevant compromised politician opining that he thinks some Trump associates will be going to jail. I guess as soon as this "investigation"/attempted coup wraps up that'll happen and Trump the Russian agent will finally be cleared of any wrongdoing. Lmao </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since basically the Obama administration has sort of loaded this with these rule changes and all to allow for leaks the fact that there is no smoking gun of Trump administration collusion with Russia indicates that there isnt any. There is nothing substantial here because a juicy morsel like that would certainly have been leaked by the same people that have been leaking everything else. The fact it hasnt been leaked out means it does not exist, 
some of the Russia hysteria came from imputing sinister motives to conventional business dealings, arguing that Trumps organization made deals around the world, and it is exceedingly difficult to do business with any Russian entity that is not somehow connected to the Russian government.
It shows these people who are doing these gambits are relying on the relative ignorance of the American public of the actual nuts and bolts of intelligence to make their point. Anyone with any background in this stuff can see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to discredit an administration because they were crushed in the past elections.

	<TEXT> You've totally lost control of that narrative so all you can do is regurgitate the same lame talking point you heard parroted on Rachel Maddow and Erin Burnett as if people are too stupid to see through the bullshit. That argument doesnt hold any water. Just remember what I told you because you're all in for a very rude awakening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude you have no idea. I was on r/Christianity years ago under my shadowbanned account incessantly warning all the so called Christians and anyone who would listen about all the crazy biblical scale geopolitical happenings that are unfolding right now. They mocked me and banished me and even tried to label me a terrorist a kin to Al Qaeda. Now, unfortunatley I have no Christian fellowship of any kind on Reddit. Oh well they cant mock me now. At least not without sounding like fools. Anyone interested in that shadowbanned account can pm me and I'll send you down a rabbit hole like no other. Choosing the redpill in this instance may very well frighten some, I know. But at the end of this rabbit hole is your Eternal Salvation

	<TEXT> the CIA's secret documentary history of the U.S government's relationship with General Reinhard Gehlen, the German army's intelligence chief for the Eastern Front during World War II. At the end of the war, Gehlen established a close relationship with the U.S. and successfully maintained his intelligence network (it ultimately became the West German BND) even though he employed numerous former Nazis and known war criminals.

I think this is interesting given all the hysteria regarding the current US government possibly colluding with Russia. If our government was willing to collude with Nazi war criminals in the past to fight the Soviet Union, that must mean the Soviets were really evil, right? I mean, they must"ve had pretty good reason to work with Nazi's right? Could this part of American history help us better understand whats happening currently with our government possibly colluding with the Russians? </TEXT>
