Then he said he had this wonderful healthcare plan that would cover all Americans. Everyone knew that was all BS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL, the Republicans were the party of no for 8 years, Had they not been we wouldn't have  healthcare problem. What's this, like the 150th time they tried to repeal the bill?

Only 17% of voters wanted the repeal. 

Time to impeach Trump's whole group, but not over healthcare.

	<TEXT> I'm the right and I hate Trump.

No, the left Judges fucked up nothing. Trump fucked it up. Then after having a couple weeks to revise it he fucked it up again. He doesn't understand how things work. You can say it's a Muslim ban for years and then claim it isn't. This time around 2 judges squashed it. How long are you going to go around making excuses for this bozo? Trump said he had a secret plan to defeat iSIS in 30 days. He lied, and what Obama did has no relevance. Other than deporting a few people, he hasn't filled any campaign promises.

The cops wore what was given to them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of the cops wore vagina hats in solidarity. This may have started as a Planned parenthood protest but it grew into a general anti-Trump party.

It was about healthcare, education and many many more things. You need to come to the realization Trump is hated.

So far he's fucked up healthcare, a travel ban and defeating ISIS. He said he had a secret plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days. He's just a billionaire full of hot air. He said he would deport only bad people then turned around and deported a father of 6 who owned a business for 20 years. </TEXT>
