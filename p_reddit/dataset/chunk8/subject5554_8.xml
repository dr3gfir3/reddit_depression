There's the solution right there. If he's not getting fired, someone just needs to beat JBL's ass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only one that is ridiculous is Goldberg's return, and as a listener of his show he never actually claimed WWE did it to spite him, he just speculated that maybe that was a factor in the timing (since Goldberg was never discussed to come back during the time he was there). But even as a fan of his I thought that conspiracy theory was dumb as fuck.

But the rest of the claims are totally feasible. </TEXT>
