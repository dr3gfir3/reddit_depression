I just want to gain a normal amount of weight so bad. I want to have extra energy and fat when I get sick too! I can't talk to any girls bc no matter what I say, my problem is "lucky." I feel so alone.  Not being able to gain is as scary as gaining too much,  just in a different way.  SIGH. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I am SO angry at myself right now </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I go to a prestigious college which is pretty tough. That being said, I've always been really stressed but developed an anxiety disorder during my junior year and failed out of my program. I transferred to another program in school and was doing well..till now. I tried to take on a heavy course load to make up for the time I've been out of school dealing with anxiety. I was supposed to graduate in 5 weeks. Once again, anxiety reared its ugly head and screwed things up for me. I'm going to probably get a C in a class (Probably) and my GPA just can't handle that. Everyone is telling me to drop it and retake it in summer when I have more time to dedicate to it and I'm not taking 20 credits. I could do that but I'm SO SO SO scared what grad schools are going to think of me. I already had a problem with anxiety once before and had to Withdraw from 2 classes, how will a 3rd W on my transcript look. PROBABLY TERRIBLE. I've been SO SO anxious all day. I need to make a decision by the end of tomorrow and I'm just FREAKING OUT. I can't concentrate on homework at all. Either risk it and possibly get a C or B. Or just withdraw and definitely get a B or higher in summer. 
I'm so bummed about not graduating in 5 weeks. I feel like I've come so far with my anxiety and now I'm being set back again. I literally feel like there is no grad school that will EVER accept me. I  am SO angry at myself right now. Why couldn't I just handle it???? ARGH. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same situation but I'm the girl in this scenario. Definitely tell her you just can't be friends indefinitely. It hurt like hell when my best friend didn't tell me. I miss him but I can understand his feelings. But I also didn't get any closure so it hurts. I understand how you feel, but please just explain to her why you're doing it and talk with her one last time ( if you can bring yourself too.) She may not love you the way you wish, but don't think for one second she doesn't care deeply about you as a friend. That's my two cents.

	<TEXT> Im so sorry this happens!! As a really skinny person, I have often been asked "why are you even here? You don't need to exercise" when I go to the gym. I also get told "why are you eating a salad? Eat a burger or something" ( I happen to like vegetables a lot.) 
Point is, that people are rude and don't know your story or battle with body image. YOU KEEP DOING YOU.  Because everyone needs to exercise and eat delicious things once in a while! Be it a burger, salad, or whatever :') </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard this at least once for 3 days in a row and it bothers me a lot. I ate a canoli, had 2 beers, and  yesterday I kept on pulling snacks out every hour. Someone who I'd just met yesterday got pretty upset when I said having a hugh metabolism was a pain (she was a little on the chubby side.) But it's like hey, don't get mad at me, being super skinny has it's own set of problems too. They're just different. For instance, I don't have weight to lose if im sick. I have to almost be always constantly eating to keep up with my metabolism, I'm always hungery, I have to make sure to eat healthy bc I have no outside signs that junk food is bad for me. All I know is that in the long run, I'll regret it. I can't donate blood to my brother if he ever gets in an accident even though we have the same blood type of O-, sitting on hard surfaces is really uncomfortable because my butt is all bone and it hurts, I have to sometimes sleep with a pillow between my knees since I can feel my shin bones and it's uncomfortable when they touch. In short, don't underestimate skinny people problems. They are real for us too. Just a different set of problems. -_-

Damn you media!  Curves and skinny are both great, they need to stop always putting one down.

	<TEXT> So these were my top 10 thoughts regarding the Oscars. I really hope some of you were thinking the same things...

1. Lady gaga looks normal? WHAT IS HAPPENING??
2. Julie Andrews, I love you. So much.
3. NPH, imagine yourself giving a speech in front of a crowd who is in their underwear...oh wait, never mind then.
4. Emma Stone, YOU LOOK SO SEXY. Also she is a sly minx. She is sitting in the perfect seat where everyone on their way up to accept their Oscar hugs her. If there was such a thing, she would win the award for most hugged by Oscar winners.
5. How come I know more movie score artists than actual movie things? Alexander Desplat and Hans Zimmer, this is your fault.
6. I should be doing homework, but damn Idina Menzel look so good. Can Frozen win another Oscar just because.
7. Can Leonardo DiCaprio win an honorary Oscar? HE JUST NEEDS ONE. PLEASE.
8. Why are you telling me that "the Oscars will continue in a moment, here on ABC." I obviously know that since I'm watching these stupid ads on ABC.
9. I apparently really need to watch Interstellar, Boyhood, The Imitation Game, Theory of Everything, and American Sniper. These Bitches are winning everything up in here.
10. Graham Moore. "thank you Oparah, um I need to shower, um" AHAHA HE'S SO CUTE.

Edit: Must add an 11. Because Jesus, did someone just mention Kristen Stewart in a thank you speech? WHY???

	<TEXT> People who don't pay attention in class and then ask you 1 million questions.

I came home so annoyed today. I'm a senior at a good university. My classes are pretty hard and everyone expects that you get things on the first or second try. A lot of questions aren't asked. Today I'm sitting in class as we're learning A new computer system (I'm not an tech person so this was hard.) The three girls next to me are just talking on and on about who's dating who, and what color nail polish looks good with their shirts, and who's gonna cheat first, etc. while the professor is demonstrating how to use this system. When they learn that we have to turn in a guide for what we learned they start bothering the shit out of me to teach them how to do it when the professor is STILL lecturing. Then I MISS THE LECTURE because they won't stop bothering me, and now I  don't know what I'm doing. I end up asking professor during lecture, and everyone gets annoyed while girls continue to gossip, and the vicious cycle continued for 3 hours. JUST PAY ATTENTION. DAMN.
