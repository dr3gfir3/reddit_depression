	<TEXT> The only thing wrong, and I'm nitpicking but I see it all too often now, is the face Goldberg had when he gave the championship to the ring crew. This small detail let me know that it was over for him. For my taste, I'd say a champion should convey being proud, being afraid, being happy or not giving a fuck. To be sad is not an acceptable emotion before a title match (with exception to story). Other than that this was expertly booked! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes yes, sadly the trailers were a bit misleading. I'm not sure that fits the category I'm looking for. The opening scene was enough for me to forgive the throw off. Tarintino's later films (Kill Bill is his action masterpiece) are mostly dialogue with action peaks. I believe the turn came from the grindhouse film, Deathproof. </TEXT>

You take a great character like Darth Vader, who's background is shady at best, then you make him anything but a bad ass and the mythos of the character falls apart.

	<TEXT> There's three basic punches I believe. The open hand punch, the forearm punch and the punch hand punch.  

Open Hand- The striker will hit their opponent with an open fist.  

Forearm: This is what we see a lot nowadays. The forearm was used to simulate a cross or hook punch.  

Punch Hand Punch: The striker puts their hands on their opponent and strikes the hand. I've usually seen this used by wrestlers to gain control of a match.  

Here's a few links:

	<TEXT> Ouch! But so true =(   I just don't get why they think anime (regardless of its origins) would make a decent live action movie.  

I like the concept of Dragon Ball Z, but don't want to see shitty (or even decent) special effects of purple haired Michael Cera with a sword. Then the next thing would be to change the aesthetics (like say Goku goes Super Sayan but his hair doesn't get big, it just gets blonde) but that would have hardcore fans screaming outrage.  

Has there been any good anime to live action movies? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love big idea movies! InTime, where time replaces money; The Purge, where crime is legal for one day. These movies gained most of their views through casting and unique premises. Always on the look out for more movies, I'm asking r/movies which movies they think have good premises but poor execution.  

A counter-example of goof premise and good execution would be something like Tucker and Dale vs. Evil; Cabin in the Woods; The Time Traveler's Wife. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The highlight promo of Raw is Reigns coming out to a chorus of boos. He states that this is his yard now. Then his opponent for the next pay per view comes out. It's none other than AJ Styles.  

Payback: Roman gives AJ one heck of a beating, getting in the Superman Punch before a Phenomenal Forearm. Roman gets the pin 1,2,3. AJ Styles holds out his hand for Reigns to shake. Roman takes a bit, but shakes it nonetheless.  

The next ppv, Extreme Rules, is going to be KO against The Big Dog. The build up is KO trying to end Reigns career with weapons. There's a stipulation added, if KO wins he gets a rematch for the Universal Title from Lesnar (who hasn't been seen for some time). The United States Championship is on the line.    

Extreme Rules: KO beats the crap out of Reigns. Everything Reigns throws at KO is blocked and returned with chairshots, kendo sticks and stairs. Reigns goes out on his back, injured and broken.  

 Reigns stays off the air for a few months. During this time Roman does a shitload of charity work, goes to a concert and headbangs to some internet smarky music (Reigns likes Hairbands!? Me too), he does an expose all interview with Oprah that really shows him as human and likable. SummerSlam comes right around the corner.  

SummerSlam: Braun Strowman is put up against Sheamus. Roman's music hits; HE'S BACK!!! Reigns SP both men, then he asks the crowd which one they want by holding his thumb sideways, whichever man gets the thumbs down gets it!  Reigns uses his new finisher, a tiger bomb! Reigns tiger bombs the first man, then he shrugs and tiger bombs the other one too.  

Reigns gets a mouthpiece when he's back. For the most part he stands there, looks intimidating and lets his manager talk. He chimes in with minimal words and catchphrases here and there.  

Night of Champions: Roman gets in a match with Braun and Sheamus. He doesn't decimate them. controls the match's pace. Neither man can get over Reigns...then Roman wins with another new maneuver: Walls of Jericho STF. The announcers say that Roman calls it, "The Column Collapser" or soemthing like that. The tiger bomb can be called The Empire's End, or something lol. Reigns puts Braun in the submission and forces him to tap out.  

Something happens to Braun during the match. He's not as sure of himself. He's actually scared to be in the same ring with Reigns. Every time they try to get a rematch going, Braun rolls out for the count out. Reigns wants to fight, but Braun isn't having it. This leads to a Hell in the Cell match.  

Hell in a Cell: It's Braun against Roman in Hell in a Cell grudge match! Braun tries to escape. Roman tosses him back in the ring. Braun gets the upper hand; eventually escapes the Cell then climbs to the top. Roman follows, he tries to tiger bomb Braun, but Braun reverses it, sending Roman through the top of the cage through the ring below. Braun climbs down from the cell. Roman climbs out of the hole, tries to get in some offense, but Braun gives Reigns the finisher. 1,2, Reigns kicks out! A few manuevers later and Braun is back in the Column Collapser! Braun taps out again! Roman wins his feud with the strongman.  

For Survior Series, Roman is captain of the team: Reigns and The New Day. Reigns and Day win leading to some fun celebrations, letting Reigns show a bit of humor.

Reigns' mouthpiece speaks up, now that they're done with Braun there's one more person that Roman needs to settle the score with...Brock Lesnar. There's one problem though, Seth Rollins wants the main event at Mania.  Samoa Joe speaks up and he too would enjoy the main event at Wrestlmania. This leads to a match for chance to face Lesnar at the Rumble.

Roadblock: Reigns is put in a triple threat match against Samoa Joe and Seth Rollins, though Reigns gets in some good offense, Samoa Joe proves to be the better fighter, which gives him the chance to compete for the title at Royal Rumble (Joe vs Lesnar).  

After Roadblock, Heyman and Lesnar return to TV. Joe and Lesnar work a program, meanwhile Reigns and his mouthpiece focus on training for the Rumble. Reigns is on TV, but in vignettes. He's seen punching bags, lifting weights, running and other workout things. During the segments (which can be funny or informative) Reigns instructs the viewers on how to work out, proper form, reps, etc. (trying to cover r/fitness lol); he gives slight nods to internet fans here and there and generally comes across as trying to help. One week on Raw he finds that he's pulled Number 1 for the Rumble.  

Royal Rumble: During the Royal Rumble, Reigns doesn't lay in a corner, he delivers Superman Punches and spears, and at one point it's just him in the ring waiting for the next entrant. He even tiger bombs some people over the top rope. It gets down to Braun Strowman, Randy Orton,KO and Reigns. Strowman gets scared out of the ring, Orton gets tossed by KO. Reigns and KO exchange strong style type forearms in the center of the ring. KO goes for the pop-up, but Reigns Superman Punches him. Reigns wins the Royal Rumble, hopefully with the crowd behind him at this point. Lesnar retains the title.  

At Fastlane, Reigns decimates his opponent in record time. Maybe a tag team member. This is crucial for Mania.  

With WM around the corner, Reigns' moutpiece and Heyman have all the material they need. "My client, Brock Lesnar was the first to beat the streak of the Undertaker." "My client, Roman Reigns, beat the Undertaker so bad he had to retire." and so forth. In an act of bravado, Reigns burns The Undertaker's clothes.  

Wrestlemania: Roman gets a hell of an entrance. Brock comes out with the championship. The match is more like an MMA match, with Roman and Lesnar both trying to get their submissions on each other. The finish is Roman rolling out of a German into the Column Crusher. Lesnar taps out, making Roman Reigns champ.

	<TEXT> I'm pretty happy (and very sad) to see Reigns become a legend by ending Undertaker's career. Reigns is a future legend himself, if given the opportunity I'm sure most aspiring wrestlers would love to be where Reigns is at company wise.  

Lesnar and Goldberg had a fun match! Can't wait for the Lesnar/Reigns rematch!  

Wyatt and Orton started out great...then the projections didn't lead anywhere. Randy is a terrible worker and doesn't deserve a title. I just don't get why he gets pushed so hard. I've never seen him deliver in any match, big or small. He mostly sells, his psychology is wait wait wait, RKO. I just don't get his appeal.  

Rollins and Hunter was a classic! Not the motn but one that will be remembered fondly! I think I wasn't as hyped for this one because of the poor build up, to me it just seemed a bit forced. I didn't like Hunter's old man cart entrance.  

Raw Women was going well until Nia Jax was eliminated, then it wasn't that good. Now should be champ imho, Bayley has merch but I find her a bit lackluster.  

SDL Women's was pretty fun! Always love a Naomi entrance, and that ending was pretty good!  

Hardys reverse retirement match might be the greatest WM pop of all time! Wish there was a way for them to be kept secret, imagine if there was no buzz!  

KO vs Jericho was a solid workhorse match. Would have been better if the Universal title was on the line.  

AJ and Shane had one of the best matches I've seen! I was talking shit about Shane's punches then he elbowed AJ and I shut up. That 450 into the sub was fantastic!  

Ambrose and Corbin man, I'm trying to remember anything but the end, can't. That end was great though!  

ARMBAR- eh, okay. Fuck Shaq for not showing up, I was hyped for the battle of the giants! </TEXT>
