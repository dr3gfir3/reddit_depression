	<TEXT> Why you are ranting about biasness. This isn't post about India. Bringing India would be considered as trolling. And I see you are putting India's incident of killing about cows and comparing with these incidents. So you are justifying that Pakistan's Muslim should kill Pakistan's Hindus because such a cases are happening in India.really? You are bringing more shame to Pakistan than those who are committing such a things. 

Are you a shill account used by Indians to bring *clever* shame to Pakistan? Modibots? Stop trolling. It justify that you guys wanna censor such news. </TEXT>
