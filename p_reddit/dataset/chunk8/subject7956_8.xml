IMO its certainly a forgery esp Considering the very next passage start with..

About the same time also another calamity put the Jews into disorder,

And Calamity here is a reference to that aqueduct riot which was brutally surpassed by Pilate and described by Josephus just before TF. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They took much time in covering the basics and esp poor performance by Price who looks to me was not much involved or prepared for this debate, he answered some questions very carelessly and he didn't even quiz Ehrman in Cross-questioning round and wasted too much time in giving pop culture references.

And Ehrman too sometime run a string of misleading statements like, he said that we don't have any narratives on life of Josephus, forgetting he had written a autobiography(Life of Flavius Josephus or Life) and then he said that we don't have extra-biblical information about Pilate in first century and don't know why he even quite foolishly compared Pauline epistles to Letters from his own mother.

Overall a disappointing debate if you hold Mythicism viewpoint. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't get how you can call Gospels poetic they read up like some amateur fiction, both Matthew and Luke are not original composition they're just a [rehashed](http://www.progressiveinvolvement.com/.a/6a00d8341c3e3953ef01310f9a7fce970c-400wi) version of Mark, but yeah Mark was good, nearly brilliant and thoroughly entertaining, but only if you discard it's written about a real historical individual called Jesus.

	<TEXT> Gospels are anonymous documents, the tradition that they were written by disciples of Jesus is a later one and it has no sound basis in reality, as for sources its now widely agreed that both Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source ie. Markan Priority, sometimes even copying him verbatim and a separate saying source called 'Q' which doesn't contains any narratives on life of Jesus.

And there are insurmountable differences between John and Synoptics, scholars regards it as a least historical, thoroughly fictitious narrative. </TEXT>

An estimate.

So it's just bull**.

so is Paul's mentions of Jesus.

Paul doesn't speak of a Jesus who was a disciple of JtB, who preached around sea of Galalie and crucified by Pilate, he knows a Preexistent son of god who was crucified by Rulers of this Age and afterwards communicating with them via revelations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We will have to regard about 95% of all ancient figures as "mythical" , We rarely have "contemporaneous accounts", We also have none at all for any of the other early first century Jewish preachers

Where do you get that 95% figure?, Granted contemporaneous written accounts are not common but they're not exactly very rare, we have contemporary account of Pilate by Philo of Alexandria and as for Jewish preachers, Josephus' narrative of Jesus ben Ananias will qualify for a contemporary account. </TEXT>

Its not a wishful thinking RC has cited recent studies, go and read them and he's not alone, even Louis Feldman who's a renown Josephan scholar thinks that TF was a later interpolation.
