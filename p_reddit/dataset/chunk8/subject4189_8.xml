	<TEXT> What he means is the pay should be based on performance, work rate, and tenure. It's a fair point. Look at it through his perspective, not only did he make less guaranteed money after getting shuffled down the card, he also made less merch money (because he wasn't as prominent in the storylines, and also heels sell less merch than faces.) That stuff is largely out of a guy's control - you do the jobs they tell you to do and then your paychecks shrink because of it.

He's elaborated this more on his podcast and subsequent interviews but people just cherry pick the clips from that and act as if all he does is bitch. He doesn't. He's actually a pretty good dude who loves his fans (talks about positive faninterractions al the time), tells old backstage and on the road stories, and gives his take on current events </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His podcast is great. The guy was around for one of my favorite periods in wrestling and tells so many backstage stories about Vince, Bryan, and countless other people. He's a positive guy who really likes his fans and he puts on a good show every week. It's also a show that goes into details on how Indy wrestling works and how lucrative (or not) that it can be. You think people on here would love that, but no, let's hate it because it's Ryaback and we have to be cool. People's reason for hating him are dumb and the fucking people who've misquoted his whole equal pay thing is fucking dumb </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, I went through my notes in my phone and I forgot that I saved it so here you go:

[The spaceship Covenant is transporting frozen embryos to a human colony on a faraway planet when they receive a distress signal from Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), from the Prometheus expedition, which disappeared 10 years prior. The crew is brought out of hypersleep to answer to the signal, which leads to the death of the Covenant's captain, Branson (James Franco). His wife, Daniels (Katherine Waterson), is deeply affected by the accident, while Branson's first officer Archer (Billy Crudup) is made captain. The Covenant is piloted by Daniels's friend Tennessee (Danny McBride) and the crew is aided by an android, Walter (Michael Fassbender).] (#spoiler)

[The Covenant follows Shaw's signal to Paradise, an uncharted forest planet and homeworld of the Engineers, the ancient extraterrestrials that seeded life on Earth and then sought to the destroy it. The Engineers' secret weapon, the black ooze, has spread through Paradise, turning it into a wasteland. The Covenant's crew ventures outside their ship and some of its members are exposed to spores released by plants infected by the ooze. It is determined they've contracted an alien pathogen and Archer has them quarantined aboard the Covenant.] (#spoiler)

[Monstrous creatures known as "Neomorphs" burst from the infected crewmen's bodies and begin slaughtering the crew, forcing the survivors to flee into the forest, where they are rescued from the Neomorphs by David (Michael Fassbender), the sole survivor of the Prometheus crew. He reveals that Shaw sacrificed herself to crash a spaceship against Paradise's surface, exposing the Engineers to the black ooze to prevent them from destroying Earth, leaving him stranded on Paradise.] (#spoiler)

[David leads the survivors back to the Engineers' derelict citadel, where he's been living ever since. Walter mistrusts David, who is not behaving in accordance with their programming, and finds out that David in fact murdered Shaw. David's mind has been warped by the numerous modifications that his creator, Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), made to his programming during the Prometheus's expedition, and is obsessed with creating the "perfect organism". He exposed numerous lifeforms on Paradise, including Shaw, to the black ooze and, after numerous failed attempts, has created an alien egg, which produces a facehugger that latches itself to Archer, leading to the birth of a Primal Xenomorph.] (#spoiler)

[Daniels and Tennessee realize David is controlling the Neomorphs and escape back to the Covenant with Walter in order to leave Paradise. Together, Daniels and Tennessee manage to kill the Primal Xenomorph and the Neomorphs and detonate explosives to destroy David's laboratory, with David himself apparently perishing in the explosion.] (#spoiler)

[After escaping, Daniels and Tennessee place themselves back in hypersleep to continue their voyage to the colony, unaware that David has killed Walter and stolen his identity to leave Paradise. David secretly plants two alien egg embryos among the human frozen embryos that the Covenant is transporting to proceed to the next phase of his experiment.] (#spoiler)

[Possibly the next movie will show how engineers were not THE benevolant higher power beings we wanted them to be,they were just a race being pawns of another higher race or higher power but stronger and a lot more advanced within the same race.The engineers we see in lv 223 and 426 are not the same we will see in covenant. The covenant ones are not as advanced...they are like a "primal indigenous" version of the true engineers who mastered the black goo chemical,this engineers are evil and the next sequels will cover more about them and what the black goo is trully capable of,i heard the idea we will follow is that the xenomorph as we know it was never the ultimate organism just one of the variations of the very first "creature" the chemical was made off, at this moment we see the xeno as the big bad beast(queen mostly) but i believe we will have another one to worship as the true perfect organisms.] (#spoiler)

	<TEXT> I didn't mind it. The difference between Braun and Corbin is that they've given Corbin a few losses and he's bounced back. Not to say that Braun hasn't with his one against Roman but Barron they seem to give more nuance to his character with his losses. He's only lost to 3 top guys. One was clean (Cena), one was dirty (Orton, and I feel that that was done to protect a possible title feud down the line), and the latest one was clean (Dean), but this was more of a case of losing the battle but winning the war.

I also have a feeling that Corbin will be Cena's return feud.

As great as they've handled Braun, his purpose is to ultimately put over Roman. And the writing has been on the wall since the brand split. Whether he makes it or breaks it after that is comeplety on the writing team, but the guy has proved he had staying power over the past 6 months. I hope they don't give him the usual giant treatment </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She's not even that good on the mic. She's serviceablly better than the rest of the women who aren't good at all. Especially on Smackdown. That promo she did when she is in the ring alone before they announced what she was doing at Mania was complete dog shit </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like I said, they're all good with each other. Not one of them has had a match better than 'ok' outside of their inner circle. Which doesn't make them great to me. HBK could make a broom look good. The only one who I can say that I'm a fan of on the mic and in the ring and I do think has that spark that interests me and has put in work is Charlotte. But a lot of that is because she's been given the most and protected more than the other 3.

Comepletley disagree with you on Alexa Bliss </TEXT>

He then played the different recordings that he had on his phone of the way he would say nigger </TEXT>
