	<TEXT> Yeah, and the women who don't wear makeup are just "ugly cunts" according to MGTOW standard.

So yeah, y'all find women repulsive in general, don't you fuckin' say it's makeup's fault because it's not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe because we expect women to look better more than men in a way or another (ie makeup and such) and as they get older they stop caring so much about this, and thus it looks like they aged faster? :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom was abandoned by her father when she was 9.

He just visited her again when she was 37 because he had stuff to do back where we lived and nobody else accepted him at home.

She was more than glad when he left. She just accepted him out of pity as no one wanted to see him again. So yeah, be this dad, RPers; be the kind of dad your kids get so scared of during childhood that they develop stuttering problems, the one that goes away from home to live with your plate and, years later, wonders why none of your children like you and why they want you as away as possible. *Dew it*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My aunt did a research on that a long time ago, so I also am not exactly sure. She did write down most of what she could find, though, and it dates back to the second half of 1700s.

Either way, I'll try to ask my aunt later on. I am aware that the first part was done from anecdotal evidence from her grandmother + evidence on the Immigration Museum on So Paulo (they can help you with Italian ancestors. Actually, with Japanese, too, but I have none, so :P). Also, some of her cousins still had the surnames of the ancestors on the family, which on that later stage were pretty much the Ratti(s). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously, who gives a fuck about that?

I mean, sure, I can get one searching for their lineage (I myself did, and that's why I know an angry Italian lady and a Russian Jew guy married on my family that brought up what would be the ancestors of my father later on), but... *for this*? What a fuckin' waste of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, he didn't go to that side. He talked more about my personality and personal taste. And my hair, which he found cool :^D

My boss just "wat"d and apologised for this guy's behaviour around that after he left. It wasn't really something that made me angry after all, so, yeah. 

What makes me angry is an older man who goes there AND tries to act that way around me and refuses to take any tech advice taken by me because I'm a woman :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> defending Islam

That is something I also disagree with. I mean, sure, I can get the point of free will of religion choices, but some things on it should be changed indeed. But eh, I also think my own religion should change, lol

As for the wage gap, maybe it's not very noticeable where you live, but here it's pretty easy to notice. See my high school teachers for once: my female math teacher had a doctorate on math and worked for about the same time as my male teacher (who had just a master's degree while she had both) and received less, and she didn't have kids. But yeah, it's not present on all fields.

Either way, as some people said here, you can be a feminist and not agree with everything on it. I met feminists who didn't defend abortion, as an example. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I've seen these ones, too, but nah, they're fortunately not the "biggest bunch" there. And well, the ones I've seen were often argued with by the other users on that sub.

Also, the "greatest posts" there do talk about feminism. Indeed there are some who disagree with it, but once again, most people do because of biase/"Tumblr Feminists". Hell, for a long time I myself fit into that description, and still feel uneasy about calling myself one (and don't do) because of the backlash it brings. So, yeah, I agree with some stuff of it but don't call myself one because of that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heh, an old friend of mine (don't see him in a long time, though) also had a thing for short hair. His girlfriend often told him she wanted to cut it short and he agreed with that, but she never cut it in fear of being "less feminine". lol </TEXT>
