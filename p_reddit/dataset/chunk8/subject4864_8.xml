	<TEXT> There are plenty of bad stories here and good ones as well, as I am sure you've bee reading since you got on here. Find yourself a mentor(s) who will take you under their wing. Always be humble, you have no idea what you do not know yet. This place is full of new CCNAs who are ready to redesign the Internet - the technology equivalent of a student who just finished psychology 101 want to diagnose their friends and family. The more humble you are the more willing people will be to teach you. 
You do not have to do this yourself. Post here often and learn to read through the chaff. Rant as well, we're in a business where we have to sell complex techical decisions to people who don't care to understand what we're talking about. Don't bother trying to impress your non-technical bosses with things they'll never understand. Always learn to communicate with them in their language  (money, productivity, etc.) Good luck and welcome! </TEXT>
