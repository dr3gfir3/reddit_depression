	<TEXT> Trump is hardly the first president to discover that what sounds good on the campaign trail doesnt always work in the Oval Office. But Trump, who came into office with no experience in government, has been unusually unabashed in his reversals. On North Korea, for example, Trump told the Journal that he had shifted his view after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week. After listening for 10 minutes, I realized its not so easy, Trump told the Journal. I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power [over North Korea]  but its not what you would think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Goldman Sachs runs the economy; Jeff Sessions runs civil rights.

Over the course of the past few weeks, Sessions has indicated a desire to roll back civil rights oversight of abusive police departments, stampeded over states objections to immigration enforcement raids at courthouses, dropped efforts to improve forensic science, directed federal prosecutors to dedicate a larger share of their resources to deporting immigrants, launched a new crackdown on high-tech guest worker visas, and indicated a desire to bring back old-school war on drugs policies, including a stepped-up federal crackdown on marijuana use. </TEXT>

I don't think Netflix ever did that for any show, so I am not really concerned about that. But yeah I will not wait that long. Just wondered if I could support it by buying it. Apparently not.  </TEXT>

It does not look good for Julian when Trump's CIA direction says stuff like this. Hopefully they do not try to smoke him out of the embassy.

Now that they actually govern they are just common neocon Republicans. 
Trump did a 180 on like 5 campaign promises this week alone.

Blink, and you missed Trump's blistering, seamless transformation into a mainstream politician.

	<TEXT> I consume mostly the usual suspects for Breaking News like  [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/news) and [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/).

Furthermore I like some data-driven journalism for example by [Ezra Klein](https://twitter.com/ezraklein) who writes vor [Vox](http://www.vox.com/) and [Nate Silver](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538) of [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). What I enjoy about them is that it mostly about some data and how it can be interpreted. Some pieces by them are hit or miss, but in general it is good. 

For the political stuff, mostly coming out of Washington I started to like [Politico](http://www.politico.com/). Some of their articles are very into details and some discuss rumors floating around the halls of congress, but if so they are not sold as fact, so I quite enjoy it. 

And finally for the pieces with a lot of background info that go really into depth, I read [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/).

Obviously it possible to come across a lot of good stuff on reddit, too. Sometimes on the big subreddits, but also in deeper corners like /r/TrueReddit. In the sidebar of /r/TrueReddit you can find some more subs that post more indepth-stories.  </TEXT>

For breaking news I have the [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/news) App (although I heard the one from the [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/) is supposed to be better), which is decent.
I also follow [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) on facebook, so I get exposed to breaking news there, too. They have very good writers.

I cannot agree more to that last statement. I am guilty of this addictive behavior too from time to time. And I am not sure if the internet makes of all of this worse or just makes visible things that were always there.  </TEXT>

But you are right. NYT and WaPo are not the ones I want to critizise. They have real journalist there that uncover true stories and both have rightfully gotten a Pulitzer prize for their coverage of Trump this year. 

Some of their editorials can be questionable, but their journalism is the gold-standard.  </TEXT>

Puh I think you will not get far with this unless billions sign up. I think there is already a lot of good journalism out. It just looses out because people rather put their limited attention towards easily digestable sensationalist bullshit. 
In most countries of the world, the biggest, best-selling newspaper is a tabloid. And always has been.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely do not think 'alternative' media is any better. Mostly they are worse. The best journalists still work at the best (msm) newspapers. 
I never wanted to give away the impression I have something against main stream media. I only have something against sensationalism and clickbait journalism. And I fear our behaviour drives the msm towards that because it is the only way they can make money.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would think that upvotes and clicks are correlated. The more upvotes something has, the more people see and the more likely it is to get clicked. 

But you are right, the problem are clicks. So even when I click something to find out why it is wrong it helps the ones who wrote it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously /r/the_donald is a completely different beast in terms of misinformation and shitty journalism. In /r/politics there is sometimes clickbait being upvoted among high quality reports, whereas /r/the_donald is devoid of any journalistic standards at all and the most ridiculous bullshit gets upvoted as long is pushes a certain agenda. They are not comparable, you are right. I guess I instinctly went the CNN way to appeal to everyone. Guilty of false equivalence.
