	<TEXT> I know there is no proof, but when you get grabbed in a certain way and you see the expressions on their faces... believe me, I knew. I just didn't want to stick around long enough to find out for real... And thank you, I think I was pretty lucky, too!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually that was my 2nd thought, after the one about cracking their heads, when I could think straight again, that is. And then I had to admit I didn't remember anything, apart from that guy's hat... which is ridiculous... And it was pretty dark, due to the only street lamp nearby... There's another thing, too, our police doesn't bother with these things at all. Either you take care of your ass, or you go down, sadly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, it was self-defence, my point was, if the bigger of them grabbed me, he might as well have overpowered me, you know? It's why I think I was lucky. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, really, this was the greatest fright I've ever experienced. I've heard about people doing incredible things when adrenaline and self-preservation instinct kick in, now I know what they mean! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couldn't be, when he grabbed me we were already face to face.. though it is possible.. and all I could remember from the whole encounter was his hat... made from wool, covering his ears.... human memory is weird. </TEXT>
