	<TEXT> What Linux distros have you tried? Start with Ubuntu, as it most user friendly. You can also install it in dual mode until you are comfortable making it your primary OS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Skip Manali at all cost- it is one of the most touristy places in India.

You should checkout [Indiahikes](https://indiahikes.com/) for treks. They are one of the *good guys*, who charge reasonably, have lot of planned treks of varying difficulty, take care of the ecosystem and have lot of experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This must have been true a few years ago, but not any more. A few Linux distros now actually have beautiful UI and are built with average users in mind. I guess it's all about finding a distro that works well for *you*. </TEXT>

You mean, *you* know, right? My next door neighbor who uses a computer just to browse Facebook doesn't know about Linux or that Linux will serve her just fine. So *fuckboy*, stfu. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been slacking from work for a few weeks now. It's Saturday night right now and I am hoping to get some work before going to sleep.

Also, girlfriend is here and I think she's a bit horny tonight wink

Why not put on some music? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care about encrypted emails that much. I care more about the fact that Protonmail doesn't go through my emails, so it doesn't build a profile on me to serve ads. In other words, I like that it respects my privacy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am planning to move away from Google Chrome to a Chromium-based browser. Vivaldi looks great, but it is concerning that I can't sync my browser settings, or at least extensions and bookmarks.

What do you guys use? How does, say, Iridium compare to Vivaldi? Is there a decent way to sync (at least) extensions and bookmarks from Vivaldi? </TEXT>
