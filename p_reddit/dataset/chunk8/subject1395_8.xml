	<TEXT> I worked for a bit audio equipment company for a few years and a super common request was "I know you guys don't repair these old speakers anymore but would a third party fix it?" And the answer was usually "How rich are you?" I learned a lot about this kind of stuff just by messing with old equipment. If you are super serious about rebuilding this cabinet, go find some old trash speakers and experiment with them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly there aren't really many places that do this kind of thing for a reasonable price. If you have any diy experience, take it apart and separate some of the parts. You can experiment a bit with the cabinet without doing any damage. Find some cheap speakers and pull them apart. Get a feel for what parts these things have.  </TEXT>

[Here's the cable I use](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R11WPK4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s03?ie=UTF8 psc=1).

It's a bit weird because you need to remove the cable and the little molex connector thing from the headphones. I took the bare filament wires and soldered them to the connector. It's got a joined ground, so don't let that confuse you. I have a [picture of the connecter](https://i.redditmedia.com/kt2rE1REPIQjfp5-EMD3u2ENa7xvsGJZUEjTzqk4pmU.jpg?w=576 s=56fc34547ee8a0d3989b935bfb4cb8c1) here.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Room for rent in medford right by tufts </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-12 20:32:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm moving out of my apartment on Quincy St and I am looking for someone to take over the lease from April 1 to Aug 31 of this year. It is a great spot - about 7-10 minute walk from Tufts campus. It is a big apartment, too - 3 other roommates (2 guys, 1 girl), spread over 2 floors, 2 bathrooms. They are all 25-30 or so working in the area. This room is on the same floor as the girl roommate, the common area, and the kitchen. She is extremely kind and clean and quiet. Also, free washer and dryer in basement. The apartment also has a big storage room in the back and a second-floor porch. The room itself is maybe 15'x11'. 


The reason I am moving out is because my girlfriend and I don't have a lot of room. It's just big enough for our 2 desks, a dresser, a full bed, a large ikea bookshelf with a tv on top... so if you're 1 person looking for a good size room, there's plenty of space. Good sized closet and one window. 


It's 937.50 a month plus utilities, which are reasonable as they're split between roommates. No first/last/security! SUPER responsive and nice management company, plus direct access to the landlords as well! Driveway parking for one car, free parking up the street too. 


Really nice spot, 15 minutes from Davis (or the 94/96 buses down the street go there), close to like eight different take-out places, 10 minutes from Stop   Shop and Whole Foods. 


Happy to send you pictures or give you a tour. Let me know if you have any questions! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I went the last three years and I have been less into it each year. I think it was more exciting when it was smaller - more interesting booths, more swag, more social opportunities. Last year I spent most of my time hanging out with friends and playing board games. If you have a group, it's great. If not, don't buy more than one day. Honestly the one thing I like the most is that you can join a D D game or LFG around the board game area. 

There are some demo booths that are cool, but it's rarely worth waiting an hour to play 10 minutes of a sub-AAA game. 

As for the LAN thing, there's a chance, as there is a free-pc sort of area, but I have never tried it, so I don't know if you'd have any more luck there than just posting on /r/boston or craigslist...

As for me, I am horrible at RTS, or I would take you up on it :) </TEXT>

Annie's Clark Brunch - next to Clark and it will change your life. 

Nicks - German style bar near Kelly Square. Best bartenders in the city. 

That's Entertainment - If you are a nerd about anything, this place is incredible. 

Da Lat - tiny Vietnamese place, super cool peoples and great food (lots of Vietnamese in Worcester, I hope you like Pho)

Mass Liquors - great liquor store - small but great. 

Crompton Collective - Cool antique-ish art/furniture store. Cool stuff if you're decorating. 

I'm sure there are more. I lived in Worcester for 7-8 years and I love the place. Let me know if you have more questions.  </TEXT>

From the Wiki:

A fickle queen gave them life, and tore off their faces. How else could she forgive those who dared gaze upon her? The peculiar art of puppetry is a vestige of the two lost lands. A queen breathed life into these dolls with the very miasma that afflicted her poison-drenched bosom, so that she would have slaves to serve her temperamental will.[1]
These advanced puppets were given life by the Baneful Queen, and she uses them to lure unsuspecting fools into her traps. Once upon a time, the Manikins had heads, but the Queen ripped off their faces in a fit of rage. Watch yourself, or yours will be next.[2]

Also I know they were featured prominently in the DS2 trailer, and they used to have masks, but those were pulled in development. Maybe significant? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't seen anyone hypothesize about it as a puppet instead of a statue. Yes, it's in an alcove, but statues aren't generally built to be flexible - or dressed in cloth. Could it be that people were tricked into falsely worshiping a figure (maybe Gwyndolin) to some other effect? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's doable if you're on your first run. The game doesn't really cap your level, so unless you want to stop leveling at a certain point (for PvP), you can invest some souls in magic to see how you feel about it. Keep in mind, you need Int for Sorceries, Faith for Miracles, and Attunement just to equip spells. You'd need to put a lot of points into those to get good at casting, so it's a lot of souls. Usually you can get similar ranged-cheese-abilities with a bow/crossbow as a melee character without dumping so many points.  </TEXT>
