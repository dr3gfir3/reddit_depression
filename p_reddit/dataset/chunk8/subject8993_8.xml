	<TEXT> The rep in the chat I believe was not breaking down the unlimited plan. But breaking down the previous bill. The rep quoted $40 for the plan which is obviously not correct for unlimited.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you think that chat rep gained from giving blatantly wrong information? 

Are mistakes going to be made? Of course. However to think that reps are maliciously lying makes no sense. Even commission based sales rep have little to gain from "blatant lies" as things will be returned and they will (yes it will happen if they are being malicious) get fired.  </TEXT>

Looks like the rep looked at your previous bill and listed the itemized charges. And then you asked what plan you're on, having at that point I guess switched to unlimited? So he said unlimited.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, you probably can't pick a worse time to consider corporate but here are the good and the bad:


Good
----
- solid base + commission 
- outstanding benefits
- $8k for tuition 
- lots of perks (discounts, etc) 
- relatively flexible schedule considering its retail 

Bad
----
- not much chance for advancement currently since they are downsizing 
- quotas can be (will depend on a lot of factors) quite high which can be stressful and force you to be cold calling to try to generate sales 
- general retail shitty-ness (hours, dealing with morons, etc) 



I've been at Verizon for 2 years now, and it was great until the last 3-4 months. They have been an absolute grind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you explained makes sense as a concept but no way it makes sense on paper. 

Let's make it easy and say the phone 7 costs $750. 

So you'd have to pay off $275 more to pay off 50% of the phone. Then you finance the cheapest phone possible (K4), which is $120 (+$30 upg fee). Then you buy a iPhone 6 maybe? For like... $250. 

Now you've paid $675 not including taxes to get out of the iPhone 7 that would have cost you $650 more. 



Just keep the iPhone 7 and decide once you organically get to 50% if another nice phone is worth it to you.  </TEXT>

If they give you hard time, ask if they have a test sim. Assuming you're at a corporate store they may have one. If they don't have that, assure them that you are positive it can work if they can just give you an active sim.

	<TEXT> Are they identical though? For Verizon our prepaid models have fewer lte bands and less memory. 

For example, J3 - 

$168 on postpaid 

J3 prepaid is $99 but half the memory  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's easy to compare when you don't count no signal against you. 

I live right in DC and I cannot use my tmo phone if I'm more than 10ft inside the building. However, if I stand outside I get a nice 60mbps on tmo... Yet somehow cannot stream anything without buffering still.

	<TEXT> Did the customer agree to the price? Yes. Was the price accurate? Yes. If the customer has questions about the line by line charges can he ask questions? Yes. Did he? No. 

Who are you to say it's not a benefit. Obviously OP wanted a tablet in some regard or he would have declined the offer. Or asked "what if I don't want the tablet?". Buyers remorse doesn't mean the rep who told the customer exactly how much the bill is was wrong. 

My grandparents were adults and know how a monthly bill works. If they agreed to a bill and were happy with the price then why would I feel bad about it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Customer care doesn't trump anything. What they love to do is promise the customer a credit and then tell the customer to go to the store to get the credit. At that point the store has their hands tied. Of course customer care can credit things themselves but why do that when they can force another channel to credit.  </TEXT>
