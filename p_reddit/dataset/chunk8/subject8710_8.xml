	<TEXT> I often defend Manchester City because people hate new money like you guys   Chelsea but Stones cost 50M, man. Not dollars or euros, pounds. Manchester City should not under any circumstances be conceding 6 goals. 

Barzagli cost Juventus 300k for reference. Stones will never reach Barzagli's level. </TEXT>

As someone that's been following for over a decade, I can tell you that Halo 2 changed eSports. Prior to Halo 2 it wasn't really a big thing but once MLG picked it up it was quarter-million contracts, Red Bull sponsorships, etc. </TEXT>

I have question regarding fanbases throughout Germany. Now obviously Bayern is the most supported club by far but how is the fanbase of other clubs throughout the country? What would you say are the most supported clubs? 

Also, since there are so many clubs in the Ruhr, what's the breakdown like in the Ruhr itself? I know Leverkusen   Monchengladbach are small cities but do they have more support than other local clubs like Koln? Do folks from Essen support Schalke? Are Stuttgart   Frankfurt heavily supported since their cities are so large? And what's it like in East Germany? Is Leipzig heavily supported nowadays? </TEXT>

I think we should pay 100M for Verratti and then 50M on Manolas. Roma will not reject 50M. Verratti   Manolas would give us a solid core to build on for many years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As an American, I don't get why people can't understand my love for Manchester United. I have supported Manchester United all my life and I'm entering 12th grade in Fall at my high school in Boston, Massachusetts. Manchester United symbolize football to me. Through their tradition, their history, the city of Manchester, the greatest British man of all-time Sir Alex Ferguson, and icons like David Beckham, Manchester United has drawn me and it is the club of my heart. I am finally booking my tickets to go to Manchester in November. Hopefully I can get tickets to visit Old Trafford which is in my opinion the cathedral of football. Although I was born in 1999, I can recall the class of '92 and how magical Beckham, Giggs, Neville and Scholes were on the pitch.

I can't stand these new plastic Manchester City fans though. </TEXT>
