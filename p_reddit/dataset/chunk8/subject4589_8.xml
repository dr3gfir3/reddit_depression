	<TEXT> Alcohol is not only socially acceptable, its strongly interwoven with our history and culture. I don't think it's right to compare a substance that really helps groups of people alleviate social awkwardness in controllable dosages with other drugs. The study you cited is based on data almost 100 years old and in America; its not indicative of much and I think banning something is completely different to legalising something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we have to ask the question why would someone take  drugs?

The answer I think has to do with escaping reality - either the reality of their depressing lives or the reality of a repressive society. In either case, its a quick substitute, not an answer to their problems. 

Will education help them? I think most people are pretty educated about the fact that drugs are bad. I think part of the urge to use comes from a desire to subvert a society that constantly tells us to keep our minds and bodies healthy. Education in this way isn't going to help unless scare tactics are used, which could easily be proven wrong through google etc. Non-legality is the only moral arbiter we have in a post-religious society, it functions so people know either "I'm wrong for taking this substance" or "society is wrong to make it illegal". When you make drugs legal, you take away their right to choose whether to do something bad or not, thus defeating the entire point of drugs in the first place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not necessarily opposed to the idea of medical marijuana, I just think the idea of legalising all drugs is a lazy way for middle-class druggies to legitimise their 'lifestyle' to frame society as the problem while opening the door to corporate colonisation of our perception of reality itself.

	<TEXT> Ok so you're assuming:
 
1) That the money would be spent on the NHS.

2) Legalising drugs won't increase drug use. Right now it's pretty hard to get heroin etc if you don't already travel in circles where drug use is common. Make drugs publicly available and I'm sure we'll have plenty more of irresponsible idiots who taking too much and getting sent to hospital. 

3) There won't be a black market. If the government are going to put a tax drugs, why would users stop going to their cheaper old dealers?

	<TEXT>  The sorts of people that will take drugs in excess following legalisation are either already binge drinking or already taking the same drugs illegally

Yes well isn't it worse that people who have been already been made vulnerable by substances will be hurt even more? Often these people come from already marginal groups homeless/trans/poor/mentally ill/ethnic minorities etc

 If anything people might move from alcohol to less harmful drugs and reduce the NHS strain

Which drugs would these be? 

Regardless, if legalised drugs are taxed properly then drug users can effectively pay for their own treatment.

Is that how it works? How much tax revenue comes would come from an individual meth user vs the cost of surgery, therapy etc? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we're talking about a really marginal amount of money in the grand scheme of things. I don't think it should be reduced to an economic imperative either; the whole debate about drugs is about our collective understanding of reality and our 'rights' to deliberately alter what we perceive to be reality. This is a fundamental issue given the fact that perceptions and reality seems to be moving so quickly these days. It's a conversation we should be having but not on financial terms. </TEXT>

The news seems distant, closed off, concerned about the lives of high profile busy bodies. Yes its based on facts, but a certain consellation of facts that do not speak to the concerns of lots of people. Add to that the idea of a unitary source of news in a world where everyone is living in their own reality and it just becomes hard to believe what's presented as being *the* single source of truth. </TEXT>

Yet doesn't the issue (at least in part) concern the fact that subjectivity itself is the mode of capitalist social reproduction on the internet? When the space for maneuver is so small - when every click is commodified - trolling and shitposting delegitimize networks of power by excluding possibilities for authentic forms of subjectivity.  </TEXT>

The only realistic way for change is going to come is if you stop thinking about what you want to achieve with resistance and start thinking about what it makes you become. Occupy is a case in point here--it may not have been pro- anything but it surely changed the terms of debate in America. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look mate this is actually the subject of my MA thesis. Looking at your post history, most leftists wouldn't give you the time of day let alone an explanation into something that cuts across personal lines like this but I'll try and hash it out for you again anyway. 

Germany was the quintessential modern state. In the same way that Henry Ford used the production line to make cars, Himmler used the production line as an instrument of murder. *Gasenwagens*, mobile killing units involved widespread cooperation from industrialists, town planners, workers, all members of society. 

This is just one example of the innumerable horrors of holocaust to show hegemonic western capitalism that moral/social progress does not follow scientific progress in what was supposedly one of the most advanced countries in the world deemed to be beyond this. This was attested to at Nuremburg and has become the basis of international order, philosophy and art since the WWII. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The historical particulars of the Event itself are irrelevant. We agree here that modernity is not antithetical to barbarism as pre-holocaust thinkers Marx, Freud, Hegel etc supposed. Modernity, instrumental reason convert physical violence into structural violence through bureaucracy, medicalisation and whatnot. This is the truth, *the Real* of our society and its important that we're cognisant of it if we are to maintain our humanity and not descend into totalitarianism. 

The Holocaust acted as what Lacan would call *le point du capiton*, it came to symbolically manifest the rupture of this violence in the public conscience. Yes, under communism we will be able to realise the incontingency of these events and ascribe no deeper meaning to material events like this. But as it stands, the Holocaust is one of the only incontrovertible reminders of horrors we can unleash upon ourselves in a way the Armenian Genocide or Soviet Internments cannot. Spencer wants to delegitimise the primacy of the Holocaust in the pubic mind because he has at least some sympathy with the Nazis. For this reason, we should save Holocaust memory from people like him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The consensus today seems to be that imperialism, was this original sin of modernity. Yet for the West, the Holocaust has come to be understood as the tipping point, the Badiouian Event, the moment where the abyss began to stare back. 

Regardless, the Holocaust has taken the symbolic role of demonstrating a fundamental truth. It's important that we accept this because if we argue whether the Holocaust was indeed this tipping point what we're actually doing is masking the truth of modernity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that while he identities this false particular, he fails to acknowledge the true significance of the holocaust. That is to say that the Holocaust represented the eclipse of modernity as Adorno, Agamben, Ardent etc have shown. It showed us that technological progress does not go hand in hand with moral progress. It showed us that we are imperfect, we are not gods, we need moral limits. Spencer totally misses the point when he says "because Hitler, everything is forbidden".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You might be right but I assume Uber drivers could form their own union as well. I honestly haven't thought about it.

I would be extremely interested in this. Under normal circumstances, an employer would provide the capital (cars) and workers would provide labor (car driving) but in this instance the only capital that Uber provides is a web platform that's costs very little to maintain. I'd like to city cities like New York legislate to kick out these types of private services and run their own version of Uber instead. Profits would go to the city itself and data could be used to improve the running of running of public services. Paul Mason talks about this in his book [Post Capitalism](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/PostCapitalism-Guide-Future-Paul-Mason/1846147387). 

 The Taxi Unions tell their drivers to strike and then they have to strike. If Taxi drivers don't strike, they get pressured by the union and potentially kicked out. It's not a free choice of individuals. 

Yeah but they can still continue to work for Taxi companies.  </TEXT>

No I want to destroy Uber, as you said their entire business model prevents workers from standing up for their interests. They are effectively modern day purveyors of slave labor. 


 The Taxi Unions didn't say lets do this out of "love, feels, etc", they did it because the president's policy is a threat to their organisation / workers.

Not all taxi drivers are immigrants yet they collectively decided to take a stand against Trump, so you can't just go on about rational choice theory. The entire ethos of the union movement is love "an injury to one is an injury to all".  </TEXT>
