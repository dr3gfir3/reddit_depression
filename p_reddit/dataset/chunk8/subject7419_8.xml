And even if they had, this couldnt be a picture of that event: Poe died in 1849, and the single extant photograph of Abraham Lincoln taken prior to Poes passing is a Daguerreotype from 1846 showing Lincoln posing alone.](http://www.snopes.com/lincoln-meets-poe/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh wow. I hadn't heard about Chuck Barris dying. I loved the Newlywed Game and Gong Show. I watched The Dating Game too, but it was not one of my favorites.

Yeah even fictitious interracial couples in the 60s and 70s were controversial. Like [the 1968 kiss on Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_and_Uhura%27s_kiss) and [Tom and Helen Willis on The Jeffersons in 1975.](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/jeffersons-premiere-cbs-1975-article-1.2066272) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the right side you can see [the El Supremo Cafe.](http://i.imgur.com/Kx789Qf.png) I found a Supremo Cafe in the 1965 Los Angeles Street Directory located [at 10354 Wilmington Ave.](http://i.imgur.com/h5UzXzB.png) which is located just south of E 103rd Pl. On the left side the street sign looks like [it might say 103rd Pl.](http://i.imgur.com/1FKjUOy.png) You can see signs for [Mobil, Texaco and Shell services stations.](http://i.imgur.com/1w2S6Xy.png) On [this 1963 aerial view](http://i.imgur.com/wCe1ZED.png) it looks like there could be service stations on the southwest, northwest and southeast corners of Wilmington and E 103rd St. This area as changed a great deal since the posted photo was taken as you can see by [this 2012 aerial view](http://i.imgur.com/Xgewqgc.png) so [the google street view from a similar perspective as the posted photo](https://www.google.com/maps/@33.9419261,-118.2390208,3a,28.4y,356.35h,88.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sDtvNOpcRjIErULaXIYEkwA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1) does not look similar at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is just you. The building in the left foreground is [the Donohoe building](https://calisphere.org/item/772ac657-536f-4d89-96e3-5d0559b98ebb/) which was [destroyed in the 1906 earthquake](http://www.gettyimages.com/license/53224137) and [the Warfield building replaced it in 1922.](https://upfromthedeep.com/2010/12/28/warfield-building/comment-page-1/)

I think the building that you think looks like the Donohoe building is [the Flood building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_Building) which wasn't built until after the old photo was taken. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here is an uncropped higher resolution version of the posted photo.](http://i.imgur.com/rHDTtBb.jpg) In it you can see a promotional poster for the 1957 Oklahoma Semi-Centennial Exposition so this is a publicity photo for the event.

On the right side of the poster is a likeness of and on the top of the boy's helmet is a replica of the [Arrows to Atoms Tower.](https://i.imgur.com/Rbc8VPE.jpg) The actual tower can be partially seen behind the boys helmet in the posted photo.

The tower was built at the Oklahoma State Fair Park in 1957. [A decade later it was declared to be a safety hazard](http://newsok.com/article/3494418) and replaced by [the Arrows to Atoms Space Tower.](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.4748432,-97.5727652,3a,75y,129.94h,103.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sKpIHBq7reopN5h-tobok8Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1)

[Here is a contemporary video about the Oklahoma Semi-Centennial Exposition.](https://youtu.be/hNWJiFcqVco)
