	<TEXT> Your argument about the possibility of death being a good thing  is very interesting and I certainly agree that life without hardship or conflict would be incredibly dull.  And yes I think it is wrong to claim to know God's qualities considering there is very little knowledge or evidence regarding one existing or not existing. Personally what I think is most likely, if there is a God, is that God is indifferent towards the human race with regards to suffering, death and so on. What I said wasn't claiming that God does exist or that he is any of the qualities listed. </TEXT>
