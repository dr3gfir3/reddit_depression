 Papa did not realize musician was more the just small town local dude. found out two months into fall my dad was regularly golfing with an apparently SUPER CHILL DAVE MATTHEWS. we never explained to my dad because we didn't want to ruin his weird golf/lunch dates friendship. .-. I think that's probably why they golfed together that one season, Dave probably enjoyed being treated like a normal dude.

I knew someone who was in Montana and went to be an extra on a shoot who met Kevin Bacon and said he was awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Op could go to therapist and point out fear of driving. Therapist could recommend getting a bigger car. Op buys said bigger car and does feel better. Op has shown emotional distress that she was treated for with big car. Judge awards emotional treble damages: cost of therapy, all car costs (loss of value in old car + difference in price for new car), and pain and suffering.

No, he got fired or not. But it doesn't sound like Federal DOT became involved. But if they did become involved it would have been way worse for the driver of the truck. So, the whole part of whether the person responsible in this instance is whether the "damage" whether political or in reality is rising to the level of notice for the Federal DOT. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  best excuse that could be summed up like this: "I didn't see her car as I was pulling up to the light. I was giving enough distance to stop to the car in front of her but I didn't see her. I didn't hear the horn blaring because I was in a diesel vehicle and didn't realize that I'd hit her or that I was even involved in an accident and that's why I didn't stop. I'd been having break issues and thought it was just my brakes acting up."

How can you edit your mistake and miss the same mistake?  How can a driver stop in front of you at the light? This whole story is weird. edit: I'd been havening break issues with HR so I stopped for 15 seconds? </TEXT>

edit: I mean that after you ask if you're being detained a few time it's reasonable to assume that you aren't. So you drive off or walk away and get your head smashed and world fucked up, maybe but you're on solid legal ground. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I think somewhere in the 30-40 lb range for potatoes and corn. I'm thinking they should be equal. Probably better to have too much than not enough, there won't be anyone sober enough to go get more, and the cook can always not add it all.  Regarding sausage, you want a lot. Maybe 60 lbs? The trick is to have enough spice for all of that, but I guess someone else is responsible for that part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ate at a place that served crap Mexican on the UNM campus in ABQ the other day. That place has 5 stars on google and has expanded to take over the whole block. Parking is insane. Man, it was really good though. My regular Mexican place offers the rellenos 3 ways, and I they have really good salsa. I like to make stuff at home also, like a pork green chile stew. That's pretty awesome. I guess that Mexico has lots of styles because it's fairly large and you've got to find the ones you like, or find something you like that is in the style of the restaurant that you feel comfortable with. There's a new restaurant near me that is completely different from the others. I won't say it's better/worse, just different style. Also, I think Mexico City is doing a lot of new things which cost a lot and are taking Mexican food to new territory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you know how in Purgatory I am about this post?  Well, it's really put me in a Quandry. Can I upvote or not?  Seriously, breaded wings, and you try to pass that off as fried chicken? Well I guess that's accurate. I won't upvote any post that doesn't have a picture inline, and here you are OP with the picture right there so I don't have to go to some other website. But your wings look crunchy, and not completely sauced. Or maybe it's soaked into that beautiful breading. But wings shouldn't have breading.
