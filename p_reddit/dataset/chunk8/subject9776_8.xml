	<TEXT> Nope. I have a good memory of both games and also access to sophisticated scientific instruments such as google search, which allows me to look up soundtrack lists for NFSU2 and not a single one of them shows Get Low on them.

You might've had a somehow modded version, I don't say it's impossible.

EDIT: Okay, upon applying more science I did find trace information of Get Low being present in NFSU2 but hardly anything is explained how and where. </TEXT>

It used to be a fearsome thing, these 12.7 russian gunners could shred pretty much anything behind it, especially if it was japanese. Nowadays with nerfed durability of larger aircraft it's mostly outgunned. And the crap bombload was always a major issue. This is a welcome change, might wanna dust it off at some point...
