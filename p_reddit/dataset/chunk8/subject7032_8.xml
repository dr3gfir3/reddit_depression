	<TEXT> College is the time for experimentation. And no, I don't mean titrating sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid in chemistry. I mean forcing yourself to try new things - things that excite you - things that *scare* you - for how else are we supposed to discover who we are and what we're capable of without constantly pushing the boundaries of our reality? 

At least, that's the excuse my boyfriend Mike came up with when he suggested a threesome. 

"Sure," I replied. 

"Really? Wow, okay. You're the coolest girlfriend ever -" 

"What's the other guy's name?" 

I knew what he meant, but I still enjoyed watching him choke on the soda he was drinking. Mike had been talking a lot about Amy since she joined our lab group in anatomy. I was jealous at first, but after checking out the competition, I had to concede his point. It was hard *not* watching the supple curves of her body everyday as she stripped her sweater over her head to put her lab coat on. I guess I was just relieved Mike was talking to me about it instead of doing something with her behind my back. 

He wanted me to broach the subject with her because "it sounded less creepy coming from a girl", so I invited her to join Mike and I for drinks after class. 

"Have you ever done anything with a girl before?" I asked Amy after our third beer. Mike spluttered in his drink and excused himself to go to the bathroom, and I almost threw the rest of my glass after him. This was his idea. It wasn't fair making me do all the work. Luckily, there wasn't much work that needed doing. 

"Not yet," she replied, a smile playing around the corner of her lips. 

Two hours later, all of us were in my room trying to figure out how one person fits in a dorm-room bed, let alone three. It was exciting for me, and I can only imagine how many flashing lights and alarms were blaring inside Mike's head, so I guess it was understandable that he spent most of the time focused on Amy. Besides, Mike and I were already comfortable with each other, so it was really just her that he felt the need to impress. Afterward he said it wasn't the case, but I still remember spending way too long hanging out and watching them go at it. I even left to use the bathroom at one point without either of them noticing I was gone. 

I didn't want to get mad. I had agreed to this after-all, and I hated the idea of being one of those infamous girlfriends who said one thing and did another. I just wanted to get *even*. It didn't help that he started acting cocky afterward, as though that experience made him a *big man* or something. He even started pointing out particularly geeky looking freshman and saying things like "I bet he's never even been with one, let alone *two*". 

Although asking for another guy started out as a joke, I started pushing for it more seriously. I wanted him to feel what it was like to be jealous. I wanted him to appreciate what I had done for him and realize I was the only one of us who had the power to make it happen again. And yeah, if I'm being honest, maybe I even wanted to humiliate him a little so he'd go back to regular old Mike and drop this macho facade.  

We started having fights about it, and the more he said no, the more one-sided our relationship seemed. I told Amy I thought I was going to have to dump him (she and I still hung out sometimes, although I never invited Mike when we did). I told her it wasn't her fault, but she still felt guilty about getting between us (literally). That's why she came up with a solution: 

"I know a place where they do it in a group. You'll get your kinks out, he'll have someone of his own to have fun with, and everyone is wearing a mask so nobody gets hurt."  

---

*Big rubber animal masks*. Didn't it get hot in there? I felt more than a little exposed wearing my stupid Mardi Gras mask I picked up at the dollar store on the way here. Everyone else's mask was hyper-realistic and covered their entire head, but they told me not to worry about it and just relax. Mike and I were just "initiates" on a trial run anyway. If we decided this was our thing and we respected all of their rules and members, then they'd give us a full mask next time. 

At first I stuck pretty close to Mike, and we just fooled around with each other and watched. There was about a dozen people in total, and the teeming mass of bodies was pretty damn intimidating to approach. Several of them had covered their bodies in some kind of paint or oil, and they churned and writhed against each other with an almost animalistic intensity. Everywhere I looked, breasts were heaving, indiscriminate hands clutched and pulled on skin, and bodies lunged hungrily at one another as though nourished by their carnal lust.  

I was about to call it quits and leave when a man in a panther-mask pulled away from the others to approach me. His body was chiseled and slick with paint. Mike and I exchanged glances. Isn't this what I wanted? I pointed him in the direction of a leopard-mask with fiery red hair spilling out beneath it. He hesitated, so I gave him a little shove. If nothing else, this would be a shared experience we could laugh and bond over, and maybe we'd both be stronger for it. 
 
I still shuddered a bit when the panther-man put his hand on my shoulders from behind, but his probing fingers expertly massaged down my back and I felt myself melt into his touch. 

---

Mike left shortly after that. We'd only been there about a half-hour, and I was really (*really*) starting to enjoy myself when I saw him staring at me and the panther-man. Good, let him see! But then he just turned around and walked away, and my satisfaction quickly drained. I followed him, and we had another fight in the hallway while we were both still naked. He said he couldn't even look at me again after seeing me like that. Somehow the fact that he was more hurt and sensitive than me *proved* that he cared more about me than I did him, so it was over. He got dressed and left, and I just stood there overflowing with frustration.

I felt massaging hands caressing my shoulders again, and I immediately felt the tension flowing out through them. If I was looking for a rebound to get past Mike, then I couldn't think of a more immersive, therapeutic one than this. I allowed the panther-man to lead me back into the room. The lights had dimmed since I was gone, but a lot of the paint people wore was glowing in the dark. More hands grabbed me, and I allowed myself to be swallowed up in the psychedelic dance of skin on skin, swirling colors, and the growing moan which encompassed me. 

As the night went on, the lights continued to slowly dim. The colors grew brighter, and the intensity of the sound and insistence of the sensation mounted into a crescendo of pleasure. I spent most of my time with the panther-man, although I allowed myself to be passed from one person to the next without complaint. There was no embarrassment, no judgement, no jealousy, only the acceptance and triumph of our shared celebration of life.  

I was back with the panther-man now, body flooded with gentle warmth and satisfaction. His hands were so powerful yet gentle, and his low moans resonated with my own as though we were a single being harmonized with itself. The thought of leaving here and never knowing who was - perhaps never even meeting him again - was more agonizing than I could have imagined. I felt an overpowering desire to look at the man pressed against me - just for a second - just long enough to recognize him if we met again. I slid my hands up his neck and tenderly slipped the mask further up his face... 

But it wouldn't come off. I pulled harder, and felt the strain of living fur beneath my fingers. He grunted in pain - or was that a snarl? - and I pushed him off me. Suddenly every sound came to its height and the mounting carnal cacophony enveloping me became tainted with other sounds.  

Were those moans? Or was someone starting to howl? And then a yelping joined in. I thought it was a joke at first, but one by one the people began to bray, bark, hiss, or whatever other sound was appropriate to the mask they wore. The panther-man knelt upon the ground and I saw his muscles coil as though preparing to spring. It was so dark that I could only see the parts of him covered in paint, and from a few steps away he looked more like an abstract painting than a man. 

I ran toward the door, but tripped over a dark form along the way. A multitude of hands clung onto me in the shadows, and then a paw with razor sharp claws tore the skin on my outer thigh. I screamed and pushed onward, but the grips readily released me as though shocked I wasn't appreciating their touch. I made it to the wall, but I couldn't find the door. The panther-man crawled toward me on all fours. Some of the glowing paint was on his skin, but more of it was matted in patches of thick black hair on his body. 

I leaped along the wall looking for the door, ramming against another body and falling to the ground. The half-panther was almost on top of me now, but I couldn't bear to look at him. I closed my eyes and *screamed* for all I was worth. 

"Are you okay? What are you doing?" 

I opened my eyes. The lights were on. Everyone was staring at me. The panther-man with his chiseled *human* body was standing over me. He pulled on his furry ear, and I almost screamed again before seeing the rubber mask slide easily off. He was a handsome man, about thirty, with strong cheek bones and deep concerned eyes. 

I ran out the door and dressed in the hallway. The panther-man started to follow me.

"Stop her! She's seen too much!" he shouted, his voice a harsh guttural snarl completely unlike the one he used a moment before. 

A woman in a sheep's mask held him back. "Let her go. She'll come back when she's ready." The voice sounded familiar. Was that Amy? I didn't stay long enough to find out. As soon as my clothes were even halfway on, I ran. 

---

I'm not going back. I can't go back. But maybe I'll have to, because I still need answers. I missed my period the next month, but I tried not to think back to that night. I was on the pill and they all had protection. Just to be safe, I got a pregnancy test, but it came up negative. 

I kept testing every month after that. Still nothing. But all the symptoms were beginning to show: I'm swelling up, I'm tired all the time, I'm nauseous in the mornings. I got an ultrasound, but the doctor said he didn't see anything. It's just like a great, empty pit is growing inside of me. I got a few other scans, but nothing came up and the doctor just thinks its a hysterical-pregnancy which will pass on its own. 

I didn't know how to tell him I thought it was something else, just like I didn't know how to explain the claw scars on my outer thigh. 

I want to forget it ever happened, but it's hard when I keep feeling something *scratching* me [from the inside](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog).

	<DATE> 2017-04-23 22:08:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm going to tell you a few things about me. When I was a kid, I lost in the finals of a state tennis championship because I told the truth about a line call when I didn't have to. I once climbed a tree to get somebody's cat down, then stayed up there the rest of the night just because it was so peaceful. My favorite food is strawberries and cream, only I don't tell the other guys because they'd give me shit for it. 

I also joined the 18th Street Gang when I was in the sixth grade. It's important what order I tell you these things, because the moment someone notices my blue and black bandanna, they think they already know everything about me. 

I'm a sophomore in high-school now, and last night was my first break-in. "Spike", an old-school Mexican Mafia type, was there to show me the ropes. He taught me how to map out the regular patrol routes of officers, and how to hide in a concrete drain pipe to avoid being seen. 

I'd never stolen anything bigger than a candy bar before. I was scared as Hell, but I knew Spike was tight with everybody and would tell them how I did. This was my first real chance to let everyone decide what I was made of, and I wasn't going to screw it up. 

"Let's not do this one, it has an alarm system." Middle-class suburban home with a white-picket fence - nothing that screamed a good target to me. 

"Doesn't matter when they let you in," Spike said. He grinned. Just because I'm in a gang doesn't mean I understand gold teeth. They're disgusting.  

"But someone's here. There's a light on up there!" I protested. "Let's keep looking." Maybe if we didn't find a good target tonight, we could just go back and play pool and try again another night. I'd be ready another night. 

"How are they gonna open the door if they ain't home? Fuck's sake," he said. Spike walked around the house and turned the garden hose on full blast. He found two more taps along the back of the house and turned those on too. 

He waited a few minutes for a lake to start forming in the yard before ringing the door bell. I wanted to stop him, but I was frozen. My heart beat faster with each light that turned on as the resident approached his front door. 

"Who is it?" someone yelled from inside. 

"Excuse me sir," Spike shouted. "I noticed one of your pipes burst. Just thought you should know." 

The door opened. An old man - at least 80 - stood there in his bathrobe. I never want to get that old where my eyes shrink down to little pin-pricks and my skin hangs in loose folds like that. Spike gave me a grotesque wink. 

"It did? Oh God," the old man said. 

"Yeah, look at all that water," Spike said. "I was just walking on the sidewalk with my kid," he wrapped his arm around my shoulder and fought the urge to pull away from his sticky-sweet odor of dried sweat. 

"Yo," I said.

"We found which one it was, here come take a look," Spike didn't even wait for a reply. I wonder how many times he's done this before. The old man pulled his bathrobe tighter and followed Spike around the side of the house. 

I wanted to warn him. To tell him to run - to hide and lock the door. I couldn't turn my back on my own though. If this was going to happen anyway, I might as well be the one to return with some glory. The moment the old man passed me by, I picked up a rock from his yard and **SMASHED** it straight into his temple. He crumpled to the ground like a bag of dirt.

Gold teeth flashed. "Nice one kid. Now let's drag him inside so we can take our time with the place." 

I propped him up against the wall in the living room. He was still breathing, but there was a lot of blood coming from his head. I thought about bandaging him up, but I didn't know if that would seem like a sign of weakness. I just wanted to get in and get out as fast as I could.

*Snarl. Woof woof woof woof*.

"Shit, there's a dog," Spike grunted. 

The sound was coming from behind a closed door down a few concrete steps - probably leading to the basement. 

"It can't get at us," I said. "Let's ignore it." 

"Nah, too much noise. Quick, go deal with it," he said.

"Deal with it?" I didn't want to hear him explain. He didn't say a word, but that flash of gold and the knife he handed me - that was even worse. 

"Make it quick. You're gonna be a man after tonight." 

I gripped the knife in my hand so hard my knuckles turned white. I turned away from Spike so he wouldn't see me shaking. 

"I'm gonna go check upstairs for a safe or somethin," Spike said. "Or cash under the mattress - these old shits think that's safer than a bank sometimes. That thing better be quiet by the time I get up there." 

I wasn't worried about it being a big dog. An old guy like this probably had a poodle or something, but hurting any animal has always been off-limits for me. Being loyal to my colors over my own instinct - there wasn't any going back from this. I hated myself for opening the door.

I was tense and ready for it to spring at me. I even slashed the air with the knife a couple of times until I found the light switch. I didn't see anything but a set of stairs though, so I walked down to find the miserable creature. 

*Snarl. Woof woof woof woof.*

"Why is it still barking?" I heard from upstairs. 

"I don't know," I shouted back. 

I was staring face to face with a grown man, probably around fifty years old, stripped down to his underwear and shackled to the wall with iron clasps around his wrists and ankles. His facial hair was thick and greasy, and it was matted in with the long unkempt black hair spilling from his head. 

*Snarl. Woof woof.* 

The man barked at me like an animal. He pulled against the metal restraints as he tried to dive at me, snapping his jaw and frothing into his beard. Then there was a flash of recognition in his eye and he pressed himself back against the wall. His mouth contorted awkwardly, almost as though he was trying to say something. 

"Don't make me come down there and do it for you," Spike said. His voice was closer now, like he was coming back downstairs.  

I dropped the knife and ran. I don't know what the Hell was going on, I didn't care what was going to happen to me, I could not be in that room. Spike was waiting for me outside the basement. 

"What's going on? Did you do it?" 

I just kept running. Straight out the door. I ran the whole 3 miles back to my house without even stopping. Spike followed me out - I don't think he ever saw the thing. He must have told the other guys, because I got a 18 second beating for what happened. I took it like a man. I didn't even make a sound. 

I didn't tell anyone what I saw, or what I heard the thing say as I was leaving. 

*"Kill... me..."*

---

Spike was waiting for me when I got off the school-bus today. He wrapped his arm around my shoulders and led me away from the other kids. I flinched when he touched me. 

"Last night..." he said.

"I'm sorry. I messed up. It's my fault," I replied. I'd already taken the beating. What more could happen?

"I get it, first time is scary. But facing that fear, that's what makes a man out of you," he said. "I checked up on the house, and there wasn't any police report or anything. The old guy was dead, but nobody's found him yet." 

"Did you look in the basement?" I asked. 

"Nah, I didn't stay, but the two of us are going back tonight. We're gonna finish the job." 

How could I tell him? It would just sound like a lame-ass excuse. He'd just think I was scared, and I'd get beaten again. I just nodded. There wasn't any way out of this for me. I've already killed a man, so what's so much worse about [killing an animal](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

The book was *breathing*. That was the first thing I noticed when I entered the back room of the National Library of Sweden. 

I hadn't expected Dr. Beckel to call me until the morning, but my restless slumber was disturbed in the dead of night by a phone call. 

"Hello? Hello? Everything okay?" I asked. What respectable person would call after midnight except in an emergency? 

"Yes indeed. Come join me, will you?" 

"Who is this? What time is it?" I asked. 

"It's Dr. Beckel, and it's imperative you come at once." 

The line went dead. I squinted against the harsh light from my screen. **1 AM**. A text message flashed the library's address. Then another containing a mapped route. I set my phone down, but it kept beeping and flashing. 

*Pass-codes to enter the building.* 

*Floor directory inside the building.* 

*Combination of the backroom vault where the book was.* 

I tried calling him again, but it just went to voicemail. He had evidently planned this out quite extensively. A looming dread hung about me while I stumbled about the room getting dressed. What emergency could possibly arise from a book? Unless of course the legends were true... 

By the time I arrived at the library, I had fully convinced myself against the absurd idea. I didn't see any security on the way in, so I figured Dr. Beckel had dismissed them for the evening and invited me now so I wouldn't be seen. Perhaps it was against their regulations to allow an outsider into the vault, and he was simply extending a courtesy to me for discovering the artifact. 

Of course, we had enigmatically parted with him saying "to greet him with me", but even that could be an awkward translation for 'seeing the book'. Dr. Beckel was kind enough to speak in English for my benefit, so I couldn't hold an odd turn-of-phrase against him. 

I knew the book was inside even as I approached the door. The air was somehow tangible as though resisting my advance, and a compulsion set about me to run without cause. I typed the vault combination into the keypad and opened the door, and I was shocked to find my fingers stiff as though frostbitten by cold.  

Dr. Beckel was standing over a steel table with the massive tome opened before him. I didn't get a true sense of the thing's scale from a page, but weighing in at 165 pounds, measuring almost 3x2 feet across, and stitched with the skin from over 150 different donkeys, the Codex Gigas was truly the most magnificent book I have ever encountered. 

Oh, and it was *breathing*. The pages fluttered softly up and down in the dead air, and I could feel my own breath and heart automatically resonate and match the even pulses. The sensation of a nameless terror was even stronger up close, almost as though I just remembered I was being chased while not being able to recall who or what was pursuing me. 

"It's beautiful - isn't it?" Dr. Beckel asked, not taking his eyes off the book. His words came in short, halting bursts as they too matched the pulsing rhythm. "It thanks - you for the - missing page." 

"What is - going on?" I tried to force myself to take a deep breath, but it caught in my throat and expelled involuntarily in time with the rhythm. 

Dr. Beckel closed the Codex and the intensity of its presence immediately lessened. He turned towards me with a maniacal gleam in his eye almost as terrifying as the book. 

"Do you know what is so fascinating about Herman the Recluse?" His words slurred over one another in their haste, and I didn't have the chance to respond. "Not the desperate plight he found himself in - not that he wrote this - not even that his soul is still bound within its pages. What is *truly* remarkable about Herman, is that when he called out in the blackest night of his need, he found a voice who answered." 

"But how do you know about his soul? What has it - has *he* told you?" 

"He told me he wants out - that he is ready to make a deal again," Dr. Beckel said, tenderly running his hands down the book's spine. "Only he has nothing left to offer the Devil, so he has made a deal with me instead."

"I don't understand what any of this has to do with me," I replied. If he was just trying to show off, then I've seen enough. 

"But it has everything to do with you!" Dr. Beckel practically shrieked. "I need Herman to tell me how he struck a deal with Lucifer, and Herman needs a body to bind his soul and escape the book. Naturally I couldn't offer my own, but you, my dear dear fellow, have a perfect vessel for his use." 

Beckel opened the book again now, and my heart ached as it strained to race in conflict with the encompassing rhythm. The words *burned* upon the page as though written in fire, and though I urged my body to retreat toward the door, I found my feet jolting inexorably forward with each gasping breath. 

I struggled helplessly as Dr. Beckel whipped a butterfly knife from his pocket. I tried to lurch out of his reach, but only fell sprawling on my back as my feet continued relentlessly plodding toward the book. I needn't have worried though, because Dr. Beckel hadn't intended to use the knife on me. 

I watched from the ground as he drew the blade across his own palm, spilling his blood freely over my reclaimed page. The thick drops *sizzled* on the paper like water does on a hot pan, and a cloud of bloody must pervaded the air.  

"The deal is struck," Dr. Beckel grunted through the pain. "Take your prize, and then deliver mine."  

The odor from the red mist stung my eyes and blurred my mind. The sound of his voice was like an avalanche, and the intolerable *pulse* from the heaving book dominated my thoughts until my entire world existed in each beat; each pause between was a vacuous nightmare of suspense and anticipation. 

I didn't exactly *see* what happened after that, but I could sense it as though imagining a scene from a book. I felt my body - what used to be my body anyway - standing up from the floor to stagger across the room. I felt Dr. Beckel embrace him and help him stand.

"Take your time, Herman," Dr. Beckel said. "It's been 900 years since you last walked, you might have forgotten a thing or two." 

"Is that long?" I heard my own voice reply. "That is no greater span than an hour in Hell, just as infinite suffering cannot be halved. Eternity then has come and gone, and my pact with Lucifer is at last resolved." 

Dr. Beckel opened the door. I tried to shout - to move - but I had no body left to fight against my prison. 

"Eternity is nothing to me if it means I can wield the Devil's hand. You will show me the rite you called him by?" 

"If I have learned anything from my ordeal," Herman said from my body, "it is the power of one's word. I shall give unto you what is promised, but we must first gather some ingredients for the ritual." 

I have never felt such abject anguish as watching my body leave me. I could not *feel* pain as I did when I was alive, no receptors or frayed nerves registered my dire situation, but I was overcome with a spiritual torment which crushed my every perception. In that moment, every good memory of my life was tainted: every smile was twisted, every affection insincere, and every triumph or pride I ever possessed was altered to feature my shame and self-loathing. I felt as though I must have lived the most despicable life in the history of man, but even knowing it was over brought me no relief because I knew I must spend eternity now recalling and obsessing over my misery. I felt I must be destined to wait until unknown eons brought the human race crumbling into death around me, and still I would be bound to sit alone and dwell upon my grief. 

I don't know how much time passed in such a miserable state, but I blessed the disruption of the opening door as though it were an Angel come to rescue me. The bespectacled man from the book fair, now carrying a large backpack, crept into the room to regard me. He walked effortlessly up to the steel table as though unaffected by the book's preternatural presence to close my cover. Instantly I felt some degree of sanity and stability return, and I held onto my conscious spark for all I was worth. 

**Can you hear me?** I screamed in my mind. **Herman has stolen my body! I'm trapped in here!**

"Henry. Henry Iggins," he replied. Presumably his name, Henry withdrew an identical Codex Gigas from his backpack and laid it upon the table. He then picked me up and secured me in the pack. 

**What?**

 "Yes yes, I can hear you. Now where did they go?" 

**To gather ingredients for a rite to summon Lucifer, but I don't know what-**

"Not to worry, I'll handle it from here. Come now, we're going to get your body back.** 

**Why are you helping me?**

"Because Dr. Beckel stole something from me," his narrowed eyes flashed dangerously behind his spectacles, "and that was a very foolish thing to do."

Henry Iggins moved with the vitality of a much younger man. I could sense my surroundings around the backpack and felt him carry me to one obscure shop after another. I couldn't quite make out where these places were, but none of them had any signs or banners to distinguish their unusual wares: the hand of a nun, skeletal fragments from dead kings, and a cat which had been skinned and turned inside out, to name just a few. 

Henry conversed rapidly with each shop owner in an unfamiliar tongue before moving onto the next. After three or four such shops, he seemed to receive an answer which satisfied him, prompting us to take a cab out of town. 

**What are you going to do when you find him?** 

"That depends how quick we are. If he has already finished the ritual, then it will be up to him to decide what will happen next."

**Do you have any idea why he wants to make a pact with Lucifer?** 

"Not precisely, but I am familiar with his type. No doubt some short-sighted, selfish goal that will not bring him half the satisfaction he is anticipating." 

**But you weren't going to use the book for the same thing, were you?** 

"Do I look like a fool? Perhaps I do, but that is a fault of my years and not my sensibilities. No, I simply want to make him pay. *No-one* steals from me."

My ordinary senses might be clouded, but I could feel the the ritual in progress like a black-lighthouse drawing me through the woods. Henry trusted my directions as I navigated through the dense pine trees which huddled so close together as to block out the sky. As I drew near, I could feel the rhythm of my own *pulse* harmonize with the presence. My conscious thoughts were devoured by the beat, and I must have lost consciousness for a moment because suddenly I was in a clearing of trees inside a large circle of salt upon the ground. 

"Who are you? What are you doing here?" Dr. Beckel asked. He was standing with Herman who knelt with a bloody butcher's knife. Rolls of yellowed parchment lay as bedding for a headless goat which stained the paper deep scarlet. 

"I hope I didn't interrupt anything," Henry Iggins said. 

"That man from the book fair -" Dr. Beckel choked in disbelief. "And what have you got there?"

"It does not matter," Herman said. "The ritual is complete. Lucifer arrives." 

I strained to feel if anything had changed. The presence which drew me here had lifted. The pulsing was all but gone. Dr. Beckel glanced anxiously around him, while Herman remained kneeling with his head bowed in silent reverence.

"You tricked me," Dr. Beckel snarled. "Where is he? Why don't I see him?" 

"*He is already here,* Herman replied. 

Henry Iggins shrugged and put down the backpack. "Satan sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto. Game is up, boys. But you didn't need all that mumbo jumbo to bring me here. If you want my attention, all you have to do is steal from me."

He didn't feel any different, but there was something about the tone of Henry's voice which left no doubt in my mind. The words carried a certain *weight* as though gravity itself would stop to listen to what he said. I had spent the afternoon with the Devil without even realizing it. 
 
"Herman and I had a deal," Henry continued, and I know the same presence must be weighing on the others for they let him speak without interruption. "His soul was mine from the moment I bound it within the Codex Gigas, and by setting him free you have stolen him from me. I DO NOT LIKE. BEING STOLEN FROM." The last words bellowed from all directions like the forest itself was screaming. 

Dr. Beckel fell to his knees from the impact of that voice, but he immediately reclaimed his footing.

"Take him back, I don't care," Beckel said. "You and I have a deal though, don't we? I called and you answered. You shall serve me if you want my soul too." 

"First things first," Henry said. He snapped his fingers and I coughed blood. Both events happened simultaneously. One instant I was inside the book, the next I was kneeling in the circle beside Dr. Beckel. *Back in my own body.* 

"Enough!" Dr. Beckel screamed. "Now for my wish, Lucifer. I want you to let all the sinners out of Hell and bring them here to Earth. I want your army of the damned to obey my orders and serve me until my dying breath. Until the day you return to claim my soul, I do not want to see you again." 

Henry laughed - long peels of sardonic laughter which reverberated down into my bones. A cold wind whistled through the trees, making the whole forest seem to be laughing alongside him. Dr. Beckel gripped the knife tighter in his hand, looking as though he were about to *lunge* at Henry. "The rite is complete. We have a deal, Lucifer!" 

"Don't worry, the damned will be here soon enough," Henry said. "They will rise with the coming of **The Beast**. But Herman never made a deal with Lucifer - there is no Lucifer. When he called out in the night, it was *I* who answered, and I do not serve man."

"What are you?" Dr. Beckel dropped once more to his knees. "How are you even in this world if it was not from my summons?" 

"*The Second Demon Seed* has grown ripe within me," Henry said, "and so I have returned. Five more to go before **The Beast** arrives." 

Dr. Beckel growled in exasperation and leaped at Henry. The bespectacled man waved his hand and a searing flame engulfed the librarian. I watched transfixed as Beckel's skin melted off like running water, revealing bones splitting from the heat and clouds of evaporating blood and marrow which filled the air. Henry turned his gaze toward me where I still knelt in the circle. He grinned sheepishly like a school-boy who was caught misbehaving. 

"Thank you for your help. I have already replaced the Codex with a fake, so you may keep the real one for your trouble."

"You aren't going to hurt me?" I asked. I had so many more questions, but that was all I could force out of my dry mouth. 

"Of course not. I still need you," he said. "I need you to spread the fear of what is fated until mankind screams with one voice, so that together we may welcome his rise."

I still have the Codex Gigas, although I can't imagine how I will smuggle it out of the country when I'm returning to the States next week. After knowing what it is like, I feel terrible for Herman now trapped inside once more. I considered burning the cursed tome, but somehow the weight of its presence and its connection with that Demon makes me believe it still has a role to play. Perhaps I will simply hide it until the the time of **The Beast** [has begun](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/674eel/breaking_and_entering_hell/).
