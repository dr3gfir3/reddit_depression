	<TITLE> Why Retailers are Stagnant </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After the Winter Season sales, the numbers were disappointing. They announced of closing stagnant stores.

The big reason they are stagnant or at risk of bankrupt is that people are shopping online. People can find better deals there with some websites offer free, fast shipping. The online is much more accessible that to drive to a store and hassle through parking.

Every semester, I have to purchase textbooks. I usually purchase through codes from the professors, as they are much more affordable that purchasing from private sellers.

We will see malls failing and e-commerence becoming rampant. The malls will likely turn into residential, commercial, or offices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ever since the 2016 election, we have seen America becoming more polarized. It has been so polarized that California is renewing calls for secession.

Currently, the Republicans are becoming more radical. We see that the GOP are becoming more hard line. We are seeing that the party wants to gut social programs to fund themselves, the military, and the corporates. This will hurt the common people.

Democrats, however, are becoming more social. Blue states are becoming more and more generous. They all announced to continue the social programs the congress are killing. They are willing to help immigrants from the ICE. There is a Twitter handle #bluexit in supporting of blue seceding from the Union.

Whenever I take the 7 train to get home from Baruch College, I saw a abandoned factory scheduled to be demolished with graffiti saying "free Edward Snowden" and anti-NSA rhetoric. After the factory got demolished, on the wall bordering the foundation, I saw graffiti of anti-Trump rhetoric. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Multiple Units vs. Locomotives </TITLE>

	<TEXT> There are two types of trains: multiple units and locomotives. Each type of train have different configurations.

Multiple units are several powered trains grouping together to form one train set. This is common on most commuter rail, most regional, all subway, and most high-speed railway services. Such trains have better traction, shorter shunting times, and better acceleration.

Locomotives are power trains that are used to pull unpowered carriages. This is common in heritage railways, some commuter railways, some high-speed railways, freight and some regional railways. They have the ease of replacing the locomotive, safety, and maximum usage of power cars. They are usually work trains used for repair or maintenance work. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Owlman the Hitman </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-05 17:58:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the suburb of Musashi-Ono() between Tokyo and Chiba, there is an half owl-half human 18-year-old named Muneo Yoshikawa(). He recently graduated from high school, but became a freelancer after dropping out of college. He works as a singer-songwriter, game designer, animator, and gamer. One day, he met a monk at a Buddhist temple and receives the power to become a superhero. Thus, Hooman() has been born.

Hooman, however, is an antihero. He believes that evildoers and perpetuators of injustice should be punished with death. He prefers to use a katana to do the dirty job. At times, he is called in to assist executions and get paid to kill people he is ordered to. Every time he kills a person, he uses his victim's blood to create his insignia as a sign that he was there. Due to this ruthless tactic, people call him Hooman the Killer().

During his gaming career, he became friends with a 16-year-old raccoon named Tsunehito Azuma(), who resides in Kawachi-Ota(), a 17-year-old pig named Jin Akai(), who resides in Harima-Tonda() a 19-year-old monkey named Takuya Mutsu(), who resides in Mikawa-Omachi(), and a 20-year-old sparrow named Daisuke Omi(), who resides in Chikuzen-Yamada(). They later became informers to Hooman.

To avoid suspicion, he sends and receives encrypted messages through an app. He receives cash payments in person or use an app to receive money anonymously.

Muneo dislikes corruption, black markets, fraud, and scams. He likes child fornication with condoms, prostitution, gambling, porn, especially shotacons and lolicons, erotic arts, and apologetic murders. He always supports progressive socialist democratic politics. In one scenario, he killed a yakuza boss with cyanide. He is a fan of the 36-year-old populist Socialist democratic dog politician Tsuyoshi Imai(), who was mayor of his suburb. In a bid to be prime minister, the hard-line conservative ideologogue polar bear rival Jiro Kurokawa() won second place.

Hooman became Imai's part-time bodyguard. Whenever Hooman is with Tsuyoshi, he is always seen carrying his katana, wakizashi, and a thick, 100 centimeter-long, detachable kiseru smoking pipe that can turn into a mini machine gun.

Muneo created Min'natube to counteract Everytube's restrictions. The website's terms of service is much more lax and instead of using algorithms, he uses a group of admins to review videos before getting automatically monitarized. Ad revenue started pouring in after corporates appreciate the policies.

Muneo believes that to obtain complete control of the government, the prime minister should bug every dissident. The prime minister, however, is a libertarian. He approves of rising taxes to benefit the people.

After Imai won, Kurokawa arrives at Muneo's house and attempt to kill him in retaliation, but got killed and Muneo painted Hooman's insignia with Kurokawa's blood, and presented Imai Kurokawa's head in order to become his minion. This has caused the rise of identify politics and polarization.

Hooman believes that effective population control can only happen by committing mass murders. This is why the superhero enjoys spree killings with any weapon he uses.

The prime minister used some funding to build the Museum of Heads to document each person Hooman kills. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Using Condiments </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-05 02:17:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Whenever I eat food, I use condiments sparsely, except for fried food and sushi. I believe that condiments mask the food's original taste when it is cooked.

Whenever I order food in restaurants, the food itself is already cooked in sauce. Adding sauce will masks it's original taste. In some buffets, you have to grab a plate and put what you want to eat on one plate. This is typical to see sauces getting mixed up, except for sushi buffets and yakiniku restaurants. In these restaurants, each item is served in individual plates. In Gyukaku, a chain yakiniku restaurant, all lunch items are served on one plate. You have sauces at your table to dip with. I omit them as the food itself is already flavored. Whenever I order al la carte, I always order the cuts of meat with sauce.

When I eat hotpot, these restaurants will always have a hot pot bar to mix my sauce. I always mix shacha BBQ sauce, peanut sauce, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame oil, sesame sauce, oyster sauce, lemon or ponzu if eating shabu shabu, wasabi if available, cilantro, and welsh onions. I always mix the concoction up and end up with a bowl of red sauce with a combination of everything. I use it to cool down the items I put into the pot.

When I eat sushi, you have wasabi, soy sauce, and ginger, on the table. I only use them on tempura and any sushi pieces, except on gunkan-maki, eel, and some aburi sushi. These pieces are already have sauce on them, so I don't have to dip in soy sauce, but I will use wasabi.

I have eaten zaru soba, which is buckwheat noodles washed in running water before soaking on ice water. This dish is always served with noodle sauce, which is soy sauce boiled with dash bonito stock, sake, and mirin. The noodles itself is tasteless, which is dipped in the sauce before being slurped. The sauce can be drinker by pouring soba water into it.

Fried food, like fries and tortilias chips, are tasteless. These have condiments on the side. For these, I will apply condiments on them. Plantains itself have taste on them, so there's no condiment.

Whenever I go out to enjoy my grandma's birthday or Chinese New Year, there will be appetizers of pickles and salted peanuts. These are  already flavored. There will always be a cup of chili and mustard for people who likes to eat spicy food. While I was in China for vacation in 2011 at a restaurant in my hometown, there was be a cup of soy sauce that is spiced with wasabi. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> During the Summer of 2011, I went back to China for vacation. On the final hours on the flight to Hong Kong, I had a stomachache that cause me to lose my appetite.

When we arrived the airport, we ordered congee and was able to defecate. On the toilet, I made a mess, which made the janitor rant about the mess.

When I arrived to my hometown, at times, after enjoying a meal, I ended up having to take a dump. Turns out that we are not accustomed of the local food.

The worst mess I made was after snaking on spiced sunflower seeds, I had to rush to my uncle's home to use his toilet. The toilet was small, making it hard to squat on. My feces ended up smearing on the wall. My uncle cleaned up the mess I made, saying that it is due to my digestion.

At the nearest restaurant near my home where we take the buses to get to the Hong Kong International Airport, we reserved a private room. Every time we come here, we spend 600 yuan every time we eat there. In the room, I defecated on the sides of the squat toilet. I told my dad, but didn't inform the workers. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> NYC Subway vs. Tokyo Metro/Toei </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-04 02:25:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are differences between NYC subway vs. Tokyo Metro/Toei. I will covering several significant points I found.

When riding the trains during rush hour, trains are usually crowded. Passengers would always have to squeeze into the train until there's no space. The doors will not fully close as there will more passengers squeezing through closed doors. In Tokyo, passengers would have to be pushed into the train until there's no space. Trains have to come in close proximity to each other.

The fare is a flat rate with a free transfer within 2 hours. In Tokyo, the fare is distance-based with a transfer fee for the two systems.

The rolling stock receives electricity via third rail. The older trains (RXX) require announcements from the conductor. The newer trains (RXXX) have automatic announcements and a strip map or the FIND systems that displays the stations the train will stop. In Tokyo, the older trains (XX series) use a strip map but the 01 and 02 series use third rail while the newer train (XXXX and XXXXX series) have LED screens that displays the stations the train will stop and use overhead lines. Each train have a designated colored strip to indicate which line the train runs on.

The subway system does not offer direct service to other commuter rail. In Tokyo, there are direct service into commuter rail lines without having to transfer. The pro of this service is that it's convenient and leads to less crowding. The con of this service is that it can be confusing. One would have to look at the train announcements in the stations to see their destinations and notes regarding it's service.

We use the metrocard to enter the subway, which will be replace with smart cards that is implemented in PATH. In Tokyo, one will have to get a ticket or use a smart card to enter.

Each station have a train countdown clocks, which is new. There are travel stations that announces planned service changes or delays. In Tokyo, there are train announcements that displays the arrival times of the next trains.

Trains can run express in one borough but become local in another. In Tokyo, the Tozai, Fukutoshin, Asakusa, and Shinjuku lines have their own express services, which local and express have their own different direct service destinations into commuter railway lines.

The subway operates 24/7 with limited services during late night. There are maintenance work during midday and weekend, until the fastrack program was implanted, where maintenance work is done during late night. In Tokyo, the subway doesn't operate between 12am and 5am for maintenance services. By then, people would have to drive or to use buses.

The map doesn't code each station for tourists. There are posters of planned service changes in English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Hindi, Russian, and Creole. In Tokyo, each station are coded for tourists. Train announcements are made in Japanese and English. The ticket machines have English, Chinese and Korean versions. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Riding the Newark Light Rail </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Came here to ride on the light rail after having the lunch rodizilo at Brasilia Grill. The fare is cheaper than the NYC subway, the PATH, and the Hudson-Bergen light rail.

When the tram arrived, the Broad St-bound car left first. The tram car opened the door to pick up more passengers. The Grove St route is fast and doesn't share any of its segments on public roads, compared to the Broad St line. In Japan, this kind of tram line wouldn't be consider a tram line, rather a railway line.

At Grove St, there aren't a lot of passengers as the terminal is outside Newark. At Penn Station, the trains terminate at the side platform where we exit. It's like a balloon loop for trams, especially during the weekends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today, I had a Financial Accounting Midterm. Before taking the midterm, I went to tutoring at the SACC. We asked questions and use logical reasoning to solve them.

The last time I took the midterm, I did poorly and have to drop the class. The subway was delayed due to a thief getting side-swiped by a train operating on the opposite direction of the thief. This almost got me late to the exam. There were a set of questions that require me bubble in more than one answer.

This time, when I came to take the midterm, the professor lets us omit the last three questions, one of them being an extra credit question. I was able to understand most of the questions. There were 97 question to be answered in 140 minutes, giving us about 86.5 seconds to answer each question.

I was able to finish the exam 30 minutes before time is up. Upon leaving the lecture hall, the professor shook my hand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During my time at the intermediate school near my house, I used BrainPop in some of my classes. BrainPop is a educational website that is hosted by Tim and Moby.

The teachers in the school uses this to introduce a new subject. The videos range from 3 to 5 minutes. There is a 10-question quiz after each video, which is useful when my 8th grade science teacher uses the quiz grades for extra credit.

Later, BrainPop included ESL hosted by Ben, Jr. hosted by Annie, Education for teachers and parents, and Gameup for educational games. A subscription is required to gain full access, which the intermediate school lapsed during 7th grade. The social studies teachers signed up a free trial offer before the school renewed it.

Now that I am an adult, I have though of parodying it in a future short on Cyanide and Happiness or featuring Tim and Moby in a skit on Robot Chicken, where Moby gives a golden shower to Tim. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why America Capitalism is Flawed </TITLE>

	<TEXT> America, compared to Canada and any EU county, is capitalistic. We see social class divide between the poor and the rich, and the decline of the middle class. We are seeing college graduates being underemployed or unemployed.

We know that in a capitalistic society, there will be competition and and a social class hierarchy. We see people living in college debt. In a socialist society, everyone have a fair chance of succeed. There is universal health care and college.

Ever since the 2008 recession, America have turned to the worst. Umployment rose, incomes stagnate, corporations became rich, and the social gap has widened.

2016 was a pivotal point in US history. We see that people appreciate Sanders ideologies. However, the DNC rigged to election that caused Trump to become the next president after Obama. The US became polarized and California wanted to secede from the union. Currently the twitter handle bluexit became a trend and the 20 blue states will want to. These 20 blues will likely follow Sander's ideologies.

If Sanders was to become the next president instead of Trump, we would see a radical change with socialist reforms and the US would be much better off than with Trump. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Spin-off or Derivative of Niyandar Kamen </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-19 18:20:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have thought of a possible spin-off or derivative of Niyandar Kamen. This one is an alternative world of the original show. I originally thought of calling it Nyago's Adventure Time(), but due to possible copyright issues, I changed it to The Wanderer of the Skeleton Capital(). Now, the spin-off is called Shin'nosuke the Adventurer().

In this spin-off, there was a nuclear war. The effect of the war killed off every cat in the process. The main character, originally Nyago, will be called Shin'nosuke Yanagawa(). His parents gave him up to an anthropomorphic morphing pteranodon's family for safety reasons.

15 years after the event, we see Shin'nosuke at the age of 20 with his adoptive pteranodon brother Hideto Tomita(). Shinosuke seen possessed a katana and wakizashi daisho pair on his belt on pants. He also has a black backpack. Hideto have a job which Shin'nosuke is a freelancer.

The setting resembles a samurai town with Edo-period building and a castle. The skeleton king is now a figurehead and all ruling power goes to a shogun or generalissimo, who rules like a prime minister. Each district in the skeleton capital ruled by a mayor who gets elected by the people themselves (Japanese government systems reference). In addition, there are fragments of Cat Town.

Hideto will have a girlfriend who resembles a Chinese deity who can speak Cantonese. He also have a tanuki cousin Hayato Saiki(), who told Shin'nosuke that his parents were unlikely while there is a diaspora of other cats he have known.

The episodes would usually be about Shin'nosuke and Hideto's adventures. These sometimes have to deal with aggressive yakuza gangs, with Shin'nosuke hanging out at their gambling dens, as gambling is forbidden (Japanese gambling law and chanbara references).

The show will make references to jidaigeki samurai dramas and lampoons non-Japanese fighting styles. In one scene, Shin'nosuke fights with his katana one his right hand with the sheath on the left hand (Chinese wuxia reference). In another scene, Shin'nosuke fight with a wakizashi with a cooking pot lid as a shield (Okinawan timbe-rochin reference). In a third scene, Shin'nosuke is working as a bodyguard for a yakuza faction dressed up in a suit. In the final fight with a bodyguard of a rival yakuza faction in yojimbo attire, Shin'nosuke throws his katana at the bodyguard, which the bodyguard deflects, and draws his wakizashi (Makoto Fujita's Kenkaku Shobai reference).

After the first shogun retires, another shogun was elected and this one is unruly. He created rules by mingling with the commoners to understand their situations. He also has two bodyguards who also work as informants (Abarenbo Shogun The Unruly Shogun reference). His name will be Muneyuki Awaya().

There is a group of assassins-for-hire. The oldest assassin passed away, so the group needed a new assassin. That's when Shin'nosuke join. There are already four assassins: a red fox police officer by the name of Shigeru Hinoki(), a raccoon restaurant owner and chef by the name of Atsushi Aoi(), a blue jay freelance graphics designer by the name of Tadashi Sugi(), and a female European rabbit police officer who is an informer for the assassins who is also a freelance geisha by the name of Tomoe Hara(). The deceased assassin was a retired eagle officer by the name of Naomori Fuji().

The victims get reminded by Mitsuko to go to a secret hideout and leave 10,000 yen. The group of five split up the payment and prepare themselves for the assassin. Shigeru uses a katana, Atsushi uses a whip with a snake head at the end, and Tadashi uses a needle that can reach to the heart.

It seems that Shin'nosuke is the only last cat in the Skeleton Capital. However, his grandfather went into hiding during the war and later become a godfather. When an another godfather encroached into his territory, Shin'nosuke fought off the underlings. The godfather's name is Takashi Ono(); before the war, it was Saburo Yanagawa(). After Shin'nosuke found out Takashi was his grandfather, Shin'nosuke vows to protect him.

One notable recurring character that will be featured is a governor who is an adult Anpanman resembling Oda Nobunaga by the name of Naganobu Osawa(). Shinnosuke is in town, hears a commoner's concern's, then informs Naganobu of a situation. They then seek new updates of the situation. After the perpetrators of the injustice are identified, Shinnosuke dispatches the henchman, while Naganobu dispaches the perpetrators.

Ever since Shin'nosuke was adopted, he never forgot his long lost sister. When Shin'nosuke and Naganobu stop a bank heist, Tomoe and a female coworker came to arrest the robbers. The coworker happened to be his sister by the name of Azami Fujiwara(), 18 years old. She and Tomoe are coworkers, and currently a detective. Her preferred weapon is an shikomigasa which consists a hidden sword inside the stick, a spearhead at the tip of the umbrella inside the spike, and the ferrules act like a sawblade when spun.

While confronting the suspect in a murder case, she had a shootout when she got shot, ending up in a coma. Shin'nosuke and Tomoe blame themselves for arriving late.

After a few years of meeting her, Tomoe invited Azami, Shin'nosuke and their grandfather to her wedding. In the wedding, Tomoe's ex crashed the wedding, threatening to kill the groom. Shin'nosuke confronts the ex and ends up slaying the ex in the fight.

The team of assassins once slain the commissioner for child molestation without a condom, who was dating Azami. After realizing that he was the molester, she received death threats. The commissioner was acquitted for his crimes. After realizing the mayor was also violated, she pays the assassins. 

Come to think of this spin-off, I have thoughts of this being a rip off as some of the contents are similar to Adventure Time.

I want to air the spin-off on YouTube if TV Nippon rejects the spin-off. If the spin-off can get aired on YouTube, a season would be from May 8 to March 1. If it gets accepted by TV Nippon, then a season lasts all year long. </TEXT>

There will be a election in France to determine if Le Pen will become the next president. If Wilders won, Le Pen would have ultimately won.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Lately, we heard news of Trump's deplorable budget cuts. These cuts will hurt the red states more. However, some GOP members are skeptical of the budget because the budget underfunds popular social programs and is unfair.

Putting more money into the military and national security is meaningless. We will be engaging in unnecessary and disastrous fighting that will cost the military and civilians lives. Mass deportations and incarceration will hurt local economies.

However, blue states will counteract the budget cuts. They will raise their own taxes to fund programs people wanted, i.e. universal healthcare and free college. People will be happy and will see that the congress is out-of-touch and don't care about their proposals.

People in red states will suffer. They will vote their senators and representatives out and replace them with ones that will give them social programs they wanted. Otherwise, there will be an exodus of the poor, marginalized, and the minority into blue states, giving them more tax revenue.

Update: In New York, the state government passed a budget that offers working and middle-class families free public colleges, starting Fall 2017. </TEXT>

When a costumer enters a restaurant, they order some food and receive a password to the wifi printed on the receipt or written on the take-out menus. This is useful for a person who needs to get work done.

When a person needs to use a phone to look up some information, they don't have to use their network internet. Using the free wifi can save precious cellular data one can use per month. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The congress is planning to replace the ACA with Republicare, which costs more that covers less. We already saw how ACA is flawed as we see high premiums.

The ACA was implemented in 2010. The insurance plan was derived from Ronmeycare which backlashed in Massachusetts. We saw the number of people employed in the plan reaching 11 million. In a leaked email in Wikileaks, if Clinton was president, she would dismantle Obamacare and replace it with a universal health care system, similar to what is offered in Europe.

With the Republicare replacing ACA, 10 million will lose insurance and it will basically backfire. Trump said that if the plan fails, which is likely, he will blame Democrats. It's not logical, as Democrats wouldn't support it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lately, we heard news of republicans ignoring their constituents. This is a good thing as the constituents realize what deplorable and regressive proposals they are making. People will do anything to stop them. Even Sanders like what the constituents are doing. Rep. Peter King of New York said that he's refusing to do town halls because "angry protesters 'diminish democracy'." That's not true, as he constituents are practicing their freedom of speech.

However, some republicans did not skip out on their town halls. They have to balls to clarify their intentions and/or tell them what they want. The constituents are sharing with the republicans what President Obama did for them, especially what ACA has to offer to them. Others would try to silence the constituents with arrest. These people are unlikely to be stoppable.

If the republicans goes forward with their deplorable and regressive proposals, the constituents will vote them out next year. </TEXT>
