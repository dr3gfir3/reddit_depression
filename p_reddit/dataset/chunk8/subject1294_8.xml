	<TEXT> I believe they will. But, if West Ham don't play Payet for 6 months till the summer his value will be less than 10m in July. West Ham is the one losing again. 

Btw, checked at transfermarkt and he has contract till 2021. In my opinion he made a huge mistake coming out with that kind of statement. He could have asked to leave last summer or at the end of the season, but this way he complicated life for himself and the club.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't want to take side for any club, but why would Marseille pay that fee to West Ham for a player who will probably never play for them again. I would do the waiting game and get him cheaper, because if West Ham doesn't sell him, they are the ones who are losing. His value will only go down.  </TEXT>
