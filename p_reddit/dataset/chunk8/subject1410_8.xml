	<TITLE> [Male Orgasm] Tingling sensation after orgasm </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This new years eve, I had company home with an acquaintance and they (as in one non-binary person) slept at my place. The day after, I received a blowjob and when having my orgasm my face and my hands started tingling and kept tingling for a good 5-10 minutes afterwards.

You know the feeling you get when your hand/arm/leg/whatever falls asleep and the blood comes back? That tingling sensation.

Anyone else that has experienced it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My experience with the Siberia 800/H Wireless </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-20 23:49:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For those not knowing - before making the Siberia 800 a part of the Siberia family, it was named H Wireless.

I'm going to make the introduction and story short. I had some major complaints regarding a (now discontinued) model of headphones and the service I had received from SteelSeries and after posting here about what happened I was given a pair of H Wireless as compensation. I've had them for about a year and a half now.

I want to share my experience with the headphones.

First, the positive things.

* The ear cup size is fantastic. They are big enough to cover my ears and my ears don't hurt after a few hours of use.

* The sound quality is fantastic. The surround sound is amazing, even on wireless.

* The foam in the headband/headrest (what do I call it?) is still respondent, minus the part of the foam that is in 100% contact with the top of my head at all times. It's still soft though!

* The size of the headphones itself is a big plus. Since they are wider than usual, they don't press as much against my big head, in comparison to other headphones.

* The mic quality is also fantastic. It's crisp, clean and nice!

* It feels sturdy and heavy when holding them in your hand, but not heavy on the head.

And also, the bad parts.

* The transmitter is unresponsive. When using the scrolling wheel on the headphones, you never know if it's going to scroll down three times or one time when scrolling through three "clicks" on the wheel.

* The transmitter doesn't load the batteries as intended. It doesn't even show the correct energy volume of the batteries. It can say that a completely drained battery is fully charged.

* I have to put the batteries in at a certain angle for the transmitter to even recognize them being there. If I just press it in and down until it stops on the "bottom", the transmitter won't recognize it. Or it will say that the drained battery is full. Or flicker between charging, fully charged, charging fully charged etc etc.

* About a third of the time, the headphones won't recognize the batteries either. Nothing happens when I put a new battery in and try to turn the headphones on. My McGyver solution has come down to either blow air onto the battery socket and the battery; and if that doesn't work, put the battery into the charger for a "kick", or something.

All of the battery related things have been like this from the day I received them.

* The mute button has stopped working. The mic shines red, but it keeps transmitting. Don't know how long it's been going on since only one person told it to me about a month back.

* I haven't had problems before with the reach of the headphones to the transmitter. Until about two or three months ago where it wouldn't pick up my microphone, but I could hear what other people said. As soon as I came three meters or further away, the mic stopped working.

* Two small things. When tilting my head, I can hear something rattle in the right ear piece. Like something small is loose. The plastic on the microphone has cracked in one place as well, but I don't mind that.

So, this is my experience with the Siberia 800. Great sound, great fitting ear cups, great on the head and great mic quality. Unfortunately there's quite a few things that brings it down for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buying clothes online is a super risky business. I've seen lists of clothes people have bought from Wish that looks like this IRL as well.

And you know what's even more risky about buying clothes online? Not understanding that your body isn't the same as the models. </TEXT>

I really despise the people who suddenly goes "Oh, I'm gluten intolerant". There's even studies showing that non celiac "intolerance" doesn't really exist either.  </TEXT>

I've always lacked confidence in myself and my looks. I've shifted in weight through my whole life. From being rather overweight as a child to being underweight as a teenager.

Right now I'm at a more "stable" weight, but I struggle with both eating habits, body image and other stuff.

I've also never liked my smile.

So, what do you say? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course I play the game because it's fun in the beginning, otherwise I wouldn't play it.

Maybe I phrased myself wrong, but as I mention it is pointed more towards people who try to climb higher and higher in ranks (or have made it to higher ranks) without knowing the basic elements of the game. That is a reason I stopped playing CS:GO. I wasn't good enough to play with the people I played with. And I lost a alot. It's not fun losing over and over again.

Of course it's more important to have fun, but I can't see how things continue to be fun if you don't improve yourself. For example - how many would continue to play guitar if they only knew one chord? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came for some tips and tricks and realized I already do most of these things. But thanks for some small things!

I started playing D.Va because I realized how fun it was to harass and annoy the other team. I use this a lot for my own advantage. Especially on maps such as Eichenwalde and Volskaya where the boosters can be used as a flanking mechanic. I would say that it's maybe one in every 20 games or so on those maps where they actually think about people flanking them that way. Both in QP and Comp (Currently at around 2700 SR).

I also use my ult as a way of keeping players off the point. </TEXT>
