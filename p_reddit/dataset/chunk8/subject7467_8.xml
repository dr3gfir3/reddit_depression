	<TEXT> I did, and there is nothing about having a discussion, I follow this sub because I'm trying to understand them, not an easy thing.  Sometimes I comment to ask them why they think this or that, I didn't break the rules I was just asking and trying to debate. But yeah that was too much already apparently.

Weird thing is, after being banned and muted from talking to the mods, I can now go to the sub and post again. I won't though. Tired of being steamrolled. By the the way, one of the rule is : "no rascim". Lmao the first answer I got was "some cultures are better than others" and "African culture sucks compare to European one"

Yep, no rascim on sight, all good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is that really a thing here ? I 've heard a few people joking about it but I didn't know there was a storm season. What kind of blackouts are we talking about ? A day ? 2 ? 

Why are storms still an issue in a place where there is an actual storm season ?

Is it trees falling on electrical lines ? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> French Pastry Chef available in Adelaide. Anyone knows a good place I could work for? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-19 22:11:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey mates,

My gf and I just moved from Amsterdam to Adelaide and we are starting to look for jobs.

As a Pastry Chef from France with a proper work ethic, I won't be happy making low quality food, so before I massively apply in every hospitality business I see, do you guys know a good brekkie place or a good restaurant that works with fresh products?

I hate pre made crap and industrial food, do you know any place I should avoid applying so I don't waste my (and their) time ?

Thanking you in advance, Adelaidians!

This guy deserves jail for what he did.
Good luck OP I wish you the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it is not true ?

The DLC gets a higher rating not the core game.

Why do fanboys dont see they get milked by all those dlc ? Day 1 dlc ?! Seriously how can you defend them ?  They had everything ready but nooo you got to pre order or pay more to get Chaos, which is the core story line of the game. They knew every Warhammer fan would like to play Chaos.

Its like a football game that would put Real Madrid or PSG in a DLC. 

Its a great game and they know they can sell us more things since people like you are defending their dirty marketing strategy.

Nobody cares, but don't throw incorrect information to support your argument.

So the blood and gore dlc would have got higher ratings. Not the core game. Go ahead downvote me all you can, but I'm still right it was just a lame excuse.

	<TEXT> Oh yeah but CA would have been able to give the Blood and gore separately and optional for free while keeping their age rating low.

 Its just their lame excuse for getting some more coins from their community IMO </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No they are right to be proud of giving stuff for free.
I love their games, but they should feel ashamed of selling their games in pieces. The Chaos should have been in the vanilla game, as well as blood and gore. It's a war game, but blood has to be bought separately... 

Like you get DOOM but you gotta pay more to get graphic violence ? Nah ! 

The elfs and beastmen, ok I understand it's a lot of work and optional for players. 

The rest is just greed. </TEXT>
