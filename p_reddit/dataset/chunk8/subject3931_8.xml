	<TEXT> This is so common in silver/bronze where a Soldier can't even shoot a fucking Pharah out of the sky.

Should I keep going as Mercy? 

Should I switch to Zen so I can discord them? This seems risky because resurrection is so helpful when they'll inevitably feed 

Should i say fuck healing and switch to dps for myself?

I'm just honestly confused what I'm supposed to do when none of my teammates can aim. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Put me in my place, tell me why I'm wrong.

So I'm a Mercy main. Started off at 1900 SR, had a huge losing streak and dropped to 900 SR, now I'm back to 1500 SR. I've noticed that DPS players *seem* to be less effective as I climb, like their accuracy or positioning or *something* is lacking.

Is this just a case of being on tilt from a losing streak and *perceiving* their lack of skill? Because it doesn't make sense how they'd be worse at 1500 than they were at 1000, yet that's sometimes what it feels like. </TEXT>

I'm not saying this simply as someone who had a huge losing streak, but imagine the opposite: what if someone had a lucky string of wins where they were carried by their better teammates? Once that luck runs out in a few games and they're nowhere where they should be, they're going to make higher level games worse. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This might be luck, or if it's not, it might be obvious to a lot of you. But I used to lose a lot of games and I felt a little useless as Mercy despite keeping my team constantly healed. What I find is that my team doesn't really make any attempt to target the enemy Mercy. So when everyone is top health and the enemy healer is out of position, I'll take out my own gun and kill them.

I don't know for how much longer this will work, but for right now it's really helped me win a lot of games, instead of just HOPING my teammates will kill the healer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have kids of my own and don't really plan on it, so it's possible I'm overreacting here.

My sister is 22 and she has two twins that are 2 and a half years old. She doesn't really talk to them unless she's yelling for them to "Quit!" fighting or if she says "eat? do you want some food?" She puts TV shows like Power Rangers or occasionally something educational, which I guess is better than nothing, but SHE doesn't read to them, play with them, interact with them.

I wonder to myself, sometimes, why she didn't just get a couple extra dogs or cats if she's going to put in the bare minimum for parenting. Like I said, am I overreacting here? I've been around a few other kids around their age, and they could talk more than my nephews. I try to read to them every now and then, but I don't think that's enough if their mom or dad doesn't want to do the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I lock in Mercy almost every game. I feel really comfortable playing her. Someone asked me if they could have Mercy instead because he was in a two-stack with a friend, so I was like, sure, fine, I don't want to get this guy tilted before the game's even started. 

He was Mercy and his friend was Pharah and he barely healed anyone else all game. Scarred me enough that I don't ever want to give someone Mercy again if I can help it. What is the most polite way to tell someone I've already locked in my hero without getting them to throw the game or whatever?

And does Pharmercy ever actually work? I've played a shit ton of Mercy and I've never actually seen the point. For me, Pharah is largely a great target to fly to, so I can remain ever more elusive. Pocketing her doesn't ever seem to work, whether it's someone on my team or the enemy team. This is partially due to players doing what this guy did and ignoring the rest of his team. </TEXT>

As for the Kindle suggestion... that sounds good in theory, but I don't think I'll do it. I've had a Kindle for a few months now and I can't bring myself to finish most ebooks. They feel super disposable. I'll borrow a digital book, read a few pages, return it, borrow another one, on and on and on. Honestly, the only thing I prefer about ebooks is the built-in dictionary.  </TEXT>

Oh shit, I was going to mention this as a close second to Yu Yu Hakusho but forgot its name! It's so interesting, too, how the soul crushing first episode doesn't feel out of place despite being a comedy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm rewatching Yu Yu Hakusho right now and the first episode still gets me. While it starts to feel a bit sentimental and forced, Yusuke's funeral and the way his friends, family, and enemies react to it make me choke up every time. It's a great first impression, one that tells you while this might be a story about fighting, that the character development is just as important.

For one thing, I've read how there are a lot of challenging words in this monster of a book. The interesting thing is recently I learned there are also completely made-up words in there, like Wallace found root words in the Oxford English Dictionary and just created something new.

Is this something where I'll need a dictionary on hand at all times or will context clues work well enough? And for the made-up words, is it anything like A Clockwork Orange where you're confused at first, but the more you read, the more you understand the slang? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's got excellent cinematography but I feel like that's all it has going for it. The writing is pretty boring compared to Breaking Bad. And no, it's not for the reason people assume that it's "not got enough action." For me, there's no tension or reason to care. 

One of the best scenes in BrBa is when Walt talks to Crazy 8 in the basement, it's so well done. By contrast, the writing of Saul feels like nothing is at stake. Part of this is probably because it's a prequel. </TEXT>
