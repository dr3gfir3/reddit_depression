	<TEXT> Why I ask is, I got a Calamansi lime at Kiama a year ago and at 13 inches/325mm tall they all had fruit about 8-10 count, now this was transplanted in good soil etc and has grown to probably a mtr tall yet has the same amount of fruit even though I pulled most of the fruit off. FWIW It cost me $37 It's on a trifloria? rootstock but I have grown 3 from the seed and a mate has a rootstock tree of that type that I can use to graft these on. 

Anyway it's all interesting stuff, thanks for your input...

My single finger lime is hopefully going to fruit in the next year. My Meyer lemon has had a Possum eating the fruit/ will be relocated as will his relatives and the odd bandicoot. They touch my Hybrid Pineapples and they will swim with the fishes. In the process of putting up a simple greenhouse over them as the rain and subsequent cooler weather have not been good.  Cheers.... </TEXT>

I know you can get charged with being drunk and in charge of a horse, I find that amusing/confusing  as someone who has ridden some bastard horses in the past. They have a mind of their own sometimes.

Edit: that said If you hit and run, you should face gaol time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> High ground is good.

Chinderah is peaking higher than 74, in 74 the water went up as far as the servo near the Kingscliff sports fields/leagues club, A lot of the water will possibly work it's way down to Grafton in a day or so. Missus walked into a flood previous to 74, and Oaks avenue/Old Highway it was chin high, saw something bobbing in the water , was a roof of a Mini.

Missus drove our 808 wagon into a flood on the shortcut from the Highway to Pottsville once, then pushed it deeper, :) at night carried the son up to a farm on the hill and guy dragged it out with his tractor, water over the seats, I drove up the next day and sprayed a can of WD-40 started and ran o.k. so you could be lucky. </TEXT>
