	<TEXT> That is an incorrect stereotype -- individuals with autism can read emotions and feel empathy. Here's an article that discusses the overlap between autism and alexithymia, a condition defined by a difficulty understanding and identifying ones own emotions. The authors found that:

 Individuals with autism but not alexithymia show typical levels of empathy, whereas people with alexithymia (regardless of whether they have autism) are less empathic. So autism is not associated with a lack of empathy, but alexithymia is.

We think these results, and the others we have found since, disprove the theory that autism impairs emotion recognition. If people assume that someone with autism lacks empathy, they will be wrong about half the time (because only half of individuals with autism have alexithymia).

	<TEXT> u/destinyvendetta - I commented in the other thread, but in case you don't see it, I'll paste it here:

These images reminded me of the sketches on the cover of my Grandpa's WW2 flight log book. He wasn't in the Navy, though - he was a pilot in the RCAF, so it might just be a coincidence! What are the initials?

	<TEXT> Thanks so much! It's my 4th embroidery project so I am still learning. I used DMC cotton embroidery floss... 2 strands for most of it, but 1 strand for finer things like the little hands, nose, and eyes. And thanks - I think the overall effect of the overlapping is quite fuzzy :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first survey is composed of 14 statements, the second is composed of 16 statements. Pts are asked to rate their agreement with each using a 5-pt Likert (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree). The statements are messy in that there isn't correspondence between the surveys (e.g., words were added, removed), but there are a handful of statements where the only thing that changes is the subject. An example of one of these statement is: Survey 1: "I can related to my grade 12 school teachers"; Survey 2: "I can relate to the Program X mentors". Like you suggest, my plan was to present the results of these surveys descriptively... describing pts reflections on school, and then describing their reflections on the program. 

To me, they ultimately used a pre-post *design*, but not a measure that lends itself to pre-post analyses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much for your thoughtful response. Yes, agree, it is a very weak design (wasn't mine - honest!). Cannot say anything about causality w/o random assignment. 

Actually, looking closer at the surveys, they did something else that is very strange. The first survey concerns pts reflections on their experiences in their regular classroom, while the second survey (6 wks later) asks them about their experiences in the program "alternative" classroom. So, I am not even sure if it is appropriate to do the t-test anymore since the questions are about different experiences. Does that make sense?

	<TITLE> Test for anonymous/unmatched pre-post data? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-23 12:27:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello: I am helping with some analyses and I am wondering what test I should be using for **unmatched** pre-post data. The same group of youth completed the pre and the post 6 wks apart, although fewer completed the post as some dropped out of the program.

From what I have read, a paired samples t-test is inappropriate because the data is unmatched, and an independent samples t-test would violate the assumption that the groups are independent. Should I just use an independent t-test and sacrifice the power? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, there is a substantial body of research critiquing the Big Five. Critiques concern issues with factor analysis and the unorthogonality of the factors (see [Musek, 2007](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656607000256)), inherent problems with lexical analysis (see [Trofimova, 2014](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085677)), and the non-theoretical basis for the model (see [Eysenck, 1992](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/019188699290237J)), for example. [Musek (2007)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656607000256) discusses The Big One - what u/ieatbabiesftl was alluding to (I think), as well as u/hollth1 and u/PsychoPhilosopher.

Block outlines pretty compelling arguments in his [(1995)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7724687) and [(2010)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10478401003596626) papers.

 The five-factor conceptualization of personality has been presented as all-embracing in understanding personality and has even received authoritative recommendation for understanding early development. I raise various concerns regarding this popular model. More specifically, (a) the atheoretical nature of the five-factors, their cloudy measurement, and their inappropriateness for studying early childhood are discussed; (b) the method (and morass) of factor analysis as the exclusive paradigm for conceptualizing personality is questioned and the continuing nonconsensual understandings of the five-factors is noted; (c) various unrecognized but successful efforts to specify aspects of character not subsumed by the catholic five-factors are brought forward; and (d) transformational developments in regard to inventory assessment of personality are mentioned. I conclude by suggesting that repeatedly observed higher order factors hierarchically above the proclaimed five may promise deeper biological understanding of the origins and implications of these superfactors.

	<TEXT> The authors make no such claims (I can send you the paper if you want - or you could e-mail the author directly - he got back to me very quickly). As noted in the Abstract, they studied Jewish Israelis and Muslim Palestinians and that is it. The quote discussed above is from the Significance section - not the Abstract. Note the language that the authors used:

 "Beliefs about God **may** promote more equal valuation of human life regardless of religious identity, encouraging application of universal moral rules to believers and nonbelievers alike. "

This is a point that the authors likely brought up in the Discussion/Future Directions section(s) of the paper (it is standard for researchers to ponder the implications of their work in these sections... which usually end with "Future research is needed..."). They are not claiming anything beyond the scope of their research. 

I agree, though, it would be very interesting to conduct this study with different religious groups, and like you said, consider magnitudes of belief. The authors discuss this themselves in their Discussion section.

	<TEXT> To be fair, you said you reached the same conclusion as tomrhod, and you did not answer my q (What do they need a control group for? The point is that to Muslim Palestinians, Jewish Israelis are 'nonbelievers' [i.e., they do not believe in Allah]). 

The authors were examining relations between Jewish Israelis and Muslim Palestinians only (their main DV was ingroup bias). To criticize the paper for making "proclamations about nonbelievers when they weren't included in the study in the first place" as tomrhod did simply means that s/he misinterpreted the meaning of 'nonbelievers' in the first place, and misinterpreted the point of the study.

I hope the e-mail I posted cleared this up. </TEXT>
