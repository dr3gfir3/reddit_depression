	<TEXT> This brought tears to my eyes! I am telling you that you can do it. Before my surgery I struggled every day with the same feelings as you...I had no idea if anything was working and I always felt low on energy. Just give it some time and you will pull through. Just try to focus on something positive and happy :) I find the sunshine really helps me...when i'm feeling low because I've had a slow week or I'm lacking energy I sit in the sun :D </TEXT>
