Making money, in a short term gain of it all as by quarterly reports, like most corporations do will do their best to screw anyone who might get a net + because if once person wins then by logic they loose. Mutual beneficial outcomes means competition does better so you loose. That is some of the very logic most of these companies run on. </TEXT>

White is Anglo Saxon Protestant as being catholic upbringing I wouldn't be considered white because of being catholic. So if you are slavic you are not white. Russian? Not white. French? Not white. Swiss? Not white 

So kid tell me again about your people and culture and language? Because I'm sure I never heard of white and whitish or the traditional dances of whitemen. Unless we include polka, but that is again polish which is slavic and catholic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Citizens ask their elected representatives to dictate a mutual agreed upon boundary. We remove that when we remove them and place in new elected officials. The point is that we allow pretty much anything under the sun to be said in america except for 7 curse words on the radio and broadcast tv. But most of the public airwaves pretty much you can say anything unless its 1.) the open request for assassination of the sitting president or elected officials 2.) the call for violence by mob or by organized group 3.) yelling fire in a crowed place 4.) and 5.) intentionally spreading information for the sake of financial gain, example forcing a run on the banks or sale of shares of a company using some place of power to do it and then making a profit from the chaos . </TEXT>

Also he was getting paid for another job while he was a commissioned officer meaning he didn't get permission beforehand which is a violation as well for the sake of trust since it might mean he is taking payments for an organization that has financial ties or special choice for military contracts And you need permission first because they need to vet that factor from any side work enlisted active officers do. </TEXT>

In cities it would be closer to $20 an hour since large metro cities usually pay higher salary than the minimum wage because of the cost of living. Put that into context to your wife's pay then as well. Its estimated that the average american is making 15% less than they would have in equal dollars 30 years ago because of the fact we have allowed minimum wage to stagnate and not match inflation as the bottom level payment  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Subversive art helps galvanize people. Sculpture, paintings, Graphic design, illustrations, and literature are all ART.

To say no one was affected by Political Cartoons, Plays, Art, means you have no idea what the heck you are talking about. Subversive art allows people to see a contextualized view of resistance and open defiance that rallies them. 

From the American Revolution to modern times Subversive art actually has created rallying around moments. Join or Die political cartoon, drawn by Benjamin Franklin and first published in his Pennsylvania Gazette on May 9, 1754 is an example as well as classical traditional art that shows non-royalty or nobleman being tradesmen / craftsmen.

We could also go into litterature if you want. But the fact is political art has major waves of creating a zeitgeist of public resistance in a country or nation. It is at it's core ... memetic warfare before internet memes.

Duke and Columbia also have research looking at Twitter posts and finding GPS information for accounts designed to look like republican blue collar workers from for swing states nearly two years before the election that were created to swing in trump's favor public views, but the GPS posts frequently have them posting from the same location and in Russia.

	<TEXT> well even when I was skinny I had Sleep apnea. I had a surgery to realign my jaw because of TMJ that caused migraines and since then my snoring and sleep apnea has been 100x worse. 

While yes, if you are overweight you are more likely to have sleep apnea, it isn't 100% though as its a blockage of air and can happen to skinny people too but water weight begins to get up there and you can store fluids like nobody's biz

I see that as people corrupting a religion to serve their purposes politically and then dumb followers just taking it as scripture. I still get the purpose of religion for community but dumb fuck racists and pollute it and pervert it. The way it's states reads that that is all the religion is is just bigotry. When for many its a sense of unity. It's a hard line to walk though for some as joining the two as mutually exclusive is common like how we see all isotopes as radioactive in pop culture because frequently we see "radioactive isotope" paired together.  </TEXT>

I might be atheist but I went though all of the sacraments before I turned 18 with confirmation and and first communion so In the eyes of the catholic church as long as i'm not excommunicated I'm still and will always be catholic. 

Like i eat meat during lent and crap and i know shina and sunni who drink beer / booze and eat bacon. Just like Jews who eat BLT's and eat shell fish . So please save your strict dogmatic views to your own narrow world view.  </TEXT>

Doofus is just desperate for companionship and a sweet lonely guy. If anything he is sad he never had a family and anyone who he could act like a father to or mentor means a lot to him. Mask morty though is just a morty while jerry not super smart is smarter than morty and it's a rare time Doofus rick could have an adult companionship where he isn't mocked for his hair cut. And where someone just appreciates that he wants to do nice things for people. Jerry is desperate for someone to notice him and support him and If anything the Doofus / Jerry ( father / son ) relationship was the healthiest relationship sadly I think we saw on the entire show.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Doofus Rick is one who proved he was smart. He was able to make no bake brownies with a select bit of Alchemist level chemistry. He knows how to, stop and think before he speaks to know just what to say to be supportive. This takes a large amount of empathy which typically requires the ability to self analyze how one would feel in the situation if they were in the place of the person they are empathizing with. The pause shows a strong level of tact which is also a sign of intelligence.

He does not eat his own poop as said by  Justin Roiland in the commentary track on the DVD / Bluray. And the only people who say that are other Ricks.

So why is he a doofus then by the standards of the other Ricks?

Going to the season 3 opener, the best lies are told with kernels of truth. When Rick c-137 is going through his life and what caused him to be heartless it's the assassination of his child and wife. The Council of Ricks or perhaps even a time traveling evil morty did it. But in a reality where Rick never had Diane and his daughter to begin with he would never turn "heartless" and suicidal. Its most likely the council of Rick though or C-137 Rick thinks its them because why else would he utterly DESTROY them?

Doofus Rick is just as smart as the other ricks, he creates a portal gun, because, why else would the Council of Ricks let him join? He doesn't have the thought of Diane or his daughter in his mind taking precedence in his live over science, 

Doofus Rick is full intelligent Rick, who is lonely but a sweet person with just a Doofus bowl haircut. he understands complex chemistry, he Just is the nicest Rick because he doesn't have true dick punching loss like many other Ricks I bet.

	<TEXT> Fascists are for tight close connections between privatization for the public services with a strong military with unflinching jingoism / nationalism 

Communists call for collective ownership of everything but typically have been run by totalitarians.

Fascists though like Franco and Mussolini and to  some extent Hilter (who really pushed for private companies instead of state production) rule by de facto iron fist and if questioned have people with a bundle of big sticks (or fascis) beat people to death with them.

Its funny because Fascists actually have a faggot for their symbol (bundle of sticks)

people seem to confuse authoritarian and the two since the only examples of both are quite litterally been only ever run by a strong man authoritarian.

But communism can be run without an authoritarian but we have never seen one since most communism is actually not even true communism because most don't even follow the Marx view where you had  to be an industrial capitalist developed nation before evolving to working taking control of production and the rise of a communist co-operative state. Most like Russia for example were agrarian societies with little means of production and little in the way of a developed "middle class" to start with which is thought should be part of the precursor to a Marxian Communist society.

Fascism is just extreme right wing Authoritarianism and Xenophobia and Jingoism to keep the rabble in line   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our dog ghira had four seizures today. We took her to the VCA hospital after the third because the first two happened at 10 pm last night and 5am this moring the third happened at noon today and even though we had an appointment at 7pm scheduled we rushed her over and they saw us at 1pm

The thing that makes this worse is i was just in the hospital friday and Saturday night for treatment for what turn d out after a 5 day long migraine to be viral meningitis. 

I'm lucky im on medicare since im unemployed after an internship and going back to university as a returning student to finish up my computer engineering bachelors. 

But i just feel hopeless because i couldn't afford more for my little fur baby. 

Any suggestions on how to help with the nearly $1000 health costs for dogs? She is listed as an emotional support animal for panic attacks and depression for my fiance and I.

People who cat call women do so in a maner that doesnt get healthy people but only serves the selfish thoughtless wants of the one doing it. It forces that cat caller's will on a victim and forces that victim to be made to pay attention to an individual who typically is somehow impotent in another facet of their perceived depowered life.

It takes the power of self determination from the victim for the  attacker's / harasser's selfish need and want for attention or emotional manipulation and power over a victim. </TEXT>
