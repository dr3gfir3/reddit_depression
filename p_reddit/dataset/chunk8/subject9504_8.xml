	<TEXT> That was an emotional read. Thank you for sharing. Ask yourself if this is about your overwhelming desire to have answers or if you just need to connect with your brother again. It's natural to want answers and it's completely normal to want to know your brother. Whatever the answer is is OK. You're not alone. It may surprise you to know there are others in very similiar situations. I hope someone will reach out and pm you about this. Good luck. I know this isn't easy. I'm sorry for your loss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No personal experience, but her the best books I have read on the subject. They mainly describe the events surrounding the possession and are CREEPY AS HELL TRUE.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QX074Q/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8 btkr=1

Also, a recent case of demonic possession diagnosed by American doctor skeptic  Richard Gallagher, a trusted, respected man. He's writing a book, but the details are available online. I thought it was worth the 99 cents to download the New Oxford Review paper he wrote...great read...very creepy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I installed Wifislax onto an old eeepc as the primary OS and it works great. While Kali is good for lots of different things, Wifislax is only good for cracking wireless, but its very good at it. Also, most of the packages [from Wifislax] can be installed on Kali. 

One other thing, have you tried Blackarch? I read about it recently as the "OS that the real sec guys use", but I found it pretty useless. Just thought I would mention it. It literally has thousands of hacking-type packages.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have had unbelievable luck with Linset and Fluxoin when hacking WPA2-protected routers. They are both very similar to one another and are almost a social engineering/phishing attack. They're both simple to use and both automate everything.  If you live in an apartment with numerous wifi ap's then chances are someone will be stupid enough to fall for one of these attacks. I first heard of Linset when installing Wifislax, which if you dont already know, is an OS specifically dedicated to hacking wireless networks. Give them (Linset or Fluxion) a shot. They're simple to use and can be installed on kali if thats what you're using.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although it wasnt one of the issues he ran on, I think Trump will accept Climate Change. Intelligent people believe that Climate Change is one of the most important challenges facing the world. I also think that most Americans in the Trump demographic have compartmentalized issues that may not be on the scale of 'the environment'. They cant think that big.....yet. Their priorities are more localized: jobs, health insurance, retirement. Climate Change just isnt on their minds like it might be for someone who has the resources to think about it.  That being said, I do not see how Trump could ignore the climate issues. The world is pretty much on-board. America cant ignore it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello and thank you for this AMA. A few years ago a farmer in my area went to bed complaining of being tired one evening. When he awoke the next morning he was unable to move and speak, and his ability to breathe was failing. His wife phoned for an ambulance and he was taken to a local hospital and then flown to a hospital in a larger city where he was finally diagnosed with Guillain-Barre. His medical bills were enormous, an amount that he could never pay in his lifetime. So the hospital waived the entire bill. I cant imagine suddenly being locked inside my body and having to depend on others to figure out whats wrong with me.

Sorry for the long story. Was your case as severe as this? Was there a point where you were completely unable to move?  Thanks for sharing. Get well soon! 

THanks again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a damn shame that it'll still be business as usual no matter what these emails reveal. We are a nation of sheep and cowards, of people just trying to get by. Nothing changes. We-the-People are just as scared of the US as everyone else. We let ourselves be intimidated and basically have our rights shit on. I am not excluding myself here either. 

...is it time to organize? Time for We-the-People to do something? Take this into our own hands? My children and my childrens children are going to be living in a horror movie if something doesnt change. I am disgusted and outraged, but impotent when it comes to creating the big change that we all know we need..

	<TEXT> The correct answer is to use common sense. Usually 'Trusted Uploaders" have a green or purple skull by their names. They're safe. Also, if you are concerned then stay away from the recent torrents and only download from the 'top 100' section. Know the proper file extensions for what you're downloading. Look at what others are downloading. Watch out for the other things mentioned here also, inflated ratios, comments, etc. Pay attention.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked IT in a public library for almost ten years. Often I would work alone at night. I'm ashamed to admit this, but many times, late at night/early in the morning, I literally FLED my office, leaving my laptop open and logged in and leaving my personal belongings there because I became so scared. One of our branches was built on the site of an old railroad station and was rumored to be haunted. The place was spooky, and I am not easily spooked. I had many terrifying encounters there: disembodied voices/whispers, shadows, crazy and unexplained noises: bangs, thuds, slaps, all loud enough to make my hair stand on end. On weekends, late at night, sometimes early AM like 2-3am I would take my young son ghost hunting there. On one such occasion we were in the main area of the library snapping pics and attempting to record EVP's. It was an eventful night and we had both become unusually scared simultaneously. I was about to call it off and go home when my son asked loudly "if any spirits/ghosts are present and want to communicate show us a sign." At that very moment we both observed a book from the adult-fiction-area fall off of the top shelf and land on the floor. It landed open and face down...violently. This really scared us...and kicked in our fight-or-flight response. We rushed out to the truck and sped home. The next morning when the sun was up we both went back. The book was still there on the floor. I picked it up to the page it was already opened to and read the first sentence on that page. It began with our last name, which was also the first name of a character in the book, and went something like this, "...and then Lastname picked up the bloody knife and stood over the murdered body of..."  That may not be verbatim and I do not remember the title of the book now. It has been many years. We both still remember this night vividly. True story. If anyone is interested I will post more true stories from the library.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apologies if this has been asked. I frequently have sleep paralysis and have discovered that if I can stay calm during the initial phase of SP that I can immediately "fall" into lucid dreaming. Is this common? 

By "initial phase" of sleep paralysis I am referring to that suffocating feeling. I have to realize what is happening and convince myself that I am not going to die. Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats a good question. I showered regularly. I cleaned them as best I could with soap and a washcloth...and a stream of water from the showerhead. Occasionally I would attempt to clean them with a q-tip, which resulted in me thinking my ears were very clean. So I guess the answer is yes, I did clean them, but probably never properly.  </TEXT>

I would recommend the app FiSwitch to anyone using Fi.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was very impatient. I placed the drops in my ears one evening and expected results within an hour, but it wasnt until the following day that I felt movement in my ear canal and a slight change in hearing. Thats when I decided to use a bobbypin to see what I could do. This sounds stupid, but at first I thought I was pulling something out that shouldnt be coming out. I could feel that it was large, and it seemed to resist a bit. When I finally pulled it clear of my ear the relief I felt was amazing! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the most disgusting thing I have ever posted here, but maybe it will help someone. My doctor recommended some OTC drops (I dont remember the name, but it was some sort of oily liquid). I put 3-5 drops in each ear while lying on my side so that gravity would help out. Nothing happened the first day, but on the second day I felt something dislodge in both ears. I used a bobbypin and gently probed around in my ear until I felt something moving. What I pulled out was...a horrible abomination..from BOTH EARS...and I am clean..very clean- shower thoroughly sometimes 2x per day. My hearing immediately improved significantly. What I pulled out of each ear was a combination of wax, skin, hair, and death. It was embarrassing, but I learned how to keep my ears clean. The idea is that the oil breaks loose the "wax plug" from your ear canal and makes it easy to pull out, intact, with some sort of tool. Gross. I am so embarrassed now. Should have used a throw-away account. </TEXT>
