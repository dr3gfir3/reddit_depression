	<TEXT> I do know that LoS actually will remove stories for beeing too "NoSleep" which is great because it makes it a completely different sub, but I feel like this is a great idea.

2 suggestions:

1) Ask the moderation team of NoSleep to see if any of them would like to help you mod your sub. Just so that way you can make some type of connection piece and not be seen as a place that is trying to take subs from NoSleep.

2) Make sure you find someone that is proficient at CSS (or if you are then even better)

Good luck! I was actually thinking of starting one very similar to this! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I Am Responsible For the Death of Nine Students </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-06 16:07:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My name is Ben and I am responsible for the death of nine people. I was never placed with the blame, but I was just informed by a phone call that 4 students were now on the run. They were all wanted for the murders that took place yesterday. 

Of course, I was not going to turn myself in, but there must be something I can do to help those four students and somehow stop the murders. 

Two days ago I was walking around downtown looking for a job. I was fired from my last job about 3 months ago. I was broke and living at my parents house at the age of 33. Before you point your finger at me and call me pathetic for not being able to find a job let me explain myself. I have been looking all around my city for a job. I scoured online, filled out and submitted hundreds of applications, and even called back every single place that interviewed me and thanked them for giving me a chance.

Despite all of the work I put into finding a job, I was never offered a job. 

That is why when I saw a Now Hiring sign on the window of an older building I rushed into the entrance and maintained my composure before walking up to the counter placed in the back of the store. There were around 20 to 30 gray shelves splayed out randomly throughout the store. They looked rather newish, but the rest of the store looked to be plagued with age. The carpet was white with what seemed like hundreds of differently sized brown spots. Half of the paint was peeling off of the walls, and the air even seemed somewhat antique. 

When I got up to the counter the man slowly looked up at me with a frown set on his face. He looked me over before saying, What do you need? I stuttered back, W-well I saw that you guys were hiring. Um. I was wondering if you were still looking for someone. He looked back up at me and showed what may have been his version of a smile, but to me, it just looked like someone showing a brief moment of happiness in between waves of depression. All of a sudden, it felt like someone cranked up the heat. I started to sweat and I readjusted the collar on my dress shirt before looking back at the man with mock confidence.

After a couple of seconds of awkward silence, he stood up and held a clipboard out to me. I took it from him and looked down at what was written on the piece of paper. 

**Application of employment**

**Name: _____________**

**Upon hiring. You are required to stay at your position until someone can take your place.**

**Termination of the contract is strongly advised against.**

I looked back up at him with a look of confusion. He saw the look on my face and let out a short chuckle before saying, Just write down your name. The starting pay is $3500 a month. You pretty much get paid for sitting where I was sitting. 

Thinking about the money and becoming overwhelmed with the thought of 3500 a month, I shrugged my shoulders and signed the contract. He looked up at me with tears in his eyes and said, Good luck before running out the door. 

Confused, I tried to follow him out, but when I tried to open the door it would not budge open. I tried slamming on the door, but even as people started to walk by the door they continued to walk past the door without acknowledging my presence. Starting to get desperate, I took out my phone to call my parents, but my phone did not have any type of signal. I tried to call 911, but it was silent whenever I tapped on call.

It took me a little less than an hour to get desperate. I started to knock down the shelves and broke pieces off of them before slamming the broken pieces against the glass windows. No matter how much I slammed against the window the window did not break of even crack. 

Desperation hit me at around 3 hours. I yelled out as loud as I could at whatever could hear what I was saying. I tried climbing on top of the shelves and reach the ceiling, but every time my hand got close to the ceiling the ceiling would feel like it was moving up to avoid me. 

Five hours later the sun started to set. I gave up and sat down on the chair behind the counter. There was a computer on top of the desk. I tried to go through any type of social media, but everything was blocked. The only thing that came up on the screen was a program called, Moore. All it led to was a blank page. I kept it up and put my head on my arms and slowly drifted off into a fitful sleep. 

I was woken up by a beeping coming from the computer. I slowly lifted my head while rubbing my eyes and stared at the computer screen. Someone/Something was slowly typing out a message. It took around 2 minutes before I could fully read out what it said.

**David Moore. Pull up your Facebook page and post this as your status.**

*Henry Stevens has been following me after class every day. I tried asking what he wanted, but he has been silent while he continued to follow me. Hes following me now. Wish me luck I guess. Hope this creep doesnt try to kill me.*

I read it over three times before I double clicked the browser and saw that a profile was already up. It belonged to me, but everything about it was different. It said I lived in Blacksburg, Virginia. I worked part time at Teaching Other Students the Truth. I was a student, but it did not state the college it just said, Its Kinda Obvious Where I go to College.

I started to close out of the browser when the page popped up with a new message.

*Close out the browser and we will take a life.*

I tried to reply back on the screen but it would not register anything I typed. 

I know I should have just ignored it and continued to sit on the chair and wait for the next person to walk into the building, but I panicked. 

With shaking fingers, I typed out the status and submitted the post. 

Afterward, I clicked out of the browser and turned the monitor off before getting off of the chair on slept on the floor. 

This morning I woke up to what seemed like and alarm. I instinctively grabbed my phone and swiped my hand to the right, but when the sound didnt stop I slowly got up and looked at the computer. 

There were two messages on the page on the screen.

*Write out an emergency alert about these three students wanted for murder. Rachel Lavene, Henry Stevens, and James Robert. You must make type them out individually and send them out to the designated TVs, and write out a separate message to Tamara Johnson. Tell her that it is time. She must follow the three students running towards the parking lot. If you do not send this out we will take an additional 8 lives and you must send out a message to them that they are responsible for 9 lives instead of one.*

*You have failed to meet the time limit. Eight more lives have been taken. Do not make us take more. You have 20 minutes to send out the messages.*

On a small window placed next to the page, it showed a news segment about how 9 students were found beaten to death outside of the campus cafeteria. 

Without a second thought, I opened up the browser and saw four little icons on the screen. There were names underneath each icon. 

Rachel Lavene, Henry Stevens, James Roberts, and Tamara Johnson. I wrote out a message to each of their icons accordingly to the command given to me by whatever was typing to me. 

As soon as I wrote out the last message I heard the front door opening. I looked up and saw a man around my age trudging slowly into the store. 

He walked up to me and looked nervously at me. 

I looked at him for a second and wanted to tell him to run for his life, but I was selfish. I wanted, no needed, to get out. With a mixture of depression, fear, and happiness I stood up and handed him the clipboard with the application form. He took a glance and gave me a look of confusion, but with the same mock confident voice I discovered just two days ago, I told him, Hey man. It pays 3500 a month. Salary. Nothing to lose with that deal. I pretty much got paid for sitting on the chair. 

He gave me the same shrug I gave to the last guy and wrote his name on the paper. 

I set the clipboard on the counter and told him I was going to go take a smoke break. I casually walked up to the front door and when it opened, I ran as fast as I could back home. I looked back at the store when I got to the middle of the parking lot and saw that the sign was gone. There was just a completely empty store. 

Im back home now. My parents asked me where I was, but I just told them that I spent the night at a buddys house. 

I slept the deepest I ever slept yesterday night.

I woke up about an hour ago, and I feel completely guilty of the murders that took place. 

Im writing to you guys now. Please tell me what I should do. I really want to help them, but Im honestly too scared to get in the middle of what is going on. Im not a hero. Im just someone that was desperate for money.

This is the log of [Henry Stevens.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63llqs/it_all_started_with_a_false_facebook_status/)

So please tell me.

	<TEXT> I tell myself that life gets better 



But it's hard to remember 



The good times over the bad 



The times of happiness over sad 



Why we get up and continue to live 



Is harder as we have to give 



And never really ever get 



Except a bunch of regret 



But fear not ol' wounded soul 



Life is much better with a bowl

	<TEXT> that's completely disrespectful. That isn't what he was all about or why he stopped writing. Please do not outright knock an author down. This is not a place to do it. He has created stories that are far more than just "Blatant Body Horror." Did you even read all of his stories? Or are you just putting down an author who has put in more hours than a lot of other authors combined just so you can get yourself a couple of cheap upvotes and "lols" </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What Makes NoSleep Truly Amazing </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Seriously, thank you so much everyone. You guys have made me go from a very enthusiastic reader, to a nervous writer venturing into a whole new hobby, and now to a semi-confident writer! These past 4 months have been absolutely crazy for me. 

I really never expected any of my stories to get any type of positive feedback or narrated, but now that I am, I am still completely awed by every single positive comment and message. 

So moderators, thank you so much for keeping the rules in place and maintaining a consistency on which stories stay and which stories have to go. You guys put in endless amounts of hours maintaining a sub loved by millions of people.

Authors, thank you so much for being absolute motivators. Without you guys I would have never even started writing. Also, thank you for helping the new writers out. 

Readers, thank you for making this sub as big and as great as it is. Without you guys the authors would never have the positive reinforcement they sometimes need on their stories. 

Again, thank you very much. I really appreciate every single one of you, and NoSleep is a place I never want to leave. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> It All Started With A False Facebook Status </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-05 15:46:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, my name is Henry, and I did not almost kill David Moore. I am just a junior at a larger University in Virginia. I made great grades, I had a job set up for me as soon as I finish college at my fathers company, and I was finally truly happy. Of course, if it continued like that I would not write on here. Im writing on here because Im in the middle of an actual shit storm. A shit storm that I know will not end easily.

It took one Facebook status from a guy that was in my English class but never spoke a word to me. He was the guy that never really spoke to anyone; the guy that just stared off into space during every single class, but managed to ace every single test, paper, and assignment. That is why my blood ran cold when my Facebook wall and messages blew up with people asking me why I beat David Moore within an inch of his life. 

I tried asking them what they meant, but every single person ignored my question and kept asking me how I could be so heartless. It took the police two hours after my Facebook started to blow up to knock on the door to my dorm. I opened the door and they asked if they could come into my dorm. I gave them a short nod. They looked around and took a couple of notes down. After a couple of seconds, an officer walked up to me and said, Turn around and put your hands behind your back. He proceeded to tell me my Miranda Rights while putting the handcuffs on my hands. 

The next five hours of my life felt like it lasted forever. I had an endless amount of questions thrown my way. I tried to maintain my cool, but I still ended up crying 3 times during the interrogation. No matter what I said, it felt like I could not prove my innocence. They finally let me go but told me to stay inside of my college campus in case they needed to find me again. 

That was a day ago. 

Yesterday, I woke up, got dressed, and made myself a shitty breakfast of eggs and toast before heading off to my first class. On the way to my first class, I saw a huge group of people standing by the school cafeteria. 

Curious, I walked up to the group and looked in the direction of everyone else. Bile started to creep up my throat, but I managed to swallow it back down. A woman was lying in an impossible position. Her back was folded back and her head was poking out in between her legs. Her tongue was stapled on the middle of her forehead and her mouth was gaped open with her eyes hanging by the optic nerve. The grass around her was covered with blood.

Some students were taking pictures while a couple of students started to walk away from the scene as the police officers started walking up to us. I followed the students that started to walk away. As I started briskly walking to my class screams erupted from behind me. I turned around and saw the cops beating down the students with their batons. The sounds of screams and bones cracking caused the other students to panic. I ran as quickly as I could to my dorm room. 

When I got to my room I locked my door and sat on my bed while trying to catch my breath. The screaming outside didnt stop for another hour. I tried covering my ears, but the sound of the helpless screams went through my hands and into the very depths of my soul.

For three hours, I sat on my bed, frozen in fear and completely clueless on what to do.

When I finally managed to scoot a little closer to my tv I turned it on and changed the channel to the local news. Nine students were found dead on our campus this morning. There was a camera pointed directly at the location of the incident, but the only thing the chief of police could see was a woman walking up to the cafeteria at around 8:30 (Around 10 minutes before I saw her lying on the ground) and she was lifted up off her feet and folded back. As he proceeded to talk about the other students, around 14 minutes later, being beaten to death by something he could not see the news cut off and an emergency alert came up.

Henry Stevens is wanted for the murder of the 9 students. He is still at large. The police are now on the lookout for Henry Stevens. If you know of his whereabouts please contact the police. Wanted for murder. Henry Stevens.

I dont know why I fled. I dont know why I didnt just turn myself in and try to explain myself, but I felt like that was my only choice now. I grabbed my phone, ran out the dorm, and started to run as fast as I could to my car. 

While I was running I saw a couple of other students running as fast as they could to the parking lot I was parked at. Fearing for my life, I managed to run a little faster than them and ran into my car. I locked the door and started to pull out but a girl ran up to my car and flung herself on top of my car. 

I tried to get her off of my car but she held on tightly. I rolled down my window and begged her to get off of my car. She screamed back with just as much desperation, Please. I need to get out of here. I am being accused of the murder of 9 students. I promise Im innocent. I never did anything. Please. Please. Let me in your car. Without giving myself time to second guess myself I unlocked my car. She jumped in along with another girl and a guy. I drove as fast as I could out of the campus and out of the city. By the time we got around 120 miles out I drove into the parking lot of a local convenience store and turned towards the other two passengers.

The guy was first to speak, Hey man. The name is James. I was about to head out to my class, but there was an emergency alert. They said I was wanted for the murder of 9 students. I dont know why, but I ran as fast as I could to the parking lot. The girl next to him stared at him while he spoke. She looked like she was filled with more rage than all of us combined. She confidently stated, The name is Tammy. I saw MY name on the emergency alert. I knew the most rational thing to do would be to escape as quickly as I could. So I ran to the parking lot. Out of instinct. When I saw the desperation on your faces I knew I found the right crowd. After she said the last word she leaned back and got comfortable again.

The girl next to me looked towards to two in the back and said, My name is Rachel. I saw my name on the emergency alert, but I was scared. I dont know why they suspected me, but I panicked. I ran out of my dorm and saw you guys running. I am on the track team so I managed to catch up to you guys. 

We grabbed a couple of snacks from the convenience store and started driving again. After another 2 hours of driving, I found a clearing in the woods. I slowly pulled into the clearing and continued to drive before parking about a half mile into the woods. We all got out and walked about a half mile before finding a spot to set up camp. 

Im lying next to Rachel while I write to you guys. Please help us. We have been wrongfully accused of murder. 

Im confused, scared, and I dont know [what to do] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

	<TITLE> I Now Know Who My Roommate Was Whispering To At Night </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-04 15:39:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I flunked out of my first year of college. I didnt go to any of my classes, instead, I spent the entire year partying and getting fucked up on whatever drug I could get my hands on. 

My entire life I was sheltered by my parents. They never let me do anything that was not according to the Bible. If my friends wanted to watch the newest Harry Potter movie I wouldnt be able to go, because of the witchcraft promotion. If I wanted to go to the mall with my friends I had to give my parents a two-week notice so they could think about it. Nine times out of ten they wouldnt let me leave. 

That is why when I went off to college I went completely insane. I went to any party I was invited to and drank every single night with my roommate on days we did not have anything to do. As the end of the school year, I became desperate for a place to live. I could not spend another day with my parents. I needed my freedom.

So without giving my family any type of warning, I moved into a friends house. My friend (Craig) was reluctant at first, but after days of persuading he finally gave in and told me to move in as soon as the school year was over. When I got to his house I gave him my final 300 bucks and he told me that I had 2 months before I had to start paying him 200 dollars a month. Despite having to sleep on the futon that was provided with the room, I loved it. I still had my freedom and I even managed to find a job at the local Mexican restaurant within two weeks. 

The next three months by and I have never been happier. I was now a shift manager making a little over 10 dollars an hour and I could still go out and go to the same parties I went to last year. Craig wasnt really around most of the time, but whenever he was home he would smoke some of his weed with me and we would relax while watching whatever was on tv at that time. 

For the last three days, everything has gone to complete shit.

It all started with Craig running into my room in the middle of the night. I was doing what a lot of men do in the bed with lotion and tissues around their private area. He sat on the bed next to me for the next twenty minutes muttering the same thing over and over. She keeps yelling at me. She is from beneath our floors. Where we stand. She says she shouldnt be here. After getting over my initial shock, I tapped him with my non-lotion covered hand and asked, What do you mean underneath your floor? Some chick you never called back? He stared at me while muttering that same phrase over and over again. I scooted to the other side of my bed and started to ask him if he could just come back the next morning, but within a blink of an eye he jumped on top of my legs and shouted, She wants me dead. She was never grateful and she wants me dead! He got off the bed and walked out the door and left me confused for the rest of the night. 

When I woke up the next morning Craig was lazily eating a sandwich watching tv. I cautiously walked into the kitchen and grabbed a can of coke out of the fridge and walked into the living room. A couple of minutes of awkward silence later, Craig cleared his throat and said, Sorry man. Smoked way too much weed. I gave him a halfhearted laugh and the silence continued. He got up after he finished his breakfast and said, Got work all day today. You working today? I shook my head and he smirked before saying, Lucky. Dont smoke all of my weed. If you do just toss me a twenty or whatever.

I dont know when I fell asleep. I smoked a bowl and started watching a movie, but I woke up to the sound of knocking. With a jerk, I woke up and saw that it was dark outside. With a grunt, I pushed myself off of the couch and checked the time. 

8:15.

Shit.

The sound of knocking came again so I walked up to the door and opened it, but there wasnt anyone there. While I was closing the door I heard a loud knock coming from inside of Craigs room. I rushed to his room and threw open the door. Right when I heard a blood-curdling scream from all around his room. I tried looking all around his room, but after a couple of seconds of looking around, I heard the front door opening. I slowly walked out of his room and saw Craig looking at me with a confused look on his face. With a sheepish grin, I said, I wanted to find your Sherlock bowl. Mine is all clogged now. He grinned and walked into his room and came back out with his bowl before saying, Ill just keep this out in the living room now. Just let me know if you need to go into my room.

I gave him a nod and he walked into his room. After a small bowl, I walked into my room and fell asleep while watching a couple of dumb YouTube videos. 

The sound of harsh whispering broke me out of my slumber. I looked at the alarm clock and saw that it was 4 in the morning. I slowly trudged out of my room and followed the voices. When I got up to Craigs room I could hear everything being said.

**Craig:** *Leave. Dont leave. You shouldnt be here, but you cant leave. Why do you keep yelling at me?*

The next voice sent a wave of fear I have never felt before. It belonged to a woman, but every word she said was a mixture of a whisper and a scream as well as anger and sadness. 

**Let me go. Just let me go. Why do you insist on keeping me here?**

It was silent after that. I heard footsteps approaching the door so I ran back into my room. 

I couldnt fall back asleep that night. Thoughts kept racing through my head and every couple of minutes I could hear them whispering again. 

Around 9 yesterday morning I got out of bed and threw on a hoodie before walking into the living room. Craig was sitting on the couch staring at the sandwich in his hand. I sat next to him and said with a forced chuckle, Im moving out at the end of the month man. I just found an apartment that will let me move in with just 500 dollars down and Im sure you miss having your personal space. 

He looked up at me and stared at me before saying, You can just tell me the truth. Shit is weird now. You hear the whispering just like I can hear you walk up to my door in the middle of the night. I understand.

With a sigh, I walked out the door and rode my bike to work. 

That whole day I wanted to do the best I could at work, but I was far too distracted. Who was Craig talking to? Why didnt Craig just let her leave? How was he acting so casually about it in the mornings? 

I got off of work around 7 pm and pedaled as quickly as I could and got home around 5 minutes later. Craig didnt come home till 9 pm so I ran into his room and started to look for anything that could answer my questions. 

It didnt take me long. 

As I walked up to his bed I felt a small knock come from underneath my feet. I got to my knees and saw a small gap in between a couple of floorboards. I grabbed a pen from Craigs desk and jammed it into the gap and pulled up. A small section of the floor rose up and I grabbed the front of the section and propped it all of the way open. 

I honestly thought I was going to find a woman in the hole, but instead, there was just a small lunch box. I grabbed the lunch box and slowly opened it before looking inside. 

A thin layer of ash covered the bottom of the lunch box. I closed it back up and started to put it back in the opening when I saw a small piece of paper. 

To mom,

You will always live with me. I have always loved you, but you did not love me.

You yelled at me and told me to become something worthwhile. 

Well, now youre worthless. Youre just powder. 

No one knows where you are. Youre just trash now. Trash in a hole that no one will find.

Enjoy the eternity you will spend in the little makeshift hell I created you.

I dont care if you keep screaming at me.

Because I control you now.

I shoved the note back into the hole and closed it. 

Craig came home a couple of hours later. Hes in his room now talking to his mother and she is talking to him back. 

I tried to listen in on what they were saying from my bedroom last night, but no matter how hard I tried I could not hear anything. 

I managed to sleep for a couple of hours, but when I woke up this morning I felt even more exhausted than I did before I slept.

Im packing my stuff up now. Craig is at work, and I dont want to be here [when he comes back] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

	<TITLE> My First Day as a Taxi Driver in Korea </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-03 01:01:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Date: April 2, 2017**

**Location: Daejeon, South Korea.** 

**Earnings: Approximately $880 USD when converted from Korean Won.**

I moved to South Korea around a year ago. The main reason for the move was because I had a wife and kid and I was not making enough money. Originally moving to Korea was never an option, but one day my mother and father called me and told me that if I moved to Daejeon, South Korea they would provide us with an apartment and plane tickets. They would continue to support us until I started to make enough money to support ourselves. 

When we first got to Korea, I managed to get a job as an editor at a small conference organizing company. The money was not great, but they promised me a raise after working there for a year. 

When they refused to give me a raise after working there for a year, I packed up my personal belongings and quit the job. 

I thought I would be able to quickly find another job quickly but learned that finding a job in Daejeon is almost impossible. 

Three days ago, an old coworker of mine contacted me and told me that a local taxi company he started working would be willing to give me a shot. He asked me if I was interested and without a second of hesitation, I accepted the offer. I know most taxi companies charge an upfront fee to rent the taxi for the night, but the company he worked for was a little different. They just took 20% of your earnings. Which meant they were more selective about the people they hired on, but luckily, my ex-coworker (Jong-Seuk) put in words of praise about my work ethic and told them I was completely fluent in Korean. 

This morning I woke up, got dressed, ate a quick breakfast, kissed my wife and baby goodbye, and rushed out to my car. After I typed in the address Jong-Seuk gave me, I drove the five-minute distance to the office I would pick up the taxi cab. 

When I got there I took a couple of deep breaths and walked into the building. Everything about the building was dirty. The glass entrance doors were covered with a thin film of dust, the carpet in the office was tan with use, and the lady behind the counter was wearing a shirt that looked like it hadnt been washed for months. Ignoring her stench, I gave her my best smile and gave her name. Without a word, she got off of her chair and bent down. She stayed in that position for what seemed like minutes. I started to ask her if she was okay, but she stood back up and handed me a key before telling me the license plate number of the car I was using for the day. 

I gave her a nod and walked outside with the key in my hand. When I found the car I was going to use I got a little excited. 

For the past year I drove around my mothers 15-year-old car, but seeing the almost brand new Kia K5 (Kia Optima in America) I jumped into the drivers seat and started up the engine. After hearing the soft purr of the engine I started to drive around the city and waited for the dispatcher to give me my first job. 

Before I got my first job, I saw an old lady standing outside of an E-Mart (our equivalency to a Wal-Mart). I stopped the car and she slowly got in. She was carrying a small brown bag. When I asked her where she needed to get to she calmly said, Drive me around town. Let me relive my memories. I will give you 1,000,000 KRW (Around $880 USD). I shrugged my shoulders and started to drive around the city. For the first two hours, she was silent. She just looked outside and sighed occasionally. Right as we passed by a movie theater she yelled out, Stop. I slammed on the breaks and she looked at the building before saying, My old high school used to be here. This is where I first met my husband. He passed away thirty years ago. 

I tried to think up of what to say back to her, but my thoughts were disrupted by a soft whisper coming from the back seat. I turned around to see if she was trying to tell me something else but her lips were closed. Yet, the whispering continued. After a couple of seconds, the whispering became a soft spoken voice and then to screaming. My man. My man. My man.

The old woman covered her ears and started to scream at me. I didnt know what she was saying, but I quickly drove away from the movie theater. Once we were out of the parking lot, the voice stopped and the woman was quietly sitting in the back seat again. 

For the next hour, I drove around the other side of the city. As I started to get comfortable, I felt a hand grab my shoulder. I panicked and stopped the car in the middle of the road and turned around. The old woman said, Turn around. I will tell you when to stop. I took a U-turn and slowly drove until she told me to stop in front of a pizza restaurant. 

She pointed at the entrance to the pizza restaurant and said, My husband was found outside of the restaurant he owned. He was stabbed twelve times. I see it is some sort of bread restaurant now, but he used to create the most wonderful meals. People would come from all over the country to see how good his food really was. No one ever left with a sign of disappointment. That is what made it so surprising. I asked her, What happened?

She sighed and said, He was found outside of his restaurant with twelve stab wounds. He was still breathing when the paramedics came and picked him up, but on the way to the hospital he passed away. They told me that the last thing he said was.

She stopped speaking, but a voice came from right in front of me. 

Did you ever eat at my restaurant?

She closed her eyes and slowly took a couple of deep breaths. With a whisper, she said, I can still smell the meals he created. 

Scared out of my mind, I started to pull out of the restaurant. Right as I started to exit out of the parking lot a mans voice screamed out, Stop. I ignored the voice and drove out of the parking lot as quick as I could. 

I was done. I didnt care about the money anymore. I tried asking her where she wanted me to drop her off, but she ignored me and continued to stare out the window. Not really having any other option, I started to drive her back to the e-mart I picked her up at.

On the way to e-mart, she asked, Can you please just go to one last place? I promise it is the last location. I gave her a half-hearted nod and she gave me a weak smile before saying, Take me to Smart City Apartments. 

I plugged in the address into the GPS and drove breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that it was only 3 minutes away. 

Two minutes later, I stopped in front of a red light. We were just 300 meters away. I turned around to tell the woman we were close by, but the moment I looked at her I couldnt help it. I threw up all over her. She was looking at me, but her skin started to flake off of her face. I looked away and took a couple of breaths before I tried opening my door. The door wouldnt open, I desperately clicked the unlock button, but the car was jammed shut. 

The combination of fear and stress overwhelmed me and I started to scream while punching the steering wheel of the car as hard as I could. In the middle of my fit, the woman grabbed my shoulder. I tried prying her hand off of me, but her hand stayed glued to my shoulder. With a voice filled with desperation, I screamed, Please. Just leave. Dont pay me. I dont care. Just get out. She whispered after I stopped screaming. We are almost there. I will leave when you get there. I turned around and looked at her one last time. Exposed flesh littered across her face. Bits of her facial bone were exposed as well as a couple of her teeth. 

Choking back another fit, I turned towards the road, put the car back into drive, and drove the rest of the way to the apartment. 

When we got there I said, Get out. 

She said Thank you and I heard the car door open and close. 

I turned around to see her walk away, but I didnt see anyone there.

Instead, I saw the paper bag still lying on the seat. I grabbed it and opened the bag.

Inside the bag was a huge wad of cash and a couple of small newspaper clippings of just headlines.

**Local Restaurant Owner (Kyungsuk Lee) Stabbed to Death**

**Deceased Restaurant Owners Secret Ingredient was Human Meat.**

**Past Lover of the Cannibal Cook (Kang-Eun Kim) Found Dead Outside of Old High School.**

**Wife of Kyungsuk Lee (Eun-Hae Lee) is Responsible for the Murders of Kyungsuk Lee and Kang-Eun Kim.**
**Eun-Hae Lee Found Dead. Possible Suicide.**

On the last newspaper clipping, I saw in small handwriting. Wait in front of E-mart in the Dunsan area on April 2, 2017. There will be a taxi that will pick you up.

I tried Jong-Seuk, but he did not pick up any of my 4 phone calls. 

The money was nice, but I was still scared out of my mind. 

I dropped the taxi cab back and informed the woman working at the front desk that there was some throw up in the back seat. She gave me a grin and said, That usually happens with our first-time drivers.

It has been 4 hours since my shift ended. 

Jong-Seuk sent me a text 2 hours ago. 

I know its scary right now, but the money is good. You working tomorrow?

I havent responded back.

I dont know what I want to do.

The money is good, but seriously, who the fuck was I [driving around all day] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)?

	<TITLE> A Site Called RebirthMeNow Has Stolen My Identity </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-31 16:20:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> February 22nd, 2017

Thats the last day I remember. The last day I was Bradley Wills. I used to work as a waiter at an Applebees, but I lost everything. 

All because of a website called www.rebirthmenow.com. 

On February 22nd, 2017 I came back home and sat on my couch while I surfed around reddit. In the middle of looking at a heated argument about Trump on an r/funny post, I got a FaceBook message from a coworker (Johnny).

**Johnny**:*Yo man. crazy website. check this shit out. www.rebirthmenow.com*

**Me**:*That looks dumb as fuck dude haha what am I supposed to do there?*

**Johnny**:*No lie dude. fucking got 5 grand in my account right after I signed up. It told me to enjoy my life more. seriously dude. try that shit out.*

**Me**:*Alright, but if I get a virus Im gonna kill you dude.*

He never messaged back after that. 

Curious, I clicked on the link he gave me and found myself looking at a blank white screen. I tapped on the screen and waited. After a couple of minutes I decided to give up and started to turn my phone off when a single word popped up on the middle of the screen. 

*Wait*

I tapped on the word and it faded away before the screen bounced to a solid yellow screen. A couple of seconds later, a question appeared on the bottom of the screen.

*Are you tired of your life? Tap the middle of the screen 5 times if you would like to have a new life.* 

I rolled my eyes and tapped the screen 5 times while laughing to myself about how dumb of a troll this whole website was. The screen turned black and said, Wait. 

I let out a laugh and turned my phone off before walking up to my room. I sat on my bed and plugged in my charger. 

Thats the last thing I remember. 

When I woke up this morning I looked around my surroundings and realized I had no idea where I was. It was completely gray everywhere I looked. The bed was gray, the walls, the ceiling, my clothes, the tv, and computer were gray. I rubbed my forehead a couple of times and looked around for my phone, but it was gone. The only thing I managed to find was my wallet on the side table. 

It was a lot thicker than usual. I opened up my wallet and found a huge stack of hundred dollar bills. I counted it up before I grabbed the money out of my wallet and threw it on the ground. 

Five thousand dollars. Just like Johnny promised.

I checked the rest of the contents.

It was all wrong.

All different.

The cards were all in the same places I left them. The picture on my id stayed the same, but the name on my id, my credit card, and social security card belonged to another person. The numbers on my cards and social security were different. Not off by much, but still noticeably different. 

While I was looking through my cards I heard a sound come from the computer. I looked at the computer and saw small words on the screen. When I walked up to the screen the words started to get larger until Turn on the TV filled the computer screen. 

Nervously, I walked up to the tv and pressed the power button. The screen turned on and a slight hum filled the room before the tanned face of a news anchorman filled the screen. The headlines underneath his face said, Three missing. Chance Harrison is still on the run. 

I felt my blood rush from my face. The name that was on all of my cards said, Chance Harrison. 

I walked up to my cards and double checked the name and no matter how many times I closed my eyes and looked at the cards again I saw the same name. 

Chance Harrison.

I closed my eyes and tried to remember what happened, but I couldnt remember anything. My thoughts were disrupted by the voice of the news reporter saying, Chance Harrison is still the main suspect for the disappearance of Gregory Taylor, Samantha Wilson, and Ian Andrews. He has yet to be found but Matthew Smith, our chief of police, has stated that the arrest of Chance Harrison is their main priority. It jumped to a photo of me sitting at the bar staring at the bartender, then a photo of me standing in front of the entrance to a hotel staring at a woman exiting a car, and finally to a photo of me walking through a school.

I shut the tv off and sat back down on the bed. 

For the next hour I tried to jog my memories, but no matter how hard I tried to remember I just couldnt. 

The computer made another noise. I looked up and saw words on the top of the screen. Within a couple of seconds, the words expanded out and filled the screen. 

*Check under the bed.*

I tried ignoring the message, but every couple of seconds the computer let out another noise. It kept getting louder and louder until it pierced through my eardrums. No matter how hard I covered my ears with my shaking fingers.

With every ounce of my willpower, I managed to resist looking under the bed, but that is when I first saw it. A man was standing in the corner and pointed at the bed. Panicking, I said, Who the fuck are you? When did you get in here? Why do I need to check under the bed? Can you please. Please. Just help me. 

He let out a sigh filled with depression and disappointment before pointing underneath the bed. I ran up to him and tried to grab him, but before I put out a hand on him he let out a scream. I begged him to stop, but his screaming only got louder and higher pitched until he grabbed his face and started to rip chunks of skin and flesh from his cheeks and lips. 

I fell to the ground, shut my eyes, and covered my ears. With my legs, I scooted myself as far as I could away from the voice. I kept scooting further and further away until I felt the feeling of something soft and cold bump into the back of my neck. I turned around and saw three dead bodies under the bed. The bartender I was staring at had a bottle shoved into his mouth. His face was a deathly blue. The woman that I stared at getting out of the car at the hotel was lying with keys shoved into the middle of her forehead. There was a man. He looked to be in his late thirties to mid 40s with three small books shoved into his neck. 

Im writing to you guys because I dont know what happened. My name is Bradley Wills. Im a server at an Applebees, but Im getting framed. I have dead bodies underneath my bed, but I know for a fact I didnt kill anyone. The man that was standing in the corner of the room is gone, but I can still hear him screaming. 

The computer is letting me use all of the websites, but I figured writing on here would be my best bet. I checked on www.rebirthmenow.com again, but it is not a page anymore. 

Please help me. Im not Chance Harrison and Im [not a murderer] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

	<TITLE> My Third Life is Leaving Me Unfulfilled </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-30 16:18:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My name is Jacob and I am living my third life now. 

Let me explain myself. 

In my first life, I lived an unfulfilling life. I worked my whole life. My wife died when I was 40 and we never had a child. 

Before I knew it, I was 62 years old walking around the woods that surrounded my house. My whole body ached with each step, but I wanted to move around as much as I could before I lost the ability to walk. 

That is when I heard the south sound of nature beckoning me when I started heading towards my house. I stopped and turned around. The wind slowly guided me further and further into the woods. As I kept walking I could feel a soft vibration spread across the ground around me. I closed my eyes and let the vibration slowly move up my body. With a satisfied sigh, I sat on the ground while closing my eyes and finally felt like I was at peace. 

When the vibration stopped I opened my eyes and saw that the trees that were once in front of me were now gone. I was sitting next to a body of water. Water so clear that you could stare into the endless pool of water before I could second guess myself I plunged myself into the body of water and sank deeper and deeper into the water. 

When I couldnt hold my breath any longer, I opened my mouth and found myself sucking in air. Confused, I forced my eyes open and looked around. 

I was back in my room. 

The strange thing was that before I walked up to the mirror I knew I was 32 years younger than I once was, but instead of feeling happiness, I knew that my life was not going to get any better than it once was. I was in debt to whatever led me to the body of water, and for the extra years I was gifted. 

My second life flew by just as quickly as my first life, but this time I couldnt really marry anyone or show myself to anyone in our town in case I was recognized. The first 5 years went by without a problem, but by the time I was 35 I started to see a shadow stand by wherever I was. It didnt really do anything at first. 

Just observed. 

10 years later, the shadow finally slid towards me and whispered, Go down to the village. You will find a woman in the neighborhood bread shop. She will listen. It floated back and stared at me. I tried asking it what it was talking about, but it just rose up an arm and floated to the direction towards the town. 

I dont know why I listened to it, but I had a feeling that was the spirit I owed my life to. With a nod towards the shadow, I grabbed my things and ran towards the bread shop. When I walked into the bread store I saw a simple looking girl in a yellow dress. I slowly walked up to her and started to ask her if she could come to my house, but she cut me off and said, Lead me. Ill follow, but let me pay for my bread first. 

After she made her purchase I started walking up to my house with her following close behind. The shadow kept staring at her and examined her before looking back at me and giving me a small nod. About ten minutes later we arrived at my house and started to walk inside of my house when I noticed the woman walking towards the woods in my house. I closed the door and followed her. 

She stopped walking when she got to the start of the woods and faced the shadow. She whispered, Im ready. The shadow floated to her and expanded itself out until it completely surrounded the woman. She started to scream out in pain. I ran up and stared into the shadow. Her clothes were completely burned off and her skin started to bubble. She grabbed at her arms and ripped chunks of skin and flesh off of them. A couple of seconds later she was completely gone. She was the only one I can vividly remember bringing up to my house. 

For the rest of my second life, I brought up 19 other people up to my house. I dont quite remember them, but I know that I never got used to the way their skin and flesh melted off of their bones before disappearing completely. 

When I hit 62 again I followed the shadow into the woods. He stopped and I stood next to him. The vibration started to take over my body again. I closed my eyes and tried to capture the moment of peace again but it felt different. 

Fake. 

I opened my eyes and saw hundreds of people sitting behind me. People of all nationalities sitting silently waiting for their turn, there were shadows standing silently next to every single person. I looked to my right and saw that the pool of liquid was different. It was a deep red and slowly moved from side to side. I closed my eyes and dove into the liquid. 

I accidentally opened my mouth and felt a thick taste of copper in my mouth. Disgusted, I started to cough and thrash around until I realized I was back on my bed. 

This is my third life now. The shadow has grown larger than last time. 

It is now talking to me a lot more.

Whenever I bring a person to my house it gives a satisfying grunt before saying, Good. I will tell you when there is a new person to bring. 

Every night when I lie down on my bed I can hear it whispering to me. Always dive into the pool. It gets harder but we must be fed. Before I fall into a deep slumber it tells me, The only escape is feeding me. If you need to escape. Tell me.

Im 43 for the third time now. I dont want to die. I constantly feel unfulfilled with my life, but maybe death is an [easier alternative] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

	<TEXT> Hello everyone. 

My name is subject8631 and I have written to you guys before. This time I dont need your help. Instead, I am trying to help you guys by giving you a warning.  

I went onto the NosleepOOC chat like I do every single morning. Basically, its a place where authors and readers come together and talk about upcoming stories, stories they read, and a bunch of different random things going on in their life. I love it. Its a great place where I can explain out the stories I have written as well as offer critiques for other writers. 

One thing about the program we use for the chat is that it has a way where you can make your own room and talk with others privately. I never utilized that functionality. 

Never really had a reason to. 

I had everyone I liked talking to in one massive room. 

Today, I logged into my work computer and decided to check up on what was going on with the other writers. It mostly looked like the regular group of people, but there were a couple of new people. They were mostly asking about what they should do to fix up their stories before submitting, but one user (FearAndDesire) in the chat was being extremely quiet. I asked the others what was up with him, but no one really knew when he even came in. So I tried talking to him until he responded.

*Me: Soooo FearAndDesire. Cool name. what brings you here?*

*Me: Cmon man. You cant lurk here haha. Just say hi and Ill leave you alone XD.*

*Me: Dude. Youre going to get kicked if you dont talk. Do you read Nosleep? Or write? Do you need help?*

*FearAndDesire: #DesiresFulfilled *

Whenever you put a pound symbol before a word or series of words it creates a new room when you enter it. I clicked on the link and went out for a smoke break. 

I quickly forgot about the random user and started fixing up the website I was working on while occasionally glancing back on the Nosleep OOC chat. 

Two hours go by and I start to turn my monitor off to head off to lunch when I see several regulars blow up the chat. 

PrimalWishes was talking about how her childrens father just died in a car wreck and just found her neighbor stabbed multiple times. She told all of us to avoid the chat FearAndDesire created at all costs. She insisted he was to blame for both of their deaths. 

Im sure some of you know the writer that goes by the name of SailorScarlet. When she came back into the Nosleep chat she just typed out. Off work now. A couple of people died in our office. Boss had a heart attack and my friend was too close to a printer that blew up. Ill talk to you guys later.

Curious, I clicked on the tab I opened up before for the chat and read through everything. By the time I got to the [end of the messages I felt myself shaking] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8TIAOejvy-xTDMxenozek5aNTA/view?usp=sharing). 

I know Ive written plenty of stories, but I really didnt know how to approach FearAndDesire. I was scared for the people around me so I logged back in with a fake username and [went back into the chat] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8TIAOejvy-xOG5jZGJIMlp0a2s/view?usp=sharing).

I stopped typing back for a second to answer a call from my father. He was choking back sobs while informing that my mother passed away in a plane crash today. She was one of 30 casualties. 

I should have stopped talking to him then, but I was far too filled with rage for that. I needed to get back at them somehow. If they really fulfilled all of my desires I was going to give them one they wouldnt be able to [come back from]  (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8TIAOejvy-xOWVrVjFobk9KZ2s/view?usp=sharing)

My father had a stroke just three minutes ago. The owner of the company he delivered frozen food for contacted me. He took his last breath before the ambulance arrived. 

I wanted to end them. I really did, but I have lost too much. 

Guys, I know it may sound tempting to go into the chat to check it out, but if you do please do not request anything. I lost my parents. I left before I could lose anyone else. If you just want to talk to me about my experiences stay on the Nosleep chat. I will tell you whatever you want to know. If you have questions pm me. 
For proof go to the [chat room] (https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/desiresfulfilled).

Most importantly, do not think you [can beat them] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

	<TITLE> The Bible Has Become My Personal Hell [Final] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-28 16:05:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For the first part: [click here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/61s4x5/the_bible_has_become_my_personal_hell_part_1/)

We did not work today. 

Everyone was in a panic. 

We had two men dressed in red robes come in and look around for a couple of hours before they grabbed a deliverer and dragged him into the room the furnace was. Despite the distance, I clearly heard a voice start pleading for his life. When no one was looking I ran up to the door and pressed my ear lightly against it. I managed to catch what they were saying.

Deliverer: I promise. I swear. I dont know what the fu- I heard a slap and my blood ran cold. Two voices spoke at the same time. A low guttural voice that sounded like it belonged in the depths of hell and a completely monotone voice.

Them: Do not use foul language in the temple of God servant. Youre useless. You deserve nothing. You deserve death. 

After that, the deliverer let out a scream so loud I had to pull my ear away from the door. It was the scream of pure agony. I ran back out into the dining hall and sat down next to my elder. He looked at me and asked me what I heard. I just shook my head at him and placed my head on the cold metal table. 

A couple of minutes later, I heard the door open and slam shut. Before I managed to raise my head I heard gasps fill the room. When I looked at the two men in red robes walk up to us I noticed they were each carrying something. The person on the left carried a lump of flesh while the one on the right carried the skin of the deliverer. 

They placed the flesh and skin on a table and started to walk out the door. Before they walked through the door they turned to us and spoke in unison, The food is on the table. The answer for your salvation is on the table. Make use of the blessings we have given you. No more work. No more food. This is now your personal hell. The only way out is through Gods word.

I didnt care anymore. I know a man died, but I needed to get out. So did everyone else. If I have to investigate a dead mans skin I was more than willing. With a deep breath, I grabbed the skin and flipped it over to see what was written on the forehead section.

**Luke 15:11-32**

I called out, Someone get me a Bible. Lets get this shit figured out. 

A girl ran up to me with a Bible in her hand and tossed it to me before running back to her seat. I flipped it to the passage and quickly glanced over it. It was the tale of the Prodigal Son. 

For those who dont know. 

Kid was a spoiled little shit. Asked his rich father for his inheritance like a dumb ass and went to a nearby city and spent all of his money. Ran back home like a little bitch and what do you know. Father still loves him and he lets him go back home and live with them. 

Most Christians know the story, and honestly, it is definitely heartwarming, but how was that going to help us? When I looked back up from the Bible I saw my elder standing next to me examining the bottom portion of the skin. He looked at me and pointed to where the mans right ankle once was and said, These are the only words that are not part of the Bible.

I took a look at it and my blood ran cold.

*Deliverers, elders, and workers. Out of all of you. There will only be one prodigal son.*

Everyone quickly crowded around us and demanded answers. With a shaking voice, I blurted out that they wanted us to kill each other. The last one to survive will get to leave. After I explained it out, I tried to tell them we could all work together to find a way out, but within seconds the dining hall filled with swinging fists and blood. I quickly ran to the other side of the dining hall and saw the transition from people ganging up on one person to taking each other out one by one.

Within minutes, only one deliverer, 3 elders, and 2 workers remained. The mask was ripped off of the deliverer, and I got a good look at her face. It was the one that led me to her room. The one that let me get this message out. I tried to think of a way to help her out, but in the middle of my thoughts, I saw out of the corner of my eye an elder running at me as fast as he could. Without a second thought, I dropped to the ground as he got close and saw him trip over me. Before he could even get up I ran past him and ran to my room. When I walked into my room I saw my elder sitting next to his bed sobbing out loud.

Slowly, I walked up to him and saw blood seeping through his shirt. I grabbed his shoulder and turned him around and tore off his shirt to see if I could help him. Upon first glance, I knew he was far beyond help. All around his midsection his skin was missing and his flesh was slowly bubbling up and melting away. 

With a groan, he looked up at me and said, You need to get out. I didnt want to die. I ran here to escape, but. But. Fuck man. I dont know. My body started to feel like it was on fire. What the fuck are you still doing here? Get out. Get out!

I ran out and saw the deliverer standing in front of my door. She had a knife in her hand and stared at me with a small smile on her face. 

I raised my hands and turned my back towards her and leaned against the wall. She let out a short laugh and said, Follow me. I turned around and saw that she was walking towards her room. I ran up to her and tried to ask her what she was doing but she didnt say a single word back. When she got to her room she lied on her bed and said, I marked an X where my heart should be. I wanted to die on the bed I slept my whole life. With a million questions buzzing around my head, the only one I managed to ask was, Why? She shrugged and said, This is all I know. I was born into this like the other deliverers. We dont know who controls us. If I escaped I wouldnt know what to do. I dont have parents to go to. Why I chose you to survive? Well, that is because you are the only one who decided to sit with me. You are a pig when it comes to good food, but I enjoyed the momentary company. Its time. Do it now.

With a soft voice, I whispered, Thank you and plunged the knife into her heart. I stood next to her until she took her last breath. 

The doors are opened now. 

Before I head back into the world to live or be killed by whatever was leading this workforce I leave you this. 

Religion is a powerful thing. It can be used for something good or something beyond evil. We dont know which is which. The Bibles we made were not for some type of cult. They were for the churches around the Midwest. It was led by a pastor by the name of Drew Harris.

	<TEXT> For the last three years, I worked alongside forty other problem teens between the age of 12 to 17. 

How did I get here? 

I was fourteen and I was caught with a joint in my pocket. It was going to be the day I tried smoking weed for the first time with my friend. 

I was only suspended for a week, but my parents were very religious. They consulted with their pastor, but the only suggestion he could give us was to take me into rehab. We didnt have money for that so my mother grabbed my arm and led me out of the church with my father walking closely behind her. While we were walking to our car in the parking lot a man ran up to my father and said, Rehab isnt the only way! Give me 10 minutes of your time. I promise it will be worth it. 

My father gave the man an awkward smile and started to get in his car when the man blurted out, Its free and we can guarantee that your son will come back as the man God meant for him to be. With a small grunt, my father got out of his car and started talking to the man. I tried pressing my ear up to the window to catch what they were saying, but after a couple of minutes of listening to muffled voices, my man walked away with a satisfied grin on his face. When my father got into the car he said, Aaron, you are gonna have to pack up your stuff up tonight. They are picking you up at 4 in the morning. 

I kept asking him who was picking me up, how long I was going to be gone for, where I was going, but he did not say a single word to me. 

After three years of being in this fucking hellhole, I still dont know why Im here. 

I am not any better person of a person. We dont do anything that benefits our life. I do the same thing every single day. At 6 am I wake up and wake up my elder before I rush to the dining hall. If Im lucky I will be able to eat the same breakfast every single morning, eggs and a piece of toast. After breakfast, we clean our dishes and walk to Truth Hall and spend the next 12 hours flipping through Bible after Bible making sure imperfections were not found. After we inspect each Bible we would put a tiny mark on the bottom right corner of each page. 

Elders are people that turn 18 while they are here. They dont work, but they get punished every time we make a mistake with our inspections. 

Punishment is a little different here. The elder gets nailed to a cross and placed in the middle of the dining room. Everyone else grabs a rock from a pile provided by our Deliverers. As soon as we all pick up a rock we have to throw it as hard as we can at the elder until he dies. If we run out of rocks and the elder is still breathing then another elder gets crucified next to him. The most we had at one time was three elders ascended in the middle of the dining room. 

This morning I woke up a little earlier than everyone else. I got dressed into my outfit, a simple white shirt, white sweatpants, and brown leather sandals. After getting dressed I woke up my elder and ran towards the dining room. When I ran through the doors into the dining room I saw a deliverer sitting at the table alone. I wasnt scared of them because they were the ones that monitored us, punished the elders, and worked for whatever was holding us hostage. I was scared about how they always kept their faces covered with a white mask with the word sinner written in red on the top of the hat. It was also how they laughed whenever we were forced to kill our elders for what something that isnt even their mistake, but the scariest thing about them was how they communicated with each other. It was in a sort of low guttural sound I could not figure out, but whatever it was, it sent chills throughout my body when I heard them speak to each other. 

I tried to quietly walk past him, but he grabbed my arm and pointed at the seat in front of him. There was already a plate of bacon, eggs, sausage, and pancakes. I quickly sat down and stared at the food. My mouth was watering at the sight of good food, and I started to scarf the food as fast as I could into my mouth. Within 5 minutes I was staring at an empty plate of food. A chuckle came from within the mask, and the deliverer handed me its plate of food. I gratefully took it and ate the next plate of food a little slower. After I finished my food the others started to come into the hall. When I looked up to thank the deliverer I stared at an empty seat. 

The day went by normally until the end of my shift. When the bell rang, we all put down the Bible we were examining and went to the dining hall for dinner. I was the third to walk in, but before I walked through the doors I heard screaming. I ran inside and ran to the other two guys that were standing in front of the cross to find a deliverer lying on the ground. The first thing I noticed was that it was a man. As I walked up to him he turned to face me and I saw that the other side of his face was completely burned to a crisp. The eye was nothing more than a puddle of white and black liquid barely staying in place. The other side of his face was filled with words. I bent down and got a closer look at his face. 

They were words I was completely familiar with. 

Scriptures from the Bible.

He held his hand out towards me and started to wail out, *Lies. Lies. Its. Its all just lies. May God deliver you from the evil. May he grant you peace.*

Other deliverers quickly came into the dining hall after he went silent. They dragged him out and disappeared in the long dark hallway. By the time we were done with dinner we saw other deliverers getting dragged into the same hallway.  

The last deliverer was dragged on his stomach and I threw up into my plate of food as soon as I saw its backbone sticking straight up. Strips of meat hung from the bone and the flesh that was around the backbone looked to be bitten off. 

I dont know what came over me, but I ran out of the dining room and started running towards my room when I ran right into a deliverer. When I got up it grabbed my arm and pointed towards the hall the deliverers slept in. I followed the deliverer to an open room and sat down. When I sat down on a chair the deliverer took off his mask and grinned at me. 

A woman was staring at me. She had a face that belonged to an angel, but it was covered by the word Mary on her forehead and several verses of scripture written all over her face. 

When I gained the courage, I looked at her and asked her if she could help me escape. With a sad look on her face, she shook her head and softly said, No. With slight frustration, I asked her, Why? Why cant you help me leave? With tears running down her face she said, I dont know where we are. None of us do. If we dont do as they say we lose our life like you guys do. We arent any higher up than you. We just gain certain perks.

We were silent before I asked her, Do you have anything that can get on the internet? She nodded yes and handed me a laptop from underneath her bed. Before she handed it to me she said, We have tried to get people to track our location, but every single time someone from the outside gets a location they go to the spot only to find out that its useless. This place is untraceable. 

Im writing to you guys for help. Please dont try to find us. Its useless. Just give us suggestions. We need to escape before we all [lose our lives] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).
