	<TEXT> Ahh. Well i had bad form on my squat and deadlift to start out. I decided to go way down to work on form and have just progressed from there. I started squat at 115lbs and deadlift at 135lbs. I really went slow with progression because I want to make sure my form is good. No one cares if you can squat 315 if you're form is shitty.

Also I have bad knees so I take it slow for that also. </TEXT>

Sometimes they don't want me to touch the bar unless they are almost about to die and sometimes they want help at the first sign of failing. Depends on who you help. I would ask them what they want you to do.

If the person has no preference then I'll usually just stand behind them if they are doing good. If they struggle I'll begin to put myself in position to help and when they start to fail I will actually help them finish the lift. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello /r/hockey,

With the offseason about halfway over I thought it would be fun to create a poll where you can submit a player from each position (C, LW, RW, D, G) that you believe is the most underrated, or does not get enough attention for what they do.

Poll: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_YlckgmquaTB4W1aMQQRlLTeAIR333B2ngxW0BTjEZg/viewform?usp=send_form

What I have just posted is a link to the poll. Please fill in one name per position and please only submit the poll once. Only serious answers will be counted.

After about a week I will collect the data and then do a write up of the position and player, in order to give a little background about their accomplishments.

Hopefully this will help us become more aware of these players and watch out for them this upcoming season.

Edit: Please upvote for visibility (self-post=no karma). If there are not enough responses I cannot continue with the write-ups.  </TEXT>

One more question if you don't mind. I know that taking creatine will cause in increase in water retention and cause some water weight gain. Once I get more used to taking it will the retention slowly go down, or will I always be prone to retaining more water as long as I take creatine? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been reading up on creatine the last few days and decided it would be beneficial for me to take.

The only thing is, is that everyone says 5g a day, everyday. I am fine with that. But the C4 I use has 1g of creatine nitrate. Will taking 6g a day (1g from C4, 5g from creatine supplement) be okay? Or are the creatine in them different (creatine nitrate and creatine monohydrate)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The people at my gym I swear. Go to the gym on Sunday, some guy is curling in the squat rack. Luckily he left before I finished stretching so I was able to still use it no problem.

Yesterday, the same goddamn guy is curling in the squat rack again. He is still going by the time I finish warming up so I'm forced to use the shitty other one that barely lets me hit parallel because the saftey bars are too high. Whatever, do my squats its all good. Not as angry.

Couple exercises later I'm still using the rack, other guy comes up to me and asks if I'm done. Tell him I have two more exercises but I can move to the other rack after this one. Finish up, let him take over, chat for a bit and all is good. Start setting up next exercise and then see him proceed to start doing curls....

I had given him access to gains, and he betrayed my trust. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My suggestion would be ICF, the cutting version. It is 3x5 for compound lifts and 2x8 for accessories. You also only progress every other workout. I am currently doing it and love it. Once you get past the compound lifts the accessories are really not that bad. It a high amount of exercise for a beginner but more volume will help you gain muscle and burn the fat off.

Gaining muscle is not a bad thing, yes you will gain some weight from growing muscle but you won't look fatter, you will look fitter. As long as you eat at a caloric deficit you will lose fat. Doing a novice program will help you increase muscle and make you looked more toned out. If you don't do some sort of strength training program you run the risk of becoming skinny-fat. Also due to what you said about your lifting numbers you can gain muscle, it is called noob-gains. It only last 2-6 months, but they are gains nonetheless. Follow ICF guidelines and you'll be getting stronger in no time.

I highly suggest using the search function and reading up on novice programs and learning how to track and count calories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You said you were looking at PPL, but I'd check out PHUl as well. I was doing it for most of the summer and really enjoyed it. You have the time to do it and even the power days include a bit of hypertrophy. It is also easy to mix and match exercises to fit your likes and needs without straying to far from the original routine. 

Unfortunately had to stop because my lifts, which are already beginner level, were slowly decreasing and I needed to switch to a more strength-based program. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like others have said I think it's preference.

I used to use the ez-curl but for some reason it put a strain on my wrists so I switched to barbell and like it more. I didn't really seem to see a gain or decrease in production though as I switched.

I would say whatever is comfortable. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ice Cream Fitness(Cutting Version) Lifting #'s to start out. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-02 00:06:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Next week I will be starting ICF, the cutting version, once I get back into my gym. I would like some advice on my numbers I have choosen to start out with.

Stats: M/19/5'9/160/~20%BF

My current 5RMs are:

Bench: 145lbs

Squat: 165lbs

Deadlift: 185lbs

Bent-Over Row: 155lbs

OHP: 85lbs

For starting out I have figured to do around 75% of my 5RM as my lifts. My numbers will essentially look like:

Bench: 105lbs

Squat: 125lbs

Deadlift: 135lbs

Bent-Over Row: 115lbs

OHP: 65lbs

I will be adding 5lbs every workout to squats, 5lbs every other workout for bench, row and OHP and 10lbs every workout for deadlifts.

As for accessory work, I am deloading about 10% to start out and adding either 5lbs or 10lbs every other workout depending on the exercise.

Is this a good starting point for me or should I consider going lower?

I am currently on a cut and am starting a linear program (either SL5x5 or ICF) next Monday!

My current lifts are(5RM):

Bench: 145lbs

Squat: 165lbs

Deadlift: 185lbs

OHP: 85lbs

Bent-Over Row: 155lbs

Looking for someone around the same lifts, or even maybe a little stronger to push me harder!

I am competitive by nature and would love someone to share progress with as my fitness journey had pretty much just been me. </TEXT>

Unfortunately I am getting my wisdom teeth out today, and also small plate removed from my jaw when I broke it about 4 years ago. Recovery time is supposed to be 4-6 days, which means no gym until Monday. Also the worst part, no solid food either! But on the bright side I'll lose a good amount of weight and be closer to my goal, which is nice.

Anyone have any good smoothie recipes? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So after 8 weeks of PHUL on a cut, it is getting to a point where I have begun to stall on all my lifts.

My numbers are pretty beginner (All 5 rep maxes):

BP: 155lbs

OP: 80lbs

Squat: 175lbs

Deadlift: 185lbs

Bent-Over Row: 145lbs

But I wouldn't consider myself a brand-new lifter/beginner. I guess I would classify in somewhere inbetween beginner and intermediate. I played lacrosse my first 2 years of college and thus have knowledge of lifting and working out from team lifts and trainers. The problem I encountered was that my lifts were even worse when first played, so I was always embarrassed to lift in front of teammates and thus never gained strength.

My question is, should I do a beginner program (looking at SL5x5) because of my numbers, or should I try some sort of intermediate program.

I am still looking to be on a cut for the time-being if that helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The question that haunts all us males...how do I talk to my girlfriend about fitness?

She is trying to get fit but is lacking a lot of knowledge that could help. She doesn't know about calorie deficit, her diet is not the best (healthy, but with many treats intertwined) and she doesn't quite understand you can't target specific fat. 

Her diet is basically low-carb, she barely eats them. But she'll have ice cream with her friends a few times a week and eat a lot of fatty foods like red meat and cheese. I don't know how to convey that if she changes her diet it will work much better.

I have given her some of the things I've learned here but it isn't much. Don't get me wrong she has made progress but as much as she could. I believe explaining a lot of the things I've learned here will help her tremendously. Of course weight loss is a touchy subject and I don't want to hurt her by saying the wrong thing or getting into a fight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off we have around the same TDEE. I personally am at 1700cal instead of 1900 but thats just me. Work with your diet and meals. You can always change your calorie intake and you should once you start losing weight. If you feel like you are eating too much or cant hit your macros go down a little.

As far as running I am not sure. You could google "how many calories you burn in a mile at x pace" or just run to your hearts content. Personally I would give serious thought into a lifting program as well. You're BF% isn't high at all (which is what you should take note of instead of BMI) and the more muscle you have, the harder your body works to preserve it which means more calories burned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Losing weight means eating at a calorie deficit (calories in  amp;lt; calories out). To find that you need to find your TDEE then minus about 500-700. A quick google search should bring you to plenty of TDEE calculators you can use. Remember, diet+exercise  diet  exercise. Diet is the most important part of losing weight.

If you are new to the gym and lifting you will see muscle gain (noob gains). Even on a diet it is possible to build muscle, you won't build a lot but it will be there. The wiki has a ton of great starter programs you can use. For cardio there are a ton of options out there. Find one or a few you like and stick to it. Doing something you don't enjoy won't help your goals

It isn't possible to target fat though. Fat loss is fat loss is fat loss. Some places are harder than others to lose fat. Unfortunately the stomach seems to be one of them. Don't be discouraged. What I do is weigh myself once a week and take progress pics. If I am feeling down I just look back at all that I've done and it motivates me more. It'll take time and hard work but if you really want to get fit, you won't give up. Hope this all helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I've been cutting for 7 weeks and am currently down 15lbs (178 to 163). Also I am 5'10.

I tried PPL but do not have enough time to dedicate 6 days to the gym. I enjoy the PHUL routine and have seen progress from the workouts, I adjusted my hypertrophy days to be a little more power based so that way I can gain strength. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello!

I did a seperate post a few days ago on my routine. I am currently cutting for the summer and most likely for the next few months after. Goal is to lose fat and gain/maintain muscle strength.

Stats: M/166lbs/~22% BF

Here is a full post with many details about my routine and diet. It did not get a ton of attention so I would like to post it here for extra critique.

	<TEXT> I started at 178lbs. Currently 166lbs.

The problem was the first 3 weeks I was doing a bodybuilding.com workout that was a complete waste of time. I actually started decreasing in my lifts so I had to switch. I lost a lot of fat and water weight at that time though because it had me running 4 times a week. I switched to a PHUL routine in week 4 and have experienced many gains. I've definitely built muscle which is why I am currently plateauing at around 166 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah im currently 7 weeks in but held a ton of water weight and excess fat and I also had stopped lifting for about 2 months so any progress I made was gone. I'm just now starting to see gains and definition. Mostly noob gains that are already slowing so this is the real push I need to make.

Long term I'm looking to shed as much BF and have a lot of lean muscle then hopefully in a year start a monster bulk. But for the near future its all about getting lean </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats awesome man! I am no where near where I want to be so I really won't be stopping this cut anytime soon. Once you have access to a gym it seems like we'd be good for motivating and pushing each other </TEXT>
