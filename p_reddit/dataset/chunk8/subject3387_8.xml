	<TEXT> Yep. My place just outside Hiroshima was 400 a month and had two bedrooms and a separate kitchen/sitting room. It was a little old and a train ride to the city, but it was a good place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A strange how everybody has the same experience of morphing into inanimate of objects. On this thread alone there's a plank of wood, a fence, a piece of carpet, and Beyonc's birth certificate. 
To add to this, I had three friends who did it one night. One became a kit kat wrapper, one a cabinet, and the other became the inside of a tyre. 

Most scarily of all, one of those friends took it again a week later, and in the brief period he was out of it, he said he experienced a whole week of his life. Totally mundane stuff, just getting up, doing chores, going to work, coming home, eating, meeting friends, etc. On the final day, he met that female presence who explained he'd be ok, and he kinda came to. After hearing that, I decided to put Salvia on my small but growing "nope" list.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To add, in high fat diets (i.e. cheese) the liver breaks down bacteria in the foods to form end products called lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which increase cholesterol in the coronary system and fatty deposits in the liver. However, some fungal or mold based cheeses have compounds which combat these bacteria before they reach the liver and form the dangerous LPS. Again, saving the French from heart disease.

Glad I could help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Biological scientist here with an interest in diet and nutrition. Also my supervisor during my thesis was French and we talked at length about this paradox. Basically the paradox is that there is low incident of coronary disease despite the large a amounts of fatty dairy products consumed.

Yes the French eat more cheese than any other nation. But they also show portion control and eat a lot of fruit and vegetables. 

Also, as mentioned, the cheese is enjoyed as cheese rather than as a full pizza for example.  Research has also shown cheese to decrease inflammation in the body and also inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which increases blood pressure. 

Then we have resveratrol - a compound found in red wine and grapes which acts as an antioxidant and exhibits cardioprotective qualities. It basically prevents the oxidation of LDL Cholesterol  (bad fat) which leads to heart disease. And as we know, the French love their red wine.

Just some food for thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Outside of the US, "yank" refers to anybody from the US. Though I have some great American friends, the US and it's people are often mocked as being the world's narky teenager, or loud and stupid here in Ireland too. 

To add to the original point, Irish people also are extremely offended when we are referred to as "British". We are an independent state not even located on the island of Britain (Scotland, England, Wales.) </TEXT>

As above! Just read the terms. The 15 euro is credited to you after your next check-out. So I guess 15 euro of your second next booking.  </TEXT>

Apologies is this in an inappropriate place to post but I'm uncertain where to post.

Just got this in my account after booking a hotel for a holiday in Amsterdam. If you book the accommodation for your next trip through this link, you'll get  15 off.  Limited to 10 people. First come first serve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I asked my friend what evidence would convince him it's round. He wants to see video footage of a rocket being sent into space, from ground to orbit, single continuous shot, no cuts, preferably amateur. 

If anybody knows of a video like this, you'd be doing the world a service by converting somebody to science and rationality. </TEXT>
