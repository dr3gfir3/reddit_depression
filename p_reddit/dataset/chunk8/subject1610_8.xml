	<TEXT> Between the screenwriter's draft and the finished product, the script changes a LOT, based on the input of the studio/producer/director/editor/etc. 

So in the final movie, it's impossible to tell what parts the screenwriter wrote originally, and what parts were inserted somewhere along the line.

A movie's story is not the product of one person, so the blame can't fall one person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me personally:

- **Mood** -- That's what *Lore* is very good at: atmosphere, ambient music, etc. 

- **Get to the point** -- I like it when it's clear the episode has a direction. There was one episode of *Lore* that began with Aaron discussing his passion for the show *MacGyver*, and eventually the episode arrived at its true focus: goblins. But looking at those two topics, can you tell how one leads to the other? I was listening to the MacGyver talk and thinking, *What does this have to do with anything?* And if your audience is thinking that, then something's wrong. 

- **Have a story to tell** -- When the episode is just a string of facts, it's not terribly interesting, because it feels like someone reading a textbook. But if the episode unfolds like a story (i.e. question/conflict, escalation, climax, resolution), then I'm hooked. Two episodes of *99% Invisible* are the perfect example of this: "Structural Integrity" and "The Grand Dame of Broad Street". [*Lore* can't always accomplish this, because each episode is not just about one thing; it's about a lot of things.]

Or did you mean what kinds of topics? As long as there's a neat story to tell, I'll listen to anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Burying the lead. 

I should really love the podcast *Lore* -- it's right up my alley. But Aaron Mahnke drapes the information in this theatrical language, focusing less on what's being said, and more on *how* it's being said. It sounds like narration from a movie trailer.

Take the episode descriptions, for example: 

*We spend every waking moment surrounded by people. People who talk to us, who interact with us, and who are very much alive an breathing. Which is why its that much more shocking when we stumble upon those who arent. And its more common than youd think.*

I have no idea what that episode is about.

The first five seconds of a YouTube ad are unskippable, so trailers have started using those five seconds as a hook to keep you watching (and dissuade you from hitting the "SKIP" button once it shows up).

Case in point: you'll never see a trailer-before-the-trailer in the movie theater. Only on YouTube. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Internet fandom has this weird attitude where something isn't clever unless it connects to two or three things that came before it. Like the most important thing isn't storytelling -- it's brand recognition.

If the internet ran a movie studio, the movies would have no story, no character, just references and in-jokes and winks and nods and meta.

- Virgins live, sluts die.

More writing related:

- Horror movies need something to do -- you shouldn't just write a bunch of bumps in the night. If the haunted house/ghost/demon/slasher/etc demonstrates as much *influence* as an actual character, then it needs as much *drive* as an actual character. 

- I read a lot of scripts where the protagonist are given mountains of characterization in the first act -- but then once the monster arrives, all that characterization is abandoned in favor of the simple fight for survival. Why should I care that Jenny is flirting with Mike, or Rachel hates her new job, if it's not gonna matter once the killer shows up? Characterization isn't a placeholder, and protagonists aren't meat bags waiting to be stabbed. 

I don't know if that's what you're asking for, but hey, there it is.

What do you mean by 'universal truths'? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cellulose nitrate dice, the industry standard until the middle of the twentieth century, typically remain stable for decades. Then, in a flash, they can dramatically decompose. The crystallization begins on the corners and then spreads to the edges. Nitric acid is released in a process called outgassing. The dice cleave, crumble, and then implode.  Ricky Jay

Granted, I'm guessing these are cellulose acetate, rather than cellulose nitrate, but the crystallization is still the same.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually think *John Wick* fails the *show don't tell* advice, when it comes to John Wick himself. 

A lot of John's characterization comes from other people, who call him a badass. We're **told** he is an unstoppable killing machine, we're **told** he is the boogeyman, we're **told** about the mysterious, incredible things he did in the past -- but what we're **shown** in practice is (frankly) just an Action Hero. 

A very well-choreographed Action Hero, but still an Action Hero.

And there's one moment that defies that, and it's one of the best moments in the movie: Viggo hears John Wick is involved, says "Oh," and quickly hangs up. That one single action delivers a mountain of characterization. That moment says more about John, than all the boogeyman talk put together. That is showing, not telling. </TEXT>

Paul Newman and Steve McQueen both wanted top billing, so a compromise was reached: McQueen's name would technically be first (when read left to right), but Newman's name would be a little higher, resulting in the roller coaster of names you see there.

	<TEXT>  If you look at /u/subject1610's reader graphic, of the 300 or so scripts he covered that he used the stats from, 49 were horror. Less than half that many were drama.

I feel like I should point out that a lot of those 300 scripts were for a company that made a lot of horror films, and became associated with them, and probably sought them out. So the genre distribution may not be reflective of the industry as a whole.

John August and Craig Mazin were even surprised to see that the horror numbers were that high, when they reviewed that infographic on Scriptnotes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Script reader here. 

I honestly don't think there's one particular genre that's harder than the rest. I'm mentally running through the scripts I've read, and there are shitty scripts everywhere. There's no shortage of ways to mess up a story, no matter the genre. 

- **Horror** - Putting the horror above the story, and letting the plot gather dust while you cram all your jump scares in, killing off side characters and only approaching the protagonists in the last thirty pages.

- **Sci-fi** - Valuing originality of world over originality of characters/plot; adding as many sci-fi elements as you can without putting them to use in a story, and turning the script into a product showcase, rather a narrative.

- **Action** - Making your protagonists unstoppable, gruff, robotic Action Heroes who never miss a punch and never lose the upper hand; a script that is trying so hard to be *Badass!* that it's forgetting to make its story believable, engaging, or exciting. [The first version of *John Wick* I read had that problem in spades]

If I had to pick one, I might say comedies are hardest, because comedy is so subjective, and people's senses of humor are so different. Which means that you can do everything right -- but all it takes is a reader with a different sense of humor, and suddenly you've failed.  </TEXT>
