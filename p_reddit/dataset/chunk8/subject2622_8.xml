	<TEXT> There's nothing wrong with religion. Some people take comfort in thinking that there is something beyond this life.  It can be a scary thing to try to imagine not existing anymore and to accept that death is the end. Some people need to have that hope.

Don't treat her like she's stupid for having faith. Just explain that it's a personal choice and you haven't seen the evidence required for you to believe. </TEXT>

If you've ever been to a pro sporting event, then you know that most seats aren't made for normal sized people. His leg kept touching mine and he kept apologizing. I'm a really chill and goofy guy, so the third time he apologized, I turned to him and said "It's cool, man. To be honest, I've never felt so close to a complete stranger before."
We spent the rest of the game talking about different stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article on snopes is irrelevant in this situation. 
Because, It only covers the idea that the sugar will turn into liquid cement not the effects of unfiltered sugar gas on an engine and/or carburetor..

This was the 70's, which means that the technology wasn't as sophisticated and the vehicle was carbureted. Less sophisticated filtration coupled with the fragile nature of carburetors when met with even small pieces of dirt would cause a pretty fucked up car.  Not knowing the cause would also lead to someone saying "My car is ruined."

I'm not sure it's legal to possess them in the United States, but that's a place you can get them. I'm sure they'd give you a deal on multiple purchases too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sounds like special education class.  You could offer it up as an elective, but very few people would take it. I believe there is too much of a stigma attached to seeking help for such things. Most kids that need it would be victims of bullying already and too scared to get involved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is no such thing as "nice" in her mind. If you attempt to be nice in that sort of way, she'll assume you want something from her. Once you assure her that you're not out for anything in order to make her comfortable enough to go to the dance with you, it becomes impossible to escalate the relationship to romance because you've made it clear (to her) that you don't want anything from her. Thus landing yourself in the much debated "friend zone"... 

I used to be that guy :/    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It makes sense as an excuse. If you want to go out with your friends, but at the same time you don't, you'll have your chores as an excuse. Perhaps you don't want to have that as an excuse. Because honestly, those are really minor things that shouldn't keep you from going out, especially if you  typically only go out on weekends.

I understand the cons of going out on your own. It tends to suck, but things can't change unless you put yourself out there.  If you do decide to go out on your own, don't be afraid to post your plans to facebook or text some of your friends letting people know that they're welcome to join you but your plans aren't dependent on them. Make sure you follow through with it whether or not you'll be alone though. Don't ask them to join you. Tell them they're welcome to come along.

Dude, forget your ex.  Unless she's dead, she's having a ton of fun without you. If she died, I'd say that's your problem right there in which case you need to accept that she'd want you to be having fun.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do something different everyday. Mix shit up for yourself. You're on Reddit right now, go out and do something. You can't expect something unexpected when you don't have variables. The world is full of variables that you can add to your life. Go see a movie. Who cares if you're going by yourself. That gives you the freedom to talk to anyone you want. You're not obligated to hang out with or pay attention to any one person.

The world is yours. </TEXT>

My story is a collision in roller hockey where a skate got tangled in the crotch of my pants. I was wearing a cup, but it still felt like they were goners. My cup was cracked... The boys were mostly unharmed though.  </TEXT>
