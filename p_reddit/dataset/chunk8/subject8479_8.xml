	<TEXT> The mixing is solid. Also your choice on Synths. Maybe it's my headphones, but I feel like the Kick could be a bit louder and "kickier". </TEXT>

To vocals are currently being recorded.

One specific question: Is the arp playing in the drop okay from a sound design perspective?

	<TEXT> I believe it's a mainly motivational thing. You will be surprised how fast your sound improves, and that motivates you to learn even more. You just need to start at some point and trust in yourself in what you're doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started producing in 2011 and felt exactly the same a few months ago. I thought for the 5 years I am doing this I should be way better than I am. Then I just started forcing myself to learn about every single technical aspect I didnt understand. I gathered more knowledge in these (maybe 3) months than I did in the last 3 or 4 years. Its not like understanding these things is some magical secret. Its just about looking for information until you can comprehend the matter and using the knowledge you picked up in your new projects and experiment with what you get from it.


You already are in the right subreddit! Search for the keywords you mentioned above and just try to understand. If you dont, make a new post and point out whats confusing you.


A YouTube channel that helped me was [Composing Gloves](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0ahUKEwja0dbxupPPAhWMCsAKHZqEB6kQFggcMAA url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fcomposinggloves usg=AFQjCNE6rdHveAZR7Np_ijUBkLpgWE-Q5g bvm=bv.133053837,d.bGg). Check out his from the ground up-series.

Also, I read the [iZotope Mixing Guide](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0ahUKEwi5l6u5u5PPAhVlJMAKHRoKDyYQFggfMAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownloads.izotope.com%2Fguides%2FiZotope-Mixing-Guide-Principles-Tips-Techniques.pdf usg=AFQjCNFQMaoVfGNbifxyfWOyNtL843fe8g bvm=bv.133053837,d.bGg) which is a great resource for all mixing related questions.

I hope this helps you as a starting point and inspiration.

	<TEXT> Since I often have problems finding the right inspiration, I love to use a random vocal from looperman.com and start with that as a basis and build chords and rythm around it. Then I drop the vocal and replace it with whatever I think is missing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Plumfruit
I like your track, gives a good summer mood. However, I feel like there's some (sub)bass missing in the drop. A simple sidechained sine wave playing the chorus melody would help make it "dropier" and fuller. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. Solid track, but there's definitely some punch missing. Try using a compressor with a fast release on the drum (kick) and the pluck (the one at 2:52). </TEXT>
