	<TEXT> Got some slightly better pics. What do you think?
I feel like the head looks a little more defined as a separate part than a bb. But I'm also biased in that I don't want it to be a bb lol.

Edit: Also, the ass doesn't look quite as fat as a bb, maybe?

	<TEXT> Just looked up psocid. They do look pretty similar to bed bug nymphs. Going to look for a magnifying glass. Seems like psocid have a neck area whereas bb's don't. That should be the easiest way to differentiate the two.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bed bug nymphs shouldn't be able to crawl up climb ups right? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So, I was inspecting my climb ups and to my surprise I see what looks like tiny bed bug nymphs crawling around inside. Two of them. Casually walking about the inside wall without any difficulty at all. The wall part, not the bottom. The part they aren't supposed to be able to scale. I feel like maybe they aren't bed bugs but they awfully look like them. If they are they are like brand new babies unfed. Too small to get a decent picture unfortunately. What do you guys think? I feel like maybe they were a bit too energetic to be bb's. There is ciemexa everywhere and I haven't been able to find a live one in months. But I don't know what to think now.

	<TEXT> Hah, hell no. I got a nice metal frame that doesn't need the box springs. Equipped with climb ups and six inches away from the wall. 

As a random side note, nothing to do with BB's, if you ever meet a chick that has her mattress directly on the floor, take it as a giant red flag, they are always nutty.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bed Bug LPT: Time to embrace minimalism! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, a little bit of a different post here but a little variety can be nice. So, as my title suggests, if you have BB's, adapting a more minimalist life style is really beneficial. Pretty simply, the less crap you have the less places they can hide. I've thrown out dumpsters worth of stuff I never really needed in the first place and now my place feels cleaner, fresher, and makes me feel better mentally when I'm home. With the help up climb ups, cimexa, and routine inspections I've finally got these bastards on the ropes. 

I also spend about a half hour per day cleaning and or organizing random shit so my place always looks nice. After a very long infestation I haven't found any alive or dead in about a month. Oh, and I also repainted all my walls a nice light color because they were all darker colors so it makes inspections much easier and makes rooms feel bigger and more open. Also, make sure to invest in a good flashlight.. 

I got a bunch of tips on organizing from reading Marie Kondo. She has a bunch of videos on YouTube as well. There is also a pretty good podcast by two guys called the minimalists. 

That's all for now, stay vigilant killers!  </TEXT>
