	<TEXT> I think one way to get an answer for your question is look into the current job openings at companies like GE,Vestas, Siemens (for wind energy), First Solar, Solar City etc. (for solar), let us say Tesla (for storage). I personally find roughly 30% of these positions for project leaders/coordinators (they do ask for work experience in similar fields though), but it might help you make an informed decision. Recently I was checking the careers site for [NREL](https://nrel.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/NREL) which is the leading research institute for renewables right ? and not all jobs are for engineers. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Book Thief is full of paraprosdokians </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-19 00:43:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, I am half way through the book and observed that  death uses paraprosdokians (I am not fully sure if it is the right term) to perfection, I love his observations. An example:

"When death captures me, the boy vowed, he will feel my fist on his face. Personally I quite like that. Such stupid gallantry. Yes. I like that a lot."

What are your observations about the author's style, do any other writers resemble it ?

Little One don't be afraid of this big river,

Be safe in those warm arms forever,

Grow tall my child, be wise and strong,

But do not take from any man his song,

Little one, don't be afraid of this dark night,

Walk boldly as you see the truth and light,

Love well my child, laugh all day long,

But do not take from any man his song."

	<TEXT> Thanks, you are right to me, that made the characters real. That is how affairs and flings happen in real life, due to human weakness. I would rather see this kind of a movie than when people act larger than life. As for Eastwood's direction, you are entitled to call them garbage, I think I am a better person for having watched them and shall keep telling others the same. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What do you guys think about "The Bridges of Madison County (1995)" </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey Guys, just saw this movie. From now on, I'll always post this this when people talk of romantic movies. Sometimes there is a movie with nothing new in the story but the rest of its aspects are sublime. It is shot in the beautiful Iowa country side and is about a housewife and mother (Meryl Streep) who gives up her dreams for her family  and how she finds a love (Clint Eastwood) 'with a certainity that comes once in a lifetime'. Wow, Mr. Eastwood has directed some amazing movies. Another thing about the movie is it was made in 1995 and takes you back to 80s countryside. 1995 was some year for the movies - Braveheart, Toy Story, Seven, Apollo 13, 12 moneys, The Usual Suspects, Dead Man Walking, Babe, Leaving Las Vegas. If it was upto movie I would give all these movies an Oscar anyday. 

PS -I don't remember Clint playing any romantic roles really and there was this scene when Meryl asks him "What were you like when you were young ?" and he answers "Trouble." Yeah Well :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Guys, just saw this hilarious movie, I loved it. I did not understand why in the end Klara checks to ensure Klarik is not bow-legged. It thought everyone knew by then that Vadas was a phony and he spread lies about Kralik being bow-legged. I mean she got both the guys in one right, the letter writer and the guy she had a crush on. Is it just a comic ending or is it supposed to mean that she might have ditched Kralik, if he did turn out to be bow-legged. Thank you :) </TEXT>
