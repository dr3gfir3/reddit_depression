	<TEXT> One day my cat walked in front of me. Made noises to get my attention then pissed on the floor maintaining eye contact.  I jammed her face in it and then dumped my entire glass of water on her head.  Then she got an hour long bath.  She never did that again.  Not once.  You can't let ten pounds of furry asshole walk all over you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Felicity is back to being a supporting character.  Oliver is back to be CW Batman.  The action is really improved.  Hes using new trick arrows.  At one point he shot fucking fire out of his bow which was awesome as shit.  DOLPH LUNDGREN! The villain is damn close to nearing Slade Wilson levels of awesome sauce.  This entire season has been building to a finale that keeps looking better and better. 
And even though I fucking hate Curtis with every fiber of my being, the other sidekicks all turned out pretty great.  
  
And the best part of all, Olicity is fucking dead.  There's been one short scene dealing with that non-sense this entire season and even that was handled with care.  The majority of this season neither one really acts like they ever dated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FYI : FOX had no faith in Deadpool. They also were freaking out over Logan once they realised they couldn't take the R rating from them again.  Mangold filmed the movie as practically as possible specifically because FOX took the R rating from them on The Wolverine.  Hugh Jackman also had to pay for some of the movie himself.  
  
It needs to be made clear, FOX had NOTHING to do with the success of either of these films.  Deadpool was great because of Ryan Reynolds.  And Logan was great because James Mangold knew FOX would try and pull the same shit they did a few years ago.  Giving FOX credit for either of these films is like giving your dog a treat for shitting on your bed. </TEXT>

The scene at the end after the retarded fireball save, EVERYONE gets out of their car but The Rock.  
  
The crash at the beginning, they used a stand in for Vin Diesel you only see the back of his head.  There wasn't even a closeup of Vin in that scene, which is fuckng odd considering it was a big moment and hes the star of the film.  
  
The BBQ at the end there's another shot of Vin from behind that honestly looked added in with CGI. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Years ago I was learning to drive and my dad was very stubborn about a hamburger joint by our house. They always screwed up the order after 9pm, and he always wanted to go there after 9pm.  So I drove to Braum's and we said very clearly that we wanted two burgers and fries with no mayo.  We made them repeat it.  We pay and I start driving to the road when my dad screams "MOTHER FUCKING MAYONNAISE!" and jumps out of the moving car.  I just had a learner's permit so seeing my dad leap out of a moving car was startling.  He starts storming off inside the restaurant and I go and park.  As I park I see him throw the bag of food at the wall and start throwing his arms up and down like a crazy person.  When I went in the place it was dead silent, all the employees were off in a corner hiding and the manager was making new food. It honestly felt like he was robbing the place.  Never seen such a stunned silence before.  It was so quiet you could hear the grill. We kept going there after 9pm and after this day they never screwed the order up again. </TEXT>

I couldn't sleep the night I saw it, kept thinking about the ramifications of that world.  I wouldn't recommend watching that one first, its highly regarded as the best of the series.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your headphones are haunted.  This is what you do.  
  
Step 1 : Dig a hole in the backyard of your house.  It needs to be exactly 5 feet from the home.  
Step 2 : Cover the hole in salt.  It needs to be white.  
Step 3 : While playing "Black Sabbath : War Pigs" on the loudest speaks available too you.  Put the headphones in the hole.  
Step 4 : Before the song is over, cover the hole with dirt and piss on it.  
  
After five days the headphones should be fine.  Just pull them out of the ground and enjoy. Oh and if the headphones are from Turtle Beach you need to play "Britney Spears : Work Bitch" instead of War Pigs.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The star of the show said hes back.  That means hes back on the show.  There's no doubt.  There's no what if.  It's happening.  Contracts and schedules were worked out months before this announcement. 
  
And do you know how I know that?  [Definitive proof.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CtTrJ-2W8AAYcYT.jpg)  This was posted this year by Stephen Amell.  There was no mention of Manu Bennett.  Not once.  He didn't voice him in episode 8.  He wasn't on set.  Now Deathstroke is being used again and its different, this time he called out Manu by name.  Thats not a coincidence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats why im thinking hes not Eggsy's counterpart.  Makes more sense if he was more in a Firth's position. I could be wrong though, who knows?  There's not even a trailer yet. </TEXT>
