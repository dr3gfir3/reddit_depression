	<TEXT> I dunno why but I have this weird feeling that he's going to do something really unexpected. Just thinking about how Conor works, he loves to prove people wrong. With all the talk about how he 'cant make 145 anymore' I have this sick sense that that's exactly what he's gonna do. 

I mean it's totally up in the air, but I would imagine his next fight will HAVE to be a title defense. Despite what Dana has been saying, I can't see him giving up a belt, or Dana making him. Think about it. Say he vacates the featherweight belt, all featherweight fights are basically relegated to the pre-lims. Aldo is most likely retired, no one actually beat the new champ, who honestly gives a shit? I don't see Dana doing that. I think he'll allow Conor to keep both under the condition that he defends them both at least twice in 2017 or something like that. That's just my feeling. 

As for who, I think Aldo is out of the picture honestly. McGregor v Edgar is the only featherweight defense that makes any sense. Lightweight it's gotta be Khabib, right? Especially after all the shit that's gone on. Nate 3 is tantalizing but I think the lightweight division would fucking strike or something if Nate skipped the queue; that would just be a middle finger to everyone there.

	<TEXT> That he hasnt defended the featherweight belt is a fair criticism for sure. And i guess going forward his next fight will probably have to be a defense of one of the belts. But I disagree about edgar being a grevious omission. Did you see edgar/aldo at 200? That was embarrassing. Edgar looked like a schoolboy trying to fight someones older brother in the schoolyard. Conor would tower over him and reach wise edgar wouldnt get close. Like, he beat the best in the division. Unbeaten champ for ten years. Slept in 13 seconds. Thats enough of a statement for me. 

BUT that criticism absolutely holds water now in the lightweight division. He DID skip the queue here. Thats impossible to deny. So we'll see what happens next.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, literally every time conor fights, his opponent is touted as "the answer" to his dominance. 

Talk of mendes pre-fight: 
- amazing wrestler. Nightmare match up for conor. 
Result: 2nd round ko. 

Talk of aldo pre-fight: 
- different beast. Pound for pound best in the world. A nightmare for conor. 
Result: 1st round ko in 13 seconds, fastest title acquisition in ufc history. 

Loses to diaz, owns the loss. 

Talk of diaz pre-fight 2: 
- too much for conor. Outclassed on the ground. 
Result: win by decision, scored 3 knock-downs, defended all but one takedown attempts.  

Talk of alvarez pre-fight: 
- different beast. Nightmare for conor. 
Result: 2nd round - practically effortless - ko. First ufc dual weight champion. 

Im genuinely curious, what exactly WILL it take for people to stop talking shit? Conors persona elicits and invites hyperbole, but the evidence that he is as good as he says vastly outweighs the evidence that he isnt. And yet this cycle is ALREADY starting up again with talk of Khabib being "a nightmare" for conor. 

So honestly, what would it take to shut people up? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is very likely. Japanese people learn english (in japan. Obviously this doesnt apply to japanese people like shuri, raised abroad) through katakana, their loan-word alphabet, sonically identical to their hiragana alphabet. So unless they actively pursue english study, they end up speaking in that heavy syllabic way and more often than not cant understand native pronunciation even for words they know. 

As an example, when I first moved here i went to starbucks and asked for a vanilla latte. Met with blank confusion. When i adjusted to "banira rateh" she got it immediately. 

It took a long time for me to be comfortable speaking english like that without feeling like some sort of racist lol
