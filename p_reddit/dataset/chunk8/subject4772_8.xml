	<TEXT> This is soo sad, There are always those people that feel the need to think everyone should live by a set of unwritten rules. I know people that have "fulfilling" lives and don't look happy at all.... One of my close friends got married at 22, has a fulltime job and raising a kid to keep him busy.

I get to play video games, work my casual job with like 4 days a week off, have fun and play/mod nerf guns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was removing the AR in a nerf element using a hobby tool... as I broke through the plastic support it slid extra and cut inside the tube.

The result is a deep cut, feels as you'd expect slicing plastic heavily with a hobby knife in one go.

So, is this going to be an issue for the O-Ring? if so, are there any solutions for me to try? i'm kinds tempted to sand there.

Since the nrl made changes to take the wrestle out of the game it feels like our coaches (trent robinson might of kickstarted it) adapted to the faster game with short passing and getting the ball to the backrowers and supporting them. </TEXT>
