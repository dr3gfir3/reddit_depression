	<TEXT> The Walking Dead has made millions. Comics, video games, spin-offs, you name it. You guys know that Season 7 will have a huge opening as usual. Why, then, was it necessary to end season 6 with a cliffhanger? And please Robert don't use the "this is the end of this story" or "the start of that story" card. Your fans are more intelligent than that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There once was this king who would call in a different Jester every night. Drunk with wine, he would nonchalantly look on the show that the hapless Jesters spent months in advance preparing. But Jesters feared entertaining this King, for once the show was over, he would clap his hands twice and a pair of guards would escort the Jesters away, never to be seen or heard from again. 

This particular Jester swore that he would put on the best show that any King has witnessed. A spectacle for the ages! He spent nearly two years preparing every part and detail of this great endeavor. Finally  the fated day arrived, and this Jester impressed the King (or tried to) with this great spectacle, and every noble at the end cheered and clapped their delight. But the King remained silent, watching the Jester with cold eyes and a hard frown.  Finally the King raised his hands, clapped once...then clapped again. 

The guards took the Jerster away. They did unspeakable things to him.
