People don't seem to realize that if you're allergic to something, generally you aren't exposed to it much in your life and therefore don't walk around craving it all the time like them.

	<TEXT> I get weird reactions from people for being allergic to eggs and nuts. Sometimes people will act like I'm making it up and basically one of those "gluten free" people, and I've had someone go on a rant about how people are weak these days and I should just stuff my face with cake until I'm not allergic to it anymore. I've also had people (completely seriously) say that if they were allergic to ____, life wouldn't be worth living. 

If you aren't exposed to a food from childhood you generally don't like it. The idea of sugary bready food like cake or doughnuts just grosses me out. I tried some once and it was disgusting. People don't seem to realize that people with allergies aren't just walking around craving the same things they do all the time and not being able to eat it. That's not how it works! </TEXT>

I'm growing it out right now and it's my natural hair color down to about my ears and the rest of it is bleach blonde. I can't dye it darker since it's too damaged and the color won't stick, and I can't cut it because I look terrible with short hair, so I'm pretty much stuck with it.

When I was 15 and taking drivers ed classes (right after my mom died) they forced us to watch all of these horrible depressing documentaries about people who died or worse in drunk driving accidents and this one about a lady whose face melted off in a car accident but she survived. I still have a terrible fear of driving and am extremely anxious whenever I'm behind the wheel. I can't wait for self-driving cars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know a (wealthy) former pastor in his 60s who voted for Trump only because "he's pro-life". He's very liberal otherwise and is a huge proponent of free college education and healthcare, and very outspokenly against the discrimination that's been happening towards muslims recently. But he voted for Trump anyways, only for that reason.

This question should really be "why do old people vote Republican", because that's where the main split is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's obviously not true, the oldest person alive at a given point in time is usually about 114 and it's almost always if not always a woman. The oldest recorded person ever made it an extra 8 years to 122 which is insane already. The longest lived men are significantly younger. Even if it was a woman claiming to be 137 it would be impossible, but especially considering that it's a man, there is absolutely 0 chance his claims are true. </TEXT>
