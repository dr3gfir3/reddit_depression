That could become difficult to satisfy.  No body politic is ever in complete agreement.  Do we need a 50% plus one mandate in a host country beforehand?

It might be easier to agree only to military engagement during internationally UN sanctioned actions.  After all, if a majority population is committing a genocide against a minority population, the 'host country' is hardly going to invite military interference... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting, you mean instead of a constitutional monarchy?

I have a running theory on this with /u/dmcg12 that rather than abolish the monarchy we should just make QEII our monarch in perpetuity, even after she is deceased, which would effectively end our monarchy, but retain our heritage. 

However, I do think having the PM be the head of the executive and simultaneously the head of the legislative bodies of Canada leads to inherent conflict of responsibility. So, I would also want some kind of reform to the office of the Governor General.  

That being said, I don't know if being a republic instead of a constitutional monarchy would really mean that much in the scheme of things for the future of Canada... </TEXT>

I would argue these are things we've already achieved, take for granted, and are in greater danger of losing, rather than a 'lofty goal' we're still seeking out.

 Considering the alacrity with which the rest of the world...

I don't think we should settle to measure ourselves against the rest of the world. I think at best the world is permanently in a state of at least mild turmoil.  Canada is insulated against most of it, and I think we should take that as an opportunity to achieve something greater for humanity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a lot of pride as a Canadian citizen in so many of the ideals our country has embraced: tolerance, multiculturalism, universal rights...

However, I can't help wondering, what's next for us?

Looking at the world as it exists today, what is something Canada is well-positioned to innovate and lead the rest of the world on?

There was a questionnaire posted recently to members of the Liberal party, and there was [some discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/2nopvn/does_a_quiz_recently_sent_out_by_the_liberal/) about whether the LPC was trying to craft some kind of election narrative for 2015.  Personally, I found the topics somewhat boring.  

I wondered if I was alone in wanting to feel more inspired by the direction of my country.  Is it enough that we live in a developed, moderate democracy, with high standard of living.  Or, should we collectively be more ambitious?

Personally, I feel like we should be doing more, though I feel at a bit of a loss for what that 'more' ought to be.  </TEXT>

Typically I would separate scientific funding from a public advocacy group for a social agenda.  After all, solid-state NMR is hardly an election issue, and scientific research is generally accepted as a public good, and generates important economic returns. Still, funding comes and funding goes.  If you follow that link you posted, and check [NMR in Canada](http://nmr900.ca/nmr_canada.html), you'll agree that there is are a lot NMR labs across Canada.  While a 900 is pretty sweet, and I would have loved to try it at some point, there is plenty of NMR research, even in solid-state, being conducted in several labs across the country.

I'll agree it is stupid to make the investment and then shut the facility down for pennies on the dollar. </TEXT>

I don't mean to come out on the side of slashing programs, but new programs are introduced all the time, they either become essential public goods and politically untenable to remove (universal healthcare), or they become expendable.  

You're right though, these programs start as a manifestation of political ideological will, and end more typically as a pragmatic fiscal decision.  Granted, in this case the fiscal decision is also ideological, but what isn't partially ideological in politics... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Are you serious? That's a terrible justification for a tax!

Yes, I am joking (and laughing, sorry), but you have to admit if you're going to unfairly tax a demographic, it might as well be the one that refuses to exercise political power.

 On a separate note, why do you call it a "privilege" not to vote

I would argue that everyone has the right to vote. However, living in a country like Canada, with laws, stability, checks and balances, such that not voting won't yield much in the way of consequences and therefore choosing not to vote is a priviledge.

 Question: do you think that low voter turnout is the problem or a symptom of the problem?

I don't know if I'd categorize it as a symptom. As I said, I think those who don't vote are exercising a privilege to be lazy and not register an opinion, even if that opinion is *none of the above*. I think lack of satisfaction with the options is just an excuse to remain uninformed and not take responsibility for unpopular electoral outcomes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  To me, remembrance Day becomes derailed when people wear the white poppy. The people who wear the white poppy or who support it are hijacking remembrance day and pushing a political agenda. Regardless of their intentions.

I don't disagree with you, but I'm equally concerned about how Remembrance Day itself can often be hijacked for political narratives to encourage nationalism and nostalgia through glorified representations of Canada in the early 20th century.  

 But if Nazi Germany cannot be considered evil then what can? Nazi Germany and their atrocious are the literal definition of evil.

While Nazi Germany is probably the best example of evil that the average person can call to mind.  I feel like it's too often an excuse to view the world in black and white.  The west and its allies were 'good guys' and axis powers were all 'bad guys'; when really we shook hands with the devil in Stalin and committed plenty of atrocities defeating the Germans and Japanese.  

Overall, the actions of the west and its allies were necessary and justified, but the narrative we subscribe to remembering these events is a little too forgiving.  Monstrosities were committed to defeat monsters.

As an adult, I can acknowledge that WWII was probably as bad or worse, than the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and its simply difference of media available that shifts how we choose to remember these events that we get to feel like 'good guys' for WWII.  

However, that 'good guys' narrative is too easily exploited even today to convince large electorates to take up violent international conflicts, such as when the US invaded Iraq, by portraying Saddam Hussein as a Hitler of the middle east, with ties to 9/11.

I'm comforted by some of the other descriptions ITT for how individuals focus on the terrible sacrifice of Canadians when they wear the poppy. That our hands are never clean, no matter how pure the intentions going in... </TEXT>

You know me so well. :)

If we were going to build a system of government from scratch with all the technology, information, and even political philosophy available today, I think it's unlikely we would settle on parliamentary democracy.  I would further extend this to our judicial institutions, and really any public institution.  

Still, I don't know if direct democracy would necessarily be the answer either.  Though it would be very interesting to have regular national referendums (coupled with convenient voting schemes) rather than relying on elected representatives to vote on our behalf.  We could even still have elected representatives to submit and debate legislation...

Something that concerns me is that the Ottawa shooter [attempted to get a passport](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-shooting-michael-zehaf-bibeau-wanted-libyan-passport-1.2811768), and the Quebec hit-and-run murderer had [his passport revoked](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/martin-couture-rouleau-hit-and-run-driver-arrested-by-rcmp-in-july-1.2807078).  Both were prevented from travelling. Both were known to police and wanted to leave the country, and only barring that committed acts of domestic terrorism.  

If the police had the foresight to prevent these men from traveling, is there some other intervention, currently outside the bounds of the law (not necessarily detention or incarceration), that might have prevented both incidents?

(and future incidents for that matter...)

However, in the interests of transparency, we could experiment with enacting policies of declassifying in shorter intervals.  You could have a media embedding program for instance, where reporters and the intelligence apparatus work in cooperation (and under the supervision of a judicial arbiter) to declassify and inform the public within 5 years (or by election cycle) of operations executed.

Also, from a slightly more pragmatic perspective, understanding how the global economy is shifting, and positioning Canada to benefit the most based on the best information and analysis of foreign nations and transnational conglomerates is also important. 

After all, fairly recently a [certain Canadian enterprise](http://business.financialpost.com/2014/10/01/snc-riadh-ben-aissa-pleads-guilty/) was committing illegal actions behind closed doors with the Gaddafis in Libya. (Presumably not in the best interests of the Canadian state).

I wouldn't condone us training agents to violate the sovereign laws of other nations and steal intellectual property, but having first-hand data and analysis of foreign economies and the activities of large corporations impacting the global economy is invaluable.

Like [Jack Hooper said](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2007/05/26/extop_spy_breaks_silence.html), *"we're going to a dance where every girl is ugly"*.  If we don't arm ourselves with knowledge against a planet of people with no interest in preserving our interests and way of life, we're going to have a bad time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  rigorous oversight program

I totally agree with this, though I do wonder whether a judicial court is the appropriate means to establish ethical practices.  It's certain an essential means of enforcing against breaches. However, I feel like as soon as you try to establish a system of rules, it will be imperfect, and loop-holes will begin to be exploited. 

I would prefer that beyond typical judicial checks, that the intelligence and diplomatic communities would establish codes of professional conduct, and bodies for peer oversight, similar to how engineers, doctors and other professional groups keep their members in check.

This might be a naive proposal, but I think it could be a simple and effective means to cultivate an appropriate culture for a future intelligence community.

Edit:  I propose this to occur **along with** parliamentary and judicial oversight, not in lieu of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's the very definition of moving the goalpost.

One could argue that democracy and the law itself are moving goal posts...

After all, if something becomes unpopular leading to protest, which leads to a change in gov't administration, and then a change in regulation, then maintaining a mandate even only locally to a public project is an important reality.

For me, the more interesting question goes back to Spock: 

*"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one."*  

So, if a government possesses a national mandate, but fails to secure a local mandate, like in the case of the bitumen pipelines, are they still secure in pressing ahead with development?

I suppose the answer depends on the strength of the national mandate.  A good example is probably when P.E. Trudeau enacted the NEP against Alberta. </TEXT>

Isn't [civil disobedience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience) (i.e. protest) by its definition a means to undermine laws or practices that are perceived as an injustice?

From wikipedia: *"Civil disobedience is the active, professed refusal to obey certain laws, demands, or commands of a government, or of an occupying international power."*

 Their influence no more undermines the law than unions, business associations, or any other organized group that pleads a case to government.

The law is a tangible piece of work that is meant to approximate a perfect legal contract of compromise between all groups in society as a whole.  Depending on the level of disparity between the actual law, and 'what it ought to be' for perceived social justice, is the foundation of public protest isn't it? </TEXT>

I'm inclined to agree.  I wonder if there is anything in the criminal code regarding actions taken outside of Canada, so international jurisdictions.  For instance, if it was made illegal to engage in militant and other activities with foreign organizations for purposes contrary to the will of the Canadian state, then there could be a standing warrant for his arrest issued... 

Under these circumstances, his passport could be rescinded, rather than simply stripping him and others like him of citizenship, which comes off as an unwillingness of us to clean up our own messes.  

Furthermore, for intelligence purposes, given appropriate intervention and leverage, some of these people make for potential assets for undermining ISIS from within. </TEXT>

*Poco a poco y tambin mucho a mucho
me sucedi la vida
y qu insignificante es este asunto:
estas venas llevaraon
sangre ma que pocas veces vi,
respire el aire de tantas regiones
sin guardarme una muestra de ninguno
y a fin de cuentas ya lo saben todos: 
nadie se lleva nada de su haber
y la vida fue un prstamo de huesos.
Lo bello fue aprender a no saciarse
de la tristeza ni de la alegra,
esperar el tal vez de una ltima gota,
pedir ms a la miel y a las tinieblas.*


**English Translation**:
*Little by little, and also in great leaps,
life happened to me,
and how insignificant this business is.
These veins carried
my blood, which I scarcely ever saw,
I breathed the air of so many places
without keeping a sample of any.
In the end, everyone is aware of this:
nobody keeps any of what he has,
and life is only a borrowing of bones.
The best thing was learning not to have too much
either of sorrow or of joy,
to hope for the chance of a last drop,
to ask more from honey and from twilight.*

The poem has more passages and offers a little more optimism to feeling like a life is more than insignificance, even if that means you have to crave experiences for your own self-gratification. </TEXT>

Generally speaking, there's a distinction between attacking the actions and policies of one's opponents (fair game), rather than attacking people and character (negative ads).

That being said, I saw Trudeau's speech at UW this past week, and an interesting thing happened. Justin made a slightly unfair criticism that immediately got a lot of applause from the students, but then immediately said to the crowd, "don't applaud that... partisan attack..." 

So, while he's campaigning and stumping and playing the game, I appreciate that he has a certain distaste for 'going negative' on his opponents.

	<TEXT> Haha, I don't know if I wouldn't call myself a schmoe either, but as an example of how you could work with Ebola material that is inherently non-dangerous.  There was this story from a few years back of a [guy trying to smuggle](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/winnipeg-researcher-charged-with-smuggling-ebola-material-into-u-s-1.774725) Ebola-related research samples out of Canada's Lv4 Lab in Winnipeg.  While the prospect was scary, it was determined that what he'd stolen could never be used for bioterrorism because:

 Dr. Frank Plummer, the scientific director of the Winnipeg lab, said the genetic material taken was not the full Ebola virus and does not pose a risk to the public.

As I understand it, and this is purely speculation on my part, for viruses that have a habit of mutating rapidly (HIV, ebola), or other viruses where a seasonal variant can be very different year to year (influenza): while their exterior structures will change a lot making it difficult for our immune systems to detect or remember them, sometimes they possess a common trait across their various mutations.  

[Seth Berkley](http://youtu.be/nncPtxLCPrE) gives a great TED talk here about modern vaccine technologies currently being commercialized.  In the talk he uses the analogy looking at influenza that it might be wearing different clothes season to season, but it's always wearing the same socks, and that's how a universal vaccine could be developed.   

So, live virus might be very important for some aspect of research related to making a universal ebola vaccine, but it might be easier to expedite treatments that target the characteristics that are subject to change (this is risky though, as you could end up with something completely ineffective...)

That being said, in that talk by Seth Berkley, he explains why it would never be possible to use a strategy like this for influenza with our current process involving making the vaccine in chicken eggs.  However, with the alternative process he describes, rapid virus-like particle (VLP) therapeutics might be possible.  The company Protein Sciences that make Flublok effectively do this for seasonal influenza.

All that being said, it sounds like there's been [some success](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-29076371) developing ebola vaccines since the first outbreak, so hopefully they can turn around human trials fairly quickly for it. </TEXT>

This article claims that I, Adrian Hill, have  launched a devastating attack on Big Pharm, accusing drugs giants including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Sanofi, Merck and Pfizer of failing to manufacture a vaccine, not because it was impossible, but because there was no business case. I did no such thing.
I simply explained to Mr Cooper what is widely known in the biomedical research and development community: that vaccine development is extremely expensive, usually takes a very long time and the market is dominated by some very large pharma companies. Because outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola are rare and unpredictable and, until now, have afflicted small numbers of people in very poor countries, it is widely understood that that is no business case for a private company to invest tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in vaccine development for such diseases. It may be the Independents view that this is a telling indictment of the global pharmaceutical industry, but it is not mine and I am unhappy that the first paragraph of this report wrongly attributes that view to me.
Developing drugs and vaccines for diseases of low-income countries is an enormous challenge but one where there has been substantial progress over the last decade. The problem, that this report presents as news, is not new to the large numbers of governments and agencies working to tackle this area, including many product development partnerships set up to try and develop and provide vaccines for neglected diseases. In most cases the solution involves more public and charitable foundation investment in early stage research and partnerships with industry for late stage product development.
While most of us would like to see even more industry engagement in these endeavours one should also acknowledge the important contributions made by several major pharma companies despite the lack of a business case for investment (e.g. GSK in malaria and Novartis in typhoid vaccine development). GSK is an important contributor to the current effort on Ebola vaccines. The simplistic opportunism of taking a new understanding of these longstanding challenges to discredit the global vaccine industry is unfortunate. To ascribe that view incorrectly to me, when I was simply explaining the problem and not attributing blame, is very poor journalism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd actually like to see the %GDP defense spending normalized per capita or per size of military to determine if Canada is actually spending a 'fair' amount with respect to other NATO allies.

After all, 2%GDP could be a fairly arbitrary assignment...

It seems kind of foolish for each allied NATO country to have separate mutually exclusive military spending programs.  The USA, France, etc. might be better at producing military equipment and aircraft, while Canada might be better at producing multilingual officers and personnel for training missions.  If the different allied nations were organized to focus on particular military niches it might benefit NATO as a whole.  

I realize NATO wasn't designed to be a shared western military, but that seems to increasingly be what it's becoming, so why not embrace that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to be needlessly contrary, but beyond a certain point, what value does wealth generation serve? Aggregating capital is enormously important in an economy for sure. However, I think its fair to say that there are individuals and corporations operating today that have amassed more wealth than they can ever realistically use... Pools of capital that just sit there, not benefitting the economy or really the owner of the wealth.

I think this problem stems from employment without ownership. A lot of companies today give equity over time to their workers, but such practices should be wider spread.

"Work" doesn't have value

Maybe this is needlessly philosophical, but when a bare majority of the eligible voting population casts a ballot, and a minority of that subpopulation gains a majority share of seats in a legislature, it can be strongly argued that there is no true mandate for that resulting government.

If everyone is required to vote, however, then a true mandate is assured.

I think this mostly stems from the perceived inconvenience of physically casting a ballot, rather than sense of the state infringing on one's right to ignore politics.

If voting was easier, I think most people would accept being required to at least select none of the above.

There would be hold-outs, sure. Much like those who refuse to get vaccinated, but I think it would be an acceptably small population. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like the endless arguments on transit completely ignore the [reality of congestion](http://natpo.st/1l7elWu), and the fact that by and large a car is always going to be perceived as a preferred option until tolls are introduced. Notwithstanding that paying for new transit demands new revenue models.

Yesterday, I was sitting in a packed bus on Lakeshore moving at a snail's pace through a traffic jam of SUVs, trucks, and cars all carrying only a single passenger each.

We are deluding ourselves that any transit plan will work short of better incentivizing fewer cars in city limits and busy highways as well as carpooling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think the resulting atmosphere would expand outwards.

It would, but air pressure in the atmosphere is a gradient from the surface out into orbit.  What we experience on the surface as air pressure, which varies with weather patterns, would change significantly if earth suddenly had a lot more air surrounding it.  It's sort of like if you were standing at the bottom of the ocean, the weight of all the water above you creates absolutely enormous pressures. We live at the bottom of a giant ocean of gas.

CO2 makes up less than half a percent of the total atmosphere, so the amount of nitrogen and oxygen you would need to bring CO2 levels back to normal would likely be significant (21 molecules of O2 and 79 molecules of nitrogen for every excess molecule of CO2).  Removing that much water from the water cycle to make enough O2 would also likely be a significant impact, you would have to harvest these gases from asteroids and moons in our solar system.

That being said, atmosphere 'building' is a fascinating field of study.  Mars has an atmosphere that is mostly CO2, and its gravity is less than earth, so to make an earth-like atmosphere there on the surface, I believe I read somewhere that its atmosphere would be 3x the size of earth's, either in terms of depth or total volume... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   If the atmosphere is 1M kerplecks of gas, and there is 400 kerplecks of CO2, then adding 1 kerpleck of CO2, needs 2499 kerplecks of O2 to keep the 400 ppm CO2 ratio.

The atmosphere is actually mostly nitrogen though, N2, and only about 21% oxygen.  

Even if the ratio of CO2 to the other gases were held constant, I think you could expect additional effects from adding so much additional gas, increasing our total atmospheric pressure.

	<TEXT>  electrolysis works with salt and dirty water too.

Yeah, but for a large scale process using briney water or water with a lot of impurities means increased issues of fouling, scaling, corrosion, etc.  Also, chlorine gas from chloride ions comes to mind... You can get around it with reverse osmosis, but each step along the way makes your process increasingly non-economical.  Depending on the amount of energy production in distributed locations, you might be able to rely on rain water.

 I wonder if releasing O2 into atmosphere would by necessity reduce CO2 and other pollutant ppm rates?

It would just dilute CO2, and only negligibly so.  Realistically, to reduce atmospheric CO2 you need to scavenge it out of the atmosphere.  I recall reading somewhere that while sounding absurd, because coniferous forests in the northern hemisphere are so rapidly regenerative, one of the best options to reduce atmospheric CO2 would be a logging and tree-planting operation to literally strip CO2 out of the atmosphere, storing it as biomass. (Some people talk about scaling this better with some giant algae farm as well)

That's the one upside of plastics being non-biodegradable is at least that's petroleum-originating carbon that will remain out of the atmosphere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Big oil invests a lot in hydrogen production, as pure hydrogen is an important component in various upgrading and refining processes.  However, the process remains more economical to generate the hydrogen from natural gas (methane) rather than water.

I like to think this will change as solar drives down the cost of energy and the petroleum industry shifts more towards materials (plastics, polymers, etc.).

However, it's very possible that the value of fresh water could change dramatically in the future... </TEXT>

This argument would carry more weight if other countries employed such restrictive communications policies on their government scientists, which is not at all the case, for instance [the American policy](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7387/full/483006a.html) on this issue is:

 In the United States, President Barack Obama's administration has directed federal science agencies to develop integrity policies with clear guidelines for scientists who are approached by journalists.

 In December, agencies including the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued guidelines that promote openness with the press. For instance, NOAA and NSF-funded scientists and staff are free to speak to journalists without first seeking the approval of a public-affairs officer. The NSF's policy states that researchers are free to express their personal views as long as they make clear that they are not speaking on behalf of the agency. And scientists also have right of review over agency publications and press releases that claim to represent their expert opinions.

	<TEXT>  But this culture is wrong and needs our culture instead

Multiculturalism isn't the melting pot. New cultures aren't erased, they're absorbed, respected, and acknowledged. However, prejudices, discrimination, violence and superstitions of cultures shouldn't be indulged simply because they're part of a nation's heritage. And, just because a group of people have historically resided in some geographical area does not provide them any divine right to continue discrimination, prejudice, hate or violence towards themselves or other groups, nor to exist in isolation to continue such behavior.

*"No man is an island entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 
own were; any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind. 
And therefore never send to know for whom 
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." -John Donne*
