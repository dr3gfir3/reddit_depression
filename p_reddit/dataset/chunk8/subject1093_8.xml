Because your account is new (under 10 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.
This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/cats requires all accounts to be at least **10 days old** AND have **at least 25 comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have less than 25 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.
Questions? [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcats) and let us know.

Unfortunately it has been removed because it must be a direct image link. **If your imgur submission is an imgur album with multiple images, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcrappydesign) so we can approve it manually.**

**PLEASE NOTE THAT, IF YOU USE AN APP, SUCH AS REDDIT IS FUN, TO UPLOAD YOUR IMAGE, YOU WILL NEED TO USE A DIFFERENT APP OR THE MOBILE WEBSITE TO UPLOAD YOUR IMAGE AND SUBMIT YOUR POST.**  Some apps, mainly Reddit Is Fun, incorrectly upload single images as albums.  You can report this issue to the developer of the app you're using (/r/redditisfun, for the biggest offender).

Otherwise, please re-submit using a direct image link (must end in jpg, gif, png, etc), thanks. [These instructions might help.](http://i.imgur.com/RjrqakK.gifv)  

Or see if one of these links works:

Also, if your link ends in ?1 please remove that before submitting.

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abzc6/short_story_of_your_success/).

	<TITLE> Official Weekly RAW Editing Challenge! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 12:38:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **The Official Weekly RAW Editing Challenge!**

***

Every week, we post a new RAW file for you to edit - you can download this file via the link at the bottom of this post. After you have made all the edits you wish, post a link to your final edit in this thread so other users can view/critique it and upvote their favourite edits. The winner is the user with most upvotes by the end of the week.

The winner can send us one of their photos to be used in next week's competition.

***

**Rules:**

* All RAW files in these threads will be released under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** (See rules in the sidebar.)

* Links in your comment must lead directly to your submission.

* If you enter the competition, you must be willing to provide a RAW file for next week's competition. The moderators will message you if this is the case.

* If you enter the competition, you must vote on other people's entries.

* Don't downvote everyone else in a thread or use bots/fake accounts to upvote yourself or the moderators might **shadowban** you.

This thread will be in **contest mode** until the end of the week. This means submissions will not display in any particular order.

***

**This week's RAW file:**

(DNG link) (Preview link)


**Note from the photographer:**

"Got a DSLR recently and etc... Please credit me as etc..."

***

**Note:**

If there is no link to a RAW file, the moderators are still waiting for a file from last week's winner and will update this post as soon as one is available. </TEXT>

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

Unfortunately, this has become necessary to combat video spam   people who only use the subreddit to blatantly advertise their content. Please do not contact the moderators asking about the participation level required for submitting content - we do not reveal it but it is quite low and any reasonably active commenter should reach it easily. You can find our rules regarding advertising and self-promotion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/about/rules/).

	<TEXT> Hello, Your post appears to be too vague and breaks Rule 6 (and possibly others) of /r/mildlyinteresting and has been removed. Your title must be a concise description of the content. No jokes, backstories or other fluff. "This was inside my car" or "The way this door opens" are unacceptable. It should act as a "spoiler" for the image. If it leaves the viewer surprised in some way after viewing, it will be removed. [Read about rule 6 in more detail here or in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/21p15y/rule_6_for_dummies/). Still unsure? Feel free to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmildlyinteresting) with a link to this post for a detailed explanation.

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

	<TEXT> We changed our name to r/POTUSWatch a week ago, that was because we decided we're going to track President Donald Trump's successors too and because other subs have refused to help us due to our name containing the word "Trump" so we didn't really have much choice. We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :)

	<TEXT> We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses "()" or braces "{}" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only "[W]" but not also "[H]" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Please also take this time to [examine our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/rules) for future reference.

If you intend to contact us about this action (or any other ones), please ensure that you have read this comment in its entirety (making sure to read through any relevant links) and make sure you grasp a full understanding of what it means *before* contacting us.

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).
