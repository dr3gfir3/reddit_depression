The gun stuff sucks here and I'm trying to move back to Kansas. It'll suck commuting into Overland Park if I can get s job there, but at least I'll be able to make the 6 or so hour drive to my grandpa's land and hunt some pheasants.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I have my get rich idea. Pick your rounds and your pay scale.  
  
Cheapest monthly fee - You get whatever I have that's cheapest.  
   
Tier 2 - Cleaner ammo that's as cheap as I can get, so no Thunderbolt ammo here, but could be the same ammo as the cheapest if that's what I got for them!  
  
Tier 3 - Some sexier ammo, like a 6 or 7 but it's late at night so she's a 9.  
  
Tier 4 - This is some sweet ammo, basically the ammo people go, "This stuff is great, I'd buy 200 boxes if I had the money."  
  
Tier 5 - Why are you part of this club? Double ammo for you, sexy ammo and something a little less sexy but you'll like the way it moves.  
  
People pick the rounds they're looking for, we'll try to send out different ammo types each month if you have multiple selected.  Maybe a set for rifle and a set for handgun and then maybe even a "hard to get" set of price points for rare ammo in the future. </TEXT>

40 ammo has been a lot cheaper as well and basically there's now a growing civilian segment for it. Don't fear the 40 and you can shoot whatever's cheapest. I say this as someone that owns handguns in lots of calibers. Avoid 45LC you can't find it cheap anywhere :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can get some meat like this in the states, but it's rare. Market hunting basically makes animals in the US extinct, but if you could get a USDA guy to observe the hunting and cleaning and butchering meat could come this way. There's an Indian group that does it and most venison and other meat for sale comes from NZ. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Why kill them when I can keep them as slaves, though?

That's the essence of dairy versus feed cows and horses used for work versus horses eaten, it's your preference for their use.  
  
Not a difference that allows you to kill one but not the other.  
  
You mean between humans and animals, sure does. Unless you live somewhere with laws you're following that forbid the killing of people, then your preferences don't matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jimmy Carter turned down secret service protection, he said it was a waste of taxpayers money. With all other presidents the secret service doesn't reveal how much is spent for security reasons. Currently ex presidents and their spouses (as long as they don't remarry after the ex president dies) get protection for life, their protection changes based on need. Their kids up until 16. Special circumstances allow the secret service to add or extend protection to the children for longer if needed. </TEXT>

I used the mag extenders. And I have a Taurus the exact same size. My MP buddy and a few others have shot it. Unlikely everyone is able to reproduce the same problem even when I don't tell them the issue and I say, "here shoot this gun" and they hit low and to the right.  
  
When I called I was calm. Thanks for assuming I was a whiny brat though. Shows how you feel about people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did. And they sent it back still shooting off and when I called the first time their gunsmith was very dismissive. That's why I don't recommend them. Their customer service is poor and they don't fix their products. They also don't tell you what they did in any detail. I can't let people invest in a product they seem to care so little about when so many other companies have helped me more with guns I've purchased used. Thanks bought the scccy new and I wish I could have just returned it after seeing how it shot. The no laquor rounds wasn't a deal breaker. But when it shoots low and to the right and I have multiple shooters try it out and I can shoot all my other pistols straight I lean toward the gun being fucked up. Other gun smiths have said it sounds like the barrel. I called and told them the issue. The lady on the line wasn't sure what to do. Transfered me to what she said was their head guy. He was dismissive about the issue. But said they had some upgrades for it and to send it in. So I did. Comes back with the same issue. I don't have time to waste with a shitty company, but I'll bash them all day online without hesitation to prevent anyone else from being fucked over.  </TEXT>
