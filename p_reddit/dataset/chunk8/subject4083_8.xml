	<TEXT>  I never understood how Americans gave so much Shit about it though it appears you guys don't even need to do a driving test in a manual?

Back in the day you could drive in the US like you could in Europe.  Lots of somewhat reasonably maintained highways, not much bumper to bumper traffic, long road trips were common, etc, so a manual was fun.

Now my 18 mile commute to work can take over an hour at least three days a week and a manual in those conditions is more than just silly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Literally.  Wife's boss called me a few weeks back to pick my brain over a new car.  All his kids are finally gone and he got to buy *something fun*.

"Well, if you got the cash, then a 911, Boxster, or 718 is the way to go man."

He texted her to tell me to check his FB.  He bought a TTS.

So why'd you get the TTS?

"I liked the styling better, I liked the interior more, and while the Porsche drove better in the end, it didn't drive 30k better."

He made a good and well informed choice after test driving the various vehicles.  Glad he got the TTS, it's a hell of a car.  If they made an actual TTS cabrio instead of a roadster I'd consider one of them over a 718 myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go to 6th street.  Plenty of bands.

Restaurants to check out:

Barley Swine - Small plates, New American Style food, great cocktails.

Kemuri Tatsuya - Texas BBQ/Japanese Izakaya Fusion, solid cocktails. 

Wu Chow - Authentic/Chinese American, solid cocktails.

Thai Kun - Some American Style Thai and some Legit Thai, decent cocktails.

Whip In - Great beer selection, indian food, burgers

Elizabeth Street Cafe - Vietnamese and decent cocktails

Barlata - Spanish style tapas, solid cocktails

Torchy's Tacos - If you're not from around here, might as well try em.  No cocktails.

Uchiko/Uchi - Awarded best Sushi restaurant in the country for a reason.

El Naranjo - Oaxaca food.  Best food.


Out of the above the ones I'd go out of my way for: Kemuri, Barley Swine, Barlata. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cocktails were on point.  I had the old fashioned and the gin drink and tequila based drink that comes in the tulip glass.  Well mixed and balanced.

Did not get the ramen or BBQ, but we plan on going back again this weekend.  I'll have one of the ramen bowls or we'll see if the rest of the table would like to split the BBQ boat.

Chicken Heart - Basically red meat chicken.  Flavor was great but it was room temp when it got to the table.  Offal needs to be good and warm when served.

Corned Beef Tongue - On the specials menu, also very well balanced, incredibly tender as well.  The pickled onions were so-so but I really dug the pickled mustard seed.

Squid fritters - Forgot what they're called.  Come with some tortilla strips and a spoonful of chili.  Could use more chili and the fritter was more fritter than squid.  Only disappointment the whole night, really.  

Street corn - Surprisingly good, actually.  Comes covered in mayo, fish flakes, lemon, and something else.  Probably not bonito, but maybe?  Not really fish flakes but shaved strands of something that is fishy which I assumed to be bonito.

Munkfish liver - It is what you think it is.  Very fishy pate.  Incredible texture, served at the appropriate temperature.


Things I didn't try that I want to try:

Dank tofu.  Dank due to the blue cheese and not because it is stinky tofu, which it isn't.  I don't like stinky tofu!

Natto - I don't like stinky tofu, and I'm pretty sure this is just the king stank of stinky tofu, but I want to be able to say I tried it.

Dipping ramen - I hear it's the best way to have their chili and I've never had dipping ramen before.

Puff puff pass - Communal alcohol drink.  Looks fun.  



I definitely dug it.  It will probably go on my list of regular meeting places for when me and some friends get afternoon drinks/snacks when we're in that area.  Usually we just hit up Whip In.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Xiaolongbao are a similar size but don't have lots of juice inside

What?  Of course they do.  

Tangbao are "bao" sized, like shenjianbao, or the size of a fist.  The wrapper is a bit similar to xiaolongbao though.  Tangbao is often served with a straw for you to drink the soup out of the middle.

 Neither is served in a soup

This is correct. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ha!  Most people don't envy living with their MiL but the master bedroom and my office are upstairs, so she pretty much has the whole downstairs to herself.  Her english is non existent and my Chinese is so-so, so we only speak when needed and usually just pleasantries.  She also takes care of the baby so that's a ton of money we save each month as well.


And she cooks xiaolongbao, hongshaorou, shenjianbao, etc all the time.   </TEXT>
