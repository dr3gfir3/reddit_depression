This. 

I'm old enough to remember how excited "Republicans" were when W. was elected in 2000 and how they all wanted you to know that they were "Republican".  Fast forward to 2008 and those same people, when asked to defend George W. Bush's policies, would quickly tell you that they are "Independent".

You're pulling that number out of your ass.  The number is closer to 30% with another 30% calling themselves conservative.

"Liberal" is a term Conservative Republicans throw out as an insult to anyone who doesn't see the world exactly as they do.

You're obviously an idiot.  "Liberal" is a word that is used to identify with a whole host of social and economic issues, to say it is only used as a term of derision is simply not true.  </TEXT>

Because I want everyone who is reading this thread to know how much of an imbecile you are.  The anecdotal evidence that you are relying on isn't going to fly.  I gave you actual voting statistics and you dismissed them for some reason that is only clear to you.  You made an assertion that is provably false, and instead of admitting your error you have doubled down on it.  

And, to top it all off, you are getting angry.  I'm sorry that my desire to have a conversation based on "facts" and "provable evidence" has triggered you.  Perhaps you should retreat to your safe space before you melt down completely little snowflake.  Lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm simply asking for evidence that supports your claim that "Montgomery is not liberal".  The evidence that we have, voting statistics, show that Montgomery overwhelmingly voted for the liberal democrat for president in the 2016 election.  That is evidence of more liberals than conservatives in Montgomery.  You, apparently, reject that evidence for some reason.  

So, all I want is for you to prove (through evidence) that "Montgomery is not liberal".  

I know you can't do that because that evidence doesn't exist.  You know you can't do that because that evidence doesn't exist.  

You'll probably respond to this post with some profanity, perhaps a personal attack but I'm certain you will not provide a reputable source that proves your claims because your claim (Montgomery is not liberal) isn't true.   </TEXT>
