	<TEXT> I have social anxiety and low self-esteem, and I want to get rid of it. while I've gotten better at it, I'm not at the point where I can just go to random people and start a conversation

my confidence is low and my self-esteem is also low. 2 things seem to contribute to this

1. my weight. I'm working on it, but it takes time. my weight has always been something I'm self-conscious about. I mean, why the hell would a girl want to have anything to do with some nerdy fat guy. even if I'm just trying to make friends with other guys I feel self-conscious about it. I'm always worried about other people seeing me as being 'fat' and nothing else

2. I seem to always compare myself to other people. I don't know why it happens, it just does. I sometimes wish I was as successful as other people, and I really wish I was confident and loved myself like everyone else seems to be. I wish I could overcome my social anxiety and be able to post my success story here like others

I'll also admit too, I don't like myself because of these faults and I have trouble loving myself, and many people even say I'm too hard on myself

my last year of college begins in one month, and when I move in I want to be confident enough to go meet all the new people in my dorm, knock on peoples doors and start conversations, and just not give a fuck about what people think of me. any advice on trying to achieve this goal and to just get rid of my social anxiety or I.prove self esteem is appreciated </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I realized that a lot of my problems come from trying to impress people in order for them to like me and possibly become friends.

but do people really look at all the things you've accomplished and all the things you've done to determine if your worthy of being a friend? apparently that seems to be my mindset, and that's the reason I do things just to impress people

so what do people look for in others when determining whether they can be a good friend or not. or another way to think of it, what determines our worth as a person? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [needadvice] Feelings of worthlessness keeping down and making it harder to achieve my goals </TITLE>

	<TEXT> after some thinking over why I feel bad when I was trying to achieve my goals and why I've failed at my recent goals, I realized I was basically saying to myself "I can't do it". and that thought was basically caused by me feeling like I'm worthless, or I'm not good enough

thinking more about it, I don't know she. I started thinking like this, but its been that way for as long as I can remember. and further, there's proof in my life that seems to fuel the thought of being worthless, like the fact that I haven't achieved anything significant in life, rarely ever worked my ass off in comparison to other people, and just have always been lazy and have nothing to show for my life

either way, its dragging me down, and I want to know how to reverse this thinking and be more positive.

I know it may not be entirely related to getting disciplined, but everyone here has given me such good advice already, and this feeling/thoughts are what are keeping me from achieving my goals and getting disciplined </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is good advice, but the big thing preventing me from doing that is fear. I'm very socially anxious, and something simple like walking into a bar alone for example is just way to frightening for me </TEXT>
