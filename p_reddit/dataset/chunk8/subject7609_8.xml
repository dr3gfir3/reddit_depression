	<TEXT> This makes it more interesting.

Le Pen is probably trying to get the anti-Israel left vote for her because Macron is pro-Israel. 

Let's see if the anti-Israel crowd buys it and vote for her despise being far right.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not true.

There where 67 Israeli soldiers killed and 469 wounded.

And the reason why the civilian count was so high is because  many werent oficially part of Hamas, but they still were considered as civilians figthers. Ad Hamas placed bombs and missiles from densily populated areas like schools and hospitals. The UN denounced all of this.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay accused Hamas militants of violating international humanitarian law by "locating rockets within schools and hospitals, or even launching these rockets from densely populated areas."[359] The European Union condemned Hamas, and in particular condemned "calls on the civilian population of Gaza to provide themselves as human shields."[400][401] Confirmation of this practice was produced by correspondents from France24, The Financial Times, and RT, who respectively filmed a rocket launch pad which was placed in a civilian area next to a hotel where international journalists were staying,[402] reported on rockets being fired from near Al-Shifa Hospital, and reported on Hamas firing rockets near a hotel.[403] In September 2014, a Hamas official acknowledged to an Associated Press reporter that the group had fired rockets from civilian areas.[404]

The PMW is used by many non Israel press. So their translations are legit.

International media regularly cite and quote PMW translations as accurate representations of Palestinian Arabic-language media. News organizations that cite PMW as a source include: Chicago Sun-Times[12][13] the Associated Press,[14][15] The Telegraph[16][17] and The Washington Post.[18]
