Tool: Tableau

I wanted to create a visualization that showed how the hours that men work each week compares to the number of hours that woman work. To do this I used data published by the American Community Survey, a product of the US Census Bureau. I utilized the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample to create this visualization. The data can be found on the ACS Website. Once I had the data, I used Tableau to visualize the data. I grouped the Usual hours worked per week past 12 months variable into the groups I wanted, formatted it, and published the visualization on Tableau Public </TEXT>

Tool: Tableau

To gather the data for this visualization, I utilized the Census Bureaus API to create a custom table for myself. I decided to use the ACS 5 Year Estimates for 2011-2015 so I could get data on all counties. I used the html address below to pull the data. You can find more out about the Census API at their website. You will need a free API Key to pull data from their site.
http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs5/profile?get=NAME,DP02_0058E,DP02_0059E,DP02_0060E,DP02_0061E,DP02_0062E,DP02_0063E,DP02_0064E,DP02_0065E for=county:* key=
Once I had the data in a usable form, I used Tableau to create the visualization. I combined the data fields of Less than 9th Grade and 9th to 12th Grade, No Diploma to determine the proportion of the population without a high school education. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few weeks ago, I created a [visualization on how home value compares to income in each US county](http://overflow.solutions/demographic-data/how-home-value-compares-to-income-in-the-us/). That visualization mapped the data so I could see the geographic trends. It looked like all the places with higher ratios were focused around metro area so I made this visualization. It shows the ratio for the number of years worth of median income it would take to equal the median value of homes in that metro area.The dataviz starts by showing the 25 metro areas with the largest populations, but the filters can be used to adjust it.

To create this data visualization I gathered data from the American Community Survey. I used the 2015 ACS 1 years estimates from Table B25064, B25077, and B25071 on American FactFinder. I then manipulated the data in excel and used Tableau to visualize the data. If you are interested in the data used for this visualization you can find more data like it in [my post the compare these points on a scatter plot.](http://overflow.solutions/demographic-data/how-does-income-compare-to-home-value-in-u-s-metro-areas/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Getting married, when you get married, and your circumstances when you get married are all a big deal to almost everyone I know. Because of that, I wanted to create a data visualizations that shows when people get married and a little bit about what is going on in their life.
To do this I gathered data published by the American Community Survey, a product of the US Census Bureau. I used the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample to create this visualization. The data can be found on the ACS Website.
Once I had the data, I utilized Tableau to visualize the data. I then added filters for sex, region, and educational attainment so people could personalize the visualization to match their circumstance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very cool visualization. I really like the work you put into the icons.

It would be interesting to figure out if seasons with a team is a function of how good you are or if how good you are determines how long you stay with a team. I am guessing the function is the opposite of what was displayed and teams keep good coaches. </TEXT>
