	<TEXT> The DJ was spinning some old tunes at the Death concert at gramps in Wynwood last night, and played this track. I had my camera on and recorded a video to capture the song. I thought my brother would know what it is, but he can't name it. Anyone? Video capturing the song: https://youtu.be/fePdvvCo5w4 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went through Hurricane Andrew in South Florida on August 24, 1992. I was 20 years old. We were 5 in our family plus two dogs. My dad had a co-worker and his two cats stay with us during the storm because his own apartment was a pre-fab and not sturdy. My girlfriend was also with us. This was in a decent modern-built 4/2 house. I had been through hurricanes before, so we knew how to prepare, though none had ever done what Andrew did. It came in at night, so everyone was in bed sleeping, but as the eye of the storm got closer, we all woke up from the howling noise and huddled together in the hallway. The "Oh shit!" moment was when the wind was strong enough to blow in the double front doors, which then blew the wind through the house and blew the back doors out, so we had a tunnel of super fast wind and rain streaming through the house. As we sat on the floor in the hallway, I could feel the entire house slightly lifting up off the foundation and feel air moving from underneath the walls!. The eye went over us, which gives you a few minutes of calm, then the other wall eye passes and the wind blows everything the opposite direction. We all made it through without physical harm, but the house was left nothing but walls and part of a roof. A few days after the storm when I could actually drive around a bit, I actually got lost in the neighborhood I had grown up in and knew like the back of my hand. The houses had no paint, the trees were gone or leafless. Not one streetsign left. Utter destruction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The era from Kiln House to Heroes Are Hard To Find is really enjoyable. As a die-hard Mac fan, though, I have to say there are FOUR eras. 
1: Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac - Then Play On 
2: Kiln House - Heroes Are Hard To Find
3: Fleetwood Mac - Tango In the Night
4: Behind The Mask - now

I'm not at all a fan of the last leg, in fact I have to say my love wanes as the era gets later. </TEXT>
