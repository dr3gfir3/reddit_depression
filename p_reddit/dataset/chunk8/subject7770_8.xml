	<TEXT> Hey r/selfimprovemnt! 
I know this is a difficult and rooted issue I have but I need to starting turning my life around and I'm hoping i can start here with this post. All my life I have struggled with my insecurities and the lack of confidence which has resulted in me to get no where in life, which in turn makes me feel like a constant failure. currently a 19m who only has about 5 friends. I also go to community college and already have 4 W's under my name(I dropped a semester due to a break up with my girlfriend) . Im constantly broke despite having a job since the age of 18. I also just got unemployed for failing to pass my ptcb which is my pharmacy tech test. And to finally add the icing to the cake my ex girlfriend who used to be the only sun shine in my life is living the time of her life attending one of the best schools In the states. I also hate the fact that she's the only girl I hangout with.! Even though I enjoy her company it makes me feel like a pathetic loser when I hangout with her due to the fact that she is makes  friends constantly at school( while getting hit on a dating other people), she also has a nice job, and is acing school.

How do I turn my life around I'm tired feeling like a loser and letting people down. I struggle with depression... but sometimes I feel like that's an excuse now. </TEXT>
