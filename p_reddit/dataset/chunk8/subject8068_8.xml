	<TEXT> My .02: of the recent villainous heroes, or heroic villains, whichever you like to call them, I found that I really enjoyed Will Smith's Deadshot - even more than Batman and Superman (in most any of the incarnations I've encountered, not strictly the ones we saw in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). My initial attraction was entirely aesthetic - cool costume, nice guns. But seeing that this guy ended up saving the world simply so that his daughter would think he was an alright guy, it really adds a dimension of humanity that I can relate to.

To pull from Game of Thrones - take Stannis Baratheon. In the books, he's one man hellbent on doing the right thing. I found it refreshing given the series abundance of political subterfuge and betrayals. Stannis's use of shadow magic and blood magic via burning his prisoners - executing people that earned a death sentence, but getting a use out of the execution - added a touch of humanity. It made him interesting, slightly dangerous, and made him more fun to read about. But what makes draws me to Stannis is that he's using this blood magic and shadow magic against monsters far worse than he is.

	<TEXT> OP I'd be more IDGAF if you know what you like, and I wouldn't feel bad at all for liking a certain type of literature. An acquaintance of mine was writing a paper on Shakespeare or someone like that. She asked if I'd read him and liked the classics since I've got the highest GPA in our department. I laughed, told her I like Stephen King and Conan the Barbarian. She didn't care, thought it was funny.

I forgot about those Planeswalker decks they started with Kaladesh. Do those have the consistency of the old precons? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say Lorwyn is my least favorite, Flamekin aside. The art direction didn't really inspire or encourage me - and the switch to Shadowmoor didn't really give you any explanation as to where all these new and exciting beasties were coming from.

That said, the Flamekin and crazy elementals were the saving grace from LorTide Block.

Our Return blocks have also felt smaller than the originals, and thereby aren't as great. </TEXT>
