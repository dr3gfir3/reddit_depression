	<TEXT> My name is Martin Aragon. I've posted a few times and will post a few more, because I find the anonymity and ability to 'tell-all' without the necessity to confirm my convictions fascinating. Everyone writes with conviction, but the veil of anonymity, as well as the opportunity for a 'suspended reality', allows for the existence of worlds that reality would never allow. An unsavvy reader could find himself lost in a tirade of dementia and narcissistic extremism, entertained by false assumptions of fairy tales and illusions, while he's sucked into a treacherous universe whose only utility is to torture and ensnare. It happens on a regular basis; we read into things, assuming the writer has our best interests at heart, when, in reality, the sincerity and devotion you expect, simply is not there.

Feel free to believe that all or none of this is true, but don't negate your desire to understand worlds and possibilities that you can never, ever know. People don't want the truth. That's why you'll follow me. You want a mystery. Is the man behind the screen really a murderer? It all seems so impossible... I mean... have I really made myself responsible for the souls of thirteen people? People you kill become your slaves in the afterlife, which is an unfortunate circumstance that I'm trying to rectify. I want to educate, but what wisdom could I share to make up for my sins? I understand my purpose, but not what to do about those I've harmed. I mean... what could be the reason that I had to kill? What was the purpose for the bloodshed and mayhem and despair? Is wisdom so important that people have to die in order for it to be understood?

These are questions I never intend to answer. I like to raise questions and let them go. They fester and form like bacteria, reaching out over a few and then everyone. That's not wisdom. Information is as much a virus as Ebola. People go wild with information, but mysteries are especially troublesome. The mind needs a mystery, like the body needs a sick virus to kill, so it can prepare our immune system. I recommend throwing a few good mysteries into your life, something to captivate, before you return to the banality of everyday life. If you learn to love disseminating small bits of information first, then the greater mysteries that infect us won't seem so terrifying. 

Life isn't about digesting and regurgitating, shoving clusters of ill-informed tid-bits down your throat and regurgitating nonsensical yammerings for which you feel no attachment. This is what feeds the fear. Stop. Examine. Chew, before you digest. Let your incisors sever every link to what you perceive, until it's broken down and used to fuel you to discover more mysteries. Above all, always keep entertained. If you're bored you'll die without a purpose and no one will remember your name.

My victims were my mystery. The entertainment was in knowing their desires, but not in some annotated sense of perceiving, studying... hunting. I learned so much more by talking, listening and, above all, maintaining eye-contact no matter how hard they fought. I felt an attachment to all of my victims. Their stories are significant to defining my struggle and humanity's 'quest for meaning' in an empty, unsupervised universe. Mine is the struggle of all great philosphers: to know. 

I know at this moment that there is no apologizing for murder. I won't be greeted at any 'pearly gates'. Most likely, if there is an afterlife, I'll find peace after thousands of years of torment. I'm going to hell. My victims will be there, because that's the intent. Their heaven consists of tearing my flesh, using my bones as instruments of further torment, making me eat my intestines in an infinite loop for eternity. 

The worst of these inevitable levels of hell is the one where they demand answers. There can be no apologies, but answers... I have none. How do you tell someone you killed that you did it to entertain yourself? How do you say that you put your faith in some 'greater force', because you knew you couldnt trust yourself? It's not an acceptable answer. They don't deserve that. Hopefully, I have plenty of time to work on my apology, while I fight the urge to create more slaves in the afterlife. 

Truth is all that matters, but truth is the easiest thing to manipulate, twist, skin, boil alive, in order to make it more appetizing. We think truth is ugly and for some reason the mental gymnastics that we play on it are all beautiful. Distortion of truth is disgusting. We manipulate so we can digest. I've been doing it for a long time, but before I get into that, I'd rather offer my confession:

Thirteen people I killed thirteen two men and eleven women. I liked the thought of that number remaining. There is every possibility that if I continue, the cosmic sequence will end and the universe will tumble into oblivion. I'll leave it there for now, until the divine hand guides me to a deeper understanding. The clock strikes twelve. If it ever hits thirteen... the cosmic dance comes to an end.

My first victim was a man I like to call 'Travis'. I apologize for not sharing his real name, but that belongs to me now. Travis was a homeless gentleman I met outside a restaurant one night. I took him to a diner. He had chicken soup with crackers, a glass of water, a side of bread and a slab of undercooked tilapia. I recommended the tilapia, as he wouldn't have ordered it otherwise. I could tell he was hungry, but he thought he would be nice and not order more than a bowl of soup. I asked Travis to tell me all about his life. He was a son, but never knew his father. His mother worked to raise him and his seven siblings, although four of them died before they could reach their teens. He hadn't seen his family for over twenty years, roughly the same amount of time he'd spent on the streets. There was kindness in his eyes with a humble gentleness and just a hint of sorrow. Pain shows itself in these unkempt blemishes, bright orbs of light that explode into the cloudiness of our pupils. If you look close enough, you can count a mans sins by studying his eyes.  

I killed Travis a few blocks from the diner. I examined the area a week before and found that a body could be disposed of easily behind a vacant lot three blocks down from the diner. Several abandoned buildings lined the streets. People avoided this part of town, so no one would bother looking, not that they'd care about an old homeless man. We walked towards the vacant lot, but I told him we were going to a hotel. I would buy him a room and let him sleep for the night in a comfortable bed. I brought him around the side of the old 'Matrix Agynsta Industrial Complex', which was occupied by a law firm, several condominiums and a dental office along a brighter timeline in American history. He saw the chain-link fence and turned, just as I charged, stabbing him in the stomach with a hunting knife. I made sure to twist the blade when I felt it hit an impasse near his stomach. The twist dislodged the blade, before cutting its way out. 

Travis looked so surprised. His eyes lit up with an explosion of thoughts that triggered so much emotion. If death hadnt come he wouldve gone insane. I stabbed him again. I put one hand on his shoulder and dug the blade into his stomach. I lost control from this point. Really, the memory is all sort of... cluttered. There was so much emotion. The rush of it... murder is the only drug. 

I cleaned his blood from my blade and put it back in its hiding place. The mess of his insides was framed by his tattered form. His body lay in a wreck alongside the back of the dumpster, where he would remain for several weeks, before someone finally found him. His eyes told a greater story than anything he'd told me. The sincerity of his lie is something that I will never forget. It was the truth or what he wanted to believe. 

I find a particular fascination in their eyes. Everyone has a story and they tell it better if you look into their eyes. Travis never let go. Despite the wave of terror rolling over him, Travis clung to a mystifying reality. His pupil held firmly in place, shuttering, blinking, but remaining centered. It was amazing to see it twitch. I expected it to tear apart and become awash in the ocean of white. 

He lied to me. 

I thought killing men in the prime of their lives would be enough of a challenge to entertain me, but it became systematic and boring. I found the idea of the hunt, taking down powerful men, like predators forced into battle by survival, honorable. The equation never added up and this quickly became a plan that sounded much better than it was in practice. Men present no challenge when they die. Women are fighters. I respect them much more as adversaries and hold for them the utmost respect. 

The death of a man holds less meaning than the death of a woman. It was much less fulfilling to see the light fade from Travis' eyes. A man holds onto a lie well into death, while a woman will compromise. She'll hold onto it, of course, but it'll mold her, as she makes her way closer to the inevitable. 

My second victim was a woman. It's because of her that I understood this principle and all I needed to know about the afterlife. It was the first time I killed a woman, but after that, their destruction and doom was the only thing that made sense. It wasn't that they had to suffer. They wanted to suffer, but also wanted an end to their pain. Death meant release. I have trouble discouraging the thought that these women needed me to set them free.

I remember the moment I knew that Calliope needed to die. She was young and beautiful and all the more perfect. It wasn't long after I found her that I became obsessed. I've always had a rape fantasy, since I was a teenager and not long into meeting her I fantasized about tearing off her clothes and abusing her in countless ways. She became an obsession to me. There has never been a need for me to fulfill these urges. It's not the same to me as murder. It's an abhorrent thing. Rapists deserve a rotting death, torment by scavengers that pick the flesh from their bones, while they scream in agony. 

Calliope was a runaway. I don't know who would ever abandon her. I took her in, provided food and shelter. Nobody knew about her. Her parents were across the country. She was such a sweet girl. I fantasized every night about her rape, but never her murder. It's harder for me to fantasize about killing, because I know it's possible. I can murder, but rape is beyond me, which is where I want it to stay. Complicated emotions tangled around her and the inevitable suffering I would cause her. She was sixteen when I found her. I couldn't make sense of these thoughts. Did I want to fuck her or set her free? I think my original plan was to save her, but that's probably a lie. I don't know, I really don't... or I don't want to accept the truth. My intent was always calculated... cold blooded. I knew that, no matter how I loved her... Calliope had to die.

My obsession with this beautiful young girl brought on a conflict between impulse and emotion. I wanted her to live. Setting her free was the right thing to do. She was beautiful, inside and out... this is how I justify her salvation. Such a warped ideology that I regurgitated, as I considered the notion of 'murder as salvation'. It seemed like a cruel joke. I made it about a week, before a nightmare brought about the inevitable conclusion. A dream made me kill her. I dreamt of slithering into her room, a snake in human form, sliding along the floor, creeping into her bed, moving between her legs and consuming her, before I woke up. 

How could I prevent that which appeared inevitable?

One day, Calliope appeared in the darkness. She crept into my room. I acted as if I was sleeping, as she snuck into my bed. I felt her warm, naked body pressing against me. She took my arm and put it over her. She moved her body along mine and I felt my body go hard. Everything tightened. I fought the urges inside me, as she kissed along my hand and up my arm. She pulled me closer, as I slid inside her. My hand wrapped around her throat, gently at first, before the impulse took over. I didn't want to fuck her. I needed her death on my hands. All she wanted was to love, to be loved, something so normal and human that it pains me still to consider. 

I could never be that person. Killing her brought me no catharsis. What I saw in her eyes... I'd rather not say. I buried her body in a field far removed from civilization. I decorated her in rose petals.

It took a while after that for the urge to return. I knew it hadn't died, but subtly slid beneath the surface of my shame. I could feel it hiding inside me, like a splinter sinking deeper into my flesh. When it returned, it was like nothing I'd ever felt. It returned in a wave of anger and I saw my next victim walk in front of me. He carried himself with such superiority, much too much grace in his steps, as if he was lifting off the ground. Sin is easy enough to see when you know how to look. Its your perception of the world that allows you to either acknowledge or ignore the truth. He thought he wasnt a man, but the supreme ruler of all the lands he surveyed. 

His death would have to be swift and brutal. The rage that overwhelmed me would have it no other way. For that, I had the axe. There's nothing to send more of a message than killing a man with an axe. A knife shows comfort with the human form. An axe is used if you want to destroy a man's name. The axe is a guarantee of blood spraying everywhere, mangled bits of flesh, torn organs shredded beyond repair and the disbelief of any solidarity in the essence of our human forms. 

I followed him to a bar, where he met a group of friends. He was drunk within an hour. He wore a Brutasche cloth, Armani suit with a blue Harvard tie, Elijah Rucco cufflinks and black, Italian leather shoes. His hair was slick, so were his eyes. His friends looked almost identical to him and I remember thinking that I could kill any one of them and it wouldn't matter. A few family members might care, but not me and not the world. 

Hours passed with no end in sight. I thought to give up and left the bar. After a few minutes, they stumbled out of the bar, yelling at the bouncer who blocked their return. They called a cab, but out of some instance of divine intervention, one of the friends turned on him out of some swelling sense of drunken rage. They stood a few feet away from the cab. The friend said something and the man reacted by punching him in the stomach. A few of the others climbed out of the cab and broke it up, but they all turned on him. They pushed him out of the way, cussing and yelling, as they took off in the taxi. He got up and yelled at the taxi, which drove down the street, before walking in the opposite direction.

The axe is... I don't want to say the 'funnest' way to kill a person, but... it provides such an atavistic rush to the proceedings... it desensitizes you. It's so brutal that it sends at least a thunderous jolt, punitive recoil of dark energy into all who use it. Nothing can compare to the rush of slamming cold steel down, splitting a man's skull in two and jamming your foot into his rib cage, so you can yank it out and do it again. 

I followed him a few blocks, before the perfect moment appeared before me. He stumbled right into a trap, falling over the side of the road and into oncoming traffic. A taxi nearly ran him down, but he stumbled instead over to the curb, where he sat. I came over, as any good samaritan, jogging over before anyone else could claim such a simple victory. I spoke loud enough that everyone around, not that there were many at such a late hour, knew I was there to help. I made the declaration clear that we were getting a cab and I was taking him home. I told him hed need to rest it off. We went to an apartment in an undesirable neighborhood. I tied him to a radiator and split his rib cage with the axe. The explosion on impact sprayed crimson in my eyes and I felt blessed, baptized by the blood of the depraved. It wasnt God, but the imminent, doomed, savage beasts, sons of the antichrist. My eyes couldnt adjust. I saw hell, demons within the pit of my soul chewing on veins, tugging strings to make my heart rancid so it could spew noxious fumes into the universe. I struck with the axe over and over. It takes its toll on your arms and shoulders. I was out of breath by the time I stopped and then, I had to, because there was nothing left of him. 

The bloody mess of a man, well, did he deserve my wrath? I have to ask, because its perspective that I desire more than anything. I felt Calliopes aftermath, something destructive pulsing inside of me that had to make its way out. This was fate. It was going to happen. This unlucky bastard was caught in the crossfire of my savage impulse and my rancid, overfed emotions.

Women are much better liars than men, because, as we all must learn, it isn't a lie if you believe what you say. Men are full of shit. Everyone knows it. It's gotten to the point where everyone just assumes that everything anyone says is a downright lie, which, basically, I guess it is. Nobody is concerned about truth. Killing people won't help, but if I can be truthful here... who knows. Men have this instant tell in their eyes when they lie. The clouds can't hold together and the pupil withers, fading into that fathomless ocean of white, like a drop of rain. There's something in that release, as a man realizes he's lost to a simple push of metal into his flesh. I twist the blade and he winces, his right eye shutters and the left becomes much more pronounced with an incalculable clarity. 

Men make you wonder what they see when they die, because, in all their horror, they don't really know. When women die, it's almost as if they're saying goodbye. Women never lie. They assume a truth that's reasonable and go with it. I've found it much easier to murder women. I've always found it easier to talk to women. I adore women, but not in some mean-spirited, warped idolatry. One who would refuse to examine the elements of their rhetoric for a while would think that women only want to talk about themselves. The truth of the matter is that women want to examine their own sources. They want to relax and accept their truths. If you approach a woman on a difficult subject, something she doesn't want to talk about, something personal or just anything that might detract from her standing with a certain crowd, she won't lie, but she won't deny her own reality. She'll fight to protect it and allow her beliefs to coincide with parallel realities.

Women play the strongest game of mental gymnastics. When they die, it's like they're being set free and all the weight of their sin carries over into a forgiving, appreciative afterlife. I love setting them free. Women's eyes shine brighter when they die. They know so much. The deepest wisdom of their fragile spirits escapes for mere fractions of a second, before collapsing, folding and then disappearing forever. It takes no time at all for them to accept fate. Their pupils push back against the sea of white, like the petals of a rose unfolding to reveal something so beautiful and pure you pray to God you can touch it. In less than a moment, the petals wither and that which once mesmerized is destined to crumble. Somewhere in her eyes the truth is buried. I see it with every victim. I think that's why I hope to continue, because I'm convinced there's a deeper truth and understanding in her eyes. 

I found that using the axe to murder was like using a tactical nuclear device to get rid of an infestation of ants. It was so much overkill that I had to rest for hours and then days. The rush of dark energy flowing through my body was like some cancerous parasite coursing through my veins. It took some time to be rid of the parasite, but after, I felt numb and useless. I felt like a husk, a shell of a man, until I saw her. 

Rosanna was a beautiful young girl, blonde hair, 54, just over one-hundred pounds, but the weight went to all the right places. The symmetry of her face was calculated and hypnotic. I pictured Cleopatra when I looked into her eyes. She was young, cunning and ambitious. She looked in my direction, as another predator, but we were hunting different things. She made the mistake of making the first move, before knowing my convictions. I had to be careful not to do the same. 

Murder is meant to be done with a knife. Preference must become a factor, I understand, but because of who I am as a person, I repeat: Murder is meant to be done with a knife. A gun is so impersonal. Greedy governments use guns. A knife is pure. Poets kill with a knife. A knife is a blessing. I like to imagine that a shaman or priest has blessed it with the ability to send everyone I kill straight to heaven. No matter the truth, I love the effect it has on the people I set free. Their immediate sense is horror, but once its inside they get the point. It all makes sense and then means absolutely nothing. 

Rosanna was a different kind of victim than Calliope. She showed such strength on the outside, but inside inside she showed such affection, remorse and overwhelming humanity. She lived alone in a shitty apartment that she kept together nicely. Everything was a project for her. She enjoyed the muck of her life. It left her room for improvement. Projects were all she needed. Rosanna liked to be kept busy. We fucked in her bedroom, recently painted bright purple and a broken door that wouldnt close. It took a few weeks before I could kill her. The sex was too much for me to get away. I enjoy sex, masturbation and fantasy, but her attraction her pull that warped, incessant desire was difficult for me to ignore. She had a demon inside her that fed on every forced penetration. Every moment that her body shuddered I felt its presence. Every time I saw her orgasm it was the demon unfolding so that it might escape. 

It was out of terror that I killed her. It wasnt on purpose. I saw the demon, as we climaxed together. My hands wrapped around her throat. She wrapped her hands around my face, grabbing my cheeks and pressing her nails into the delicate tissue. She cut a jagged line across my face, but thought we were still having sex. Rosanna moved her hips more, as her hands went to my throat. My hands remained on hers as well, as my penis remained hard as a rock. We made love again, as I tried to kill her. When she finally felt the crushing touch of my fingers, as they pressed harder and harder, siphoning that last bit of air before the panic became too real, it was too late. 

Women are life. Men are death. A female praying mantis will eat her mate after sex. Blame survival. A man will eat his young. A woman has a sense of what it is to be alive. Her young are her trophies. Theyre a victory for surviving. It's only natural that a mother would want the world to see her trophies, as they carry her sin into the future. Our perception of the female of this species is whats leading to our extinction. Theyve somehow become the archetype for grace, civility and beauty, when theyre so much more. Women are the survivors and judicators. They determine if our species will further itself into the distant future or wither into an abominable nothing. 

Killing women meant the death of this species. 

I work for a law firm as what is known as an Examinating Representative Consultant. I dont even know what that means. Basically, my company helps greasy old billionaires remain obnoxious rich, as desperate, under-represented businesses try to fight back. I despise these old monsters. Theyll be the death of this species. Grimy old businessmen will be the extinction of the human race. I can see it in their eyes. Theyre cold not calculating its just the direction of their thoughts. They only think in greed. I remember one time we had to deliver the news to one of these old misers that his workers in one South American country went on strike. The look of relief on his face is something Ill never forget. He made it clear that his company would be moving on without them and to make it clear to these former workers that their services were no longer needed. It was basically an army that he sent to deliver the message. Five people died, two women. Governments and degenerate businessmen use guns so impersonal. 

Now, the problem with telling the rest of my story is that a huge gap exists in my memory of five through ten. I get confused, because they all looked the same. They acted and sounded the same. Their thoughts and emotions, even their eyes I felt like I was killing the same person over and over.

One of them was a dog groomer. She spoke for hours about dogs. She loved them. When I made a joke about her fucking dogs because she loved them so much, she went on about her perception of love. It threw me off that she didnt get offended. She stopped and laughed. Good joke. We went from dinner to her place. She had paintings of dogs on her walls, but didnt keep pets. She thought people shouldnt keep animals as pets. She believed that life was sacred. 

She knew right away that I was no good. She thought she could help me. She was a beautiful angel girl. I killed her five times. The other four Ill have to know better in the afterlife. My hands scorched with the fires of hell when I touched her that last time. I wrapped my hands around her throat and felt the fire pulling me into her. She was a messenger of God, a gypsy spirit sent to claim my soul. The devil had plans for me in the afterlife. Fear and flames overwhelmed me. She was dead by the time I woke up. There wasnt enough to be said about her. She was a loving, nurturing woman. I hope theres a better place for such a girl. She belongs beyond this world, where old, degenerate scumbags make the rules because of a few billion dollars. 

The other four I have yet to piece together. Ive tried to remember, but its like a blockage in my mind. I reach this barrier and cannot move forward. I took a moment to consider that the dementia was seeping further into my mind and that maybe it was time I sought professional assistance. Instead, I went to Calliope. I drove several hours to where Id buried her, a place outside the city, where shed be safe. The problem was that Calliope disappeared. There were no signs of any grave ever being in this place. I searched for hours thinking Id made a mistake and her body was somewhere else, only to be left wanting. 

Michelle. Twenty-two. Pharmacist. Light-brown roots showing through blonde-colored hair. Smile that could light up a room. The knife did her in, but my hands were definitely around her throat. I could hear a saxophone playing somewhere in the room. Was it a room or some indeterminable dimension in hell, for which well never escape? Ill kill her over and over again, without remorse, without a hope for improvement. She sang something so sweet in her dying breath. It sounded like a plea for mercy, but came out as a rallying cry. The world could understand her. It listened. She cried for them to hear, as the light faded from her eyes. 

The words were so powerful that I listened. I abandoned her in her apartment and ran home. Realizing that Id left so much evidence of my crimes, I went back. There were no signs of anything. The apartment was run-down, walls sinking with cracked paint, ceiling collapsing with rain damage, busted boards with sharp nails ready to snag loose flesh from your legs. I stepped back from that apartment and never returned. 

That's part of my confession you see... Im in need of assistance. I cant explain the extent of my sin, because there are no more boundaries. Ive committed the ultimate sin somewhere along the lines. Ive desecrated too many of Gods creatures to ever go back to that brilliant light of purity and justice. I noticed a man's sin the other day just by looking in his eyes. Your eyes are just... perfect vessels of wisdom and truth. If you haven't ever looked into your own eyes in a mirror you're ignoring a deeper understanding of the self. Look into your eyes and think about the worst thing you've ever done. Wait until you see those dark clouds in your pupils. Theyll recede to allow you to see the truth in your soul. 

I love seeing the truth in mine. I'm a homicidal maniac. I love murder and fantasize about rape. It's funny I never knew I was a 'bad guy', until I killed Travis. I used to fantasize about rape and lie about who I am as a person. Then, I never thought I'd commit murder. Then... I guess I never thought I'd lose control and live my life as a machine, committing violent, calculated attacks over and over again. 

I know the truth. I know what's right. I choose to do otherwise. I guess I've always known that I was evil, although I never knew I was a killer. It started with the rape fantasy. I've fantasized about it since I was a teenager. I know why. I love control. I love the forced removal of clothing, so I can break you down, until you're nearly exposed. I get to see you at your most vulnerable. I make you stand in front of me in your bra and panties and let my hands slide all over your body. I let you see the knife, so I can see the truth in your eyes. The soul reveals itself through the revelation of your darkest fears. I assume the role of abominable nightmare, until the sight is so overwhelming your senses collapse and everything goes numb. 

I remember the first time I went numb. I made the mistake of watching the "news". Society is full of 'important' people and the 'oh so gosh golly holier than thou' are the ones that watch the news. I think the technology came on faster than we knew. We weren't ready to deal with it. In a few decades, we'll either have a handle on it or it will have come to consume our corpse. My mind wasn't ready for it. There's so much going on around the world and there's nothing you can do about it. I think at the time the U.S. had undergone a military operation in Somalia. The Somalis killed a man with a machete on live television, but all we saw was the assailants arm rising with the weapon, before the camera pulled away. I remember thinking 'where did they go?' I couldn't answer. I cried so hard. I tried to calm down, but I couldn't. I wanted a peaceful, orderly universe and the news disrupted my worldview with a cacophony of jarbled, incongruous messages, spliced with PG-13 violence and commercials for Coca-Cola.

Brenda a prototype of the New Free-Love Generation. She was a drifting hippie, whose caravan of seekers found themselves abandoned off the side of the interstate. Wait Brenda was in the trunk no Celia was in the trunk. She was either number eight or it must be seven. I dragged Celia behind a nightclub downtown. The knife went into her flesh with such ease. She spit blood in my face. The fires of hell consumed me. I stabbed her over and over, before the fires settled and I stopped seeing red. She whimpered, as she dragged her bleeding frame along the filthy alley. 

I took her body on a roadtrip, thinking I would find some peace in burying another of my victims in the countryside. I shouldve stopped, when I realized this is where I belong. Brenda needed a ride. Unfortunately, two of her friends snuck into the back seats of my car. I think the thought was to kill Brenda, because I thought it would be fitting. She reminded me a lot of Calliope. They couldve shared some spirit, a vital essence that sprung forth from the heavens to bring purity and joy into the world. Why did I feel the need to stifle such a positive energy? 

Parasiticus Ominus. Its this parasite that goes from host to host spreading all the most vile and depraved of emotions. Its responsible for the Holocaust, Hiroshima, genocides, plagues, famines, mass corporate greed, racism all that good stuff. There are good parasites and bad ones that science just now understands. In the future, therell be beacons, like there are for radio waves. These ones will propagate good bacteria, while stifling the bad. For now, you have to trust your instincts. They flow from your gut, which is riddled with bacteria. 

No wait I killed Brenda and her two friends. The hammer. One of her friends in the backseat found a hammer. She thought nothing of it. Hammer of the Gods. The hammer hadnt been used for anything insidious, but when she handed it to me I smashed it into Brendas face. It struck right in her teeth. Everyone screamed in shock and terror, including Brenda. Her cries echoed through her shattered teeth. I drove faster, slamming my foot against the pedal, before crashing into a ditch. Her two friends flew through the windshield. Brenda survived, but didnt make it far. She crawled along the warm pavement, leaving a trail of blood to the scene of the crime. I climbed over her. One swing of the hammer and I felt the recoil, as it cracked her skull. Her face smashed against the concrete, already broken from the previous strike in the car, as her body convulsed. The sight of her convulsions terrified me. I wanted nothing more than to end it. I slammed the hammer over and over, until she stopped. 

The hammer is a weapon I would highly recommend, if only for its efficiency. You can carry it anywhere and use it as much as you please without impossible strength or stamina. An axe is much more work. You have to drag it over your head to provide enough force to break through the flesh and body, and then pull it out to do it all over. A hammer beats its target, breaks it down, shatters, and pulverizes. The hammer remains the same, while the victim becomes unrecognizable. 

There was a time when Id look for a victim, but the hunt is so much more enduring. Its in our myths, although its so much more. Hunting is written in our D.N.A. Parasiticus Ominus fights for survival. He looks for the right victim. He measures, moderates, adjusts and hunts some more, so that he will find the victim whos perfect for his cause. What does he seek? How does he know when he finds it? These are the answers that elude me. Thats why I refuse to ask more questions. Its not worth knowing, unless I know completely. 

Nothing can compare to that perfect feeling of murder. The rush is a high that no drug will ever match. Its a religious experience. Murder doesnt come to us naturally at least I have trouble believing it does. We kill for survival. We kill baby pigs and chickens and cows, because they cant fight for themselves. If you cant defend yourself, a natural instinct kicks into the predator. You become his slave. This is the afterlife. My victims are chickens and pigs thrown into cages for the rest of their lives. Imagine how that baby pig sees his master? Im a walking nightmare. I approach their cages and feed them, not to sustain them, but to fatten them up, so theyll make me more money. Greed. Angel of Remorse, hear my demands for a return. 

My eleventh victim was a prostitute. I never paid for sex before, but it seemed like the easiest way to find my victim. Prostitutes are already victims. Pimps own them. Slavery is all around us in this country. The filth and greed of it. I set her free. We went around the corner to a dead-end. Decades of disrepair left the street full of vacant buildings. The world collapsed around me, decades of greed and corruption. America enters this final age. I brought a rope that she thought meant I wanted something kinky. Bondage. While it is a turn on, this was not my intention. My life is far too complicated for anything more, especially sexually. Im afraid Ill open a Pandoras Box, from which Ill never escape. The rope left red marks over her white flesh. I left her in a dumpster. 

Parasiticus Ominus possessed a rampant infection within himself. Our spirits became as one, not only when he committed such heinous atrocities, but also when he felt strong emotions for which he needed help understanding. He was a lot like me. I think he loved his victims. I think he loved the prostitute, because she was a part of him. His brothers, other strains of Parasiticus Ominus, were inside her. They fed her the fear and made her life a nightmare, before she came full circle. Parasiticus Ominus. She found the end of her road at its beginning. 

Bacteria deranged parasites with love in their heart flies that chew through the flesh of children in Africa they share warmth and desires like the rest of us. Were all chewing our way through this pile of shit we call life. Do you know what is Parasiticus Ominus deepest, darkest desire? He wants the ocean to be nothing more than a tub full of acid. If and when that happens Parasiticus will consume his brothers. He will ingest more and more, until hes grown to such volume that he explodes from his cocoon and becomes the dreaded beast of apocalyptic lore. The myths and predilections of our ancestors were nothing more than fever dreams brought on by Parasiticus Ominus. Religion is a lie. Faith is meant to make him. 

I had a tub of acid in an apartment in a less than desirable neighborhood. I used it to carve up bodies from time to time, but for the most part I buried my victims in tact. Its when I thought people would take extra care in finding them that I used such precautions. 

Deborah wouldve been my last victim, if not for her bitchy, overly determined sister, Diana. They were both beautiful, but Deborah was the easiest to fool with simple sincerity. Most women fall for sincerity. It feeds into the lies they tell themselves. Deborah saw the best in me. Diana saw the worst. They were both right. I killed Deborah with a knife. We were at my apartment. I stabbed her over and over and not a moment later Diana knocked at my door. I dragged Deborah into a closet. Diana demanded to see her sister, but I told her I hadnt seen Deborah in a few days. She knew that was an immediate lie. It was the last time I used the hammer. I swung it and missed. Diana made a break for the door. I chased her out of the apartment and grabbed the back of her jacket. She fought me. I panicked and pushed her over the balcony. She fell several stories and cracked her neck. 

There was no escape. Someone must have heard. I shut the door and hid, but realized Deborah was still rotting in the closet. I heard a knocking at the closet door and the knob turned. Deborah could barely reach it, but tried to twist with her bloodied fingers. I left her and ran to gather up the broken mess of her sister. I looked over the balcony with the several supplies Id gathered to clean the mess, but she was gone. 

Nothing remained of the occurrence. There were no signs of her or anyone for that matter. Something happened. I had neighbors, but none of them would answer their doors. I went screaming down the halls, but there was no one there. 

I ran down the stairs and out into the streets, where I saw the name of the building written in stone, 'Matrix Agynsta Industrial Complex'. Windows were boarded up. Dust collected over the pile of concrete that stood before me. I was alone in the universe. This was hell. Id been convicted by a tribunal, not of peers, but gods who walk among us. They identified the strain, Parasiticus Ominus, and decided to detach it, dislodge it from the defiled corpse of the human race. 

This is where I belong. Im at peace. Whether you believe this confession I really dont care. Ive said all I had to say. Ive confessed to the most abhorrent compunction of my soul. This is my truth take it or leave it. </TEXT>
