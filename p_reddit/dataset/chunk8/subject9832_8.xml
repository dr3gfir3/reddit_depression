	<TEXT> The Detective taps the pen, then begins writing in the yellow notebook. "How long did you work?"

Sparkle laughs, "Hundreds of years. We started work as soon as the sun made it's first appearance in the arctic sky, and long after it set and the moon would shine sheets of light onto the snow below." 

"So, you would work all day?"

"Yeah, all day. Every hour our little hands were busy assembling, reading instructions. You see, we didn't make the toys. That's all bullshit. Santa has a guy in all the counties. They buy the product. Then they move the product fast, too. Nobody ever asks about toys...man, I wish some days, just one day, someone would ask, "Hey, where are these toys going?" just maybe to end this enduring hell..."

"You put together toys?"

Sparkle takes another drag from his cigarette, staring at the wall off to his right. "Yeah, we put together toys. Can you imagine assembling billions of toys for Billions of children? Can you? We worked in lines, but we had to work fast, very fast. Master elves would walk down our line, watching us closely. If we stopped for just a second.." Sparkle pauses, swallowing, "I saw a lot of good elves die, you know? They didn't have to, all they wanted was water...just a small cup.."

"Where was Santa when this was all this was a happening?"

Sparkle moves his head side to side, stretching his neck. "He watched from his office. If I had the chance though, just to take one of these small screwdrivers and go up there and shove it into both of his eyes, over, and over again. It would be so worth my death. But, Death is an easy escape."

"How did you get out?"

"We we're expected a shipment of Ipads and Iphones. I made my way up the ranks through the years, and one of the master elves was on the radio trying to coordinate with the drop. And he turned his back, and every fiber of my being said run, and I didn't even hesitate. I moved as fast as my small legs could carry me. I ran and I ran. And they searched for me too. The worst part was digging out the tracking device they have implanted when they first catch you then send you off to work." Sparkle lifts his shirt up, showing his small,pale bare chest. And in the center of his breast a deep red scar. "I had to dig the device out with a stick. With a fucking stick.." He shakes his head. "I can go on for years and years what I've been through, man. I'm tired. Is it possible if I can catch a nap for a couple days? Maybe if you guys have some hot chocolate you can spare? I can tell you everything..."

"Yeah kid," The detective says, "Sure thing."

The detective walks out of the room, into the room next door. He walks up to the two way mirror, staring at Sprinkles with his arms crossed. 

"So he's lying?" The detective asks. 

Behind the detective he hears a jolly laugh, and then a large man stands, moving over and next to the detective. Holding his own arms close to his chest, using his right hand to stroke his gigantic white and fluffy beard. 

"Sprinkles was always a liar," the giant man says, "He wants to ruin Christmas, you see? I'm glad you guys picked him up. I'll give you half you money now, and as soon as we get him back up north, I'll wire transfer the rest."

The detective smiles, and shakes the big man's hand. "Alright, I'll set it up."

The detective begins to leave the room, opening the door. 

"Hey Detective," The big man says. 

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for doing this, you understanding what you're doing, you know?"

"Yeah Santa," The detective says, smiling, nodding his head, "I'm helping you save Christmas. We'll talk soon."

The detective leaves, closing the door.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "I know this is hard to understand," Dr. Goodman said, leaning back into his chair, setting the folder down on top of his desk. "But this is what we need to do." 

"I don't--" Leah said. She stood by the door, folding her arms. "You can't do anything?" 

"We can, I can.. " Goodman said leaning forward, "But, what it's going to take from me. It's too much." 

"Too much?"

Dr. Goodman leaned forward, opening the folder, "These X-rays, we have no other choice but to amputate. We have to cut off the leg at the thigh, if we don't it will continue to spread, and--" Goodman paused, collecting himself. "You understand these talks are never easy?"

"Yes. I do, I do."

"To put it bluntly, you can't afford my pain, I'm sorry. I know it sounds terrible, I know. But it's the truth. It's too much for me to bare if your insurance can't cover it."

Leah moved from the door to the desk, setting her arms down, "I'm sure there's something you can do. Something, anything?"

Goodman crossed his arms, shaking his head. "No, your insurance doesn't cover the cost. I'm sorry, but the pain will be too much and I charge what I charge due to my skills and experience dealing with these types of situations. I say no, often. This isn't just you. If I didn't have to feel every inch of that blade... " Goodman paused, looking out the window, then back to Leah, "It's too much. I'm sorry Leah.. I'm really sorry." Goodman took off his glasses, setting them on the table. 

Leah folded her arms again, nodding her head. "Thank you doctor...I.. I understand, completely. " She turned, opened the door, and closed it softly. 

She moved down the hallway, passed nurses who smiled meekly, and she smiled back. She walked back into the waiting room. Her eyes scanned the seats until she saw her. 

Leah moved over, smiling, "Hey sweetie." 

"Hi, Mommy!" The little girl smiled, the front two teeth missing. She set down the her crayon on top of the coloring book. "Did you talk to the doctor?"

Lesh kneeled down, placing her hand on her daughter's knee. "Yes, honey..." Leah took a deep breath, exhaling softly. "Sweetie, I have some bad news..."

	<TEXT> Thought I share a conversation I just had with myself. 

6000 words in and telling the entire story from a 3rd person perspective. And I went over my last sentence, thinking, *"Man, I should have just written this in 1st person. I've had way more fun in the past with that, I can get into my protagonist's head more, show the audience what he's thinking. But, damn it, I'm already 6000 words in, that means that I have to rewrite what I written, ah man, that's going to take forev...wait, no I don't. I can just keep going, and just start writing in 1st person because this is the first draft. It doesn't matter. Have fun and get the words done."*

Thought I would share this with you kids if you just had the same problem I just had. I don't know if this is a good or bad idea, but it's helping me stay motivated because I was falling asleep at the keyboard before this thought invaded my mind.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They used to have to carve shit into walls if they wanted anything remembered.

I'm same here with a cheap ass laptop that I could STILL barely afford, but I just shut my trap and write. That's all that matters. Unless a keyboard came with teeth and tried to bite you every time you tried to get some words out, yeah, you would have a point.  </TEXT>
