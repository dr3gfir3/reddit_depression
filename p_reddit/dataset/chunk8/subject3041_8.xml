	<TEXT> Yeah I don't understand the whole "only band wagoners would go to the pirates subreddit and downvote them."

I don't really think band wagoners care enough to go and trash talk on a different subreddit. Most of those people in the Pirates subreddit are probably huge Cubs fans who have been watching every game since they were kids.

There is no correlation between "loyal fan" and "being a good sport." </TEXT>
