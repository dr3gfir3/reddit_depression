	<TEXT> There is a raging war in Afghanistan and the Taliban are closing on Kabul. The dumbshit yankees were warned that this will happen when after 9/11 they started the offensive against their own proxies they used in the war against the Soviets. And they were warned by no one else but the military experts of Russia. The bottom line is over 3000 US military dead and counting plus hundreds of millions if not more thrown down the drain. The Afghanis flood Europe because they can settle and receive political asylum although all of them are economic migrants abusing the misguided EU criteria for granting political asylum. The main problem in this case, as with the Iraqis and the Syrians, is that those immigrants belong to the Wahhabi/Salafi Sunni Muslims (read Al Qaeda/ISIS) and they are the one that are radical and Sharia-minded. So briefly, trouble is ahead for the EU but that was the whole idea of the schadenfreude from beyond the pond i.e. the US, expressed unwittingly by the dumbshit former US Asst SoS Nuland in a different situation as "Fuck the EU!".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's all theatrics. He most likely knows it wasn't Assad and it was all another White Helmets Hollywood show (If you want me will link a "witness video" with the dead kids where one "dead" kid couldn't wait the shoot to end and opened its eye) but he's getting in deep shit here and taking a blow after a blow - with his executive orders, with his staff appointments, almost on all fronts. So he had no choice but show some balls, which in fact is just a dick waving, 'cause you understand that if they warned us the airfield was cleared from military staff and working equipment ASAP and they left just things that can't be moved as hangars and  fuel silos and some malfunctioning equipment. So it's much ado about nothing but the US population will get the message that he's a tough guy though he's just another talking head and the next idiot in US politics. To be fair, I expected quite a bit more from him. Never liked him and clearly saw he is a clown. Same with the other witch bitch - HRC, a hyper-disgusting person though talking reasonably if we exclude her warmongering which is the biggest NO NO in my book.

PS. It wasn't Assad fo sho. The US just dropped the idea of regime change in the UN. The declaration blaming the regime was postponed too. The attack was by SAA Su-22 which can carry just standard missiles which CANNOT be retrofitted to carry gas canisters (such attack could be carried only by choppers and barrel bombs). If you have paid attention no one ever showed any bomb shrapnels with traces of chemicals as evidence (and there should be enough of those). Also you don't handle sarin attack victims without gloves as shown by the AQ Helmets. Two Turkish MPs made a statement Turkey provided the terrorists with sarin. The source could be Libya, Iraq or KSA too as the CIA planned such provocations to justify the regime change and as Carla Del Ponte, the chairman of the UN commission, investigating such attacks in the past (2013), mentioned in an interview the evidence collected leads to the terrorists. Also J. Kerry, in front of the UN, stated back in 2014 that the last batch of chemical materials that could be used in chemical weapons and belonging to the Assad Govt was disposed of back then. Assad is winning the war and there was no justifiable reason to tarnish his name in such a senseless way unless s/o thinks he's an idiot, which he def is not.

	<TEXT> Everyone knows that it was your country and the US who supplied the terrorists with sarin as J. Kerry and the State Dept noted back in 2014 that the last cache of chemical materials that could be used for weapons, Syria/Assad had, was deposed of. However the two Turkish MPs in the permalink claim that Turkey provided the terrorists with such. I see how hard you are selling the Erdogan line "we support the terrorists because they are radical Sunnis" but it's a no go i.e. strictly for the birds. Can't handle the truth, uh? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Everyone except Putin and Assad determined the previous attack came from Syrian stockpiles and/or was carried out by Assad.

Total BS. **Here's Carla Del Ponte, a chairman of the UN commission, charged with investigating the use of chemical weapons. She clearly states that the terrorists, which Turkey, KSA, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and the US support DID the previous attacks, namely the one in Ghouta**: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22424188

	<TEXT> No, if it wasn't true then there would be bomb shrapnels with traces of the chemical used paraded on the MSM. And if it wasn't true some "expert" should explain and show how a SAA Su-22 could shoot other than standard equipped missiles (which can NOT be retrofitted to carry gas containers). And if it wasn't true then [Turkish MPs wouldn't claim that the gas was provided by Turkey to the terrorists which has happened in the past too in similar cases](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/sarin-gas-materials-sent-to-isis-from-turkey-claims-mp-eren-erdem-34286662.html).

	<TEXT> Couple of more studies challenge the 'obesity paradox' lately. Paradoxically, for some, smoking status has been considered as an effect modifier (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5353321/):

Conclusions: In this cohort, the obesity paradox is
mainly explained by smoking as an effect modifier.
These findings indicate that the obesity paradox does
not challenge standard weight management
recommendations among T2D patients.
