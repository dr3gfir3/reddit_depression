	<TEXT> See I think this would be a smart way of going about it! That way they'd side step any comparisons to the original but they'd also build up the mythos that the UK series created.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know. I'm conflicted. I know it's HBO, but given the way many UK to US adaptations go, it feels a bit iffy. Maybe if Dennis Kelly (the creator) were on board along with Fincher and Flynn, I'd feel a lot better if this does happen. Because then we'd know that they're making an effort to honour the spirit of the original series, even if they're probably remaking it but set in the States.  </TEXT>
