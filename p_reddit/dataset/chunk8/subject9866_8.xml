	<TEXT> [Jurnal article link.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X17300638)

**Highlights**

* We estimate lunar core composition using geochemical constraints.
* We determine phase equilibria for three compositions in FeNiSC system.
* A low S and C core has a high temperature liquidus but remains partially molten over lunar history.
* A core with 0.5 wt% S and 0.375 wt% C might provide an explanation for lunar paleomagnetic and seismic data.
* Core composition is consistent with available geochemical and geophysical data.

**Abstract**

Multiple lines of geochemical and geophysical evidence suggest the Moon has a small metallic core, yet the composition of the core is poorly constrained. The physical state of the core (now or in the past) depends on detailed knowledge of its composition, and unfortunately, there is little available data on relevant multicomponent systems (i.e., FeNiSC) at lunar interior conditions. In particular, there is a dearth of phase equilibrium data to elucidate whether a specific core composition could help to explain an early lunar geodynamo and magnetic field intensities, or current solid inner core/liquid outer core states. We utilize geochemical information to estimate the Ni, S and C contents of the lunar core, and then carry out phase equilibria experiments on several possible core compositions at the pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the lunar interior. The first composition is 0.5 wt% S and 0.375 wt% C, based on S and C contents of Apollo glasses. A second composition contains 1 wt% each of S and C, and assumes that the lunar mantle experienced degassing of up to 50% of its S and C. Finally a third composition contains C as the dominant light element. Phase equilibrium experiments were completed at 1, 3 and 5 GPa, using piston cylinder and multi-anvil techniques. The first composition has a liquidus near 1550C and solidus near 1250C. The second composition has a narrower liquidus and solidus temperatures of 1400 and 1270C, respectively, while the third composition is molten down to 1150C. As the composition crystallizes, the residual liquid becomes enriched in S and C, but S enrichment is greater due to the incorporation of C (but not S) into solid metallic FeNi. Comparison of these results to thermal models for the Moon allow an evaluation of which composition is consistent with the geophysical data of an early dynamo and a currently solid inner and liquid outer core. Composition 1 has a high enough liquidus to start crystallizing early in lunar history (4.3 Ga), consistent with the possible core dynamo initiated by crystallization of a solid inner core. Composition 1 also stays partially molten throughout lunar history, and could easily explain the seismic data. Composition 2, on the other hand, can satisfy one or the other set of geophysical data, but not both and thus seems like a poor candidate for a lunar core composition. Composition 3 remains molten to temperatures that are lower than current estimates for the lunar core, thus ruling out the possibility of a C-rich (and S-poor) lunar core. The S- and C-poor core composition studied here (composition 1) is consistent with all available geochemical and geophysical data and provides a simple heat source and mechanism for a lunar core dynamo (core crystallization) that would obviate the need for other primary mechanisms such as impacts, coremantle coupling, or unusual thermal histories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've posted this before here, but in case some folks missed it.

He did a great job with what he was given. He didn't want to act Vader the way Lucas wanted him to.
Taken from the book "The Complete Vader":

However Christensen soon expressed dismay over certain aspects of the Episode II screenplay. In a 2005 Rolling Stone interview, Lucas recalled, "[Christensen] said, 'I don't want to be this whiny kid.' I said, 'Well you are. You gotta be a whiny teenager.' He said, 'I want to be Darth Vader.' I said, 'You gotta be a petulant young Jedi. You're not going to be the guy you thought you'd be when you signed your contract.'

There's another paragraph I remember reading, but can't find, where Hayden mentioned he wanted to bring that seriousness and darkness out in Anakin and Lucas fought him on that too preferring the whiny teen angst angle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This behavior is so odd because normally octopuses are pouncers.

According to Dr. Roy Caldwell at U.C. Berkeley who studies this species:

Octopuses typically pounce on their prey or poke around in holes until they find something. When this octopus sees a shrimp at a distance, it compresses itself and creeps up, extends an arm up and over the shrimp, touches it on the far side and either catches it or scares it into its other arms.

For more information please see Berkeley's press release [here](http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/08/12/octopus-shows-unique-hunting-social-and-sexual-behavior/).

I love cephalopods in general and have commented on them many times before. They are incredibly fascinating animals and their camouflage is amazing which we don't see much of in this gif, but I've talked about ti before in other posts.

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_squid)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

More on that in [this Scientific American article](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/how-the-octopus-creates-instant-3-d-camouflage-on-its-skin/).

	<TEXT> Ecologist climbing in! These are [Spurelli's leaf frogs or gliding tree frogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding_tree_frog) (*Agalychnis spurrelli*) as the gif states. 

I see the video is a .ch, so taken in Switzerland which does not have tree frogs of this species. Gliding tree frogs are found in Central America and northern areas of South America. 

While I am not familiar with this species specifically, I know [wood frogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_frog) (*Lithobates sylvaticus*) have some [pretty serious orgies](http://gizmodo.com/wood-frog-mating-is-a-competitive-watery-orgy-1704284178) when they come out of hibernation. Other species of tropical tree frog also gather together as males scramble to find females. There was a Planet Earth episode on a species of flying tree frogs that showed this that Snoop Dogg [did some commentary on for Plizzanet Earth](http://latenightfeud.com/video/plizzanet-earth-with-snoop-dogg-tree-frogs/). It was the [episode](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074tgb) on Jungles.

User Glazed_BEagle also mentioned the struggle male tree frogs have to find the highest spot in order to call for females. This is also a very likely scenario and I believe what's happening in the gif. I wish it wasn't so short! [Here's a video he provided.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxYPi8p8YYk). I completely forgot about this behavior, I'm getting old. :) So a big thank you to him.

As climate change dries out more areas that were once wet, amphibians are projected to suffer the greatest casualties. Frogs need moist environments to mate, lay their eggs and then for their tadpoles to progress into adults. Sir David Attenborough discusses their fragility in this video [*Rare frogs   endangered species*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lWQLd5U0g8). 

For more information, the US Forest Service has a great article [*Amphibians and Climate Change*](https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/topics/amphibians-and-climate-change).

To help you can look into amphibian conservation groups such as [Amphibians.org](http://www.amphibians.org/) or  the [Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project](http://amphibianrescue.org/). There are usually volunteer opportunities with your state and local conservation groups as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He did a great job with what he was given. He didn't want to act Vader the way Lucas wanted him to.

Taken from the book "The Complete Vader": 

However Christensen soon expressed dismay over certain aspects of the Episode II screenplay. In a 2005 Rolling Stone interview, Lucas recalled, "[Christensen] said, 'I don't want to be this whiny kid.' I said, 'Well you are. You gotta be a whiny teenager.' He said, 'I want to be Darth Vader.' I said, 'You gotta be a petulant young Jedi. You're not going to be the guy you thought you'd be when you signed your contract.'


There's another paragraph I remember reading, but can't find, where Hayden mentioned he wanted to bring that seriousness and darkness out in Anakin and Lucas fought him on that too preferring the whiny teen angst angle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was seriously an expression master. The guy did a wonderful job conveying every emotion - anger to amusement - clearly just by making a facial expression. He did the best he could with the poor writing. I loved him as Anakin and am so excited that he'll be returning the the Star Wars community by being present at Celebration.

He also didn't want to act the way Lucas made him. Taken from the book "The Complete Vader": 

However Christensen soon expressed dismay over certain aspects of the Episode II screenplay. In a 2005 Rolling Stone interview, Lucas recalled, "[Christensen] said, 'I don't want to be this whiny kid.' I said, 'Well you are. You gotta be a whiny teenager.' He said, 'I want to be Darth Vader.' I said, 'You gotta be a petulant young Jedi. You're not going to be the guy you thought you'd be when you signed your contract.'

There's another paragraph I remember reading, but can't find, where Hayden mentioned he wanted to bring that seriousness and darkness out in Anakin and Lucas fought him on that too preferring the whiny teen angst angle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one is reducing other species to feel more important. Please read the article links provided. The article specifically mentions territory, mating and predators. It didn't mention being social for an enjoyment aspect. Do fish enjoy being around each other? Yes, some species do, but in this context, that's not what's being discussed in the journal article or news article. Some fish have reduced stress levels when in groups. It's hard to know if this is really similar to our happiness. 

Frankly, it's offensive you would even say that. I'm an ecologist, I study animal behavior for a living. Non-human animals are fascinating and complex, no matter the species. I have great respect for the natural world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many animals are more social than most folks give them credit for. It's important to note humans are not special when it comes to wanting to be around each other or other species.

Also important to know that this article isn't necessarily saying the fish are being social or engaged with each other. The calls blend together like a terrestrial rainforest at dawn. All those birds are not singing to each other out of mutual enjoyment, but to claim territory, communicate predator locations or find a mate. This mostly says the coral reef is the rainforest and the fish are the birds of the reef system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! Absolutely. I plan on checking on them once a week for photos. Once eggs are laid which might take 2 weeks, it'll take around 6 weeks for them to hatch. It'll be tough to know when they lay, but they usually start in May.

The nest is close to a wooden foot bridge and easy to photograph without disturbing them. Hopefully, this is the nest they stay at, sometimes they make a few before deciding. I'll see what's up this coming week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist chomping in. Bush scissors, very creative! Piranha are some fairly serious fish, but not the monsters we usually think they are.

There are about 20 species of piranha and [many are actually pretty docile](https://msu.edu/~torresm2/piranhabehavior.html)! The aggressive species we usually think of is the [Red-bellied piranha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-bellied_piranha) (*Pygocentrus nattereri*) ([here's a photo of our friend](http://bransonswildworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Piranha.jpg)). Their bad reputation comes from the U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt who went on an expedition to South America in 1913. According to [the Smithsonian Institute](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/14-fun-facts-about-piranhas-180951948/) he said this about piranha:

They are the most ferocious fish in the world. Even the most formidable fish, the sharks or the barracudas, usually attack things smaller than themselves. But the piranhas habitually attack things much larger than themselves. They will snap a finger off a hand incautiously trailed in the water; they mutilate swimmersin every river town in Paraguay there are men who have been thus mutilated; they will rend and devour alive any wounded man or beast; for blood in the water excites them to madness. They will tear wounded wild fowl to pieces, and bite off the tails of big fish as they grow exhausted when fighting after being hooked.

[Mental Floss wrote](http://mentalfloss.com/article/50356/how-teddy-roosevelt-turned-piranhas-ferocious-maneaters) about the locals fancying the situation up for Teddy by demonstrating piranhas eating a cow carcass. They caught a bunch before he arrived, kept them in a tank without feeding them, then tossed a dead cow into the river.

All that being said they do have a pretty impressive bite force, National Geographic has [a video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIWdFDLBzbY) where they measure the bite force of one species.  Not something I'd want to trim any part of my body with! Gregory Erickson of Florida State University measured several bite forces in crocodilians and determined the most powerful bite recorded from a living animal belongs to the [saltwater crocodile](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/s/saltwater-crocodile/) (*Crocodylus porosus*) (as of 2012) with a bite force of 16,414N.

Continuing on that line of thought there is an extinct species of giant piranhas, *Megapiranha paranensis*that were up to 3ft (1m) long with an estimated bite force of 1,240-4,749N. All of this bite force information comes from a BBC news article you might like to read called [*One creature had a bite more powerful than any other*](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160817-one-creature-had-a-bite-more-powerful-than-any-other). It gives the bite force of several interesting species, including Great White sharks and Hyenas. </TEXT>

**Highlights**

* Unlike other taxa, cephalopods diversify their proteomes extensively by RNA editing
* Extensive recoding is specific to the behaviorally complex coleiods
* Unlike mammals, cephalopod recoding is evolutionarily conserved and often adaptive
* Transcriptome diversification comes at the expense of slowed-down genome evolution

**Summary**
RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and transcriptome plasticity highlights the importance of RNA recoding as a strategy for diversifying proteins, particularly those associated with neural function. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in. This is so adorable.

Dolphins are very intelligent and one of the few animals to pass the ["Mirror test"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test) which helps to determine if an animal is self-aware (important distinction, it can give a positive but not a negative. If an animal fails the test it does not necessarily mean it is not self-aware). The test was done on [Bottlenose Dolphins](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/bottlenose-dolphin/) and not this species, which looks like a [Dusky dolphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusky_dolphin) (*Lagenorhynchus obscurus*). Don't be fooled by the "smile", it's just the shape of the mouth and not an indicator of pleasure. [Here's the journal article](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5937.full?sid=418d7011-efc6-4c7f-b45c-3e35c1918e95) for the Bottlenose dolphin test.

Play is an important part of many animals' lives as it helps them develop skills that are important for survival in a safe and enjoyable way. Many, many species play and some are kind of surprising. Science News had a fun write-up about surprising animals [here](https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/five-surprising-animals-play). If you check out the article, I loved the crocodilian examples. 

Back to dolphins though! This guy or gal is ["Bow Riding"](http://www.dolphindock.com.au/behaviours/bow-riding/) or using the wave the boat creates as propulsion. This is very common, though that doesn't take away from how fun it looks no matter how many videos or gifs I've seen. :) Dolphins also sometimes play with whales! They'll hitch rides on the whale's back or the whale will lift the dolphin into the air. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC3AkGSigrA) explaining the behavior and a [news article about it](http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15712/20150718/dolphins-riding-whales-exactly-new.htm).

Another note on dolphins, which I'll never get over how amazing this is, is that some species have been documented having "names" or specific signature whistles all their own. Here is the [National Geographic article](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130722-dolphins-whistle-names-identity-animals-science/) and a quote about the study:

The research was performed by a group of scientists on a boat off eastern Scotland who joined up with a group of wild dolphins. When one of the dolphins announced itself with its signature whistlethe equivalent of "Joey!" for instancethe researchers recorded that sound.

Later, the team played that same "Joey!" call back to the dolphins, and a significant portion of the time, the dolphin they called Joey responded with the same callas if Joey was saying, "Yup, I'm here."

Nat Geo said the journal article was published in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, but I haven't been able to dig it up yet. I'll try to find it for those interested.

If you're into it, try /r/ScienceFacts a TIL for science. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beautiful photo! 

This beautiful bioluminescence is caused by [phytoplankton](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/phyto.html). There are two main classes of phytoplankton; [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate) and [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom). Dinoflagellates are our bioluminescent phytoplankton! A common species is the [*Noctiluca scintillans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctiluca_scintillans), commonly known as the sea tinkle (I know, it's adorable). [Here's what it looks like up close](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/64/94/e9/6494e9f7bab8586dccae2f15c44cc7e8.jpg).
The bioluminescence is produced throughout the cytoplasm by a [luciferin-luciferase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin#Dinoflagellate) reaction in organelles called [scintillons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate#Bioluminescence).  

As I am sure you know, some marine animals also bioluminesce! Common examples are:

*  the squid [*Abralia veranyi*](http://ocean.si.edu/sites/default/files/styles/blog_photo/public/photos/2.09_P08_G10_Abraliabigger.jpg?itok=KYQhDjVX)
* various species of [lantern fish](http://biolum.eemb.ucsb.edu/organism/pictures/myctophid1.jpg)
* [angler fish species](http://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/984/135/50544_1_1280x720_640x360_177552451962.jpg)
* [googly eyed glass squid](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm0f9j7AQA1qin08mo1_500.jpg) (*Teuthowenia pellucida*)
* [vampire squid](https://media.giphy.com/media/s62zb1ouMjHxK/giphy.gif) (*Vampyroteuthis infernalis*)
* many many jellyfish or jellies (both words are still used, obviously they are not fish); [*Aequorea victoria*](http://www.dmlim.net/img/aeq/RaskoffAequorea.jpg), [*Aurelia aurita*](https://1nlbgh367fhx33e65vxs7rl8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Moon-JellyFish.jpg), [*Bolinopsis infundibulum*](http://68.media.tumblr.com/312506db6d05e9ce8962a26f9bac91fd/tumblr_nviwvrGW1K1ue1k7zo1_1280.jpg), etc.
