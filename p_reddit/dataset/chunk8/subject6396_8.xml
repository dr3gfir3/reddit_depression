Don't forget to include the caveat that Europeans were still in the Americas at that time and they brought disease. Those diseases made contact with Natives before Europeans were physically in the region </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This year's annual Society for American Archaeology conference is over. It seemed as though a lot of people presented and attended, but there was something about it all that seemed lackluster. That isn't to say I didn't sit in on interesting sessions and symposiums, but it was missing a spark. This year I did a lot less running around than usual. Normally I am running from room to room to see different papers. This year I pretty much sat in on whole sessions and didn't move. That long sitting really put a kink in my back and left butt cheek. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could write about all sorts of things. You have their hours, you calculate their wages. Make a comparison of their wages to the standard of living at the time. This would inform you about socio-economic classes at the time which could, in turn, reveal more about local events. Poverty, after all, is a catalyst for crime and drug/alcohol abuse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That article discusses how the chicken remains are not Polynesian in origin, which refutes that line of evidence.

While sweet potatoes may have gone from South America to Polynesia, it does not indicate that Polynesians settled and populated the Americas. It indicates there was limited contact well after South America was settled by paleoindians via Beringia.

As for bottle gourds, like dogs, paleoindians brought the plant with them from Asia. It makes sense given that gourds make excellent containers if one doesn't have pottery. Again, not a sign of Polynesian origin of Native Americans

	<TEXT>  Why not think about early navigation from those places across the pacific ocean?

People have, but there is no archaeological evidence for an earlier occupation in Polynesia other than the Polynesian occupation. It would be impossible for these people to cross the Pacific and not stop at these islands on their way to the Americas. You also could not have a sufficiently large enough population come from Polynesia to settle all of the Americas. </TEXT>

At least not super well. There are surviving wooden lintels at places like Tikal and Chichen Itza. The lintels at Tikal were radiocarbon dated to check the accuracy of the Maya Long Count. Obviously they couldn't date it down to the year, but it did confirm that dates thought to be in the Classic period were, in fact, in the Classic period. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know the T-shape of the teeth makes Pakal look a little like a dufus, but the T-shape has great symbolic importance in Maya belief. The T-shape can be seen on depictions of the [Sun God](http://trentu.ca/anthropology/documents/Williams-DENTALMODIFICATIONINTHEPOSTCLASSIC.pdf). Houston and Taube have identified this shape as the [*ik* sign](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pamela_Geller2/publication/306278362_Altering_Identities_Body_Modification_and_the_pre-Columbian_Maya/links/57b604c708ae19a365fc5336.pdf). The *ik* sign denotes wind, breath, and aroma which are all things related to life. The use of the T-shape/*ik* sign on the mask is a way to ensure that Pakal continued to live through a jadeite effigy even if he, as a person, passed away. </TEXT>

I booked my flight/hotel before the program came out forgetting that Wednesdays are usually reserved for Society functions, some paid or reserved sessions, and registration. I'm a little upset because this is an extra day at the hotel + food that I could have avoided paying. So now I need to find things to do on Wednesday.

On the plus side, I am going to visit the Star Trek exhibit at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle while I wait for my train to Vancouver, BC tomorrow afternoon. So that will be cool </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They had advanced civilizations, though. It is just how you define advanced that either includes them or not. It's like saying complex societies. Every society no matter where you are or when is complex. There are no simple societies. Even if you create a detailed and well worded definition to differentiate complex and simple societies, the definition is an artificial construct meant to create a division. By focusing on just the presence or absence of horses and pack animals you are excluding everything else about a civilization from their art to their philosophy to their culture that would otherwise be considered advanced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  guns are terrifying compared to bows. They make very loud noises and they fire instantly instead of needing to be drawn.

Ross Hassig writes in his book *Aztec Warfare* (1988) on page 238,

*But the Aztecs were quick students, soon observing that the noise and smoke were of no consequence and that the shot went in a straight line. Thus, when the cannons fired, the warriors would dodge to the sides, as they also did against muskets. But firearms were not the decisive factor. In fact, in the final days of the Conquest the Spaniards' gunpowder was so low that they tried to build a catapult.*

 Guns go through shields and (sometimes) armor like butter, while bows, especially native american bows, can barely scratch plate armor.

Not an arrow but, on page 79 Hassig writes,

*Spanish sources attest to the effectiveness of these weapons, asserting that darts thrown with the atlatl could pierce any armor and still inflict a fatal wound. The barbed darts were particularly dangerous, since the point had to be cut out rather then simply being pulled out.*

And page 83 he describes the effectiveness of spears,

*In one engagement, a spear pierced Diaz del Castillo's metal armor and was stopped only by the thick underpadding of cotton.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And of course there are the other factors that screwed the Americas over like lack of pack animals such as ox or horses. Having to travel over foot really limited the contact between cultures. 

Not quite. There are extensive trading networks in the Americas with goods traveling very far distances. To have those goods travel it requires people to move. Things like turquoise from New Mexico found in Oaxaca in exchange for cacao. Or jadeite from the mountains of Guatemala found in Jalisco. Or copper from the Great Lakes found in Louisiana. Or obsidian from Yellowstone found in Michigan. Sure, you could argue that these goods passed from hand to hand and it was no single person making these great journeys. But you could say the same for the way goods moved about the Old World, as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My experience with US public school was that the Aztecs were underrepresented, but they were never characterized as evil. If that has been your experience that is unfortunate. However, swinging the complete opposite direction by denying that any sacrifice took place is just as misguided as characterizing the Aztec as evil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You ignored two other words, mate

 basically what is used to demonize Mexicans.

Who is demonizing the Aztecs? And more importantly, why? Those of us that study the past do not judge them for what they did by our own contemporary morals. The Aztecs practiced sacrifice as it was a fundamental part of their religion and belief system. To deny what the Aztecs did or to obfuscate their actions is much worse than trying to condemn the practice. You would be denying a fundamental part of who they were.

You haven't seen Hassig's book? He's the de facto authority on Aztec warfare. You kind of have to go out of your way to avoid his book while trying to study Mesoamerican warfare. I suggest tracking down a copy and reading it before trying to tell others about the subject. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There is no Nahuatl word for Human Sacrifice [fact]

* huentli - offering; sacrifice

* tlacamictia - 	to kill or sacrifice humans to deities

* tlamictiliztli - human sacrifice

http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso

 Meso ritual warfare was focused on capturing opponents alive 

No, it certainly did not. Aztec flower wars may have been focused on trying to capture people, but normal and typical warfare meant killing others. You see this with Teotihuacan, the Maya, the Zapotec, etc. 

 Meso style warfare resulted in lower kill counts than battlefield killing style

Whatever "Meso style warfare" is, it included battlefield warfare. You see groups fighting on open plains as often as you see the using tactics and terrain to get an advantage on the enemy (hilltop warfare, ambushes, fortresses, etc).

	<TEXT> [Last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5zxqmj/friday_freeforall_march_17_2017/df1xi8y/) I said the Bristol Museum was allowing me to use photos of the Los Guachimontones site taken by Adela Breton in the 1890s for my thesis. Well, I received the high resolution scans of the photos. After taking a closer look at the pictures, and using Photoshop to clear some of it up, I think the photos are of Circle 1 and not Circle 2. It is difficult to say for sure since so few photos exist of Los Guachimontones before restoration. I don't know why, but it seems as though Phil Weigand failed to take photos of the site before he began work or he never made the photos available through publication. Identifying the mounds is even more difficult given the fact that the altar of Circle 1 is heavily covered in foliage. In Breton's photos the mounds are cover in some short grass and small trees. I'm a little disappointed that it is Circle 1 rather than Circle 2, but I'm still happy that these photos exist. I'll have to wait to see what my advisor says about them when I send him a revision of my background chapter with the photos included.

In other news, I came across some really old photos of the ruins at Ixtepete in the Guadalajara area.

http://tonala.org.mx/turismo/galeria-de-fotos/antiguas/pages/Ixtepete01_jpg.htm

http://tonala.org.mx/turismo/galeria-de-fotos/antiguas/pages/Ixtepete02_jpg.htm

I collected photos of the reconstructed ruins in [this post](http://tlatollotl.tumblr.com/post/137442937181/zona-arqueol%C3%B3gica-ixtepete-jalisco-mexico) on Tumblr. What I was actually looking for was photos of the ruins that used to be near Tonala, a suburb of Guadalajara. In the early 1990s the city illegally bulldozed the site to create a municipal dump. I've been searching on and off for some historic photos of the Guadalajara area, especially aerial photos, to see if anyone managed to take photos before it was bulldozed. As it stands, the only information we have on the site comes from Phil Weigand and a [rough site map](http://i.imgur.com/ltqOUba.png) he produced. It's a damn shame Jalisco has neglected its pre-Columbian past for so long. So if any of you know of any good sources for historic photos of Guadalajara/Jalisco, please let me know.  </TEXT>

Maybe not in the exact same form as in Europe, but feudal and republic-like systems did exist. People did have to farm a noble's land or give them a tax in the form of tribute from their own land. And a republic sort of government may have existed for the [Tlaxcallans](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5zjqkw/it_wasnt_just_greece_archaeologists_find_early/), [some Olmec](http://www.archaeology.org/issues/249-1703/features/5300-olmec-tres-zapotes-government), and Teotihuacan.

	<TEXT> In my undergrad I took some classes on Cypriot archaeology. The professor advocated that Cyprus was the home of Alashiya, though I cannot recall if he believed Enkomi was the site of the city. Cyprus always fascinated me because it was at a crossroads in the eastern Mediterranean. There are few places where you can dig and find Greek, Hittite, Levantine, and Egyptian objects in relative abundance within one site. I am surprised that no one has tried to chemically source bronze objects from outside of Cyprus to Cyprus' copper sources. Or maybe someone has and I have not seen the publication yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Isotope studies on five remains of people from Pannonia (now Hungary) have shown that people living on the fringe of the Roman Empire were much more fluid in their lifestyle than previously believed. Instead of a sharp divide between Roman farmers and Hun herdsman, these remains show that people switched from farming to herding and back again or vice versa over the course of their lifetime. I wonder, then, if a large portion of the Huns were made up of Romans who decided to join Attila rather than side with their homeland. </TEXT>

Edit: I hope their vinyl release is something amazing. Like 11 picture discs with each song featured on their corresponding record. Maybe have big 19.7" or 16" records for The Sun and Jupiter and little 4.7" records for Mercury or Pluto. It would be great to mount the records in a big picture frame like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Planets2013.svg/1280px-Planets2013.svg.png) (plus the Moon and Pluto) for your wall.

It seems as though everyone was affected by the Chichimec migrations out of the Bajio. During this time people were experimenting with art, iconography, architecture, and political systems. The old ways were thrown out with cultural fusions put in their stead. It's a very exciting time </TEXT>

That is natural rock incorporated into the wall. You can clearly see sharp divisions between the blocks and the natural rock. You do not see any blocks that appear melted.

As for the Greek wall, which I am not familiar with, it appears that some of the blocks are missing from the wall and the earth/rubble fill from the interior has been exposed to the elements. This would cause the earthen fill to slowly erode. If not earthen fill, it may be concrete that was poorly poured over the area to prevent further erosion and destruction of the wall. </TEXT>

After that, large spaces and openings form which were packed with earth and rubble.

	<TEXT> **The Maya**

The Classic Maya were known to have several house forms. The type, size, and cost of a house reflect the familys status within Maya society. Palaces would obviously belong to the ruling elites or very high status elites. But what if you are not a king or a member of the kings family? Where do you live and what do you live in?

**Commoners**

The majority of Maya commoners lived in simple wattle and daub structures. The construction of a commoners house first begins with the construction of a low platform. This platform is made of stone, earth, and other debris in order to raise the superstructure above the ground. The surface of the platform is stamped down and will act as the floor of the perishable structure. Next, a stone foundation is constructed with one or two courses of stone. This foundation will allow for the construction of the wattle and daub. Next, the wattle is constructed for the walls of the house. Wattles consist of small branches and twigs that are interlaced together. Next, daub is applied to the wattle of the house. Daub consists of mud mixed with aggregate such as sand, grass, or wood chips. This aggregate helps to bind the mud and prevent it from cracking. Lastly, a roof made of thatch or grass is erected to protect the interior of the house. The roof is gabled so that the slope of the roof falls in two directions from the ridgepole. The roof extends past the wattle to form eaves on three sides of the house and a porch on the fourth.  The spaces beneath the eves and the porch allow for activities to be conducted outside of the home in the light. One of the most important activities is cooking with the kitchen located against one side of the house.

That is a basic Maya house. It would look very similar to [this modern reconstruction](http://i.imgur.com/lxGbjXE.jpg).  It is very simple and very basic. Elliot Abrams (1994) conducted an examination of residential architecture at the site of Copan in Honduras. Copan was a large Classic period Maya city with some impressive structures. In Abrams examination, he estimated the volume of the materials used to construct these residences. Using these volumes, Abrams applied rates of work taken from replicative experiments to determine how long it would take to build these structures. For a basic commoner house, the house averaged around 200 person-days. That means it would take 1 person 200 days, 200 people 1 day, or some other combination of people and days to construct the house. Abrams argues that most construction would have taken place during the dry season, but the full dry season could not be spent building a home as other activities needed to be done (warfare, planting next seasons crops, etc). He argues that half the dry season would be normal for construction. In Copans case, that would be 60 days. That means if someone wanted to build a house requiring 200 person-days in 60 days, they would need 4 people to help out. Trying to recruit just 4 people for construction would not be difficult if one relies on their kin relations.

**Higher class**

Obviously not everyone lived in such a simple house and there are other house forms at Copan that are somewhere in between a palace and wattle and daub structure. At Copan, Abrams examined houses which he dubbed improved architectural form to set them apart from the basic architectural form of a wattle and daub structure. The characteristics that set them apart from the basic form include a longer and taller platform substructure which eliminated the porch, greater use of stone in construction fill for the substructure platform, the use of dressed masonry blocks for retaining walls backed by masonry and mortar for the substructure platform, the superstructure foundation made of masonry blocks, internal room size variations within the house , a beam and mortar roof or a vaulted roof using a corbelled arch, the construction of benches along the interior walls of the house, external sculptural decorations, and the use of a thick layer of limestone plaster to protect the house and substructure platform from the elements.  These stone built houses could be found in clusters around courtyards at Copan.

For comparison, this is a stone house at the site of [Coba]( http://i.imgur.com/dNkTNys.jpg) further north in the Yucatan peninsula. Or this [sketch](http://i.imgur.com/7SZWTgB.png) of a stone house from Copan (Fash 1989). These houses use a significantly larger amount of labor than the basic wattle and daub structure. The average amount of person-days needed to construct these houses was almost 4,000 person-days. That means if you wanted to build a house in a single dry season you would need 67 people working on your house for 60 days straight. Obviously, these houses could be built in stages. Perhaps one year the substructure platform was built, in the second year, the walls were erected. And in the last year the roof was constructed and the whole thing was covered in plaster.  Even so, you would need 23 people a year to help build your house. In these cases, these houses were most likely used by higher status individuals rather than everyday commoners. These people were most likely minor nobles rather than any sort of middle class we may have today. 

**Maya cities**

So what did Maya cities look like? Well, its not easy to reconstruct. Archaeological work is painstakingly slow and expensive. Depending on the research interests of the archaeologist, they may use what limited grant money they have to target specific areas they hope will yield fruitful data to answer their research question. That means many houses go unexcavated and are allowed to be consumed by the jungle vegetation. This makes it difficult to imagine what the landscape may have looked like with all those houses. Fortunately, the cost of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has allowed archaeologists to make use of this system to map huge areas. What they have found, is that the landscape can be much more dense than we previously beleved. The Chases have shown that the area around [Caracol](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R_Shrestha/publication/222667926_Airborne_LiDAR_archaeology_and_the_ancient_Maya_landscape_at_Caracol_Belize/links/5449187d0cf2f6388080d4e9.pdf) is much more heavily terraced than previously believed with formerly unknown sacbe (raised roads, white in color) linking the ceremonial center with other secondary centers. Another project focusing on the Postclassic city of [Mayapan]( http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/6/9/9064) has shown that the urban sprawl of the city [extended well beyond the city walls]( http://www.mdpi.com/remotesensing/remotesensing-06-09064/article_deploy/html/images/remotesensing-06-09064f12-1024.png). Those bumps in the landscape are the buried remains of buildings that create bumps in the landscape. These buildings would have been clustered into neighborhoods and barrios around courtyards, plazas, and smaller temples dedicated to a variety of different gods.

**Commercial buildings**

For the Classic Maya, there is an ongoing debate as to whether markets existed in cities. They, for sure, existed in the Postclassic but the Postclassic had designated areas for markets to be held. Classic period cities do not always show that same sort of planning. If you are interested, I did answer a previous topic on Maya markets [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/498w0h/suppose_youre_in_a_mayan_city_in_ad50_will_you/d0r6ria/).

	<TEXT>  Cavalry, though, that was a game-changer in the Americas.

Not always. Remember, the Spanish did not conquer Mesoamerica by themselves. They had Native allies to do most of the fighting for them. According to Hassig (1988), cavalry only gave a slight advantage. On page 237 he writes,

*It is true that cannons, guns, crossbows, steel blades, horses, and war dogs were advances on the Aztecs' weaponry. But the advantage these gave a few hundred Spanish soldiers was not overwhelming. In any case, individual Aztec warriors were shown to be the equal of any Spanish soldier, and the Aztecs in general proved remarkably adaptable. Individual warriors are reported as having grabbed the horseman's lances and thereby neutralized them. One conquistador recorded a case in which a warrior successfully defended himself against three or four Spanish horsemen. When they could not bring him down, one of the Spaniards threw his lance at the Indian, who caught it and fought for another hour before being shot by two archers and then stabbed.*

And then Hassig continues on page 238 and 241,

*Another factor favoring the Spaniards was their use of cavalry and mounted lancers. Before the Conquest, as noted earlier, the Aztecs used an open formation in their battle stance, since the denser closed formation is basically a tactic used to repel massed mounted attacks and was thus unknown to them. But open formations were ineffectual against cavalry charges. Nevertheless, the Aztecs quickly adopted strategies aimed at minimizing the effectiveness of the horse, but a major shift in tactics would have required considerable time, since it would involved retraining professional warriors. Closed formations were not adopted, apparently because while they might have cured the problem of a massed cavalry attack, they would have created a better target for Spanish gunners. Consequently, organizational changes played only a minor role in the Aztecs' adaptation to the Spanish challenge; ineffective tactics were abandoned, but new ones were not adopted. Instead, the response was largely technological. Devices and practices were adopted that aimed directly at these novel threats.*

*The Aztecs initially met the Spaniards in set-piece battles in open areas amid fields of maize and maguey. While the Indians often held their own and more, open fields allowed the Spaniards to take the fullest possible advantage of their horses and guns. Hence the Indians increasingly adopted countertactics aimed at minimizing the advantages of horses. For instance, when the Aztecs fell back in battle, they did so to areas, such as towns and ravines, where the Spanish cavalry could not be used to advantage. Once repositioned, the Aztec warriors turned and reformed firm lines to continue the battle.*

*Most of the advantages were not with the offensive, however, and the Aztecs were quick to use defensive measures. Passive traps were frequently built. Pits containing sharpened stakes were constructed in the streets of cities and covered with wood and earth so that they would not be readily detected. Hidden pits were dug in the water-filled canals to trap the Spaniards, and sharpened stakes were driven into the shallow lake bottom to impale horses. The dike system in the basin of Mexico was selectively destroyed in an effort to drown the enemy in low-lying areas.*

*Most of the innovative tactics adopted were static, however; the Spaniards had to be drawn into an appropriate position or maneuver. Thus, feints were used against the Spaniards, as they had been in traditional Mesoamerican warfare, and they were adopted to the circumstances of the day. During the siege of Tenochtitlan, for example, the Aztecs lured the Spaniards into positions on the causeways where they were open to attack from canoes. The Aztecs subjected the attacking Spaniards to coordinated assaults by land and water, warriors were often firing from armored canoes (chimalacalli) that were impervious to gunfire.*

*Moreover, the circumstances of the Conquest led to night actions by the Aztecs, despite their previous rarity. Night was a time of harassment during which the Aztecs yelled, whistled, and subjected the Spaniards to showers of arrows, darts, and stones from both land and canoes. But these attacks proved to be neither very committed nor sustained, although they had a significant psychological impact.*

The Mixton War was an uprising by Native groups in the Jalisco region against the Spanish and their atrocities. These groups were initially successful in driving the Spanish out of the immediate area. This may be because the Spanish were unable or unwilling to learn the differences in the numerous cultures and languages which allowed Native agents to freely operate in the open and organize their rebellion against Spanish rule. Unfortunately, the Spanish were able to recruit a force of tens of thousands of Aztec and Tarascan allies which they used to storm the fortified hilltop fortresses of the rebels. Once the main fortresses were conquered the back of the rebellion was broken. Other groups held out for as long as they could, but either retreated into the mountains or were subdued. Some groups like the Cora were able to resist Spanish rule in Nayarit until 1721 when a combination of disease and drought forced the Cora to surrender. Other groups joined up with Chichimec groups to fight in the Chichimeca War of 1550 to 1590. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A similar political model of multiple elites ruling a city/region has been proposed for [Teotihuacan](https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/PEREGRIP/Publications/dual_processual.pdf) and for the [Teuchitlan culture](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285947727_Corporate_Power_strategies_in_the_late_fromative_to_early_classic_tequila_valleys_of_central_jalisco) (not as widely known). I honestly know very little about Tlaxcala, so it came as a surprise that they may have used this model and that it was recorded in early colonial documents. The author of the Science article wrote another piece for [Archaeology.org](http://www.archaeology.org/issues/249-1703/features/5300-olmec-tres-zapotes-government). In this piece, Christopher Pool has suggested that Tres Zapotes, an Olmec center, adopted the collective governing model which allowed them to continue into the Late Formative while La Venta and San Lorenzo were abandoned. This, too, was also new to me.

So there is some precedence to the model. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As an addendum to /u/A_Sporific's fantastic response, you may be interested in the section [The Maya](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/mesoamerica#wiki_the_maya) in our FAQ which contains several previous topics on the Maya Classic period collapse.

I want to also add that there is a disproportionate amount of scholarship on the Classic period. Both the public and academia are fascinated with the idea of lost jungle cities and mysterious collapses. Because of academic focus on the Classic period both the Preclassic and Postclassic periods have suffered from a lack of equivalent attention. This gives a skewed perception that the Classic period was somehow more populated, prosperous, and important than the preceding or succeeding periods. I've provided below several sources that you may want to consider reading if you would like to further explore the topic of the Postclassic Maya.

	<TEXT> The Bristol Museum has graciously allowed me to use from their collection three photos and two site maps of Los Guachimontones produced by Adela Breton in the 1890s for my thesis free of charge. While I cannot share with you all the high resolution copies, I can share links to their site that do show lower resolution versions of the photos and site maps.

The photos appear to be the central altar for Circle 2, which is the [prettiest](http://i.imgur.com/d69q8K8.jpg) of the guachimontones restored at the site. While Circle 1 is much larger than Circle 2, it also suffered more damage from modern farming. Only half of it's 12 platforms could be resorted. The altar was also badly damaged from looters. Some of the damage was filled in by restoration efforts, but the huge looters pit presented an opportunity to create a stable path to the top of the altar without damaging the rest of the structure. So if you search on Google for guachimontones and see something like [this](http://www.destination360.com/north-america/mexico/images/s/guachimontones.jpg), it was taken from the top of Circle 1's altar looking towards Circle 2.

http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/multimedia/entry.php?request=resource irn=173632 width=700 format=jpeg
 
This is one of the site maps,
 
http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229150
 
This is the other site map,
 
http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229149

What I find amusing about Breton's site maps are the number of platforms she draws. For Circles 1, 2, and 3 she drew 8 platforms. She did say in a letter to a colleague that the maps were quick sketches, so I won't fault her too much. But only Circle 3 has 8 platforms. Circle 2 has 10 platforms and Circle 1 has 12 platforms.

Including these photos and site maps won't impact my thesis too much. I want to include them so they get published somewhere, so that people can see their condition before restoration (few photos exist unfortunately), and so that Breton can get recognition for identifying these structures so early. I wish she had published them at the time so more people could have investigated the region earlier, but what are you going to do? I don't want to take away from Phil Weigand's work on these structures and this area. Without him we would be nowhere and there is no argument on that. And he really is the first person to identify the structures and publish on them despite criticism from colleagues at the time. But recognition for Breton is still deserved.

Anyway, just wanted to share and I hope you all enjoy looking at old photos of archaeology sites as much as I do.

Edit:

Yay! I received an email today on the timeline for an edited volume on architectural energetics I am making a contribution to. My chapter draft needs to be submitted by September 1st. If things go smoothly, the entire volume will be sent out for external and publisher review next March with publication presumably sometime after that. Whoo! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is another article by Wade on the collective government model previously discussed in [this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5zjqkw/it_wasnt_just_greece_archaeologists_find_early/). While the Olmec were mentioned in Wade's Science article, for Archaeology.org Wade explores the topic of collective governance among the Olmec further. She interviewed Christopher Pool, one of the current leading experts on the Olmec, who excavated Tres Zapotes and proposed the collective governance model for the site. I thought this was a really great article. It highlights the differences within the Olmec culture instead of lumping all three major centers into one broad category. I also did not know the Epi-Olmec occupied Tres Zapotes. I was under the impression that they occupied other centers in Veracruz that were constructed after the Olmec culture declined/disappeared/changed. </TEXT>

Maybe I could have even talked about the Teuchitlan culture since they, also, appear to be collectively governed by lineages. Instead we have people fighting over the poor word choice in the article title, debating whether the Iroquois influenced the US Constitution, or how Greece is an older example of democracy while ignoring the content of the article. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Maya Long Count did not lead to anything. It was simply a count up from the point of creation. New Agers and the misinformed confused the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun (a period of 144,000 days) with the Maya creation story in which one of the previous peoples created by the gods to worship them were killed around the 13th b'ak'tun. If anyone bothered to read the creation story, they would know that with humans the gods finally got their creations correct and there was no need to try again. And if anyone bothered to track down references to the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun, not only would they discover that only two inscriptions have ever been recovered that reference this period (and the context does not include any sort of destruction), but that the Maya extrapolated dates set even further in the future than the 13th b'ak'tun for anniversaries of events like a king's birth or death. </TEXT>

It certainly does not hold true for the Teuchitlan culture that I study. For Teotihuacan, one of the hypotheses I have heard to explain the grid was the rapid expansion of the city to accommodate displaced people when a volcano erupted. People at places like Cuicuilco and further into Puebla may have fled north to Teotihuacan. It might explain why Old Teotihuacan went from somewhat haphazard to the Teotihuacan we know today which is organized in a grid. But that's just one hypothesis </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The only form of Native American record keeping in familiar with are the quipu knots.

The Maya, Zapotec, and Epi-Olmec have hieroglyphic writing. The Aztecs, Teotihuacan, and Mixtecs had pictographic writing.

 I'm genuinely curious, but after having had worked with archaeologists, I have serious doubts as to the validity of their findings. I've found that archaeology is mostly about using your imagination.

It sounds like you may have had a bad experience with a not so great archaeologist. I'm sorry if that is the case.

But to answer your question

And how exactly do archaeologists just dig that up? Did they dig up ancient texts?

It's not so much about digging up something that says "We were ruled by a collection of elites instead of a single king". It is about the available evidence and the context of that evidence. The lack of opulent palaces, images of identifiable elites, the distribution of wealth, and the form of architecture and its location are all lines of evidence that point to a political system that does not involve a king. For Tlaxcala, it was the multiple plazas, the possible meeting building for their elites outside of the city, the lack of imagery for a king, and lack of identifiable elite goods in the archaeological record that help to support early colonial accounts of the Tlaxcala political system.

I recommend reading [Blanton et al's article](https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/PEREGRIP/Publications/dual_processual.pdf) on the topic and then rereading the Science article, as well as [this article](http://www.archaeology.org/issues/249-1703/features/5300-olmec-tres-zapotes-government) posted the other day by Wade, with that understanding in mind. </TEXT>

I say could because the nacelle of the engine for the Marauder extends past the trailing edge. In the still/movie, the nacelle appears not to do that. However, the plane that is on the runway at the airport appears to be a DC-3. The DC-3, and its military counterpart the C-47, was used during World War II as a troop transport, cargo plane, and for dropping paratroopers into Normandy not as a bomber. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Despite what the title says, the article does clarify that the societies discussed in Mesoamerica are not democratic in the same way modern democracies are. Instead, these societies are ruled collectively by elites rather than a single autocratic ruler we normally envision in past societies. This article ties into a recent article over at Archaeology.org called [Kings of Cooperation](http://www.archaeology.org/issues/249-1703/features/5300-olmec-tres-zapotes-government) which discusses Olmec collective rule at the site of Tres Zapotes. This was mentioned in brief by the Science article. Blanton's work is somewhat profound for Mesoamerican studies and has changed the way we view past societies. His work has certainly influenced my own region in Mesoamerica with my advisor, Christopher Beekman, proposing a model for [cooperating lineages in the Teuchitlan culture](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285947727_Corporate_Power_strategies_in_the_late_fromative_to_early_classic_tequila_valleys_of_central_jalisco) which I am exploring in my thesis through an examination of their ceremonial architecture. As the Science article points out, we are still trying to test this model for collective governance. I am glad to see Blanton's ideas being applied to other regions of Mesoamerica which do not quite line up with our stereotypical view of past societies. I hope this generates a lot of discussion, both within and outside of academia.

[Blanton et al's 1996 article](https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/PEREGRIP/Publications/dual_processual.pdf) for those that are interested. </TEXT>
