	<TEXT> Oh man, that's a tough question. For me its been difficult to find balance. I would feel super guilty about eating a piece of pizza and then just say fuck it and eat more than I should. Which makes zero sense, I know. I've been training myself to eat SMALL amounts of the shittier foods, and not just binge like crazy when I do buy them. So I'll eat a piece of pizza, but first I'll eat a bunch of spinach salad or broccoli (weird combo but whatever haha). It leaves me fuller so I don't even want as much pizza. And sometimes I still end up eating way more than I intended. But I've taught myself to go back to eating well the next day and not worry so much :)  </TEXT>
