	<TEXT> It's a crappy job. But I guess somebody has to do it. That's what we tell each other when we get our pay checks anyway. Ever know somebody that worked in a mall? It's shit work for shit pay. It's made even worse when you're the janitor.

Every single night, I have to mop from Point A to Point B. If I had to be honest, I guess it wasn't such a terrible gig. Yeah, you got the occasional kid throwing up over the escalator. Or that time the kid actually got stuck in one. A loose shoe lace or something. Dragged the poor little bastard towards the cut off, destroying his leg from the knee down in the process. We had to shut the thing down for a week while we scraped out the flesh and blood and bone that looked like splintered wood chips by the time the stairs were through with it.

It was a rough time to be sure. But nothing compares to the goddamn [Animal Riders](https://goo.gl/images/2mN5jY). Ever since they opened up, a new mess every goddamn night. If you're not aware, the Animal Riders are this new weird fad with no real explanation for its popularity. Like frozen yogurt.

They're these sort of stuffed animals. Most of them are bigger than life size with an exaggerated head with large, pearly white cartoon eyes and a wide grin. They move around on all fours with a saddle on their back for the kids and wheels for feet. It's nothing more than a lame ride, though for some reason, they're really fucking popular. Which is strange. They're no faster than a golf cart and can barely even turn without coming to a complete stop. At our mall we have a dog, a panda and a goddamn pig.

Every night I get a call from one of the security guards: "The pig is on its side." "The pig is wet, needs to be cleaned." "It looks like blood, come mop it up. Next to the pig."

That fucking pig. It's bad enough that there always seems to be a new problem it, but there's also something just... off about it. Just the way it looks. It's like every hooligan for twenty miles feels this need to fuck with the pig. Easy target I guess.

And the people they have running the operation don't help at all. They look almost like carnie folk. Lots of tattoos and piercings, not exactly the type you'd want your kids around. 

It's kinda funny actually. Five of them run the thing, though they swap their shifts. So I'll see at least two of them, one in the morning, one in the afternoon. You'd think the others must have the day off, but then come night time, I'd see all five leave together. It's not something you would normally notice, except these dirtbags stand out so much, it's impossible not to raise an eye when they pass you in the hall.

Well, the days were going fairly normal, just the usual daily clean-ups. The mall tends to slow down its business between Easter and the start of Summer. There are no big consumer holidays and the usual mallrats are still in class so there's not exactly a lot of excitement to pass the time.

That is until the other night, when things got extra weird. It was late, long past closing time. One of the security guards told me a good cleaning was needed. He sounded extra fuckin' beat. Said there was a mess by the pig (of course) and it had to be cleaned ASAP. He was practically yelling at me over the walkie.

Well, I get there and the dude is pretty much heaving onto the floor. Of course I told him to cut the shit or he could clean his own goddamn mess. He mumbled an apology and pointed towards the Animal Riders

"Over there," he blurted, covering his mouth as he dry heaved. I couldn't help but notice the bundle of wrinkled twenties in his grip. He shoved the wad in his pocket when he noticed me staring.

"What's the problem?" I asked. "Little too late to be riding the animals, don't you think?"

I was trying to lighten the mood, but I don't think it worked. The guy promptly threw up, mumbled something about quitting and just pointed towards the ride.

"Figures," I found myself saying out loud.

I came to the Animal Riders. The dog and the panda were on their sides of course. Next to them was a pile of vomit and next to that a small puddle of blood. Interestingly, the pig was nowhere to be found.

Not all of it anyway. The four hooves were still there, attached to the set of wheels that drive the thing. But the bulk of the pig was nowhere in sight.

That's when I noticed the foot prints next to the wheels. Pressed into the blood and vomit and headed towards the mall's exit.

"Jesus Christ," I found myself saying out loud. I turned back towards the security guard, but he was already gone.

I decided to follow the foot prints towards the exit. Peeking through the main entrance, I could make out a white van idling alone in the parking lot, just under the lone glow of a worn out street lamp. There was some kind of commotion by the sliding door. 

When I glanced a little closer, I could see there was a man shoving something into the van. It was weird enough as it was, but when I saw him round the side towards the driver's door, I saw that he was also completely fucking naked, covered in blood and vomit. I could see two distinct red trails leading from his nostrils to his belly button, mixing together with what looked like thick green pea soup.

In his hands was a screwdriver and the van's license plate.

The utter shock of the sight made my eyes go wide. And before I could stop myself, I made for the double doors and began speed walking towards the van.

"Hey," I shouted. "Hey you!"

He caught sight of me through the driver's window and started shouting something into the backseat. I heard him curse loudly as I got within a few feet of the van and he began to speed away, the side door still wide open.

As it sped right past me, missing me by inches, I saw two other men in the back of the van. A single cardboard box and a large fur coat flew out of the back as they shut the door, cursing and shouting even louder than before.

They took off out of the empty parking lot and into the night. As they made the turn onto the main road, they were going so fast I couldn't believe the van didn't tip over.

I looked down at my feet. I had stomped though quite a bit of the blood and vomit now and the sight almost made me toss up my dinner. That's when the box and the coat caught my attention.

I stooped down and slowly opened the ratty, tattered box. Inside was a treasure trove of drug paraphernalia and pills as well as a single small baggie of what looked like rock candy. I'm sure it wasn't.

Then the smell hit me. I looked up, towards the soiled fur coat stretched haphazardly across the black top. Through the glow of the street lamp, I noticed that the coat had a pink tint to it. A pink tint covered in crusty white and red and brown stains. Something large was just sticking out from underneath the cloth.

I hesitantly moved closer, shoving the coat with a quick, hard kick from my work boot. The thing flipped over and I nearly fell backwards. 

Staring back at me was the jolly faced head of a cartoon pig, still stitched to the saddle that had formerly been attached to four small hooves and a set of wheels.

It wasn't a fur coat. And it wasn't a stuffed toy. 

It was a costume.

I promptly threw up, my vomit sloshing against the pig's furry pink forehead and dripping into its wide open grin.

I rubbed my eyes, almost tripping over my own feet as I attempted to regain my composure. As I looked back towards the mall, I could just make out two figures in the entrance way staring back at me.

Though both towering figures stood in the shadows, the darkened silhouettes of a dog and a panda were unmistakable. </TEXT>

"What is this?" I found myself shouting, the shotgun quivering in my grip. I was terrified, scared shitless, though trying not to show it.

The kid was still next to me, looked like he was about to hug my arm. I didn't blame him.

"No reason to fear us," the man in front of us said, his arms outstretched as more and more people filled in the Main Street facade behind him.

The man. Or something like it. He was tall and his eyebrows seemed almost painted on to the stretched out flesh that made up his forehead. A just too small three piece suit gripped his body and I'm pretty sure he was wearing a toupee. His eyes were small and beady and, if I wasn't mistaken, had no whites. Just the hazel of his iris stretched from one side to the other. Just like the eyes of a goat. 

I was immediately reminded of the woman in the cabin. Just in time too.

The helicopter whooshed overhead, hastily and somewhat sloppily making its landing in the spot where the kid's car used to be.

Used to be... shit...

The woman and two large looking gentlemen disembarked. Her once creaseless suit was a heap draped over her scuffed and tired looking body. She marched towards us, all business, taking the lead over the two burly men.

The kid nudged me, motioning away from the woman and the chopper. Towards the man and his crowd. Their eyes were still plastered to us, all of their faces wearing the same facsimile of a human smile. It was as if they didn't even notice the helicopter or the doctor huffing her way towards us. The man in the suit in particular almost looked like he was about to wink. Almost.

"Just hold it," the doctor started. "Just hold it right there goddamnit!" She brushed past me, though I noticed a small moment of hesitation when she met eyes with the kid. She almost looked surprise, an emotion she didn't seem too fond of.

"Dr. Rabinovitch," the man in the suit began. At the sound of the guy's strange voice, the kid squeezed my arm uncomfortably. I didn't blame him. "So lovely to see you today. And such a lovely day it is, isn't it-"

"Not in the mood, Smith," the woman cut the man off, turning her full attention towards me. Her two large guards seemed ready to pounce and I found the kid and I must've been thinking the same thing. Together we stepped back as I raised my shotgun.

The woman smiled a crooked grin of too perfect teeth. I felt like firing right then and there.

"What is this?" I shouted again. "That Thing... that fucking Thing! What the hell is It?"

"Hell, Samuel, if you stuck around the cabin a little longer, you'd already know," the doctor said. "I was just getting to It when somebody threw a fucking walkie talkie at my face!"

"Oh," the man cooed. "Language, doctor, please..."

"Jesus, Smith..." the woman said as she lit a cigarette. Smith, the man, only smiled back. "I'm not in the business of repeating myself," she continued, "but since your friend here looks new, I'll indulge you. Well," she stopped herself, "new-ish."

She waved at the kid who took another step back.

"Just talk to me," I said suddenly feeling very protective of boy. "Don't worry about him."

"Very well. I'll skip the long version and just tell you the truth," she said as she breathed in a lung of smoke that escaped out of her nose effortlessly. "We don't really know. Hell, apparently the Thing has been around so goddamn long, we have records that go back to..." 

She paused, as if she caught herself saying too much. "Well... a very long time," she went on. "And I'm sure you can see why certain... officials... might find good use of such a... being."

"So this is a government thing?" I asked, taking note that the kid was looking more and more distressed.

"In a matter of speaking," she continued. "It's a government thing sure, but not the government you're... familiar with."

I took a moment to eyeball the woman and her cohorts... as well as the mass of people behind them which I could now see was nearly twice the size that it was just a few minutes before. They were beginning to circle around us, something I had failed to notice as the doctor was speaking.

"And these people," I began. "Are they some kind of cult?"

"Now that's a harsh word," Smith said, looking genuinely hurt. "We prefer 'Believers.'"

"Of course you do," I said as I circled around, the shotgun now pointed directly in the eyes of one of the 'Believers' standing directly behind us, a very old looking knife in her grasp.

"We're leaving now!" I shouted loud enough for everyone to hear. "As a duly appointed member of Pennsylvania law enforcement, I will arrest or fire upon any would be attackers or assailants! Is that understood?"

My lie was greeted with stone cold silence, the type of silence that made my balls shrivel into my lower cavity.

And then the 'Believer' with the knife began to shriek as her body struck the ground with incredible force. So did half the congregation, all in unison, heaving their bodies as they shouted in tongues.

"Oh Christ," I heard the doctor mutter as her and the goons began to back away down Main Street. "Let's go Smith."

Smith suddenly moved towards us. I pointed the shotgun and he just smiled, lowered to the ground and kissed the forehead of the writhing woman. He got back to his feet and mouthed something, smiling like a loon. He joined the doctor and her guards and together they made haste towards the other side of town. I was suddenly struck by an incredible feeling of unease, even more so than the entire situation warranted.

Something bad was about to happen.

The kid grabbed my arm yet again, shaking and pointing. "Look... look at those ones... look at the ones still standing," he stammered, his teeth clicking uncontrollably as he literally shook with fear.

But I did notice. With half the 'Believers' on the ground shaking and moaning, that left the other half just standing there, lost in a twilight state. All of them wore the same expression, one of eerie understanding, their grins baring no teeth. Just a half smirk that didn't budge beneath their blinkless eyes.

And then they began to move too, though not at all in the same fashion as the ones on the ground. Instead, they first began to vibrate. This was followed by a horrible cracking sound, the sound of bone gnashing against bone, as something began to give in each and every one of them.

All throughout this, the only soundtrack was the chorus of moans as their brethren continued to writhe upon the dirt and grass.

And then the ones still standing, they began to crumble. Their heads and chest began to cave in as if they were being sucked through a miniature black hole localized within their breast cavity. I could just make out skulls and teeth through the simultaneous waves of blood and mutilated flesh, grinding into forced nothing as they were seemingly sucked within themselves.

Just when the impossible sight could not get any stranger, they began to move. As one, these former beings struggled to shove themselves forward, one foot in front of the other. We watched in stunned horror as they began to find one another, their limbs wrapping impossibly around their blood-soaked and mutilated kin.

I wanted to look away but couldn't, the surreal, ghastly sight just too damn strange to turn away from. They were joining. First two became one. Then that one found a third and the process started again, each Thing finding another piece of Itself, slowly and sloppily and gruesomely evolving.

The kid promptly vomited on my shoes, snapping me out of my hypnotized funk.

Behind us, the chorus of moans was muffled as a trail of black vans began to pull into the city in the direction from which we came, speeding over the road and directly up to the front of the security gate.

"Run," I said, practically a whisper. And we did. As fast as our legs could carry us. We ran away from the black vans and the writhing crowd, down towards the woods behind Main Street, the only direction that somehow made sense.

I could just begin to hear men barking orders from the van as we hit the line of trees, the branches cracking against our heaving shoulders as we didn't dare slow our pace.

I chanced a quick look over my shoulder. I saw more towering goons wearing suits. They wandered effortlessly past the city limits, walking directly up to the crowd on Main Street. Most of the suits were holding something in their hand, looked like a large cell phone. I could just make out a slight buzz.

The last thing I saw was a group of the towns people now on the ground, no longer conjoined. Instead, they were shrieking, wailing loudly with what sounded like pain, their deformed, fleshy limbs wiggling in the air with reckless, aimless abandon.

And that's when I ran directly into a large oak tree and hit the ground and closed my eyes.

When I opened them, I gasped loudly, afraid I had been out for hours. It had been seconds. Staring at me, at the foot of the oak, was the kid. Bunched up with his arms in a knot, the boy stared at me with a mix of confusion, horror and sadness.

He was whispering something. It sounded like, "The name, the name, the name..."

I cautiously approached him, periodically turning back towards the town to make nobody was moving in our direction. As I got to the foot of the oak, the kid barely glanced in my direction.

"The name, the name, the goddamn name," he continued, lost in what seemed like a minor psychotic break.

"My name," I tried to sound friendly. "It's Samuel. Samuel Beck. What's... um, what's your's?"

The kid stopped speaking. Slowly he raised his head and his eyes found mine. The red circles that had appeared gave me pause as I found myself stepping backwards. He had been crying, though I don't think even he realized it.

"That's the problem," he said. "My name is Daniel. Daniel Rabinovitch."

It took me a moment of realization, but eventually my eyes went wide and I took yet another step back.

"Oh," I said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand that risk can be involved with eBay sales. Having said that, I am in no way the type that makes a business out of selling things on there. If this was a simple matter of buyer received the PC, it didn't work and now they want their money back say a week or two later, I wouldn't dispute it. However, holding on to a computer for 2+ months without turning it on then telling me things are not working out after trying to change the operating system upwards of 3 times is a different story. My main concern is I get the PC back and it has irreparable damage done to it. Then I am out the money and a computer (not to mention the seller's fee through eBay).

If your recommendation after all of that is roll over and take it because business is business, I respectfully disagree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the comment. I looked into small claims court and it does seem like more trouble than it's worth (though for me, it's not just the money, it's also the principle of the situation). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PayPal is telling me I owe a full refund to a buyer that had purchased a PC from me over two months ago because now it is "not working right," even though in a message she told me it had been turned on for the first time just last week. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> EDIT - Thank you all for the comments and recommendations. While it sounds like I may be out of luck, I will still try to contact PayPal directly and fight it out a bit more. Regardless, I am unfortunately done with their services for good and will be letting them know (after 15+ years). I know that may not mean a lot to a large entity like PayPal, but it certainly does to me.

The buyer had sent me multiple messages on eBay that have stated she tried to switch the operating system from Windows 8 to 10 and then back to 8. Again, this was just a week ago despite the fact that they have had it since the first week of February. As the title states, she also indicated that she had just turned it on even though she's had it for 10 weeks now (which I find so bizarre). I am getting nowhere with PayPal's customer service and I really don't think I should have to pay this. Am I wrong here or is does this all sound a little suspicious? Does anybody know of any resources I should use to fight this besides PayPal? eBay basically told me they cannot do anything and if the buyer did do something to hinder the PC, I'll not only be out $300, but also eBay's fee and I won't be able to resell it.
