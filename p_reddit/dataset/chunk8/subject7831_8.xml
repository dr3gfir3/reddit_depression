	<TEXT> That is exactly what I think.  It was truly uncharacteristic of him, and knowing what I know now, it was very clear that he could not face me, knowing what he had done to me.  

I know that feeling very well at this point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I am going to share with you today started many years ago.  It was a time in my life marred by tragedy, severe depression and several near attempts at suicide. It took an immense amount of emotional exploration and healing as well as time, but it did lead me to my passion for travel and exploration that became the most meaningful thing in my life.  The dark did eventually lead me to light. But that was only temporary.

It was six years ago that I lost my son.  My heart.  My wholeness.  I had been a single father for almost all of Hunter's life until then.  His mother went off the rails and left for Colorado with her dealer almost immediately after recovering from her pregnancy. It seemed that the year she had spent clean had simply been too much for her.  She snapped back from the unusually long period of sobriety and clearly was not able to cope with the responsibility of parenthood.

I was not perfect either.  But to be fair and allow myself to simply be proud, I will say that I really stepped up as a father.  With the challenges I was given, I did an exceptional job of putting myself aside and making Hunter the center of my life.  I did everything for him, and the love that we shared was the most rewarding thing I had ever experienced.  Until he was suddenly gone.

We had been on a three night camping trip in the Allegheny Forest.  Hunter was six years old, and though he was becoming slightly more resistant to the plans I would make, he absolutely loved camping.  We would sit by the camp fire at night, and he would begin these conversations that would quickly become philosophical.  It was so wonderful for us to discuss whether or not we both saw colors exactly the same way, and try to answer all of the child like questions that would lead to mystical and esoteric exploration.

It was mid afternoon when we broke to eat lunch.  We had just climbed hundreds of vertical feet to the top of an incredible waterfall.  We sat, eating  cheese and pepperoni on the boulders near the head of the falls.  We rested, lied back and warmed our bodies in the sun.  Fat and happy we soon both swooned in the beating sunlight and took a small siesta.  I remember maybe thirty minutes of that strange dreamy, restful but half conscious sleep that happens in direct sunlight.  Odd shapes and scraps of memory paraded through my semi-consciousness.

 When I turned on my side to check on Hunter, he was gone.  There was no one in the area.  I called for him and searched for hours alone, absolutely distraught.  I cannot even allow myself to describe the state I was in because frankly, I cannot bear to come anywhere near to experiencing that feeling again.  Please forgive me.  I cannot.

After what seemed like two hours a family came hiking through the area I was in.  I told them what had happened through tears and worry beyond comprehension.  Within hours the rescue teams came in, along with local police and the hunt began. Bless these men and women.  Bless them and bless the local people who took part in the search.  For five full days they searched, day and night, through storms and overcast skies.  I never had a single moment where I thought that more could have been done for my boy.  My heart. My life.

After five days there was no choice but to slow and then stop the search.  There was not a single sign of Hunter.  There was nothing, and in the end after another five days of my wandering the trails, scanning the waters, and haunting that forest like a ghoul, I went home.  The moment my front door shut behind me as I entered, my soul was destroyed.  Coming home without Hunter was very nearly the end for me.

I drank constantly for months. I took painkillers, frequently mixing the two in the extreme, nearing overdose many times.  It was during this period that my sister visited.  We had been estranged for years at this point.  I won't go into detail and I don't want to be unfair, so I will just say that our personalities just never meshed.  It was like mixing fire and gasoline every time we met.  We always loved each other but the incredible intensity of our respective personalities was simply too much to exist peacefully in one space.

She did love me.  She did care.  She invited herself without my knowledge, showing up at my home on a Tuesday with her new one year old, Jessie in tow.  She found me in my boxers, nearly unresponsive, unkempt, unshaven, and living in filth.  She stayed for a week, cleaning, propping me up, getting me involved in grief groups.  She even found out that my friend Tony from school had lost his daughter just a year before Hunter went missing, and put us in touch.  I tried so speak with him and share the common experience, but he seemed never to be able to open up.  I would try to share my grief and he would just cry and say nothing, clearly turning inwards with his pain.

My sister did help, but I had a very difficult time being around her daughter.  It was simply too much to live in that house with her child. Eventually when she felt that I was stabilizing, she returned home and consistently checked in with me on the phone or on Skype when she wanted to see my face, and see that I was not failing back into severe self-medication.  For the most part this did not happen.  For the next three years I was on a slow and painful journey, but it was a journey towards partial recovery.

At this point I had come to my life's passion.  Over those years I discovered that the thing that made me feel most whole was exploring new places.  I became a seeker.  I had sold my small house, collected unemployment and traveled full time.  I would stay in hostels at times, camp often, and once in while treated myself to a nice hotel room where I would shower for hours and sleep like a baby.  I traveled much of Europe, spent some time in Chile and Bogota, lived in Spain for several months, but eventually returned to the States to begin camping up and down the east coast.

The day that my life changed again was during a hike through the thick forests of Maine.  It was after noon and slightly overcast which gave the woods this rich mossy feel.  As usual I was hiking and contemplating the universe.  Thinking about reality and how the level of randomness in probability theory must ensure the possibility of the incredible.  My mind often wandered towards such elusive and mind bending topics.  However, before this day I had never actually experienced the possible impact of such expansive considerations.

I had left the marked trail perhaps twenty minutes previous and was exiting a very thick section of forest, into a small clearing.  I stopped dead in my tracks, my eyes widening and my mouth gaping like a buffoon.

There before me was a gentleman sitting in a leather chair in his living room, wearing a paisley silk robe.  When I say he was sitting in his living room, I mean it.  However there was no house.  In this small dark clearing there stood the entire physical contents of what appeared to be a very dated, but classy living room.  He sat with his legs crossed, one slipper dangling over his knee next to a standing lamp in front of a mahogany coffee table. There was a very old wooden radio in "the room" and a small fireplace with free-standing chimney burning and smoking before him.  The only other actual structure whatsoever was a single door, and door frame behind the man.  Everything else was just a collection of common household items.  Picture frames on a small side table.  A set of coasters, and glass of whiskey on the coffee table in front of this gentleman. 

"Well, hullo!"  The man put down the book he had been reading and rose to greet me with a wide, welcoming smile beneath his thin black mustache.  "If you would forgive my informal attire, I would love for you to join me for a moment."

I stared blankly trying to comprehend this situation as the man remained standing, laying a welcoming hand toward the chair beside his.  I cannot tell you what I was thinking.  I don't know if I was thinking.  The oddness of this experience seemed to lead to some strange state of hypnosis. The result was that this was an incredibly unique and valuable experience, and I had no choice but to be a part of it.  Doing otherwise would be to cast aside a miracle.

I calmly approached the man, skirting around his furniture and introduced myself, shaking his hand.  I remember that his hand was incredibly warm, almost hot.  The whole space he was set in felt exceptionally warm in comparison to the forest I had been exploring.

"My name is Jack. My mother used to call me Cracker Jack as a child.  I must have been quite the handful" he smirked warmly as we both sat.  "So what brings you to my home here today?"

I explained that I had spent the last year exploring and camping, dodging several inquiries about what had lead me to this lifestyle.  I was generally mesmerized by the situation, but could not bear to tell this strange man of my loss.

He pushing a small plug of tobacco from a pouch on his side into his pipe and lit it.  He inhaled deeply, raising his eyebrows slightly. His eyes narrowed, examining my face very closely.

"We just met sir. I understand your trepidation.  But I am only here for a very short time.  I am happy to share this time with you, this unique opportunity for connection.  But I do know why you travel.  I do know why you seek."

His eyes locked mine as if they were trapping a rabbit.  He peered intensely and I could feel him seeing me in fullness.  It was not entirely uncomfortable.  It felt like I used to feel as a young child when I prayed.  It felt like God could see every corner of me being in completeness, but there was benevolence there.  He saw me, and it was perfectly safe.

"Hunter." he whispered.

I put my face in my hands.  I had no compunction to ask him how or why he might know my son's name.  There was nothing there for me but the sorrow that this name still evoked.  I was seen.  I was laid bare to this man. 

"Yes, Hunter.  Such a wonderful child, and such a terrible loss for you. Let us end that loss, Michael.  Shall we?"

I raised my eyes to look at the man, wondering what he could have possibly meant.  I did at this point start to feel slightly anxious.

His answer was to put his pipe on the coffee table, slowly rise, turn, and open the door behind him.  

My God.

Standing there was Hunter.  He was just exactly as he was the day he was lost.  He was the same age and wearing the same clothes. His face lit up seeing mine, and he ran to me embracing my neck with his warm, wonderful smelling arms.

My knees gave out completely, dropping me to the ground to accept this unworldly embrace.  I cried and collapsed as my hands explored and felt his little body.  His face, his birthmarks, the way his hair smelled and his bright little eyes were just as they were.  He was here.  It was him. My boy.  My heart. My love.

After several minutes of just holding him I raised my questioning face to the man in the robe.

"I want nothing more than to send you home with your son as soon as possible." He stated.  "As I am sure that you understand. I have done something wonderful for you and it is only fair that you may offer to return the favor, yes?"

"Anything." I whispered through my tears.  And I meant it fully.  There was nothing I would not do, for this to be reality.

"I appreciate that.  And I can see that you are being completely honest with me." he sounded so very sincere. "You may take your son home now and enjoy the rest of both your lives, and I ask only one thing.  In one year I will visit you.  At this time I will make one single request.  You must do that one thing for me.  It will be a small simple errand. It is the only thing I ask in return for your wonderful boy."

"Yes." I said simply.

"Very well Michael.  Be on your way then, enjoy every minute and every facet of that wonderful young man."  He smiled at both of us and ushered us away from the living area, and back toward the path.

Just as I had walked out of the forest missing Hunter years previous, I now left this forest with my son by my side.  He remembered nothing of the years after our previous trip and seemed completely and utterly himself.  We talked, and joked, and hugged occasionally as we made our way to the trail, then to the lot, and then back to Pennsylvania where I located a job and bought a small condo.  I could not go back to our home town since there would be too many unanswerable questions, so we started a new life.  Hunter and I spent every waking moment fully engaged with each other until he started school.  This entire time I continued to speak with my sister but could never determine any possible way to share the knowledge of Hunter's return.  The story was too odd, too unbelievable for me to consider attempting to explain.  I simply lived in the bliss of having him back, and decided that knowledge of his existence would be mine alone.

Shortly after Hunter's seventh birthday I dropped him off at school and headed home.  I descending the steps into the building's laundry room with a basket slung over my shoulder.  I stepped through the laundry room door to find myself standing in a timeless, 1950's style living room with the man from the forest sitting in that same leather chair before the fireplace at the eastern wall.  Everything was exactly as it had been in the forest, except that there were walls surrounding the room rather than forest.

"Michael, wonderful to see you!" He rose and shook my hand.

I immediately fell into the chair by his side, feeling strangely worried and defeated.  I didn't think that he would take Hunter away from me, and I did not necessarily fear the request that I knew he would present.  It was just simply that I knew the score.  I was a passive party here, with a job to do.  And I would be informed as to what that job was and I would do it without question.

I was correct.

Jack very simply explained to me that I needed to convince my sister and her husband to take a camping trip.  It did not matter where, as long as the forest was thick and dark.  Furthermore, I must convince them to bring their daughter Jessie.

I did it.  I knew, and I did it.  In fact it was even worse than that. The moment I heard the request, everything fell into place.  I realized immediately that my old high school friend Tony had lost his child almost exactly a year before Hunter went missing.  I knew that Jessie was next in line for the same fate, and that this might continue forever, in a never ending chain of parental despair unless someone stopped the cycle.

I truly hope that someday, someone will.  Until then I live for my beautiful growing boy. My heart.  My love.  My soul.

	<TITLE> He Rides Upon the Storm </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-18 07:38:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It was August 23rd when the storm came. That chaos that pummeled the earth and altered my life forever arrived amidst a sense of such peace, that I will forver consider it to be inherently evil.

I was only twelve years old at the time, running amok amongst the trees outside the cabin we had rented a week previous.  I recall tearing through the woods, ducking from tree to tree, trying to escape the site of my little sister, Sasha.  We had made a game of this that lasted days.  Despite her size and the age difference, I could never seem to lose her no matter how fast or skillful I was.

Typically this would have been the type of game that my parents would have guided me to avoid, expressing that it was cruel to try to evade my sister.  Today however, and this week in general, they had been acting in a rather peculier manner. Looking back I can now understand my juvenile observations and know that there was a certain strange tenseness between them on this night.  I recall them frequently ducking around a corner and speaking intently to one another in hushed tones.  I recall specifically at one point my parents putting their hands upon eachother's matching tattoos, and my father bowing his head and weeping.  I just stood there, worried and unsure at the sight of my father being so emotional.  It was unlike him.  It was also unlike both of them to invite our uncle Jack to a holiday part, nevermind a two week vacation.  Yet there he was, sitting on the porch cleaning his collection of guns.

I got very excited that evening when the sun began to set behind the mountain rainge in the distance.  This was the night that we were slated to have the bon fire we had been piling wood for, for so very long.  The warmth of that fire was a wondeful backdrop to the evening with my parents who began to recount tales of our youonger selves, and continiually inform my sister and myself of how proud they were of us.  I felt somewhat uncomfortable as the love being doled out reached a certain level, but I was happy in my heart, as I was warm in the smoke filled summer air.

Then it began, with a thundering, shaking and an unmistakable crack of lightnening over the lake in the canyon below us.  My mother shot from her log like a bowstring at that noise, and my father raised to pull her back to her seat with a strange, watchful protection.  He began scanning the area around us as he comforted my mother.

"Dad, what's the matter? It's just a storm. We can go inside" worried about the tension in our little family.

"Just stay close." I heard as he continued to scan our permiter.

Stay close. I immediately turned to relay that information to my sister, only to find an empty bench at my side.  She was suddently gone and I panicked. I jumpted and turned only to just barely glimpse her behind a nearby tree.

"You don't lose me!" she whispered adventurously.

I immediately knew that she had not heard our father, or caught onto the clear concern that our parents had at the moment, and I ran to grab her. Before I reached her she had managed another few feet into the woods, and then another.

The light summer rain began to fall.  Then it began to pour.  I shouted at my sister to stop where she was, telling her it was serious.  That worked and she stopped dead, looking worried.

I told her that Mom and Dad were worried and that we needed to get back to the fire immediately.  Within seconds I was shouting through a torrential rain, howling wind and snapping cracks of lightening all around us.

I went to grab her hand, and was stopped by her wide staring eyes.

"We have to go!" I shouted.

Her eyes only got wider, and her mouth hung open.  I realized that she was not looking at me, but behind me.  I felt my chest cave in, like a black hole had formed in my solar plexus, as I turned and backed towards my sister.  It was as if I knew we had a guest and I wanted to stand by her side to greet them, or prepare for what they would bring.

This guest was a nothing more than a black figure agaist the lightening-filled sky.  He seemed present in moments of flashing and nothing but dead space in the suddenly pitch dark between.  I recall him standing almost nine feet, though I question whether my percetion of height was skewed at this age. The tall thin man stood maybe five feet from us and began to stoop and draw closer.

I held my sister around the shoulder and stood petrified, solid and unmoving.  I simply knew that there was no moving, that it was not a viable option.  It truly almost never entered by mind as a possibility.  The only choice I partook in was to hold my sister strongly as the man reached out to us.

It seemed like he had moved perhaps one foot closer to us.  He reached out his hand, and his arm seemed to extend further and further toward us.  I could feel the forest bending around us, and started feeling extremeley nauseous as it's hands reached us both.

When the icy, black, clawed fingertips reached the necks of my sister and myself simultaneously, the man was suddenly there, directly in front of us.  Then the lightening increased in frequency, as we both yelped from the pain of those ragged claws penetrating the skin at the bottom of our necks, and we fell to the ground, beginning to losing consciousness.

But I did not black out until after I heard the voice of that man, that creature, that monster.

"Ten Years" it escaped his whole body like wind being tunneled through reeds.

Then eveything was black.

When we woke, and my sister and I did actually awaken simultaneously, all was white.  We were in a hospital room.  We soon learned that there had been an intense storm, and it had torn our small cabin from the mountain-face and into the lake.  No bodies had been recovered but our parents were missing.  It took almost an entire year before our Great Aunt, who cared for us afterwards, began to admit that our parents and uncle Jack were almost certainly dead.

That storm came from nowhere it seemed, and wreaked havoc on our lives.  It took everything from Sasha and I.  It left one thing and one thing only.

It left a small black mark at the top of the crest of our collarbones, at the base of the front of our necks.  And this mark matched the tattoos that my parents had shared for our entire childhood, in exact detail.

I am twenty-two now.  Sasha and I left our families 30 days ago, to spend a month in the stone farmhouse we are now fortifying for the coming storm.  We both knew it was coming.  We both started having the dreams months ago.

The Dream was always the same. There was this shape in front of an enormous storm.  He was thick and muscular, but had wings spreading from his sides, and a sectional tail as thick as it's legs poising and positioning behind him.  His eyes glowed amber-yellow and he said only one thing.

"Come to Me. Pazuzu will have you." It would howl.

Tonight is August 22nd. Tonight we will sleep, we must.  Tomorrow, the storm comes. It comes for us both. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> One Bad Night on The Road </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-15 02:28:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Have you ever seen the episode of "It's always sunny in Philadelphia" where they ask a sailor how he lost his hand expecting a good sea-fearing story only to find out that it was diabetes?   That always made me laugh, even before losing my hand.  Now it's even more so with the added irony that I actually have an excellent story if anyone is ever comfortable enough to ask me.

I'm Laura Davis. I'm 26 years old this month, and I'm a survivor.  Some of you may have heard about me in news last year, but I refused to do any interviews and ensured that my name was kept from public record.  I'm not interested in being known, or even in recounting the awful event that gained me public acknowledgement.  I am however interested in sharing this story with the young, seemingly helpless population.  I want you to know that unless you choose it, you are not a victim.  Facing anything, and choosing not to be victimized will lead to two possibilities.  Death and survival.  Either is preferable to victim-hood, so when faced with insurmountable odds, you fucking fight tooth and nail.  Win or die trying, but never, ever lay down.

That night was so dark.  Beyond the fact that there was only the slightest shiver of a new moon in the sky.  Besides the fact that I was speeding through Kentucky in the middle of nowhere.  The incredibly thick claustrophobic clouds had wrapped the area in a cold, dark embrace through the day and into the night.

I was doing about seventy miles and hour, and pounding my palm against the steering wheel to an old Joy Division CD I had burnt for this trip.  They always reminded me of Erin.  I could picture the times I had had hanging at her apartment back in High School as I screamed along to the track.  I could almost taste the Jack Daniels that had always been her go-to drink, and I couldn't wait to see her.  It had been almost ten years and for a moment I imagined tasting the Jack on her lips again.  I bit mine, and punched the gas.

I managed another two hours like this, before sleep started to overtake me.  I had had it mind to try to do the trip in one straight shot, but it had been over nine hours so far and I had barely slept the night before. After the nodding started, I decided that I would definitely need to get some shut-eye before continuing to my destination.  I considered finding a cheap roadside motel somewhere, but I hated the idea of spending $60 just to get a few hours of sleep.  I could find much better things to do with that money, and ever since I lost my last job things were pretty tight.

I finally decided to pull into the next rest stop, kick my seat back and sleep for a while, then continue on. It was a while until I found one and there were several instances of highway hypnosis before then.  I pulled up feeling relieved that the danger was over.  Silly me.

I pulled up to the small convenience store just before closing.  I rummaged through the trunk of my car to locate my toothbrush and paste from my luggage, and cleaned up in the store's restroom after buying a pack of cigarettes.

I decided to move my car to the far edge of the rest stop, so that I wouldn't be kept awake by all the lights, and also to try to prevent me from being seen by workers, or police officers that might happen by.  Once there I eased my seat back, covered myself in a sweatshirt and fell asleep pretty quickly.

It was only and hour or two before I shot up, as if shocked back to waking life by some sound, though I don't remember actually hearing anything.  I did however see something that was immediately disturbing.  Directly in front of my vehicle were two Mac trucks, parked cab to cab, their trailers at a ninety degree angle blocking my view.  Panicked I turned around as I put my fingers on the keys in the ignition, only to find that there was a third truck behind me.  The three of them had my vehicle completely penned in. There was no space to exit this trap.

Swearing profusely I grabbed my cell phone from the console and started to open my phone app to dial 911.  This was no joke, and I knew that this was not right and that I was in real danger. 

Crack!

I was stunned, half deaf and reeling from shock before I had any understanding of what had just happened.  I bent my head down and put my hands to me ears.  I saw my cell phone, now a tangle of chips and shattered gorilla glass on the floor of the car in front of me.  Looking up I saw a dime sized hole and spidering cracks in my windshield.

"That!" The voice blasted from in front of my car.

I saw the man, holding a bullhorn and standing the the roof of the cab of his truck.  He was dirty, oily, bearded and slightly overweight.  Your traditional trucker type.

"That, is the last time anyone will use a firearm tonight." His tone sounded like someone announcing a monster truck rally.

I ducked lower in my seat, not trusting the promise of discontinued shooting, not trusting any of this.

"You have seven hours until sunrise, missy." he spat. "It's real simple.  We won't enter your vehicle. There will be no more shooting.  If you get out of this area, you win and we leave.  If the sun rises and you're still in here, we get back to shooting, it's over for you."

I sat and listened. There was no point in doing otherwise.

"Now you have a good night now, missy." He climbed down from the roof, threw the bullhorn into his cab and climbed in after it.  

I never saw the man's face.  It was dark, and he had held the bullhorn for the entire time he was speaking.  I knew that there must be others, so I started to examine my surroundings.  I could just barely make out that each man was in his cab.  They seemed to be wearing masks, but all three of them were just sitting calmly in their respective driver's seats.

"Fuck, fuck fuck!"

I started looking around me, looking for anything that might help.  Anything I could use as a weapon, but there was nothing.  Loose change, CD's pens, a coffee cup, nothing helpful at all.

Then I looked ahead, where the two cabs of the trucks in front of me met and started thinking.  I felt like if I could get some decent speed I might be able to ram my car through them, pushing them aside and squeeze out.  That seemed like my best bet.  They had even said that they would not enter my car, so if that was true, and even if I didn't make it I might still be safe while I figure out other options.

Without another though I turned the key.

Nothing.  Dead silence, not even that clicking noise.  Thy must have disabled my car while I was asleep.  There was nothing for it.  I just needed to get my body out of this space.

I continued to look around at the men in the trucks, making entirely sure that they were all still in place in their cabs.  One of them had even pulled a stetson hat over his mask as if he were taking a nap.  Fucker.

I weighed about 112 pounds at the time, had run track in school, and marathons after graduation.  I was in really decent shape.  These guys were older, overweight and sloppy.  I started thinking that my absolute best bet was an immediate push.  Just fling the door open, book it towards one of the trailers and slide underneath toward the woods or toward the lit up store.  In the end, I decided that I would run straight towards and under the trailer in which I could see the napping trucker. It seemed like my best bet.

I put my hand on the door handle and started breathing fast, pumping up my adrenaline. Withing seconds I was halfway there, running full tilt and getting prepared to throw my body under that truck.  I saw the door swing open to my right, but ignored it, just completely focused on the dead center of the trailer.  

Suddenly I felt like I had slammed my arm on something I had not seen, and spun in pain.  I raised my right hand as I turned to see that it was completely missing, blood pumping from the stump at my wrist.  I fell backward, hard onto my spine.  Over me I saw a man in denim overalls, donning a clown mask, holding a machete in his right hand, and my hand in his left.  He raised it up like a trophy and turned to the other two men who were now surrounding the area that I had been heading for.

I knew my time was limited, I picked myself up and bolted back to the car.  They didn't even bother chasing me, too wrapped up in hooting and shouting and playing with the piece of me that they had managed to steal.  I had kept my left hand clamped hard on my wrist, and even manged to shut the car door without letting go.  I knew I needed to make a tourniquet however, and only had one hand to do so.  Luckily I happen to be left handed.

I managed to get my shoes off, and even lift my shoe up into my lap using only my feet.  I used my arms, while still clamping my right wrist, to raise the shoe to my face and over what seemed like ten full minutes, I had the shoe lace off of the shoe completely. With only minimal fumbling I managed to get the shoelace around my wrist three times, knot, and tighten it solidly without losing too much more blood.  I knew I was successful when the pumping stopped, and I immediately passed out from the pain and shock.

I shot forth from the blackness of unconsciousness like a wolf charging from a dark wood.  I gasped and shot upright, and somehow had this immense focus and energy.  It was a damn good thing too because by the looks of it I had been our for hours and dawn was clearly on it's way. I wanted these bastards dead, and there was only one thing for it. To determine how I could take them out.

I was hit by a spark of inspiration. I turned and climbed into the back, and unlatching the seat I gained access to the trunk.  Using my good, remaining hand I started pulling everything from the trunk, and frantically opening my luggage, rummaging through bags, and spreading everything I had at my disposal into view.  My right wrist ached like it had been turned to hot stone, but I tried to ignore the pain and focus on a plan.

The plan began to form, and quickly.  Out of everything I had, I grabbed three things and began my preparation.  Once done I scanned my surroundings to see that each and every driver was at their respective cabs, this time outside and ready.  I grabbed my gear and took action.

I bolted from the car just as before, headed straight for one of the three trucks, near the center of the trailer, but this time a bit nearer the cab.  The man at that cab yelped a good 'ol southern battle cry and headed for me with his baseball bat.

He swung. I ducked.  Then I rose and sprayed him directly in the eyes with the brake cleaner that my ex had left in my trunk months ago.  I kept spraying until it was clear that the man was entirely rehabilitated and the clear liquid build-up was dripping from his face and hands, as he tried to shield his eyes from more pain.

I turned swiftly, knowing that the next attack would be from behind and barely missed another swing of the machete that had stolen my hand from me.  I darted past the swing behind his bulky frame, reaching into my jacket pocket.

I pulled and threw the liquid-filled condom at him, bursting over his upper body, and immediately reached back into my pocket.  He swung again before I was able to dodge and the blade caught my right shoulder.  That arm was dead anyway.  I had no need for it.

The blow did take me to the ground however, but I managed to get the lighter out just as he was bearing down upon me, now bare handed with the clear intention to strangle me.  I flicked the lighter, and in moments he was a dervish of flame, twisting, turning, screaming and running directly away from me as I lifted myself off of the ground.

The cleaner spray, and the condom filled with nail polish remover were my last and only weapons. I did however bend down and grab the machete from in front of me.  I turned and saw the final attacker about seven feet from me, staring.  

I smiled.  I casually walked straight toward him, eyes locked and my smile getting wider with each foot.

I've never seen 300 pounds in overalls run so quickly in my life.  He was the lucky one. As much as I wanted it, I did not have it in my to chase that redneck rabbit.  I walked cautiously to the convenience store and smashed the glass storefront, setting off the alarms and alerting the police.

To this day I don't know what happened to my hand.  It was not found at the scene and I can only imagine that rabbit has it.  Fucking rabbit took my hand.  

So that's my story.  Like I said before, I'm sharing it to put one message out there.  You are not to be fucked with.  The only person that can kill you, is you.  Let fear overtake you, and you've already lost.

There is one more lesson here that I've not shared.  It's a tricky one. I cannot say too much about it, But the lesson is this: It is never over.  

It's been one year since that night, and tonight, I'm heading out in the very same car.  I'm driving to Kentucky.  And I'm coming home with rabbit for dinner. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was out in the woods behind my house today and I came to a realization. I realized that I have a story to tell.  In fact I've held this particular story for some time, almost thirty years now.  However, I did not know that I had a tale to share until very recently.  I had always assumed that this memory must have been a nightmare that I had as a child, and remembered it as a real waking experience as often happens in childhood.  We do not fully learn to  distinguish between the internal and external experiences until a certain age.  

I was six. 

I was camping with my parents in the Finger Lakes if I remember correctly. We had arrived later than expected but with enough time to setup camp and get a nice warm dinner fire going well before sundown.  It was a special time.  My father had just arranged a rather large business deal and he and my mother never seemed so happy or in love.  Their cheer spread and I remember sitting by that fire with the internal warmth of one's most meaningful memories.

After dinner I was told that we had an hour before sundown and that I was allowed to roam freely as long as I could still see our tent.  This was my invisible curtain, and I was a master at pushing the boundaries.  The limitation was instantly transformed into a challenge in my mind.  I walked and walked, weaving through the woods around the camp, but always keeping the most slight, distant sliver of the tent in my vision. I was finally as far as I could go. I pushed my back against a thick pine and peeked around it ever so slightly, satisfied that I was as remote and hidden as possible from my parents without breaking their rule.  That's when I first heard that voice.

"Hey. Hey you." in a hushed throaty shout.

I turned toward the direction that the voice came to find nothing.  I spun a full three hundred and sixty degrees two times trying to pick up sight of the owner of that voice to no avail.  I peered up into the trees, not knowing what reason there would be for a man to sit up there, but still searching.

"Down here, boy." with slight urgency. 

I looked down at the ground in that direction and saw him, the man in the earth.  In front of me was a hole in the rich black soil, about the diameter of two adult fists.  In this hole was was the face of a man looking directly up at me.  His skin was charcoal, complete with minuscule cracks in his skin and a strange light behind them.  His eyes were a odd sickly grey color, as if someone had plucked them from his head and let them soak in black tea.  He was bald, and his white teeth stood out like my socks would under a black light.

"Hello!" It said up to me, with a great welcoming smile.

"Um. Hello" I believe was my response, nervous but polite.

"I'm happy you came.  I need your help.  Would you like to be able to help me?" brows raised.

"Sure." I was clearly noncommittal.

The entire scene was so unreal it caused some shift in my forming mind.  This was like nothing that had ever happened, but the proper responses in this scenario were obvious.  They say hello and you return the greeting.  Would I like to help? Sure I would like to help.

"I am burning under the sun.  Would you pile some sticks and give me some shade?"

Realizing that maybe his face being so dark was a product of this very issue I hurried to begin piling sticks and small branches, eventually blocking the low setting sun from the man's face.  His eyes followed me as I moved around the area to collect material, and his mouth hung open in an excited expression.  I was very careful to not get too close to his face, feeling a bit uneasy.  At no point did the face do anything that alarmed me, and once I was finished I felt a bit more settled.

"Ah, much better!" The face exclaimed.  A few inches to the right of the hole that held this man's head I saw the earth start to move.  Soon pebbles were tumbling from the top of a small but growing hill.  Then small earthworm colored protuberances began to pop out from the mound.  Soon a full sized, dirty hand was above the ground, and it was holding something small.

"This is to thank you for helping me."

I looked closer without getting too much closer to either his face or hand.  The hand was holding a shark's tooth.  Two weeks previous to this trip I had lost this item from a necklace that I had purchased with my own money at Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut.  I was sad and had a sinking feeling in my stomach every time I recounted the loss.  Here it was in front of me. My eyes lit up, and my mouth dropped as I lost all sense of fear and gently took the item from the hand.

"It's mine! Thank you!" I said ecstatically.  I noticed the particular shape of the tooth edge as exactly matching the one I had had.

"You're very welcome young man. You are very kind.  I wonder if you would be so kind as to do one more thing for me?"

"Sure!"

"Would you get me a cup of water from that creek to your left?"

I agreed, and quickly located a large leaf which I cupped and used to carry a bit of water to the man.  I was nearly back when I began to imagine having to feed the face in the ground.  The idea of putting my hands so close to his mouth started making me feel uncomfortable about the situation again.

"Aim it.  Close your eyes and I will open my mouth wide.  Pour it with your eyes closed and then step back, opening them."

I was relieved that I did not need to get too close.  I did as he asked, moving closer, but not too close. Closing my eyes in this situation made me very anxious but I did as asked, and then slowly poured the water.  When I opened my eyes I saw, for a split second, blackness in the hole.  Then the face snapped back into place instantly and the man smiled again with big wide eyes and thanked me.

There was an uncomfortable silence which I decided to break.

"Can I help you out of that hole?" I inquired, feeling generous and helpful.

"Oh!" the face became overwhelmed with joy. "Would you? I only need one thing."

"Ok" I prompted.

"Just go get your mother and being her here.  She can help me."

"Oh." I was slightly disappointing that it seemed like I could not help and needed a parent to do the job.

"Yes, it's very easy, just tell her that you found something amazing. Don't tell her what it is.  Perhaps you could tell her that it's the most beautiful crystal you've ever seen and you need her help to get it."

The suggestion seemed like a good way to get my mother to come here.  I realized that telling her the truth would simply not work, that she would probably not believe me.

"Go now! before it get's dark. If you're mother comes I will be able to get out. Help me, and I have another wonderful present for you!"

"Ok." I replied hesitantly. 

I turned and headed back to that sliver of orange between the trees.  As I walked, it became bigger, more real, more like the real world.  The face behind me started to feel less real, like it was a dream I was walking away from back into regular life.  Step by step, my mind pushed the experience aside, as "other", as something I should stop thinking about.  

By the time I reached the tent, I had decided that I should not lie to the smiling face of my mother.  I decided that nothing would happen if I simply stopped helping him now.  I decided to stop thinking about the man in the earth completely, although the memory of this incident has stayed with me throughout my life.

Later in life I never told anyone of this, never shared it.  I had in fact decided that it was some kind of false memory, a dream, the product of a fever, or a hallucination from banging my head in the woods.  Logic took over and my mind and fit this into the most realistic category possible and segregated it from "the real world".

That is, until tonight, almost thirty years later after I cut a small poison ivy bush from the woods behind me home.  Until my seven year old son Jacob ran up to me and asked:

"Dad! Can you come help me.  I found an awesome huge crystal in the back yard! Help me pull it out!"

I lead him back into the house immediately, and drew the truth from him amidst his tears and apologies for lying.  I have never let him stray from my side in the woods since that day, and never will. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lucid Gifts from The Dream Lands </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-30 06:25:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Everyone! I'm a long time Reddit lurker but rarely post.  I am posting here today because I need some advice and want to share the incredible experiences I've been having lately..  I have no way to convince you of the truth of what I'm going to tell you, and it is, on the surface, quite unbelievable.  Nonetheless, I need help and advice about what to do and I do hope that the excellent people in this subreddit can help me figure out my next move.

Funny enough, this all started when I stumbled on a post by a user called "Magus_Somnia" on the /r/luciddreaming sub-reddit.  Don't bother looking for either the user or the post, I have spent weeks trying to track down the original post or poster after the first time I read it about a month ago.  I only have what I recall as being the content of the post which is not by any means complete.

I had been reading, researching and practicing Lucid Dreaming methods for about a year before stumbling unto that particular post.  At first things were very slow going.  I would try a new method every few weeks and have limited or no success. I would focus on the method that gave me any results whatsoever no matter how small and try to get better at it.  For some reason this never worked.  If a method such as "WILD" would work and make me Lucid for a moment before immediately waking, it would always happen that way in the future.  No matter how much I practiced I would always awaken when reaching lucidity.

Needless to say this was very frustrating.  After months of trying to develop one method or another I decided that I simply need to try other methods until I found the one that worked  for me immediately and consistently.  The hunt was on!  It took quite a long time, lots of research and many strange nights filled with broken fitful sleep but I finally located a method that worked perfectly.

It was strange, because the method did not come from any material about Lucid Dreaming at all.  After spending six months reading so much literature on the subject by many authors, posters, etc. I ended up locating my perfect method because I was browsing around about a movie documentary.  I had just seen "Jodorowsky's Dune", which was excellent, and I realized how little I actually knew about Salvador Dali's life.  For those that don't know, Dali was to be the actor playing the Emperor in this rendition of Dune.

As I was reading about Dali I stumbled across a mention of an exercise that he used to perform to enter a hypnotic state.  He would sit in a comfortable chair holding a spoon over a metal bowl.  As he would begin to nod off he would drop the spoon which would then would clatter in the bowl and wake him up. This would keep him constantly between sleep and wakefulness which he would use to draw and paint his dream images.

It was approximately three months ago when I tried this method for the first time. It was immediately effective for me.  Usually around the third spoon drop I would "awaken" in the dream rather than in waking life and instantly become entirely and solidly lucid.

I was ecstatic about the incredibly reliable results and not a night passed without my practicing this method. This went on for months.

At night I would fly.  Everything was at my fingertips in my dreams and I could create almost anything I desired for myself. I would go on grand adventures, live beneath the oceans, leave for the stars, and every day I would awaken refreshed and excitedly planning the next night's journey. 

I did not have complete control regardless of my seemingly endless abilities.  I was always able to call things into existence and control my body, but foreign elements would always present themselves regardless of my design. Mostly these were people and animals, along with the environments that I would discover when traveling.

 I never truly became bored, but I did begin to wonder what else I could accomplish in this realm.  I was pleased with my accomplishments and knew that with patience and diligence I would be able to find some way to take it even further. 

It was then, reading through the Lucid Dreaming sub-reddit that I came across that fateful post.  Magus_Somnia posted a short article claiming that he had devised a method by which dreamers could pull an item from their dream into the real physical world. His method was to call a pen, marker or paintbrush into the dream and draw five symbols, one on each fingertip  of your right hand. You would then grab the object in the dream tightly and wake yourself as sharply as possible.

I immediately blew off the idiocy of the claim.  I may treasure Lucid Dreaming but I am not any sort of crystal worshiping alien abductee type. Dreams were internal and psychological.  The premise was simply absurd and I put it aside at once. 

Clearly though, some part of me must have held onto the idea. 

That night as I was exploring the rich world that I had found after tunneling deep below a strange tree in my neighbor's back yard, it happened.  Before I knew what I was doing, I had raised my hand to the sky (in this case, the luminescent ceiling of a deep but brightly lit cave) and called down a Japanese paintbrush from the sky.  Though I was lucid I felt that my actions were being carried out without my full intentional will.  They occurred swiftly and without thought.  I drew the symbols I had seen in the post upon my fingers, watching as they glowed and shifted, as did my hands. Once complete I could sense this heat and heaviness from my right hand as if I were carrying a heavy molten hammer.

The sensation was beginning to become overwhelming so I quickly scanned my environment.  My eyes found themselves upon a white stone, smooth and slightly translucent similar to quartz.  I shot my hand from my side grabbing the stone and twisted my body quickly. I screamed as loud as I could while turning my body into a tornado of chaos.  A great intense light filled my eyes overtaking the landscape and blinding me.

Thump!

"Fuck" I murmured, pushing myself up from the floor.

It seemed that I had thrown myself out of the chair upon which I had fallen asleep.  My vision was blurry and my head muddled. I started to stand and was beginning to realize that something was wrong. My eyes were not adjusting, everything still seemed very blurry and reddish.  

When I looked down, I leaned two things.

First as I saw the blood spilling onto the floor in front of me I learned that I was injured and bleeding quite profusely.  It seemed that I had cut my forehead in the tumble.

Secondly I learned what I had hit my head upon.  Through the glaze and swoon I saw to my right, resting upon the floor, a white quartz-like stone with a red stain on the side. 

Unfathomable as it is, the method had worked.  I had grabbed hold of an object in my dream and brought it back to me in the waking world.  The implications of this were staggering and the experience was all mine.

I spent that night in the emergency room.  It turns out that I needed twelve stitches in my forehead along with a barrage of testing.  After a questioning, neurological testing, a CT scan and hours ensuring that I was no longer nauseous after the stitches were in, they sent me on my way with a clean bill of health.  I did not even really consider the injury or experience the frustration or pain regarding the injury.  I was too busy considering what had happened at home and what I would make of it with time.

I was sitting outside in a wheelchair waiting for my sister to pick me up when the worry struck me.  I realized suddenly that I had just had a moderate to severe head wound, after a semi-hypnotic practice.  Logic told me that the most likely scenario was that I had simply hallucinated the stone based upon my experience and expectation.  I became quiet in the car, depressed and worried that I would return home to find this to be the case.

I hurriedly left my sister's care and transport to find myself moving full speed to my den. I dropped to my knees smiling as I lifted the heavy, solid, real stone to my face.  In my relief I noticed something strange.  I have always had a very intense sense of smell.  As a child I would frequently tell my mother that there was a fire, only to find out later that my father had passed one on the way home from work miles away.  It was frequently a very annoying ability to have and lead me to being an extremely fastidious person, since the odor of day old food stuffs would intrude on me throughout the house.  

The point is, this stone had no smell.  And I understand that you will likely say that stones don't smell like anything. This is simply not true.  While stones do not have an overpowering or distinctive odor, there is always a strong trace of their original environment.  Whether it be a moist thick earthy forest, or dry desert sands, stones carry an odor.  This one did not.  This item had no smell whatsoever and frankly it disturbed me deeply.  

My trepidation took control of my excitement and I decided to simply go to sleep.  Normal sleep.  I spent the next day pondering the situation and my options.  You would think that spending an entire day deciding on what to do would result in something more,  but the result was strikingly simple, and honestly pretty silly.

That night, the spoon dropped and the sound rung in my ears as I opened my "eyes" to see the city around me.  I did my best to expect to experience this as if it were New York where I had been as a child, full, and teaming with people and businesses.  I was not able to conjure the amount of people to match even a small city, but the buildings, stores and houses were reasonable facsimiles.

I walked until I found what I was looking for, the bank.  It was large, cold, marble, and empty.  I strode right back behind the counter and headed toward the vault.  On my way I did see one man in the back offices of the bank.  He looked like a classical banker with his pin striped suite and greasy black hair.  He simply stood erect behind the window of his office, openly and penetratingly starting at me as I moved.  I watched his eyes follow me as I made my way. Once inside the vault I began pulling safety deposit boxes and after what seemed like a minute I had a stack of hundred dollar bills about as tall has I could hold with my one hand.

Just like the first time, I called a brush into existence, painted the symbols upon my ever changing finger tips, grabbed the stack of cash, and jolted myself awake screaming and twisting.  I knew that this time I would not be severely injured, had I again landed head first onto my treasure.  It seemed that I had gotten better at waking and remained in my chair with a small jolt.

I looked down and found my hand absolutely full of bills and leapt off of my seat in excitement. I jumped and shook them over my head, the sense of triumph overtaking me.  I would never have to work again, I would be rich and setup for life. No one could possibly take this away from me ever.

Then I took a closer look. The bills were green and patterned and at first glance appeared like a stack of 100's.  The "100" in the corners was clear and distinct and the entire design looked generally acceptable.  But the face of Benjamin Franklin was strange and incorrect.  The text of his name, as well as all other text on the bills were blurry and unreadable.  This was more like an impressionist painting of money, perfectly reasonable from a yard away but an obvious mess in the close light.

"Shit."  It was clear that while the trick had worked, my mind had simply not created a fully detailed and realistic impression of the bills in the dream.  And here I was with the result.  A stack of bills that looked as if I had drawn them from memory.  In the end I burnt them in my fire pit out back.  They were useless and additionally likely to get me arrested as the worlds worst counterfeiter ever, if found.

My next plan came to fruition quickly.  Clearly identifying the issue regarding cash lead me to this idea which I had actually already vetted and proved possible. If I could produce a passable stone, then I could certainly produce gold.  I needed to do this with something simple, not overly complex and gold seemed the perfect solution.  At first I was envisioning gold bars, still thinking about the bank.  Over time though when I began picturing myself walking into the nearest "Cash for Gold" storefront with a $500,000 bar, I changed my plan.

I needed to start small, but I also needed simplicity of shape and composition.  Something that would be quite clear in my mind when I was dreaming.  I decided on a gold wedding ring.  It was simple, easily envisioned and pervasive as a symbol.  Aside from that it would be very easy to sell.

The plan went without a hitch, just like the night previous.  I decided that using the city and bank were still viable and that it would be best to repeat that scenario, simply expecting the safety deposit box to contain a wedding ring.  The only difference in the entire experience this evening is that when I got behind the counter of the bank there were 5 offices, each with the shades open, and in each office were two bankers staring directly at me with wide strange smiles on their faces.  

I stopped for a moment and looked back, examining them.  Their smiles seemed to grow slightly as if they were pleased that I was paying attention to them.  They leaned in and stared even more thoroughly as I made my way into the vault.

Strange as that was, dreams are always this way even when you have some semblance of control. I proceeded quickly, found a wedding ring as expected, returned and was very pleased.  

I had done it.  I was holding a perfect, round gold ring in my hand, in my den, in the harsh light of reality.  The next morning I was able to sell it without a hitch and walked home with $350.  I was convinced that this was the method I would stick with, especially when I learned from the clerk that the gold was 24 karat.  

I simply couldn't sleep that night and instead did some research.  It turned out that there was a gold bar much smaller than the ones you see in the movies, called a kilobar.  The kilobar is used in investment and seemingly more common than it's larger counterpart.  In fact it was very common for survival types to buy and store these to use as currency if the monetary system broke down.  I had another plan, and even a believable story for the pawn shop.  I would tell them that my crazy uncle had been a "prepper" and had a cache of these kilobars buried under his shed when he passed away and left the property and belongings to me.

I still found myself unable to sleep that day and decided to wait until the next evening before proceeding. I spent my time studying the images of these kilobars and practicing imaging them in my mind.  Luckily, even though most are stamped, there are blank kilobars out there. When the next night came everything began perfectly smoothly for the third time in a row.  

Except for one thing.

When I entered the bank, there was no counter.  There were no offices.  It was a huge empty marble shell with none of the previous accouterments.  This was odd but I was also a bit relieved that I did not have to deal with the bankers staring at me from the back offices as I walked toward the open vault.  They were really unnerving, though they had made no move toward me or showed any signs of malice.

I entered the vault, pulled drawers and eventually had a six inch high stack of kilobars on the table. I called my brush, painted my fingers and turned to pick up the bars only to find the bars, and the table completely missing from the now empty vault.  Shocked, I looked out of the vault door to the main area of the bank to see an incredibly frightening scene.

There must have been thirty of those bankers in the main area, each staring, smiling impossibly widely and completely transfixed on me.  The ones in the center of the group began to drift slowly and smoothly to either side.  

Then I saw the Beast.

Behind these men was a two foot high mass of snarling, bucking, black dripping muscle and chaos.  The thing shook the room with it's very presence and it's red eyes fixed upon me quickly.  I could hear the words in my head in a guttural soul-shaking tenor.

"Prey.  Door."

It tore at me full speed emitting a sound like a pack of wolves fighting tooth and nail. It was faster than I would have imagined possible, on me in a split-second.  I could only react.  

It's face, if you can call it that, was in mine instantly as I was pinned to the ground.  I instinctively grabbed it's head to keep it from biting me, though I only saw it's razor sharp pitch black teeth after the fact.  It writhed, and twisted and seemed to change shape in my arms as I let out an intense scream and turned to attempt to throw it from my person.

I awoke.

I awoke at the hospital in incredible pain and confusion, partially due to the morphine.  I had been found by my sister who had come to pick me up and bring me to work.  I had been on the floor, on top of the shattered remains of my chair bleeding and unconscious.  I had three broken ribs, several fractures and contusions galore.  The police had said that it seemed like a wild animal, likely a buck, had managed to gain entry into my home, attack me in my sleep and exit by crashing through my back patio doors which were now completely destroyed.

I know better.

I did it.

I brought something out of a dream into our waking world.

I brought a nightmare.

God help us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Grandfather has a story to tell.  He is very old and does not know how to use a computer so I am helping to share his story.  I will type everything he says and I hope that his story will pass dawn forever. The fire is lit and he begins.

++++++

I am an old man.

Once I was a young boy.

When I was a young boy I was very ill.  The sickness took my body. It took my mind.  But it was a blessing.  The spirit gave me eyes. Eyes to see. It was a gift.  

All gifts carry weight.  The gift gave me sight but I could not always see what was good.

I saw my father.  My father cared for rabbits and my father was rabbit.  He would duck and bolt and turn. My father had the rabbit spirit with him.  I could see it when trouble came.  When the law men came.  Danger would come and the rabbit would twist and turn.  The rabbit would escape swiftly. Then danger would go.

Many times this happened.  The guns came. The law men came many times.  Fires came.  Machines came and roads came. All times my father he escaped the danger.

As a child I was happy with the rabbits.  I played with the rabbits my father kept.  I watched my father happy and content.

But rabbits are not strong creatures, not proud creatures.

One day the Snake man came.

The snake man is sneaky.  He does not come with big danger.  Snake man is not big, does not capture your eyes.  The snake man came to our family like nothing, like a light wind.

But I saw it.  My blessing helped me see him.  

Snake man was a white man.  He wore desert colors and his face was between clean and bearded.  Snake man was thin and his body twisted. His eyes like the dead.  There was no life there, no fire. Worst I could see his animals.  My gift let me see those circling snakes beneath his clothing.  The Snake man was had by the snakes.  He was surrounded by them small and thin.

That day Snake Man came to our house.  He took our paper money and he gave a bottle to my father.  I yelled but my father scolded me.  I ran but he caught me and beat me. I yelled because I saw it.  I saw the snake come out of the sleeve of the Snake man and bite my father.  I saw the little snake sneak his way into my father's shirt.

It was a small snake.

It made my father angry. It made our house angry.  But every time my father drank from that bottle the little snake grew.  It moved more and more. I would see it crawling over his shoulder on his chest. I would see it wrap his neck. It grew and grew.

It killed our rabbits.  I found them dead and sickly looking.  I knew at once that the snake took them. Poisoned them.

I told my father. I told my mother.

"The snake man, he gave you the snakes." I said. "They killed the rabbits, they will kill you."

They did not listen.  The Snake Man came back again and again.  He brought bottles and he brought snakes.  I watched them grow as my father got more and more.

I would watch them play over his body when he shouted.  I could see them curl to strike when my father hit me.  The snakes owned the house now and I would hear them roam at night.  They would come for me.  But every time they did I would stomp my foot.  Stomp Stomp! It scared the snakes and kept them away.

The snakes bit my mother one night. I heard the scream and cries.  I knew they had gotten her.  She ran away crying that night and did not come home.  Our home was theirs, not hers.  She had no home.

I was a boy but I was strong.  I took a rock and prayed on it.  I walked to the crossing and waiting.  I knew the Snake man came this day and I would be a warrior.  He did come.  When he came I rose up and threw the rock.  I was quick and strong and I hit the Snake man hard.  He fell.

I was wrong to do this. He fell and the snakes fled.  I watched them as they fled to my house.  I chased them and yelled.  I tried throwing more rocks.  But the snakes were too fast and tricky.

I got home and the snake were on my father. I was too late. He was covered.  He shouted.  He was angry.  He shook me and asked me what I did.  He slapped me but I ran.  I ran like the rabbit.  I was in houses and out of houses. I was in the hills.

I sat there all night.  I tried to find the way.  I tried to be strong.  But I cried.  I was very young and I cried. I had no father. I had no home.  

Worst of all, when my father shook me he gave me one.  It was on me. I could feel it.  It was a baby but growing.  When I grew up it grew.  It took many things from me in my life. But I was careful.  I had only one and I kept it close.  I did not want to give my snake spirit to others. I keep it close so that I could dance with it when we both die.  

That time is close now. I am prepared to die.  But today I woke and my snake was gone.  It has become big and strong. It likes my family and it is gone. </TEXT>

[[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/51dqwv/i_called_something_up_please_help_part_3/)]

So it's been a while, and things have really gotten away from me.  I want to apologize first.  I came here for help because I just didn't know what to do.  At this point things have changed.  I'm writing this final update for a very different reason than I started this, but I feel like I owe it to share the rest of what happened, and to be fair I have another motive now.

From the time of my last post things became intense but continued down the path I had begun.  I spent the rest of the time before the play enjoying what I had.  I spent the days and nights smoking, eating, drinking and fucking.  I lived like I had never lived before, in complete comfort and luxury. All of this was shared with Ella who moved into the apartment and shared time with me constantly. This became the status quo.

Ella had begun watching me and giving me pointers regarding my performance which was now occurring several times per day.  We were getting closer to the performance quickly and she was spending all of her time with me to improve my work.  After the incident when we were woken she started teasing me about a Spirit showing up after every performance.  Having had a tough time explaining some of the random events that kept happening after my work she would always be snarky.

"Oh, obviously the demon you just called started that lightening storm" or "Clearly your little pet turned out all the lights."

It was like that too. Every single time that week crazy shit would happen, over and over.  It became expected and honestly added a lot of fire to my performance.  There's nothing like a freak thunderstorm suddenly sweeping the city as a sound track to an occult based play.

Before I could even post one more update to this forum, the day had come.  In a blur of weed, sex, practice and luxury the time had come.  I remember waking up that morning after some truly crazy dreams and seeing Ella with an immense setup of breakfast food in the kitchen.  Believe it or not she wouldn't let me eat any.  In true strange, artsy Ella fashion she told me that the meal was a gesture, a good luck momento but that I should not detract from my focus by eating today.  We spent almost a half an hour sitting in front of the meal on the table, smelling the food, laughing and enjoying the way the spread looked.

As a thank you for understanding and another treat Ella spent another half an hour scrubbing me in the bath.  Seated behind me I remember her singing this tune in a very low voice.  It was not in English and when I asked what the tune was she said it was Sumerian. 

When I asked where she had picked it up I only got the reply "I learned it in Hell, from Zuul" in her very best guttural ghost-busters impersonation.

Regardless the hours flew just as the days had and when I voiced concern at D. not showing up, Ella told me that we should simply meet him there.

"There." was the oldest strangest cemetery I had ever seen.  It had long been abandoned but all of the original stone paths, gateways and walls were still present though worn and damaged in places. The forest surrounding the clearing was really amazing.  The statues that used to litter the cemetery had been enveloped by growing tress, and you would frequently see half of an angel statue, armed raised coming out from the side of the large oaks.

"That's you." Ella pointed to a large circle on the grass in the middle of the clearing. 

At first I thought that they had painted the circle and all the symbols on the grass, but as I got closer I found that it was different sands or powders that had been intricately laid out, almost like one of those Tibetan sand paintings.

I looked up at Bella, with the full moon behind her as she kissed me, approaching my face slowly with her eyes locked on mine.

I felt it immediately and my body tensed up.  There was something in her mouth that she was passing to me and it was very familiar.  Before I could place the feel of it she bit me hard on the lip drawing blood.  I started to react, but she just continued to kiss me harder until I relaxed.

When she was done I put my fingers in my mouth and pulled out a strip of five hits of paper acid.  I turned my eyes from the little star decorated stamps and looked at her questioningly.

"I love you. You're going to do great.  Take this." handing me a black strip of cloth. "Put it on and sit in the circle until you hear a bell ring.  Be careful not to disturb the circle they made you, and stay dead silent until that Bell. Once the bell rings you can take off the blindfold and begin the performance."

She turned and left me standing in an empty cemetery holding nothing but my own blindfold, scared about the immanent trip and confused about why she would dose me with so much LSD right before something like this.  As ridiculous as it was, I trusted her and did as I was asked, knowing that there must be a reason, and that it was in my best interest, somehow.

I sat down, tied the blindfold around my head tightly and completely, and sat.  For the first five minutes I was full of anxiety and could not stop thinking and stressing, hearing every creak of every branch around me. That began to pass and I started just focusing on my breath and preparing myself to perform.  Then the focus went away.  I was left just silent and dark.  The noises around me simply were.  They would come and pass, come and pass, like my thoughts.  At some point I felt like i was falling asleep, and began dreaming.  I would get these two second long scenes in my mind like walking through some alien landscape. I knew thought that i could not be falling asleep because by this point I started to feel that classic gripping intensity that happens when you take acid, and it's coming on strong.

 I must have sat like this, taking tours through my mind and vision as the trip began to intensify for what seemed like two hours. I was reeling, awash and afloat in myself. There was nothing outside me, I had no concept for the exterior world whatsoever, no idea where I was or what I was doing. Just endless black and endless potential.

"Ding." The vibration of the bell tore through me completely, splitting my mind like an axe but bringing only instantaneous clarity and focus.

I tore the blindfold from me eyes and rose in one second of perfect action.  When I realized that the entire cemetery was entirely and exceedingly empty I only smiled knowingly.  I knew what I was here for, what had lead me to this point in time.  I performed.

I performed with every bit of my being, leaving nothing back.  The monologue was my reality.  The circle glowed with amber, smoky light and rose from the grass, surrounding me.  I could feel the grass growing towards me ever so slightly as my mouth and person recited and emoted the content of the ritual.

And it was a ritual.

When I called the names inscribed in the circle it pulsed and expanded. When I called, the wind roared, a fiery ball glowed in the south, the creek behind me swelled, and in the north the earth shook. Glaring up at the heavens and demanding the light made the stars supernova before my eyes. They danced, and swirled and spun. When I knelt to the ground it rose up to meet me as my legs made their home under the soil.

I called upon the watchers and was awestruck by the multitude of light glowing orbs starting to fill the woods around me.  I saw them turn, some low and some high but all eyes on me.  That's when I noticed my own radiance. I was lighting the area and as I performed all light was coming to me, building up in my chest until I almost couldn't bear it.

"Byleth, I demand you presence in true form and with no ill intention.  Byleth, show yourself!"

He did.

Suddenly I heard a blast of trumpets and horns, settling into a full orchestra of energetic music which I can in no way describe to you.  My eyes began to weep at the incredibly foul smell that filled the air about me like burning hair and ammonia.  Keeping myself from fleeing the stench and leaving the circle I steeled myself and forced my eyes open.

Through the tears and confusion I saw the shape of a hooded man riding a pale horse.  Suddenly the image shifted, like turning a mirrored corner and I saw an enormous toad,  He was decked out with gold jewelry and holding a spear like a large thorned rose stem. The frog opened his mouth and turning inside out, became a panther. The head of the panther emerged from the toads throat and carried the former body into the new as it lept toward me.

"The man on the Horse!" I stated gruffly. Calming I repeated "Take the form of the man on the horse."  This was where I left the script completely knowing that from here on out it would be my show.

It did.

The man's eyes burned red as he stared down at me from this steed.  He stood silent.

I knew what to do.  I commanded he Daemon.  I convinced and put this creature under my command, fully.  That's why I was here.  That is why D. found me. That is why Ella trained me and lead me down this road.  I know that now.  This was a setup from the start aimed at me, but not against me.

D. and Ella, and the others who appeared after my work was complete.  They are nothing but love and power.  They want for nothing, yet work tirelessly for those around them who show promise.  They scour the sewers of the world and when they find potential, they nurture and develop it.

I am one of them now.  And we are many.  Many of us all around you.  Dressed like beggars and businessmen. Floating in and out of the most mundane of places.  We are true spiritual evolution, commanding forces beyond comprehension. 

This world is a play and are writers. 

Until the day we meet.

[[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4zuz33/i_called_something_up_please_help_part_2/)]


I slipped the key into the lock, and walked into an unbelievable apartment.  D.'s place was amazing inside even though it just looked like another Baltimore warehouse on the outside. This place was a capitalist dream with huge full wall-sized windows, granite counter tops, stainless steel everything and just clean modern lines everywhere.  

After taking a tour and checking out the bedroom and bathroom (most of the place was open space including the kitchen and main area) I checked the fridge.  I always got a bit hungry after drinking and this was no exception.  In the front of the top shelf of the fridge was a big covered dish which I grabbed and opened on the counter.

"Oh, Fuck yes!" I let out to the empty apartment.

The casserole dish was absolutely filled with the most beautiful looking bud I have ever seen.  There must have been 2 ounces of weed in there and I was smacked with that overwhelming smell of quality.  I didn't need an invitation, but there was a small business card with a note on it, stating simply "Help Yourself" with a pack of rolling papers affixed to the back.

I twisted one up, kicked back on the leather couch and looked out over the city for hours.  I was feeling beyond great, such a strange overwhelming happiness after the shit that happened earlier.  It's strange, this was clearly temporary, but I just felt like a King hanging in this ridiculous pad, all the bud I could smoke, food in the fridge.... and oh fuck!  A bathtub!

I leapt off the couch, made sure the door was locked and headed for the bathroom.  I can't remember the last time I took a bath.  The A-worx had a shower stall that used to be some sort of chemical wash station.  As you can imagine, it's not the most impressive or luxurious shower in the world, and the water was often brown or cold, or both.

Getting setup and turning on the lights, I started to play with the extra switches on the wall. I kid you not, one of them heated the towels hanging by the clawfoot, and the other heated the goddamned floor.  This was the shit. I filled the tub, and soaked for a long time finished off my J-bar.  I don't think I've ever been this relaxed in my entire life.  

Shit anyway, I'm getting all caught up in this.  The place and everything about it was just ridiculous and incredible. I got clean, fed, stoned and swooned into that big white bed to sleep like I haven't in years.

I remember dreaming that night.  I dreamed that I was walking towards the A-worx from a couple blocks away and started noticing this big black dark figure in front of it.  Near him I could see that part of the building was colored this rich gold color and as I got closer I could see the arm of the figure moving up and down.  This thing was like nine feet tall and painting the A-worx pure gold, but no matter how much closer I got, I could not make out who or what it was.  It seems to just suck in light and only ever appear to be pitch black.  Then it dipped it's brush again, raised it's arm and started a new section, only this one was crimson.  I stopped dead.  The person or beast or whatever, licked the red brush, dipped it again, and then started covering the crimson color in gold. Then it started to turn towards me slowly.  I could only make out the silhouette but when that slow turning movement was recognized I awoke very suddenly with my heart pounding, covered in sweat.

I grabbed up the covers around me instantly and pressed my back into the headboard, absolutely shocked to find someone in the room with me.

"Don't you say hello?" The look she gave me was almost cold, not a trace of humor in her face, like a challenge.

"Um. Hello."

Then she smiled, a wicked sarcastic grin.  "You kinda look like a conservative suburban housewife all wrapped in your blankets like that.  Ok, shy-boy. why don't you get dressed." She turned and closed the bedroom door behind her.

I jumped up and grabbed my clothes from the floor   quickly got dressed and headed into the main space where I found using her cell-phone on the couch. She put it away and looked back as I came into the room.

"Hmmm... cool gettup." She thought for a minute "Cuter without it though."

I looked down at the dirty, worn denim, spikes and patches that I had been wearing since I was 16, weirdly feeling a bit ashamed.  Maybe it was the contrast with this place, or the way that this girl pulled off goth and class at the same time.  She was skinny with black hair and this little black dress that was just between alternative and cocktail party.  She was probably about 19 or 20 and really fucking cute.

"So. Who are you?" I asked.

"Such a wide and esoteric question!" with lots of snark "I will assume that what you are asking is more like what is my name and why am I here right now.  My name is Ella and I care-take for D.'s apartment while he travels."

"Oh, he mentioned someone watching the place."

"And you must be Jason.  D. told me that you are an actor. What is it that you love about pretending to be someone you're not?"

This lead to hours of really crazy deep conversation.  Ella was insanely intelligent and did not hold back whatsoever.  She was totally bad-ass and impressive.  We ended up rolling another joint, then making drinks and food, and generally relaxed and got to know each other. After dinner she kissed me, and things went on from there.  By 8pm we were sleeping together and frankly life was fucking wonderful.  

Laying in bed with her, listening to my heartbeat start to slow she turned to me.

"You should practice your script." It was a statement rather than a question.

"It can wait." I let out with a sigh. 

She jumped up on top of me. and grabbed my face with her hands.

"Go practice your script, and in an hour we'll be ready to get back in this bed."

Her eyes seemed to gleam with this beautiful amber light, moving and shifting.  She was so beautiful, there was no way I could say no to her.

"Okay.  I'll use the main room and be back."

I was a bit uncomfortable at first performing with her in the house.  It's ridiculous, I know.  I had no trouble with an anonymous crowd, but knowing that my new girl who I just met could hear me performing made me really self-conscious.

I grabbed the script and setup some space in the big open main room, took a second to relax and got started.  At this point I had memorized most of the material so I was able to flow a bit better than before not having to continually read from the script.  Soon I started to feel my anxiety let go, and the more I tried to remember the lines, the more they came to me naturally.  Before I knew it I was cruising through most of the performance almost entirely on autopilot.  I did however try to focus more on feeling and emotion since I seemed to have memorization down.

As I got to about three quarters of the way through, I started hearing this little noise.  At first I thought it may just be random voices from the street outside, every few minutes.  Then it got louder and it sounded more like someone being hurt and letting out gasps.  I tried to ignore it but my mind kept focusing on it as I started to reach the culmination of the performance.  My heart started beating hard. I started feeling overheated while the room felt like it was getting colder by the minute and all the while the noise began increasing now, becoming rhythmic.  I was confused with my attention split between what I was doing and that noise which I now placed in the bedroom.

As the play crescendo-ed it became clear that the noise was Ella reaching orgasm in the next room. She was reaching the point of fury during my final lines and this energy just overtook me.  I began shouting the final part.

"Appear now before me! Appear!" I shouted, heart pumping and sweat dripping from my forehead.  I felt like I was both here and in the bedroom with Ella, fucking her hard at the same time. 

I took hold of myself and ran into the room to see her, legs clenched, eyes rolled back in her head and just racked with pleasure.  I just wanted to be with her so bad and got into bed to hold her and put my hands on her alabaster body.

"Jason, yessss. That was wonderful" she sighed in a long exhale.

 I laid there caressing her, overtaken with this lovely creature.  I ran my fingers through the contours of her body, gripping her neck with my other hand for almost an hour until blackness took over and both of us fell asleep, wrapped in each other's tangle of limbs.

I jolted upright in bed, startled by this incredibly loud noise.  I cannot begin to explain what it sounded like, but it was as if a Lion was in the bedroom with us, right behind the headboard.  The roar was incredibly loud and intense seeming to shake the woodblock pictures on the walls.  For a second I was shocked and confused beyond belief, before laying back down, realizing that I must have had a crazy intense dream.  I had had night terrors as a child, but it had been years since I experienced something quite that intense flowing into waking reality like that.  I began falling back to sleep when I heard Ella whisper in my ear.

"Jason, you've done it, he's come" </TEXT>

Ok, I'm gonna try to get caught up to the current time period so that I can get some advice from you guys.  Big Ups to the people who already responded, I'm starting to think that you guys are right and there might actually be something to this ritual in the play. Anyway I want to thank you all for the response, and I'm hoping I can get some more info on how I should proceed.

So I left off about a week or two in after meeting D. Since then a lot has gone down.  I told you all that we had just really terrible shit go down with my old friend overdosing, fights among everyone at A-worx, etc.  It was a nasty few weeks, but I kept at my practice as much as possible between the back to back shit-storms.

Honestly at that point, closing myself in my room and studying and acting in the play started to become like a refuge from all the other shit going on.  It started to seem like every time I entered my room with the intention to practice, all the crap that was going on in my life would just fall away and I felt great for the next couple hours.  It was strange, just walking through my door started to give me that warm feeling, like popping just one or two Oxy's or something. So I kept at it.

I practiced more and more the next few weeks, and more and more it was the best part of my day.  While that was going on though, the A-worx was changing a lot.  We lost more than half of our regulars who had been crashing there for years and we starting pulling in new people.  Mostly these were squatters for the south and mid-west, coming in on train cars. A lot of them had dogs which was pretty common for this crew, so soon the A-worx had about 13 tenants and 5 German shepherds.  This crew was a bit more fucked up than our standard mix though, most were long term heroin users (we always had a few nodders but the balance increased) and a lot of them were older than our normal crowd.

Anyway, I'm just saying that the vibe really started to change.  We went from a bunch of energetic, younger anarchist kids to this crew of 30 and even 40-something addict drifters.  It started to affect everything.  Some of the guys were dealing from the space attracting a lot of gang members from the city, and the police starting showing up asking about robberies near our block.  Mostly the cops were cool and didn't mess with us about the space or how we were living (no rules and regs shit) but I was always the one to speak to them and they were getting more and more pushy about the newer people staying there.

And of course it came to a head about a week later (about three weeks from the date scheduled for the play.)  I was in my room practicing, just at the end of the ritual and culmination of the play, demanding over and over that Byleth appear before me and do my "bidding" or whatever.  And right at that moment with me feeling really strong and good about the role, putting all this emotional energy into, a fucking gunshot rings out.

I dropped the persona and ran outside to see Red running to some of the back rooms, covering his stomach with his hand and pouring blood on the floor.  Two more shots ring out and I see the shooter, some 20-something gang-banger with sweat pants on trying to take him out as he ran.  I took cover   dropped until the dude stooped down, grabbed a bag and took off down the hall to the exit.

"Motherfucker!" a few of the others started yelling.  

One of them headed down the hall after the shooter (fucking idiot) while me and the others started headed towards Red.  We followed his trail of blood in, out and around the sectioned out spaces at the west end of our space.  I hadn't been back in those small spaces for a while, since the new squatter crew had settled in that end of the space and mostly tried to keep to themselves.  When I got there I instantly regretted that, being a long term member I should have been better about checking up.

So we find Red sprawled out at the back of the western-most space, surrounding by broken glass and there's smoke pouring into the air around him.  I knew what was up immediately cuz a friend of mine who I won't name used to have a lab in his apartment.  These guys must have been cooking meth out of this room for a while.  The realization came about as fast as the flames starting rising from the growing pools of mixed liquids on the floor.  

I gotta tell you, you always hear people talking about flames "licking you".  I get it now.  The fire started on the floor a few feet away from me, and within a couple seconds they leapt and "licked" the side of my face.  I was out fast.  Red must have been dead already and even if not he was most certainly fucked. There were a few minutes as I headed to the slop sink where I thought we'd be able to put out the fire. Two minutes later the place was a tinder box and all of us ran to escape the building.  But I grabbed one single thing first, the script.  It was the only irreplaceable thing I owned and was foremost on my mind.

That was the end of the A-worx.  Everyone staying there scattered into the city to avoid questioning, including myself. 

It was a weird feeling. I was pretty fucked up honestly.  There I was just walking block after block in a straight line from what had been my home for years, holding this script and almost nothing else.  I had nowhere to go, no idea what to do about the fire, being that I was on the lease.  I had nothing and nowhere to crash.  I had spent a summer like this years back, sleeping at the train station or trying to catch shut-eye in the city parks when the weather was good, but that shit gets old fast.  I was not ready to go back to that, but had no options.  I started thinking about who I might be able to couch surf with, or trying to ask around about local squats.

What I really wanted though was to get a bit lit to calm me down.  I had no weed, pills or anything else on me, they were all in my backpack which definitely did not exist any more. I started looking for working payphones which were pretty rare at this point when I passed Dirty Fred's bar.  This was one of my favorite hangouts and I quickly decided that the $40 i had on me was best spent there. Yeah, I'm smart.

I walk in amidst the awesome typical blast of music (The Germs, I love this bar) and smoke and noise and I stop in my tracks dumbfounded.  Sitting in the booth closest to the entrance is Fucking D!  He was just sitting there alone with both hands wrapped around his glass of Scotch like he was waiting for me.

"Jason" he looked up and invited me to the seat next to him. He turned his head and said in a low voice that I could barely hear "One more for my friend."

I have no idea how the bartender could hear him over the din in that place but I was seated and drinking scotch with D. in like two seconds.  I couldn't even form a sentence, and had no compunction for small talk.

"How are things?" he savored a sip in his mouth and waited patiently.

"The piece is going well, I'm really feeling it. I think you'll like my work" I struggled to give him an update "What are you doing here?"

 "I'm just having a drink before I leave for Boston. I trust that the play is going well. I trust you.  I was asking how you were, personally."

"Well, not too good.  The A-worx is on fire. Like right now as we speak." I blurted.

"That is unfortunate." calm and understated.  He stopped for a moment and seemed to be thinking. "I suppose that you might need a place to stay, and an advance on your payment."

"My payment?" I was astounded.

"Yes, True art is valuable.  You are performing true art. Let's see." He again paused, tapping his glass slowly.  "I do have someone who has agreed to check in on my Baltimore apartment while I am gone, but I suppose under the circumstances..."

D. reached into his suit jacket and took out a checkbook and started writing. Then he did the same with a small pad, and pushed a check, a note and a key to me over the table.

"Here is the address, and a $500 advance for food and clothing. You are welcome to stay there as long as you wish. I don't expect to be back until our little performance and even then I'll be staying with friends in the Historical House."

"Shit, I can't..." I started.

"Shit you can, and will.  You must understand that I mean to make a fair deal of impact and money from this performance, and it's subsequent showings.  You will be further compensated after the play and I think that you will be very happy with what I have in mind, now that I know your situation."

"What  do you mean?" I was both excited, and honestly feeling a bit greedy.  I hadn't expected any payment but D. made it seem like I'd really get something out of this.

"I was going to wait to tell you this, but I suppose under the circumstances it is only fair." He looked me in the eyes, holding a stare. "I am in town because I just finished acquiring another building in the city.  My hope was to develop this into an community building dedicated to performance art.  If things go well, I will grant you a ten year lease for one floor of the building at no cost, and you may if you wish, re-assemble your little community."

"I don't know what to say." I really didn't. This was crazy and I was both confused and excited that within minutes of losing something I had worked on for years, it was destroyed and being given back to me.  I'd be able to do so much without having to pay rent.  The new A-worx could use the money it raises for outreach, an improved free book program for local prisons, funding for "Food not Bombs", all kinds of shit.

"Then say nothing.  Finish your drink, maybe get another, and get some sleep. But I must go. I have a flight to catch." He rose quickly.

"Wait" I tried to stop him. "The play. The ritual in the play, what is it?  Where did you get it?"

He stopped only for a moment. "Jason.  You should know better.  Pure art is mystery.  Live in the mystery and I will answer all of your questions once the performance is over.  Until the Sixth, my friend." He left quickly.

I did have another drink. And then I had another two.  

I kept looking out the window, fearing that the police or firemen would find me any moment and start to question me, but they never came.  I just sat and stewed for hours thinking.  My life really had gone to shit since I accepted this part, there was no denying that.  I started thinking about all the implications, thinking about doing this ritual in the play over and over and everything falling apart around me.  This is the point where I really started to mentally connect everything, but what could I do?

I had nothing left, except for what D. gave me. And I had to put on the performance to get back what I had.  I was worried, but I was on a path.  There was only one good outcome in sight at this point.  Buckle down, do the play whatever it took and then I could put my life back together, brand new with better opportunities.

I think that's all I can share tonight. I didn't even manage to get to tell you about the apartment, Dervish, or about my friend's girl Camilla yet but I've gotta pack it in for the night, I'm exhausted and I have to get one more practice in before I crash out.

Promise to write more soon and get you up to date before the performance.  Cheers everyone and thanks for the feedback.  I know you guys are right, but man.... I don't think I have any option here.
