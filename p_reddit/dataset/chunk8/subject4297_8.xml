	<TEXT> Yea I totally agree, but I'm really just longing for a really really perfect factions experience, something I haven't seen in a few years. My goal is to support a community of about 100 people, who are all social and very competetive. I want battles and big raids and betrayals and allies and not just some random people fucking arround who won't talk to each other or fight anywhere but right outside of spawn. Thanks for the advice man!
