	<TEXT> They uh... are really, really in trouble with the repeal. They had 8 years of screaming to repeal it. Now they finally can. First they were going to do it in a few days. Then a few weeks. Now Trump says not until the end of the year/sometime next year.   
  
I almost wonder if they didn't oppose it and make it a boogeyman simply to whip up hatred against Obama and feed teaparty rancor, and that they only meant the "repeal" part of "repeal and replace" -- they never actually thought out what "replace" was going to be.   
  
We're all very curious Republicans, what, in those 8 years, did you propose? While meanwhile, *millions* gained healthcare, expanding to the greatest number of folks covered ever. While *millions* who would have been denied coverage because of pre-existings were getting coverage. While kids were able to stay on their parents coverage until 26 (something I myself benefited from).  
  
While all that was happening, and you were screaming about how evil it was, did you remember to think of "replace"?  
  
Go ahead, and replace it. Do it. And we will replace you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their hammering on John Podesta is insane. It's like how close to doxxing can you get without doing it? Imagine, if you have to, that he's innocent and has thousands and thousands of people in a fever dream over him being a pedophile. Imagine if you had thousands of people everyday calling you a pedophile. And these people have already been shown to bring rifles into places for no reason. /R/conspiracy is now complacent in this proxy doxing. Massive witch hunts of individuals based on flimsy evidence. Do you need to provide an address to dox? I don't think so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got kicked out of conspiracy (which has become /r/pizza_gate) for saying that all they talked about was pizza. The mods have removed Trump-Russia pieces when they were at the top. I called them out for this. I got banned, [basically for being conspiratorial.](http://i.imgur.com/JVzAyKR.png) When I asked why I got banned, "Why did I get banned?" I got banned from messaging the mods. /r/pizza_gate isn't dead. It's just /r/conspiracy now. In fact, they have an /r/pizza_gate post stickied. </TEXT>

Also, I just want to note something *very* very important. I was hoping this would happen, but to anyone who has protested, or spoken out in any way, even folks in Iran, even conservatives [have taken notice](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/middleeast/iran-trump-burn-flag.html) that there has been extreme backlash against Trump. They are seeing that he is not speaking for us. It is wonderful that even their traditionally reactionary side is acknowledging that this guy is not speaking for us.

	<TEXT> Dear Senator Thurmond:  
I write to express my sincere opposition to the confirmation of Jefferson B. Sessions as a federal district court judge for the Southern District of Alabama. My professional and personal roots in Alabama are deep and lasting. Anyone who has used the power of his office as United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to our courts. Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not be rewarded with a federal judgeship.  
I regret that a long-standing commitment prevents me from appearing in person to testify against this nominee. However, I have attached a copy of my statement opposing Mr. Sessions confirmation and I request that my statement as well as this be made a part of the hearing record.  
I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of Mr. Sessions.  
Sincerely,  
Coretta Scott King </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It makes total sense. Nazis are fucklords. You are justifying Nazis. Think about that. People weren't calling them Nazis... they were *actually* Nazis. You are saying self-avowed Nazis should be allowed to spread their ideas, and doxx people. These are people who would extinguish entire races. You are saying those are ideas that should be allowed to grow. You are supporting the promulgation of facist ideology. Congrats, you are defending Nazis.  </TEXT>

Those feeling somewhat uncomfortable with how this administration has played out.. You are going to have a hell of a time defending him the coming years (days?) you will lose friends when people automatically think you're a moron for buying his snake oil. You will find yourself having to defend increasinly bizarre and anti-american ideas. However, admit you were wrong, and folks will forgive you. No one will hold it against you. Mistakes happen, he did sell masterfully. But if you've seen through the charade now, feel no obligation to continue to defend him. You have every right to be outraged too. Defending this man, choosing to believe this, will increasingly strain your life, as the paucity of his principals becomes more evident. And as you see just how poorly snake oil burns. </TEXT>
