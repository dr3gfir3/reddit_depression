It's not so much him as a writer - I guess he's an acquired taste - but the unwarranted adulation. I used to feel the same (but worse) about Martin Amis back in the day - and he's a far worse writer than Tibn who at least has craft. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I used to be really into Hollinghurst. I tend to like individual books rather than individual writers but I have to read a lot of modern stuff as I'm a book dealer. 

Massive fan of Murakami and Chandler, classic noir and Golden Age crime. Heavily into Swedish/Scandi gothic crime right now but it's nothing highbrow lol. 

Personally I think the modern novel is dead, very rare for any (Western anyway) writer to be able to put their finger on the pulse. They always seem to come from their own perspective (Safran Foer cough) when they try it. Where are the writers that explain ourselves to ourselves? I'd much rather a Dostoevsky or Knut Hamsun than most people writing today. Except maybe Stephen King or a great crime writer like Jake Arnott or Tana French. Crime is having a rennaissance right now. Lol. </TEXT>

There's a whole host of these characters (and I say this as a rabid leftie of sorts) who are lauded by the Guardianistas just because they *have* to be, not on account of their writing but on account of they're fitting a certain demographic which panders to their liberal world view.

	<TEXT> Put it this way. If you try to do a spell - say to meet a woman within the week - and that week you meet no women.... imo it is because you are performing a *stronger* subconscious magic to NOT meet women. 

Just because such a person *thinks* they want something doesn't mean they really do want that thing. People can study all the magic they want but if they don't know what REALLY motivates them and REALLY know their own selves they will get nowhere. 

We always get what we want. And the means of us getting it is (imo) a magical process.

	<TEXT> I would argue it is meaningless. Even for those who think it isn't they invariably have to pare it down to different paths, methods, schools whatever. 

The only reason we can't lump 'everyday life' in with all these different (and often opposing) magical formulations is that the vast majority of people have no idea they are creating their own reality and would oppose the idea. 

The only difference between them and the 'magician' is that the magician is more aware of the possibilities. Even that's not always true as sometimes religious minded people can sometimes perform super-normal actions if they ascribe them to God.

	<TEXT> Adnan can't or won't say so because he's close to getting out, or at least thinks he is.

Is this logical or rational as an argument? I think not... let's dissect it:

He *might* be close to getting out now but this is because of the podcast. For over a decade and a half he has been nowhere near getting out. 

So is this an explanation for his silence during that extended period of time? Clearly not... it cannot possibly apply. 

So what would be the reasons for him 'not saying' before the advent of Serial? Or does that not matter? I think we know the answer here...

	<TEXT> Cheers, it's not a popular piece of advice I think and there's a reason for that. It is a nuclear attack on the ego. 

It all comes down to whether one thinks that 'will power' is the result of building up the ego or controlling it (I don't mean destroying it, that would be stupid!). Either you control it or it controls you... imo, if it controls you then you can't have will power but that might be just me. 

Also check out the Cynics - a magical school if ever there was one, despite not having that reputation.

* The goal of life is eudaimonia and mental clarity or lucidity () - freedom from smoke () which signified ignorance, mindlessness, folly, and conceit.
* Eudaimonia is achieved by living in accord with Nature as understood by human reason.
* Arrogance () is caused by false judgments of value, which cause negative emotions, unnatural desires, and a vicious character.
* Eudaimonia, or human flourishing, depends on self-sufficiency (), equanimity, arete, love of humanity, parrhesia and indifference to the vicissitudes of life ().[11]
* One progresses towards flourishing and clarity through ascetic practices () which help one become free from influences  such as wealth, fame, and power  that have no value in Nature. Examples include Diogenes' practice of living in a tub and walking barefoot in winter.
* A Cynic practices shamelessness or impudence () and defaces the nomos of society; the laws, customs, and social conventions which people take for granted.

Note that last point!

	<TEXT> Because what some believers see in religion, many atheists are incapable of perceiving - they are colour-blind to the essence of spirituality, they just can't see it. 

In some ways they are 100% correct when they say it does not exist and is 'made up' - for them it is. Absolutely. The problems occur when they don't realise their condition and start Crusading for their Truth... which is only true for them. 

To be fair though, many 'believers' are blind to the essence of spirituality too: fundies of all kinds, Islamist extremists, US evengelicals etc.... they are drawn to a religious framework for other reasons and perhaps do not even really believe it... certainly they are not in tune with the spiritual core.

The letters have a numerical equivalent and could also be the correspondence to some djinn or entity or whatever. You'd need a table of correspondences to work out which and what.

Not sure if you're Muslim but the way to get rid of any such effects for a Muslim is outlined here:

https://sarkarhealings.wordpress.com/how-to-break-black-magic/

You might not be comfortable with that but, as I say, I don't think there is any reason to think it is malicious. 

My advice would be to meditate and center yourself and be very aware for 24 hours or so. See if any good or bad things out of the ordinary happen. Try to discern things in an objective way. DON'T allow yourself to give any power to this that it doesn't have.... Just be objective and rational and test the water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You mean an anti Nationalist mindset conditioned in the UK populace for decades by lies and denigration by the left.

No, I really don't. **YOU** think that yourself and need to justify it. But you're wrong on both counts. 

It was only thanks to the out of step actions of the unlikely hero David Beckham that we were "allowed" to wave the English flag again

Oh dear. Where to start? No-one ever stopped you so 'allowed' is a misnomer. Britain First and the EDL have been waving it for over a decade. But I get the impression you probably are well aware of that.

You do not need to involve Nationalism when you so clearly have the french and Germans acting against you and your people

'So clearly' - well, if you read the Daily Mail maybe. 

it is clearly an attack by enemies.

Umm... ok.... fight them on the beaches?

Any separatist politic anywhere inevitably has a large amount of prejudice and self interest at the core, sold to the fools in the crowd as benefit to them, really just to benefit the people, friends and family of the new level of new government.

I don't hear them saying that though, don't hear them saying that they're engaging in a campaign of Civil Disobedience. They seem to be saying the law is not a law because they don't like it.

	<TEXT>  but to be honest, i pick a popular sovereign mistake to an autocratic and paternalistic one any day of the week.

Those aren't the choices though. They are what you are *told* are the choices. 

Millions of people apparently voted for Trump as 'a kick in the teeth for the elite' but soon they will see he IS the elite. I hope. Because everyone else can see it. 

The current system is dead. We need to make new ones. We don't do that by arguing for any of the choices that currently exist whether left, right, paternalist or any other thing that you can currently see on the table. 

The thing that we need does not exist yet. We need to create it. We will be able to do that when we reject *everything* currently on the menu and stop trying one or the other.

	<TEXT> I'm saying that a Nationalist mindset conditioned the UK populace over decades with lies and it went un-countered to such a degree that Cameron had no choice but to go with a referendum and then more lies and propaganda was foisted on the populace and in the end the current anti-thinking Zeitgeist did the rest. 

Tl;dr: the referendum result was not the result of a rational thinking process and I am drawing parallels with the situation here. </TEXT>

Yep... very.

Many things are these days... why people vote for Brexit and Trump too. All simple. Nothing complicated here at all. 

Everyone 'wants' something. But that alone does not justify the thing itself. No doubt many Brexit voters 'wanted' something (I think it was 'their country back') that too, is quite simple. 

Always has been. It was the Letimotif of Europe throughout the 20th century. But simplicity too can be outmoded.  </TEXT>

They'll be finally overtaken by events and forced to take notice when Le Pen and the National Front win France in a couple of months. 

Nationalism is as outmoded as Calvinism as an ideology for living by and, though there are people among us who will never arrive at that fact through reason, current events will spell it out in the most painful ways for all of us pretty soon.  </TEXT>

Which gives an idea of why the groups are as you find them and the ones that aren't need strict enforcement of rules. That alone should tell you something.

Maybe in a FB group for plumbers or car mechanics your chances would be much higher but the question then would be: 'would I recognise an Occultist who does not advertise as being one and, if I did, would I want to even associate if they refused to discuss Occultism?' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Occult to me is a generic term which lumps lots of things together... one of them is 'Magic' which I suspect you mean in some way? 

I can only address magic anyway as it's the only thing I have experience of in the 'Occult' rubric. 

To me it represents a refuge from increasingly dogmatic organised religion and materialistic paradigms like scientism and atheism - I feel disenfranchised from all those groups though I have a lot in common with them... it's more that they define the 'rules of admission' too rigidly and then exclude someone of my ideological stance on the basis of them. For example I believe in the teaching of Christ but hold that many 'Christians' are not in fact Christians...but they are the vast majority and have been for nearly 2000 years so I can't argue it... it's me who needs to grab my coat. Ditto with Islam though I identify as a Muslim. Still, that does not stop others labelling me as a bad one though the Islamic community is much better in this regard than the Christian one... the problem there is the non-Muslims who have some anti-Islam agenda or have misconceptions.  

Given all that, magic is to me a place where I am free to define myself and 'build my own' belief system. Ironically this is exactly what orthodox Muslims and Christians do too (and get it wrong imo) but in the magical community you are far more free as the vast majority of people are more tolerant and accepting. Not all but by far the majority. 

We're all just 'rolling our own' here and I think that's the beauty of it.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a late 2012 iMac and am thinking of getting a new MacBook Air or maybe Pro (not sure about that) - in any case I want to use the iMac as a monitor on some occasions to save me buying another monitor. I have a couple of questions:

1) Is this a viable plan for writing and occasional coding? The iMac will work satisfactorily in this way right? 

2) Assuming it does, would it be possible to use the iMac's hard drive as an external drive from the laptop while it is in use as a monitor?

3) Any other reasons why this is not (or is) a viable plan? 

Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes... I often thought this. If you dig deeper you can see other slip-ups too.

At one point he says "I didn't kill Hae...."

The last two words of this are **KILL HAE** and the first word is "I" - if you remove 'didn't' then this is chillingly like the "I'm going to kill note" which we know is the start of a list he made planning out the murder or possibly intended to be used to taunt the cops later. 

It could even - though we'll probably never know for sure - be the first step of an attempt to get in the Guinness Book of Records for the highest number of victims murdered and got away with.... Hae being the first of a projected total of 100,000 (curiously the same number of dollars he stole from the mosque... perhaps he was mastering various forms of crime and the '100,000' was his trademark... he simply graduated from drugs to theft to murder - or maybe this is a significant number in Pakistani Muslamic lore?)

He just wasn't as clever as he thought he was. They never are. The really scary thing is though that in those days there was no internet to catch master criminals like the Golden Boy. Nowadays he'd think twice before trying this with the advances in Reddit and stuff.  </TEXT>

Basically you go out of your way to be blamed for things - things you didn't actually do works best. Or perhaps behave in a way that gets you a bad rep but also hurts you to do. Lose your friends, make everyone think you're mad by acting like a loon - but never break character... just suck it up and be seen as a cracked loser.

	<TEXT> I agree. It is very worrying. But I think the only thing we can do is to be more vocal with our own 'versions' of magic, religion, reality and strive to accept everyone else's version in the spirit of appreciating art. 

I had a bit of a revelation myself this morning when I woke up to Trumpmageddon.... it really doesn't matter if you're NOT living your destiny and putting your voice out there. Add if you ARE doing that then Trump (or whoever) doesn't matter either. We all need to just do our thing, whatever that may be, and do it more vocally and more forcefully... just choose your art form and put it out there. 

Also important is to not oppose others who are doing the same. We need to appreciate each other's vision no matter how different it is... just my 2c but I get the strong feeling those of us in tune with 'alternative realities' can't afford the luxury of division any more. 

Thanks for your thanks btw... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was pretty convinced he'd win. If you look at history it's cyclic. You can predict it if you know where you are on the cycle. Actually lots of magic in the sense of predictions works like this. 

In this case you have a certain public mood brewing in the US and Europe for years since 911. At the first opportunities it will manifest. Brexit was the first in the UK and now Trump in the US.

Next opportunity will be France. For sure the National Front will win and very likely in the Netherlands too. 

We're mapped to around 1933 - 1935 imo. Europe will descend into some form of chaos. US will stand aloof for a while but get sucked in. Maybe 10 years or so.

	<TEXT> Ok, I get you. 

I tend to take a slightly different view though I agree with many of your points. It seems to me that many people have voluntarily given up their 'free will' or 'ability to reason'. I don't mean just now... all through humanity.

These people are not - imo - really brainwashed as such because they have given up using their brains. They have - if you like - surrendered control and outsourced it to their 'leader of choice' which could be a politician, an ideology, a religion or whatever. 

My take is that there is no need for any subconscious programming for these people (ie the vast majority of humanity) because they just follow the prompts. The messages in the media aren't subconscious programming - they're orders! There's nothing to program. 

Magic oth is any discipline that stands outside this. Religion, magic, spirituality etc can all be things that are essentially groups of people who don't respond to the mainstream prompts. Though of course many of these things either BECOME the mainstream prompts (US Christianity for example) or are a mere replacement (cough MAGICAL ORDERS cough).

The true magician - imo - is one who is not subject to any prompts or directives from any source whatsoever other than those he creates for himself.

	<TEXT> Ok, what I mean is: what is your definition of magic?

You can't - or shouldn't - assume there is one over-arching definition and that consequently mine is the same as yours or vice versa. 

Therefore it's helpful (to me at least) if you define what yours is so I can evaluate your statement that "Subconscious programming is the very basis of magick."

For me it isn't remotely related but as I don't believe there is some absolute definition of anything - let alone magic - I'm interested in your version and what your magical perspective is.   </TEXT>

Don't think I ever mentioned the word 'mean' - a Guilter inserted that as a pejorative. I think that's probably why you don't understand.

I don't care about 'mean' - I'm more thinking like when you hear about a conspiracy and you think it could be possible so you head over to a community to check out their research and you have to back out the door slowly because they are all bat-shit crazy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's one reason why I'd go for innocence.  I should say in passing that I'd probably be leaning much more to guilt if it were not for the entirety (and I mean that - 100%) of the "Guilter Community".

It's not just that I can't bring myself to associate with them and the irrational insane toxicity which is their hallmark (though that's a part of it), it's more that when I lean to guilt, as I often do, I just have to read the leading Guilter arguments and remind myself that this is *all there is*. The Crme de la crme of the arguments. 

But I digress..... here from the OP is a summation of my current stance:

Witness with details of the crime, 

Who contradicts himself on numerous occasions to the degree we don't know exactly which scenario to believe. Sure we could cherry-pick (and the Guilters do) the one that feels best for the argument of the moment or we could just put all the conflicting scenarios in a basket (as the OP does) and call it 'a strong witness' but I'm kind of not morally, ethically and intellectually able to do it in support of a Guilty argument.

lack of an alibi, 

But for what? Which scenario? Again depends on which one you're cherry-picking and of course also necessitates **Denying** the Asia alibi and saying 'there is no alibi' which, again, bears no relation to my idea of objective assessment. So no dice here either. 

the note, 

Hahahahah

the lies 

One lie. Again, lying isn't really someone saying something you have decided on no evidence to be not true. 

The one lie about the ride is - to my mind with knowledge of the Muslim community - something I would do also. Have done more or less. There's a reason given for the lie. You can believe it or not but to leave it out is - again - not really objective. 

and contradictiond in thr files in the other sub.

Not sure what this means... seems somehow garbled but I think the above points still stand. 

I think it was Nietzsche who said (though I can't find the quote right now) something like "first comes the belief - then comes the *reason* for the belief"

I think what he meant was that humans mostly believe things based on conditioned bias - it is irrational and they know it is irrational. Because of this knowledge they strive to 'justify' it after the fact but not from assessment - the process is very different from what it would be if the process was helping them ARRIVE at truth rather than PROVE a truth.

You can see this at work every day in every atheist or religious argument for their own point of view. 

It's like if I am convinced the OP is a two-headed monopod from the planet Tharg - if he denies it then I have the proof that 'he is a liar' and this proves his part in the secret alien invasion plan.

	<TEXT> I know there is zero chance of ever getting a matte screen back but my old matte-screen MBP is biting the dust and I need to get a new one.

Does anyone know whether the new MBP screens will be better than they were a few years back? Last time I used one they were far too glossy and reflective for me - to the point of being a dealbreaker. 

Oth my partner has a Macbook Air 13" and the screen on that seems liveable with and much better than the last MBPs I checked out. It's not matte but it doesn't seem that glossy or reflective either. 

Does anyone know if the upcoming release of the MBP will feature the same screen?

	<TEXT> Yeah well they're both playing the same game - it's called "Outmoded Ideas oF Empire and the Nation State".

I'd be more interested if people found new ways to self-ideate and make wholesale change for populations... as indeed they are doing in places where the old mindset is not so ingrained. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What alternatives are you talking about? It's either remaining in Spain or leaving.

Lol.... genius!! My point exactly! You can't see any because 'Independence' is no longer a possible answer to a specific problem but a Holy Cow in and of itself. 

It has become the question when it should be a possible answer to a question. That's what Nationalism does and why it's pernicious and never a solution.

	<TEXT> I don't know anything to be honest. But strangely, in some ways on this issue I know everything... we all do.

There won't ever be a rational debate about the *alternatives* to Independence - it's classic reductionist either/or.

	<TITLE> Possibilities of monetising a 'Paranormal' blog </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, no need for any comments slagging-off the Paranormal as woo-woo or whatever, this is strictly business (sorry to be pre-emptive but it seems sometimes necessary!).

I've been looking at starting a blog with the aim of getting to $5k per month in 2-3 years. Subjects I've considered are fashion, politics, Men's advice etc - most of the usual suspects.

I've been thinking of going more left-field though and trying to create a niche - hence the idea of this Paranormal approach, it seems fairly popular I guess. 

Does anyone think it would be possible to monetise such a blog with ads, Amazon affiliates and even possibly sponsors? 

I don't think it's been done successfully but could it be?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, of course not... but I was thinking more that as we all know this then it is kind of blatant that the title is more than somewhat disingenuous.

But then again, maybe it's just getting in practice as to how the amazing models of glorious Nation States and their amazing and honest politicians behave before joining their hallowed ranks?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I need to turn around a responsive site pretty quickly - got the design from the client and it needs to be exact. 

Probably going to have to use a framework here though I don't usually do that - any recs for a fairly neutral one which is easy to customise?

I'm steering away from Bootstrap here so any suggestions? </TEXT>

You either have it or you don't. 

Most wannabe Occultists don't but that's a different story. But imho, if you can achieve an end by supranormal means - any end - that's magic. That's all there is. 

Every stick has two ends and what's good for you is bad for someone else and that's how it goes. But an absolute 'good' and 'bad' - no.  </TEXT>
