	<TEXT> No he doesn't have $770. Unless you are claming he has absolutely ZERO expenses. and my exampe showed HE PAID TO HAVE HIS BARN FIXED.

So, he has $770 MINUS the cost of fixing his barn, minus the cost of running electricity to his barn, minus everything else. So, you are essentially saying that he has to have a 23% margin to BREAK EVEN.  

I mean that is simply ludicrous. But thank you for having opened my eyes to what a joke "FairTax" is. </TEXT>

I'm curious how reliable that information is? Can we take him at face value?

Fine, so when he pays to have his barn repaired, the guys who gets his money for that pays 23% of that in taxes.

	<TEXT> So, no deductions for expenses? The farmer has to pay for maintainence on his barn/chicken coops, eletricity and so forth, even if he is somehow miraculously growing all his own feed with no expenses. 

So, what happens in a business where expenses are up to 85% of his revenue? If he's giving the government 23% then he is 8% in the red.

And by the way, maintainance on his barn is certailny not a "used good", it's a service. So, what if he is too old to repair it himself and has to hire someone to do it? 

Like I said, this makes no sense to me at all.

	<TEXT> Oh, goddamit, you have no idea what you are talking about. 

Be warned, this is not a response to you, but to the casual lurker.

Borders as lines that define what government controls what land, and by extension the people living on that land, are very important. And keeping those borders secure from encroachment by other government who would seek to control the land behind them and the people living on that land is of paramount importance because that keeps governments/countries from going to war.

On the other hand, when countries use those same borders to inhibit the free flow of ideas, capital and so on - yes, even labour if countries agree to that - is also good. 

Why?

Because this contributes to the welfare of the people on all sides of these borders and that, too, reduces the chance of war.

Now, you can disagree on refugee issues and so on, but snide remarks like OP's really only serve to confuse the issue.

For example, in Hillary Clinton's often ridiculed remarks along the lines of dreaming of a day with no borders in the Westerm hemisphere, she meant the latter. A large secure and prosperous trading bloc. NOT anyone can flee to whereever they want. 

Again, whether or not governments actually adhere to these ideals is one thing. The powerful ones often step on the toes of the little parnters in such bloc - see Germany in the EU for example.

	<TEXT> A pro-Dem super PAC needs to focus on changing the mentality in the state. 

Mormons vote GOP not only because they are conservtive, but because the US government literally went to war again them in the 1800s and they remember that. Hence - they want no big government interfering. It's a different fish than the general "keep government out of my life and business" sentiments in other places.

Two, one of their prophets, E.T.Benson was a Bircher. And a lot of that leaked voer to the general Mormon population, since "when the prophet has spoken, the thinking has been done" vibes they have.

So, to coutner that, a Super PAC needs to focus ads on three main points:

1) Compassion. Stress the value of compassion and show that Dems support that value 100%. 

2) In fact, it's not a sin to vote for  Dem. Because a lot of them feel it borders on sin. After all, that prophet was a Republican right!?

3) Families. Present some great ads on families and the things families can do together that are related to government programs like visiting National Parks. Also, explain what Planned Parenthood is and why some people really need it. 

Also, go door to door with this message in pairs, dressed in white shirts and business slacks. Maybe even by bicycle. That'll get them.  </TEXT>

How in the world does anyone with two brain cells believe the average American has the ability to keep increasing their spending when their wages are stagnant, real household income is falling, **and Obamacare continues to siphon what little cash they might have.**

	<TEXT> So, let me get this right...

In order to troll a president who has no comprehension of the details that make policy difficult (see his 10 conversation with the Chinese leader), one "trolls" him with a quote that essentially says:

"From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. Why do they look petty from uo there?

Yeah, because you cannot see the details at all and think there is a super easy solution to everything. I mean, I get it, "petty" as in there is no reason for us to all disagree, but that's just like Trump saying "We should get along with Russia". 

Of course we should. But look at the details showing why we don't.

I think these people trolled themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, if at the very beginning he had said, "Of course we talked about the sanctions" he'd look much better.

And what I mean by that if "No shit, Sherlock, of course we talked about the sanctions. It's like the biggest economic topic in Russia because it hurts them. Everybody asks Americans - especially anyone remotely involved in politics about the sanctions."

*Then* he could say, "Now that doesn't mean I remember every conversation in detail. It'd be like asking ordinary Americans if they talked about Donald Trump on Nov 9, 2016. Of course they did."

"That said, I certainly never said that Trump could lift sanctions in return for anything or ever mentioned in the context of any deal at all."

BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAYS IN HIS INTERVIEWS, IS IT? 

What a guilty little dumbshit.  </TEXT>

Interesting - what is in fact the lowest populated congressional district? How did it split it's R/D vote in 2016 and how many D's would have to move there to flip it?

Anyone up for doing that math?

	<TEXT> But one would presume that the no-fly zone was put in place by people who would know *why* it was put in place. And they should be pissed/scared to death if those orders were no enforced.

There are a couple of ways around this, I guess.

1) Martians unaware of the prototype soldiers and the dangers they pose put the no-fly zone in place because of the "battle" and those who do know why were just like "Yeah, we can roll with that".

2) It was in fact put in place by people (person) in the know, but that person (Martian killed by Errinwright) is dead so, no-one knew how serious it was as a precaution. 

That thing though is going to run to her father and cry next time though. I'm convinced. They should ship her to venus to be a family with the other two. </TEXT>
