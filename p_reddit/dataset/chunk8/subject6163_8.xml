	<TEXT> After owning the AIO by Joytech for about a week now, I deicded to give a quick review/rant about the device.

As for its size, and durability it's good, having dropped it on concrete and no more than a scratch on the paint. I'd say it's built tough.

Sadly that is about all the Good I can say about it. The coils last maybe a week, and after trying the second coil in the box, it burned right away even after I primed it. So, not sure if I would recommend this device to anyone after my usage.

I mean yes for $30 (cad) I got what I payed for, but for a coil to last a week, and the other one to last 10 minutes, that's just bad design.

In total I give it a 4/10 </TEXT>

Few hours later, (maybe one) the kids mother rang my house and told my parents what I had done. I got grounded for the night I think.

Still dislike the kid.

	<TEXT> Oddly enough I just had surgery three weeks ago to remove pencil lead form my foot to remove the lead some ass-hole got there.

See, i was told to run through the field at recess in middle school and I didn't see the pencils, and got one through my shoe, and into my foot, fuck it hurt.
After 10 years I got it out, and my God is it liberating, I can walk again :) </TEXT>
