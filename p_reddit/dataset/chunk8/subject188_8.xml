	<TEXT> We met during my sophomore year and during her first semester of freshman year. I switched into a class late and sat next to her. I asked her if we could use computers in the class. Her, being a terrified freshman, nervously replied how she had no clue and we talked a bit.

 The next class (five days later) I was doing homework on my laptop outside of class before it started and was really concentrating. Apparently concentrating too hard, however, because she sat next to me for 10 minutes with me ignoring her, haha. 10+ minutes later, I turned and very smoothly said: "Oh, hi!". From their we became friends; a few months later, a couple. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has results. Because I've never taken anything else, I can't really compare it, but I do notice a difference. It clears my head a bit and allows me to rationalize situations much better. I also avoid most of the suicidal thoughts that had plagued me previously. 

It really is an amazing albeit unpredictable drug. It's used for a bunch of different conditions, including depression, and seems to help a lot of people. It's often times added onto an SSRI prescription for additional benefits. It's helped my anxiety a lot as well which is another thing it is used to treat.

Can you tell me a bit about your experience with prozac if you don't mind me asking? </TEXT>
