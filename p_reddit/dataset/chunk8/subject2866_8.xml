	<TEXT> No person needs to justify why/why not they choose what type of family they have, but I'll give you an answer for why I chose to have kids.

I am an awesome person, and my husband is also totally terrific. Together, our combined genetics would make super people, so we decided to procreate. We had two beautiful boys, who are pretty great people. While I had not the best childhood, which has contributed to my mental illness, my husband and I can do better in giving our children a good, loving, and stable childhood environment.

Of course my children deserve better, they deserve the best. That is why I'm giving them all the tools I've learned, to help them navigate through their emotions, and to help them learn to adapt to their fullest capabilities. </TEXT>
