	<TEXT> The sentence is "Is qu Vi Latn venit per portam Capnam Rmam intrat." I believe I know all of the technical things happening in this sentence, I just cannot translate it into English for the life of me.

"Via Latina" is obviously an ablative, "Per portam Capenam" is an accusative of movement, and "Romam" is the locative.

When I try to translate it, I get "He who comes by Via Latina through Porta Capena enters Rome." I've tried every combination, but none makes sense. What am I doing wrong? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After birth, all Ashara could think about was sleeping, and how good it would be to take a nap right now. She felt a little guilty for wanting to go to sleep, after all, she just brought her first child into the world. But there's one thing no one ever tells you about birthing a child: how exhausting it is. She looked down at the baby lying in her arms, he was wrapped in a blanket, sleeping. He looked so peaceful when he slept, and truth be told, she was a bit jealous that he got to sleep.

"Would you like to hold him?" Ashara asked, half asleep. </TEXT>

"Pardon, Prince Lucky," he bowed his head. "She can do everything. She has to be the best leopard I've ever had the pleasure of training." </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Event] The Feast at Spottswood </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After a *long* day of watching the joust, the melee, and the archery competition, he just wanted to eat, so he made his toast quick.

"Lords and Ladies of Westeros, thank you for coming to Spottswood!" he yelled, raising his glass. 

Unlike him the toast was quick, and somewhat impersonal, as he was quite tired, he didn't care much, but inside he did feel a bit guilty.

[M] Not much, have to go to work. In case you missed in the winners were: Ser Tommard Rosby in the josut, Lady Cassena Storm in the melee, and Bearn Cafferen in archery.

Open rp to all who attended the event, go wild in the comments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ran across this sentence in Lingua Latina "Mdus vi Latn Tscul Rmam ambulat." This might seem like a simple sentence and a silly question, but I don't want to get anything wrong. I think it means "Medus walks Via Latina from Tusculum to Rome." Also, why isn't Via Latina in the accusative? Isn't the object of this sentence?

EDIT: Reading farther, I've found that it happens a lot. It's not hard or scary, I'm just wondering if this could be anything else or am I right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He hadn't been back to Spottswood since before they left for the King's Wedding and Jaehaerys didn't want to go back, then he'd have to see that traitor. *I can't believe he flirted with that Storm bitch. If he wants to be a Stormlander so bad, he should just move there, he'd fit right in.* As he pulled up to Spottswood, the once loving place where he learned to be a man, where he learned to fight, and where he had learned about love, became nothing but a reminder of Rhaego's betrayal, all he could think about was that Storm bitch, and it made him sick to his stomach. *Even swine are better than a Stormlander.*

Two guards were standing outside. One was a portly old man, the other a lanky dark haired boy no older than 19. The sky was a mixture of Martell red and orange and Baratheon yellow, the latter made him only think of that Dondarrion bastard, which made him even sicker. *How the hell could a Dornishman flirt with a Stormlander, disgusting.* The air smelled of salt, and the sound of waves crashing the shore filled the air. 

"My lord, do you need help off your horse?" the portly guard asked.

"No, I'm fine," Jaehaerys slurred. "Where is Rhaego?"

"He's in his room, my lord," the lanky guard said.

Jaehaerys ran pased the guards, knocking the portly one over. _That son of bitch thinks he's gotten rid of me, ha._ He ran a to Rhaego's room as fast as he could, thinking about how much he'll beat the shit out of him, his sword was itching to get out of its scabbard. _I won't kill him, a couple of clouts to the head should do the boy good, after all, killing him would be kinslaying._ When he finally got to Rhaego's door, he was completely high off of adrenaline not to mention the juice he'd been drinking all night. His lip trembled with anticipation, the hand on the hilt even more so.

"Rhaego!" Jaehaerys screamed, busting down the door.

"Jae?" Rhaego said, lifting his head up from his book.

[m] If anyone actually reads this, I'll try to post part 2 tomorrow. Felt this was getting a bit long.

	<TEXT> ***7th Month, 315 Selwyn***

He had been in the Dornish desert for five months already, oh how the time flew by! It had almost been half a year since he'd seen his family, but it had seemed only yesterday when he left Spottswood. He knew that couldn't be true, do to the fact that he was changing so much. He had always been a bit of a late bloomer, and he knew that but squiring for Ser Gerold had changed everything. Just in the last five months, he'd grown five inches! His hair had grown down to his shoulders and he had gained at least fifteen pounds of muscle. He had also started to grown some hair on his face, though it was still not much. He couldn't believe how much he'd changed. He also got better with a sword as him and Gerold were sparring almost every other night. If they weren't sparring, they were climbing the mountains (which made his huge hands almost as rough as the mountains themselves), or learning how to fight hand to hand. Selwyn swore he'd never let this trip change him, but it did. He never admitted to himself but it did, at least a little. He wasn't nearly as battle hungry as his father, but he did come to enjoy fighting with a sword and hand to hand, even got a bit good at it to be honest. Through all of that though, the old Selwyn was never lost. He still was soft and compassionate, a lover of books, the black sheep of the family. He had even learned some things that weren't combat related. 

In the back of his mind, he wondered what he'd be like in another six months and it both excited him, and scared him.

	<TEXT> Rhaego scanned the hall, his half Valyrian blonde, half black hair swaying in the wind, and say the beautiful Cassena Storm and she was indeed beautiful. *She did quite well in the joust and melee today, maybe this could be my excuse to talk to her.* Admittedly, he remember she was a Stormlander, which didn't bother him, as much as it would bother his cousin Jaehaerys, who he'd always been somewhat close to, even though Jaehaerys wasn't very pleasant to be around. *Fuck Jae, she did well today and I'm going to go tell her.* He grabbed his goblet on the table, took a swig of wine, and walked towards Cassena.

"My lady," he bowed. "If I may say, you did quite well today."

"My prince, I believe my daughter promised you a leopard at the Tully wedding a while back, a thousand apologies you haven't received it yet," he bowed. "I've just been so busy going to my children's weddings."

Then he had an idea, it could be a win win for everyone.

"Prince Lucky, would you be interested in coming to Spottswood on the first month of this up coming year? We're holding a festival for the realm and whilst there you could also get your leopard." </TEXT>

It has to be the seventh time I've read it," he said, running his hand across the cracked spine. "Both great books.

	<TEXT> Quentyn could see the lad was nervous, but he didn't say anything for that would've been rude. He had been surprised someone had came up to him at all, no one else had. Not in the three years he had been here had anyone else intuited conversation with him. Did they think him strange or rude? He shrugged off the thought and decided to make a new friend, surely he needed one, everyone needs at least one. 

He closed the old book he was reading, _The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling by Grand Maester Munkun_, and he looked at the boy intently. He had light brown hair which was a bit darker than his own and eyes as brown as fertile soil; he could only be a Reachman.

"Hi, I'm Quentyn Santagar," he smiled, holding out his big hand. "I see you and I are the only ones left in the library, more books for us." </TEXT>
