	<TEXT> I'm using 70/30 juice with 6mg of nicotine and every time I put in a new coil, it doesn't take long before it starts acting as though the coil is flooded (a couple days at most), but I don't know how the coil would be flooded. I get hardly any, if any, pull from it and it starts gargling and popping hot juice into my mouth. The only way it stops is if I change the coil. But like I said, each time I change the coil it starts doing the same thing shortly thereafter. I've been going through coils like crazy. Am I doing something wrong? Is there a way I can fix this problem? Any advice is much appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may have burned up the coil with the first dry hit so now it's not working properly. Have you tried putting a new coil in and seeing if the problem persists? I had a terrible dry hit with my T22 a little while back, and then the coil wouldn't do anything at all. I was getting no vapor whatsoever. Nothing was happening when I would hold down the button. But with a new coil, everything was back to normal. I'd try a new coil and see if that fixes it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah I see. That makes sense. I bet it is fun. I've always just found some of the ways we speak rather odd. Like in that case, there's no reason to not make it a contraction, and it seems like it'd be easier, so why wouldn't we? In the case of the German girl, she was just doing what she had learned. And it's not incorrect in any way. Only someone that grew up speaking English in an English speaking country would know that it's not typically said or written like that. So I've always just been curious about it. Maybe it's just cultural things. I don't know. Weird stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Surprisingly, no. I was just curious because of the "unless you've a really really hot oven." I knew this German girl who learned English in school, and her English was really, really good, she just did a couple quirky things when she would talk or write. And one of them was that she would turn anything and everything that she possibly could into a contraction. Maybe they talk or write differently in Britain. It's not wrong by any means; you didn't type anything incorrectly or anything, it's just really interesting to me. Here in the U.S., for whatever reason, we wouldn't turn that into a contraction. We would just say "unless you have a really really hot oven." I don't know why that is, it seems easier the other way. That's it. I just think it's interesting and was curious. </TEXT>

Although, like has been mentioned, you need a VERY small amount of chlorine to sanitize things, so the water contains very very little chlorine. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Adderall XR Not Lasting Long Enough </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-01 02:50:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I take 30 mg of Adderall XR once a day. I know XR is supposed to last 10-12 hours, but I have a high metabolism, and medicine never lasts me as long as it says it's supposed to. So my XR lasts me about 8 hours. So it really only lasts me a shift at work. And so I don't typically have my medicine for anything other than work. So I can't seem to get much else done. On my days off, I have school. And my classes are pretty far apart. So if I take it in time for my first class, it's already wearing off by my last class. So I typically don't have my medicine for my first class. I know that Adderall XR doesn't go any higher than 30mg and that a common thing for psychiatrists to do is also prescribe IR to be taken after the XR wears off. However I don't know how I feel about taking IR along with my XR. Does anybody have any experience taking both throughout the day? Was it beneficial to you? How did it work? Also, is there any other options I could possibly bring up and discuss with my doctor at my next appointment in a couple weeks? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do the exact same thing. Also to the point that my fingers hurt pretty bad and to the point of bleeding. I pick at my nails and the skin underneath with anything I can find, even a box cutter since I use one at work. No matter how many times my fingers ache terribly and bleed, I just keep doing it. However, I never realized this was something that people with ADHD do. Although I have noticed I don't really do it on my meds, until it wears off. And then I go to town. That's interesting, but to address your question, what are you afraid of your doctor doing if you tell him about it? And honestly, I don't know why you wouldn't want to stop, I defintely would. My fingers are in absolutely atrocious condition. And the bleeding and pain is not fun. I've never brought it up with my doctor because I didn't realize it was an ADHD thing, but I'm not sure what he would do about it anyways. And if you don't want to stop, for whatever reason, it's not going to kill you or harm anyone else, so I'd say just leave it alone and keep doing what your doing, if that's what you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was researching it, because I wanted to know what the chances are that my kid(s) will have ADHD. And I believe, someone correct me if I'm wrong, there is a significant genetic component to ADHD. Often times someone with ADHD will have a parent (or a close relative) with ADHD. Obviously that's not the only thing that plays a part, and oddly enough, neither of my parents have ADHD, nor do any of my close relatives. So it's not the only thing. I believe I saw that if you have ADHD, there is about a 20-30% chance that your child will also have ADHD. So it's still more likely that they don't, but their chance of having it is significantly more than normal. If you AND your significant other have ADHD, then the chance of your kid having it goes up to over 50%. (About 54% I believe). So there is defintely a lot more to ADHD than just a genetic component. But there is a significant genetic component involved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately I don't agree with most of these. 

Players should be able to choose which way they bat. Not everybody can hit from both sides. So if you can, it's actually kind of impressive. And it can give you an advantage. If you can hit from the other side of the plate, and you want to, by all means, do it. Also, if you are better at hitting from the left (or right for that matter), do it. Hit from whatever side you feel most comfortable.

Hats. I don't really care either way. Everybody wears them so it's not like an unfair advantage or something. It's like sunglasses. Personally, I think sunglasses would make it harder for me to see and catch the ball. But some players wear them. If they want to wear them, then wear them. I don't see a problem. It's not a big deal.

Salaries. I partially agree with this. I don't like how the Angels or Yankees or Dodgers are good because they can just buy whatever player they want to, but the Rays have to trade away any player that becomes good because they can't afford them. However, salary is a part of the game, and it always will be, and I'm not really sure how you fix this problem.

Intentional walks should absolutely be banned from the game. They're a cheap way out. It's similar to intentional grounding in football, which isn't allowed. Just because a player is better than you and you can't beat them, doesn't mean you should be able to just bypass them. Either it needs to be banned or the consequence of an intentional walk needs to be more devastating.

Base stealing. Speed and base running is a skill. As well as catchers throwing out potential base stealers and pitchers holding them close to the bag. Faster players should absolutely have an advantage over slower players. If you have the ability to steal bases, do it. It's a skill that's part of the game. That'd be like saying swinging and missing at balls shouldn't be a strike because why should people that have a good eye for the strike zone and have good plate discipline have an advantage over those who don't. It's not like someone who is fast is automatically awarded second base. It's a baseball skill and they should absolutely 100% should have an advantage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There would have to be more to it for sure. But for example, including runs scored by the pitcher in the game and games where 0 runs were driven in by the pitcher, but he didn't allow any runs either (but only if the pitcher got a hit), Adam Wainwright in 2014 would have had a Wins Created (or something like that) of 5. 

Maybe I'm going down the completely wrong path here. But I think a stat sort of similar, taking things like that into account, would be cool to have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I think changing the ERA wouldn't work, but having a seperate Stat that is something like ratio of runs given up to runs driven in would defintely be an interesting stat to have. Maybe you do it like on a game by game basis. Like this pitcher gave up one run in this game but drove in two could be more beneficial to a team than a pitcher that gives up 7 runs in a game and drives in 4, and gives up 2 runs in a different game and drives in 1. If that makes sense. Maybe like how many wins he created for his team based on how many runs driven in versus how many runs he gave up. I don't know if that makes any sense. 

Totally unrelated side note: Should a run that scores on an error made by the pitcher count as an earned run towards his ERA? </TEXT>
