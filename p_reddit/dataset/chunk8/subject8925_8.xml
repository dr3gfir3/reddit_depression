	<TEXT> I mean chaotic good like the Dungeons   Dragons alignment. :]

I generally distrust strangers (hence the throwaway account). I'm out as crazy to most of my friends, but not very many of them know, for example, that I'm suicidal right now. I've lost friends who I cared for very much over my own mental illnesses, I try to not tell people unless I really have to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ignore the hallucinations as much as I can. I've been seeing bugs, creepy crawly things all night, but I'm refraining from reacting to them. Reacting to the hallucinations make them more real, somehow. I have rituals that I need to complete, like scrubbing myself a certain way in my daily shower, brushing my teeth 32 times on each surface. I have to start walking on my right foot and end my travel in an odd number. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of my issues are interlocked. If I start having more anxiety, my OCD gets more intense. If my OCD gets more intense, I get more depressed. It's very cyclical. </TEXT>
