	<TEXT> My experience of chickens is in shrink wrap in the meat department. How should I know what they are like on the farm?  It's just a figure of speech I had never thought about before.  And many figures of speech are not literal - raining cats and dogs, running like crazy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Further complicating the "freedom" of cage-free and free-range enclosures, hens will peck one another in an effort to establish a dominance order.... In flocks of 100,000 or more chickens, the least dominant birds can be subjected to so much pecking from other hens that their welfare is clearly worse than it would be in an enriched cage. ... Egg producers limit the damage that birds can do to each other by trimming off the sharp tip of their beak (which is also controversial). Even still, higher mortality from pecking gets treated as a cost of business in cage-free production facilities.
