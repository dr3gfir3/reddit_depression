	<TEXT> To play devils advocate a little, there is often times a disconnect between self perceived performance and actual employee performance. I do agree though there's many employers who want to keep compensation secret to keep wages down. I don't believe this is the case with my company, but it is with many. (I work in HR).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ordered my Finland from NHL Shop on 8/23 and never received shipping information. I presume because it ships from the manufacturer. I just received it yesterday 9/9. I actually tweeted at NHL Shops twitter with my order number Wednesday last week and they responded back and told me it would be delivered Friday, which it was. I would suggest giving that a try. They never replied to my website inquiry.  </TEXT>
