	<TITLE> [CofD / H:tV] Question on the use of the reason system as described in Mirrors. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So, for those who haven't read it, the book Mirrors talks about a "reason" stat that starts at ten and is reduced when "he accepts a new reality of thinking that goes against reasonable thought or modes of action" until he reaches 0 and is reduced to insanity and is unplayable.

So my question is: would you have a player lose sanity if they were to use a supernatural creature's weakness against it? e.g. using silver vs. werewolves, a stake through the heart for a vampire. Or what if they were to destroy a ghost's anchor? It seems that in order to fight these supernatural beings they'd have to sacrifice sanity.

That makes sense to me, but what if the game changes from Humans to Hunters? Do Hunters have the same risk of insanity? Everything that they deal with would cause them to lose sanity, even their own endowments because they require the acceptance of a reality different than our own. Is that just the risk they take? Is it just thematically appropriate that they will eventually go mad the more they learn? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The beetle begins its life very small and, when introduced to a host, burrows toward its heart. Once it has reached the heart, its body begins to fuse with the heart's tissue as it releases a paralytic toxin. The beetle's growth is then exponentially increased as its body grows to eventually replace the heart, devouring all the tissue that was once there. As it grows, its "legs" expand through the host's arteries and veins, extending through limbs essentially forming a second skeleton.

Once the beetle has grown to its full size and taken control of the host, it stops producing its toxin and uses the body to incubate its eggs. The eggs are produced into the esophagus and they move to the host's stomach. The beetle continually produces these eggs until the host is swollen with them. When the eggs hatch the stomach of the host ruptures, releasing hundreds of tiny beetles, free to find a new host.

As for new uses:

Possibly use the growth hormone to increase growth of host.

Or engineer a subspecies of beetle that instead grows a different part, like its wings or carapace, allowing for flying or armored ~~zombies~~ test subjects.

Engineer mutualistic symbiotic subspecies that attaches to outside of host and creates exoskeleton, giving bonus strength/armor.

Take samples of the paralytic toxin for extremely effective paralyzing poison. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd enjoy Talos Principle, I think.

Thanks, OP! </TEXT>
