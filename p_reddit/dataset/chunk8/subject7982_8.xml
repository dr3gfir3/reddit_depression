At a time when long-range cheap flights are dominant, I can see this failing in the future just like the Concorde, or at a minimum only fit on a few flight paths, like LA-NY or NY-London </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah absolutely. It's definitely a balancing act. There's also the issue of people just not liking increased foot traffic and cars in their neighborhoods, which I think is a valid complaint if not taken care of correctly.

Overall I think that Kendall Yards are better than the Perry District in terms of helping the city. If it ends up failing it won't "doom" a bunch of people. Generally the people living there are well-off enough that they can respond to issues like that. It also allows for solutions to traffic issues by designing to projected traffic levels from the start, not retrofitting an already developed area.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I think the gentrification of the Perry area is a bit different than the Kendall Yards project. The issue people have with gentrification is that it moves into what is already a low-income neighborhood, then revitalizes it. One issue is that the revitalization can make the cost of living in that neighborhood too high for the people that previously lived there.

Kendall Yards is different because there was no real neighborhood there before, it was crap land. Theoretically they could run into an issue where the surrounding neighborhoods have their cost of living go up. But for the most part the higher cost will be in Kendall Yards by itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Frank:** You enter the cavern that the quest-giver Joel sent you to, taking a second to re-orientate yourself to the darkness. On your right you see a wall covered in what looks to be portraits of Gods, some sort of memorial to those long gone. On your left you see a coffee machine and a small kitchen. 

**Orma:** Do I see anything out of the ordinary?

**Frank:** Roll for a perception check

**Orma:** 17

**Frank:** As you look around the room, you hear small footsteps hidden in the shadows. As you investigate further, one of the small creatures runs past your foot, and you manage to grab him by the scruff of his neck. 

**Frank:** While picking him up, you all notice that he looks like a gnome, similar to the ones you have back home. He has large feet for his size, and short brown curly hair covering his body. As you hold him he starts to yell and try to slip out of your grip.

**Creature (high pitch/squeaky voice):** ^(Hey put me down! Knock it off!)

**Orma:** I'm going to try to talk to it and calm it down. 

**Bor Ealis:** Who cares, just kill it so we can move on!

**Frank:** When the cretaue hears this he starts to struggle even more in Orma's hands.

\*Orma ingnores Bor\*

**Orma:** Hey Little guy! Don't worry, I won't let that mean man hurt you. What's your name?

**Frank:** He finally stops struggling and looks up at you. You notice some hair is discolored around his eyes, seemingly forming the shape of rectangular glasses.

**Creature:** ^(Well... My name is Burnsy Musk and I'm a cave gnome! Can you let me go now?)

**Frank:** As you talk to this gnome, you notice that slowly more gnomes are coming out of the shadows. They all start to gather around Orma at her feet.

**Orma:** I'll let you out if you answer some of my questions first! We're supposed to be looking for a really really bad guy in this cave. Have you seen him?

**Burnsy:** ^(Oh you must be talking about Pongus!)

**Frank:** As Burnsy says the name Pongus you notice that all the gnomes on the ground suddenly respond. Some gasp, other cover their eyes, and one of the larger gnomes with a big beard and nose ring take up a defensive position with his small spear.

**Orma:** Can you tell us more? What is he like? How does he fight?

**Burnsy:** ^(Well he's ugly, big and purple! He's got soft wool skin, so maybe use fire. He has a big horn that he likes to try stabbing people with, and when in danger he can fly for short periods of time!)

**Orma:** Do you know if there's an easy way to kill him?

**Burnsy:** ^(Well he's missing an eye, so if you aim for his other eye you can make him blind! But watch out, because if you get to close he can stick out his tongue and catch you so he can eat you!)

**Frank:** At this point some of the younger gnomes scream and run back into the shadows.

**Orma:** Alright guys, looks like we have our next battle. A one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater! Let's get to work!

**Burnsy:** ^(What does that mean??)

	<TEXT> So I disagree with the premise as a whole. While RT undoubtedly has a very large under-18 fanbase, at it's core they shouldn't be "teaching" these fans about life. They will definitely influence these younger fans, but if these younger fans are getting all of their "life knowledge" from RT then they might have bigger problems down the line.

It's kind of like the argument against the Simpsons when it first came out, or South Park, or GTA. People liked to point at these and say "Aha! That's the cause of all these issues in these kids!" While in reality, these shows and games are only a small part, and the actual majority of a kid's upbringing is on the parents and those around them.

So really, it comes down to how a kid is raised more-so than anything else. If a kid has two alcoholic parents, you can probably make a good guess how it ends up. Not 100%, but most of the time that's pretty bad for the kid. 

However, aside from this, you may have a small point with the drinking, especially in terms of binge drinking. They do have a lot of fans that are late high school/early college age, and this is where it gets dicey. They should know RT isn't a "monkey-see monkey-do" kind of company, but I'm sure some forget that. This could potentially lead to some of them going to a party/gathering, and thinking they can chug half a fifth like Geoff can, or take swigs of Vodka like Gus. RT is under no obligation to correct this, and they shouldn't be. 

But at the same time, maybe they could just make a bit of a joke out of this. If Michael is slamming Riot Punch they could have a warning at the bottom: "WARNING: Michael is a professional drinker. Please do not try at home." Or maybe have Michael actually attempt to slur that out when wasted. Like I said, it's not needed but it does address the issue is a slightly funny way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love this Roosterteeth Store Gus takeover, and would love to see them do other cool stuff with the store. If you ever have been on Woot.com, you might have seen a Woot-Off. I think it would be awesome to see the Roosterteeth Store do something like that. 

If you haven't been on Woot, it's pretty simple. The store would pick a day to do the Sales, then through-out the day they would pick certain items to be part of it. They would put up one item for sale with a good discount and only a certain number available. Once that item sells out they put up a new item and start again.

If they really wanted to mix it up and create interest, they could spice up the offerings. Maybe in between two regular sales they could do special flash sales. One item with a very small quantity for like 90% off. Or 100 random signed items for $5 each. You would obviously need to put in limits, but otherwise would work well I think.

The benefits of doing something like this are good for both the customer and the RT store. The customer might get the chance to buy something they were waiting for a price drop for, and also get a chance at something really cool for really cheap.

Alternatively, the RT store gets the benefit of having people "camp" the website, and also can clear out old inventory if needed. They could even sweeten the pot other ways to get people to buy more stuff. Like Woot will do $5 all-day shipping, anything you buy on site that day is covered. 

I just think it might be a good idea, because I know I sure would be paying attention to the site like a hawk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah this article is nice with how it talks about Gonzaga, but the rest contains a whole lot of bullshit. I mean, first, lets look at a single paragraph:

For a while, that success was nowhere to be found, especially not in sports. The city has long had a minor league baseball team (the Spokane Indians) and a hockey team of the same level (the Spokane Chiefs). There was an arena football team for a few years (the Spokane Shock), but that disappeared when not enough people showed up to games. None of these teams were much to be proud of (and most of them were rather racist in name).

Yeah so a good chunk of this paragraph is wrong. Let's look closer.

In the last 30 years, the Indians have made the Playoffs 9 times, and of those 9 times won the championship 8 times.

and a hockey team of the same level (the Spokane Chiefs).

Out of the 60 teams in the Canadian Hockey League, the chiefs consistently ranks in the top 10 for attendance. They won their championship, the Memorial Cup, in 1991 and 2008. They were the first American team to win the Memorial Cup on Canadian Soil.

There was an arena football team for a few years (the Spokane Shock), but that disappeared when not enough people showed up to games. 

Okay so here is where it gets even more bullshit. First, the Spokane Shock were overall pretty damn successful. In their four years in the AF2, they won two championships, in their inaugural year and the final year of the AF2. They then moved to the AFL for six years, making the playoffs in five of those years and winning the championship in one. Three championships in ten years of operation is not a bad team.

Furthermore, the attendance part couldn't be further from the truth. They led the AF2 in attendance for all four years, and were top ten in the AFL for attendance for all six years. The AFL mostly folded because other teams were having attendance issues, not the Shock. 

None of these teams were much to be proud of (and most of them were rather racist in name).

I'm absolutely proud of our teams, and I'm not touching that last statement with a ten foot pole.

I'll keep digging through the article, but there's so much wrong with this that it's incredible. Hell, just with a quick glance I found this:

In 2004, Spokane taxpayers were happy to help pour $25m into the McCarthey Athletic Center, which seats 6,000 screaming fans. But the new arena hasnt had significant effect on the towns struggling economy as a whole.

Yeah not even close to true. Here is what the Gonzaga Bulletin says:

Construction of the McCarthey Athletic Center was funded through varied sources including private contributions to Gonzaga's Capital Campaign, corporate sponsorships, business agreements and the men's basketball ticket sales, according to the summer 2003 issue of Gonzaga Quarterly.

So yeah, overall, this guy has no idea what he is talking about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would almost call it a "speculation" bridge. The neighborhood where it will land right now isn't the best. That's why some in the City Council nicknamed it the "Bridge to Hookerville." However the speculation part comes from the fact that the land around where the bridge lands, due to the issues, is pretty dang cheap. 

The goal of the bridge is to get developers to buy the land on the South Side of the bridge near Sprague, and essentially turn the neighborhood around. Avista has already invested there, buying multiple lots both on Sprague and one block North. We could see more developers buying up land soon, especially to build apartments and dormitories for the University District. 

So really, it could end up being useful and smart, or it could fail and we wasted a bunch of money. At this point it could really go either way, although with Avista's acquisition of a bunch of property I would lean towards useful as of now.  </TEXT>

**If Achievement City were a real city, what would the citizens think of the main group?**

---

My name is John, and I live in the forests of Norther Nor North Havermeyer, Achievement City. I keep to myself for the most part. The place I call home is a small dugout on a hillside, barely noticeable unless you are actually looking for it.

Achievement City is a larger "city", if you can even call it that. A group of adventurers seem to run the city from Downtown, acting like they own the place. The income disparity is incredible. I've even heard one of their members has a massive mansion, yet it's completely empty. 

It's hard to get by out here in Havermeyer. I tried to ranch one time, getting myself some cows and pigs. But the next day, all were slaughtered, except one cow. I thought they may have had some mercy on me, leaving me something to survive with. But at some point a strange man from the group came and stole my last cow, muttering about holes and a man named Edgar. 

I occasionally try to observe the main group, just to learn what they do and how they operate. I learnt pretty quick that it's best to stay at a distance. They have no regard for safety, diplomacy, or tact. At one point I even seen them playing with Creepers!

To an extent, they seem to be religious, or at least idolatrous. Some follow the same religion I do, praising Dan the Man (Greatness be upon him). Other seems to follow a very large man named Jack, who will bless those he deems worthy with his Holy Water stick.

At the core, their main focus is usually Gold. They collect, compile, and covet gold, taking all they can find. At this point they've created an entire economy based on Gold, trading around towers of  it without an extra thought. 

A couple of different times I thought I had found Gold, perhaps enough to get me out of this tiny hole I live in. The one time it was actually a bunch of dyed wool on a dirt block. The other was on a pedestal surrounded by lava. They take pleasure in deceiving people like me. 

Do I like living in Achievement City? That's tough to answer. When the main group isn't there, it's tolerable. Nice land, beautiful scenery, and enough landmarks and monuments to last a lifetime (even a brand new Museum under downtown!). 

But when the group is there, it's hell. Their tyrannical nature is matched only by their chaotic actions. I've had the entrance to my house covered in lava. I've had to run as fast as I could from massive TNT explosions. I once suited up in all my armor to fight a creeper that I later realized was just a member of their group.

It's hell here. And yet, I wouldn't have it any other way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a huge amount of semi trucks that need to go from I-90 up North and vice-versa. As of right now they have two main routes. The first isn't awful, but also isn't ideal. That would be the route that takes them up Argonne and through Bigelow Gulch to where the NSC currently begins. 

The bigger problem is that a very large amount of trucks currently use Division St as a go-between I-90 and North. Because Division has so many traffic lights, these trucks are constantly idling in the middle of the city, and causing traffic problems overall.

I personally can't wait for it to get done. Let me know if you have any questions! </TEXT>

They will install radio jammers, ensuring that the only station you can receive in your car is an AM foreign language station.

The will install a mosquito noise generator in your passenger head-rest, leading to the eventual break-up between you and your girlfriend.

And once all of this is done, they wait. A few days, a few weeks, who knows? Your temper shortens, you show up later and later to work. Your boss is forced to let you go. And this is when they make their final move.

We are looking for a talented creative producer to join our team for a new short form comedy variety series. This daily series will live on the front page of Fullscreen's new video ap and provide social content for it's various other platforms. The ideal candidate will proven success in running digital shoots, strong writing skills, and thrive in a collaborative environment.

And one of the requirements:

Write/direct multiple videos throughout the week

So it makes me wonder what daily, funny show it could be. Maybe this is what The Patch is being retooled into? Or something new?

	<TEXT> As an aside, I looked at the property owners in the area on maps.spokanecity.org. Avista now owns both North corner lots at Sprague and Sheridan, and the large back lot at Riverside and Sheridan. Plus a couple smaller lots

In addition to Avista, the City of Spokane owns the land North of Riverside from Grant to Sheridan that butts up against the railroad tracks, so they will probably be able sale that land without any issues as well.

The only issue I may see them having is the private owners in the area. A couple of lots South of Riverside but North of Sprague are privately owned, so if they aren't willing to sale there may be a combo of new modern buildings and old run-down ones.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I'm still kind of leery about spending the money on a 120ft high pedestrian bridge, I'll be all for it if businesses and corporations continue to redevelop this area of the city. It's long overdue.

I would imagine other companies may start signing on quick, especially while property prices in that area are still low. Due to our sprawl, Spokane doesn't usually have a chance at "urban renewal", so this is a nice difference.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it's all about how you frame it. Sure our O-Line sucked, but look at it a different way. If our O-Line's performance and spending are both 32nd in the league, that really sucks. But if we spend 50% of what the 31st team spends, and our O-Line is 75% as good as the 31st team, well then Cable is outperforming other coaches! He's doing great! </TEXT>

Or Flip this house. To be honest, Michael's house is kind of boring compared to the rest (excluding his and Gavin's bunker). Geoff's is big, Ryan's is deep, Jack's is self-centered, Jeremy's is modern, Gavin's is... well Gavin's. 

But they could definitely work on Michael's house. Hell, it needs a nursery now at a minimum! </TEXT>

Gavin is a spineless coward of a man with his cock/nose/both firmly lodged up Geoff's anus, which is why he perpetuates the institutionalized bullying of Ray by people who are clearly jealous of his looks, youth, wit, charm and talent at video games.

dude u guys realize that michael sucks up just as much in the lps that if you go back to 6 or 8, somewhere back then he sucked up just as much. </TEXT>
