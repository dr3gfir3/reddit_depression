	<TEXT> This is a really insightful paper, with lessons for other grid-style utilities.

A study of the electricity, gas and water industries undertaken by the Australia Institute found that the number of technical and trades workers employed in these industries had grown by less than the workforce as a whole between 1997 and 2012 (28 per cent as opposed to 37 per cent). 

By contrast, the number of managers had more than doubled, HR and marketing professionals had more than tripled, and the number of sales workers had risen by 500 per cent. At the beginning of the period, technicians outnumbered managerial and retail staff. By the end, the reverse was
true.

Basically, despite the claims of efficiency,  privatisation meant that maintainers were replaced by salespeople. 

The physical network is a natural monopoly which means the market is best served by a single set of wires or pipes. In the absence of regulation, a monopolist will charge prices that are too high, with the result that they will not perform their signalling functions properly. Consumers will get less than they should at a higher price, profits will be excessive and investment will be distorted. 

These problems can be reduced, though not eliminated completely, by comprehensive price regulation. But when privatised firms are regulated in this way, their primary incentive is to game the system to secure higher returns.

This is fundamental to the problem. The only way to prevent profiteering from a natural monopoly is price regulation, but once you establish price regulation, the monopolist's goal is to reduce investment in maintenance and upgrades. This is why NBN fails, why AEMO fails, why private health insurance fails, why all of the planned privatisations will also fail.

This article should be nailed to Turnbull's forehead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Economics can tell you a risk exists, and if there is a correction it will likely be intense and widespread

Economics can also tell you how to slow and reduce the impact of the risk.

Whichever government is in power at the time can do a lot to offset the damaging social effects, or to deflate prices without killing the whole market. 


Keeping the market fluid is crucial. The worst hardships and social damage happen when homeowners can't downsize because the value of their properties is falling faster then they can pay off their mortgages.


Government initiatives like subsidising genuinely affordable housing, and having enough low cost homes available, would give people with mortgages in negative equity places to move to. 

Government can prioritise infrastructure works in outlying regions to develop work opportunities out of major cities, and provide incentives for business to do the same (and additional fees/taxes for those who don't). 

They can establish tenant friendly laws to make renting more viable for long term city life. Etc,etc.


There's a huge set of tools to hand for a government with vision and purpose to ease what could be a crisis into a soft(er) landing. If they fail to use those tools, the people of Australia should punish them for their negligence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but that's missing the point.

Trumble's desperately focusing in on government debt at a time when everyone else is sounding increasing strident alarms about household debt.


The [OECD] warning puts renewed onus on the federal government to prepare for a potential shakeout caused by a house price crash.

The OECD notes that households now account for around half of Australia's total debt, which has soared well above 250 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with around a third of the total in 1995.

At the same time, the surge in property borrowing has pushed Australia towards the top of the OECD rankings for household debt and to around one-third more than the group's average. Furthermore, the rankings are based on figures dating back to 2015, thus missing the dramatic surge in debt-to-GDP of the past year or so.

Typically, revolutions happen to accelerate this process. Class wars are the situations that generally lead to revolutions, and the rapidly escalating wealth imbalance suggests we're in the process of losing one right now.


In Australia in the past we've had what have effectively been non-violent revolutions driven by citizen action and civil disobedience. Those mechanisms worked because governments of the time were not prepared for them, and did not have the surveillance and legal apparatus to detect and defuse them.

Times have changed, and surveillance of communications is close to absolute. Metadata collection means aggregate data can be used to identify community hotspots and shut them down. Regulatory capture and media control means messages of protest will be minimised and distorted before it can change the minds of the undecided population.Historically powerful things like general strikes, mas protests, occupations etc are illegal in any effective form, and to the extent they are permitted, already have control plans established against them.

What the authorities miss here is that those opportunities for peaceful change were safety valves for the discontented. Successive governments over the years have wired down the safeties.

For now, in the absence of an economic collapse, or other trigger, the pressure remains low. If there's a badly managed economic shock that leaves enough Australians in poverty or distressed, that will change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's interesting to see the sudden surge of spam posts now that the scale of their involvement in Reddit has been exposed. 

Astroturf advertising here is incredibly cheap per eyeball, but all of the revelations will either reduce their effectiveness or force Reddit to take action against them.

In December last year, I managed to place two entirely fake news stories onto influential subreddits - with millions of subscribers - and vote them to the top with fake accounts and fake upvotes for less than $200. It was simple, cheap and effective. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5vxxyh/reddit_is_being_regularly_manipulated_by_large/

The spammers know that, and are flooding as many adverts into the subreddits as tthey can before the hammer falls. It'll be interesting to see what emerges after the battle is done - attempting to monetorise inline advertising was what killed Slashdot and Digg. 

It may be a good time to start a new social media platform with built-in bayesian/machine learning protection...

Any good R coders reading?...

	<TEXT> The Cormack Foundation was set up to rely on investments to fund political donations in perpetuity. They currently fund both state and federal Liberal organisations, and are biggest annual donor to the Liberal party, but their **purpose** is to fund the administration and expenses of **whichever party** best enacts the goals of their administrators. Their administrators are largely drawn from mining, fossil fuel, mainstream media, banking, telecommunications and grocery corporations. 

They have existential control over the Liberal party's finances.

Last year, they funded the Liberal Democrats and Family First, likely as a warning shot to Turnbull, who had to top up the shortfall with his own money.

They also have direct access to LNP politicians at events like the Australian Davos Connection, and it's possible that there are incentives offered to individual politicians in private.

I didn't keep the links, and I'm not going to chase them up on a Friday evening...

Having said that, I remember Wang used the wind fatality data from the Caithness anti-windfarm group, which included:

Of the 170 fatalities:

103 were wind industry and direct support workers (divers, construction, maintenance, engineers, etc), or small turbine owner /operators.

69 were public fatalities, including workers not directly dependent on the wind industry (e.g.  transport workers).

17 bus passengers were killed in one single incident in Brazil in March 2012

4 members of the public were killed in an aircraft crash in May 2014 and a further three members of the public killed in a transport accident in September 2014.


The nuclear fatality data only included radiation-specific fatalities and excluded mining, construction, transport etc of nuclear fuel.

There was a study done by the Canadian nuclear regulator a year or two earlier showing that whole of lifecycle fatalities per unit of energy output was a little less than double that of gas.

Having said that, I'm not aware of ANY wind fatalities in Australia. Do you know of any, or have access to the statistics? 

I do know that there are uranium mining fatalities here every few years, and epidemiology suggesting elevated lung cancer in uranium miners.

Anyway, that should give you enough to Google around and draw your own conclusions. Just be careful with Reddit/Subreddits. There's a strong pattern of pro-nuclear deception here.

Problem is, it was based on Brian Wang's analysis in 2011, and is long obsolete given how much new wind and solar has been installed.

Even when it was written, some of the early criticisms were that it didn't account for lifecycle statistics, which meant that construction fatalities in new renewable industries weighted more heavily than those in nuclear generation, which has been running far longer, as well as unrelated accidents, such as road deaths, that were counted against renewable industries. Likewise fatalities incurred in very small scale remote area, marine, and industrial installs that aren't part of mainstream electricity production were counted against renewables.

TLDR: It's and old and busted news story. </TEXT>

There must be a vast silent majority of redditors just quietly lurking here in the hope of upvoting their favourite supermarket promotions and tactics.

Fascinating...

They show clearly that AEMO kept revising both their temperature and wind predictions to be more optimistic, despite evidence to the contrary. 

They also show that a 120MW Torrens Island gas generator failed due to a boiler leak, with 60MW more of Torrens Island generation lost because the gas generators couldn't cope with the heat. Lincoln 1 and Lincoln 3 gas generators had electronics fail causing the loss of 73MW of power. We already know the government decided not to start Pelican Point.


Meanwhile, wind generation gradually dropped 100MW below AEMO's poorly chosen expectations.

Both coal and oil are immensely valuable as raw materials for industries that don't just burn them for heat. I have no doubt future generations will be as astonished we set fire to them, as we are at 19th century Egyptians burning mummies to fuel their trains.

A significant proportion of the coal we export is coking coal for steel production, which won't be affected by renewables replacing thermal coal.

And to your other point, despite the global astroturf campaigns, nuclear power is expensive and unnecessary in Australia, as well as most of the rest of the world. 

It's interesting as a technology, but the people involved in running it commercially have shown over and over again that they cannot be trusted to do so economically or safely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not exactly.

The Cormack Foundation is normally the biggest annual donor to the Liberal party, and was set up to rely on investments to fund the Coalition. They fund both state and federal Liberal organisations

The foundation's main income comes from:

* The banks, about $2.2 million/yr

* Mining companies, about $750,000/yr

* Grocery chains, notably frequent /r/Australia spammers Westfarmers, about $600,000

* Telstra, about $200,000

* A few investment firms to round off the rest of it.

The purpose of the foundation is essentially to fund the administration and expenses of the Liberal party, or whichever party best represents the views of the foundation's administrators, in perpetuity. 

This is important to note in light of the Cormack administrators decision to fund the Liberal Democrats and Family First last year, and Turnbull's need to chuck in his own $1.75 million. I'd see the funding shortfall and donations to other parties as a warning shot to the LNP moderates, and a reminder who butters their bread.

As to who the Cormack foundation actually are, key figures are their director Hugh Morgan, who's been influencing the Libs environment policy since the late '80s, Murdoch's brother-in-law John Calvert-Jones, banker Charles Goode, and coal miner Viv Forbes. 

While the foundation has existential control over the Liberal party's funding, it's likely the indirect influence over elected officials goes even deeper. The main players get together at events like the Australian Davos Connection meetings held at a private resort on Hayman Island. Given the current government's single-minded anti-renewable focus, it's likely that the incentives offered to individual politicians in private far exceeds the Cormack contributions.

	<TEXT> In the five years 2010-2015, the price of solar PV dropped by 80 per cent, and the price of batteries has fallen on average by 14 per cent every year between 2007 and 2014.

Typical household electricity consumption in Australia is 15-25 units/day, at an average cost of 39c/unit, or between $2000 and $3600 per year.

Currently, a solar system that'll make and store enough electricity to meet that demand is around $20-30k, so around 10 years to pay off the investment.

If both PV and batteries continue their current trends, the threshold where self-generation and the opportunity to go off grid become financially sensible will happen in three or four years.

At that stage, those new "clean" coal power stations will become redundant junk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It may be the bubble burst we have to have, but it doesn't need to have as much impact as it will if left to burst on its own.

It doesn't need to be doom and gloom.

Whichever government is in power at the time can do a lot to offset the damaging effects, or to deflate prices without killing the whole market. Keeping the market fluid is crucial. The worst hardships and social damage happen when homeowners can't downsize because the value of their properties is falling faster then they can pay off their mortgages. 

Things like subsidising genuinely affordable housing and having it available so people with mortgages in negative equity have places to move to. Government can prioritise infrastructure works in outlying regions to develop work opportunities out of major cities, and provide incentives for business to do the same (and additional fees/taxes for those who don't). They can establish rent controls to make tenancy more viable for long term city life. Etc,etc.

There's a huge set of tools to hand for a government with vision and purpose. If Shorten and his team can make use of them, and communicate their vision, they'll could eclipse Keating's moment.

	<TEXT> India, sure... there's a shitshow.

You'd think so, but even there, business has worked out it's cheaper to switch to renewables.

The Indian government has forecast that it will exceed the renewable energy targets set in Paris last year by nearly half and three years ahead of schedule.

A draft 10-year energy blueprint published this week predicts that 57% of Indias total electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027. The Paris climate accord target was 40% by 2030.

The forecast reflects an increase in private sector investment in Indian renewable energy projects over the past year, according to analysts.

The OECD agrees, saying Australia's unemployment benefit has reached the point where it may no longer be effective in "enabling someone to look for a suitable job".

Even the Libs own senate enquiry said there is a compelling case for boosting Newstart.

Despite all that, on Monday Morrison, Porter and Birmingham insisted unemployment benefits need to be cut further.

What is wrong with these people?

Their One Nation preference deal isn't happening to try to save the election - they've given up on that - it's to keep a few senior Liberals from being voted out of what used to be safe seats.

	<TEXT> It's happened a lot more than that, and often successfully.

While rare in Australia, it's been used elsewhere to consolidate systems that are being run for public benefit, and where coordination of assets is needed for efficiency. Railways are a common example.

As a general rule, nationalising to provide infrastructure works well, while nationalising of failing businesses is risky.

	<TEXT> It's time for local and municipal action. Solar and battery storage is on the cusp of being affordable, and reliability could be built in by sharing between households, with council and business participation. 

State and federal government have failed. Large scale power utilities have failed. It's time to go smaller and go local.

Even if some fossil fuel generators (like shipping-container sized gas turbines) have to be temporarily added to the mix, it'll be worth it. 

Getting out of the grid ripoff has to happen sooner rather than later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It comes down to ROI. If it pays for itself quickly enough, people will find ways to buy it. 


Typical household electricity consumption in Australia is 15-25 units/day, at an average cost of 39c/unit, or between $2000 and $3600 per year.

Currently, a solar system that'll make and store enough electricity to meet that demand is around $20-30k, so around 10 years to pay off the investment.

That's borderline, so most people won't get enough benefit to stump up the cash, but if the utilities start charging more for electricity, or the price of the gear falls, Australians will be buying shiploads of them.

Every 5c increase in the price of electricity, or 10% fall in the price of the system will knock a year off the payback time.  I reckon 6 years is the sweet spot - at that stage, utilities will be crossing themselves and saying goodbye. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their timing is perfect too. His message today is basically threatening to cut money for disabled people unless he gets his way on the other welfare cuts.

Carve away at the savings measures as much as you like, but know you'll be tearing money from the pockets Australians with disabilities, Treasurer Scott Morrison has warned.

Every time I think these cunts can't sink any lower, they prove me wrong.

Scum.

	<TEXT> Bankwest is running with it because WA has record high home mortgage delinquencies. They're national, but with most of their customers in the West.


The state has high and rising levels of un or underemployment, and rapidly falling house prices that are leaving home owners in negative equity and unable to sell. Many will end up having no choice to default on the loans as the value of their properties won't pay off enough of the principle to keep them afloat.


It's a nasty trap, and it's only getting worse.

	<TEXT> I know the article, it's based on Brian Wang's analysis in 2011, and is long obsolete given how much new wind and solar has been installed. One of the early criticisms was that it didn't account for lifecycle statistics, which meant that construction fatalities in new renewable industries weighted more heavily than those in nuclear generation, which has been running far longer.

There are also other aspects have also been debunked many times. An example given was that the deaths due to wind generation statistic included 32 people in Brazil who died in a bus accident on the way to work.


The solar figures included some fatalities incurred in very small scale remote area, marine, and industrial installs that aren't part of mainstream electricity production.

TLDR: It's and old and busted news story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are plenty of revenue/cost neutral versions of UBI, and experiments with it in Canada, Uganda and Kenya found that participants often invested in business and skills, and were 65% more likely to start working in a skilled trade.

Within four years, they also worked an average of 25 hours more per month, which works out as 17% more hours than the participants who didnt receive it. That suggests incentives to work are not reduced by introducing UBI and that national productivity would improve.

	<TEXT> Rio, BHP etc have been spending millions on a massive, hostile advertising campaign claiming all the tax money would be spent in in NSW and Vic, while all of the jobs would be lost in WA.

Basically funding a huge "anyone but the Nats" campaign.

It's a brutal, ugly example of direct corporate influence in politics, and it's probably scared the Libs into distancing themselves from the Nats for fear of being dragged down with them.

I'm hoping the reverse will be true, and voters will resent the miners' interference in state politics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a bit different in WA this time though. Brendan Grylls and the Nats are proposing a mining tax. 

So Rio, BHP etc have  been spending millions on a massive, hostile advertising campaign claiming all the tax money would be spent in in NSW and Vic, while all of the jobs would be lost in WA.

Basically funding a huge "anyone but the Nats" campaign.

It's a brutal, ugly example of direct corporate influence in politics, but it could backfire. The public may have a short memory, but not short enough to forget how quickly the big miners retrenched most of their workforces and left the state with a huge debt and little infrastructure to show for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's about a lot more corrupt behaviour than a few "gifts".

The transcripts of Netanyahu's taped negotiations with his supposed arch-nemesis, media mogul Arnon Mozes of the Yediot Ahronot newspaper group, have dominated the national agenda in recent weeks. Netanyahu allegedly promised to promote legislation that would weaken Yediot's main competitor in exchange for more favorable coverage.

It follows previous allegations that Netanyahu improperly accepted lavish gifts from wealthy supporters  including Australian billionaire James Packer and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan  and that his personal attorney, who is also a cousin, represented a German firm involved in a controversial $1.5 billion sale of submarines to Israel.

These follow previous repeated claims that his wife Sara misused state funds for personal use, compounding a public image of Israel's first family as detached hedonists corrupted by years in power.


Don't underplay how bad his behaviour has been. You'll just create more anger. </TEXT>

Agreed, we could just cut the subsidies and let private health insurers demonstrate their ability to offer value, but then they'll remain as powerful lobbyists and political donors, and attempt to regain the corporate welfare.

Better to execute them on the spot. They're leaners, not lifters, after all. </TEXT>
