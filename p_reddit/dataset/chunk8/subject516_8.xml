The court finds no reason to believe that will happen and it's suspicious that they haven't already altered the Order." and much more.

	<TEXT>  You must be really young

Really? Must we always resort to shit like this? I'm 25. 

 Selling out is selling yourself out when you choose to purchase a brand strictly for the ego and recognition that comes with it. 

I'm sorry, but what? There are different ways to "sell out" but I'm not quite sure I understand yours. Are you saying "selling out" is when someone buys a hypebeast brand? That has nothing to do with the Supreme brand "selling out." The term (when used towards public figures/entities) usually means "selling yourself to the man." When I think of the term, I think of when people say independent artists "sell out" and are signed by Interscope. 

 Luxury fashion will never be dead as long as people are willing to pay.

Well, obviously. I wasn't saying the brands would fade away and no one would buy them anymore. Where did I imply that people would stop buying luxury goods? I literally have no idea how you read my posts and thought I implied that. 

 Letters do not mean luxury. Luxury is the quality and materials and craftsmanship.

I agree in regards to Supreme. I don't own any Supreme pieces because (imho) they lack imagination, individuality, and style. With that being said, do you even know what Louis Vuitton is beyond their 15 year old line of purses? How dare you say Nicolas Ghesquiere is "all name and very little quality."

	<TEXT> I never said fashion is dead, that would be ridiculous. I said luxury fashion is dead because the majority of high end brands are owned by the same company and thus can prop up prices and influence trends.

 If you think that's selling out, then maybe wearing a garment strictly for letters written on it is selling out.

If selling your company to *the* fashion conglomerate doesn't constitute "selling out" then what does?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  As with any OS, as more bugs are patched, it gets more secure. 

This is true but not really for the reason you attributed. (You're not wrong, it's just more complicated than that). 

Patching an exploit doesn't really mean there is a dwindling supply of vulnerabilities. Software is constantly changing and every time Apple adds code to their OS then there's a new opportunity. The real reason the OS is getting more secure is that after a literal decade of learning about the attacks of each jailbreak, Apple probably has a much, much higher standard for code safety. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something I've noticed growing up is how much power we have simply through clothing. At the end of the day, it's just fabric and thread. When we put it on it's just as easy to take off. As a man, wearing a dress, skirt, choker, drag, crop tops, etc. can actually cause other people to act in such hateful ways that it's unbelievable. To me, that means you have a certain power over the people who don't understand that cotton is cotton.

	<TEXT> 1. It was only an hour long protest.
2. The NYC taxi industry is predominantly Arab so this was a move to show solidarity with Middle Easterners.
3. Protests are meant to disrupt normal life. If they didn't then we'd hardly even know about them. This was a low-risk move for them (losing fares to/from JFK for an hour) that also got the message out. I mean, here we are talking about it two days later.

Yeah, it probably inconvenienced some people for an hour but I'd argue that temporarily forcing people to take an Uber/Lyft/Train to the airport to loudly protest an unconstitutional and discriminatory act is worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I said to another commenter:

Honestly, they took it back because I taught him what IP67 meant. He initially went to the back to talk to his supervisor about covering it and came back saying "It looks like we will cover it for you under AppleCare but you'll still have to pay $99. See, the ads say 'AppleCare doesn't cover water damage' and 'iPhone is not water proof' so it's your fault." Calmly, I asked if the guy knew what water resistant meant and he said "It means water can get on it without damaging the device." I replied "IP67 rating actually means you can submerge the phone in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes without breaking. Can we agree that the video I showed you wasn't over one meter of water?" "Well, sure." "And can we agree that I probably didn't leave it in the glass for over 30 minutes?" "Probably." "So then can we agree that there was probably a defect in the phone that would have shown up sooner or later because the phone apparently isn't 'water resistant?'" He agreed and then went to the back to talk to the manager and came back to the front ten minutes later and said "Well, it looks like we're going to cover it for you because something must've been wrong with the device."

Sure, maybe they covered it to see what's wrong with it but I literally had to break down what IP67 was to get them to cover it. You make it sound like the Apple Store employee initially said "Wow, that's not right! We'll go grab you a new one immediately! Sorry about this!" Which couldn't be further from the truth.

	<TEXT> My iPhone 7+ broke after [submerging it in a cup of water.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKirVGpgOBF/?taken-by=kawaii_5_0) The home button stopped working, the screen had blue blob that spread over it, and the camera had [water in the lens](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKoDKwgAw2W/?taken-by=kawaii_5_0).

Apple said I had to pay to get it fixed (which is sorta understandable because I dropped it in water on purpose) but I taught the Apple Store "genius" what IP67 meant and they fixed it for free :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who has just started watching MasterChef (just powered through three seasons in a month), I really think Ramsay ges a bad rap. He's never truly "mean," just moreso "angry." Beyond that, he truly cares about seeing people grow and acheive their dreams. Sure, he's tough but the best teachers are the ones that expect the most and are dissapointed when their students fall short. 

Thanks for the clip, I'll watch season 3 next! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're missing out! Ars is one of the last remaining "tech journalism" sites out there. Most other tech news sites simply parrot press releases or add a bit of cynicism without any legitimate analysis of the article content. Ars, on the other hand, is *filled* with not only entertaining content as /u/samred81 mentioned but also really low level analysis of hardware, crazy security/malware articles, and much more.

With that being said, I think trying to reach all the way back to a culture that many of us know nothing about just because there's an example of a hairstyle that many of us know as Bob Marley's hair is a bit contrived. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe the reason people get mad at hair styles is because "when white people wear them, they're fashionable, whereas when POC have worn them, they've historically been fun of for it." Not saying I totally agree with the point but I see the perspective. 

An example I've seen is that when Kylie Jenner wore dreadlocks many people thought they were really cool. On the other hand, many black people are told to shave their dreads because it looks like "they smoke too much weed" or "they don't shower/bathe." This extends outside of high school and also into the job sphere where they're warned not to have hair from their culture if they want a job.

Once again, I understand the perspective but as things progress and these different cultures' symbols become accepted, I can't imagine the sentiment lasting. Theoretically, one day (soon) black children won't feel bad for wearing their culture's hair and I think that's when it would stop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From my understanding, yes. That means we can patch the files, install them (potentially using the built-in sys update feature), and voila! Though I wonder what this means in terms of distribution of files. Right now we have luma3DS which is developer-written which patches the Nintendo code on the fly. Would sighax mean we would have to patch the firmware and sign it ourselves before installing it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, I'm not a legitimate psychologist. I'm a developer by trade but I did go to school for psychology for a year, fwiw. I have a huge interest in psychology and culture and enjoy analyzing their intersection. 

A similar observation you might be interested in is that celebrity deaths this year have been terrible but they will only get worse going forward. Many of our culture's icons are baby boomers so as that group dies off, so will our heroes. It's sad but it's healthier to view it from a logical perspective rather than "this is so sad, all of my childhood heroes are dying!!!" </TEXT>
