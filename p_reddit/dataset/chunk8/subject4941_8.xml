	<TEXT> From CNN:

The bank even **started** one foreclosure over an unpaid bill for 27 cents, according to allegations raised by surviving partners, their relatives and advisers.

So they never ever actually said it was foreclosed just foreclosure proceedings had started over it.

Politico posted a correction

CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect that CIT Bank, successor to OneWest after a 2015 merger, was the entity that filed foreclosure proceedings against Ossie Lofton over a 27-cent payment error. The story has also been revised to clarify that there were two separate foreclosure proceedings against Lofton. At the time the second foreclosure was filed in 2016, Mnuchin had sold his stake in OneWest and was on the board of CIT.

So did the HuffingtonPost 

CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that OneWest had successfully closed on Loftons home. The bank dropped its suit, and is now being countersued. Language has also been amended to reflect that the banks suit was predicated on a shortfall related to an insurance fee, and not a mortgage payment.

So 2 were wrong but corrected themselves and CNN was right. These hardly qualify as fake stories? </TEXT>

Both the Quantum CSS and Quantum Render projects took important steps last week by merging the relevant project branches into the main Firefox source tree.

Whats going on was explained lucidly by a senior Pentagon intelligence official, who stated that since January 20, weve assumed that the Kremlin has ears inside the SITROOM, meaning the White House Situation Room, the 5,500 square-foot conference room in the West Wing where the president and his top staffers get intelligence briefings. Theres not much the Russians dont know at this point, the official added in wry frustration.

You sure? If you have a list of thousands of people you want "disappeared" it'd probably be a good idea to keep track of who actually was killed and who wasn't. If a higher up asks if random terrorist sympathizer Ahmed from Homs was actually killed a paper trail like a sham trial or sham autopsy would probably be needed.

	<TEXT> From someone else on this. . .

I love it when someone cites this article, because it's so easy to utterly destroy.

If we're looking for appeal to authority, Dr. McHugh is contradicting the [official position of the APA](http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx) on the subject. But better yet, we're talking about the kind of man who - after being appointed to the Catholic review board to deal with priests abusing kids in the Church - characterizes it as not a pedophilia issue but rather, and I quote, ["homosexual predation on American Catholic youth"](http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/adopting_chaos).

As for the study he cites, he's referring to to [this Swedish study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) from a few years back. He is correct in noting that post-transition trans people had elevated mortality and suicide rates...but only if they transitioned before 1989 and only compared to the general population (and not to pre-transition trans folks). In fact, they specifically note that there is no such difference for the post-1989 cohort, and other studies demonstrate decreases in suicidality relative to pre-transition folks - both facts that Dr. McHugh conveniently ignores. The study's conclusion specifically notes:

Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.

They're calling for more help, not for less.

So here we have someone with a very clear pre-existing religiously-motivated agenda citing studies to argue against their conclusions and cherry-picking the data convenient for him.
