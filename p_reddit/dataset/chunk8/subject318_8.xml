	<TEXT> Guardians of the Galaxy was a risk for Marvel back in 2014. They were very obscure characters that little people actually knew about. But luckily Marvel hired the terrific director James Gunn to direct and got an amazing cast to play these out-there characters. And the film ended up being a lot of peoples favourite film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

So it made me nervous to see the sequel worried that it wouldnt live up to the beauty of the original. But thankfully it didnt disappoint.

I loved this movie.

The cast are still spectacular. Chris Pratt is as charming as always. Zoe Saldana is a terrific as the complicated Gamora. And wrestler Dave Bautista does another great comedic performance.

And you cant forget about Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vinny D), who stole the show. Rocket has them quips (love me some good quips). And Baby Groot is just so damn cute. SO CUTE!!!

And the new cast are pretty good too. Kurt Russell is awesome as always. And Pom Klementieff as Mantis is pretty funny and interesting and really hope they delve more into her backstory in Volume 3.

But my favourite cast members are the James Gunn movie regulars Michael Rooker (Yondu) and Sean Gunn (Kraglin). Theyre given more screen time then they did in the first film. And its welcomed. Theyre terrific.

Visually this film is by far the most colourful. And its great. Its more fitting to the comics. Which are just splashes of colour on every page. Its probably the best looking film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The soundtrack is a playlist of retro bangers. Especially a song by Cat Stevens which is used terrifically in the film.

This film is pretty spectacular. It does have some pacing issues. But I didn't care. Because I was too busy having fun to really care about it.

Is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 better than than the first? No.
But its very close though.

I definitely recommend this film. Its a space opera spectacular with an amazing cast and breathtaking visuals. And quips.
I love this movie. Can't wait til Volume 3.

9/10
