	<TEXT> I know im barely in Ketosis if i even am, i just feel so fucking weird right now. Its like im on Aderall or speed, if someone is talking too slow on the phone I just wanna hang up on them.

In regards to the 9g in Chobani, isnt that ok since everything else I have been eating is pretty much carb-less? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I have been lurking here for a few weeks and I officially went keto Sunday morning. I ate 3 eggs with cheeses for breakfast, a cup of plain chobani with cut up veggies for lunch, dinner was a couple of chicken breasts with fried eggplants (olive oil). I havent been getting crazy with macros or anything but my goal was staying under 20 net carbs and I did. 

I woke up this morning super tired, and I have had anxiety in the pit of my stomach until about noontime. (Same breakfast and lunch btw). I was also super irritable yesterday before dinner as well at around 11am today. 

This is really weird for me as I dont normally have these emotions and Im wondering if this is all in my head or if I am in some kind of withdrawal. I used to eat rice, bread, pasta or potatoes at least once a day in a hige portion so it makes sense that something is missing but does it happen this quickly? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The flaw in your logic is that because a bunch of bad guys killed a ton of jews a long time ago, we should keep up with tradition. 

Never mind that the main reason they killed the jews was the same reason the Church had so much fun hunting Lutherans as well as literally every single other group, they werent following strict Catholic doctrine. 

We forget that pretty much all of our history from this era was what was written down by abbots and monks. If they decided the jews poisoned the well then all the jews got killed. It had nothing to do with them not wanting to convert, for sure.

	<TEXT> I hope nobody is naive enough to think that the Chinese withdrawal ban is accidentally going to end around the time of the SEC decision. 

The goal by the PBOC is to have the price go to goblin town before the decision so it scares the overly cautious SEC paper pushers. The price of btc is going to keep going down as people need to cash out to fiat so they can withdraw. There is probably no bottom to the price in this kind of situation. 

I dont think "bitcoin is dead" but we are going down for a while to come. I am not going to sell my stash but alot of people will.  </TEXT>
