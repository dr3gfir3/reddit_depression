	<TEXT> You should have no merge conflicts on either Dev-Test or Test-Prod. If something fails on either of those merges, something went terribly wrong.

All integration needs to happen in Dev or earlier.

People shouldn't be regularly working in the same file. Why are they? If they are working in different parts of the file, you probably need to split the code into more files. If they are working in the same functions, you probably need to split the functions into smaller ones.

It might make sense to keep different repos for different clients (it might also make sense to keep it all in one) and to rely on well-versioned artifacts to deal with different clients running different versions of shared code.

All code should flow in one direction only. Code should not be manually committed to Test or Prod. Code should be (semi-, if you need)auto pushed to Test and Prod as part of a scripted build/deploy pipeline. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't know about Breitbart.

I don't know of the ambassador denying any CIA or FBI claims.

Can you link to a specific claim from the CIA or FBI that the dnc-emails and/or podesta-emails sections of WikiLeaks' website contain information delivered to them on behalf of Russia?

A real individual has already claimed to have had legal access to dnc-emails and that they leaked them.

podesta-emails may have been phished, or just brute-forced (weak password). It could have been done by just about anyone.

I'd love to see some information from real sources (CIA or FBI .gov domains over https).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Clinton's emails are implicated in a criminal investigation.

Letter Text:

Dear Messrs. Chairmen: 

I write to supplement my October 28, 2016 letter that notified you the FBI would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former Secretary of State Clinton's use of a personal email server. Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review *a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation*. During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State.

Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton. 

I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.

Sincerely yours, 

James B. Comey

Director
