	<TEXT> Well, in this hypothetical situation, the fights take place in the Octagon. No sneaky ninja tricks or striking from the shadows. Second, yes, Naruto is a superhuman. But, keep in mind these are roughly 500 of the world's greatest athletes and fighters. They may not be superhuman, but they're pretty damn close. And they far outnumber him. All they need do is chip away at him </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those women are fucking tough. I'll admit that for them, it's much more of a numbers game. But, have you ever seen them fight? Men usually stay calm throughout the whole fight. Women, as soon as they get hit good once, get pissed off. I have yet to see a boring female UFC fight. The men most of the time try to get a feel for their opponent's style, and it takes most of the fight, and it can get boring. But the women go balls to the wall (ovaries to the wall?) and try to take each other's heads off </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, first off, that's not everyone in the UFC. The divisions for men go from Flyweight (125 lbs) to Heavyweight (264 lbs). For women, there are two divisions. Strawweight (115 lbs) and Bantamweight (135 lbs). 

If you from what you said, Lightweight (155 lbs) to Heavyweight, I doubt Naruto could make it out of the Lightweight division. You're talking about the division with 100+ fighters and that is arguably the most talent stacked. The longest any Champion has ever been able to hold on to his belt in that division is three successful title defenses. Only two people to my knowledge have ever even managed that. It's the toughest division to make a name for yourself in. You have guys like Gilbert Melendez, Anthony Pettis, Raphael Dos Anjos, and Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone in that division. 

Add in the four other divisions after that with guys like Robbie Lawler, Tyron Woodley, Chris Weidman, Anderson Silva, Lyoto  Machida, Anthony Johnson (Who is an absolutely terrifying combatant by himself) Daniel Cormier, Alexander Gusstaffson, Fabricio Werdum, and Cain Fucking Velasquez, Naruto doesn't stand a chance in the long run. 

If you want *Every* fighter in the UFC, he's even more fucked. He might be able to get through the female divisions more easily (he'll still take an ass kicking though) based on his possible strength advantage, but Joanna HowevertheFuckYouSpellHerName and Ronda Rousey would be motherfuckers to beat even if you're a man. 

Then you have to get through the men's divisions, and I'd say the lighter weight classes in general have far more talented fighters than the heavier weight classes. I wouldn't want to fight Jose Aldo or Demetrious Johnson after fighting everyone and their mother. 

UFC 10/10, 100/100, 10,000/10,000 stomps. Doesn't matter how many times he attempts it. 

TL;DR: A long list of some of the UFC's most talented fighters

Edit: Justus would be very difficult to deal with. But, a skilled enough grappler (like Ronda Rousey or Daniel Cormier) or a fast enough striker (like Demetrious Johnson, Anthony Pettis, or Donald Cerrone) could be able to close the distance to take it to the ground and submit him or knock him out, especially considering he'd be tired as fuck after fighting a shit ton of other talented fighters. Even the guys not in the top 15 of each weight class are in the UFC for a reason </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, that's exactly what I'm wondering, hence my question. Statistically speaking, the straight population outnumbers the GLBT population. So I'm wondering if those statistics might affect gay people psychologically if/when they break up. 

"I live in such a small town. I don't know if I can find someone else."

"I have no place to meet other gay singles in my area. Do I really want to leave him/her?"

Even straight people when they break up wonder if they'll find someone else for them. But the gay population is at a significant disadvantage.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you've ever watched the movies, you'll know that the staircases like to change. They'll rotate 90 degrees and reach up to a new platform. I'm currently trying to think of a way to achieve this with Redstone. I doubt I could get them to change at random intervals, almost like they have free will, but I figured I could use a pressure plate so that if you stand on it while climbing, the steps change. My biggest problem is figuring out how to get them to rotate 90 degrees. Does anyone have any ideas?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Taekwondo is a fantastic art. It teaches you timing and distance. It's also an art that forces you to be creative in competition. The flexibility you gain in your legs from doing Taekwondo would mix marvelously with Muay Thai. 

Also, there's less telegraphing in Taekwondo when throwing a strike. Almost every basic TKD kick starts from the same chamber position: raising your knee up. From there, you quickly position your hips to the technique you want to throw. Muay Thai kicks start from different chambers. So TKD is a much more deceptive art. 

The more you can confuse an opponent, the more the fight will go your way </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They have like a certain... I don't know how to say it... Aura maybe? Or glow? When girls laugh, it's just like one of the sweetest things I can imagine. It's not even something necessarily sexual. I just love making girls laugh. They can be my friend, sister, cousin, or girlfriend. I always love just watching them laugh, or smile, or have that signature super-excited reaction that girls give. 

Now, when they're not family, like a close friend or girlfriend, then I get turned on. But it's not like a "dirty" turned on. It's more of a pure, "that's adorable" turned on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a bad habit of spoiling girls. Or good. I'm not sure which. Not like buying them cars or anything. Just getting them small gifts every now and then that I know will get them excited and make them smile or giggle uncontrollably. 

One friend, for Christmas, I drew her a sketch of Hedwig the Owl (from Harry Potter. She loves HP) and framed it. She freaked out and it made me so happy. 

Another two (twins) were graduating this year, along with me. I got them big posters from The Hobbit. One was a Middle-Earth map, another was just a beautiful collection of characters. Same story, they freaked out and hugged me. 

Also, if I'm just hanging out with any of these girls, I'm always sure to get them a small treat, like ice cream or candy. Just so that I can see them smile. 

None of them ever ask me to buy them anything. I just like surprising them with something small or homemade to get that classic girl-freak-out-I'm-so-happy! reaction.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-28 22:11:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You choose which character, which cheats to activate, etc. Must follow the rules of the cheats. Example: Invincibility lasts 5 minutes, and must be reactivated once it is up. 

List of cheats: 

http://www.cheatcc.com/xboxone/grandtheftauto5cheatscodes.html

The army of Mordor includes the Uruk-hai, wargs, trolls, Mumakil, and Sauron leading them. They have access to war machines such as ballistae, and trebuchets. Takes place at the Black Gate. 

Round one: Sauron without the One Ring, his forces containing 100,000,000 Uruks, and 500,000 troops split among the other assorted monsters. So a total force of 100,500,000 troops, along with war machines and Sauron. 

Round two: Same as Round One, but Sauron now has the Ring.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Gondor is attempting to break through the Black Gate of Mordor. Scouts have confirmed a copious supply of crack the Uruk-hai have been storing away in Udun for years and years. Gondor believes if they use an army of 3000 crack whores, telling them of *their Precious* beyond the Black Gate, they may be able to succeed in getting through the gate and taking Mordor. 

Mordor's forces: The 2000 Uruks on guard at Morrannon. They wield trebuchets and ballistae. 

Gondor's Forces: 3000 crack-lusted crack whores, each wielding weaponry which may commonly be used by a crack whore (broken bottles, coat hangers, trash can lids, lighters and flammable objects, etc.). 

Keep in mind Gondor wants the Gate torn down to allow the rest of Gondor's forces into Mordor. 

Is the crack whore army successful? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was talking to my friend. He says that Brock could count as black. Same with Iris and Archie. I disagree. Think they're all very very tan. Are there any canonically black people in Pokmon?

Edit: Thanks for the great responses guys! It seems to me for the most part, the people who could truly be considered to have African ancestry mostly appear in the newer generations. Just a trend that I saw. Not many mentions of people before Gen V. 

Adding on to this, I love the idea of the next region being based on Africa. Imagine the culture and landscape that Pokemon could draw from the continent. Have a desert that draws from the Sahara, have pyramids you can travel to and go inside. There could be Savannahs with Pokemon you need to chase down to battle and catch. A great rainforest. Travel along a river that spans the entire region. Then the Pokemon themselves could draw from the native animals and the native African cultures. I am in love with this idea! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor's opening sequence. The feels man. 

It sets up the whole game perfectly. It gives you a real reason that almost feels personal for ruining all these Orcs' days.

	<TEXT> Five 3-minutes rounds. Open weight class. Regulation kickboxing gloves. Kickboxing rules. 

Ali is in his prime, as is Lee. Both are very well known for their speed and power. 

Who takes this fight? Is it by KO or decision? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely would! It's horribly beautiful. Far different from Mordor. Very good AI, fantastic story, fun to play with your friends, and the DLC are pretty good. 

My only problem with it are you can't play on a full bladder (at least when you first get it). 

Also, keep in mind, if you play Alien, you have to play it right. In the dark, with the headphones on. Headphones add a completely new experience to the game.  </TEXT>
