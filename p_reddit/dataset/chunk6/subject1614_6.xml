	<TEXT> So IRP stands for the Iron response protein. Normally if Iron is present it attaches to this transcription factor that regulates a gene expression of specific genes by binding to its genomic response element (RE) sequence. IRE just means response element.

Mutations can either add or take away a function from a protein: So based on what you learned can you speculate the possible functions that would result from a mutation to the Iron response protein? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Purely Speculation here but this how I would answer your question: Now there is a possibility are varying phenotypic traits within the population of fish that may give them the ability to survive this threshold event by obtaining nutrition through an alternative food source. Then in the next generation the fish within the population would have undergone a bottleneck effect meaning most of the fish have this new advantageous trait. But realistically they would probably just die off as there food source is now gone. I think it would be more realistic for an already existing trait to be altered instead of developing a new trait altogether (This would take much longer on a geological timescale).  

Edit: Estimating a time scale for developing a whole new physical trait </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm quickly learning the true meaning behind "publish or die" and not resting on your laurels. 

My podcast team is trying to increase visibility. So far we have it on our [website](https://www.radiobio.net/), and [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/music/listen?authuser#/ps/Ilnbdmm2ewbt3xv6afaqhj7gwg4). We've tried submitting it to Itunes but the review period is taking longer than expected. What podcast app are you using? Perhaps we can expand to that?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My advice for experiment design is look at the questions the professor's lab is interested in, research the field a bit more, and then designing the experiment. Alternatively depending on the professor by asking to sit in on group meetings or asking to help out with general lab management tasks is a sure fire way to get involved in a research setting. In order to do this however you will need to maintain a good gpa, show that you can be reliable, you are able to learn, and that you can be self-reliant. The first step is to convince the professor that in time you will contribute to the lab instead of being a hinderance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I can tell you from my experience is that depending on the university and the graduate program there may be an opportunity to be a teaching assistant and that may wave your tuition and give you a salary to work off of. Some of the MSc programs here in California set it up so internships are part of your coursework and that in turn sets you up for a career afterwards. Depending on the medical route you want to pursue you may just need to take some certifications and you should look at that as an investment rather than acquiring more dept.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I put myself in a pickle. Because now people will have a way to link my reddit account to myself. [You played yourself](https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2016/05/02/635977554978812978-1473130514_you%20played%20urself.gif)

I'm a graduate student that just passed their qualification exam. I only have a couple of papers but I know first hand all the hard work that goes into preparing them.
