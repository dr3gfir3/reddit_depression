Like step by step real simple so my friend, no relations of course, can perhaps make some in his home. His home is in another country. In fact I don't even know where he lives that's how little I know about this friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find it fascinating how society has grown to the point where it can easily support someone who stacks furniture in a virtual environment for an entire decade. Take "The Rape of Proserpina" by Italian sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini. At over 2 meters tall and carved from a single block of marble by hand it is undoubtedly one of the greatest masterpieces ever to be created by humanity. It took Bernini one year to make. He was 23 when he made it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You see that's the problem. All these pseudo intellectuals regurgitating others knowledge and not actually creating or doing anything. Let me teardown your post one by one.  "I literally can't think of a single genuinely intellectual Trump supporter" You need to broaden your horizons. Utilizing  "literally" and "single" makes this statement one that is subjective rather than objective. This statement clearly indicates that even if a person generally falls into the category of  an  "intellectual" in your frame of reference if they are also a Trump supporter that this is an impossibility. Since they do not agree with you, their mindset must be incorrect. This is a logical fallacy.  "displayed an aggressive disinterest in critical thinking"    "employing the most basic, middle-school level reading and writing skills" First, the irony of stating middle school writing skills and then  proceeding in the same sentence to incorrectly hyphenate "middle-school". Second, what is aggressive disinterest? How does one actively seek impartiality? This is one of those phrases that sound great, but make no logical sense.  "they were informed and they had the best interest of the country in mind."  "for 30 years now, I've watched the Right getting progressively more belligerent, more crass and more interested in ideology than in empirical fact." That's quite some mental gymnastics here. Is the GOP "informed" or are they "ignorant"?  "it's only going to get worse before it gets better." Oh I love these. Another one of those "sounds good" statements that state the complete obvious in a riddle like manner. You also started both sentences in your last statement with "And". Also something you would have learned in middle school. I guess it's not just the GOP or Trump supporters with  "basic, middle-school level reading and writing skills" </TEXT>

After taming, its diet remains the same (Black Pearls, Meat and Fish).

However, Tusoteuthis will now eat Black Pearls individually at 30 Food each. It was moving "backwards" as in tentacles forward. Server restart did fix it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tusoteuthis issues on Center Map. The first one we tamed died just 15min after taming due to a slow damage tick. There was nothing attacking it (not it combat) Had a 300lvl mosa as a guard. We had three people pumping meat into it to try to keep it alive, moved it into our water pen. Nothing worked. It just slowly died. We wrote it off as a strange glitch. Second tamed Tusoteuthis is still alive, but locked in place after moving it to just outside our water pen. It swims in "reverse" (tentacles facing forward) really slowly. Won't follow other dinos or survivors. When you dismount it after slow moving it for awhile it just rubber bands you back to where you started. On your screen you see it move, other see you just sitting on it in the same place. Also tried claiming and reclaiming it. Seems like some sort of server stasis issue. We all logged out of stasis range...still no joy. Waiting for a server restart to see if that fixes it.
