	<TEXT> I have one lv 110 toon, which is my main of course. Im a very casual player (fucked up work schedule, GF, kid on the way) and i dont have a lot of time to play, but i do want to make my playing time as efficient as possible.

Im trying to shuffle some gold lately, were doing flasks but no luck with rank 3, now im doing the trinket shuffle which is decent. But since i don't play alot, i burn trough BoS too quickly. I have Alchemy and Herbalism. But farming BoS with herba is too random.

My point is: should i change herba to skinning? Or should i lv up my alt (dk lv 90 or warrior from scratch), and use one of those for skinning and lw or something else.

Not trying to be lazy, i just don't wanna lose herbalism if its not worth it, and i dont have much xp with other professions to make a judgement call by myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have only one 110 char with alch and herbalism. I am quite a casual player, so i dont have alot of time to run heroics for bloods. Should i drop herbalism for skinning? Im having trouble acquiring bloods for my trinket shuffle.

Or is it better to get my other char (90 dk) to 110 and get him skinning?  </TEXT>
