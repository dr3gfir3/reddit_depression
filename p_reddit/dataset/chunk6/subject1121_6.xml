1). shareblue and CTR and others are still paying a buttload of money to make a ton of comments against trump, and promptly deleting them to create the illusion of censorship (which would have happened anyways, since t_d heavily censors

	<TEXT> There is a traffic guide on the sidebar which may be helpful. 

Basically you want to follow a sort of road hierarchy, with highways being like a spine with zero stoplights  (only on and off ramps), connecting avenues with minimal stop lights (try using two sets of one way roads to give a sort of "divided highway" style of Avenue) and then filling if out with roads, which would be local traffic only. It's hard to tell for sure what exactly is causing your traffic (probably people from the highway needing to travel a long ways to an industrial area) but keeping good road hierarchy will make all of your traffic a lot smoother and your cities more logical  </TEXT>

The presidents budget cuts funding for early-childhood education, public housing, transit, food assistance, and job training  all programs that disproportionately benefit single mothers in cities with low median incomes. And it also abolishes the Appalachian Regional Commission and Rural Business-Cooperative Service, while shrinking the Labor Department  all moves that disadvantage coal miners.

	<TEXT> There is more to college than job prep. People with this thought process undervalue quality education as a whole.

Beyond that, if we cut student loans/grants for low paying fields (say, the arts), then we create a culture where all commercial art is made by the upper class. There is already a huge class based barrier to entry in the arts, and prohibiting poorer students from attending good art school will kill a lot of opportunities for poor aspiring artists. Sure, they can learn a lot on their own, but without schools they will have less access to networking, mentors, solid critique, etc.  </TEXT>

Right now, to live without a cell phone or internet (you really only *need* one or the other I suppose) is to pretty solidly disconnect from a lot of society (possibly less so in rural environments and impoverished communities).

obviously, hufffpo is pretty biased. That said, its entirely likely that this instance of anti gay discrimination by a muslim bakery is a bit of a sham

However, IF a bakery that bakes wedding cakes as one of their services were to refuse to bake a gay wedding cake, on the basis of the gayness of the wedding, I'd personally stop shopping there (and would support them being a target of a anti discrimination lawsuit) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If instead of that, I took to the internet and complained over and over about how I spent good money on my hamburger, and the restaurant is anti-consumer, and how charging me for ketchup packets is an outrage, what would you think of me?

I mean...people do that. Look at Yelp. Look at tripadvisor.  There are whole websites designed to critiquing food establishments. 

If I'm unhappy with that restaurant's hamburgers, I need to shut the hell up and stop buying that restaurant's hamburgers. If all restaurants start making shit hamburgers, then maybe I need to go try a taco joint or something because hamburgers aren't cutting it anymore.

For my sake, if you eat a particularly bad burger, PLEASE complain so I know not to waste money on it. 

This analogy is terrible, its as if you have never eaten out before </TEXT>

	<TEXT> its like when I get a coffee and they serve me the bottom of the pot stuff. I mean, sure, Im not hurting for the lack of $1.50. they technically served me the coffee I asked for. But i still have the right to complain that its overly bitter and stale. 

I paid $25 for cities skylines. for how much I play versus how much i payed, one of the best investments I have made. However, I can still complain about the many aspects of the game that are lacking. Its just the way things work </TEXT>

The food menu was meh, but I loved the drinks and the atmosphere, great last stop during a night out. i went there for their last day open on a whim, thinking it had been too long since I had gone there.

As for why, they say it is while they "re evaluate" their business model, so I bet they are just not making enough money to justify being open. I never saw them super crowded, except during summer </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree, though I think TFA could have been stronger for sure. Try to think, what would the new trilogy have looked like if ROTJ's aftermath had been peachy?  I can't imagine it being very interesting.

Whats cool about TFA, even if it is a bit depressing, is showing just how hard nation building is, and showing how even the best revolutions can lead to weak, ineffective governments prone to insurrections. This opens up some ground for the movies to have more gray area morality (though TFA has not taken advantage of this). In that sense, there is a potential for the sequel trilogy to be the perfect middle ground between the politics of the PT and the pulpy action + spirituality of the OT. Whether they take the opportunity is anyone's guess at this point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Calvin and Hobbes is great, one of my favorites, no doubt.

Since I cant change your taste, I instead wanted to address the idea of "best". Calvin and Hobbes, for all of its greatness, sticks to a pretty conventional set up.  There is no real evolution or growth of the characters.

I think Doonesbury takes the comic format to a new level, managing to be funny, tell a serialized story, and remain politically relevant for like 40 years now. If we are looking at objective best, rather than subjective best, I think Doonesbury is unparalleled in terms of what it does with the format  </TEXT>
