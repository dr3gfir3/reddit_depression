	<TEXT> The show in general isn't even that bad but my point is that they literally locked Dan Harmon in with a couple of cases of beer and one or two whiskey bottles, recorded his drunken rambling and turned it into an episode.

	<TEXT>  Also, you're doing Rick   Morty a huge disservice, the show is a lot more intelligent than just "nihilistic cartoon about alcoholic scientist".

True, I forgot to mention the drunken incoherent voice-acting, where Dan Harmon just weirdly improvises scenes and they do all the animation later. 

They actually aired that, unbelievable </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are shows about cute anime girls not socially acceptable but nihilistic cartoons about an alcoholic scientist are? 

Seems to me like it should be the other way around. 

Or is it the usual US bias that everything American is valuable and everything foreign should be despised? </TEXT>
