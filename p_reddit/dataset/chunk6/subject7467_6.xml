	<TEXT> Oh really ? Sounds good indeed! Im French so I have no idea, this was when I was in a Aussie restaurant. So you would put whipped cream even though there is already raspberry filling ?  Or you would do it with a plain lamington ? Are plain lamington the ones with cocoa and rum icing right ?

	<TEXT> Nop. The icing is wet, the sponge is buttery fluffy and the raspberry filling is made of raspberry puree 10% sugar and pectin to hold it a bit. The humidity of the raspberry filling gets into the sponge as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Omg yes Orochi bots are by far the most annoying ones IMO. Yesterday they made me rage quit the campain on the viking mission with the valkyrie on hard, there like 6 of them on the same small section. I died 4 times and the respawn is frustrating as you need to do the whole section again </TEXT>
