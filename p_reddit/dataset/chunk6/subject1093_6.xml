	<TEXT> Hey /u/kartoastro! Thank you for your submission!    

Unfortunately it has been removed because your submission must be a direct link to an image or an album of images. Please feel free to re-submit using a direct image link (must end in jpg, gif, png, etc). Blogs, social media, and similar types of websites **will not be approved**, as per Rule 4.

Also, if your link ends in ?1 please remove that and anything else extraneous before submitting. 

---

#####Also, we just started working on a whitelist for legitimate, reputable news sites related to the arts world. If your post links to such a website, please send us a modmail so that we can add it to the whitelist. Again, no blogs.

Thanks for understanding! 3

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

When you find the series you are looking for, it would be  appreciated if you added the title of the series as a [Flair](http://i.imgur.com/x307DTk.png) by the title of the post that way others will know that the answer has been found. This also allows others that have become interested based off your description to try the series for themselves.

Our community would love to help, but you should also post to /r/tablets to get a wider variety of advice. That subreddit is specifically about tablets (iPad and Windows as well as Android), so they should be able to answer your question just as good (or better) than we can!

Your post has been removed because it links to an unapproved domain. While links to other domains are permitted here, they do require moderator review.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

You have a couple of options:

1. If you are submitting a completed project that meets the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines), and you made the project yourself, you may message the moderators to request that your post be manually reviewed.

2. If you are asking for help with a specific aspect of a DIY project, and are linking to a website to explain your problem, please use the [Submit a Help Request](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/submit?selftext=true) link instead. Include the link to the website in the text of the post, and also include additional context and details so that others may help you more easily.

3. If you're asking a question that doesn't meet the "specific question about an *aspect* of a DIY project" requirement, such as "how can I fix the problem shown in this website" or "how can I make the project shown in this website", such posts generally do not meet the help request requirements in our [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines). Consider asking your question in the [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY, rather than creating a new post.

Remember that all posts are required to meet the posting guidelines. We encourage you to read the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines) for more information.

If you believe your link meets the posting requirements, please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDIY message=Please%20review%20my%20non-Imgur%20submission%20at%20https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/6abvgr/diy_gifts_mothers_day_gift_idea/).

If you're trying to post a product/promotion, or trying to drive traffic to your website, please see [reddit's spam rules here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F), and if you fall into that category, please go somewhere else.

If you're unsure of what tag to use, then [Question] or [Discussion] would probably work for most borderline cases. Thanks!

Tag | Usage
:--|:--
[Release] | New tweaks that have just been released or submitted
[Update] | Existing tweaks that have just been updated
[Beta] | Tweaks currently in beta
[Upcoming] | Tweaks currently in development
[News] | Tweak and jailbreak related news
[Discussion] | Jailbreak related discussions where anyone can give their opinion. For example, favorite/recommended tweaks, tweak concepts, tweak configurations, etc.
[Question] or [Help]| Troubleshooting jailbreak or tweak related issues and questions
[Request] | Requests for a tweak to be made or updated
[Tutorial] | How-to posts
[Meta] | Posts about /r/jailbreak itself
[Giveaway] | Theme or tweak giveaways
[Tip] | Shorter how-to posts

**NOTE: ** If you wish to use multiple tags, please do not "split" your tags like this: `[Question/Discussion]`. They should be separate like this: `[Question] [Discussion]`.

For more information, please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/38uktc/meta_link_flair_system/)

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abvf6/best_domain_name_to_start_make_money_online_blog/).

	<DATE> 2017-05-10 12:07:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This thread is intended for users to post any questions they may have about potential, pending, or completed trades for advice or feedback. 

For the best replies/advice/feedback, be clear on what you're trying to trade and what you're looking for in return.

Posting something like "What is 'Card A' worth?" won't elicit great responses. Everybody places different values on different cards.

Instead, post something like "I have 'Card A', would asking for 'Card B' 1:1 be fair?" or "Someone is offering 'Card A'   'Card B' for 'Card C'. Which side of the trade would you rather be on?"

These type of specific scenarios are more likely to be responded to as it is much easier to give input on them that "What can I get for 'Card A'?"

	<TEXT> Hi there!
    
I regret to tell you that your post has been automatically removed because you did not include one of the required title tags. 
    
Please try to post again **using one of the tags from [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3f0jmg/meta_list_of_valid_title_tags_and_their/)**. A correct title would look something like this: "[Tag] This is the title of my post". Make sure to use square brackets. 
    
For an explanation of this rule, please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3f0jla/meta_weve_done_a_link_flair_overhaul_compulsory/).
    
Thank you!

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

	<TEXT> **/u/Spotred, Your submission title isn't right for listentothis!** We have to remove it.

Artist Name -- Song Name [genre genre] (year) 

For example: Three Trapped Tigers -- Reset [math rock] (2012) 

The ' -- ' spaces around the dash and the [brackets around the genres] must be included.

Click on the 'delete' option above to remove this before submitting again.

The submission guidelines are summarized on the submit page for quick reference.

The reasons for these community guidelines are explained in the [subreddit introduction.](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette)

If reddit displays a message telling you to wait a little while before submitting again, moderators are NOT able to assist with this. This is a site-wide feature, and the message will not appear once your account age and total karma exceed required thresholds. [Verifying your email address](http://reddit.com/verify) can help resolve this issue.

	<TEXT> Hello preciuosplatinum! Thanks for your submission. Unfortunately, your submissions has been removed from /r/Art because we noticed it most likely does not comply with Rule 1. Here are our title guidelines:

* Your artwork - "Title, Medium, Size"    
* Another artist's work - "Title, Artist, Medium, Year"    
* Album of artworks - "Collection of my (or another artist's) work, Medium."    
*News article - "Title, Year"

For digital works, the size can either be in pixels or in the intended printed dimension of the work. Please resubmit following the guidelines in the sidebar, and if you feel like your post adheres to our subreddit guidelines please feel free to message the mods. Thanks!

	<TEXT> Hey /u/preciuosplatinum! Thank you for your submission!    

Unfortunately it has been removed because your submission must be a direct link to an image or an album of images. Please feel free to re-submit using a direct image link (must end in jpg, gif, png, etc). Blogs, social media, and similar types of websites **will not be approved**, as per Rule 4.

Also, if your link ends in ?1 please remove that and anything else extraneous before submitting.

#####Also, we just started working on a whitelist for legitimate, reputable news sites related to the arts world. If your post links to such a website, please send us a modmail so that we can add it to the whitelist. Again, no blogs.

Thanks for understanding! 3

Questions about the human body rarely are.** Please consider another subreddit carefully before messaging the mods.
