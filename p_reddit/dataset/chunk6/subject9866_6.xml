	<TEXT> Ecologist swimming into this very popular repost. Great photos!

I really love the deep sea stuff and have a BS in Marine and Environmental Biology and Policy. Though working more with birds and arthropods after my BS, I love returning to my Marine Biology roots. :)

Here's the run-down of animals in the photos:

1. A type of chimera shark ([Order Chimaeriformes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimaera))
2. Sea spider ([Class Pycnogonida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_spider))
3. [Black scabbardfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_scabbardfish) (*Aphanopus carbo*)
4. Grenadier also called Rattail  [\(Family Macrouridae\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenadiers_\(fish\))
5. Is my favorite, some kind of Lumpsucker [Family Cyclopteridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpsucker)
6. Looks like a [*Lophius* spp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lophius) angler fish

	<TEXT> An interesting quote from the news article:

"It's important to understand the role that wolves play in ecosystems and to not assume that smaller predators ... perform the same ecological functions," Benson said. "If coyotes start hammering white-tailed deer, and deer start to decline, then (coyotes) can just eat rabbits or squirrels or garbage but continue to prey on deer, too. So we think that could be a destabilizing element.

It's important to remember when an animal is no longer a major player in an ecosystem that vacuum needs to be filled and it doesn't always fill with the best choice. Large predators such as wolves are incredibly important when it comes to controlling the population of large herbivores which in turn control the populations of plant life and plant biodiversity which can completely change the ecological landscape. 

Every organism is so intimately connected, it's a house of cards. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Understanding the ecological roles of species that influence ecosystem processes is a central goal of ecology and conservation biology. Eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) have ascended to the role of apex predator across much of eastern North America since the extirpation of wolves (Canis spp.) and there has been considerable confusion regarding their ability to prey on ungulates and their ecological niche relative to wolves. Eastern wolves (C. lycaon) are thought to have been the historical top predator in eastern deciduous forests and have previously been characterized as deer specialists that are inefficient predators of moose because of their smaller size relative to gray wolves (C. lupus). We investigated intrinsic and extrinsic influences on per capita kill rates of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces) during winter by sympatric packs of eastern coyotes, eastern wolves, and admixed canids in Ontario, Canada to clarify the predatory ability and ecological roles of the different canid top predators of eastern North America. Eastern coyote ancestry within packs negatively influenced per capita total ungulate (deer and moose combined) and moose kill rates. Furthermore, canids in packs dominated by eastern coyote ancestry consumed significantly less ungulate biomass and more anthropogenic food than packs dominated by wolf ancestry. Similar to gray wolves in previous studies, eastern wolves preyed on deer where they were available. However, in areas were deer were scarce, eastern wolves killed moose at rates similar to those previously documented for gray wolves at comparable moose densities across North America. Eastern coyotes are effective deer predators, but their dietary flexibility and low kill rates on moose suggest they have not replaced the ecological role of wolves in eastern North America. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The importance of understanding the geographic distribution of the full annual cycle of migratory birds has been increasingly highlighted over the past several decades. However, the difficulty of tracking small birds between breeding and wintering areas has hindered progress in this area. To learn more about Kirtland's warbler Setophaga kirtlandii movement patterns throughout the annual cycle, we deployed archival light-level geolocators across their breeding range in Michigan. We recovered devices from 27 males and analyzed light-level data within a Bayesian framework. We found that most males wintered in the central Bahamas and exhibited a loop migration pattern. In both fall and spring, departure date was the strongest predictor of arrival date, but in spring, stopover duration and migration distance were also important. Though stopover strategies varied, males spent the majority of their spring migration at stopover sites, several of which were located just before or after large ecological barriers. We argue that loop migration is likely a response to seasonal variation in prevailing winds. By documenting a tight link between spring departure and arrival dates, we provide a plausible mechanism for previously documented carry-over effects of winter rainfall on reproductive success in this species. The migratory periods remain the least understood periods for all birds, but by describing Kirtland's warbler migration routes and timing, and identifying locations of stopover sites, we have begun the process of better understanding the dynamics of their full annual cycle. Moreover, we have provided managers with valuable information on which to base future conservation and research priorities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in. I love this gif! I've seen it all over Reddit and it never gets old.

Cardinalfish (family [Apogonidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogonidae)) swallow [ostracods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracod) accidentally while looking for plankton. They are herbivorous and not really into snacking on crustaceans. To avoid being digested the ostracods evolved a pretty amazing defense; lighting up which brings full attention to whatever just swallowed them. Since the cardinalfish is translucent (which is usually beneficial in the dark depths), their glowing bodies make them easy targets for predators. Once the fish lights up it spits out the ostracod to save itself from predation.

A bit about our friends the ostrocods: bioluminescent light is produced as the result of a chemical reaction, typically the oxidation of a photon-emitting compound known as [luciferin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin). Some ostracods have a light organ which produces the luciferin known as coelenterazine. More on bioluminescence in [this *How Stuff Works* article](http://animals.howstuffworks.com/animal-facts/bioluminescence2.htm).

There was a decent article from Gizmodo on this video [here](http://gizmodo.com/what-kind-of-demon-sorcery-created-this-laser-spitting-1631483648/1631636301). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist jumping in. Cheetahs are so beautiful and probably my favorite big cat.

[Cheetahs](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/cheetah/) are pretty scary, but out of the big cats of Africa I'd much rather be face to face with a cheetah.

The cheetah is the only living (extant) member of its genus, *[Acinonyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinonyx)*. These beautiful cats are generally friendlier towards humans than the other big cats. This may be due to their smaller size (77 to 143 lbs vs 265 to 420 lbs [African lion](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/african-lion/?source=A-to-Z)!) and that we are nothing like the fast moving prey they are used to hunting. If you don't run (act like prey) they likely won't treat you like prey. And if you do run, cheetahs can reach a top burst speed of 70 mph so good luck!

Cheetahs also have [non-retractable claws](https://susieweeksphotography.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/16-cheetah-claws.jpg). This means they stay out all the time, like a dog or wolf's claws. You can see in the photo they are sharp, but much blunter than say [a lion's claws](https://christiansperka.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/20130513-cs2_0028-e-sig.jpg) (you can see the claw sheath clearly in the photo, just like your house cat's!). They lose some of that edge by constantly being out and worn down as the cat walks or runs.

Cheetahs become pretty friendly with their handlers when in zoos and seem to do well in big cat sanctuaries. Around 1700 B.C., ancient Egyptians became [the first to tame the cheetahs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah#Taming). They were used by Pharaohs as hunting companions. This is not to say they would make good pets! No big cats should ever be pets. They're wild and unpredictable and even zookeepers get mauled on occasion. It only takes one cheetah tantrum to lose a hand or worse.

All that being said, it is certainly not unheard of for people to be attacked by cheetahs:

Poor [Adam Sandler](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2360372/Adam-Sandler-attacked-cheetah-African-safari-I-thought-I-going-die.html) bent down near a watering hole which seemed to trigger a predatory response in a cheetah while he was visiting Africa.

And a [woman who was working at a big cat conservation center](http://www.today.com/id/23914554/ns/today-today_ncheetah ews/t/cheetah-mauling-victim-says-she-assumed-risk/#.VaAYE_m6f-s) was mauled in 2008. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The origins of the five groups of living seed plants, including the single relictual species Ginkgo biloba, are poorly understood, in large part because of very imperfect knowledge of extinct seed plant diversity. Here we describe well-preserved material from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia of the previously enigmatic Mesozoic seed plant reproductive structure Umaltolepis, which has been presumed to be a ginkgophyte. Abundant new material shows that Umaltolepis is a seed-bearing cupule that was borne on a stalk at the tip of a short shoot. Each cupule is umbrella-like with a central column that bears a thick, resinous, four-lobed outer covering, which opens from below. Four, pendulous, winged seeds are attached to the upper part of the column and are enclosed by the cupule. Evidence from morphology, anatomy, and field association suggests that the short shoots bore simple, elongate Pseudotorellia leaves that have similar venation and resin ducts to leaves of living Ginkgo. Umaltolepis seed-bearing structures are very different from those of Ginkgo but very similar to fossils described previously as Vladimaria. Umaltolepis and Vladimaria do not closely resemble the seed-bearing structures of any living or extinct plant, but are comparable in some respects to those of certain Peltaspermales and Umkomasiales (corystosperms). Vegetative similarities of the Umaltolepis plant to Ginkgo, and reproductive similarities to extinct peltasperms and corystosperms, support previous ideas that Ginkgo may be the last survivor of a once highly diverse group of extinct plants, several of which exhibited various degrees of ovule enclosure. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Bone strength is influenced by bone geometry, density, and bone microarchitecture, which adapt to increased mechanical loads during growth. Physical activity (PA) is essential for optimal bone strength accrual; however, less is known about how sedentary time influences bone strength and its determinants. Thus, our aim was to investigate the prospective associations between PA, sedentary time, and bone strength and its determinants during adolescence. We used HR-pQCT at distal tibia (8% site) and radius (7% site) in 173 girls and 136 boys (aged 9 to 20 years at baseline). We conducted a maximum of four annual measurements at the tibia (n=785 observations) and radius (n=582 observations). We assessed moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary time with accelerometers (ActiGraph GT1M). We aligned participants on maturity (years from age at peak height velocity) and fit a mixed-effects model adjusting for maturity, sex, ethnicity, leg muscle power, lean mass, limb length, dietary calcium, and MVPA in sedentary time models. MVPA was a positive independent predictor of bone strength (failure load [F.Load]) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) at the tibia and radius, total area (Tt.Ar) and cortical porosity (Ct.Po) at the tibia, and negative predictor of load-to-strength ratio at the radius. Sedentary time was a negative independent predictor of Tt.Ar at both sites and Ct.Po at the tibia and a positive predictor of cortical thickness (Ct.Th), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and cortical bone mineral density (Ct.BMD) at the tibia. Bone parameters demonstrated maturity-specific associations with MVPA and sedentary time, whereby associations were strongest during early and mid-puberty. Our findings support the importance of PA for bone strength accrual and its determinants across adolescent growth and provide new evidence of a detrimental association of sedentary time with bone geometry but positive associations with microarchitecture. This study highlights maturity-specific relationships of bone strength and its determinants with loading and unloading. Future studies should evaluate the dose-response relationship and whether associations persist into adulthood.  2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. </TEXT>

Crows are highly intelligent birds and with that intelligence comes a need for stimulation. So aside from stealing food, they sometimes exhibit behaviors like this for amusement. They get bored, just like we get bored or any other animal with free time not devoted to foraging, mating or sleeping.

Crows are frequently seen doing silly things to keep themselves amused. For instance:

**Abstract:**

Theria comprises all but three living mammalian genera and is one of the most ecologically pervasive clades on Earth. Yet, the origin and early history of therians and their close relatives (i.e., cladotherians) remains surprisingly enigmatic. A critical biological function that can be compared among early mammal groups is mastication. Morphometrics and modeling analyses of the jaws of Mesozoic mammals indicate that cladotherians evolved musculoskeletal anatomies that increase mechanical advantage during jaw rotation around a dorsoventrally-oriented axis (i.e., yaw) while decreasing the mechanical advantage of jaw rotation around a mediolaterally-oriented axis (i.e., pitch). These changes parallel molar transformations in early cladotherians that indicate their chewing cycles included significant transverse movement, likely produced via yaw rotation. Thus, I hypothesize that cladotherian molar morphologies and musculoskeletal jaw anatomies evolved concurrently with increased yaw rotation of the jaw during chewing cycles. The increased transverse movement resulting from yaw rotation may have been a crucial evolutionary prerequisite for the functionally versatile tribosphenic molar morphology, which underlies the molars of all therians and is retained by many extant clades. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The influence of fission-fusion dynamics, i.e., temporal variation in group size and composition, on social complexity has been studied in large-brained mammals that rely on social bonds. Little is known about birds, even though some species like ravens have recently received attention for their socio-cognitive skills and use of social bonds. While raven breeders defend territories year-round, non-breeders roam through large areas and form groups at food sources or night roosts. We here examined the fission-fusion patterns of non-breeding ravens over years, investigating whether birds meet repeatedly either at the same or at different locations. We combined four large datasets: presence-absence observations from two study sites (Austria, Italy) and GPS-tracking of ravens across two study areas (Austria, France). As expected, we found a highly dynamic system in which individuals with long phases of temporary settlement had a high probability of meeting others. Although GPS-tagged ravens spread out over thousands of square kilometres, we found repeated associations between almost half of the possible combinations at different locations. Such a system makes repeated interactions between individuals at different sites possible and likely. High fission-fusion dynamics may thus not hinder but shape the social complexity of ravens and, possibly, other long-term bonded birds. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

In the setting of profound ocular blindness, numerous lines of evidence demonstrate the existence of dramatic anatomical and functional changes within the brain. However, previous studies based on a variety of distinct measures have often provided inconsistent findings. To help reconcile this issue, we used a multimodal magnetic resonance (MR)-based imaging approach to provide complementary structural and functional information regarding this neuroplastic reorganization. This included gray matter structural morphometry, high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) of white matter connectivity and integrity, and resting state functional connectivity MRI (rsfcMRI) analysis. When comparing the brains of early blind individuals to sighted controls, we found evidence of co-occurring decreases in cortical volume and cortical thickness within visual processing areas of the occipital and temporal cortices respectively. Increases in cortical volume in the early blind were evident within regions of parietal cortex. Investigating white matter connections using HARDI revealed patterns of increased and decreased connectivity when comparing both groups. In the blind, increased white matter connectivity (indexed by increased fiber number) was predominantly left-lateralized, including between frontal and temporal areas implicated with language processing. Decreases in structural connectivity were evident involving frontal and somatosensory regions as well as between occipital and cingulate cortices. Differences in white matter integrity (as indexed by quantitative anisotropy, or QA) were also in general agreement with observed pattern changes in the number of white matter fibers. Analysis of resting state sequences showed evidence of both increased and decreased functional connectivity in the blind compared to sighted controls. Specifically, increased connectivity was evident between temporal and inferior frontal areas. Decreases in functional connectivity were observed between occipital and frontal and somatosensory-motor areas and between temporal (mainly fusiform and parahippocampus) and parietal, frontal, and other temporal areas. Correlations in white matter connectivity and functional connectivity observed between early blind and sighted controls showed an overall high degree of association. However, comparing the relative changes in white matter and functional connectivity between early blind and sighted controls did not show a significant correlation. In summary, these findings provide complimentary evidence, as well as highlight potential contradictions, regarding the nature of regional and large scale neuroplastic reorganization resulting from early onset blindness. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being used globally to conserve marine resources. However, whether many MPAs are being effectively and equitably managed, and how MPA management influences substantive outcomes remain unknown. We developed a global database of management and fish population data (433 and 218 MPAs, respectively) to assess: MPA management processes; the effects of MPAs on fish populations; and relationships between management processes and ecological effects. Here we report that many MPAs failed to meet thresholds for effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff and financial resources. Although 71% of MPAs positively influenced fish populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: MPAs with adequate staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than MPAs with inadequate capacity. Thus, continued global expansion of MPAs without adequate investment in human and financial capacity is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation outcomes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_sneeze_reflex), photic sneezing affects 1835% of the population in the United States.

I have that issue and anytime I walk out into sunlight, especially after being in a somewhat dim room, it triggers a prolonged sneeze response. At least three sneezes in a row. It can be kind of handy when I have a tickle in my nose and I can't get a sneeze out, I'll just look at a bright light and it usually works. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Research has indicated that many video games are saturated with stereotypes of women and that these contents may cultivate sexism. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between video game exposure and sexism for the first time in a large and representative sample. Our aim was also to measure the strength of this association when two other significant and well-studied sources of sexism, television exposure and religiosity, were also included in a multivariate model. A representative sample of 13520 French youth aged 1119 years completed a survey measuring weekly video game and television exposure, religiosity, and sexist attitudes toward women. Controlling for gender and socioeconomic level, results showed that video game exposure and religiosity were both related to sexism. Implications of these results for future research on sexism in video games are discussed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! Behavioral Ecologist here. While not a primatologist, I would not post a video if I believed the subject was in distress. Twirling in gorillas though is common in young and adults as a form of play. I'm on mobile so I'll find other sources later, but [this link here](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Doubts_about_behavior_gorillas_coast) is a discussion about this behavior (and this video is linked) by a primatologist graduate student (in 2016 who had been studying them since 2009, specifically behavior) who mentions the spinning as play.

Thank you for your concern!  

Edit - 

[Primate Info Net](http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/aboutp/behavior/gorillas2.html) has an entire list from several published journal articles about gorilla behavior. Spinning is listed under play in several papers within this giant list.

Here is a paper called [*Play Behavior in Infant Western Lowland Gorillas
\(Gorilla gorilla gorilla\) at the Lincoln Park Zoo*](http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1153 context=uhp_theses) which mentions spinning in infants on page 14.

[Daily Mail article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3538040/Is-new-Prima-te-Ballerina-Incredible-moment-young-gorilla-dances-perfect-pirouette-inside-enclosure.html) about a juvenile spinning for play. While the Daily Mail is total garbage, they do have quotes from the zookeepers.

[A news article about the same gorilla](http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/video-gorilla-dancing-twycross-zoo-gets-viewed/story-29106263-detail/story.html), again with quotes from the primate keeper at the zoo. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Demographic data on wild chimpanzees are crucial for understanding the evolution of chimpanzee and hominin life histories, but most data come from populations affected by disease outbreaks and anthropogenic disturbance. We present survivorship data from a relatively undisturbed and exceptionally large community of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We monitored births, deaths, immigrations, and emigrations in the community between 1995 and 2016. Using known and estimated ages, we calculated survivorship curves for the whole community, for males and females separately, and for individuals 2 years old when identified. We used a novel method to address age estimation error by calculating stochastic survivorship curves. We compared Ngogo life expectancy, survivorship, and mortality rates to those from other chimpanzee communities and human hunter-gatherers. Life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 32.8 years, far exceeding estimates of chimpanzee life expectancy in other communities, and falling within the range of human hunter-gatherers (i.e., 2737 years). Overall, the pattern of survivorship at Ngogo was more similar to that of human hunter-gatherers than to other chimpanzee communities. Maximum lifespan for the Ngogo chimpanzees, however, was similar to that reported at other chimpanzee research sites and was less than that of human-hunter gatherers. The absence of predation by large carnivores may contribute to some of the higher survivorship at Ngogo, but this cannot explain the much higher survivorship at Ngogo than at Kanyawara, another chimpanzee community in the same forest, which also lacks large carnivores. Higher survivorship at Ngogo appears to be an adaptive response to a food supply that is more abundant and varies less than that of Kanyawara. Future analyses of hominin life history evolution should take these results into account.

**Abstract:**

Cyanogenesis denotes a chemical defensive strategy where hydrogen cyanide (HCN, hydrocyanic or prussic acid) is produced, stored, and released toward an attacking enemy. The high toxicity and volatility of HCN requires both chemical stabilization for storage and prevention of accidental self-poisoning. The few known cyanogenic animals are exclusively mandibulate arthropods (certain myriapods and insects) that store HCN as cyanogenic glycosides, lipids, or cyanohydrins. Here, we show that cyanogenesis has also evolved in the speciose Chelicerata. The oribatid mite Oribatula tibialis uses the cyanogenic aromatic ester mandelonitrile hexanoate (MNH) for HCN storage, which degrades via two different pathways, both of which release HCN. MNH is emitted from exocrine opisthonotal oil glands, which are potent organs for chemical defense in most oribatid mites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is frequently confusion when deciding on the pluralization of animal names given scientists use both Greek and Latin. 

There is a similar issue with Octopus pluralization, which is *octopuses* not *octopi* if you want to be grammatically correct. Even *octopodes* is better than *octopi* because you are not mixing the Greek word *Octopus* with a Latin plural *Octopi*. The English plural is *Octopuses* and the Greek plural is *Octopodes*.
