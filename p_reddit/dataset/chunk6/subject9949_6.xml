	<TEXT> Did you ever read the study you posted?  You claim above that

New studies have shown that the ice caps are not melting

Yet the NASA study you posted says this: 

If the losses of the Antarctic Peninsula and parts of West Antarctica continue to increase at the same rate theyve been increasing for the last two decades, the losses will catch up with the long-term gain in East Antarctica in 20 or 30 years -- I dont think there will be enough snowfall increase to offset these losses.

and this:

the ice losses from the coastal regions of West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula increased by 65 billion tons per year (between 1992 - 2008).

The study does say that since the last ice age the ice cap has "thickened" due to increased snow fall but is clear that over the past several decades the coastal regions have shown tremendous deterioration and that the melting coasts will soon offset whatever gains were made by the increased snowfall.  

The study you posted actually proves the opposite of the point you are trying to make.  Care to try again?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Any public gathering over a particular size requires permits. Can effectively control the time/place/size of a protest, or stop it entirely by denying the permit. No permit means that protesters can be arrested for an unlawful gathering.
 Laws regarding blocking traffic are another method. Any disruption to traffic flow is an arrestable offense. No blocking roads, no marches. Even crossing the street in a group can be interpreted as "blocking traffic", allowing cops to arrest people on their way to a peaceful and legal protest. Worded properly, even causing traffic to slow down because they're reading your signs or exercising caution near a pedestrian crowd could be an offense.

This is how you get violent rebellion.  </TEXT>
