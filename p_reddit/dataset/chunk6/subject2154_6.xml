some people takes sports way to serious.  one of my closest friends went to Wisconsin but we are both from the same home town in Illinois and both love the Cubs.  We have a lot of fun with the rivalry.

All us good folks, like yourself, can do is be good diplomats for our cities and represent our Universities in good light. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are good fans and bad fans and I have no doubt there were some assholes on our end that deserved some ribbing but I know of a 10 year old and a 14 year old that went with their family to the game and got beer dumped on them, spit on and cursed at.  If you feel that all those excuses you listed above made this justifiable then we have a different meaning of friendly rivalry.  

You wanted our opinion and I shared experiences that were related to me.  If you came into Lincoln and acted like a punk, I'd still be nice and treat you kindly, I guess I'm a bit different then some.  Best of luck in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had several, completely unrelated, groups of friends go to the football game in Madison.  Based upon their experiences, which is summed up pretty well by F.L.A.D. on here, I'd never go to a game in Madison...which should be of great concern to you, your fans and your school.  

I'm from VERY northern Illinois so I feel a connection to Wisconsin, spent a lot of time as a kid fishing up there, vacations, etc.  It's a beautiful state that I love traveling through.  However, I have been less than thrilled with the treatment that our fans received.  It wasn't one guy yelling, F-OFF, which will happen, it was an endless parade of assholes which is unfortunate.  Pretty miserable experience, basically chased out of town is how one friend described it.

Joining the Big 10, I was more concerned with visiting Columbus but I've heard nothing but good things and if the chance presents itself, that is an away destination I would choose.  Definitely not Madison which is unfortunate in my opinion.

I guess living in Lincoln for the last 20 years, I find we go out of our way to make a visiting fan feel welcome and comfortable.  I often purchase returned visiting team tickets (football) and have an awesome time with the visiting fans.  I want you to come back to Lincoln, I want you to be a rival but not an enemy.  I know it probably seems silly from the outside but I take pride in stopping and welcoming a fan to my city, buying them a beer, welcoming them to a tailgate.  I love Lincoln, its a great place.  

But that is all football, the vibe from basketball seems a little more friendly overall in the B1G...but in the end, ignore internet trolls.  Its one thing for a fan to call you names online, its another for fans to throw beer on you while you try and escape to your car after a game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure what all will be needed but I will give a quick run down of things I have done or have experience with.  I'm happy to help in any capacity, be it streaming, video editing, graphics, website/forum/tech help or PR.

* In the olden days, I was an early member of an indie game company (2001-2003).  I was a level designer but also did a lot of community management type stuff.  Moderated forums, did the posts to our website and sent out news items to various gaming news sites, etc.  Public relations type work.

* Also in those olden days, I wrote for a now defunct gaming news site and did a lot of the graphics, reviews, interviews, articles, etc.

*  I have experience with graphic editing and design.  I also originally wanted to work in TV/Film so I do have a lot of experience with video editing, albeit I'm a bit rusty it is something I was once quite good at.  I feel it is something I have a good eye for.

*  I am currently a systems engineer by trade.  I have a lot of various IT skills, knowledge and experience.  I've been doing that for approx 14 years now.

Anyways, let me know what you need a hand with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey PvtHopscotch.  I too live out on the NW corner of town.  I am a PC gamer as well and can think of just 2 other people I personally know that do as well so I am right there with ya.

I play just about anything but right now I'm spending a lot of time on CS:GO for some reason.  I have 195 games in my steam library so I do play quite a variety of games.  I am looking forward to Titanfall and I just joined up with the Reddit Titanfall clan.

I also have Starcraft 2, Diablo 2, blah blah blah.  I've been playing PC games for longer than I care to admit so chances are I own it or would be interested in owning it.

I also started collecting arcade machines recently.  I have a Double Dragon which works perfect, an outrun that needs some TLC and I built a 4 player mame machine last fall which is here in my home office.

In any event, if you want to add me to your Steam list I'd be interesting in playing something, anything with most folks.  My Steam name is FREAKHEAD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome to Lincoln!  It's an incredible city that my wife and I truly love to live in.  I've lived in Chicago and spent a summer in Boston.  I've traveled all over the place and things are "just right" here.  Not to say there aren't a dozen other wonderful places to live but you'll find it's a nice fit for most people.


You'll find a very wide variety of food, arts, music and many other events.  


Here are a few things I'd recommend checking out as a new resident.

* [First Friday Artwalk](http://downtownlincoln.org/firstfriday).
* [Our wonderful trails](http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/parks/parksfacilities/trails/).
* [The Farmers Market](http://lincolnhaymarket.org/events/farmers-market/) (Begins May 4th).
* [The Coffee House](https://plus.google.com/116359938789557950949/about?gl=us hl=en).
* [The Zoo Bar](http://www.zoobar.com/).
* [Yia Yia's Pizza](http://yiayiaspizza.com/).

I'm sure everyone here can offer recommendations.  Just a few things to look for to eat, drink or socialize.  Best of luck and again, welcome to our city! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As an original KS backer, I was pretty excited for this game.  I wasn't too bothered about the delays as it tends to happen with first time developers.  I was more annoyed they hadn't communicated it well enough but I never said anything.

Three months ago, I went from supporter to angered community member.  The newly hired "community manager" AKA someone who has the people skills of a tree stump, became the MOD over at /castlestory and then started banning people who expressed their frustration with the pace of development, lack of communication and the nonexistent merchandise some were to receive for backing them through KS. 

 
* [Response to BAN Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/1qb95g/on_the_topic_of_a_couple_recent_bans/)
* [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/1qkh96/response_to_the_nightmare_weekend/) was a follow up of some sort, where I think they half apologized and but sounded like assholes.  They have removed the text so I am not sure what it was anymore.

They are no longer mods thankfully.  They still make smarmy response to critical posts but at least they can't ban people.  The community manager is just plan awful at handling criticism.  He took someone, like me, who was mostly indifferent to the delays and turned me into someone who can't recommend it.

If you are going to spend money on an Indie game, give it to a team that cares and may actually give you a product in the end.  If you think you'd want this game, at the very least wait until they learn how to make one.

edit...I accidentally a few words.

This is really disappointing, but I guess they need to clear room for another hour of America's Funniest Home Videos. :\ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my favorite Cubs story and I do apologize if some of the facts are fuzzy, it was ages ago.

I had moved away from IL in 84, but spent a lot of time back there as I was growing up.  In June of 1990 I was staying with my Grandparents for a month and my Uncle got us tickets to see the Cubs.  They were playing the Mets at home.  I believe it was 6/12 b/c I feel confident that Gooden pitched but 23 years later, who knows, it could have been the day game on 6/13.  I have the ticket but its stored away and I haven't looked at it for a while.

We went really early so I could watch the players warm up and seeing some of the those legendary players up close (for both teams), it was incredible!

Strangely enough, we also saw Marlee Matlin too, who had just won an oscar a few years before.  She was dating a Mets player at the time.  I had no idea who she was, my uncle pointed her out.  

Shortly there after, my Uncle shouted to me and I turned around to see Harry Caray heading my way.  WGN was my life line after moving away and spent a ridiculous amount of time watching games during those first few summers away from "home".  I loved Harry!  I ran up to him and asked him for his autograph.  He seemed slightly annoyed and said he was really busy, but he'd give me one on the way back.  He then proceeded to head down to the dugout and disappear.  

If memory serves, I believe he was checking on the status of Mitch Williams.  I loved watching that man pitch as a kid and I think that was the point where he got injured and didn't pitch much again for the Cubs, if at all.  I just can't remember now...anyways...

So he later emerged from the dug out and I knew this was my chance.  As he came back past me I asked if I could get his autograph now...he again said he was just too busy, and I replied, "but Harry, you promised..."  Apparently my heartbroken look got to him, he smiled and took my ticket and signed it.  It said "Holy Cow, Harry Caray" and to a young kid who lived and breathed baseball (and idolized the Cubs), it was like winning the lottery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On one of post game threads, someone from TAM was arguing that T-Mart played in the game!  We had our 4 year starter and Georgia didn't.  LOL...

At least Georgia had their starter for nearly the whole season.  He is a really special QB who got overlooked too often.  T-Mart was controversial at times but deserved a better send off than he got.

In the end, you play with who you got.  Freshmen, injured, whatever...shoulda/coulda/woulda is a cop out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> just to add to this point he was indeed a big actor who was coming back from a very low point in his life.  He's been in a gazillion movies and was nominated for an Oscar for this performance in Chaplin in 1992.

Then, things spiraled out of control and to be honest, I assume he would die from a heroin over dose at some point.  Iron Man rescued his career and I'm glad b/c I enjoy watching him onscreen, no matter the role.

	<TEXT> Its ok to be disappointed but let's put things in perspective.  I wish these boohoo threads would stop.

edit:  you can downvote me then I guess, but let's be realistic, there are folks much worse off than us.  I have a friend who just got a bonemarrow transplant a few days ago, fighting cancer since August.  My aunt is being released from the hospital today who has had pneumonia.  This has required that she stop chemo treatments she needs to fight cancer.

There are also families like [this one](http://journalstar.com/news/local/i-m-asking-for-my-mom-and-family/article_cbba4447-1ed3-5ac0-a8a0-070d451eb7c2.html) I just read about today.  

I said its ok to be disappointed but just remember that things could be worse.

	<TEXT> Instead of having a pity party for ourselves, lets realize that ultimately, most of us are very lucky.  And certainly while disappointing, there are tens of millions of people, at least in here in the USA, who will feel they are having a wonderful Christmas/Holiday if they have a warm meal, a warm place to sleep or someone to spend the holiday with.  On top of that, there a untold millions fighting illness or overseas with the military.

This won't stop me from being in the Secret Santa at all.  I look forward to doing this every year, trying to get better at the "ultimate" gift, which to me isn't 29 PS3 games, although that sounds pretty sweet, but the exact gift they weren't looking for but now love.

If you are feeling frustrated, that's ok, but use that energy today to pass along a good deed and it will make you feel even better!  I also hope that each of you, if you wish, get rematched and that perfect gift finds its way to you.  

Happy Holidays! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nebraska here....can probably kick up at least 6 or 7 runners, certainly we could engage the local run club here in Lincoln and in Omaha and cover the state.

I'd support any number of causes, the Rebel Alliance, Save the Clock Tower but in all seriousness, an important cause in our neck of the woods is Pediatric Brain Cancer Research via [The Team Jack Foundation](http://www.teamjackfoundation.org/).  

**edit**

Also, I'm originally from Illinois with a lot of friends and family still there.  I could also run additional stretches across either state, potentially, if we have gaps OR I could maybe find a few friends who would as well. </TEXT>
