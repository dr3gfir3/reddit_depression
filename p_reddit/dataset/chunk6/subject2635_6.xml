	<TEXT> Maybe it will be used here, and maybe not. We can't really speculate. But the point is that the act would apply here and the US could ~~decide to~~ prosecute if they decide to do so. That, and it answers the original question that it IS illegal based on the specific circumstances surrounding the incident. And the act has been previously applied on a military base in Germany. In that case, it was a murder case and Germany wouldn't prosecute it the way the US would (specifically, Germany wouldn't consider the death penalty). 

As far as I know, the question still hasn't been definitively answered if the film would be considered child pornography in Germany. If it's not, then the question of citizenship becomes very relevant as to whether or not he can be prosecuted.

I would be a little bit surprised if German decides to take legal action against a US citizen who committed a crime against another US citizen when a US legal presence is close by and arguably has jurisdiction (according to the text of the act). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From [another article](http://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/bud-kennedy/article52749215.html)

"Back in July 2014, father and Lakeside sheet metal magnate Fred Couch had his own laugh. According to North Richland Hills police, he claimed to be a law officer.

At 1:15 a.m. on a Monday, according to the police report, officers interviewed Couch at a disturbance call and he identified himself as a Lakeside city reserve officer. He even said, I have my Lakeside police stuff in the truck.

Lakeside police say Fred Couchs badge was an ID for volunteers with a search-and-rescue unit.

One of the real officers had worked in Lakeside and knew better. But Couch produced a badge and credentials that looked official, police said.

Turns out Couch was never an officer, Lakeside Police Chief Lee Pitts said the other day. His credentials were for a long-ago Lakeside volunteer search-and-rescue team.

At some point years ago  nobody even remembers  they had this unit, all volunteers, said Pitts, the chief for nine years.

But they were never certified as peace officers. Nobody ever meant it that way." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Princess Bride-opoly looks pretty cool. And even better that you tweaked the rules a little bit to stick with the theme. 

If you don't mind me asking, how did you get the license to make games based on Firefly? I write, and had asked fox about a license for novels based on the 'verse (out of curiosity more than anything), but they shut down that conversation down pretty quickly. Of course, I'm just a small fry, so that could have had something to do with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But, in this case, the question isn't about age of consent. The question is whether filming the sex act was itself creating (and later distributing) child pornography. 

[Per 18 U.S. Code  3267](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3267), the [Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Extraterritorial_Jurisdiction_Act) applies to dependents of US service-members when deployed overseas. Under this act, a US citizen in a foreign country may be prosecuted "for any offense that would be punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States."

Twelve people have been prosecuted under this act, all for violating US law while working overseas. 

For that reason, citizenship is very relevant because it means that the act would apply to him.  </TEXT>

Relevant to this case, it looks like the act was also [applied to a US contractor working in Baghdad](http://www.dodig.mil/iginformation/iginformationreleases/U%20S%20Attorneys'%20Office%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Virginia%20Press%20Release.pdf) for possessing child pornography.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a lawyer. 

It sounds like the person that did the filming is a US citizen, if he went to the same school as OP (if OP would be so kind as to clarify). OP goes to a department of defense school overseas, which provides education to dependents of US military members and DoD civilians. Given this, it's most likely that the filmer is a US citizen. 

If that's the case, then 18 U.S.C.  2251(c) would apply. It says, in part:

Any person who, in a circumstance described in paragraph (2), employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, or who has a minor assist any other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct outside of the United States, its territories or possessions, for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished as provided under subsection (e).

section 2 clarifies: 

(A) the person intends such visual depiction to be transported to the United States, its territories or possessions, by any means, including by using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or mail; or
(B) the person transports such visual depiction to the United States, its territories or possessions, by any means, including by using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or mail.

Snapchat is a US-based company, with terms of service that specify the choice of law as being in California. Assuming that their servers are also in the US, then the sexual explicit visuals depicting a minor were transmitted to the US. 

18 U.S. Code  2260 may also apply. 

If the two teenagers that had sex were also US citizens, it might be possible that they violated 18 U.S. Code  2423:

Any United States citizen or alien admitted for permanent residence who travels in foreign commerce or resides, either temporarily or permanently, in a foreign country, and engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.

and clarifies that illegal sexual conduct is "a sexual act (as defined in section 2246) with a person under 18 years of age that would be in violation of chapter 109A if the sexual act occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States". 

As far as I understand it, the [Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Extraterritorial_Jurisdiction_Act) applies to family members of military personnel accompanying the service-member on deployment "for any offense that would be punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States." In this case, I believe distribution of child pornography would apply.

	<TEXT> It is, but the girl (if I'm reading correctly) goes to a high school on a US military base, indicating that her parents are in the US military and likely US citizens (or at least subject to US law). If US law applies, given the nationality of the people involved, then filming it would be illegal.

Edit: OP is not specific, and would have to clarify if the girl is from his school (and likely a US citizen) or if it was from another school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally speaking, even 4chan removes child pornography when reported. 

Remember that the girl in the video went to high school on an American military base, meaning that she's a US citizen (or at least her parent(s) are members of the US armed forces). I'm not a lawyer, but I believe that means they're subject to US law. Under US law, this is child pornography.

edit: OP doesn't specify if the girl goes to his DoD school (and is likely a US citizen), or if she goes to another school. So right now it's hard to answer that part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Taking away a major revenue source would definitely harm the cartels, but at the other end of your example are people who believe that ending the war on drugs would destroy the cartels completely. 

The cartels are run very much like a business. They have resources that some fortune 500 CEOs would envy: massive amounts of money at their disposal, a huge workforce that is willing to do anything their told, a sophisticated logistics and distribution network in multiple countries and the legal top cover to make sure that they can pretty much do what they want to do. That allows them to pivot to different (ahem) "business" opportunities. 

First we have to assume that the cartels are keyed into our political and regulatory process. I'd bet that the cartels as a whole know more about our political processes than the average American does. So they'll be able to see the writing on the wall regarding drug laws at the federal and state level. This gives them time to react to changing legislation, if they're not (pure speculation) influencing the political process as well. 

The cartels will do whatever they can do to maintain their current level of control and profits. Maybe they'll eventually lose, but take drugs out of their wheelhouse (which won't happen entirely in our lifetimes, I believe), they're going to pursue other criminal enterprises. Already, Mexican criminal groups are making $42million annually with human trafficking, which is a drop in the bucket compared to their current income from drugs. But I believe that human trafficking is one of the many crimes that will increase as drug profits go down. 

One of the cartels has already [started to diversify](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/17/drug-cartels-iron-ore_n_4978564.html), and drugs are no longer their primary source of income. Their primary activity is illegal iron mining, which earns them up to $1.4 million a week from that crime. Now, I'd prefer that they're engaging in illegal mining to drug crimes and murder, but this is a good example of how the cartels will adjust their business model, just like any corporation. 

Taking away their drug revenue will be a good thing to hurt the cartels, but it won't destroy them alone. And it won't happen soon, either. And as their income is slowly reduced, they will get more desperate and more violent. I believe that we (being the non-cartel world that is affected by the cartels) need to act sooner than reducing drug income alone would allow. The cartels think they're fighting a war, and they're equipped and trained to be good at it. I believe that significant non-corrupted and intimidated police action or armed response is necessary to reduce their ability to operate and loosen their grip on towns and regions. This will take away their manufacturing and logistics capability, which is critical to their operations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prove it, how? I think we can all agree that the cartels were involved- as far as I know, no one is seriously doubting that part. If the cartels are involved, the police won't be digging too thoroughly. And Nereo Patio Delgado is missing, so there's really not too much room to investigate even if someone were willing to ~~be the next victim~~ take on the cartels in such a way.

It would be great if the police in Mexico bashed in some doors and brought the specific gunmen to justice. But that's not how things work in that region.  

Ask all the questions you want, but there's no one that can answer them. We can theorize all we want, but the only part that's clear is that she had powerful enemies that had a vested interest in seeing her killed. </TEXT>

The MSRP is $39.95, but the local game shop rounded up to an even $40.

They call the cards Gorram and Shiney cards. The effects of the cards are about the same as the original- you might go to jail, advance to to go, things like that. But I actually like the cards themselves. [Here's](http://usaopoly.com/sites/default/files/files/chance_1.png) what they look like.

I'm trying again with the warranty. It's going to be interesting because they said they wouldn't repair it because it was faucet related, but the manufacturer calls the part that's faulty a valve (which is specifically covered). I'm guessing that they use different definitions, which might cause a bit of conflict.

Thanks for the input! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And I think you hit the nail on the head. The actual threat depends on the level of organization involved. In the middle east, there are multiple competing groups of different sizes and level or organization. This complicates things for coalition forces, but also supports your point that the more organized groups are generally the more effective. Of course we have to acknowledge that small groups or 'lone wolves' can be effective to a degree, as we've seen in Paris, San Bernardino and other area. Sadly, domestic terrorism already exists. 

If a domestic insurgency can become organized, I think there would be a very real threat. Much like in the middle east and vietnam, it would be hard to tell friend from foe and guerrilla tactics would be extremely effective (even if only to prolong the conflict). If they are unable to organize and you have multiple small groups, I think it would be addressed (ultimately successfully) by law enforcement.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You raise some very good points, but I think you're assuming symmetric warfare in your assessment. The US military has very few peers when it comes to direct military confrontation- tanks against tanks, planes against planes, ships against ships. This is why its adversaries tend to prefer asymmetric warfare. 

Vietnam's a good example of this- the vietcong avoided direct confrontation, using guerrilla tactics to level the playing field. Same thing in Iraq or Afghanistan, which has been going on for years using similar strategies. 

If there was a small group of insurgents within the US, and they were easily located and identifiable, you're 100% correct. They wouldn't last long. The US war machine wouldn't even apply at that point, since it's domestic and would be covered under Title V of the US Code. 

If things got bad enough to warrant Title X (that is, regular military unit) involvement, then I don't think it would be as easy as you might be suggesting. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I moved into a new house about five months ago, and we've been having plumbing issues since day one. The home is four years old, and I think we're the second owners.

The builders forgot to cap a pipe in the ceiling, so it was leaking. While they had it open, they also found that there was a leak on the water main. Both of those were installation issues, so they fixed those.

We have been having problems with the master bathtub, and we tried to go through the home warranty to get it fixed. From what I can gather, the valves were installed incorrectly, causing a leak. The warranty won't repair it because it's faucet related, so I'm stuck there. I tried to go through the builders again, since it was installed incorrectly, but they said the warranty was good for two years after installation and that the previous owners should have taken care of it. 

Am I stuck paying out of pocket for getting it fixed? </TEXT>

Unfortunately, one of the unavoidable deciding factors is cost. The course of steriods is the most affordable, but I guess I didn't consider that it could actually contribute to making things worse. 

I guess I don't really need to know *what* it is, specifically. I just want her to be comfortable and happy. And I really don't want my son to lose his cat so close to Christmas. But her quality of life is the most important thing in this situation.

	<DATE> 2015-12-26 20:07:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My older cat, Fluffy (my son named her that because she's, well, Fluffy), started pawing at her mouth and doing this weird... Licking... Thing. Like she was having trouble swallowing.

I took her to the vet who thought he saw a mass on her tongue. $400 in tests later, he says that there is no sign of cancer elsewhere in her body, but her test results indicate that it might be eosinophilic granuloma complex. This is supported by the (not directly observed) mass on her tongue, but she doesn't seem to have sores anywhere else, and I haven't seen any indication of parasites.

So we're looking at sedation, more tests and maybe a biopsy and either exercision of the mass or a course of steroid treatments. But I'm not all that bright, and I don't really know what questions to ask or what to expect. Should the vet be able to confirm eosinophilic granuloma complex visually? We love her and don't want her to suffer, but we're really not sure what to expect (and the vet didn't want to make plans past Tuesday).

Either way, thanks for listening.

Update: The vet put her under and did a more thorough examination of her mouth. There he found symptoms that supported the eosinophilic granuloma complex theory. We started her on a course of steroids and she has a follow-up in two weeks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Out of context, I see where you're coming from. But recall that I was responding to a poster who found it worth mentioning that two people found an obscure sub on an obscure day (whatever that means). In my reply, I pointed out the different subs that linked here that have a combined ~10 million subscribers. I can see the confusion, so I'm glad we cleared that up. 

I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree about the plausibility of two people that have a personal connection to the shooting hearing about this AMA. 

/u/ragecry said:

You know what's funny? How two people in this obscure sub, on this obscure day, just happened to show up and know some victims of the Sandy Hook shooting!! Without giving any specific details either, just vague statements by anonymous users. How fucking convenient, their schedules must have synchronized with Dr. Fetzer's, for they were ready to chime in at just the right moment to stir up some hate, emotion and controversy.

He didn't use the word conspiracy, but his comment suggests that there was something behind the posts other than what was occurring on its face. If he's not suggesting a conspiracy ("a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful," in this case harmful to the message of OP), then it's very much off topic and inane. 

Anyways, I think we've run this particular topic into the ground :) Have a merry christmas, if you celebrate the holiday.  </TEXT>

But what if you could give a direct link with an engaging title up to 10 million redditors? Doesn't it stand to reason that some of those 10 million would check it out?

That's what happened here. This sub is not very popular, but when it was linked in some of the very popular subreddits, it got a lot of attention. /r/IAMA alone has 9.9 million subscribers, so posting a link to this discussion in that sub is going to generate some more traffic. 

It's like having a local business in the mall. You might get some walk-in traffic, but no one knows you're there. But if you put a commercial on a national television network, you'd definitely get more traffic.

You can see more children in a different area [here](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HOqIRQNOJgU/U8xI5pWLyGI/AAAAAAAAA60/I3NI4rQqbuc/s1600/0%5B1%5D.jpg). [Here's](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z55N99EX63w/U8xLBDrWGMI/AAAAAAAAA7k/SoT6mG_easU/s1600/evac9.png) some others. 

That's also assuming that all of the children were evacuated at the same time. That may or may not be true, I don't know. But there are different protocols depending on where the shooter is. Some may do what's called 'shelter in place,' which means staying in a safe location until the scene is secured. Others, those that may be in more immediate danger, may be evacuated immediately. 

You can compare this to Columbine. There are 1700 students at columbine. I've never seen a picture or combination of pictures showing 1700 students. Do you believe Columbine was a false flag operation for the same reason?

But, more to the point, how many thousands and thousands of people would have to be in on this hoax? We're talking about the schools that would have had to fake degrees for the adults. We're talking about friends and family members of the crisis actors who would recognize their loved ones on television. We're talking about people that would have recognized the children that were involved (and the children who would have to be trusted to keep that secret). We're talking the medical staff and examiners. We're talking law enforcement. We're talking the people that claim to have known the victims from areas outside of town. How is it that all those thousands of people have managed to keep such a secret for so long? </TEXT>

The killer was... [the mother!](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/07/moms-day-anna-jarvis-lauri-taylor-column/24662917/). Yes, it was suicide. No wonder Ms. Taylor wanted to keep that a secret.  </TEXT>

This is the same thing that you see with antivaxxers or holocaust deniers. Sure, they deserve a voice, too, but we shouldn't be surprised when people express their displeasure with downvotes.

Dr. Fetzer had an unpopular view that was poorly presented. The downvotes shouldn't be surprising. All the same, he was technically adding to the discussion, which should be upvoted (or ignored, depending on one's preference). </TEXT>

So your position is that the many, many people that would have to be silent on this matter can be trusted to remain silent because they've been paid? Is there any evidence that the families and friends of the alleged victim and other adults depicted in the news (and those that would see them in another environment) have also been paid off? How can the government address the actions of so many people that weren't involved in the original act?

Follow-up question: do you believe this conspiracy was classified? If so, do you believe that the actors received a government security clearance? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dr. Fetzer, in order for such a deception to be successful, a lot of people would have to be in on the conspiracy. The actors, their families, law enforcement, investigators, photographers, children, morturary and hospital staff, etc. 

They would have to commit to this for the rest of their lives, and the victims could never show themselves in public. Actors would have to explain their appearance on national, 24/7 news to friends, colleagues and family members- I have a hard time imagining a cover story that would stand up to all that scrutiny. And of course there's the alleged perpetrator and his family, who would also have to be prepared to keep this secret for a lifetime (and in the case of the shooter, try to avoid recognition). This would all be done without granting security clearances and relying only on non-disclosure agreements. 

How do you suggest that so many people have been able to support a conspiracy for so long? Or has anyone admitted to being a part of it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You really never know until you're in a life or death situation. I spent some time in Iraq, and everybody seemed to have a plan for when they arrived. There were some that were planning out their heroics and drooling about all the medals they'd earn. There were others that were terrified and admitted (privately) that they were afraid they were going to run at the first sign of violence. 

The thing is, there really wasn't any correlation between what people planned and what they actually did when there were bits of metal headed our way. In that moment, all of the bravado and fears were stripped away and people showed what they really were. Some of the cowards were heroic. Some of of the Rambos ended up wetting themselves. 

War's funny that way. 

So you might not actually be a pussy afterall. And hopefully you'll never have to find out for sure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But what if we did? What if a very wealthy man gave a small portion of their wealth to a good cause, and we celebrated and praised them for it. It would probably feel good to receive such praise (in most cases), which would increase the likelihood of them doing it again. Maybe that's not pure motives in that specific case, but it's still a win for the world. 

And other wealthy celebrities see what their peer is doing and the response that it gets. Maybe they want that as well. Maybe they think about it and decide it's a good thing to do. Maybe they want the free press that comes with good deeds. Whatever the case, it's still a net win for the world. 

Honestly, I think we should be focusing on the kindness that happens every day. The media focuses on the bad stuff that happens (and there's a lot of that), and I really think that colors our perceptions of the world around us. I'd much rather have people doing good things because it's the right thing to do, but I'll still be happy when kids get their surgeries.  </TEXT>
