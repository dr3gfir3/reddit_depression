	<TEXT> In the corporate world there is a thing called Due Diligence and Governance. Agree calling HR general line is a dumb idea. Ethics hotlines, even if they are under HR, are a different story. Banking is a regulated activity. A bank's charter to operate is contingent on them operating on a lawful basis, and to have actual processes to seriously investigate reports of illegal activity in the bank. Of course this is all a crock of shit. It's the too big to fail principle at work again. Everyone keeps saying why doesn't Stumpf resign. But that's not the right question. The right question is why hasn't the DoJ charged Wells-Fargo with criminal fraud. People have said - what good will that do? the bank can't go to jail. No they can't, but they can lose their charter to operate as bank. They can be liquidated and sold off in parts to other banks. Every one says this should have happened in the 2008 financial melt down. In this case, the bank, and its management should have been on their toes for complete ethical compliance. Given that this is a second offense, the bank should get the death penalty.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These are recently discovered (in the last 20 years or so) lightning phenomenon that are extremely short lived.  The physics of sprites (and an associated phenomenon called "Elves") is not completely understood but it is believed to be caused when the electrical charge on the top of thunder cloud discharges up into the ionosphere rather than to another cloud (cloud-to-cloud) or with the ground (cloud-to-ground) of ordinary lightning discharges. They are extremely short lived and so require very high speed cameras to catch. They happen so fast they're near the limit of human perception of detection </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Outside the USA, beef, especially burger, tastes different, "gamey" is how I'd describe it similar to what I've tasted in my neighbor's venison burgers. I've heard this attributed to different butchering standards in other countries, including a less thorough draining of the blood from the carcass than in the US. Admittedly, my sample size is relatively small and it doesn't apply to all non-USA countries:  
Burgers taste like USA: Canada, Chile, Netherlands.  
Burgers taste like the cow was hunted and butchered in the woods: France, South Africa   Australia  
EDIT --  
UK burgers taste funny too - not quite to the level of Oz and SA, but maybe a little CJV spice

	<TEXT> Considering how much China is building up their military and planning to be a "global power", have to wonder how they've concluded China's weapons count has remained in the 200s of so long. Back in the cold war we watched every nuclear reactor in the world, modeled how much plutonium was generated in each run, noted when the old fuel was unloaded/reloaded, etc. In an age when reactors and processing plants can be hidden inside of mountains, not really sure you can still use the same methods, or if it has the same attention it used to. An analysis group at Georgetown University concluded that China has way more ICBMs than they've declared (they keep theirs in tunnels inside mountains) based on some observed pattern of activity and number of holes. The "experts" all poo poo'ed their conclusions, but their analysis seemed to hold. If their missile count is as high as estimated, their nuclear weapons count would be up in the 1500 to 2000 range, and perhaps higher.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The galactic orbital speed of stars in galaxies would drop off with distance from the center of the galaxy if the dark matter distribution matched the mass distribution that we see from visible matter --e.g. stars and dust clouds. Another analogy is the orbital speeds of the planets around the Sun: Mercury orbits extremely quickly because it is close to the concentrated mass of the sun in the solar system. Each planet further out from the sun orbits correspondingly more slowly, because 99% of the solar system's mass is in the sun. The stars in galaxies don't follow this pattern. Instead they're all orbiting pretty close to the same speed regardless of their distance from the center. There is some variation with distance but not nearly what you'd expect to see from mass concentrations of visible matter. This is how Dark Matter was discovered. The only way to explain the velocity distribution of stars in galaxies is if the visible disc of the galaxy is itself embedded in a globular sphere of mass. It isn't necessarily a perfect sphere, but it must have its mass distributed semi uniformly across the volume -- ie not concentrated in a disk that trails off at the edges.  </TEXT>

There's no proof any of what you're seeing is anything other than normal variation.  

Now these events are happening every few weeks. One might very well argue that conservative media who have been the mainstay of climate change denial are giving short shrift to the coverage because the event itself is a "told you so asshole" repudiation of their earlier positions </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saw it on a science cast last night. The earth's orbital velocity is 43km/sec. To hit the sun you have to expend delta v of 43km/sec  to reverse your orbital speed so solar gravity will make you fall into the sun. Miscalculate only the slightest bit and you'll miss the sun and take an elliptical path past the sun. Delta v to achieve escape velocity from the solar system on the other hand is only 11 km/sec from the earth. You need 7 km/sec to break out of earth's gravity and just another 4 km/sec to escape the sun. Of course you're starting with 43 km/sec from the earth's speed, so the delta is only 4 km/sec more added on to it </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  similar to photons, which are the carriers of the electromagnetic force   


So how exactly do photons "carry" electromagnetic force? We usually think and hear of photons being a quantum of light/energy that is picked up by a detector or causes an electron to be kicked into a higher energy orbital; but if I push the poles of two magnets together and feel them pull together or push apart, where are the photons? It's not like there is a laser shooting between those magnets. Similarly if I rub a ballon on my shirt and stick it on the wall with static electricity, where are the photons that are causing the force causing it to stick? What frequency are they vibrating? Are they radio, millimeter, infrared, UV, Xray or gamma? Somebody's got a lot of explaining to do

The chemicals condense on the polar ice clouds, but are not active until they are activate by the return of sunlight in the late winter/early spring. The clouds act as traps, gathering the chemicals into high concentrations. Then, when the sun strikes the cloud, they are all photochemically activated and released into the atmosphere in a large pulse that catalytically reacts with ozone, although at that point, no longer on the surface of the ice crystals  </TEXT>

I don't think they guys were so much saying "sure, show us your tits" as they were countering her position that they shouldn't be allowed to take off their shirts if she couldn't take off hers. I think technically they were all supposed to remain in uniform, but it had been custom going back more than a generation that mechanics working in the tropical heat could very well work on planes sitting in the sun bare chested. Clearly applying that custom to women, only recently integrated into this aspect of the military, would violate societal taboos. Basically the woman was saying, if there is a societal taboo against me going topless, none of you should be able to. Their response was "hey, it's technically against regs for any of us to strip down, do what you're comfortable doing".

	<TEXT> To be specific, it is because the chemistry that depletes the ozone occurs on the surfaces of tiny ice crystals that only form in high enough concentrations at the altitude of the ozone layer during the late winter and early spring at the center of the polar vortex. In areas outside the center of the vortex the ice crystal are dispersed by the winds of the vortex, but in the center of the gyre, they tend to concentrate and form clouds. The ice crystals serve as a base on which ~~hydrofluorocarbon~~ Chlorofluorocarbon compounds condense and begin acting as a catalyst for the ozone depletion reaction. In effect, it forms a giant catalytic converter hundreds of miles wide, chewing up all the ozone that comes near it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is an effect on the ISS due to gravity gradient that does not apply on the ground or in "the middle of space". Due to the gradient in the gravity field over two points different distances from the center of earth's mass, the two points will have different orbital velocities, or more correctly, their natural velocities will be different. If the two points are connected in a single structure, like the ISS, the entire structure will orbit at the natural velocity at the altitude of its center of mass. But... Objects inside the structure at the extremes of distance from the center will still want to orbit at their natural velocities, with those lower to ground wanting to go faster and those furthest from the ground wanting to go slower. As a result, things in the ISS will tend to "fall" toward the center of mass of the ISS. The force acting on those objects is called "tides" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The typical police response that gets them off the hook is their monotone "I was in fear for my life". Often it is complete bullshit, but it suggests to me police are being trained to be fearful of a violent encounters for situations that are far rarer "in real police life" than their training would suggest. I was recently viewing articles published in "Police" magazine talking about how dangerous a traffic stop is for a cop, and the potential for them to be killed or injured. Checking the FBI statistics for law enforcement officer killing over the past 10 years, the numbers of LEOs killed on the job was fairly low, and until this year, declining. Of 54 officers killed in the line of duty in 2011 (from memory, so I could be off by a year or two), 4 were killed in a traffic stop, 2 of those were after high speed chases. Yet, the police training is suggesting this is very common/dangerous way to get killed on the job. It's like the parents that obsess over their kids getting abducted. In that case, they were doing shit like putting identity tags in false teeth and tattooing identifying marks on kids "just in case" they were abducted. In the case of police, they're drawing guns and one a hair trigger because they've been primed "black people are criminals who are going to kill you for no reason". These shootings are happening for a reason, and the reason is police training, that and a lot of implicit racism. When cops say "We're afraid too", you have to question - well why are you afraid? Isn't your fear unjustified in most cases? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Flying 530 am flight Houston thru Dallas after a night of margaritas and heavy duty jalapeo queso, I realize "man, I've got a shitstorm brewing". Land in Dallas and it's the Friday morning rush. Restrooms are packed. I mean cheek to flapping jowl, 3 deep waiting for a stall. My cheeks are clenched tighter than Fort Knox, knowing what's coming. Finally getting into the stall, the storm breaks with a massive microburst, burning everything it touches. Wipe, wipe then guts gurgle and another burning drip. Spatter, wipe repeat. Finally the end seems in sight. I become aware the bowl below me is so full of paper, it's almost touching my ass. Suddenly, the auto flush triggers. The wad of paper goes down and then clogs. The fluid level starts rising. What do I do? Should I shout out a warning? Time is of the essence. I grab my pants up, buckle my belt, snatch my computer bag and bolt out the door just as the sewage starts pouring over the edge of the bowl. Dashing into the dense crowd I hope no one can ID me as the perp. Behind me the doors of the two adjacent stalls burst open. A guy with his pants around his knees is hopping out dragging his bag. On the other side, a guy leaps out with toilet paper streamers hanging from his ass, leap frogging out of his stall. The crowd outside is still cheek to jowl. He falls over into crowd. People go down like bowling pins. I hear screams behind me over the sound of water pouring on the tiles. Run, don't look back.  </TEXT>
