	<TEXT> I'm really questioning whether Russia kept some sarin in reserve to redeploy to Syria just to goat Trump into attacking, thus calling off their air safety agreement, thus causing a conflict.

	<TEXT> Playing into Putin's hands nicely. If Russia collected and destroyed all the sarin in Syria, it's most likely that they would have had the sarin to use against civilians. It's not beyond Russia to give some to syria to use. It would also goad Trump into attacking. Now Putin can finally get into the war he wanted. After all, his oil stocks were plummeting. </TEXT>
