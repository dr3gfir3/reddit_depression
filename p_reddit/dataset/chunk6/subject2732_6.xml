	<TEXT> I love Archie. It's sad to see the hate he's been getting over his confused love life. Every Riverdale video on YouTube has lots of people commenting about how he's a fuckboy and is the worst character in the show. I think his character in the show is a great portrayal of the comic book character.
Loved how he was there for Jughead and Veronica in their times of need. Also hope that we'll get more Archie and Betty moments in the future. They kind of dried out after ArchieRonnie and Bughead happened. :( 
Looking forward to more character development for Archie in the future seasons. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think so too. Someone earlier pointed out that one of Lee Toland Krieger's Instagram posts gave it away. The post said that KJ and Mads are the ones who got the worst of shooting on a frozen lake.

Hoping against hope that Archie's valiant attempt to save Cheryl does not go in vain. We need Cheryl to last for the future seasons. :( </TEXT>
