	<TEXT> It absolutely does^[1](http://sealevelstudy.org/sea-change-science/whats-in-a-number/attractive-ice-sheets), ^[2](http://harvardmagazine.com/2010/05/gravity-of-glacial-melt) . Plenty of papers out there on the subject too if you care to look.

If you were to put a strawberry on top of that vanilla wafer, the added weight would make the cookie sink into the pudding. In the same way, heavy weights on Earth's crust push it down into the mantle, which flows away and bulges out elsewhere. The miles-thick ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have been depressing the crust beneath them for millennia. That weight has a second effect that you won't see in your dessert: its gravitational pull on the surrounding ocean makes seawater pile up around the coastlines... 

Scientists currently believe ice sheet fingerprints will be the major driver of future regional variations in sea levels. - [NASA](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4701)

EDIT: The open access paper [The sea level fingerprint of recent ice mass fluxes](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/4/621/2010/) provides excellent detail on relative sea-level resulting from gravitational effects of ice loss including numerous figures.

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Consistent negative response of US crops to high temperatures in observations and crop models](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13931)
___

**Abstract**

High temperatures are detrimental to crop yields and could lead to global warming-driven reductions in agricultural productivity. To assess future threats, the majority of studies used process-based crop models, but their ability to represent effects of high temperature has been questioned. Here we show that an ensemble of nine crop models reproduces the observed average temperature responses of US maize, soybean and wheat yields. Each day 30C diminishes maize and soybean yields by up to 6% under rainfed conditions. Declines observed in irrigated areas, or simulated assuming full irrigation, are weak. This supports the hypothesis that water stress induced by high temperatures causes the decline. For wheat a negative response to high temperature is neither observed nor simulated under historical conditions, since critical temperatures are rarely exceeded during the growing season. In the future, yields are modelled to decline for all three crops at temperatures 30C. Elevated CO2 can only weakly reduce these yield losses, in contrast to irrigation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's interesting because of the disparity in sea level vs surface temperature then and now.

It takes time for the system to respond^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_inertia), ^[2](http://oceans.mit.edu/news/featured-stories/short-lived-greenhouse-gases-cause-centuries-of-sea-level-rise) . The rise in temperature during the last interglacial, dictated initially by insulation^[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) , occurred over thousands of years. Increases in sea surface temperatures also took thousands of years (relevant portion of [Figure 1](http://i.imgur.com/d1ZwoDu.jpg)), grossly speaking. The take home message is just how sensitive these ice sheets are to warming temperatures. Anthropogenic global warming is occurring over *vastly* shorter time scales... we're just waiting for the rest of the system to catch up. </TEXT>

Rather it looks, in detail, at Sea Surface Temperature (SST) during the LIG and uses a coupled climate model to replicate proxy-based sea-surface temperature stacks over the duration of the LIG stating the following:

	<TEXT> Study: [Regional and global sea-surface temperatures during the last interglaciation](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6322/276)
___

**Significance**

Understanding how warm intervals affected sea level in the past is vital for projecting how human activities will affect it in the future. Hoffman et al. compiled estimates of sea surface temperatures during the last interglacial period, which lasted from about 129,000 to 116,000 years ago. The global mean annual values were 0.5C warmer than they were 150 years ago and indistinguishable from the 19952014 mean. This is a sobering point, because sea levels during the last interglacial period were 6 to 9 m higher than they are now.

**Abstract**

The last interglaciation (LIG, 129 to 116 thousand years ago) was the most recent time in Earths history when global mean sea level was substantially higher than it is at present. However, reconstructions of LIG global temperature remain uncertain, with estimates ranging from no significant difference to nearly 2C warmer than present-day temperatures. Here we use a network of sea-surface temperature (SST) records to reconstruct spatiotemporal variability in regional and global SSTs during the LIG. Our results indicate that peak LIG global mean annual SSTs were 0.5  0.3C warmer than the climatological mean from 1870 to 1889 and indistinguishable from the 1995 to 2014 mean. LIG warming in the extratropical latitudes occurred in response to boreal insolation and the bipolar seesaw, whereas tropical SSTs were slightly cooler than the 1870 to 1889 mean in response to reduced mean annual insolation. </TEXT>

Furthermore, in more recent geological periods the two are clearly anti-correlated, while also showing anti-correlation over Earth's entire geologic history.

Some plants may benefit from higher atmospheric CO2, other limiting factors not included, but that's about it. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

During the Green Sahara period (11,000 to 5000 years before the present), the Sahara desert received high amounts of rainfall, supporting diverse vegetation, permanent lakes, and human populations. Our knowledge of rainfall rates and the spatiotemporal extent of wet conditions has suffered from a lack of continuous sedimentary records. We present a quantitative reconstruction of western Saharan precipitation derived from leaf wax isotopes in marine sediments. Our data indicate that the Green Sahara extended to 31N and likely ended abruptly. We find evidence for a prolonged pause in Green Sahara conditions 8000 years ago, coincident with a temporary abandonment of occupational sites by Neolithic humans. The rainfall rates inferred from our data are best explained by strong vegetation and dust feedbacks; without these mechanisms, climate models systematically fail to reproduce the Green Sahara. This study suggests that accurate simulations of future climate change in the Sahara and Sahel will require improvements in our ability to simulate vegetation and dust feedbacks.

**Abstract**

Modern-day periodic climate pattern variations related to solar activity are well known. High-resolution records such as varves, ice cores, and tree-ring sequences are commonly used for reconstructing climatic variations in the younger geological history. For the first time we apply dendrochronological methods to Paleozoic trees in order to recognize annual variations. Large woody tree trunks from the early Permian Fossil Forest of Chemnitz, southeast Germany, show a regular cyclicity in tree-ring formation. The mean ring curve reveals a 10.62 yr cyclicity, the duration of which is almost identical to the modern 11 yr solar cycle. Therefore, we speculate and further discuss that, like today, sunspot activity caused fluctuations of cosmic radiation input to the atmosphere, affecting cloud formation and annual rates of precipitation, which are reflected in the tree-ring archive. This is the earliest record of sunspot cyclicity and simultaneously demonstrates its long-term stable periodicity for at least 300 m.y.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those curious as to why the discrepancies exist between agencies the UK MetOffice provides the following, from their article: [An overview of global annual average temperature anomalies in 2016](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/news/2017/overview-global-temperature-2016):

**Why the differences?**

One major difference between the data sets is the way they deal with geographically-uneven sampling. It leads to a difference in the degree to which they attempt to fill gaps in the station network using information from nearby stations, as illustrated in Figure 2. All the data sets perform some degree of interpolation, but the GISTEMP, Berkeley and CW data sets  in fact those which have 2016 as much warmer than 2015  do the most interpolation. On the other hand, the HadCRUT4 and NOAAGlobalTemp estimates (in which 2016 is warmer than 2015 by a smaller margin) do less interpolation and, most importantly for the discussion here, they do not interpolate extensively into the polar regions which were particularly warm in November 2016.

___

**Abstract**

Thermokarst is the process whereby the thawing of ice-rich permafrost ground causes land subsidence, resulting in development of distinctive landforms. Accelerated thermokarst due to climate change will damage infrastructure, but also impact hydrology, ecology and biogeochemistry. Here, we present a circumpolar assessment of the distribution of thermokarst landscapes, defined as landscapes comprised of current thermokarst landforms and areas susceptible to future thermokarst development. At 3.6  10^6 km^2 , thermokarst landscapes are estimated to cover 20% of the northern permafrost region, with approximately equal contributions from three landscape types where characteristic wetland, lake and hillslope thermokarst landforms occur. We estimate that approximately half of the below-ground organic carbon within the study region is stored in thermokarst landscapes. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly considering thermokarst when assessing impacts of climate change, including future landscape greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a means for assessing such impacts at the circumpolar scale. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The differential warming of land and ocean leads to many continental regions in the Northern Hemisphere warming at rates higher than the global mean temperature. Adaptation and conservation efforts will, therefore, benefit from understanding regional consequences of limiting the global mean temperature increase to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, a limit agreed upon at the United Nations Climate Summit in Paris in December 2015. Here, we analyze climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to determine the timing and magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes across the contiguous United States (US) for global warming of 1.5 and 2C and highlight consensus and uncertainties in model projections and their implications for making decisions. The regional warming rates differ considerably across the contiguous US, but all regions are projected to reach 2C about 10-20 years before the global mean temperature. Although there is uncertainty in the timing of exactly when the 1.5 and 2C thresholds will be crossed regionally, over 80% of the models project at least 2C warming by 2050 for all regions for the high emissions scenario. This threshold-based approach also highlights regional variations in the rate of warming across the US. The fastest warming region in the contiguous US is the Northeast, which is projected to warm by 3C when global warming reaches 2C. The signal-to-noise ratio calculations indicate that the regional warming estimates remain outside the envelope of uncertainty throughout the twenty-first century, making them potentially useful to planners. The regional precipitation projections for global warming of 1.5C and 2C are uncertain, but the eastern US is projected to experience wetter winters and the Great Plains and the Northwest US are projected to experience drier summers in the future. The impact of different scenarios on regional precipitation projections is negligible throughout the twenty-first century compared to uncertainties associated with internal variability and model diversity. </TEXT>

Sixty-six million years ago, the end-Cretaceous mass extinction ended the reign of the dinosaurs.

Modeling the environmental changes after the Chicxulub impact can shed light on this question. Existing studies, however, focused on the effect of dust or used one-dimensional, noncoupled atmosphere models. Here we explore the longer-lasting cooling due to sulfate aerosols using a coupled climate model. Depending on aerosol stratospheric residence time, global annual mean surface air temperature decreased by at least 26C, with 3 to 16 years subfreezing temperatures and a recovery time larger than 30 years. The surface cooling triggered vigorous ocean mixing which could have resulted in a plankton bloom due to upwelling of nutrients.

___

**Abstract**

The lack of landmasses, climatological low pressure, and strong circumpolar westerly winds between the latitudes of 50S to 65S produce exceptional storm-driven wave conditions in the Southern Ocean. This combination makes the Antarctic Peninsula one of Earth's most notable regions of high-amplitude wave activity and thus, ocean-swell-driven microseism noise in both the primary (direct wave-coastal region interactions) and secondary (direct ocean floor forcing due to interacting wave trains) period bands. Microseism observations are examined across 23 years (19932015) from Palmer Station (PMSA), on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and from East Falkland Island (EFI). These records provide a spatially integrative measure of both Southern Ocean wave amplitudes and the interactions between ocean waves and the solid Earth in the presence of sea ice, which can reduce wave coupling with the continental shelf. We utilize a spatiotemporal correlation-based approach to illuminate how the distribution of sea ice influences seasonal microseism power. We characterize primary and secondary microseism power due to variations in sea ice and find that primary microseism energy is both more sensitive to sea ice and more capable of propagating across ocean basins than secondary microseism energy. During positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode, sea ice is reduced in the Bellingshausen Sea and overall storm activity in the Drake Passage increases, thus strongly increasing microseism power levels. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Recent reports suggest that host-seeking nymphs in southern populations of Ixodes scapularis remain below the leaf litter surface, while northern nymphs seek hosts on leaves and twigs above the litter surface. This behavioral difference potentially results in decreased tick contact with humans in the south, and fewer cases of Lyme disease. We studied whether north-south differences in tick survival patterns might contribute to this phenomenon. Four month old larvae resulting from a cross between Wisconsin males and South Carolina females died faster under southern than under northern conditions in the lab, as has previously been reported for ticks from both northern and southern populations. However, newly-emerged larvae from Rhode Island parents did not differ consistently in mortality under northern and southern conditions, possibly because of their younger age. Survival is lower, and so the north-south survival difference might be greater in older ticks. Larval survival was positively related to larval size (as measured by scutal area), while survival was positively related to larval fat content in some, but not all, trials. The difference in larval survival under northern vs. southern conditions might simply result from faster metabolism under warmer southern conditions leading to shorter life spans. However, ticks consistently died faster under southern than under northern conditions in the laboratory when relative humidity was low (75%), but not under moderate (85%) or high (95%) RH. Therefore, mortality due to desiccation stress is greater under southern than under northern conditions. We hypothesize that mortality resulting from the greater desiccation stress under southern conditions acts as a selective pressure resulting in the evolution of host-seeking behavior in which immatures remain below the leaf litter surface in southern I. scapularis populations, so as to avoid the desiccating conditions at the surface. If this hypothesis is correct, it has implications for the effect of climate change on the future distribution of Lyme disease. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Climate change remains one of the major international environmental challenges facing nations. Yet nations have to date taken minimal policies to slow climate change. Moreover, there has been no major improvement in emissions trends as of the latest data. The current study uses the updated DICE model to present new projections and the impacts of alternative climate policies. It also presents a new set of estimates of the uncertainties about future climate change and compares the results will those of other integrated assessment models. The study confirms past estimates of likely rapid climate change over the next century if there are not major climate-change policies. It suggests that it will be extremely difficult to achieve the 2C target of international agreements even if ambitious policies are introduced in the near term. The required carbon price needed to achieve current targets has risen over time as policies have been delayed.  </TEXT>

During the last glacial period, the North Atlantic region experienced a series of DansgaardOeschger cycles in which climate abruptly alternated between warm and cold periods. Corresponding variations in Antarctic surface temperature were out of phase with their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The temperature relationship between the hemispheres is commonly attributed to an interhemispheric redistribution of heat by the ocean overturning circulation. Changes in ocean heat transport should be accompanied by changes in atmospheric circulation to satisfy global energy budget constraints. Although changes in tropical atmospheric circulation linked to abrupt events in the Northern Hemisphere are well documented, evidence for predicted changes in the Southern Hemispheres atmospheric circulation during DansgaardOeschger cycles is lacking. Here we use a high-resolution deuterium-excess record from West Antarctica to show that the latitude of the mean moisture source for Antarctic precipitation changed in phase with abrupt shifts in Northern Hemisphere climate, and significantly before Antarctic temperature change. This provides direct evidence that Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude storm tracks shifted within decades of abrupt changes in the North Atlantic, in parallel with meridional migrations of the intertropical convergence zone. We conclude that both oceanic and atmospheric processes, operating on different timescales, link the hemispheres during abrupt climate change. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

As the Earth's climate has changed, Arctic sea ice extent has decreased drastically. It is likely that the late-summer Arctic will be ice-free as soon as the 2030s. This loss of sea ice represents one of the most severe positive feedbacks in the climate system, as sunlight that would otherwise be reflected by sea ice is absorbed by open ocean. It is unlikely that CO2 levels and mean temperatures can be decreased in time to prevent this loss, so restoring sea ice artificially is an imperative. Here we investigate a means for enhancing Arctic sea ice production by using wind power during the Arctic winter to pump water to the surface, where it will freeze more rapidly. We show that where appropriate devices are employed, it is possible to increase ice thickness above natural levels, by about 1 m over the course of the winter. We examine the effects this has in the Arctic climate, concluding that deployment over 10% of the Arctic, especially where ice survival is marginal, could more than reverse current trends of ice loss in the Arctic, using existing industrial capacity. We propose that winter ice thickening by wind-powered pumps be considered and assessed as part of a multi-pronged strategy for restoring sea ice and arresting the strongest feedbacks in the climate system. </TEXT>

___

**Summary**

Ocean surface warming is resulting in an expansion of stratified, low-nutrient environments, a process referred to as ocean desertification. A challenge for assessing the impact of these changes is the lack of robust baseline information on the biological communities that carry out marine photosynthesis. Phytoplankton perform half of global biological CO2 uptake, fuel marine food chains, and include diverse eukaryotic algae that have photosynthetic organelles (plastids) acquired through multiple evolutionary events. While amassing data from ocean ecosystems for the Baselines Initiative (6,177 near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and 9.4 million high-quality 16S V1-V2 amplicons) we identified two deep-branching plastid lineages based on 16S rRNA gene data. The two lineages have global distributions, but do not correspond to known phytoplankton. How the newly discovered phytoplankton lineages contribute to food chains and vertical carbon export to the deep sea remains unknown, but their prevalence in expanding, low nutrient surface waters suggests they will have a role in future oceans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Centuries of thermal sea-level rise due to anthropogenic emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/03/1612066114.short?rss=1)
___

**Significance**

Human activities such as fossil-fuel burning have increased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which have warmed the Earths atmosphere and ocean and caused sea levels to rise. Some of these GHGs (e.g., methane) have atmospheric lifetimes of decades or less, whereas others (e.g., carbon dioxide) persist for centuries to millennia. As policy seeks to reduce climate changes, it is important to understand how mitigation of different gases each contributes to this goal. Our study shows that short-lived GHGs contribute to thermal expansion of the ocean over much longer time scales than their atmospheric lifetimes. Actions taken to reduce emissions of short-lived gases could mitigate centuries of additional future sea-level rise.

**Abstract**

Mitigation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases with short lifetimes (order of a year to decades) can contribute to limiting warming, but less attention has been paid to their impacts on longer-term sea-level rise. We show that short-lived greenhouse gases contribute to sea-level rise through thermal expansion (TSLR) over much longer time scales than their atmospheric lifetimes. For example, at least half of the TSLR due to increases in methane is expected to remain present for more than 200 y, even if anthropogenic emissions cease altogether, despite the 10-y atmospheric lifetime of this gas. Chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons have already been phased out under the Montreal Protocol due to concerns about ozone depletion and provide an illustration of how emission reductions avoid multiple centuries of future TSLR. We examine the world avoided by the Montreal Protocol by showing that if these gases had instead been eliminated in 2050, additional TSLR of up to about 14 cm would be expected in the 21st century, with continuing contributions lasting more than 500 y. Emissions of the hydrofluorocarbon substitutes in the next half-century would also contribute to centuries of future TSLR. Consideration of the time scales of reversibility of TSLR due to short-lived substances provides insights into physical processes: sea-level rise is often assumed to follow air temperature, but this assumption holds only for TSLR when temperatures are increasing. We present a more complete formulation that is accurate even when atmospheric temperatures are stable or decreasing due to reductions in short-lived gases or net radiative forcing.

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Climatic regulation of the neurotoxin domoic acid](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/03/1606798114.full)
___

**Significance**

We investigate regulation of domoic acid, a potent marine phycotoxin, at the climate scale. Due to the threat domoic acid can pose to public health, marine wildlife, and coastal economies, decades of laboratory experiments have examined controls on domoic acid production without reaching consensus on reliable toxin-producing conditions. Our findings reveal an association between domoic acid in shellfish and climate-scale warm ocean conditions, a unique, large-scale perspective relative to previous work.

**Abstract**

Domoic acid is a potent neurotoxin produced by certain marine microalgae that can accumulate in the foodweb, posing a health threat to human seafood consumers and wildlife in coastal regions worldwide. Evidence of climatic regulation of domoic acid in shellfish over the past 20 y in the Northern California Current regime is shown. The timing of elevated domoic acid is strongly related to warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Oceanic Nio Index, an indicator of El Nio events. Ocean conditions in the northeast Pacific that are associated with warm phases of these indices, including changes in prevailing currents and advection of anomalously warm water masses onto the continental shelf, are hypothesized to contribute to increases in this toxin. We present an applied domoic acid risk assessment model for the US West Coast based on combined climatic and local variables. Evidence of regional- to basin-scale controls on domoic acid has not previously been presented. Our findings have implications in coastal zones worldwide that are affected by this toxin and are particularly relevant given the increased frequency of anomalously warm ocean conditions. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Pine Island Glacier has undergone several major iceberg calving events over the past decades. These typically occurred when a rift at the heavily fractured shear margin propagated across the width of the ice shelf. This type of calving is common on polar ice shelves, with no clear connection to ocean-ice dynamic forcing. In contrast, we report on the recent development of multiple rifts initiating from basal crevasses in the center of the ice shelf, resulted in calving further upglacier than previously observed. Coincident with rift formation was the sudden disintegration of the ice mlange that filled the northern shear margin, resulting in ice sheet detachment from this margin. Examination of ice velocity suggests that this internal rifting resulted from the combination of a change in ice shelf stress regime caused by disintegration of the mlange and intensified melting within basal crevasses, both of which may be linked to ocean forcing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are lengthy, and detailed explanations but the short answers are simple and effective. The current Solar cycle, [cycle 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle_24), which began in 2008 is the weakest solar cycle in over a century - yet Earth's globally averaged temperature continues to warm. Furthermore, if the Sun was the main driver of recent warming trends, we should see warming of all the layers of the Earth's atmosphere warming together, seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/6spCprE.jpg); however, we do not. What we see is warming in the lower most layers and cooling the upper layers, seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/7B1JiXB.jpg). This is one of the predictions of global warming, as the concentration of GHGs within the troposphere increase they trap more and more thermal radiation, preventing a portion of it from reaching the upper atmosphere - thus the cooling anomaly.

The rate of heat escape from the Earth, geothermal heat flux, is slow and steady, operating on time scales that are well outside of modern warming rates. Current evidence of warming below ~2000m shows no measurable warming^[1](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/06oct_abyss) . </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are moderate in most climate model projections under increasing greenhouse gas forcing. This intermodel consensus may be an artifact of common model biases that favor a stable AMOC. Observationally based freshwater budget analyses suggest that the AMOC is in an unstable regime susceptible for large changes in response to perturbations. By correcting the model biases, we show that the AMOC collapses 300 years after the atmospheric CO2 concentration is abruptly doubled from the 1990 level. Compared to an uncorrected model, the AMOC collapse brings about large, markedly different climate responses: a prominent cooling over the northern North Atlantic and neighboring areas, sea ice increases over the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian seas and to the south of Greenland, and a significant southward rain-belt migration over the tropical Atlantic. Our results highlight the need to develop dynamical metrics to constrain models and the importance of reducing model biases in long-term climate projection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correct. More clearly stated, temperature data has been collected from the deep ocean, and the use of ARGO floats represents but one of several methods used to collect such data. The paper cited in the figure may be of interest to you: "[World ocean heat content and thermosteric sea level change (02000 m), 19552010](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL051106/full#grl29030-bib-0005)" as it contains references to other / historical data sets and methods, for example, "[Warming of the world ocean, 19552003](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004GL021592/full)." Both papers linked here are open access.

My initial comment was to merely to point out that they do collect data from depth, not to describe the methods themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are *still* in an ice age, known as the Ice Age which started 2.58 million years ago and marks the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch. We are currently within a warm period known as [MIS 1](http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/geos462/QuaTimeMIS.jpg), or an interglacial in the current ice age known as the Holocene which began ~11.7 thousand years ago. 

Natural cycles in orbital parameters, known as Milankovitch cycles, indicate that the Earth should be entering a cooling phase - a glacial period - however, it has been well established that under recent Earth system conditions atmospheric CO2 must fall below at least 280ppm to initiate the onset of a glacial period. This is easily seen on the [Keeling curve](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/co2_800k.png) as well as our current atmospheric CO2 level.

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Assessing recent warming using instrumentally homogeneous sea surface temperature records](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601207.full)
___

**Abstract**

Sea surface temperature (SST) records are subject to potential biases due to changing instrumentation and measurement practices. Significant differences exist between commonly used composite SST reconstructions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST), the Hadley Centre SST data set (HadSST3), and the Japanese Meteorological Agencys Centennial Observation-Based Estimates of SSTs (COBE-SST) from 2003 to the present. The update from ERSST version 3b to version 4 resulted in an increase in the operational SST trend estimate during the last 19 years from 0.07 to 0.12C per decade, indicating a higher rate of warming in recent years. We show that ERSST version 4 trends generally agree with largely independent, near-global, and instrumentally homogeneous SST measurements from floating buoys, Argo floats, and radiometer-based satellite measurements that have been developed and deployed during the past two decades. We find a large cooling bias in ERSST version 3b and smaller but significant cooling biases in HadSST3 and COBE-SST from 2003 to the present, with respect to most series examined. These results suggest that reported rates of SST warming in recent years have been underestimated in these three data sets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone know why this so called hiatus was so widely publicized?

In part, different data sets. Specifically two that are known to be problematic, due to satellite drift, etc. The denialist camp typically disproves of data sets by NASA (GIS), and the UK Met Office (HadCRUT) while vouching for data sets that rely solely on satellite data such as the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and the UAH satellite temperature dataset (published by John Christy and Roy Spencer, both climate science denialists). Most cherry pick a start date of 1998 (one of the strongest El Nino events in recent history)... 

Plotting the different data sets from 1998 to 2016 the differences are quite apparent:

- [RSS](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/rss/from:1998/to:2016/plot/rss/from:1998/to:2016/trend)

- [UAH](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/uah6/from:1998/to:2016/plot/uah6/from:1998/to:2016/trend)

- [GIS](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1998/to:2016/plot/gistemp/from:1998/to:2016/trend)

- [HadCRUT](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1998/to:2016/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1998/to:2016/trend)

Leaving the climate denialists cherry picked dates behind, the actual scientific community - depending on which data sets they incorporated and which methods they used - did see a decrease in the overall rate of warming, though it was still warming, while others argued that there was no decrease in the overall rate of warming.

It seems more like an underestimate of warming...

A large number of scientists would agree with that statement. You may find the following article on this study to be elucidating: [Assessing Recent Warming Using Instrumentally Homogenous Sea Surface Temperature Records](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/ihsst2016/background.html)

	<TEXT> They are in one scenario and they are not in another. They run several model runs under two different representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5   RCP8.5) and compare their findings.

The representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are named according to radiative forcing target level for 2100, where each approximately corresponds to an atmospheric CO2 concentration value as follows:

Representative Concentration Pathway | Description
---|---|----
RCP8.5 | Rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8.5 W/m2 (~1370 ppm CO2 eq) by 2100. |
RCP6 | Stabilization without overshoot pathway to 6 W/m2 (~850 ppm CO2 eq) at stabilization after 2100 |
RCP4.5 | Stabilization without overshoot pathway to 4.5 W/m2 (~650 ppm CO2 eq) at stabilization after 2100 |
RCP2.6 | Peak in radiative forcing at ~3 W/m2 (~490 ppm CO2 eq) before 2100 and then decline (the selected pathway declines to 2.6 W/m2 by 2100) | 
[source](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0148-z)

Each RCP contains the same categories of data, but the values vary a great deal, reflecting different emission trajectories over time as determined by the underlying socio-economic assumptions (which are unique to each RCP). While RCP4.5 (and others except RCP8.5) assume stabilization of CO2 emissions (through some form of mitigation policies, technology, etc) RCP8.5 does not:

RCP8.5 is a so-called baseline scenario that does not include any specific climate mitigation target. The greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations in this scenario increase considerably over time, leading to a radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m2 at the end of the century.^[1](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0149-y)

This study looked at RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and found the following:

...our results suggest that if, by mitigation measures, CO2 levels are kept well below those projected by the business-as-usual RCP8.5 scenario, the effect of GrIS mass loss on the AMOC strength will likely remain limited and an AMOC collapse, and its potentially dangerous impacts, is very unlikely.

___

**Abstract**

Precipitation-gauge observations and atmospheric reanalysis are combined to develop an analogue method for detecting heavy precipitation events based on prevailing large-scale atmospheric conditions. Combinations of atmospheric variables for circulation (geopotential height and wind vector) and moisture (surface specific humidity, column and up to 500hPa precipitable water) are examined to construct analogue schemes for the winter (December-January-February, DJF) of the Pacific Coast California (PCCA) and the summer (June-July-August, JJA) of the Midwestern United States (MWST). The detection diagnostics of analogue schemes are calibrated with 1979-2005 and validated with 2006-2014 NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). All analogue schemes are found to significantly improve upon MERRA precipitation in characterizing the occurrence and interannual variations of observed heavy precipitation events in the MWST. When evaluated with the late 20th century climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), all analogue schemes produce model medians of heavy precipitation frequency that are more consistent with observations and have smaller inter-model discrepancies than model-based precipitation. Under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, the CMIP5-based analogue schemes produce trends in heavy precipitation occurrence through the 21st century that are consistent with model-based precipitation  but with smaller inter-model disparity. The median trends in heavy precipitation frequency are positive for DJF over PCCA, but are slightly negative for JJA over the MWST. Overall, the analyses highlight the potential of the analogue as a powerful diagnostic tool for model deficiencies and its complementarity to an evaluation of heavy precipitation frequency based on model precipitation alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Projecting RCP8.5 out to 2300 is not realistic, and projecting RCP8.5 out to 2100 shows no collapse of the AMOC, only a weakening by ~37%... that's essentially my initial point. Under no circumstance do we see a likelihood greater than 45% of the AMOC actually collapsing, and the only way we get close is by projecting RCP8.5 out to 2300. When the world is already concerned about emissions, now, and beginning to take action I find it entirely unrealistic to assume a 'business as usual' scenario for another nearly 300 years. That's not to say it's not useful to do so, just that it isn't representative of the real world. 

In regard to energy resources trends tend to show at least a plateau by 2040, for example, the National Energy Board projections, [here](https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2016/index-eng.html) (which is in good agreement with others such as OPEC). The key issue many have raised in regard to the projections claimed by the NEB is that they do not take into account *any* climate mitigation policies. They note this themselves under their uncertainties:

In late 2015, the Paris Climate Conference culminated in an ambitious new global climate agreement which will have significant implications for Canadian and global energy use trends. Policies and programs that may result from various recent provincial announcements and the Paris Agreement are not included in the analysis in EF 2016.

Canada's provinces have already implemented carbon tax or cap   trade policies as of this year (some prior). Supply is also projected to decline by mid century where it peaks around 2025 and declines thereafter^[1](http://i.imgur.com/GEncKPO.jpg), ^[2](http://i.imgur.com/pb8Ivok.jpg) ([source](http://woo.opec.org/)).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Though it was not included in the title it's important to note the following for context:

We find that GrIS melting affects AMOC projections, even though it is of secondary importance. By years 20902100, the AMOC weakens by 18% [3%, 34%; 90% probability] in an intermediate greenhouse-gas mitigation scenario and by 37% [15%, 65%] under continued high emissions. Afterward, it stabilizes in the former but continues to decline in the latter to 74% [+4%, 100%] by 22902300, with a 44% likelihood of an AMOC collapse. This result suggests that an AMOC collapse can be avoided by CO2 mitigation.

If I'm not mistaken, all projections see a significant decrease in the combustion of fossil fuels for energy production with further decreases noted by energy companies ~~as a result of declining oil and gas reserves~~ by ~mid century. It seems folly to therefore extrapolate continued high emissions scenarios upwards of nearly 300 years into the future, and therefore almost certain (on this studies values) that the AMOC will not collapse.

Furthermore, there is some degree of doubt as to whether or not current observed reduction in the AMOC is actually a slowing down, or a return to normal from a relative high. Depending on the assumptions (initial conditions) of this paper, this may further extend the stability of the AMOC. 

EDIT: Supply, not necessarily reserves </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Ammonia (NH3) has been detected in the upper troposphere by the analysis of averaged MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) infrared limb-emission spectra. We have found enhanced amounts of NH3 within the region of the Asian summer monsoon at 1215km altitude. Three-monthly, 10 longitude10 latitude average profiles reaching maximum mixing ratios of around 30pptv in this altitude range have been retrieved, with a vertical resolution of 38km and estimated errors of about 5pptv. These observations show that loss processes during transport from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere within the Asian monsoon do not deplete the air entirely of NH3. Thus, ammonia might contribute to the so-called Asian tropopause aerosol layer by the formation of ammonium aerosol particles. On a global scale, outside the monsoon area and during different seasons, we could not detect enhanced values of NH3 above the actual detection limit of about 35pptv. This upper bound helps to constrain global model simulations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Comprehensive analysis of nanodiamond evidence relating to the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.2892/full)
___

**Abstract**:

During the end of the last glacial period in the Northern Hemisphere near 12.9k cal a BP, deglacial warming of the Bllingllerod interstadial ceased abruptly and the climate returned to glacial conditions for an interval of about 1300 years known as the Younger Dryas stadial. The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis proposes that the onset of the Younger Dryas climate reversal, Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions and disappearance of the Clovis paleoindian lithic technology were coeval and caused by continent-wide catastrophic effects of impact/bolide events in North America. While there are no known impact structures dated to the Younger Dryas onset, physical evidence of the impact/bolide events is argued to be present in sediments spanning several continents at stratigraphic levels inferred to date to the Blling-llerod/Younger Dryas boundary (YDB). Reports of nanometer to submicron-sized diamonds in YDB sediments, in particular the rare 2H hexagonal polytype of diamond, lonsdaleite, have been presented as strong evidence for shock processing of crustal materials. We review the available data on diamonds in sediments and provide new data. We find no evidence for lonsdaleite in YDB sediments and find no evidence of a spike in nanodiamond concentration at the YDB layer to support the impact hypothesis.

___

**Abstract**:

Fluvial sequences from the late Pleistocene to the Holocene are exposed in Arlington Canyon, Santa Rosa Island, Northern Channel Islands, California, USA, including one outcrop that features centrally in the controversial hypothesis of an extra-terrestrial impact at the onset of the Younger Dryas. The fluvial sequence in Arlington Canyon contains a significant quantity and range of organic material, much of which has been charred. The purpose of this study was to systematically describe the key outcrop of the Arlington sequence, provide new radiocarbon age control and analyse organic material in the Arlington sediments within a rigorous palaeobotanical and palaeo-charcoal context. These analyses provide a test of previous claims for catastrophic impact-induced fire in Arlington Canyon. Carbonaceous spherular materials were identified as predominantly fungal sclerotia; carbon elongates are predominantly arthropod coprolites, including termite frass. Glassy carbon formed from the precipitation of tars during charcoalification. None of these materials indicate high-temperature formation or combustion. Charcoal and other materials in Arlington Canyon document widespread and frequent fires both before and after the onset of the Younger Dryas, recording predominantly low-temperature surface fires. In summary, we find no evidence in Arlington Canyon for an extra-terrestrial impact or catastrophic impact-induced fire.

	<TEXT> ...does not represent a general trend over a longer period of time.

That's incorrect, both currently, and forecasting into the future. The study itself (which can be found [here](https://wwa.climatecentral.org/analyses/north-pole-nov-dec-2016/)) states the following:

Finally, warm episodes near the pole are usually due to so-called moist intrusions: warm and moist air from the mid-latitudes that not only advects heat, but also clouds that block outgoing long-wave radiation and hence trap more heat. There is some evidence that these have become more frequent (Woods and Caballero, 2016). [Figure 4](https://worldweatherattribution.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/fig4.png)

Furthermore the modelling ensembles were unable to produce events such as this without including human induced climate change:

These results suggest that it is extremely unlikely this event would occur in the absence of human-induced climate change. 

See [Figure 9](https://worldweatherattribution.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/fig9.png) Probability Density Functions of Arctic temperature anomalies in the ALL-forcings ensemble (red) and NAT-forcings ensemble (blue).

Climate attribution is a growing area of research and we can most certainly say whether or not an event may or may not have been made more likely due to global warming.

	<TEXT> Study: [Direct observation of ice nucleation events on individual atmospheric particles](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/CP/C6CP05253C#!divAbstract)
___

**abstract**

Heterogeneous ice nucleation is a physical chemistry process of critical relevance to a range of topics in the fundamental and applied sciences and technologies. Heterogeneous ice nucleation remains insufficiently understood, partially due to the lack of experimental methods capable of obtaining in situ microscopic details of ice formation over nucleating substrates or particles. We present microscopic observations of ice nucleation events on kaolinite particles at the nanoscale and demonstrate the capability of direct tracking and micro-spectroscopic characterization of individual ice nucleating particles (INPs) in an authentic atmospheric sample. This approach utilizes a custom-built ice nucleation cell, interfaced with an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (IN-ESEM platform) operated at temperatures and relative humidities relevant for heterogeneous ice nucleation. The IN-ESEM platform allows dynamic observations of individual ice formation events over particles in isobaric and isothermal experiments. Isothermal experiments on individual kaolinite particles demonstrate that ice crystals preferably nucleate at the edges of the stacked kaolinite platelets, rather than on their basal planes. These experimental observations of the location of ice nucleation provide direct information for further theoretical chemistry predictions of ice formation on kaolinite. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To me this is like climate skeptics saying "reminder, in 1975 scientists thought there was going to be another ice age"

Except that the vast majority of scientists never said that, that was largely a result of false equivalence by the media of that time. See, '[The Myth of the Global Cooling Consensus](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1)' (pdf).
Similarly, there are claims by fringe scientists that the denialist camp cherry picks such as those made by [Peter Wadhams](http://climatefeedback.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Peter-Wadhams-ice-free-arctic-claims.png) in attempts to discredit mainstream consensus.

The key point is that, contrary to what climate science denialists tout, climate models have done what most would consider to be a very reasonable job at predicting future temperatures for a considerable amount of time, and they continue to do so.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Stability of peatland carbon to rising temperatures](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13723)
___

**Abstract**:

Peatlands contain one-third of soil carbon (C), mostly buried in deep, saturated anoxic zones (catotelm). The response of catotelm C to climate forcing is uncertain, because prior experiments have focused on surface warming. We show that deep peat heating of a 2m-thick peat column results in an exponential increase in CH4 emissions. However, this response is due solely to surface processes and not degradation of catotelm peat. Incubations show that only the top 2030cm of peat from experimental plots have higher CH4 production rates at elevated temperatures. Radiocarbon analyses demonstrate that CH4 and CO2 are produced primarily from decomposition of surface-derived modern photosynthate, not catotelm C. There are no differences in microbial abundances, dissolved organic matter concentrations or degradative enzyme activities among treatments. These results suggest that although surface peat will respond to increasing temperature, the large reservoir of catotelm C is stable under current anoxic conditions. </TEXT>

___

**Significance**

This study quantifies the impact of climate variability on Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission by two mosquito vectors with distinct characteristics: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Observed climate data were used to dynamically drive a two vectorsone host R0 epidemiological model. Our modeling results indicate that temperature conditions related to the 2015 El Nio climate phenomenon were exceptionally conducive for mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV over South America. The virus is believed to have entered the continent earlier in 2013. This finding implicates that such a large ZIKV outbreak occurred not solely because of the introduction of ZIKV in a naive population, but because the climatic conditions were optimal for mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV over South America in 2015.
 
**Abstract**

Zika, a mosquito-borne viral disease that emerged in South America in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO in February of 2016. We developed a climate-driven R0 mathematical model for the transmission risk of Zika virus (ZIKV) that explicitly includes two key mosquito vector species: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The model was parameterized and calibrated using the most up to date information from the available literature. It was then driven by observed gridded temperature and rainfall datasets for the period 19502015. We find that the transmission risk in South America in 2015 was the highest since 1950. This maximum is related to favoring temperature conditions that caused the simulated biting rates to be largest and mosquito mortality rates and extrinsic incubation periods to be smallest in 2015. This event followed the suspected introduction of ZIKV in Brazil in 2013. The ZIKV outbreak in Latin America has very likely been fueled by the 20152016 El Nio climate phenomenon affecting the region. The highest transmission risk globally is in South America and tropical countries where Ae. aegypti is abundant. Transmission risk is strongly seasonal in temperate regions where Ae. albopictus is present, with significant risk of ZIKV transmission in the southeastern states of the United States, in southern China, and to a lesser extent, over southern Europe during the boreal summer season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> np is short for 'No Participation.' It's perfectly safe, however, it's simply a read-only version which means you're discouraged from voting and commenting as they are disabled by default. It's to prevent 'brigading' of linked threads. You can apply it to any link, and as long as that sub supports it you will be directed to the 'no participation' stylesheet. There's also nothing stopping you from removing the np from the url should you choose to do so. I appreciate your concerns though.

Thank you for this, my math skill are limited, but I get the gist of it.

After I submitted the comment, I felt I could have explained it better. That being said, take your time and go over the link I provided. It does a reasonable job at communicating the math. </TEXT>
