	<TEXT> **Vast** I know, right?? I heard all the hype about it before I ever saw the game and it looks like something a middle schooler  doodled in his textbook! I was shocked at how plain it is. Must be great mechanics though cause nobody's buying it for the art. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always thought **GOSU** looks like a neat game mechanically, but the goblin artwork on the cards, while very well done, just kind of turns me off, and would certainly my wife who is my main gaming partner.  
  
Additionally, **La Granja** looks like a great game, but the theme of farming is not epic in scope enough for my tastes. Take the same game and make it about building a city, or a space station, or managing the trades of an entire country and I enjoy it more. I find games that are too narrow or small in scope don't inspire me as much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, I mostly play 2P games with my wife and she absolutely LOVES **Seasons** and **Castles of Burgundy**, though we own several other games. I've been trying to find a game similar to those that she'd enjoy, but Race is a huge turn off bc of the iconography. So we picked up **San Juan** but it's fairly light compared to her Top Two, and she was kinda meh on it.  
  
So I've been looking at **Roll** and thinking maybe that would be more fun for her? CoB and Seasons both have dice allocation as a major factor... Has anyone played both games to compare? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sitting in a mostly abandoned shopping mall on one of those benches outside a clothing outfitter. My brother is sitting next to me waiting for our mom to finish up shopping. I notice a weird painting on the wall across the hallway from us and after looking at it for a bit I break the silence and say, "Man, is that one ugly woman!!" Right as a woman walks past us in front of the painting. She looked furious, but I was too stunned to formulate a believable excuse. Still cringe to this day. </TEXT>
