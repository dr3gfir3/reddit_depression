	<TITLE> Best over/under shotgun for under $1500? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Afternoon folks, 

I'm wanting a new bird gun and I was wondering what you all use, and prefer, in the over/under shotgun field. 
I have always used semi autos for dove, but I want a gun that has a little more aesthetic appeal than my workhorse hunting rifle. 

What shotgun should I be considering to invest under $1500 into if I'm looking for a well made, pretty but reliable gun?

	<TEXT> Very easy, my friend. My recipe serves 2-4 people.

- 2 Sticks of the best butter you can buy (I use Plugra)
- 2 Cups heavy cream 
- 2 Cups parmesan/asiago cheese 
- 2-4 Garlic cloves, depending on how much you like garlic
- 2 Lemons juiced fresh
- Pepper, ample amounts to taste 
- Salt to taste
- 3/4 Shrimp, peeled and devaned 
- Pasta of your choosing

0) Begin boiling your pasta. 

1) In a saucepan melt your butter, then combine your garlic to brown just a bit in the butter. 

2) Add your heavy cream to the butter and reduce for 5 minutes or so on low heat. The sauce should reduce but still be runny enough to wiggle in the pan with little effort.

3) Add your cheese, pepper, and salt to the milk/better mixture. Whisk until smooth. Reserve a little cheese for 
plating.

4) Drain pasta and in another pan quickly sautee the shrimp in some butter with lemon and garlic. 

5) Combine drained pasta with the alfredo sauce over low heat. 

6) Plate pasta and add shrimp.

Enjoy! </TEXT>
