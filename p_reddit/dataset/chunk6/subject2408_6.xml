	<TEXT> Your point?Even if they were already published, they were compiled last year weren't they? And the author says he wants to continue writing these stories though he has said he'd like to give it the care it deserves which basically means he's gonna be very slow with them: https://www.reddit.com/r/hyouka/comments/5xm17i/yonezawa_on_future_classic_clubs_works_122016/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not because he's considered a shitty writer, just because he's heavily influenced by Western works. Though, from what little I've read of him and what little I know about Japanese culture, it does make me think that his stuff does have a Japanese feel to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That they're all sexually exploitative towards women. I stumbled upon a reddit thread where someone asked women how they felt about the sexualisation of women in anime. There was one good answer talking about how there's tons of shows that don't have that kind of stuff and that the stereotype is more prevalent than the actual sexualisation in anime. The other answers were all, "I dislike it and that's why I don't watch anime. Miyazaki is one of the few exceptions that doesn't have this." There was even a reply claiming that Miyazaki movies were the sole exceptions to this rule. Not even all of Ghibli's movies, *just* Miyazaki. Ignorant people irritate me to no end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The mangaka who wrote the source material for Tekkon Kinkreet also wrote the manga that Ping Pong is based on, that's why the style's so similar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that only applies to plot points or character archetypes. With your argument, you could even claim that using camera angles to show a character's emotions or status is a cliche because it's been done to death. It's not a plot point, it's a representation of an emotion that the viewer can easily understand. </TEXT>
