	<TITLE> Where to buy sp 404 faceplate </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-25 03:12:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Don't know if anyone here can help me but would anyone know where to buy the faceplate for an sp 404? I'm buying a used one this weekend that comes without a faceplate and I kinda want to get one so I don't break it. It also is missing a power supplu but I heard you can buy them from any electronics store for cheap. I read in the manual it takes 9v 300mA, is there anything else I should look for in regards to the charger? Canada links would be appreciated but really anything will do. I couldn't find much on google. 
Thanks! </TEXT>

I only have the mk2 but I'd imagine the studio would replace fl even better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) First pick a scale, lets say for example we want the A major scale.

2) Find the "A" in the chart, only looking at the blue top letters for now. You can see its in the 5th column, 3rd row.

3) Look above and you will see its underneath a number, in our case its 3. This means that there are 3 sharps in the A major scale. Why sharps? Because the "A" is sitting in the "#" row. If it was in the "b's" row, it would mean there were 3 flats (Eb major scale).

4) So now we know that the A maj scale has 3 sharps, now we need to know which notes are sharps. This is where the red letters come in. You'll see underneath every blue letter is a red letter, these show which notes are sharpened or flattened in each scale. All we have to do is count backwards. So in our example of A maj, the sharpened notes are G, C and F.

5) And thats it, now we have the A major scale, it should look like this - A B C# D E F# G# A </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-04-09 03:01:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In school for Hvac right now first semester. My final assignment for electrical is to build an efficient schematic out of what my instructor gives me. 

Mine was "6 switches, 3 relays, 3 lights. All lights are energized when the circuit is at rest. Activating any relay will de-energize all lights." 

I know this is a long shot but would anyone be able to help me? I'm stumped. Already tried /r/electrical. I asked him a few more questions he said all the switches are single pole and I don't have to use all relay contacts. I could make it work with less things but can't incorporate all the switches. 

Anyone got any idea? </TEXT>

I asked him a couple more questions today and all switches are single pole, all switches are open at rest and I don't have to use all the relay contacts.
