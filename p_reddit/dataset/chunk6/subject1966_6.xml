	<TEXT> Mood rings were heat sensitive rings that changed color when worn. They were cheap toy jewelery and gimmicky carnival rewards that were popular about a decade and a half ago. They might still be popular, but i havent seen any since i was like 5 or 6.

Tl;dr- a "groovy, psychedellic" and very trendy piece of jewelery. OP's joke was that the birds change color based on moods, which is what those "mood rings" supposedly did. I feel old now. </TEXT>
