	<TEXT> Free speech does mean hate speech is okay.  That's the whole point of free speech.  Harassment and verbal assault are already crimes.  Someone saying they don't like women is something they can say, even if I and most of everyone disagrees.  This self-righteous rant, acting like some sort of martyr is both sad and troubling that you're a default mod.  But I'm not telling you to delete it because it's free speech. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MINING

Copper ore farming is best in Elwynn Forest if you follow along the ridge below the East-West road, circling around the log camp and following the mountains all the way past stormwind and around Westbrook Garrison.  Durotar is good as well, just make a big circle around the edge.

Tin ore easy pickings in Alterac Vally (the zone).  Just circle around the outside of the mountains.  A good alternative is the northern part of STV, focusing on mountainous ridges.

Iron Ore is best farmed in Feralas, again making a big circle around the edge of the zone, focusing on the mountain ridges.  A decent alternative is Tenaris, though you wont find much out in the sand.

Mithril can only really be farmed in the burning steppes.  Sorry hordies.   Make a big circle around the edges, do not go into the pits as you will aggro constantly.  Much easier to circle around the outside.  If hordies don't want to walk, Felwood is an okay alternative, though not nearly as good.

Thorium is in Silithus and Winterspring, around the outsides.  Do not go into the bug hives or caves, they are packed with mobs and not worth it.

Happy farming!  Remember that everything respawns after server resets! </TEXT>

Elven is pretty cool in WoW in that words combine together into one word to form new, but related, words.  This is just like Tolkien's elvish language and the WoW language even, which share many words.  the closest translation I can find in my copy of the Silmarillion is "falas" which means shore or line of surf.  However, I've found that in the wow-verse, fal means forgotten, usually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough on the ring's cursed nature.  However, it's implied Arqgorn could master the ring, as he was able to master the Palantir and Sauron feared he had mastered the ring.  Even Frodo, with his untrained mind, had partially mastered the ring as Tolkien himself wrote in his letters, as to why the ringwraiths weren't sent to mount doom, is that they would have froze up, Sauron and Frodo's commands canceling each other out (though Frodo only held such power with the ring due to possessing it and being so close to its source.  If Sauron were closer and able to fully focus the ringwraiths would have obeyed him.). I think Dumbledore has more than enough power to master the ring more than it would master him.  However, the ring would still corrupt him, as it does all things.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well two things.  First, the ring isn't cursed, it just has a semi-autonomous personality.  It's pretty much Sauron but was totally down for being ruled by Gandalf as it just wants a powerful host.  Second, it takes someone of strong mental will and fortitude to master the ring.  Dumby has the mental stats to master the ring.  And the ring would be terrible in his hands as he already showed himself capable of bad deeds for the greater good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was thinking about him the other day, it's weird when an NPC in a video game has such a profound influence on you that you find yourself thinking about him, his situation, his thoughts.  He's crazy, you can tell that the first time you meet him and he never proves that assumption wrong.  But how crazy is he?  He treats the headcrabs as his flock, he can leave at any time and chooses not to.  But one of his random lines struck me: when he says "I remember your true face" when killing one of the infected.  The line is delivered with his usual proselytizing tone but there's a definite undertone of sadness in his voice.  He knows these people are gone, he knows he can't help them by how freely he kills them.  Why does he stay?  Did he have family he can't leave behind despite them being infected?  Does he know how the world is doing outside Ravenholm?  I hope he one day finds peace, and that's a weird feeling to have for someone who doesn't exist. </TEXT>

Fingolfin fought Morgoth in single combat, and while he lost, he was able to hold his own and even gravely wound Morgoth in the fight.  To put that in perspective, only one person can beat Morgoth, the ainur Tulkas who is literally the God of fighting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really.  Lotr elves are more like proto humans in that they're, on average,  physically stronger than humans while mentally lacking the same free will and imaginations of humans.  Elves also fade with time.  Gil-Galad was an elf from the first age and son of Fingon(I think?), making him the crown king of elves.  Being one of the first elves and royal blood makes him significantly stronger.  Two of his uncles occupy the 1 and 2 spots for strongest elf to ever live, and his relatives make up almost all of the top ten strongest elves, to give you an idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tolkien had many running themes in his works, but one of the ones most played down in the movies is that strength is in blood lines, specifically that of royal blood.  Aragorn is the rightful king, of course.  Legolas is the crowned Prince of mirkwood.  Gimli is the great great great grandson of Durin.  Gloin, Gomli's father, was Thorin's second cousin.  Boromir is the eldest son of the reagent of Gondor, who himself is likely a high noblemen.  The hobbits, save Sam, are all highborn nobles in the Shire.  Merry and Pippin are the Hobbit equivalent of princes, if I remember correctly, and Frodo is their cousin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure.  The guy who kills an end-bringer in a straight fight is someone named Scion, he's very important but I won't get into that.  He has powers above and beyond every other hero in the series.  Imagine if DC only had street level heroes, this guy is superman to them, just completely out of their league in every way.  While Scion is hands down the most powerful thing on earth, he's incredibly aloof; while a hurricane  hits Cuba, he's evacuating a school fire in Australia, while an endbringer attacks Seoul, he's saving a cat from a tree in California.  Scion doesn't eat, sleep, or stop being a hero ever.  He also doesn't really talk or communicate with anyone, most people thing he's extremely autistic or something.  At a point in the series, Scion gets it in his head to kill an endbringer instead of driving it off.  Scion grabs the endbringer, completely immune to its attacks, and bathes it in a hard light beam repeatedly until it disintegrated to nothing.  The protagonist gets to see it in person as scion slowly cooks through the Endbringer's layers until it's ash.  Later on in the series, SPOILER Scion is also seen to casually destroy Europe, for funsies (no really, he does it for funsies).  And shows himself capable of casually going through any other heroe's defenses with his hard light attack.  So while we don't know how durable and endbringer is exactly (besides the vague statement by the author that their core is as dense as a whole galaxy) we do know that the power that killed one is at least continent busting.  And it took a continent-busting-energy bath to kill one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People aren't quite getting Endbringer's durability right.  An endbringer has layers like an onion (or ogre).  Endbringers also exist in an infinite amount of alternative dimensions.  As you move down layers, more of the damage inflicted upon the endbringer is shunted off into more and more alternate dimension endbringers until you reach the core.  At the core, damage is shunted off into an infinite number of dimensions, making any damage done effectively zero.  The damage is an asymptote, as a hero is able to dish out enough damage to eventually kill one, but we're talking several minutes of constant at-least Earth-busting power.  The guy who kills the end bringer is a casual continent buster who only tries once in the entire series, when he kills the endbringer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hera was seen as the goddess of children, women, and childbirth.  But like the other god's children, I think her children would take on more nuanced powers from her.  Some powers I think would manifest: 

Curse with bad luck, the person is extremely unlucky until the curse is lifted, which only Hera and her children can do ( Hera's curses were notoriously unable to be removed but by her)

Curse as ware-animal, self explanatory, same as above, curse someone to turn into an animal during the full moon.

Attract/repel the opposite sex, self explanatory, could be used in self or others.

Godly command, Hera was the queen of gods, after all.  And Hera is the feminine version of the Greek word Heron, or Master.  This would let someone given simple commands that people follow, could be resisted by will power.

If the series was more gritty you could get into truly horrid curses like induce hysterical pregnancy or cause birthing pain, but that's a little much. </TEXT>

Majin-boo, Bibidi, and Piccolo are the three strongest magic users you'll find in DBZ.  Going further into Piccolo, he was actually a member of the Dragon Clan of Namekians who had a long history of being very powerful magic users.  King Piccolo, and by extension current Piccolo, were the most powerful magic users in the Dragon Clan, able to make dragon balls and shoot clothes beams.  Cell is 1/3 Piccolo and likely inherited enough of the Dragon Clan's inherent magic abilities to make the Cell tournament arena.

	<TEXT> Not quite true.  Endbringers are like onions (and ogres) in that they have layers.  The surface layer is extremely durable flesh.  The layer below that is the same flesh but any damage done to that later is split between the same flesh that exists in 10 other dimensions, so attacks are 90% less effective on the second layer.  The third layer adds a magnitude more dimensional displacement.  The fourth layer adds another magnitude of dimensional displacement.  So in and so forth until the encore of the endbringers is displacing damage out to an infinite number of dimensions, reducing all damage to effectively zero.

	<TEXT> Round one, yellow is mostly the US.  SA and Africa have a lot of people but lacks a modern, powerful military to compete against the US.  That said, the US is capable of stale mating the whole world by itself and only benefit from having any allies, regardless of their force projection.  

The US will own the oceans, hands down.  Not only do we have a larger navy than everyone else combined, we can spit out more faster. 

Some of the major militaries the US will be up against are:

Australia: Almost all of Australia's population is on the coast.  With that in mind, Australia will be very quickly decimated as the US's navy bombards every large populated city and sizable military base in Australia.  Every plane will be downed, every boat will be sunk, every hope of mobilizing anything beyond gorilla fishing boats will be destroyed.  People will evacuate to the bush but will be too focused on surviving to do anything.  Sorry, Aussies.  You chose the wrong side.

Japan will go much the same way as Australia thanks to their similar layout.  It will go much faster due to Japan's lack of military, though their paramilitary police will be difficult.  Still, with the US's navy circling the islands uncontested, Japan is, like Australia, crippled to the point of being harmless outside of its islands.  China will be trouble and likely try to attack while we deal with Japan.  China has a massive Army but their navy and air force are both smaller and less advanced than the US's.  The US will keep the Chinese penned inland.

the UK is another replay of Japan, with the EU countries playing the role of China just same, penned in and everything.

Mainland Eurasia is where the US forces stop steam rolling the rest of the world and their air/sea superiority becomes less of an "I Win" card.  Unfortunately for mainland Eurasia, most of their major cities are by oceans and seas.  Some areas of interest:

Southern Europe will be ran over so fast they'll call it The Blitz 2: electric bungaloo.  The US forces are already across the Mediterranean, once the US navy come knocking it won't look pretty.  There will be intense air battles all over Souther Europe, due to almost all EU members having decently sized and very modern air forces.  Unfortunately the US most likely made them and have the modern version of whatever the EU is fielding.  As well, countries like Germany and Switzerland, who could slow down the US Air Force, are in perfect position to be attacked from the north and south, splitting their already small airforces in two.  As for the land-segment of the war, the US has two very large sources of expendable soldiers, SA and Africa.  Without these two, the US forces would have no hope of taking any mainland Eurasia more than a few miles inland.

China will be a lot of flat land with a lot of troops.  Air superiority here will be easier to get and more effective thanks to the flat planes.  But the sheer size of the Chinese military is going to be a hurdle that will be hard to jump.  More so than anywhere else, overcoming China will be the hardest and most likely area to bring down the US forces.

Russia has been waiting for this moment since 1992.  Unfortunately, Russia just isn't prepared for it.  Unlike all of those who failed to invade Russia, the US and Canadian forces are very prepared for Russian winters.  Since most of Russia is in the Western side, the US will most likely attack through Scandinavia (which is a whole other thing but still horrible one-sides.). The Canadians are a force to be reckoned with and are used to the cold, as are most of the US forces thanks to a few large training bases being in the north (looking at you, Grand Rapids.  My friend from southern Texas sure enjoyed your -30f wind chill). Russia should take solace in the fact that they will tie up the most US forces since their military is very good and SA and African troops just wouldn't handle the cold as well.


The Middle East is pretty boring once Turkey is defeated.  And they will be defeated.  I honestly think, with the US at war with Geneva, they will use chemical weapons right back once they're used on the US forces.  And they will be.  Fighting here will be the most horrific with so many powers able to deploy chemical weapons and dirty bombs literally tomorrow.

I give it US forces 6.5/10.  The worst that can happen is a stalemate with the US forces unable to penetrate into Eurasia.  But the US will not lose.

For round two, things look a lot better for the US forces.  The yellow side has a clear power hierarchy in that the US will be calling the shots.  This will give the US time to train and arm the SA and African allies thoroughly in the five years leading up to the war.  The other side has too many powers.  The EU will want to boss China will want to boss Russia, will want to boss the EU, etc.  and the Middle East hates everyone.  Even with five years, the US will have a lead on arming up their side before everyone else makes a deal.  IF they make a deal.  US forces 8/10 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To understand how Gandalf and the Balrog fought, you have to understand Maiar's inherent nature.  Maiar are aspects of their patron, sort of like quasi-lesser deities overseeing aspects of their patron deities.  Gandalf was a Maiar of Manwe, who oversaw the powers (gross simplification) of voice, will, air, and Avians.  Gandalf seemed to mostly am body the spirit and voice aspects.  The Balrog was a Maiar of Morgoth, and he embodied shadow and fire.   Now understand that both of these entities are naturally bodiless and take physical form simply to interact with elves, men, orcs, etc.  

Most of the fight between Gandalf and the Balrog was non-physical.  For instance, when Gandalf said "you shall not pass."  It was his voice commanding the Balrog and the whole of reality to keep the Balrog from passing the bridge.  This is why the Balrog looks angry and seems to have trouble advancing on the bridge.  And when he does advance, the bridge obeys Gandalf and keeps the Balrog from passing.  The Balrog is attacking Gandalf with shadow and attacking him physically with his whip of fire.  In many depictions of Gandalf and the Balrog before the  the movie, you see Gandalf surrounded by shadow and standing against it.  We never saw the full battle between Gandalf and the Balrog, but it most likely looked very much like the confrontation on the bridge: mostly non-physical and the battle taking place through the fabric of reality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doylist:

When translating verses and epic poems, the translator will try to translate the original meaning as best they can and the original cadence and phonetic tools as best they can.  Take Beowulf.  If you were to pick up most translations, you would find alliteration, rhyming, couplets, etc, that would not be there if it was a direct translation (which I've read and it flows so horribly it's like reading it upside down).  But most translations, including Tolkien's own translation of Beowulf, found a balance between direct word meaning and sentence flow.  Keeping that in mind, when Tolkien was translating the Red Book of Westmarch, he most likely did what any translator would do and tried to preserve the syntax as well as the original meaning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well you could use a hack-saw very carefully rather a table saw.  And, instead of a belt sander and an hour and a half of sanding, you could just sand it for several days for several hours at a time.  Yeah you could do it, but you're taking an entire week of working on this for hours at a time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know what?  I do care about Felicity.  Felicity started out with a great, believable character arch that culminated with her be a strong female character that was useful and smart in ways the male characters were not.  Then she got flanderized.  She became what tumbler thinks a strong female is supposed to be, her smarts became super human intelligence and she became a self-insert who everyone loved despite her being awful.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Episode 1: Smoaky and the bandit.
 Kite-Man (played by Danny DeVito) is a new thief in town.  Tensions run high between Felicity and Oliver as Kite-Man steals more than her engagement ring--but also Felicity's heart.

Episode 2: Where There's Smoak There's Fire
Felicity leads both Oliver and Kite-man on as she can't choose between the two, but after jealousy leads to blows between the two suitors (Oliver loses) they end up having a threesome.

Episode 3: Up in Smoak
Kite-man has an aneurism post coitus (after a gruelingly long opening sex scene) and goes into a coma.  Felicity goes to the gynecologist and finds out she's pregnant, and has cancer with slim odds of survival.

Episode 4: Smoak It Up
Felicity gets medical marijuana and hallucinates about being a super hero.  After her bad trip she can walk again thanks to medical marijuana curing her paralyzed legs.

Episode 5: Smoak on the Water 
I drowned myself after watching the first four episodes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True but there's a difference between copying a power because it's useful and mimicking powers because you desperately want powers.  Every power he uses is shown to be an existing power in the Incredible's world.  I think being rejected by Mr. Incredible would actually be his trigger, explaining is tinker speciality and Trump rating.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as tinkers go, Syndrome is fairly high up there.  If I had to give him a number and a specialization, I would say he is a Tinker 7 with a speciality in hero mimicking, putting him at a Trump 4 as well.  Every piece of technology he has on his person is a knock off of another hero: flight, bombs, freeze ray, etc.  In the worm-verse, with more hero and villain powers to duplicate, Syndrome would be a powerful force to be reckoned with, more than earning his Tinker 7, Trump 4 rating.  Syndrome would most likely run a mid sized city or, more likely due to his ego, run a dominant gang in a large city.  He would run the large city due to his tactical knowledge but his ego would cause him to seek out the protectorate for a fight.  I could even see him being Eidolon's nemesis in Houston, with Syndrome going up against him with a slew of copied powers every other week and Eidolon having to switch his own powers on the fly to counter.  Being the rival of the strongest cape in the world might even be good for Syndrome and his massive inferiority complex to the point of his and Eidolon's relationship cooling over to the point of resembling Doom and Reed's relationship but without the history (so less trust).

So to answer your question, he would make a good Rival for Eidolon, and would toe the line between A-class and S-class, only staying in the former due to him focusing on picking fights with the protectorate rather than mass murdering civilians.   </TEXT>
