	<TEXT> I have been consistent in asking about how I would act if I lived in Greyhawk. At least, that is how its been in my head. I don't know if I explained it well.

So, it is *both* "in game" and "out of game." As in: what if you put a person from out of the game into the game? I think this is important because Greyhawk doesn't have the same physics and metaphysics as the real world. It wouldn't be realistic to be an atheist in Greyhawk, for example. Morality would function differently their.

But, in both your posts you were talking about a DnD creationist world. So, I don't know how you say you flipped worlds. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Free Will in 5th Ed </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The discussion on the inherent alignment of some races in the context of free will got me thinking of this quote from 5th Ed:

*"For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.*

*The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god's influence.)*

*Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil."*

To what extant do the races with "alignment tendencies" have free will? Does nature more than nurture play a part in the choices of some fantasy races? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's interesting to have you talk about the historical view of morality over the modern scientific one as having more relevance in DnD. But, then switch to favoring the more modern perspective over an historical one.

I'm not judging. I'm rereading some of my responses and seeing some of my own flipflops. I really am just trying to ask provocative questions to get the chance to read what people think. I don't think there is a "right" answer, in the context of DnD anyway (other than 'Rule Zero'). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I just found out in the context of Greyhawk, Gary Gygax's opinion was that goblins (and many other monster races) were inherently evil. He seemed to feel it was **G**ood to kill them in the context of his setting. He seemed to favor a black and white simplistic approach to the subject in his games.

Though, he had creative control over 1 2nd ed, not 3rd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have, actually, already studied those. Moral philosophy is a hobby of mine, and most of the books on tape I listen to (as well as the wiki pages I read) pertain to that subject. I only studied it a bit in college, however, my focus was math and physics. 

As I am sure comes out a little in the second half of my OP, I (generally speaking) subscribe to the [science of morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_morality) and ethical naturalism. Though, my particular brand is nuanced.

But, these questions are more meant to be in the context of Greyhawk. As in, what would I think if I lived in Greyhawk. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Moral Justifications of the Genocide of 'Evil' Races </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-27 22:19:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was in a Greyhawk campaign (3.5) playing as a Cleric worshiping Pelor. We found a group of goblins, who we killed. One of the other characters, a Paladin, said we should have given them a chance to surrender. This sparked a debate between him and I about whether or not goblins in Greyhawk were inherently evil, and -thus- if their genocide was morally justifiable. My character believed that it was.

I had two main arguments, one was spiritual and the other genetic.

From a spiritual standpoint, there are no good goblin gods in Greyhawk. This meant to my character that spiritually, goblins -as a race- were evil. They had no moral compass to guild them that didn't point in the wrong direction. While individual goblins might turn to other races' gods, the goblin race as a whole was irredeemable. In short, their souls were inherently evil as represented by their pantheon.

From a genetic stand point, human morals evolved from our particular pack mentality. Our capacity for altruism (and other actions we consider 'moral') come directly from our evolution as a social animal. If goblins had a different evolutionary path (as my character believed) their morals would not be coherent with ours. The actions of goblins showed their societal instincts weren't -in anyway- "moral." They were -genetically- an "evil" race, as the system the DnD characters find themselves in defined such terms as 'good' and 'evil.' 

Since the DnD system has defined 'good' and 'evil,' within that system one can see goblins are inherently "evil." Thus, my character felt the wholesale slaughter of their races is not only morally justifiable, but a moral imperative.

Is genocide morally justifiable in these circumstances? </TEXT>

Trumps businessmen sense will actually be a detriment to him here. Did you know he suggested we should pay off our debt by declaring bankruptcy?

It would be especially bad for the US, because the stability of the dollar is one of the only reasons people invest in us.

	<TEXT>  Trump won't be able to do any more damage in 4 years than Hillary will.

If he could destroy the democratic party completely, that would be incredible.

I don't think we will be able to see eye to eye about what Bernie believes. He isn't trying to watch America burn "just 'cuz." I think it is clear he is doing what he feels is best for our great country, not for himself. That is the kind of man he is, not one that will follow pride into folly. He'll let the Republicans do that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would give him a lot of publicity, but Trump would be president. So, it would be pretty selfish of him to do it just for more fame. He's a civil servant, not a celebrity. So, he is doing what he feel is best for society, not what he feels is best for himself. That -IMO- takes more balls. </TEXT>

But, I think we might be talking past each other. I'm not pro-(*anygrouppromotingmurder*). Any group--religious or otherwise--that promotes murder I am against. But, Islam no more **inherently** promotes murder than Christians do just because their Holy Text says *"Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death."*

I don't feel there is sufficient evidence that a blanket persecution of Muslims would have a significant impact in mitigating murder. But--of course--I am saying countries should be doing everything they can to persecute *ISIS* members, just not Muslims in general.  </TEXT>

Let me be clear. Murder is not OK. Murderers are not OK. No one here is saying it is OK. I'm not saying it; you're not saying it. The argument isn't whether or not murder is acceptable. Murder is not acceptable.

The debate is over whether or not persecuting a subsection of the population would have a significant impact in mitigating this unacceptable practice.

	<TEXT> If you're going to get into a "fight to the death" with the police, they'll take your kid anyway after you die.

So, they'll still take your kid, only now you'll be dead and unable to get your kid back, ever. </TEXT>
