	<TEXT> The v20 is not a phone that is getting returned. And no corporate rep will particularly care about issues down the road it's not like that customer will only come to them or that the rep would even remember them a year later. 


What a corporate rep cares about is making money, wasting time selling a different phone or a pre-order phone are the opposite of that. 


And, when you get a phone shipped from corporate it ships in two days to the consumer, not 3-5 days for them to pick up (insinuating shipping to the store).  </TEXT>
