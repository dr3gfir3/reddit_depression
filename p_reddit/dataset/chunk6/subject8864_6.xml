	<TEXT> I got a BA in a useless degree unrelated to computer science.  So one day I just decided to open a book on R and started practicing.  Without job experience or a degree, I was able to get a data analyst job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe this view is overly simplistic.  Maybe there is something wrong with me.  But the pace at which any community changes is too slow for me.  It's like the civil rights movement.  Sure we passed laws and there was some social progress, 50 years ago compared to now?  Thats too slow!  An sure, gay marriage laws were passed, does that mean I still have to endure another 50 years of discrimination and hate?  No thanks.  I'd rather go back into the closet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tried online dating and going to my school's LGBT center, and all I've experienced is hateful comments for my sexual identity and my race.  

I feel I still have to follow a certain stereotype of what a gay man should be.  Sorry, I'm not a white gay male with a body like a Greek marble statue.  Nor do I feel the need to be almost naked in a rainbow of colors shouting queer chants at the top of my lungs.  

Beyond the internet, an LGBT center, and a bar, there really isn't a place where being queer doesn't have any strings attached.  I can't even have a civil conversation with someone LGBT over coffee in public unless I'm eye candy!

Do you guys feel this way?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure you guys see this question a lot, but is there a difference between a PhD/MS when recruiters look for a job?  Is it mostly just demonstrating your ability to program? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you everyone for your response from the previous posts.  It looks like I need to do something to get out of my depressive funk.

Do you define short term goals?  Long terms goals?  Is defining success too vague?  Or is it better just to focus on habits? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would feel depressed and lock myself in my room.  I have things to do, but I haven't been acting.  My therapist said I needed to do activities for the sake of my own desire, but I haven't found the will to do anything.

I feel depressed because I don't do anything, and as a coping mechanism I just stay in bed It's a ruthless cycle.I feel like I'm living a meaningless life.

I talked to a therapist this year, he said I'm too passive. I like ppl be judgemental towards me.  I also have an inner critic to pushes me too hard,  and I'm not really doing anything to satisfy myself, all my actions have been towards satifying other ppl.

It started two years ago, when I started graduate school.  I feel like after graduating college and going back home, I felt trapped.  Someone told me to just to something different each day.  But I can't even start to do anything.  Help! </TEXT>
