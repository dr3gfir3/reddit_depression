As citizens we really need to think twice about echoing the partisanship as these teams have proven time and time again to not really give a lick about the American people. There are exceptions on both sides of the aisle but man if we get caught up anymore in the sport congress will serve us even less no matter Red or Blue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well they hired Podesta's brothers firm so they were pretty close.

I see two big holes in the Russia/Trump narrative. 
First off they already hired the Podesta's to represent their interests. This is an actual exchange of money, to represent their interests....

Secondly, noone has investigated the DNC server besides crowdstrike, wtf? If we are going to be accusing people of treason shouldn't the authorities actually investigate the initial breach? If you look over the intelligence reports it is all; it looks like Russia, they used tools like Russia, Putin hates HRC....but they haven't even looked at the server. 

If there is an honest invesitgation the first thing should be to confirm it was actually Russia...you know besides what it seems like.

Podesta lobbying for Russia

	<TEXT> No I am basing it off of all of the reporting at the time, which was around how the Trump campaign was in over their head and needed an insider to do their Delegate math and ensure success at the convention. 

As far as trying to find reasons it didn't happen, that is impossible. I do not want to try to prove the negative, but rather want to examine the evidence available. Then after looking at the evidence discuss the possible holes in the conspiracy, or how the evidence strengthens the conspiracy. 

I am currently in the camp that there is a lot of smoke and no fire. So I wanted to sort through the smoke, in the politics sub with other interested people.

Unfortunately it turns into an attack on my motives over a discussion. The Stone stuff actually gives us a chance to discuss this one piece of the puzzle without using platitudes or assumed conclusions....I thought.

Manafort is obviously someone with shady business with Russia and Ukraine, that does not automatically mean Trump does as well and by establishing the nature of his work with the campaign I think I can put that position on solid ground.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is it misdirection? I am not downplaying, I am making the case that Stone is a dead end for the collusion conspiracy. 

I think implying that Trump colluded with the Russians is counterproductive, especially when there are so many leaps of faith to get to the conclusion. I support and investigation so we can move on and if I end up being wrong it is something I want to know I am wrong about. 

So I am just trying to work through the evidence with people who I may disagree with, not misdirect or hand wave anything.

	<TEXT> I guess, Manafort definitely has some business with Russia that makes him look like a scumbag. But if we look back at when Manafort was brought on, he was the second campaign manager, it was all about his familiarity with the delegate process. 

During the campaign leading up to the convention there was so much delegate math going on and reporting about Trump pulling in an insider from previous Republican campaigns to help seal the delegate deal. He was not involved with the campaign before that, from what we see and was let go after the convention. 

I am not denying that Manafort did some shady shit in Ukraine, he did. But trying to make it seem like he was involved in some big conspiracy with the campaign is a stretch if we actually reflect on the role he played.

Either way I agree all this stuff should be investigated so we can move on because there are enough people who are suspicious it is getting in the way of progress. </TEXT>

Tell me, when Donald Trump speaks, do you believe every word of it? Even the shit he says that can be proven with a simple youtube search, with him saying the complete opposite? Just trying to get a grasp of the level of comprehention and bullshit detection here.

	<TEXT> 2) If Wikileaks did not know that Russia was providing the Podesta stuff and Stone spoke with Wikileaks then it does matter...how could it be collusion with Russia if they didn't know Russia was involved?

Also how could it be collusion of the Trump camp if they weren't even working with or talking to Stone? We are piling up degrees of separation here.

3) it matters because this is being used as part of the evidence. I think we know enough now about Stone and his involvement to stop referencing it as any sort of evidence. So let's move on to the next theory and find out more facts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Needing more information is true across the board. But at some point if actual information connecting Trump to Russia fails to materialize we will need to move on. As to Number 2:

SCHIFF: This is a question I think you can answer. Do you know whether the Russian intelligence service has dealt directly with WikiLeaks or whether they too used an intermediary?

COMEY: We assessed they used some kind of cutout. They didn't deal directly with WikiLeaks. In contrast to D.C. Leaks and Guccifer 2.0.

So they used a 'cut out', wikileaks may not have even known it was coming from Russia. Especially since Podesta fell for a phishing scam most likely.

As to Stone being a Trump associate, or part of the Trump cadre, it has been reported and addressed by Spicer that Stone actually has very limited contact with Trump. His interview with Stephanopoulos yesterday shed a lot of light on how little is actually there down the Roger Stone road as far as the Trump/Russia narrative goes. </TEXT>

I have a question though for everyone who thinks Trump colluded with the Russians; Does Stone having communications with Assange's people mean he colluded with the Russians? By Comey's own testimony we know that Wikileaks did not work directly with the Russians.

Also is Stone communicating with Guccifer 2 long after the leaks actually came out evidence of Russian collusion?  </TEXT>

You can use your brain and think for yourself instead of relying on what other people tell you.

Either way you are misrepresenting things, like the Reince FBI story. I am not sure how you can tell me to look at the facts while so easily brushing aside the commentary of officials who are/were in postions to know.

	<TEXT> Thank you.

I don't have a good response yet because the article doesn't really provide examples, not that their wrong, but I am going to go deeper into this rabbit hole. I am sure it will be next to impossible to prove some sort of centralized effort to push social media posts, unless they were sloppy or we get a leak. 

I would be foolish to rule this out though, because we know there were American groups like Correct the Record doing the same thing.

You have sent me down a rabbit hole! 

Thanks again. </TEXT>

They reference poll numbers for Trump's messaging and proposed policies but they make the claim

Given recent developments, many voters may see Trump as more of a "Russia First" 

and do not provide polling data for this. This appears to be where the title comes from too, but again it is the one thing they say what voters think without any polling data. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an interesting article which does a good job of position Trump's proposals with counterpoints to those proposals. I think some of the criticism is nit picking, but that's just me. 

One criticism that I think is just plain wrong;

In his plan, Trump also calls for financial reforms to expand credit and support new job creation, including making it easier for African-Americans to get credit to start businesses. 

"Credit is debt," said Starsky. "The community is talking about building assets, you're talking about building more debt. Who benefits when you offer more credit? The banks. We've seen that story before," said Starsky, referring to the housing boom when blacks and Latinos were the prime targets of subprime loans. 

If we want to push more Black owned businesses they need funding. While Credit is debt, to start a business it is often required and ensuring that Black entrepreneurs have access to credit is critical. 

What I like about Trump's proposals in his New Deal for Black America is that it is all about creating opportunity. He spoke at length about growing the Black middle class and ensuring opportunity for inner cities. 

One criticism I am not sure i followed was;

Trump also called for a "tax holiday for inner city investment," which Melina Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles and an organizer for the Los Angeles Black Lives Matter chapter, called "code for gentrification." She said such tax holidays allow investors to build amenities that typically attract mostly wealthier, white residents, thereby pushing poorer, working class people of color further away from city centers. 

I think the idea behind the incentives would be to create more jobs in the inner cities, but the criticism seems to say that it will only increase the cost of living in those areas? Anyone with more depth of knowledge about 'gentrification' that can school me about this? Do you think tax incentives for inner city investment will hurt the inner city residents?

All in all this is one of the best things I think Trump proposed during the campaign, he honestly seems to want to help grow the Black middle class in America and to help create opportunity for poor inner city inhabitants. I personally think this should be a chief priority for the country, anyone else?

	<TEXT> The opening paragraph

The White House tweeted Monday that the directors of the FBI and the National Security Agency told Congress Russia did not influence the 2016 presidential election. But to borrow a phrase from the administrations own parlance, thats actually fake news.


The tweet linked

https://twitter.com/potus/status/843865267008655360

The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process. 


The article does not address the actual words of the tweet. This may not be malicious but it should have been caught in editing I would think. The tweet talks about the electoral process and links a video of the questions from Nunes about vote tampering. 

Trump may have 'misrepresented' the exchange, I don't think so although I understand the criticism, but if that's the case this article falls under the same criticism for misrepresenting the tweet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is an interesting article about his conflicts of interests. I believe he pledged to give foreign money from his hotels to the treasury? I agree there can be potential for a conflict of interest, which is bad. The article does point out though that legally he is not required to divest from his business interests. It is a sticky widget no doubt, and while it is unique in the specifics to Trump, conflict of interest is not an issue Trump alone faces. So when we compare him to establishment Dems we see conflict of interest pop up especially with his former competitor, the establishment Dem Hillary Clinton.

For my point about trusting him more than establishment Dems, I stand by my position. 

Trump's twitter is an incredible openness that we can see on full display, whether he is right or wrong. And i appreciate that openness, i also do not expect someone to be right all the time.

We can disagree, that's fine with me. I like disagreements and think they are healthy in political discussion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What corruption has occurred in the last 60 days? 

I am not going to defend Trump University, there is no point in trying. I don't think total blame lays with Trump for it, but man putting his name on it was a bad move no doubt.

I think he said he would release the returns when the audit is up? Either way I don't care about his returns, although I was shocked at how much he paid in 2005...I was expecting 0 not 38 million.

Still, despite Trump U, he is more trustworthy than establishment Dems. Establishment Dems is actually too vauge maybe? Ron Wyden is a good rep and I respect him. 

I like transparency from all our elected officials for sure, Trump included. I think he is unpresidently open about what he thinks, and maybe that gets him in trouble because he is immediately called a liar. I personally like that we have a President whose public statements and appearances are not some manufactured event. I am loving the twitter Presidency.

As an aside, can we all just agree to use unpresidented from now on without having someone correct the spelling? </TEXT>
