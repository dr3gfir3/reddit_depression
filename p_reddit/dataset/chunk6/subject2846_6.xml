	<TEXT> Look. I understand your point. I understand your argument. I agree that empirical evidence is king. I agree that the big bang happened. I agree with almost all of your argument. But you cannot discredit someone's argument because of your own belief. Let's stress that.

Just because you don't believe in some form of deity, does not mean that it does not exist. Science does nothing to disprove the existence of a creator or diety. 

The absence of knowledge shouldn't not immediately point to diety. But not acknowledging the possibility makes your just as foolish as I.

Things do happen randomly. Quantum physics is right. I don't think anyone is jumping at every single random occurrence and pointing their fingers at it claiming some higher power is responsible. But perhaps some things can be the work of a diety and some things cannot.

There is grey area here. You cannot deal absolutely with something that bases itself in uncertainty.

Also, it appears from your comment history that you are a prick. Copy pasta is great. Have a nice night. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha you got me. Perhaps it isn't the correct choice of words. God exists unbound by time, in the sense that time is insignificant in His existence. 

I like to compare his existence to the scene inside the black hole in interstellar. It isn't that time doesn't exist, it is that it ceases to exist in the linear form that we view it. It becomes more like a book with infinitely many pages, where each page has some defined time, and that can be flipped through in any combination of ways possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree!

One of the biggest pitfalls of religious believers is the lack of accepting things that appear to contradict their own views. In my own personal opinion, you cannot hold religion and science apart as two separate things. I think they are two things that are part of a greater whole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that your argument can be countered in the same fashion. We can say that we don't know what was happening at the time of the big bang and thus the possibility of a creator exists. You are limiting your view of the creator as a traditional judeo- Christian Ood who directly intervenes for his people all the time. 

While ai am a Christian, my view is more that God intercede only when he needs to, but generally let's the world play out as if there was no design. He set parameters (ie defining the laws of physics, gravity. Etc) and just let it play out over billions and billions of years. There would be small examples of intercession (the first living cell) which could also just be that anything that can happen will eventually happen. There are small pokes along the way to keep life progressing to the state he wants it, but generally it is just the universe acting upon itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. I think life in of itself is strange. The whole formulation of life is so strange. That in a giant sea of water and organic molecules, life sort of just popped into existence one day is really weird, in that something just became alive and then reproduced. 

It is all good though. Existing is just strange. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first question is not super clear, but im assuming you are talking about polygamy. I'm not going to try and defend polygamy. I think that every single person makes really bad mistakes and that this was one of them for him, which is why we don't practice it today, and why it was repealed. And I don't know what exactly you are referring to when you say that this plane of existence is based on sexual behavior.

Aso for tithes, which I assume you are referring to. Everything on this earth costs money. You really can't do anything without it, whether it be a creation of man or God. So things like building churches, giving humanitarian relief, building temples, and the upkeep, of each of these things costs money. Tithing, 1/10th of what I earn, goes to taking care of God's kingdom on earth. We don't have any paid clergymen, so I'm not paying a salary to anyone. Merely giving back a portion of what God has given me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. I would postulate that life is abundant in our universe and that the great expanse of it all is really all part of the greater plan. While we may never make contact, it is ridiculous to assume we are the only beings alone on one rock in an almost infinitely big universe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mormon here, we actually have doctrine that explains this in a way.

As mortals, we notice time, and we measure it. As a God, He has no time. He moves through the iterations of earth as if it were a filing system. Meaning He can be omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. 

Further, human life has always existed on a plane outside of what we know, that would be matterless. We existed as intelligences, or unorganized spirit. God organized our intelligences into what would be a spirit, and then taught us more.

Without going into a very long spiel, we are the way we are, and have choices to believe or not, because ultimately, to have the choice and to choose to do good qualifies us for Godhood, and that in the same way our creator created us and his multiple children, we will also have the opportunity to do so given that we qualify.

If you wanted to know more PM me. It goes really deep, but is one of the more satisfying answers to the questions of my soul. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Por que no los dos?

In my personal opinion, God is an author and creator, but not particularly an interventionist. I do believe we are his children and will intervene slightly, but for the most part he just sets parameters for the universe and lets it exist. 

Another thing, I don't think humans are the only intelligent life in the universe and that the God of our World is actually the God of many worlds, with such massive distances between us that we would need faith to believe rather than just comparing notes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for a nice gaming rig. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-25 06:16:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* I want to run games like Skyrim, Civ V and Civ VI, as well as some FPS games without any lagging on high.Eventually it would be cool to run VR as it gets less expensive.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* .Less than $800, I have to talk the missus into this.

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Within the next few months. Im not looking for cutting edge, i just want to run games the way they were supposed to be played. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* Everytihng except a monitor.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* Im in Utah. so no.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I have a 22 inch 1080pmonitor, but will also be using my tv as a screen which is 4k.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* I think the answer to this is yes? I really dont want to make any major changes for the next few years, this is a big purchase and it will be tough enough to justify it to the wife.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* Enough RAM and a SSD to keep me from ever waiting or dropping below 60+ fps

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Keep it as plain jane as possible. Black is just fine. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* Its possible, but my university might offer it free. I have also thought about running Linux. I think Windows 10 home would be good though

**Extra info or particulars:**
I know this was probably super vague, but im not trying to be too crazy. I want a system that runs fast, and plays well, without too much of a hit to the pockets. I dont need cutting edge anything, but i would the possibility to play games for the next few years without needing a major revamping. VR is optional, if it drives the price up quite a bit.

Thank you kind sirs! </TEXT>

The problem isn't the road home as much as that area just being a hub for drugs and other homeless people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I will see if I can give you some answers.

1. The classes are pretty standard and in all honesty it depends on what you are studying. There are some classes you can coast through, and others that will take all you've got, even in generals.

2. I have yet to not get a class I want, and that was with forgetting I needed to register until 3 weeks before school started. Some classes will accept more students, others have smaller numbers. Take it as you wish.

3. Most every professor I have had has office hours, and if you can't make those, you can make an appointment with them to talk. Besides that, there are TAs that are always willing to help, and tutoring centers in a lot of the buildings. 

4. It's just like signing up for it again. Try not to fail though, classes are expensive!

And for your other 4.

1. Football games- crazy. Everything going else- no clue. I think it depends on the events, but it would be safe to say there is a decent student turn out for pretty much have everything.

2. How naturally inclined are you to make friends? People here are friendly, if you put forth the effort!

3. Honestly, I'm not sure.

4. The housing around here is pretty crazy! You will have to find a spot early on to secure it, and it might cost a pretty penny too. On campus is nice if you are single or in a single family sort of deal, they have housing for all types!

All in all, I love the U. I am more and more amazed every day at just how great this school is. I am a transfer, and I thought college just sucked, and then I transferred here and I could not be happier. You will have a great time if you decide to come here. I promise you that! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, the teaching is excellent. I feel like I'm getting a stellar education with professors who are really at the forefront of their fields. 

Secondly, the atmosphere is great. Everyone is super friendly, there are tons of clubs and ways to meet new people, and the physical location is awesome too. 

You have great facilities, the University is updating a lot of the older buildings which is really nice, and they have an awesome gym that all students have access to. 

Besides that, Salt Lake is a great place to live. Mormons aren't half as bad as people make them out to be, and generally are pretty friendly. The bar scene down here is pretty impressive too, and so is the eating scene.

Basically, you will find no shortage of awesome things to do here and at the university. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno, i can feel the melodrama in it. I think of it more as a critique of life and the problems that fame has brought with it. Perhaps a celebration, but only in very small proportions, compared to the rest of the album.

 I feel a depressed and self loathing Kanye, who is jaded by the influence of fame on his personal life, from the relationship with his wife, to the family members he feels obligated to keep on the payroll, even though they dont even see him as their relative, but more as a paycheck.

EDIT: Among other things </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Velveeta Mac and cheese with homemade 5 bean chili. Tasty, easy to make. You can also do kraft. Whichever you think tastes better. 

Another good one that I make is cheeseburger rice. Brown your hamburger, season it however you want (I use garlic salt, onion powder, black pepper. Season after you have drained the fat.) , don't drain the fat off unless you are using 80/20 beef. Then throw the rice in and season it a little more to make sure it stays flavorful (I usually add a little ketchup and mustard here to give it some zing.). Add water to cook the rice and let it simmer until the rice is done. Add cheese to top it off. I like to add bacon and pickles before I top it with cheese.

I have made curried chicken Ramen as well, that one is pretty easy, but kinda hard to explain because I made the broth from scratch. I can figure it out and send it to you if you would like. 

Biscuits and gravy takes like 20 minutes. Top them with some fried eggs for added protein. 

Jambalaya is actually easy as well. Buy some andoille sausage, cut up some chicken breast, and add some shrimp if you would like as well. Melt butter in a skillet, and add some chopped onions, bell peppers and celery. Cook until they are browned. Add Cajun seasoning, I use tony chacheres. It will look really dark and smell really strong, but it gets watered down. Add shrimp, then chicken, then sausage. Let them all cook, then add the rice and a little bit more  seasoning. Brown the rice for like 1 minute, then add the water needed to cook the rice. Let it simmer until the water is gone. Notes on this, you can add crushed red pepper if you would like spicy, but the heat on this dish is already pretty high.

Fajita skillets are nice. Season your chicken, and let it sit for a few minutes while you prepare the pan. Add oil, then cook bell peppers, onions until they are softish, then add the meat. You will want the meat to be cooked through when you add the rice. Brown the rice with the spices and maybe add a little more oil if the pan seems dry. Add the water to cook the rice and let simmer. Serve over lettuce or by itself.

A brazilian dish I like to make is stroganoff. It is a little different than normal stroganoff and is in almost no way healthy, but it is really good. Add oil to the pan and get some garlic and onions cooking. Cube your chicken or just use canned shredded chicken. Cook it and season with salt and pepper. Add one little can of tomato paste, add a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. Get that all cooking and hot. You can add something to give it some zest like sriracha or Cayenne, but the dish is generally mild. You can add frozen corn if you want.

 Here is where it gets unhealthy and delicious. You will want to add cream until the sauce is thoroughly orange pink. Pinker has more of a cream taste, the more orange is a stronger tomato taste. You will need to salt this to your liking. Then just cook a pot of rice and eat this over it. Generally you will put shoestring potatoes over it, but they are hard to find, so I use ruffles, but the meal is just as good without them.

All of the rice I use is parboiled. It is healthier than white rice, and takes less time to cook than brown rice. If these seem kind of hard to understand, let me know and I can explain a little further. </TEXT>
