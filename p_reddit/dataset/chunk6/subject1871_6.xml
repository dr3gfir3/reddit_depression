	<TEXT> Thats what i mean. Sometimes Frost, Kapkan and other ops who need to setup stuff outside don't have time to reinforce the Objective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Roamers and Trappers may not have the time time to reinforce during prep phase or maybe roamers just wanna get out of the Obj room. This leaves a breachable hatch or wall that can easy be breached giving the attackers and additional entry point possibly costing the game.

Give defenders the option the drop their Reinforced wall to allow other operators to pick them up and put them to use.

Comment if this is a good or bad idea.

Edit: Attackers cannot pick them up (Duh). </TEXT>
