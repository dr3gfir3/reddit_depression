	<TEXT> I cant be covered on his anymore after July 1. Well I can but it will be a PPO but we would have to pay over $400 a month for just my coverage. So its better for me to get my own coverage at my work. The HSA is just the savings account to pay for any medical expenses for our high deductible health plan.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This summer due to a change in our insurance I will be covered on my own individual HDHP and my husband will be covered under his own HDHP. I have heard we can't each have our own HSA's. Is that true? Can we have one individual HSA and use it to pay for expenses for both of us. I ask this because my employer will match to a certain point what I put into the account but his doesnt.  </TEXT>
