Went to the closest liquor store that was still open that late and there were only 2 people in the store - cashier and some buddy of his just standing around chatting. Asked for condoms and the cashier turned around to get them; buddy grins and yells, "Someone's gonna git some Vitamin P tonight!" Walked out feeling like a boss and never worried about buying condoms again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ship's speed is measured in knots because it used to be measured by heaving a weighted wooden panel over the side. Tied to the panel was a rope which had the other end secured to the ship. The rope had evenly spaced knots and one sailor would count the knots that passed over his fingers while another watched a 30 second sand timer. When the time was up, they recorded the count of knots.

Even more fun fact. The error of doing this vs true nautical miles per hour was about 1.5%.

	<TEXT> One of my favorite runs ever was back in TBC but with a new-ish toon, a warlock. Wanted to run Scarlet Monastery but having trouble finding a group. Hanging out in UC, someone said they were looking for 1 more, must be pet class. So I asked for an invite.

Turns out it was a group of 4 hunters. So, using hunter pets and VW as tanks and them self healing their own pets and me doing a health funnel on my VW, we proceed to wreck Lib and Arm; didn't try Cath because we were all sub-40. 

Good hunters are awesome; but for every good one, there's at least two that think it's just "Send in pet, Arcane, autoshot, Feign Death if my pet dies." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one in this world, so far as I know  and I have searched the records for years, and employed agents to help me  has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people. Nor has anyone ever lost public office thereby.

 - [H.L. Mencken](http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2011/09/no-one-ever-went-broke-underestimating.html)

But this is usually paraphrased as "No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the average American" or similar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fellow WAtonian here. Can confirm that 1st gram I bought legally was over $30 and I had to drive to Bellingham to get it because Cannabis City always sold out while I was still in the line.

But my last buy was for edibles so I got an ounce of shake for $100.  </TEXT>
