	<TEXT> **Note:**
The quote is "It's future rust and it's future dust" from the lyrics in *Spanish Sahara* from one of the endings.

Here is an explanation of my lyrics tattoo:

I used the The Action Will Have Consequences font on it :) I decided to add the butterfly mostly to signify my love for this game and the characters. And it also represents the consequence of my actions and for it to be a constant reminder. </TEXT>
