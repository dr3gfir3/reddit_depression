	<TEXT> Without a doubt, Michael Cimino's 'Heaven's Gate'.

It's an American epic on a scale not seen before or since, or likely ever again, Heaven's Gate is an unfairly maligned masterpiece. Running a colossal 219 minutes, the film is bursting with spectacular visuals, impressive technical work, and a collection of great performances from the likes of Kris Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert, Christopher Walken, and Jeff Bridges.

This film look absolutely stunning. Cimino makes use of light, shadows, dust, and smoke to create some of the most gorgeous shots ever put to film. Sunlight pokes through shutters, windows, and the tops of trees to cast beautiful streams of light across the frame. Clouds roll in, casting everything in shadow before moving on. Dust kicked up by horses and carriages swirls across the landscapes. Smoke billowing off trains, homes, and buildings engulf entire shots. The kinetic movement of the camera flawlessly matches the energy of the scenes it depicts. This is the West as you've never seen it before.


Depicting Johnson County War, a rarely-acknowledged tragedy of American history, Heaven's Gate is uncompromising in its portrayal of brutal violence and shameful corruption. The story is ultimately bleak, but presents the full range of human emotion throughout its run time.

Heaven's Gate is big in just about every possible way. How many extras hired, how many costumes sewn, how many horses used, how many buildings erected, how many languages spoken, how many days were spent making this film happen? Apparently enough to bankrupt United Artists, something for which this film lives in infamy. This bankrupting of the company, combined with the bleak story and the director's singular vision, resulted in the film's horrific reception. It was hacked down to two-thirds it's original length and subsequently crucified by critics. I can't imagine the film packing nearly as much power in such a shortened state. In its original, over three-hour form, however, Heaven's Gate stands tall among all epics of the cinema as the last of its kind, a neglected masterpiece gradually accumulating its due praise.


Edit: And honorary mention to Sergio Leone's final masterpiece 'Once Upon a Time in America'. People always talk about his westerns but I think that 'America' is his real masterpiece (or at least it ties with 'West'). It seems that even people who love Leone's westerns haven't often seen this masterpiece. Which is sad because I think that it might be even better than The Godfather.  </TEXT>
