	<TEXT> It's stories like this one that make me wanna lock the door to my room, even though I live with 3 other roommates, our front door can't be opened from the outside without a key, the main entrance door cannot be opened without a key as well, and even though there's a THIRD door to the whole yard of the block that gets locked during night time. I have no dogs. I dunno if I should be happy or scared about it! </TEXT>
