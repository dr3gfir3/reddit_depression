	<TEXT> Another thing, is the intense cold in the Sector E shed and underground area a preventative measure? Like, could they be keeping it cold because they have noticed the cold sort of lulls the animal (or organism, since we don't know what it is) into some sort of dormant state? Or is it because the organism needs the cold to survive?  </TEXT>
