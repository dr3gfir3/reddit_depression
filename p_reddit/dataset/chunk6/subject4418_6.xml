	<TEXT> Most do not have insurance through their employer. That's becoming rare these days. He said healthcare for everyone, he's not even close.

Nothing about Flynn being a foreign agent was fake news. Trump's tweet about Obama was fake news. Trump ties to a Russian bank are not fake news. At one time Russian banks were the only banks who would lend him money.

 I'll have to see 6 months of Trump numbers before I give him credit. He did not inherit a mess as he has claimed.

His potential to ruin the economy lies with his tariffs, a subject he has not yet acted on.

He can't go a day without telling a lie his followers suck right up.

Sessions is in serious trouble.

5 states are suing over the travel ban. Protests take place everyday and will continue to until this clown resigns.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am NOT a Liberal! How many times do I have to say that? Trump is alienating people fast. Coal miners who will never be able to get insurance. Police, who he claimed to support, have now found he's anti-union and against collective bargaining.

Obama is out enjoying himself, something he well deserves.

Many felt Trump would not do what he said when they voted for him are now upset. The Protests are real.
I attended 7 of them and I've never been to Obama's site, nor have any of the people who attended with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obama is about as involved in his site as Trump is in his. I doubt Trump's has even seen his site. Presidents have better things to do. If he wasn't unpopular there wouldn't be protests.

How did this site know he would fuck up the immigration bill? The protests were immediate. </TEXT>
