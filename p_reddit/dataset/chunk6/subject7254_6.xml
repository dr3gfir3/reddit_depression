If he killed me, I'm sure Goroth Man-Lover would have raped my corpse in 50 Shades of Grey fashion. 

Edit: First of all, it is not as amazing as I once thought. I confused this Uruk's name with a previous captain I killed right before him. I guess my sexy imagination made a false connection. Here's the link to the images.

	<TEXT> Ok, so seeing how they are making Zelda U an open world game (freaking awesome) I would like them to make combat a little more immersive than press B to swing your sword. 

I recently finished Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. A Lord of the Rings game on Xbox One. It was open world. It had a combat system like Batman Arkham City. You press X to attack and Y to counter. The bow was brought up with L Trigger and R Trigger to shoot. Stealth is used by holding R Trigger and X for a stealth kill. 

Very simple, yet complex combat. It flows very smoothly. I would truly enjoy it if Zelda U had something similar. Make combat so smooth that you can take on ten Bokoblins at once. Go on missions that require stealth. Mess stuff up with the bow (or boomerang, bomb, etc.) easily accessible and thrown/fired the same way.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It may not seem relevant to this sub at first, but just read the story. It's pretty good and not that long. 

So, like, I cadet teach 2nd graders my last hour of my school day (I'm a high school senior.)

They were all still doing things for valentines day. One girl comes up and tells me they were all playing a game. They write something on two pieces of paper. The first one is something that makes you happy. The second is something that makes you sad. They put it in a box, draw it out, read it, and guess who it was. I said I'd do it. 

When I get to the sad thing, I couldn't think of something, so I decided to be silly and make them laugh. I said, "I get sad when that one weird Orc used to beat me all the time in my video game." 

They all laughed when it was read out loud. Someone asked, "What Orc?"

I said, "His name was Feldush the Crazy."

I kid you not that one of the little boys said this super loud: "Feldushbag!"

I looked away like I had nothing to do with this. 

TL;DR: A 2nd grader read my inner most thoughts about Feldush the Crazy </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-02-10 22:52:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I met this one particular Uruk a while back. His name was Gham the Scholar. It was while I was hunting Warchiefs in Udun. Gham was a body guard for a Warchief I was hunting. I figured I needed to kill him to make killing the Warchief easier. So, I find him and we do our staredown thing. 

Now, as we are all aware, the Uruk always say something along the lines of, "Man Swine!" *Clash* "I'm gonna gut you to get a promotion."

Gham however said, "*GWAAAAH!*" *Clash* "Mgg... *MuwaaaaAAAAAAAAHHHHHHRRRRRGGGG!* Herm... Herm.."

He was one of those screamers. It was my first encounter with a screamer. I was taken aback. I paused the game once we disengaged and thought, "What the hell?" I remembered his nickname was the Scholar. Then it clicked. He's a moron! Who made him a captain? I ended up cracking up. 

My thought was that I really didn't want to kill him. I wished that I had the brand ability so I could make him a Warchief. Alas, Gham had to go. I killed him. Because someone as stupid as him surely would have messed up my assassination of the Warchief. 

Any other memorable Uruks? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm. That's interesting. Something similar happened to me. I was hanging from a ledge. Captain walks by with his buddies. I attracted his buddies to me and one by one stealth ledge killed all of them. Bodies littering the ground below me. Then I did the same to the captain </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've so far: 

-Thrown a captain into an abyss
-Eaten a captain with a Graug
-Raised an army of lesser Uruks and simply watched them tear a Warchief apart
-Put a Warchief against a Warchief
-Branded all the archers in an area and roughly half the lesser Uruks and started an all out war
-When I see an Uruk laughing about the kick a slave off a cliff, I sneak up and kick the Uruk off
-Set *EVERYONE* ablaze
-Poisoned *so* many captains
-Branded everyone in a fort then dispatched them. It was a flurry of exploding heads. 
-My crowing achievement: Stormed a Fort with a Graug, shot down all the hanging meat, dominated the Caragors, and shot down all the Morgai Fly nests. 

As you can tell, I enjoy Chaos. I find the game is just fun. There is an endless abundance of ways to kill Uruks and monsters. What is your most creative kill? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before I went to church this morning, I made sure I had a couple of ones in my wallet for the collection basket. Collection basket came, put a dollar in. Easy peesy. 

I go to Walmart afterwards to get some stuff. Get to the check out. Look through my wallet for my $100 bill to pay. Had that $100 bill because my grandfather paid me back yesterday with it for buying some bleacher seats from my school for him. 

It wasn't in my wallet. Cue "Dafuq?" Face. I notice I had two ones but no $100 bill. 

You gotta be kidding me. 

Paid with debit card. Left Walmart. I hate ADHD. 

TL;DR: At least I'm going to Heaven...

EDIT: So, if you're here to comment and say that God isn't real, or religion is stupid, please kindly leave. Whatever you believe is fine. Not here to convert you. I'm fine with any of you being an atheist. I respect that. Please do the same for me. 

There is a difference between being Atheist and hating religion. Atheist means you don't believe in God or any gods. You choose not to believe in a supernatural force and instead accept science as the only reality. Perfectly fine. Many religious people, Christian or not, also believe in science. 

Hating religion is just that. Hating religion. It's being as closed minded as they accuse religious people of being. Going out of your way to convince people to stop believing in what makes them happy is not ok.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hitmontop in Omega Ruby has movement very similar to Capoeira. Capoeira is a Brazilian Martial Art that was developed by slaves when they weren't allowed to learn how to fight. So, the slaves drew from their African background and developed a "dance" instead. 

The dance involves many spinning kicks. The whole art revolves around spinning and circular movements. 

Just something very interesting I just noticed. Hitmonchan is based on a boxer, and Hitmonlee is based on a kickboxer. However, I never knew about Hitmontop's origins till just this moment.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I was over at my buddy's place, playing Alien. I got the short end of the stick and ended up having to test drive the new Nightmare difficulty setting. Well, after hiding in a room for about 30 minutes, I found my balls and entered the corridor. My friend said, "Pause!"

I pause. "What?"

"It's behind you."

"It can't be!"

"I think I heard something."

I heard nothing, and I had the headphones on set loudly enough that I could hear everything. And the room I'd just come from only had one entrance. Not even a vent. We all decided my friend was just paranoid. But I said I would turn around and check for him. 

I unpaused. Turned, and nothing. 

I turned back to the corridor. And...

THE ALIEN WAS RIGHT FUCKING THERE!

"Gotcha!" Says the alien as he chews off my face. 

There was no way the Alien could have been there. The corridor was straight and reasonably lit. No obstacles to hide behind. No vents. No other doorway. I couldn't even hear him approaching. 

My friends and I have come to the conclusion that the Xenomorph can teleport on Nightmare mode. It's the only explanation we could come up with. Can anyone else come up with a better one? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! Some awesome tips here!

As for the lighter weight class fighters note you made, yeah, that is probably partially why I haven't developed that kind of power. I doubt I'm going to gain a whole lot of weight. I've been lifting intensely for a while, eating well, etc. still not gaining weight. Only power and speed. And I'm cool with that. I fight very well at my current weight. 

And yeah, you don't see that kind of power often in lighter fighters, but when you do, they're monsters. Cub Swanson for example. He's a UFC Featherweight. He's knocked someone out so hard the mouthpiece flew out of his mouth. Featherweight is 145 lbs, they usually cut 10-20 lbs. So he's roughly my weight and was capable of doing that. 

The way I see it, if I'm able to knock people out with my hands the way I can with my kicks and potentially my knees and elbows, that's just one more (or two, however you look at it) tool I have in my arsenal. 

Thanks again! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The only knockouts I've ever gotten were via head kick. I've never done it, but I'm also certain I could knock people out with elbows and knees. 

I want to build that kind of power in my hands too. I have proper technique when throwing punches (but let's face it, it can *always* get better), I have very fast hands. I can land several punches in a row before jumping out of harm's way. But they lack a certain devastating effect that could end a fight. I've knocked the wind out of people before, but I'm just not certain I have the power I'm looking for yet. 

Any exercises for building that kind of power?
