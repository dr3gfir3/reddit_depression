	<TEXT> Hey guys I was wondering if it was worth making stencil art for each faction. I'll probably end up posting the designs on my red bubble for anyone that wanted to rep irl. 


Please post suggestions. I have a few funny tin cans designs sketched out already, but need suggestions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I tend to be a very loyal person, so when I joined the Samurai and started using Knights I had to justify it in my mind.

So, I basically ended up creating a short story that centered around a female warden turned samurai.

After seeing countless civilians fall to the hands of the warring factions, a nameless warden chose to renounce her sword for two blades. Now a peacekeeper, the women roamed the world protecting the innocent from all the factions. It was during her travels on the warfront border between the samurai and vikings that she protected a young samurai child from the vicious throwing axe of a beserker. Wounded and dying the peacekeeper was taken in by a samurai family and trained in the ways of the Orochi, so that she could protect everyone. 

(except for the vikings)
