"The Good

An absurd world with equally bonkers characters.
New combat styles shake things up.
Wonderful presentation of a melodramatic crime drama.

The Bad

The main campaign is slightly tame for a Yakuza.
Might be too much watching and not enough playing for some.

The Ugly

Women are relegated to roles that involve being killed, kidnapped, or ogled in some mini-games.

	<TEXT> At some point, I think that we have to stop thinking about it as a backlog. 

Time is now the major limit on playing games, not money. A backlog implies that I intend to complete all those games, which will never happen because new games will come out, never mind other forms of entertainments like movies and TV series.

To me, the question is: what do I want to play right now? What do I want to experience? 

Just because I bought a game at some point, it doesn't mean that I'm actually going to play it, even though that was no doubt my intention at the time. Set your priorities and forget about all those other games in your library. </TEXT>

But this is kind of misleading since the median US household income was a [bit higher in 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#/media/File:US_Real_Household_Median_Income_thru_2014.png). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I still prefer vanilla. 

Noble Skyrim looks amazing in many places, but I don't like the fancy floor tiles they used for High Hroghart for example. It doesn't fit the theme. Same complaint for the Markarth floor. Or the rounded stones used on the Solitude house wall which look fake and out of place to me. 

The vanilla moss covered wooden pillar is the best looking out of the three.

Skyrim 2017 has a couple of fairly ugly textures, like that Solitude moss covered floor which looks toxic.

As for landscapes, Skyrim would need a complete geometry rework to bring it up to modern standards. I don't feel like the texture packs can improve it that much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That would be a bit too real. I don't think that players would be comfortable with that. It's a game after all, not a simulation of reality. Games don't show many things about war, like collateral damage, PTSD, disabling/maiming injuries and medevacs. It's perhaps better that way.

That being said, Counterstrike had a VIP mode. The Virtua Cop games had some civilians pop in randomly. GTA obviously has civilians. So, there are examples. Arma features some civilians. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The part about history books was interesting:

"The Cheese and the Worms is interesting because it's about this miller who had really wild personal religious beliefs, strange cosmological beliefs; he thought the world was formed out of cheese and the worms ate through the cheese and became angels, and like all these other things. He's just a miller, and he has these very in-depth thoughts that he probably got by talking to people traveling just because the area he lived in was very well-traveled. He was brought up on charges I think three times and eventually executed for heresy. But what I think is interesting about it, is it shows that even simple people, even peasants, could have actually very deep sort-of ideas and thoughts about the nature of reality and the nature of world, god, the afterlife as opposed to this idea that they're all ignorant and the Church kinda defines everything, and that's all there is. So The Cheese and the Worms is very fascinating.

The Night Battles by the same author is also very interesting because it's about an Agrarian cult, the benandanti, and they are the welfarers, because that's what it means. They were born with a call, and that means they were designated to become these mystic warriors. During certain times of the year, they would enter into dream battles with witches and it was believed that if they won, then their crops would be saved and if they failed, it'd spoil the crops. They were Christian, but when Inquisitors found out about what they were doing, they were like "No, this sounds kinda like you're witches" and they actually convinced the benandanti that they were witches and they were like "Oh wow, you got us." So that's a very interesting thing."

H"ere's one more I read through recently, I think it's called By Sword and Fire by Sean McGlynn and the subtitle is Cruelty and Atrocity in Medieval Warfare. It kind of looks at the aspects of brutality in warfare and how often they were less about being insanely cruel and more about being practical. Like, sieges were very horrible and some of the things that happened during sieges were unbelievably awful, but they had a very specific strategic purpose. Also, a lot of the things that seem really brutal and bloody were done for very specific expedient purposes. Like say, for example, the Battle of Agincourt, at the end of the battle, Henry V ordered the execution of a huge number of captured French soldiers, which is pretty gnarly, until you look at the details and realize all these captured soldiers, who outnumbered them by the way, still had their armor on, were not far away from their weapons, and there was a group of French cavalry that had regrouped and was going to attempt to storm their camp. And so Henry said "Sorry, kill 'em, there's no way we're going to let these guys come in here and retake all their buddies who are still ready to fight." It's horrible, but I guess it's interesting to look through and see how this was the norm, almost everyone engaged in it, usually successful people. For example, King John of England: generally felt as a bad and cruel king. Richard I, he's the greatest, he's the paragon of chivalry, except that he did all these brutal things, but he was victorious. And so we kinda forget about all those horrible, cruel things he did."

"there's a great book by Ken Woodward called Making Saints and it's about how the process of people becoming saints in the public consciousness has changed over the centuries and really it moved from something that was very much a local cult, because they used the term cult of the saint, and then later the Church is like "Hold on, there's a lot of people becoming saints we can't quite keep track of, we're not really sure if they're real or if they were pagans or a dog" in the case of Saint Guinefort which was a very interesting case in France where the story was, a snake had come into the Lord's baby's room, the dog killed the snake, and the Lord ran in and saw blood and the baby crying and killed the dog, and then the servant came in and realized the dog saved the baby, and they buried it and oh, the Church tells us that martyrs are saints. And so St. Guinefort is a dog, whoops, the Church didn't like that.

So the more the Church became involved, then the hagiographies became a means of confirming or documenting the true and verified miraculous properties of this person. Because the Church developed more and more criteria, like okay, it can't just be some guy who's really cool from your area that you celebrate on a certain feast day, like they have to perform miracles, they have to have done this and done that and so over time hagiographies had to check certain boxes for the Church. And they used to go to the, I'm going to get the term wrong, but basically Devil's Advocate which was a real position in the Church, because the Devil's Advocate would say "Okay, I'm going to tear this apart. You say this guy's a saint, I say no, this can be disproved, this isn't true" and so on. And after it got past the Devil's Advocate, it'd go to the Pope for official canonization, put 'em in a book, put 'em on a calendar, they're ready to go. I think a lot of that stuff is really fascinating, especially seeing how over time it changed from something that was a populist thing where all you had to do was say, and eventually the Church is like "Yeah, yeah, these guys have been around for a long time, of course we recognize them as a saint" to being something like "No, no, not until the Pope actually says, you have to go through this very regimented process."" </TEXT>

it's not much of a challenge if you're able to be perfect at everything

It takes a long time to level all the skills. Challenge in Skyrim is pretty much set by the player. The game can be as easy or as hard as you want. I don't see this as a big problem. If you want to level all the skills, you'll be investing a lot of time into the game.

	<TEXT>  I would never buy a $60 game under any circumstances.

Why not if it provides you enough entertainment? How much do you spend per year on luxuries, such as nice clothes, movies, travel, restaurants etc.? Could you really not afford to spend $60 on a game?

According to [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/very-sad-graph-how-much-americans-have-left-to-spend-after-essentials-today/260606/), a middle class American has $14,400 per year in disposable income. So, for that person, not wanting to spend $60 on a game that will entertain him for dozens if not hundreds of hours is being cheap. </TEXT>

No one of course. Some games are so bad that no one will even download them for free. But I don't see how that's relevant to games that are valuable.

I really don't need to pirate games.

But you still do? Why? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's look at it another way. 

Say a game takes 1M hours of work to make, and each of these hours cost $100 on average. The cost of making the game is $100M.

Who pays for this? If everyone pirates the game, the studio will not get any money. Of course, people will get to enjoy that game anyway (unless it's multiplayer), but then the studio would close and, if that were the general situation, no new games would ever get produced, except by hobbyists working in their spare time.

So you might not feel that you're doing any harm, but if everyone thinks like you, then the games industry will collapse and cool games will not get made. 

I don't know about your personal situation, but many people who pirate have the money to afford buying the games they play. They pirate a game and then go spend $600 on fashionable clothes or $100 on a meal at a fancy restaurant. They could have spent part of that disposable income on the games they spend hundreds of hours playing instead. </TEXT>

I totally agree. It's a problem on all subs, but even moreso here. The downvote button is used to say "I disagree" when it's supposed to be for uninteresting or low effort comments. This leads to the sub being a huge circlejerk. There's almost no indie game coverage for example.

	<TEXT> (I hope this is OK now. I had previously linked to the comments section)

My take is that this not the end of the world. Android/Apple products, as well as gaming PCs already have an incremental upgrade approach.

Also, some console generations have lasted about as long. The original Xbox was released in 2001, and the Xbox 360 came only 4 years later in 2005. The 3 years gap between the PS4 and PS4 pro is a bit shorter than the average console generation, but it's not that big of a difference. Last gen was the outlier, with consoles lasting from 2005-2006 until 2013 (7-8 years).

Incremental upgrades make more sense now because the basic tech is a lot more stable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I can't name a single character or story beat in Crysis. 

Prophet? Island freezing over?

I think Crysis 1 had a decent story. I liked the horror movie vibe at the start of the game and the huge buildup, with a more introspective alien spaceship sequence. Also, the open levels were really fun to play.

But Crysis 2 was a poor followup from a narrative standpoint. They had decent ideas, but the story was confusing. I wasn't sure of who I was and why I was doing things. Why does prophet give you his suit? Who are these  CELL bad guys? How do all the bad guys fit together CELL+Infection+Aliens? And how did we get from the end of Crysis 1 (alien invasion from frozen island) to the start of Crysis 2? This is apparently explained in comic books that no one read. They just did an incredibly poor job from a narrative standpoint. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What makes the game special is that each level is really well crafted, and is made kind of like a [diorama](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/68/1f/b3/681fb383f4710e0c767814d068da6157.jpg). There are plenty of little stories that are told throughout the level. 

The point of the game isn't just to kill your target, but to find all of the ways that you could use to kill him, and also to explore the world. 

One interesting aspect is that you're not constantly shooting everyone, but also blending into the world and observing it from the inside, or even playing a role if only for a brief moment (e.g. being a "sushi chef").

I would love to see a "historical" version of the game, where you travel back to the past, maybe using the pretext of a virtual reality training exercise. It could be awesome to go back to relive a scene from the past, kind of like the movie ["Russian Ark"](https://youtu.be/ZV1kphEEXn8?t=11s) which takes you inside the Hermitage palace in Russia in the 19th century (I think?). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I looked at old reviews for fun:

"You might think that a game like Neverwinter Nights probably isn't very healthy for the gaming industry. After all, this is the sort of game you could easily play for months or even longer. Simply put, once you get into Neverwinter Nights, you'll likely have no need or desire to play another role-playing game for a long time--or any other game for that matter. And while that's unfortunate for any game trying to compete, it's certainly a good thing as far as most gamers should be concerned. They'll find that Neverwinter Nights is indeed the end-all, be-all Dungeons   Dragons RPG that it's been touted to be for the last several years. " - Greg Kasavin from Gamespot

"Neverwinter Nights is undoubtedly one of the most highly-anticipated games of this year. After five years in development, the game is finally done, and to the delight of RPGers around the world, Bioware hasn't left us disappointed. If the shear size of this five-page review scares you, then you'll be happy to know that Neverwinter Nights is good, very good, even brilliant in some aspects. There hasn't been a night for the past week and a half that I haven't stayed up to well into the night (and early, early morn') beating orcs, minotaurs, and hobgoblins -- and I've enjoyed just about every second of it." - Tal Blevins from IGN </TEXT>

If you just want to experience something short that's also one one the best modules in NWN, I recommend checking out [the Hex Coda module](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/hex-coda-01-canceled-premium-module) by Stefan Gagne. Installation is simple, simply copy things into the right folder (music, movies, etc.) inside your base NWN folder.

"...modern civilization is one of prosperity and safety, with all magic legally controlled by a monolithic business called the Cathedral Corporation. As part of the underground magic movement known as the Hex Coders, every day is a race to develop new arcane technologies and evade persecution by the Cathedral. That alone would be trouble enough, but add the sins of an ancient civilization rising in the present day and you've got more than your fair share of problems. Can you lead the team through this interlocking puzzle across time and space, and avoid getting twenty to life for unauthorized use of magic..?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There are so many moving pieces, and it feels organic. I/O really put in a lot of love and effort into this game, and it still gets a lot of negativity because of its episodic structure. But those same people fail to realize just how much depth every level has.

Hitman has some of the best crafted levels I've ever seen. Each level is like a diorama, that really captures the feel of a place. There are lots little details, like conversations between characters, or props, that make each level feel alive.

I find this approach so much better than the open worlds that Ubisoft has been developing for AC and Watch Dogs. In open world games, there's a huge map, but each part gets comparatively little attention. There's a lot of repetition and it becomes kind of a grind after a while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AC is really conflicted between being a stealth game or an action game. Some assassinations, like the one in Notre Dame in AC Unity, have "hitman-like" assassination options. You can disguise yourself as a priest and kill the target while he's in a confessional. There's also a way to unlock the door on the roof to sneak in through there. But most of the time, missions end in a big fight with the guards. Ubi didn't have the courage to make  a real stealth assassination game by making fighting almost impossible.

Same thing with Watch Dogs. It should be a game about using hacking and stealth, but you can just run in guns blazing. They really should have removed guns from that game, IMO. Aidan is supposed to be a "good guy" but at the same time he's a mass murdering psycho. By contrast, 47 only kills his target. 

The fact that 47 can't go in guns blazing is a great design choice. Hitman doesn't compromise between stealth and action. It's 100% about stealth. AC Unity has both options and as a result, neither of them are really great. The melee fights are not really fun and the stealth is not really well thought out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll try:

- Either go for a focused narrative with no choices (Last of Us), or go back to creating a true RPG (fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas).

- Write design documents. Emil Pagliarulo said in his talk that Beth didn't have any design docs. Seems sloppy and might explain why there's no depth to any of the factions. Why does this faction do this? What are its goals?

In fact, the whole faction design is weak. They didn't spend much time thinking about the different philosophies of the factions and how they approach the world differently.

FO1 and FO2 tried to create a "real" world, with towns, stores and NPCs. There are a few in FO4, but they're quite small. 

Also, there are very few quests that don't involve combat. This is a key difference. A large part of the gameplay in FO1 and FO2 was about talking to people, not fighting. Beth has always thought of dialogue as nothing more than an interruption in the fighting and a kind of wrapping around it to give you a reason to fight.

- Go back to a sane dialogue system. The dialogue auto advances with each answer. You tell 2 stupid jokes in a row and then the dialogue is over. It's weird. It's like the dialogue is just a very thin wrapping around a fetch quest.

There needs to be proper exploratory questions. Like who are you? What do you do here? What are your goals?

- Allow interesting and complex moral choices.

- Cut down on faceless raiders. In FO1 and FO2, outside of some random encounters, all of the "raiders" you met would initiate dialogue. They belonged to a faction or a gang that had its own objectives. Often, you could agree to help them instead of killing them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel bad for the developers:

" But the journey to ship Sleeping Dogs had a profound effect on the people who made it.

"Several of our best programmers decided to move on and there was some creative turnover, as well," said the same source. "It took several years of hell to ship Sleeping Dogs and many members of the team weren't willing to go through it all again. I was one of the few that stuck around, but even in my case, it took a large toll on my personal life and mental health. Studio culture is a fragile thing and even the loss of a few key people can change the entire dynamic of the workplace.""

They made an amazing game, but I wish they would have had the proper resources to make it without sacrificing their personal lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sad that the game was cancelled, but this sounds like a terrible idea:

" Playing as inspector Jane Teng, you would "manage the police force and try to control territories" from your mobile device. If you owned Sleeping Dogs 2, your choices in the mobile game influenced what's happening in the city, the gangs in control, etc. If you summoned a police patrol on a mobile device, you'd see that in-game as a helicopter flying by. If you didn't own Sleeping Dogs 2, the hope was to craft an enjoyable free-to-play game that pointed you towards the console game."

This part is more interesting, but I'm doubtful that it would have added much to the game:

"It was more than that, though. United Front Games envisioned a sprawling metagame it dubbed "massively single player," where actions you took in your gamebusting a crime, taking a bribewould adjust city dynamics in other players' games. The specifics hadn't been worked out yetthis was all theoreticalbut players could focus their efforts on cleaning up specific parts of town as a community and turn crime-ridden places into livable neighborhoods.

This would be achieved by "using the cloud saves of all players to determine the global neighborhood crime levels across all games, and then mapping that crime to the difficulty level in policing those neighborhoods in the individual's games."" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I replied to the right comment. You criticized /u/Exlithra for not explaining why he thought the gameplay footage didn't look exciting. So I proposed an explanation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me take a stab at it:

1) no music. Music makes game footage more exciting.

2) Environments are boring. Gold Horizon looked ten times better.

3) Space combat is underwhelming. Players in space are sitting ducks. They should have nitrogen jetpacks propelling them around or something. The windows look bad. They're way too thin for space station windows. It feels wrong.

4) Not epic enough. The objectives are fine for an alpha. But it's not battlefield, or overwatch, or call of duty, or Planetside 2. Now obviously, they can't directly compete with those games either.

5) No special flavor. They need something or some things that make their FPS different from what's already out there. Personally, I'd love to see a revival of Enemy Territory/Quake Wars style gameplay. But that's just me. </TEXT>
