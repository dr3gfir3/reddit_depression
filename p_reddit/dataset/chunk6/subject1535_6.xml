	<TEXT> The Eyes of the Dragon by Stephen King. It's completely unlike anything else he's written. But it's still my favourite of all his works.

I'm also a fan of Firestarter, The Stand, and The Dead Zone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And I don't quite follow the sequence of events at the end that allows Polly to free Tom. I know she's uses 'Tam Lin' to figure a way to get Tom out of his deal, but I don't exactly understand everything she does.

Also, is it just me or does the ending feel kind of abrupt, like it needed one more scene or something? </TEXT>
