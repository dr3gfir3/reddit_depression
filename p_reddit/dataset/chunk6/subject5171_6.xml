	<TEXT> This is why the Constitution is crap.  It's near impossible to change and is simply obsolete in modern times.  During the peak of our nation building days, we drafted much better constitutions for the governments we installed, stuff completely counter to our own and stuff we could never get into it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Three things:  

He's the cause of some of this shit.  He says things, and people react.  

He's unwittingly leaking classified info.  He gets reports about classified info, makes a public comment based on it, and later the stuff is revealed or the consequences of the intelligence findings come to be.

The Russians are feeding him information and/or causing stuff to happen in support of him.  It would be like if Putin said, "Don't worry about that Schiff guy.  He won't be around much longer."  And Trump tweets, "Sad to hear about Schiff.  Prayers to his family."  And three days later he dies in a car crash.
