	<TEXT> Yeah there are a lot of side benefits to uber, besides the cost, and convenience. For women, especially in these countries outside the USA, it is much safer to take a uber. There is a record of you interacting with this specific person, vs hailing some random guy on the street.

Even for myself who is a big burly guy, I feel it is much safer for me as well. I have had some crazy taxi rides with driver who were some combination of piss drunk, high, insane, over the borderline into scary religious. You never know who you will, get and you have no recourse. 

There was a Expos in the paper out here, where they requested to see the complaints filed by passengers against taxi drivers. The reporter described them rooting through a unorganized filing cabinet, and fishing out stacks of unaddressed claims, some going as far as assaults, fare theft, unwanted sexual talk with women etc.

The Taxi commission literally just filed everything under fuck you in this filing cabinet. The guy representing them also dug his grave, by insinuating that they have no way to know what cab is driven by whom, and even then they don't really have a enforcement apparatus . </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  d kills his way into winning then what, people will still have needs, people will still hold a grudge, things won't magically solve themselves

The problem with Syria is that they are in a quagmire. You have a period of time to execute a coup. Tunisia, Egypt, Libya are in much better shape, because things happened over the span of months not years. After a certain period then usually the dictator will eventually bring the insurgents to heel.


This is exactly what would have happened, if we just let it play out. It would have been a few months of fighting, but Assad would have swept back into control, and then when it was all said and done we could help broker, a peace deal, and perhaps some concessions for the disenfranchised.


Instead our lust to stick our nose into things proves unresistible, yet again gets a bunch of people killed. The US, and UN are aghast, as the phone videos come out showing pretty standard ravages of war in sharper detail, then before.  

Decisive leadership would be to pick a side, and go in 100%, or impose brutal sanctions to force Assad to the table. Instead we do a bunch of wishy washy, mixed messaging, threaten to do no fly zones, start handing out a bunch of guns to random guys. Generally just dipping our toe into the conflict. All the while the rebels (who lost years ago), are getting slaughtered wholesale in slow motion.

I was a huge Obama fan, but on this issue I think he totally screwed up. On the other hand I hated 99% of Trumps platform, but his pledge to stop being the world police actually had me on board.

Now I hate 100% of his platform.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i understand what you are getting at but for many reasons, it is a false equivalence.

A lot of things have changed since then. Also the French Revolution started from within, and was not a proxy war for a bunch of competing foreign interests. While I am sure their were many factions competing for power after all was said, and done, France didn't have anywhere near as much tribal infighting as the ME. 

There will never be a moment where these people sit down, at a table, and break bread diplomatically. We will ultimately find another dictator to prop up, we will turn a blind eye to him trampling human rights, and he will sit every party at a table with a gun to their head.

And this will all have been a exercise in futility.

I just think of the last election where I liked both candidates back in 2008. I was a fan of Obama, and McCain. I felt both would have done a good job, and in a lot of ways I am actually fiscally conservative, so it could have gone either way. 

However I would never vote for McCain because he would have undermined women's reproductive rights, and I am pro choice. If the rolls were ever reversed on just a few social issues I would have considered voting for a (neo)conservative candidate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am far from a bigot, but I am a realist. 

Look at pictures of Baghdad, Tripoli, Alleppo before, and after American interventionist democracy came to town. 

Before: there were clean streets, modern amenities, international airports, global chain stores, a large middle class of people going to work. 

After: Rubble strewn streets. All signs of normalcy hacked down, and burned for warmth in the harsh winter. Utilities not working, impossible to educate the children, government graft that was already bad, gets to the point where nothing gets done without a bribe. No services, or sense of security. 

No way to sugar coat it. The Dictators were bad men. If the stories are true, they were capable of murdering a bunch of innocent people just to prove a point. The thing is that so are we, our policy of running to people's aid indiscriminately shooting rockets, and machine guns in every direction leads to so much collateral damage that in the end we are worse. 

I'm sure if you ask one of the millions of widows, parents of dead children, or children of dead parents if they are better off now that democracy has come to town, they will say "no". 


If Sadam were still in power. 4000 plus American troops would still be alive. Over 1,000,000 iraqui people would still be alive, ISIS in its current form would have never existed, the trash in Bagdad would have gotten picked up every tuesday, and alternate side of the street parking would be in effect Thursday to let the street sweeper through. America would have been a lot better prepared for the 2008 crisis, all that money would have been in our coffers, instead of spilled in the sand hamfistedly trying to change a culture by destroying it. 

The truth is that it is not our business to spread democracy. It is in our best interest to be a shining example of it. With the internet prevalent now, people will put pressure on their government, and slowly make changes, until some semblance of a modern progressive lifestyle emerges. 

The thing is the people need to work inside the system, and we need a all powerful leader in place to deal with the unique political landscape of the Middle east. I am all for applying political pressure to expedite change. In a alternate version of history peace and prosperity would have eventually come to the middle east, as the internet spread and ideas formed. That is not what happened though. 

America is totally to blame for all this chaos. It started with toppling sadam, then standing back and allowing the Arab spring to happen. Our democracy never gave these poor people a chance.

	<TEXT> Even in light of the chemical attack, backing Assad is the only path to stability. It is a bitter pill to swallow, but as the saying goes, better the devil you know. 

We have numerous examples of what happens when we allow a dictator to topple. All the empirical evidence from Libya, and Tunesia suggests that chaos will fill the vacuum. 

The hard truth is that our foreign policy during the entire Arab spring, was all wrong. It is nice to have the ideal that toppling a cruel dictator in the middle east, will suddenly convert every resident there into progressive, forward thinking, productive members of the free world. 

The sad truth is that in its current form the Arab world cannot function without a strongman government. The only successful instance of this is Turkey, and every day that goes by, Erduogan become something closer to a dictator. 

The only road to peace is to back Assad, and finish what the Russians started, then slowly through, carrot, and sticks start to rebuild peacful territories. Then as more people willingly bend to Assad, have the international community come in, and provide aid, help rebuild, and restore some semblance of normalcy. 

I think if given the option of endless war or a path back to a life, the people of Syria would come back together under Assad.  </TEXT>

Instead you show up with this dainty twinkle toes hatch, and a utility trailer. You are such a smug euro cunt, that even the slightest hint of masculinity is unsightly to you. You need to pluck your eyebrows, and change into 3 different outfits before you are fashionable enough to do yard work.  </TEXT>

I don't really see this as a Democrats position at all. The more I think about it they were probably just trying to get ahead of the story, and wanted to avoid being called weak, but in doing so they gave him his first victory under terrible precident. 

With trump you need to think of everything like you are dealing with a child. You never want to reinforce any bad behavior. To give bipartisan support to a impulsive bombing raid, he will surely remember this the next time he is in a corner, and perhaps it will have higher stakes then the international pariah Assad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes but the US phoning Russia well ahead of time, and then bombing one base, is not the type of aggression that would actually be crossing a line. In the scheme of things things this is a bump in the road. Obama crashed their economy, and it is still crashed to this day. 

If you really take the 10,000 foot view Assad, Putin, and Trump all win in this scenario. Sure a airstrip, and I would assume some expensive planes blew up. 
However Assad gets to look even more ruthless to his foes, Trump gets to look like he did something, and Putin gets to feign outrage thus taking some air out of the Russia scandal. 

Also how Trump treats Syria, and the Russians going forward are not necessarily a indication of what happened last year. If things get really bad with the investigation, expect him to do some rash things to prove he is anti russia. 

There is a line a mile long of people who made deals with trump, who ended up out in the cold, holding the bag. I have no doubts that Trump will eventually renig on whatever quid pro quo, he had established with Moskow.

	<TEXT> Yup. This article spells out my thoughts of these developments word for word. It gives trump cover that he is going against Putin, but Puton doesn't actually care about Syria. It is a proxy war on 15 different levels, the least of which is caring what happens to Assad. 

If he were to play his cards right he could maneuver this into a huge (short lived) political win. He has a cordial dinner with the PM of China, and then reigns hell fire on a country, while he is sleeping at Trumps house. This bolsters Trump as a tough guy with China, N Korea, and is a smoke screen on Russia. 

Luckily Trump is a blithering idiot, and will be right back to stepping on his own nuts within moments, and the news cycle will still be all Russia, and his non stop gaffes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's actually the mixed messaging that is the most dangerous part of Trumps foreign policy. A man who has no convictions, and who's elegances change depending on who is the room, is the last person who should be making these decisions. 

We need a resolute leader. W was wrong to invade iraq, but he never had his secretary of state, and UN envoy out there insinuating we would stand down. When US troops lives are on the line, then he needs to pick a option and stick to it. 

I would say he should just defer to Mattis, but even though he seems more sane then all of the other jabronis, he is quite hawkish, and may decide to get us in yet another quagmire.  </TEXT>
