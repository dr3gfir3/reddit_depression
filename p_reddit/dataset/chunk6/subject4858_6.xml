	<TEXT> Lets hope that the first singularity AI is developed for academic research, weather pattern studies instead of in the military, designed for killing humans. 

In human children and monkey studies about development nature has its place but even people with the brain "shape" of a psychopath can end up wildly different depending on nurture and the environment it is brought up in.

	<TEXT> She is literally talking utter nonsense, she may as well be in a cult talking about the mothership. Any faculty that gives her a degree should be disbanded. They are massively banking on their "blackness" and victim status to stop anyone telling them they are stupid and to gtf out, almost feel the twitter rage if anyone said anything sensible. People like this should be challenged by sending Nigerian engineering/tech students to the panel to cut through their bullshit call them ignorant and demeaning to Africans that live in the real world away from unprovable/untestable liberal arts theories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All Scotch whisky has to be aged 3 years to be called scotch. That is 3 years as judged by the tax office (legal requirement) if they manage the dates right it can do just over 2 years in a bonded warehouse and it now qualifies as "Scotch". The named single malt distilleries used to send upwards of 70% of their produce to the big name conglomerate blends like famous grouse, teachers etc where it would be mixed with other 3 year olds and grain whisky to make the standard blends which are the bulk of the scotch whisky market. This gave them the revenue stream to support the development of their "real" product the 10 plus aged whiskies that are their own brand. 

But now virtually all the Scotch whisky malt makers are owned by huge transnational companies that finance the creation of brands, huge marketing budgets, product placement into the Asian markets and the aging of stock. There is also the marketing creation of "special" non aged stock branding so the distillery with a big name single malt will call it something like dark storm sherry cask and charge premium price for it but omit the fact it has not been aged at all so the mark up is crazy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The bike would make a great tourer. Think of all the bikepacking and pannier touring now done on MTBs, fast touring done on cross bikes/road bikes, your hybrid would be great but you probably do want a triple if you are climbing hills fully loaded. You are right about it being a cost/time/effort judgement. If you still have to buy panniers/rack etc then it will probably cost you a minimum of 300 to convert. It might be easier to buy a new bike already with triple gears and sell the one you have. One thing to be wary of is buying secondhand unless you get a really good look at it or know/trust the seller. So many secondhand "bargins" need wheels trued/serviced/new bottom bracket/new cassette/chain etc and that can quite quickly eat away any savings over a new bike. 

Convert yours or not? Up to you and DIY would mean you could fix it all yourself on your next round the world trip. It would work out cheaper but probably only by a few hundred. It would take time and lots of youtube videos or visits to local bike co op to get help plus tools. If you do decide to do it here are some links about parts to give you an idea of costs/options etc

Handle bars - Drop bars are good but so are butterfly bars and flatbars with good bar ends that give multiple hand positions. Flatbar gears shifters/brakes go straight onto butterfly bars.

Saddle - I tour in road bike shorts on a mtb saddle very comfy and cheaper than brooks.

Gears/Transmission/Make it a triple :

You can buy a complete Shimano Deore triple groupset for about 160ish, if you can fit it yourself that would be cheaper than buying triple conversion pieces for your sora flatbar groupset (chainset 75?, front derailleur 20?, shifter 80). The bike shop is a good price inc labour and non sora parts will be just as good for touring.

https://www.cyclestore.co.uk/productDetails.asp?productID=59142

If you are able to go lightweight then you would be fine with a double chainset so just put bar ends on, rack and panniers and off you go!

	<TEXT> Look at IMF support for various EU projects like the Euro and their recent admission that they got it totally wrong and it was completely political bias and wishful thinking. 

During the Brexit vote of UK in or out of the EU one politician kept getting challenged on economic predictions of failure if UK left the EU. He eventually just said it was about more than economics and that the IMF etc had failed several times on predicting global trends  and that knowing this people had had enough of experts. He was mocked but lo and behold a few months later an internal IMF report admitted that much of its European forecasting was bullshit and aimed to prop up the political idea of an EU federal state.  </TEXT>

But the generals still gave them all the stuff and kept writing reports saying training and building the army is all going well, we can give them everything and the bases and now we can pull out. Mission accomplished! </TEXT>

It might help you to drink on a schedule and the heat might limit hunger but you need the kcal and salts. Plus hat or some sort of head covering.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They have. The current "refugee" crisis has spiked because Libya recently opened up as a transit route for smugglers and despite there being so many economic migrants from Africa, Syria fighting really has displaced millions in the region. But Calais has had the "jungle" for many years and for 15 years or so Afghans etc have been walking seeking new lives across europe. 1999 the sangatte camp opened in Calais. But riots and breaking into trucks gets old news fast so it disapears from public eye and news radar for a few years. The migrants are still there. </TEXT>
