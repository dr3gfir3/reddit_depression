	<TEXT>  The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake took place at a depth of 10 kilometers.

The USGS states a depth of [0km](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us10004bnm#scientific_summary). 10km is far, far too deep for this level of activity. For some perspective the deepest hole ever drilled is the [Kola Superdeep Borehole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole) which reached an astonishing 12.2km depth but encountered numerous problems along the way and was a mere 9" in diameter. The worlds deepest mine sits at around 4km depth, the [Mponeng Gold Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mponeng_Gold_Mine), and due to the extreme environment is a feat of engineering. The geothermal gradient is about 25C per km of depth on a global average, so at 4km depth you're looking at 100C... 10km... you do the math. Given the aforementioned it becomes clear to see how it's simply not technologically possible to have such a device detonated at the depth you stated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During deglaciation of North America, shortly after the last glacial maximum, countless glacial outburst floods occurred and are recorded in numerous locations including "[the Channeled Scablands](http://www.museumofthecity.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/LkMissoulaMap.jpg)." Upper flow rates for some events have been estimated at [386 million cubic feet per second](http://www.glaciallakemissoula.org/story.html). 

Megaripples on West Bar on the Columbia River, south of Wenatchee, Washington, were generated by surging floodwaters (glacial outburst flood) from the mouth of Moses Coulee during the Pleistocene. These enormous bedforms sit on a terrace more than ~46m (150 ft) above the present day river, and are ~90 to 110m (300 to 350 ft) long and about 8 to 12m (25 to 40 ft) high. The floodwaters are estimated to have been between 213 to 270m (700 to 900 ft) deep at this location during their deposition. - [image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/luxlaboratories/15394542861/in/album-72157648181402601/lightbox/) </TEXT>

Interestingly, this EQ occurred off the east coast of southern Vancouver Island. And while that's nothing particularly special about it, it can be noted that [since 1969](http://pnsn.org/earthquakes/historic?evid=61114971) there have only been a total of 5 EQs that fall between Mw4.0 and Mw5.0 including this event all of which occur at roughly a similar depth. Thus, while EQs along the Cascadia subduction zone are quite common, even at these moment magnitudes, hypocenters off the east coast of southern Vancouver Island aren't nearly as common. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At one point the Earth actually did lose its atmosphere. To explain let's take a look at Earth's atmospheric composition through time in some detail. Earth's primary atmosphere should have inherited its composition directly from the solar nebula, and the gaseous elements neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon should be present in approximate solar abundances, allowing for the addition of radiogenic isotopes; however, that is not the case. It has been repeatedly noted over the past half-century that all the noble gases are grossly depleted in the Earths atmosphere compared with solar and cosmic abundances. They are depleted, in fact, by several orders of magnitude. This means either that Earth accumulated without an atmosphere of nebular proportions or that any initial atmosphere escaped its gravity field in some subsequent episode of heating that accelerated even the heavy noble gases to escape velocities. The secondary atmosphere was generated by volcanic degassing and subsequent precipitation, whereby the oxygen was generated during [the great oxidation event](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7261/images/461179a-f1.2.jpg) much later on in Earth's geological history.  

**The Primitive Atmosphere**

Three possible sources have been considered for the Earths atmosphere: residual gases remaining after Earth accretion, extraterrestrial sources, and degassing of the Earth by volcanism. Of these, only degassing accommodates a variety of geochemical and isotopic constraints. One line of evidence supporting a degassing origin for the atmosphere is the large amount of ^40 Ar in the atmosphere (99.6%) compared with the amount in the Sun or a group of primitive meteorites known as carbonaceous chondrites (both of which contain 0.1% ^40 Ar). ^40 Ar is produced by the radioactive decay of ^40 K in the solid Earth and escapes into the atmosphere chiefly by volcanism. The relatively large amount of this isotope in the terrestrial atmosphere indicates that the Earth is extensively degassed of argon and, because of a similar behavior, of other rare gases. Although most investigators agree that the present atmosphere, except for oxygen, is chiefly the product of degassing, whether a primitive atmosphere existed and was lost before extensive degassing began is a subject of controversy. One line of evidence supporting the existence of an early atmosphere is that volatile elements should collect around planets during their late stages of accretion. This follows from the low temperatures at which volatile elements condense from the solar nebula. A significant depletion in rare gases in the Earth compared with carbonaceous chondrites and the Sun indicates that if a primitive atmosphere collected during accretion, it must have been lost. The reason for this is that gases with low atomic weights (CO2, CH4, NH3, H2, etc.) that probably composed this early atmosphere should be lost even more readily than rare gases with high atomic weights (Ar, Ne, Kr, and Xe) and greater gravitational attraction. Just how such a primitive atmosphere may have been lost is not clear. One possibility is by a T-Tauri solar wind. If the Sun evolved through a T-Tauri stage during or soon after (100 My) planetary accretion, this wind of high-energy particles could readily blow volatile elements out of the inner solar system. Another way an early atmosphere could have been lost is by impact with a Mars-size body during the late stages of planetary accretion, a model also popular for the origin of the Moon. Calculations indicate, however, that less than 30% of a primordial atmosphere could be lost during the collision of the two planets. Two models have been proposed for the composition of a primitive atmosphere. The Oparin-Urey model suggests that the atmosphere was reduced and composed dominantly of CH4 with smaller amounts of NH3, H2, He, and water; the Abelson model is based on an early atmosphere composed of CO2, CO,water, and N2. Neither atmosphere allows significant amounts of free oxygen, and experimental studies indicate that reactions may occur in either atmosphere that could produce the first life. By analogy with the composition of the Sun and the compositions of the atmospheres of the outer planets and of volatile-rich meteorites, an early terrestrial atmosphere may have been rich in such gases as CH4, NH3, and H2 and would have been a reducing atmosphere. One of the major problems with an atmosphere in which NH3 is important is that this species is destroyed directly or indirectly by photolysis in as little as 10 years. In addition, NH3 is highly soluble in water and should be removed rapidly from the atmosphere by rain and solution at the ocean surface. Although CH4 is more stable against photolysis, OH, which forms as an intermediary in the methane oxidation chain, is destroyed by photolysis at the Earths surface in less than 50 years. H2 rapidly escapes from the top of the atmosphere; therefore, it also is an unlikely major constituent in an early atmosphere. Models suggest that the earliest atmosphere may have been composed dominantly of CO2 and CH4, both important greenhouse gases.

**The Secondary Atmosphere**

*Excess Volatile*

The Earths present atmosphere appears to have formed largely by degassing of the mantle and crust and is commonly referred to as a secondary atmosphere. Degassing is the liberation of gases from within a planet, and it may occur directly during volcanism or indirectly by the weathering of igneous rocks on a planetary surface. For the Earth, volcanism appears to be most important both in terms of current degassing rates and calculated past rates. The volatiles in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and sediments that cannot be explained by weathering of the crust are known as excess volatiles. These include most of the water, CO2, and N2 in these near-surface reservoirs. The similarity in the distribution of excess volatiles in volcanic gases to those in near-surface reservoirs strongly supports a volcanogenic origin for these gases and thus supports a degassing origin for the atmosphere.

Table depicting similarities between volcanic gases and reservoirs:

|Species |	Volcanic gases (%) |	*Near Surface Reservoirs |
|:------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|H2O |	83 |	87 |
|CO2 	|12 |	12 |
|Cl, N2, S |	5 |	1 |

*This includes, atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and sediments

Please feel free to do your own further research and you will see that quite a few of these "refutations" you point out have in fact been addressed by the original authors in the year since you've made your "frustration" known on this topic.

Again, it would be nice if these discussions didn't always seem to end in a pissing match, but alas, I suppose that's to be expected here. - /u/MrSloppyPants

As a part of my degree I would like to say that I have studied numerous studies and am fully capable of assessing scientific papers on the subject in question. The fact is that a number of the issues have *not* been refuted by any convincing means by the Firestone et al consortium, or have been entirely ignored all together. 

What pissing match? It's not a pissing match, or some sort of conspiracy against their hypothesis, it's science. So far they simply haven't been able to aggregate evidence that is either credible, refrain from questionable methodology, or in some cases even generate reproducible data! What is expected here is unbiased views... something you clearly lack. The evidence *against* Firestone et al from the scientific community is tremendous and for some reason you simply won't accept that. What would be nice is if supporters of this hypothesis weren't blinded by their own self motivations, and fantasies.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a number of uncertainties with regard to plate tectonics, and while we have a reasonable knowledge base within the constraints of Earth like plate tectonics there are a lot of assumptions that may or may not be justifiable the further one migrates away from an Earth like mass. It is typically argued that, at least on planets with masses equal to that of Earth, [water is a requirement](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm) for the process of plate tectonics to be initiated and sustained. While some authors argue in favour of this:

At least in the simplest case, factors other than planet size, such as the presence of surface water, are likely most important for determining the presence or absence of plate tectonics. - Plate tectonics on super-Earths: Equally or more likely than on Earth ([pdf](http://jupiter.ethz.ch/~pjt/papers/vanHeck2011PEPI_SuperEarths.pdf))

Others do not when it comes to super-Earths:

Moreover, uncertainties in achieving plate tectonics in the [1 Earth mass] regime disappear as mass increases: super-Earths, even if dry, will exhibit plate tectonic behavior. - Inevitability of Plate Tectonics on Super-Earths ([pdf](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~sasselov/exopl/tectonics.pdf))

In the abstract you refer to the authors suggest that higher pressures increase viscosity to such a degree that mantle convection would be extremely sluggish. They further argue that the increased temperatures and pressures would also be unfavourable for ascending plumes. When something is bouyant it rises, when it's negatively bouyant it sinks and when it's neutral it stagnates. Here the authors suggest that "ascending plumes lose their buoyancy on their way and hardly reach the surface boundary." All of this leads to a thicker crust with unfavourable conditions for Earth like plate tectonics on super-Earths. As the authors note in an article:

Earths tectonic plates are driven by a conveyor belt of sinking and rising rock. Previous studies had predicted that the extra heat inside super-Earths would easily power similar movement.

Those studies, however, adapted previously created simulations of Earths internal movements. The studies did not consider the changes that come with a bigger planet, Miyagoshi says. Larger planets put more pressure on their interiors. That boosts temperatures at lower depths. And it changes how rocks and magma  liquid rock  move through the planet.

Miyagoshi and his colleagues simulated a planet with 10 times Earths mass. Blobs of cold rock descended into the simulated interior. Then, rising pressures heated the rock and stalled its fall. Similarly, rising plumes of magma cooled and slowed as they climbed toward the surface. This lethargic movement created a stagnant shell around the planet that was roughly 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) thick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We still need to research what exactly is sustaining our own magnetic field though and what our Earth's core is even composed of.

We actually have some fairly good constraints on those two areas of research with any new discoveries likely to result in minor component adjustments or slight refinements to the overall theories. For example our magnetic field is a self-sustaining geodynamo explained (in a previous comment of mine) as follows:

___

It's a theory, but a good theory based on some simple physics. I'll try to re-hash some old notes to help explain it:

######Earth's Magnetic Field:

Earth's magnetic field ([MF](http://portugalmundial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dynamos_magfield.jpg)) can be approximated (90%) by a dipole (bar magnet) with the MF oriented ~11 from the rotational poles. However, the MF is not due to permanent magnetism since the Earth's interior is far too hot (600C) to retain magnetization, therefore, it must be induced by electric current flow.

######Source of MF:

The MF is believed to be generated by thermally-driven convection currents in the fluid outer-core (electrically conductive molten iron) producing [a self-exciting dynamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory), with axial symmetry imposed by Earth's rotation. The study of which is called [Magnetohydrodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Geophysics) (combining electricity, magnetism, fluid dynamics, and heat flow). Mechanical models of self-exciting magnetic dynamos can be built as an analogy of Earth's MF.

######Faraday Disc:

(1) Consider a conducting disc rotating in an external MF. Negative charges accumulate at the rim, and positive charges accumulate at the axis due to the [Lorenz Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force). ([see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/7aRrhO6.png))

(2) The disc is connected to the axis with a conductive wire that allows current to flow (direction is that of positive charges by convention). The current flow in the loop induces a MF given by the right-hand-rule (RHR - point your thumb of your right hand along the current flow, when you curl your fingers it will be in the direction of induced MF). The current flow induced by the external MF induces a secondary MF in the same direction as the external MF, reinforcing the MF, inducing more current (positive feedback - [see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/K3oElCE.jpg)). A small transient MF can be amplified and lead to a self-sustaining MF, with the energy coming from rotation.

The controversy comes in the form of the transient MF, as the theory doesn't explain that aspect, it just notes that one is required. Essentially you have the following explanation:

For magnetic field generation to occur several conditions must be met: 1. there must be a conducting fluid; 2. there must be enough energy to cause the fluid to move with sufficient speed and with the appropriate flow pattern; 3. there must be a seed magnetic field (transient MF) There is sufficient energy in the outer core to drive convection, and coupled with the Earths rotation, produce the appropriate flow pattern. The existing field of the Sun acts as the seed field. As a stream of molten iron passes through the existing magnetic field of the Sun, an electric current is generated, and the newly created electric field will in turn create a magnetic field.

At 410km depth the phase change from [Olivine to -Spinel](https://d29qn7q9z0j1p6.cloudfront.net/content/roypta/363/1837/2811/F1.large.jpg) actually promotes subduction through the mechanism of "slab pull", the strongest of the three major contributing forces (ridge push, and slab suction being the others), which can be examined by the slope of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. It is the 660km discontinuity (phase transition from Spinels to Perovskite) that typically acts as [a barrier to down going slabs](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7317/fig_tab/nature09401_F1.html). 

Furthermore, it has been suggested that plate tectonics on super-Earths may be unlikely^[1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JE004793/abstract) though there is room for debate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Though the vast majority of reported incidences are due to waste water injection reactivating faults, there are recorded events attributed to the hydraulic fracturing itself and not waste water injection - though they are less common. The problem is likely due to poor survey methods. There are a large number of companies that simply do not complete adequate geophysical surveys in order to locate documented and undocumented faults systems. The process needs tighter regulations to reduce the chances of activating these faults.

EDIT: For those looking for quality information on the issue the USGS does [monthly public lectures](http://online.wr.usgs.gov/calendar/archives.html).

	<TEXT> I'm not familiar with the geology of the region, but I would say that it seems reasonable that there may exist more "bluestone," however, it may be extremely difficult to locate. Bluetsone is an unbelievably ambiguous name, meaning anything from spotted dolerite, unspotted dolerite, to rhyolite, [etc](http://brian-mountainman.blogspot.ca/2010/11/more-than-30-different-bluestone.html). Approx. [55%](http://www.livescience.com/43578-source-stonehenge-rocks-pinpointed.html) of the dolerite stones come from [Carn Goedog](http://i.livescience.com/images/i/000/062/877/original/stonehenge-rocks.jpg?1393017719), a relatively small outcrop. The glacial history is important, advances and retreats, as they all describe times of deposition and erosion. It seems entirely reasonable that should such small outcrops be "[plucked](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53109b11e4b05040160f0a8f/t/55fbcf48e4b04c74c5055c48/1442565963803/)," and subsequently transported that their deposition would include burial under thick(?) till blankets. So a small initial contribution from a small outcrop - transported hundreds of kilometers down ice, deposited synchronously with other till deposits and subsequently blanketed by later glacial drift (ie. glacial outwash, etc.) - would certainly be difficult to located the entire debris train from point to source. [Ice flow indicators](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FraUxsnCivU/TU1bFaFbF5I/AAAAAAAAAtk/kAF_51bDgJ4/s1600/GBG+map.jpg) certainly add weight to the claim though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...all natural gas is of biological origin...

There are two main types of natural gas: thermogenic and biogenic natural gas. Thermogenic natural gas is the result of chemical reactions that occur without the presence of microorganisms (pressure and temperature controlled), where as biogenic natural gas occurs as a result of the growth of microorganisms (methanogens) near the surface of the earth. Thermogenic and biogenic natural gas will therefore have [different isotopic ratios](http://www.spe.org/jpt/img/posts/p9692/m1_768.jpg).

For example, Cere's has Ammonia ice... the presence of which suggests that it may have migrated to its current position in the asteroid belt as it's too warm for ammonia ice to exist on Ceres today, it would have evaporated. 

Carbonaceous chondrites *D/H ratios* don't tell us about the abundance of water present, but rather just the '[finger print](http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/4e/ESA_Rosetta_ROSINA_DH_ratio.jpg).'

	<TEXT> So initially it can rise through the mantle (deep Earth) because it is less dense than the surrounding mantle, similar to how a [lava lamp works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL3Ez9bxMTo). But when it reaches the upper mantle / lower crust, it's like the wax in the lava lamp reaching the top... there's no where to go. But as it 'sits' there it warms up the surrounding rock. When things warm up they tend to expand which can also create cracks, like the cracks that can form in a pie crust as it cooks in the oven. But, once a crack is formed, the magma under high pressure now has a pathway to move up again created by the drop in pressure - similar to removing the cap on a shaken bottle of pop - the drop in surrounding pressure allows the high pressure stuff to rise up.

	<TEXT>  Remember that in order for the lava to get to the surface in the first place it had to literally move mountains.

Mmm, not quite. Hawaii's volcanism (and others) is derived from a mantle plume originating [from the core mantle boundary](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v525/n7567/fig_tab/nature14876_F3.html) (CMB). It rises up through the mantle due to contrasting densities (it's positively buoyant). Once it reaches the crust it will rise through a process known as [stoping](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/journalimages/GEOCAN/2006/Vol_33/No_04/geocan33_4ser01_fig7.jpg). Thermal expansion, due to the intruding magma, causes the surrounding country rock to deform. Increases in pressure can produce [fractures](http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/images/stoping.gif), creating a drop in pressure in which the magma will now inject itself forming '[dykes](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140211/ncomms4272/images/ncomms4272-f3.jpg)' until it breaches the surface.

	<TEXT> We do. These studies suggest that there exists a region below the 660 discontinuity in which there is a substantial increase in viscosity which lies at ~1000km depth.

Abstract

The viscosity structure of Earths deep mantle affects the thermal evolution of Earth, the ascent of mantle plumes, settling of subducted oceanic lithosphere, and the mixing of compositional heterogeneities in the mantle. Based on a reanalysis of the long-wavelength nonhydrostatic geoid, we infer viscous layering of the mantle using a method that allows us to avoid a priori assumptions about its variation with depth. We detect an increase in viscosity at 800- to 1200-kilometers depth, far greater than the depth of the mineral phase transformations that define the mantle transition zone. The viscosity increase is coincident in depth with regions where seismic tomography has imaged slab stagnation, plume deflection, and changes in large-scale structure and offers a simple explanation of these phenomena.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's the likelihood of people being warned about one of these if it would hit the Earth? 

Near certainty. Doing geophysical surveys (proton precession magnetometer survey for example) we need to calibrate a base station to Earth's magnetic field in the local area of the survey. That way we can subtract it from the geophysical ground survey which will then highlight the anomalies generated by the rocks / ore bodies. However, we need to check the weather first - [the space weather](http://www.spaceweather.com/) that is - as any large fluctuations will generate too much noise, rendering the survey essentially useless and potentially wasting the day (time and money, and every ones efforts). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, many huge slabs of ocean crust that have been dragged down, or subducted, into the mantle can still be seen in the deep Earth.

For anyone curious about how we see the slabs, it's through methods such as seismic tomography, correlating the speeds of seismic waves to different densities. Colder objects (such as rigid, older negatively bouyant oceanic lithosphere) tend to be more dense than hotter objects (such as weak, hot partially melted asthenosphere) and so seismic waves will travel more quickly through these regions. Resolution decreases with depth so the deeper you penetrate the more uncertain your results become. The following set of images highlight this method of analysis: ([A](http://epsc.wustl.edu/seismology/LABATTS/research_figs/cross.gif)) ([B](http://www.mantleplumes.org/images3/SeisProbFig3_550.jpg)). Image A clearly shows the discontinuity at [660km](http://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/images/geophysik/seismologie/bilder/wavevelocities1d.bmp) depth by the clustering of hypocentres as the plate buckles and flexes (the 660 transition zone acts as a boundary, unlike the one [located at 410](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_zone_%28Earth%29) which acts as a mechanism to pull the slab further down - one of the main components behind plate tectonics).  </TEXT>

Purely speculating, without extensive knowledge of the outcrop itself, I would hazard a guess the dikes provided the heat and along with [infiltration of sea water](http://www.geol.umd.edu/~piccoli/100/Image185.jpg) the rocks were heavily oxidized through the subsequent alteration reactions. These could later be more readily weathered than other regions of the outcrop due to compositional differences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a special place in the heart of geologists for Pliny the Younger, especially those with a focus in volcanology. The following is a description regarding a specific type of volcanic eruption:
___

**Plinian eruptions**:

Events such as the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens in Washington State, USA are typical of Plinian eruptions. These eruptions were named after Pliny the Younger who wrote an account of the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius which destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. In eruptions of this kind a jet of gas and magma clasts emerges from the vent at speeds of 100600 m s^1 and forms a convecting eruption plume in the atmosphere as the surrounding air is sucked into the jet. Clasts are carried upwards and progressively fall out from the eruption plume. Large clasts are carried upwards only a short distance and fall to the ground close to the vent, while smaller clasts are carried to greater heights and fall out further from the vent, forming part of an unconsolidated airfall deposit. The eruptions are sustained, and can last for hours or days. Eruptions exhibiting this style of activity are subdivided into [sub-Plinian, Plinian, and ultra-Plinian](https://imgur.com/Ropagag) based on their mass flux and plume heights (factors which are linked). Mass fluxes across the three subtypes range from 106 to 109 kg s^1, rates which are generally greatly in excess of those for recent basaltic eruptions. Mass fluxes during recent eruptions at Kilauea are  105 kg s^1 , whereas the highest mass flux during the (exceptional) Laki eruption was 107 kg s^1 . Generally, Plinian eruptions involve magmas which are relatively rich in silica and in dissolved gases, are very viscous, and erupt at lower temperatures than basalts. They are the products of various kinds of interaction of more basaltic melts with other rocks in the crust. The commonest magma types involved in Plinian eruptions are called dacites and rhyolites, but rare basaltic Plinian eruptions are known. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Certainly not an expert on it, I'm not a geophysicist, but I feel confident I understand the basics of the "controversy" if it can rightly be called that.  

It's a theory, but a good theory based on some simple physics. I'll try to re-hash some old notes to help explain it:

######Earth's Magnetic Field:

Earth's magnetic field ([MF](http://portugalmundial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dynamos_magfield.jpg)) can be approximated (90%) by a dipole (bar magnet) with the MF oriented ~11 from the rotational poles. However, the MF is not due to permanent magnetism since the Earth's interior is far too hot (600C) to retain magnetization, therefore, it must be induced by electric current flow.

######Source of MF:

The MF is believed to be generated by thermally-driven convection currents in the fluid outer-core (electrically conductive molten iron) producing [a self-exciting dynamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory), with axial symmetry imposed by Earth's rotation. The study of which is called [Magnetohydrodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Geophysics) (combining electricity, magnetism, fluid dynamics, and heat flow). Mechanical models of self-exciting magnetic dynamos can be built as an analogy of Earth's MF.

######Faraday Disc:

(1) Consider a conducting disc rotating in an external MF. Negative charges accumulate at the rim, and positive charges accumulate at the axis due to the [Lorenz Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force). ([see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/7aRrhO6.png))

(2) The disc is connected to the axis with a conductive wire that allows current to flow (direction is that of positive charges by convention). The current flow in the loop induces a MF given by the right-hand-rule (RHR - point your thumb of your right hand along the current flow, when you curl your fingers it will be in the direction of induced MF). The current flow induced by the external MF induces a secondary MF in the same direction as the external MF, reinforcing the MF, inducing more current (positive feedback - [see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/K3oElCE.jpg)). A small transient MF can be amplified and lead to a self-sustaining MF, with the energy coming from rotation.

If you're interested further, or simply looking for further clarity and have some time to kill do a search for 'Nova - Magnetic Storm.' It's nothing technical but it does explore the subject of reversals.

The controversy comes in the form of the transient MF, as the theory doesn't explain that aspect, it just notes that one is required. Essentially you have the following explanation:

For magnetic field generation to occur several conditions must be met: 1. there must be a conducting fluid; 2. there must be enough energy to cause the fluid to move with sufficient speed and with the appropriate flow pattern; 3. there must be a seed magnetic field (transient MF) There is sufficient energy in the outer core to drive convection, and coupled with the Earths rotation, produce the appropriate flow pattern. The existing field of the Sun acts as the seed field. As a stream of molten iron passes through the existing magnetic field of the Sun, an electric current is generated, and the newly created electric field will in turn create a magnetic field. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. I felt my comment was perhaps becoming a bit lengthy so I certainly left out a lot I would have liked to include. In regard to people getting turned off, I would also recommend not only trying it neat, sipping slowly, and letting it develop on your palate mixing with your own saliva, but of course opening it up with some water (not too much though - and preferably water from the distillery) - turning it altogether into an almost entirely new experience.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a great question. I'm relatively new to Scotch myself so I can't really suggest too many. Currently, being drawn to the distilleries of Islay, I'm trying to taste a "classic" from each one. Lagavulin 16 is an excellent choice in my books, and there's nothing wrong with picking up another bottle. If you're looking to take it up a notch though, I would recommend sitting in on a tasting event or looking for a [whisky house](http://www.shebeen.ca/whiskey-list.pdf) (pdf) where you can sample a good variety. That, or perhaps a pub with a decent whisky list as well.

Really though, I hesitate to recommend one in particular as they each have their own occasion. I absolutely enjoy filling my hip flask with Talisker 10 for an autumn hike or winter camping. The long finish warms you up nicely, while others are great for other occasions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's so much variety it really depends on your tastes. There are plenty of good whiskys out there from single malt (a single distillery) to blended (more than one whisky from multiple distilleries blended together). I won't speak for whisky/ey outside of Scotland (Scotch) though there are plenty of good options as already mentioned (such as [Balcones Texas Single Malt](https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/balcones/balcones-texas-single-malt-whisky/)). Take a look [this chart](https://www.forwhiskeylovers.com/sites/default/files/user/20168/photos/Scotch%20chart.jpg) to find something you think you might enjoy. Single malts tend to be reflective of the area for which they originate in. For example, distilleries on [Islay](http://blog.fxdurkin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/whiskymap.jpg) didn't have access to coal like the Low Lands and other regions of Scotland did, so they used peat during their malting process which imbues a degree of smokiness to Scotches originating from Islay. To get a sense of the whole process for single malt Scotch, check out the [Laphroaig Distillery Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Xo900woaU). 

I have yet to try any Scotch from Highland Park, but I would recommend that distillery. As is stated in *Michael Jackson's Complete Guide to Single Malt Scotch*, "Highland Park is the greatest all-rounder in the world of malt whisky"   

My journey into Scotch began with Jura Superstition, and I was hooked on peated Scotch. From there I delved into a quest for more smoke, Talisker 10, Ardbeg 10, Lagavulin 16, Laphroaig 18, etc. exploring the Scotches from Islay. I've had Speysides and others as well, but for me I'm drawn to peated Scotches with heavy smoke. You'll find a Scotch for each event as well - one to enjoy with a book, one to enjoy on a cold winters day at the top of your hike, and so on.

Generally speaking, you may find the 100 point system to also be helpful. A summary of what the numbers actually mean can be [found here](http://thewhiskeyjug.com/how-to-score-whiskey/)

	<TEXT> From a paleobioloigcal reference some species of coccolithophore would seem to do well in warmer waters under higher atmospheric CO2. EHUX ([Emiliania huxleyi](http://ina.tmsoc.org/Nannotax3/index.php?dir=Coccolithophores/Isochrysidales/Noelaerhabdaceae/Emiliania/Emiliania%20huxleyi)), one species of coccolithophores, thrived during the Cretaceous (with means of ~18C and 1700ppm CO2) eventually depositing the White Cliffs of Dover, iirc. It's important to note that there are cold and warm water tolerant species of coccolithophores as well. 

[Gephyrocapsa Muellerae](http://ina.tmsoc.org/Nannotax3/index.php?dir=Coccolithophores/Isochrysidales/Noelaerhabdaceae/Gephyrocapsa/Gephyrocapsa%20muellerae) is a relatively cold water species of coccolithophore and the transition between cold-water and warm-water tolerant species is frequently studied in order to understand cold and warm events throughout the geological record, such as between glacial and interglacial episodes, [Marine Isotope Stages](https://chriscolose.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/epicacore1.jpg) (MIS), for reconstructing paleoclimate records. </TEXT>

(1) End Ordovician  - A combination(?) with [climate change](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X13000154) as the tipping point.

(2) End Devonian - No clear trigger, though the 'fart cloud' you see is actually the wide spread evolution of plants, and the subsequent 'greening' of the continents.

(3) End Permian - [The Siberian Traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Traps)

(4) End Triassic - The onset of the breakup of the super continent Pangea. Climate change / volcanism.

(5) End Cretaceous - debated, though similarly to previous extinctions volcanism (Deccan Traps) likely played a role along with the bolide impact, which btw had nothing to do with the formation of the [Gulf of Mexico](http://www.lecosmographe.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Chicxulub-Crater.jpg). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While compositional similarities certainly provide good evidence in regard to orogenic relationships that method of analysis is extremely limited to episodes of, well, orogensis. I would argue that when it comes to paleogeography the two biggest ones are actually a) as you've mentioned - fossils, and b) [Paleomagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleomagnetism) which is able to place better constraints on latitudinal positions. For example, while orogenic relationships may indicate active / passive margins, it can't tell you where on the globe it's occurring. For that, you need paleomagnetism, and other linkages such as fossil indicators.

Compositional analysis is typically used to tell you *what* is going on at a certain time (uplift, subduction, extension, subsidence, transgression / regression, etc.) rather than *where* on the globe it's occurring. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well for one, I certainly care. I can study their formation, and their history can reveal important aspects in regards to earth processes throughout the geological record and how those processes may have changed over time. Understanding the processes that govern the formation of natural diamonds can also shed light on where to look, not only for more, but for related geological processes - which in turn can reveal aspects in regard to those indirect processes related to diamonds. Turn the question around, and ask what each individual synthetic diamond can tell you about the world around you...  

Besides the knowledge gained through the exploration, and discovery of natural diamonds there certainly is something special about their history. When you have an appreciation for evolutionary processes you might appreciate the processes that it took to form them under natural conditions. Who cares then, for the rare and exotic species of flower when you can just make synthetic flowers and place them in a vase, who cares about collecting iron meteorites - originating from planetary cores of planetesimals, broken apart that now reside on someones shelf, when you could just have some iron slag instead. Who cares about the original works of Leonardo Da Vinci, Vincent Van Gogh, Monet, Picasso and Caravaggio when you can just have prints. With a superficial understanding comes a superficial appreciation, only with a deeper understanding can a true appreciation arise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They may not have any radioactive decay in the first place...

Well, they do but that doesn't negate your second point, "gravitational sheer" [sic] more correctly known as [tidal heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_heating). 

... a radioactive core, like Earth.

The cores of planets are *not* the most radioactive, rather it's their crusts, while the mantle also provides heat from radioactive decay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...reduction over time of radioactive decay in the core?

Relative to the crust and the mantle, radioactivity from a planets core is negligible. Earth's heat is derived from (1) the accretion process, and impacts (formation of the Earth) (2) the [iron catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_catastrophe) and (3) radioactive decay 

Expanded on elsewhere:
There are three possible sources of heat in a planet's interior. One is the heat of accretion during its formation---dust, pebbles, and rocks stuck together as they were gravitationally attracted together in the planet's formation, releasing gravitational potential energy. A second source is during differentiation---loss of gravitational potential energy as the denser material sunk to the core. Both of those sources occur early in a planet's history. The primary source today, billions of years later, is the heat from radioactive decay of unstable atomic nuclei: uranium-238, uranium-235, thorium-232, and potassium-40.

Over time heat is lost to space and the planet cools. This process leads to the evolution of the planet and eventually the cessation of geological activity - though this takes a considerable amount of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issues arise, most likely, from estimates of total water content to begin with and I suspect from improper assumptions in thermodynamic modelling of the system. I understand the intuitive reasoning behind the theories; however, some evidence simply doesn't align with those intuitive reasons. The reasoning can be summarized as follows:

During Earth's formation temperatures should have lead to the Earth existing essentially as a 'magma ocean.' Outgassing from volcanism would have given rise to Earth's first or primary atmosphere. Following this, the giant impactor, leading to the subsequent formation of our moon, should also have given rise to a magma ocean. This would have boiled off Earth's oceans and lead to the creation of a 'dry' moon. The Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) along with volcanic outgassing would have given rise to Earth's secondary atmospheric composition. Much of this, however, is debated including Earth's early magma oceans.

Some theorize that the majority of Earth's water must have been delivered by comets during the LHB, while others insist it was delivered by asteroids (carbonaceous chondrites - CC) - the latter of which is strongly supported by the evidence. Personally, I dismiss the cometary theory as it currently stands. There's simply not enough evidence to support such a position in comparison to delivery by CC's. Volcanic degassing has always been a favourite of mine though there remain a large number of unanswered questions that remain to be modeled with a high degree of certainty. For example, what is the rate of volcanic degassing, and has it changed over time? Have the reservoirs remained constant over time or have they mixed and if they have mixed how well did they mix? How much water is present in the Earth's mantle, how well does it mix, at what rate does it mix, has that rate changed over time and what do these variables depend on and have those dependencies varied through time? These all give rise to further, more in depth questions that remain speculative and will no doubt evolve with more evidence. For example, the moon - once thought to have accreted 'dry' is actually fairly 'wet.' What then are the implications for the Earth's deep reservoirs?

The answer of where Earth's current reservoirs are derived from is thus anything but intuitive, and quite a complex question to confidently answer with supportive evidence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Out of the current evidence, [carbonaceous chondrites](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater) have remained the strongly favoured mechanism for delivering Earth's water with a further component derived from volcanic degassing. The cometary explanation for the origin of Earth's water, while tempting to contemplate, has seen little, if any, good evidence in support of the theory. In fact, the vast majority of evidence thus far [points away from cometary sources](http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/12/First_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio). Interestingly, [another study](http://www.nature.com/news/earth-has-water-older-than-the-sun-1.16011) has suggested that a considerable portion of the H2O within our solar system is likely older than our Sun - though this says little in regard to the aforementioned competing theories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a good question, and to be honest one I that I don't believe there is a definitive answer to yet. We still don't know when our present style of plate tectonics was initiated with good confidence and nor do we know exactly how the process began with good confidence. There certainly are theories but there is a fair amount of debate, back-and-forth, between them.

	<TEXT> The study you linked does not affirm your statement that Mars currently lacks active plate tectonics. If I recall correctly, the lead author suggests that there may be active plate tectonics occurring on Mars today, that it may be different from Earth's, and that if it is occurring it is occurring on much slower time scales.

Mars is at a primitive stage of plate tectonics. It gives us a glimpse of how the early Earth may have looked and may help us understand how plate tectonics began on Earth," said An Yin, a UCLA professor of Earth and space sciences and the sole author of the new research...

I don't quite understand why the plates are moving with such a large magnitude or what the rate of movement is; maybe Mars has a different form of plate tectonics," Yin said. "The rate is much slower than on Earth. - [UCLA Article](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-scientist-discovers-plate-237303)

	<TEXT> It most certainly will. Plate tectonics is driven primarily by positive and negative contrasts in buoyancy (density) that ultimately give rise to convective flow. Thus, we can infer that once the planet cools enough these processes will stop. Think of a lava lamp, for example, and what drives the motion within it (essentially differences in temperature) and now think of what happens when you turn the lava lamp off and the internal temperature cools and reaches the surrounding room temperature... convection stops. 

However, I would predict that plate tectonics will stop well before the Earth cools down that much, and will stop when the oceans are lost due to the continued increase in solar luminosity ~1.1Ga from present. [Water is a requirement for plate tectonics](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm) so far as we understand the process on Earth. </TEXT>

If it's a decaying fish like in the forefront I fail to see how you would have a difficult time recognizing that it was in fact a decaying salmon. Perhaps you're not accustomed to such environments? 

As for the watermark - that's pretty standard, and if anyone is interested in the image it can be removed as need be.

	<TEXT> Geologist here, will attempt to simplify for you. There are 3 main [carbon isotopes](http://iws.collin.edu/biopage/faculty/mcculloch/1408/notes/chemistry/images/02-04T-IsotopesOfCarbon.gif) that are typically used for analysis. When looking at stable isotopes (isotopes that don't decay, i.e. non radioactive) we can use ^12 C and ^13 C. ^13 C has 1 more neutron than ^12 C thus making it heavier than ^12 C so it moves slower - thus the rate at which ^12 C encounters an organism will occur more frequently than ^13 C. A few key metabolic enzymes can be quite finicky, presumably because of the mass, and so will 'prefer' ^12 C over ^13 C. This means then that life will be isotopically 'light' relative to the natural atmospheric composition. We can see this in the following table:



Type of organism | 13C value
---|---
C4 photosynthetic plants | -13
C3 photosynthetic plants | -28
Thermal vent microorganisms | -33



The formula for 13C can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9413C) and essentially means that when the 13C value is reported as being positive (+) it has higher amounts of the heavier isotope, in this case ^13 C in it and is therefore isotopically heavy. When the 13C value is reported as being negative (-) it means it has smaller amounts of ^13 C and is therefore isotopically light. Low values of 13C is another way of saying it is isotopically light. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello micromonas, 

Earlier in my education I compiled a report reviewing a paper similar to this paper, titled "[Early life recorded in Archean pillow lavas](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/304/5670/578)." Their arguments were certainly supportive of their interpretation; however, they also had microtextures lined with low 13C values (these are used today as being indicative of microbial life in modern basalts and ophiolites). As far as I can see from the article (not the paper itself) I would have to agree that having low 13C values within zircon is not nearly a strong enough line of evidence to definitely conclude the presence of life. That being said, we know life is older than 3.5Ga presented by the fossil record - while tantalizing, however, I remain skeptical of this teams interpretation.

	<TEXT> There appears to be some confusion around the term "[Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest)" which is why I clarified it by stating it was around the 54^th parallel - should help clear things up. I could just tell you, but that would take some of the fun out of it. While you average 3ft. of snow a year my hometown literally translates into "people of the snow" and for a very good reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I grew up on the coast of the Pacific Northwest, not too far north, but north enough (about the 54^th parallel). During the fall and winter months we would have shows, almost nightly. Some of my fondest memories are as a young teenager - I used to sneak out of my parents house, and walk over to my girlfriends at the time. On my return home, in the early hours of the morning, the air would be crisp, fresh snow on the ground, and everything was silent but for the sound of my steps and the occasional winter breeze that would meander its way through the snow covered branches of the nearby trees. Looking up into the night sky, stretching from horizon to horizon would be the norther lights - dancing about like curtains, light and dark greens, hues of purple and red as if to hide the stars that flickered behind them.

An image, forever burned into memory of another winter night, the northern lights, the stars, the moon, and comet Hale-Bopp. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even for a family of cometary objects to reduce luminosity by 22% seems unlikely. To add some perspective:

Straight away, we know were not dealing with a planet here. Even a Jupiter-sized planet only blocks roughly 1 percent of this kind of stars light, and thats about as big as a planet gets. It cant be due to a star, either; wed see it if it were. And the lack of a regular, repeating signal belies both of these as well. Whatever is blocking the star is big, though, up to half the width of the star itself! - [source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/10/14/weird_star_strange_dips_in_brightness_are_a_bit_baffling.html)

Anything in a well defined orbit, I would suspect would also have a definite periodicity to it; however, that's not the case:

...it turns out there are lots of these dips in the stars light. Hundreds. And they dont seem to be periodic at all. They have odd shapes to them, too. A planet blocking a stars light will have a generally symmetric dip; the light fades a little, remains steady at that level, then goes back up later. The dip at 800 days in the KIC 8462852 data doesnt do that; it drops slowly, then rises more rapidly. Another one at 1,500 days has a series of blips up and down inside the main dips. Theres also an apparent change in brightness that seems to go up and down roughly every 20 days for weeks, then disappears completely. Its likely just random transits, but still. Its bizarre.

What ever we're observing, it's fascinating to say the least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While you can date the C14 in bones, teeth, antlers, etc. C14 dating is only accurate (under typical methods) for dating material no older than ~50,000 years. Therefore, this sample - dating between 80,000ka - 120,000ka could not have used radiocarbon dating. You could date layers above and below the layer containing the teeth to constrain the dates using other radiometric dating techniques (as was the case here), though caution must be taken in order to ensure that no [re-working](https://vmnhpaleontology.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/reworked-fossils-part-1/) has occurred. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Predominantly chalk (a relatively soft, white, fine-grained variety of limestone, CaCO3) formed in the Late Cretaceous epoch, between 66 and 100 million years ago ([90](http://cpgeosystems.com/090_Cretaceous_3globes.jpg)Ma, [105](http://cpgeosystems.com/105_Cretaceous_2globes.jpg)Ma) - though there is some flint and quartz as well. When microscopic organisms, (in this case primarily [Coccolithophores](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-iS9pVjHjew/S-ryKTJ7Y3I/AAAAAAAAFco/jXjVBJgv7pU/s1600/chalk.png) -  a type of phytoplankton) die, their shells sink to the sea floor, mix with lime muds, and eventually harden into chalk deposits. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in February (2015) geobiologist [Nora Noffke](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642127717) published her research in the journal Astrobiology: [Ancient Sedimentary Structures in the 3.7 Ga Gillespie Lake Member, Mars, That Resemble Macroscopic Morphology, Spatial Associations, and Temporal Succession in Terrestrial Microbialites](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2014.1218?journalCode=ast). Her findings, however, were rather quickly dismissed (if I recall correctly) or left to remain inconclusive as Curiosity continued along to other target areas. </TEXT>
