	<TEXT> I would just wonder what the point of using the wrong verb was. You read a book. You listen to an audiobook. Read does not mean the same thing as listen. I just think it's stupid people are embarrassed enough about listening to an audiobook that they choose to use the wrong verb to describe their actions. I mean who gives a shit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, right? And I'm actually a fan of audiobooks. I think people are self conscious about listening to audiobooks instead of reading them for whatever reason and that's why they get weird about it, but thats stupid. There's no shame in listening to an audiobook. But I don't get why someone would say they read a book when they actually didn't read anything, it's just a poor choice of words at best, or being disingenuous at worst. No one would go see a Shakespeare play or watch a movie version of a book and then say they read it, just because the original medium was written words.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd be ok with spending a decent amount of money but I was hoping to find a company that will do something like guarantee if you see any more bugs within like six months or something they would come back out for free. Have not been able to find this as of yet. Anyone have any luck with this or know any major companies that do this? 

Edit: I'm in south Florida if anyone happens to be from the area.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe a stupid question but what is the best way to apply cimexa to a couch? I have the kind of couches that is a wood base with fabric cushions on top. I'll put it all over the wood and the bottom of cushions but I can't put it on top where I sit right? That would not be healthy right?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because people are animals. Literally. So we have always had that carnal capacity for violence. Compound that with as our brains got bigger and we became self aware many people just can't deal with the absurdity of life and not having an answer to ultimate metaphysical questions of what's the point of it all and all that shit. So we made up bullshit divisive religions and bullshit nation states that go back to our basic tribalistic predilections of always being on our guard in our own little groups and having enemies. Also greed and profit motive contributing to extreme inequality doesn't help in modern times. But greed goes all the way back too right? It's the fighting over resources that are limited and the feeling you never have enough to be secure, you have to always keep fighting for survival, this is instinct, even though at this point it may be irrational. 

Humans have good qualities too like empathy and having a "conscious" but ultimately that just goes back to a basic evolutionary understanding that what's good for my group is good for me and basic ideas of reciprocity and whatnot. 

TLDR: Humans are shitty by nature. This probably sounds pretty cynical, so sorry, I maybe drank too much whiskey.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought it was great. Good job OP. 

The other post said the character lacked diffidence (which I had to look up and means - modesty or shyness resulting from a lack of self-confidence) and because of this they couldn't bare it. I disagree. 

This is from Wikipedia - Prufrock laments his physical and intellectual inertia, the lost opportunities in his life and lack of spiritual progress, and he is haunted by reminders of unattained carnal love. With visceral feelings of weariness, regret, embarrassment, longing, emasculation, sexual frustration, a sense of decay, and an awareness of mortality.

I think the film does really capture the spirit of the thing. Again, great job.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "...telling the television interviewer Katie Couric in 2005 that "I've got plenty of money, more money than I ever dreamed I would have. But I am not a billionaire." She has remained publicly silent on the subject since."

"So I set out this week to assess the size and scope of her fortune, not to invade her privacy but because she's that all-too-rare commodity in the ranks of the ultrawealthy - a role model."

I'm not sure that makes any sense.. Sure seems like he is invading her privacy... And because he thinks she's a role model?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go for it! There's also a great audiobook version on YouTube. This is a book I found very helpful to hear aloud as well as reading it. And if you don't want to get a guide book there is always summaries online if you get stuck on a particularly hard part.  </TEXT>
