	<TEXT> I think you need to breath also. Have you been holding your breath in anticipation of something? You might be oxygen deprived. Seriously, no cars? Because they "seal up the ground"? There are tribes in the Amazon and Africa that might take you in. Although, I doubt they have internet and thus I will never get an update from you about how your dream to become a 14th century BC nomad turned out. Good luck though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I, personally, think www.reuters.com is one of the most unbiased, but there are probably no unbiased news sources. What I do is digest A LOT of news from everywhere, specifically getting news from those that I feel are biased against my own views also. Getting the same stories from both sides of the biased spectrum and seeing what is similar or what facts stay the same is probably the only way to get a total view of what is really going on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although, technically possible, I personally think it would be a disaster for many reasons. 1) as mentioned, Hacking. Not just vote minipulation, but I bet we would have a much higher percentage of people voting without actually having more people vote, if you know what I mean. 2) This removing of another step in the effort to get involved in politics, if even voting every couple/few years, would turn it into a circus with clowns instead of the quazi-humans we have running government now. 3) Finally, the amount of privacy lost to do this would be HUGE! I mean, to be able to reliably know who is voting and why they are voting (harassment, forced, etc). Our cellphones would have to be publicly monitored much like they are, presumably, doing now behind the backs of the public.    
    
     
Now, I do think you could take many of those issues and modify them to a direct vote application.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I don't have the time now, but after rereading it, I think it is just stylistic differences, but I would like to reformat it later, if you don't mind.     
      
     
Can you tell me a bit about the inspiration for this? The content seems self explanatory, but what caused the idea or first few lines to flow?    
    

Edit: I started, twice, rewriting it, but feel a bit foolish doing so. If you get around to sharing your inspiration I will probably leave it at that, and you are, obviously, not obligated to do even that. Thanks again for the share.  </TEXT>

I grew up with an alcoholic mother who had agoraphobia. I have heard A LOT about panic attacks from her and others and I do not envy those who get panic attacks. I get anxiety attacks, but they are nothing compared to wanting to die. I do hope it is a phase. I do not mean to rain on that hope, but you should be able to look at family and personal history to give you an idea if this is passing or just a shitty occasional tribulation.  Either way, know that you are not even remotely alone.

	<TEXT> All I wanted was a little love    
But all you could give me was a little shove    
Into a murky pool of social isolation    
Now Im drowning and naked    
Cuzz you couldnt make it     
To hear this poem being read    
Though even that gives me voice, though no choice    
To get out these words, you might think absurd     
Yet I have no doubt, that without them     
I wouldnt have found a way     
To be here tomorrow    
Let alone, today     

I remember when you held me by my shirt collar    
You screamed and you hollered    
You had a knife in your hand    
Stabbed it into the night stand    
  asked me how I wanted to die    
But in the 5th grade     
Dad  I still thought you were the greatest guy

	<TEXT> Those are swing states. In these states not only is there the need for a candidate with a highly polished resume (Hillary's being quite tarnished), but someone who can bring people to the voting booth. I believe that almost ANYONE other than Clinton could have won. Conservatives rallied against her on specific, if not valid, points and "progressives" were SUPER sore about how the DNC treated Sanders. Unless we are in WWIII, I highly doubt that my 2 yr old would lose to Trump next election. Biden had all the good about Clinton without much, if any, of the bad. If he runs next election, Biden will probably win....unless there is another highly motivated progressive.     


     
TLDR: Biden had all the good and none of the bad of Clinton and those swing states, along with most of the rest, actually had low turnout.  </TEXT>
