	<TEXT> As an employee, I totally agree. As an employer, I disagree. If I know that your market worth is 30k, and I'm only paying 20k. I know you won't stay long. I'd rather employ someone at 20k who was on 15k. They'll be happier, work harder, and stay longer. Of course I'm generalising, but when employing, you need to reduce risk of someone leaving. So, as employees, whether we like it or not, it's still a valid question.

"Well, not explicitly, but you were telling me to do something so it's polite to look at you for starters. You also didn't tell me NOT to look at you, and there are an infinite number of things I'm doing right now that you didn't ask me to do; a lot of which you'd probably be annoyed if I didn't do, like breathing, or standing on two legs, rather than one. So you using an argument like 'did I ask you to do that?' Is quite frankly a load of balderdash. If you give me set of parameters defining what you wish for me to do and not do, anything else outside of these is room for my creativity... sir" </TEXT>

It can always be exploited in the same way that Nazis exploited the infrastructure set up before them by well meaning people.

	<TEXT> The dots are part of the letters, like an i or j and do not change the letter. The vowels aren't separate letters in Arabic (except an A but that's different)    
 = b  
A dash above the letter means it is followed by an a sound:  
 = ba  
A dash below the letter means it is followed by an e sound:  
 = be  
And a little open apostrophe like thing means it's an oo sound
 = bo 
The "open" dot over the  is a bit like a circle and as someone else pointed out this means that the syllable stops there. Like "club".  
In the same way that you can read English if the letters are rearranged or vowels stripped out, Arab speakers can still read with out the diacritics (the accents, or lines). However, sometimes it can lead to a subtle difference.

Not knocking the car, but it's not great off road, and not great on road. It tries to be both and doesn't do well in either. Try and decide if you want to go onto dunes or not. If you do, get a real 4x4. If not, you can get a better hatchback for the same money. I've got a fair bit of experience on and off road (including track) and always look to get best bang for buck on a car (rather than waste money on something useless).

	<TEXT> Then why not have a gif(v)? The point is that if you know there is no sound in the sub Reddit, you know browsing it is safe, and won't accidentally blast out your speakers because you forgot to mute them. Also, gifv is much lower bit rate than gif anyway </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He said he remembers "this morning". The phrase "this morning" can be used to either refer to:  
A) a specific morning that he was talking about or  
B) the morning of today  
The example in "A" usually requires that the writer previously mentioned the context/time. E.g. "It was the day we met... I remember this morning..."  
so without context, it usually means "today's morning" so he was actually saying that he remembers today, like it was yesterday.  
Also to "remember X like it was yesterday" is used to describe an event long ago but remembered so clearly hat it could have only been yesterday.  
So if OP remembers today, like it was yesterday, he's actually forgetting it very quickly! :)  
It was subtle, and he's not incorrect, I was just picking up on it to make it funny :)

	<TEXT> I understand what you are saying. But there's a difference between eliminating someone because you don't think you're a good match, and eliminating someone before even meeting them based on where they were born.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But why did you feel the need to declare it if it makes no difference? If the intent was to make the process efficient, then you have eliminated someone based on their nationality without even meeting them. If you were still happy to meet and judge based on their character, then the statement was irrelevant and divisive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a westerner myself, I too would probably choose another westerner because of cultural compatibility. However, some of my best friends come from other background and would happily live with them. What upset me was the advertisement of the preference. It kind of puts off non westerners straight away, even if they would have been a fantastic candidate. If you didn't implicitly eliminate all non westerners, that doesn't mean you couldn't still opt for a westerner which you ended up preferring. It's the sweeing generalisation which wasn't needed.  
P.S. Are you from NZ? How much more Eastern can you get? ;) </TEXT>
