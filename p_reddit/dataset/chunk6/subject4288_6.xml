	<TEXT>  Now you're just splitting hairs. Most folks in the LGBT community don't care about dated comments like that at all.... these are the kinds of things LGBT folks care about. No one is going to say well he's put his career on the line defending our rights, but look at that awful joke he made all of that time ago!

No, I'm not splitting hairs. There is a huge difference between opposing marriage equality on religious grounds and expressing general hatred towards a persecuted minority group. 

 That's my point, if you're looking for a squeaky clean candidate you're going to have a bad time. None of them exist, and this mindset is why we can never have anyone good. You have half the Dems thinking Bernie is disqualified for taking a honeymoon in soviet Russia and the other half forgot how homophobic this country was 10 years ago.

I disagree. Obama was squeaky clean; Clinton lost the election because she talked to bankers and used a private email server. Bernie would have lost the election because he had some nice things to say about socialist dictators and a wrote an essay about women wanting rape. For the record, I'm sure Sanders would have been a good president and Clinton would have been a great president - but it's more important to get somebody elected at this point, and we shouldn't start with somebody who needs to apologize for hateful comments.  </TEXT>

I'm not prejudiced against people who don't believe in gods - I certainly don't - but I'll happily admit I'm prejudiced against capital-A Atheists.

	<TEXT>  Hillary had some choice words about the definition of marriage and that didn't stop her from garnering LGBT support.

Sure, but there's a lot of space between a Christian commenting on the traditional Christian definition of marriage and "not liking the homosexuals" and using homosexual as a slur. FWIW, I also don't think Gabbard is a good idea.

 LGBT folks care more about what a politician will do to protect their rights, not some cherry picked quote from another time period. I do see where you're coming from though. 

Honestly, if anything is clear after this last election its that it is far more important for the Dem. candidate to be **squeaky** clean than to have experience and accomplishments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, each of the nodes have two six-core Westmere Xeon CPUs, 24 GB of RAM, and three Tesla M2070 GPUs. 

Those CPUs are similar to a Core i7-970 underclocked by about 20% - that should be no problem - and each one of those GPUs are full-sized but low-clocked Fermi chips, so about the equivalent of a severely undervolted GTX 480. 

So, since Crysis runs on Linux natively now, you should be able to comfortably run Crysis on each of the sixty CUDA-capable nodes. Of course, they don't have any display ports or I/O aside from InfiniBand, so there would be some serious latency issues... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There seems to be a lot of disdain for people who label themselves as Atheists on SRD which is odd as, going by the statistics, it seems like atheists/ non-religious people are far more likely to share the kind of views that people on SRD have, ex. being pro LGBT, tending towards left wing, and being pro choice. It's true that Atheists have a generally dim view of religious people, but more often than not that view is still higher than the respective religious peoples view of atheists.

I think that's because people who label themselves as Atheists (with a capital "A") tend to be the ones who are condescending and obnoxious at best, and misogynistic, racist, or social Darwinist at worst, and they don't want to be associated with those people. 

To me, there isn't much of a reason to make atheism a part of your identity except to laugh at religious people. (And most of the time, "religious" is "rural, non-white, and/or lower-class.") </TEXT>

Yeah, he needed to win a feud after losing to AJ a dozen times, but  putting the IC belt on him was a huge mistake. Its been sapping his face heat since he's constantly in multi-man events he can't possibly win, and its sapping the belt's credibility since he's treating it like an afterthought. 

And now he's feuding with Baron Corbin, who also badly needs wins. Corbin should have beaten the Miz for the IC and then dropped it to Ambrose at Mania.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Also very true! Although I'm not sure if they use Intel or AMD I would imagine they use supercomputers based off of something else. But yeah they would be huge customers

Nearly all medium-to-large large computing facilities use Intel, and most of the remainder use AMD. It is usually much easier and cheaper to use modular, multi-socket nodes with x86-x64 CPUs (and CUDA GPUs) than specialized hardware. Most of the highest-performing use [Haswell-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500#Number_of_systems) CPUs. 

The one I use for my work uses [Westmere CPUs and Fermi GPUs](https://www.westgrid.ca/support/systems/Parallel)  :( </TEXT>

Finally, Gates can already live like a king.

	<TEXT> Proprietary software is software that is copyrighted and privately owned, like Microsoft Windows. Most of the code you use on a day-to-day basis is probably proprietary. Generally, you are not allowed to modify or distribute this code yourself - you can't open up Windows and see how it works, and you can't modify if, or sell (or give away) your own TioFrodo Presents Microsoft Windows!

Open-source software has it's source code publicly available, and is free to use, modify, and distribute. Firefox, the GNU compilers, and the Linux kernels are open source.  

[Collaborationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborationism) is collaborating with the enemy against one's own people. **Collaborationist**/*Collaborationniste* typically refers to someone who willingly cooperated with the Nazis in occupied Europe. 

Edit: I'd like to add that both types of software are necessary and valuable. Open-source development is often conducted by hobbyists, academic institutions, or in free time, so quality open-source software takes a long time to mature and is usually limited to academic/technical stuff (like the GNU compilers, Visual MD, etc.) or stuff with a very, very wide userbase (like Firefox.) Stuff that requires a big initial investment or is time-sensitive like triple-A games, or requires confidential code or super-strict version control can't be done open-source. Open source stuff is also often poorly documented and not super user-friendly (being developed mainly by techies without front-office staff.) </TEXT>

I'm a bit annoyed by this. Not for any ideological reasons, mind you - I'm just frustrated by Toady's strange priorities, slow pace of work, and C-- level of coding skill.   </TEXT>

 Not being a dick, but the whole Show vs. Shaq thing was almost guaranteed to be awful.

I mean sure, it probably was going to suck, but this was obviously important to Show. He put in the work and Shaq blew him off. Not only is that insulting, it also cost him a prominent Wrestlemania slot (and the money that comes with that,) probably his last chance at one.

If you are suggesting generating new fuel **directly** from sunlight, this obviously isn't practical - the energy required to create new matter is enormous: twenty-five million kilowatt-hours -- or the equivalent of two and a half million litres of gasoline -- per gram.

If you are suggesting creating a plant, algae, or chemical cocktail that can store chemical energy in a way that can be more easily accessed in fewer steps than what we have now (GM corn + GM soy - ethanol + soybean oil - biodiesel,) than I agree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It isnt as though poor white people are living much better than their minority counterparts.

White people have significantly more upward economic mobility due to [biased hiring practices]( http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873) and a significantly smaller likelihood for arrest, conviction, or disproportionately long prison sentences for drug offences, for example. 

But what is the imperative for changing economic conditions for poor black people, and not just all poor people?

Removing this bias. So long as black people are disproportionately poor, they will be treated poorly. Stereotyping is a problem.  </TEXT>
