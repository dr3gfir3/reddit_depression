	<TEXT> As noted in her post, the source of the 9 criteria from the [DSM-5](http://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/dsm-5) is APA (2013).

Here is a recent [publication](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-57712-001/) that tested the reliability and validity of 4 survey instruments to measure IGD on the basis of the 9 criteria from the DSM5. Results:

The dichotomous 9-item IGD scale showed solid psychometric properties and was the most practical scale for diagnostic purposes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The volunteers whom the earlier round of testing indicated were 'addicted' to the Internet reported increased negative moods after they stopped surfing the net, suffering a 'comedown' that researchers said was not unlike that experienced by people after using the drug ecstasy.

	<TEXT> I agree, the issue of stigma is an important one to address, and I discussed it elsewhere in the thread. There is definitely stigma attached to gaming, and people may (incorrectly) regard it as strange, odd, or even anti-social at times. I think that any activity that someone uses to distract themselves from properly coping/dealing with a psychological disorder, or an activity that causes someone to risk opportunities (e.g., employment) or relationships, or any of the other criteria, is typically not ideal. But, again, it all depends on the patient and their unique context. The Internet and gaming culture is relatively new (and isn't going away anytime soon), so scientists are playing a bit of catch up. The fact that these authors discuss the pros and cons of brain network hyperconnectivity suggests an important shift in discourse, though. 

Concerning the criteria, I found this recent [publication](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-57712-001/) that tested the reliability and validity of 4 survey instruments to measure IGD on the basis of the 9 criteria from the DSM5. Results:

 The psychometric properties of these scales were tested among a representative sample of 2,444 Dutch adolescents and adults, ages 1340 years. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the structural validity (i.e., the dimensional structure) of all scales was satisfactory. Both types of assessment (polytomous and dichotomous) were also reliable (i.e., internally consistent) and showed good criterion-related validity, as indicated by positive correlations with time spent playing games, loneliness, and aggression and negative correlations with self-esteem, prosocial behavior, and life satisfaction. **The dichotomous 9-item IGD scale showed solid psychometric properties and was the most practical scale for diagnostic purposes**.

	<TEXT> Yes, there is definitely stigma attached to gaming, and people may (incorrectly) regard it as strange, odd, or even anti-social at times (I like your Slash example - to me, that behaviour seems just as problematic as gaming 24/7, and reads like a typical behavioural addiction). I think that any activity that someone uses to distract themselves from properly coping/dealing with a psychological disorder, or an activity that causes someone to risk opportunities (e.g., employment) or relationships, is *typically* not ideal. But, again, it all depends on the patient and their unique context. The Internet and gaming culture is relatively new (and isn't going away anytime soon), so scientists are playing a bit of catch up. The fact that these authors discuss the pros and cons of brain network hyperconnectivity suggests an important shift in discourse, though.

	<TEXT> Your example, termed exercise addiction in some circles, falls under the 'behavioural addiction' umbrella term. Right now, gambling is the only behavioural (i.e., non-substance) addiction in the [DSM-5](http://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/dsm-5). Research on behavioural addictions is certainly ongoing, with APA recognizing the need for further research (in the case of IGD). 

Another important thing to note is that with any behavioural addiction, there is often a significant degree of comorbidity with other diagnosable mental health disorders:

 About 86% of Internet addiction cases have some other DSM-IV diagnosis present. [source](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07101556)

What this means is that it is possible that an exercise disorder, or an Internet gaming disorder, may simply be a symptom of something else. It is clear that more research is needed, which is why APA listed IGD in [DSM-5](http://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/dsm-5) Section III. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Internet addiction disorder is a related but different disorder, and like IGD, is not listed in the [DSM-5](http://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/dsm-5). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, some research does suggest that. I found [this](http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/2005/04000/Gender_Differences_and_Related_Factors_Affecting.8.aspx):

 This study found that subjects who had previously played online games were predominantly male. Gender differences were also found in the severity of online gaming addiction and motives for playing. Older age, lower self-esteem, and lower satisfaction with daily life were associated with more severe addiction among males, but not among females. Special strategies accounting for gender differences must be implemented to prevent adolescents with risk factors from becoming addicted to online gaming.

As noted by APA,

 By listing Internet Gaming Disorder in DSM-5 Section III, APA hopes to encourage research to determine whether the condition should be added to the manual as a disorder.

Hopefully more research will be conducted that includes women to examine gender differences.

	<TEXT> Sure. But in this specific case, your baseline is boredom, whereas someone from a clinical population may be playing games to manage an anxiety disorder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're asking a lot of interesting questions, but I don't think that answering them would be constructive to the overall discussion. One thing to keep in mind is what the [DSM-5](http://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/dsm-5) is used for. The DSM-5 is: 

 used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders. The criteria are concise and explicit, intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settingsinpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. 

The criteria are a tool used to facilitate an objective assessment by a mental health professional. Such assessments always involve the consideration of specific, contextual factors unique to the patient in question.

Also keep in mind that these are proposed criteria:

 In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Internet Gaming Disorder is identified in Section III as a condition warranting more clinical research and experience before it might be considered for inclusion in the main book as a formal disorder.

Edit: I found this recent [publication](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-57712-001/) that tested the reliability and validity of 4 survey instruments to measure IGD on the basis of the 9 criteria from the DSM5. Results:

 The psychometric properties of these scales were tested among a representative sample of 2,444 Dutch adolescents and adults, ages 1340 years. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the structural validity (i.e., the dimensional structure) of all scales was satisfactory. Both types of assessment (polytomous and dichotomous) were also reliable (i.e., internally consistent) and showed good criterion-related validity, as indicated by positive correlations with time spent playing games, loneliness, and aggression and negative correlations with self-esteem, prosocial behavior, and life satisfaction. The dichotomous 9-item IGD scale showed solid psychometric properties and was the most practical scale for diagnostic purposes.

	<TEXT> Good point, but keep in mind the prevalence rates of IGD: 

 The [DSM-5](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201407/internet-gaming-disorder-in-dsm-5) states that Internet Gaming Disorder is most common in male adolescents 12 to 20 years of age.

In this case, the inclusion of only males in an initial study is justified - I hope that future research will examine both genders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In this example, the difference is clinical. So, your motivations for gaming - as a seemingly well-adjusted person - would be different from the motivations of someone from a clinical population. As I understand it, your goal is to foster positive feelings, whereas their goal may be emotion regulation. And this isn't even discussing the addiction side of things. I touched on this in another [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3yip1x/brain_scans_show_compulsive_gamers_have/cydzghj). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but there is an important difference between someone playing a game for the sake of playing a game (i.e., fun, enjoyment, escape), and someone playing a game to 'escape' their negative thoughts and emotions (via distraction). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think IGD is the umbrella term proposed by APA, and includes offline video games as well. Your experiences of using gaming to 'escape' are very common. This is exactly why there is much discussion of whether IGD is caused by gaming itself (and related to impulse control disorder, compulsive gambling), or whether it is an effect of other personality disorders (like you mentioned, using gaming to 'escape'), or some combination of the two (this is most likely). Internet and gaming addiction are newly emergent disorders so research is ongoing. </TEXT>
