	<TEXT> Amy Adams. I really don't understand the praise she gets at all. She's never convinced me that she's playing a character and not just acting. Also I don't find her very attractive. Don't get me wrong she's not hideous or anything but I can't see her 'beauty' or how 'hot' she is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the same reason they love Nightmare before Christmas. It's quirky and dark and has a love story that's not perfect. Not saying fit girls can't fantasize, but anyone who is below average/overweight/unnatractive is going to fantasize more heavily about opportunities they wish they had. Harley is a powerhouse yet at the same time she's very vulnerable and has been a victim to the Joker.  

I know exactly where you're coming from with this, there's a lot of specific stories and characters that for some reason are very popular with overweight females and these are the only correlations I've found. People will disagree and get pissy but I've seen a pattern. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many years ago when the game first came out I made a lot of specific builds. I'm heavy into role play when it comes to elder scrolls and I love the challenge. One of my builds that I really loved was a white mage who could not kill. I took Uthgerd as a follower her and married her. I know it's not exactly what youre asking for but I came very close to being Uthgerd's follower and all I was allowed to do was heal and buff her.  </TEXT>
