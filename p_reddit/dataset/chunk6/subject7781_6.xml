	<TEXT> Look, I don't reason backward from the conclusion I think makes sense. I look at the reports and what they're saying. I look for other sources, independent from the first, and see what they are saying. I look at inconsistencies and ambiguities, as well as at what critics are saying. *Then* I compare the new information to my mental model of the world to see whether and how it all fits in.

This process has served me well in the past. For instance, based on analysis by former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter, I was pretty confident there were no WMD in Iraq before the invasion. 

Here, pretty much every reputable media outlet, as well as local activists via social media, are describing symptoms of a neurotoxic agent that Syrian rebels are unlikely to have. Western governments have cone to the same conclusion. Thesh back is coming from Assad and the Kremlin, who have no credibility on this issue. 

I have questions, of course, including about why Assad would use these weapons now and how he got his hands on them. Similarly, I'd like to see forensic tests corroborating that a nerve agent was used.

But with that all said, I simply don't find the idea of carting in bodies persuasive. I don't think media organizations are part of a massive coordinated conspiracy. I don't buy Russia's self-serving narrative. And I'm appalled by the human suffering caused by these vicious attacks. 

That doesn't mean that I support a military interventionparticularly a unilateral one. I don't Trust Trump to handle this crisis. But I do think something has to be done by the international community. As long as.Russia continues to back Assad, options are limited.

	<TEXT> Yeah, that doesn't help at all. 

What they're saying, implicitly, is that they *knew* something was dodgy about Flynn--the man who they entrusted with the highest level of security clearance in order to review, digest, and assess national security issues and brief the President. 

Right. *That* guy needed supervision. By the President's top political strategist. Even if Flynn were squeaky clean, that would raise serious issues. And that generous interpretation is refuted by basically everything that's publicly known about him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are some articles discussing experts' views of the weapons likely to have been used.

----------
###[TL:DR]

--------

The victims' (supposedly fake) symptoms suggest that a nerve agent, like Sarin, was used in this attack. The Syrian Rebels are highly unlikely to have the ability to covertly manufacture, transport, and store nerve agents. Moreover, nerve agents are unlikely to have been stored in a manner that could have caused them to be released by accident in an airstrike, and if stored that way would likely have been destroyed (nerve agents are binary, and unless mixed, won't have the neurotoxic effect).

In addition, there is other forensic and circumstantial evidence inconsistent with the Russian version of events (*e.g.*, lack of a fire, timing of the Russian claim) and no evidence for that version has been proffered, according to the articles below.

[**BBC -- Syria chemical 'attack': What we know**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39500947)

**Is Russia's explanation credible?**

**Hamish de Bretton-Gordon**, a former commanding officer of the British Armed Forces Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment, said it was "pretty fanciful".

"Axiomatically, if you blow up Sarin, you destroy it," he told the BBC.

"It's very clear it's a Sarin attack," he added. "The view that it's an al-Qaeda or rebel stockpile of Sarin that's been blown up in an explosion, I think is completely unsustainable and completely untrue."

...

The UK's representative to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, also told the Security Council that his country had seen nothing to suggest that any non-state actors in Syria had the sort of chemical weapons that would have been consistent with the symptoms.

Francois Delattre of France meanwhile said there was "no fire" after the air strike, even though a strike on an ammunition depot "would have caused a fire".

It was also not clear why there was several hours' difference between the time of the strike reported by multiple witnesses and that stated by Russia.

-------

[**CNN -- What we know about Syria's chemical weapons**](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/05/middleeast/syria-sarin-chemical-weapons-explainer/index.html)


**Dan Kaszeta**, a chemical weapons specialist and managing director of Strongpoint Security, told CNN that the Russian version of events was "highly implausible."

All the nerve agents used in the Syrian conflict so far have been binary nerve agents, he said, which are mixed from different components within a few days of use. This is done because of the difficulties of handling agents such as Sarin, which has a very short shelf life, he said.

"Nerve agents are the result of a very expensive, exotic, industrial chemical process -- these are not something you just whip up," he said.

The idea that the Syrian opposition would be able to build the covert supply chain to make a nerve agent and then would move it around and store it in a warehouse, rather than a bunker, makes no sense, Kaszeta said.

"It's much more plausible that Assad, who's used nerve agents in the past, is using them again," he said.

OPCW investigators have accused ISIS of using sulfur mustard, a blister agent, in Iraq and Syria. But Kaszeta said there was no comparison, since sulfur mustard -- widely used in Saddam Hussein's Iraq -- is much easier to come by, is far less lethal and has a long shelf life.

**Charles Lister**, a senior fellow at the US-based Middle East Institute, also rejected the Russian account of what happened as "laughable."

"Are we seriously meant to believe that the opposition has a latent chemical weapons capability, and yet somehow, it has only ever suffered the effects of its own weapons and failed to use them itself?" he said.

What happened in Khan Sheikhoun "is an almost exact replication of what we saw in the summer of 2013," Lister told CNN, adding that it had targeted a key staging area for an opposition push into northern Hama late last month.

Lister also highlighted the issue that all nerve agents known to be in Syria are binary weapons.

"First of all, nobody in their right mind would ever store both both components of a binary nerve agent in the same building. And secondly, even if they were stored together and then targeted, blowing them up would not result in any active nerve agent -- it's chemically impossible," he said.

[**Al Jazeera -- 'Chemical attack' in Syria draws international outrage**](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/chemical-attack-syria-170404195457304.html)

**Charles Duelfer**, a chemical weapons expert in Washington DC, said it was "unlikely" that the attack was not the work of the Syrian regime.

"What changed is the nature of the agent," he told Al Jazeera. "There were previous cases where the OPCW [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons] and the UN have identified that the regime used a chemical but it's only been chlorine. This agent appears to be a military agent which is far more effective." 

Duelfer also said it was "puzzling" why government forces appeared to have resorted to using chemical weapons at a time when they are doing well militarily on the ground.

"They [chemical weapons] are not really serving a substantial military purpose. They can certainly spread terror, and they certainly seem to have a political effect, although it's hard for me to calculate how that would be a positive thing for Bashar al-Assad right now - unless he wants to demonstrate that he's there, no matter what anyone else says or wants to do about it."

What chemical agent was involved?

This won't be known for sure until tests are carried out but medical experts report symptoms consistent with the use of nerve agents, which include Sarin.

The World Health Organization says the victims' symptoms are consistent with exposure to nerve agents, pointing to "the apparent lack of external injuries" and "acute respiratory distress as the main cause of death."
Doctors without Borders, or MSF, said a team providing support to the emergency department of Bab Al Hawa hospital in Idlib province had "confirmed that patients' symptoms are consistent with exposure to a neurotoxic agent such as Sarin gas."

[**Doctors without borders -- Syria: Khan Sheikhoun Victims Show Symptoms Consistent with Exposure to Chemical Substances**](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/syria-khan-sheikhoun-victims-show-symptoms-consistent-exposure-chemical-substances)

Doctors Without Borders/Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) medical team supporting the emergency department at Bab Al Hawa Hospital in Syria's Idlib Province has confirmed that patients' symptoms are consistent with exposure to a neurotoxic agent.

A number of victims of the April 4 attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun were brought to the hospital, located about 60 miles to the north, near the Turkish border. Eight people who were examined by MSF staff displayed symptoms consistent with exposure to an agent such as sarin gas or similar compounds, including constricted pupils, muscle spasms and involuntary defecation.

	<TEXT> I provided one link to a report exemplifying the claim. At the time I wrote the comment, I'd also read other reports. 

The article I linked to quoted an expert, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who was interviewed by the BBC. 

Here's the excerpt from that article discussing his comments:

A chemical weapons expert, Col Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, told the BBC that the Russian version of events was "pretty fanciful".

The idea that a nerve gas like Sarin could spread after a weapons manufacturing process had been bombed was "unsustainable", he added.

Here's a fuller excerpt from the BBC, which also included statements by British and French officials concerning other aspects of the Russian claim:

[**Syria chemical 'attack': What we know**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39500947)

**Is Russia's explanation credible?**

**Hamish de Bretton-Gordon**, a former commanding officer of the British Armed Forces Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment, said it was "pretty fanciful".

"Axiomatically, if you blow up Sarin, you destroy it," he told the BBC.

It was also not clear why there was several hours' difference between the time of the strike reported by multiple witnesses and that stated by Russia.

Moscow's short account gave no evidence for its suggestion that a group was sending chemical weaponry to Iraq. The so-called Islamic State group, which has used sulphur mustard in Syria and Iraq, is not present in Khan Sheikhoun.


But there are several other experts who have come to the same conclusion. Here's a CNN report quoting two different chemical weapons experts:


[**What we know about Syria's chemical weapons**](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/05/middleeast/syria-sarin-chemical-weapons-explainer/index.html)


**Dan Kaszeta**, a chemical weapons specialist and managing director of Strongpoint Security, told CNN that the Russian version of events was "highly implausible."

Here's a third expert quoted by Al Jazeera, who also noted that Russia's version was unlikely even though he also questioned why Assad would do this for military reasons and speculated about political reasons:

[**'Chemical attack' in Syria draws international outrage**](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/chemical-attack-syria-170404195457304.html)

Further independent confirmation of symptoms consistent with a nerve agent:

	<TEXT> This presumes that quick legislation is desirable...

No it doesn't. I said "quicker to adapt." That's not the same as "quick legislation." There's an entire procedure for notice, publication in the Federal Register of proposed rules, public comment, and revision prior to finalization of administrative regs. This procedure is defined by the [Administrative Procedure Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Procedure_Act_\(United_States\)), a federal statute. Failure to adhere to this defined process can invalidate a regulation--just as failure to account for concerns raised during the comment period can make a reg vulnerable to attack in the Courts. Deference doesn't mean abdication of judicial review--just a refusal to second guess when there interpretation of the statute is reasonable and the record supports the promulgated rule. 

Adaptability just means that rules can be updated--and in many cases more narrowly targeted and less burdensome--as new, previously unknown science or empirical research into the effectiveness of existing regulations becomes known. This process can take years and involve extensive, non-partisan studies of the subjects of regulation. Similarly, you can implement technical fixes that aren't based on policy, but drafting or other kinds of errors. You shouldn't infer that adaptability *necessarily* means hasty rule-making. We can talk about concrete examples if you'd like. 

Rapidity is forming regulation and law leaves the citizen's head spinning and is ripe for corruption...

What do you think of the AHCA--which would regulate a fifth of the economy--going from draft to committee to potentially the House floor in 17 days? There's no inherent guarantee that the legislative process will be more deliberate, fact-based, or gradual. If anything, Congress is *more* politicized, ideological, and ripe for corruption.

Expertise in the field isn't really required for effective legislation...

It absolutely is, particularly in areas like banking, environmental protection, food and drug safety, or communications technology. Unless you want the sorts of heavy-handed command and control-type obligations that more market-oriented people purport to abhor. Subjecting technical areas to the gridlocked, highly-politicized, and increasingly dysfunctional legislative process by laypersons would not be an improvement. Congress has every right not to delegate authority if it doesn't believe regulation should exist in a particular area. Or it can revoke authority if it is badly used. But if Congress does delegate, specifying competing policies to be promoted and standards to be followed in doing so, it can make a lot of sense to let the nitty-gritty rules be designed and implemented by subject-matter experts with comments from stakeholders and the public at large. 

The *[Chevron](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14437597860792759765 q=chevron+v+natural+resources+defense+council hl=en as_sdt=2006)* Court actually explained this very well in the process of upholding the EPA's construction of a statutory provision:

[T]he Administrator's interpretation represents a reasonable accommodation of manifestly competing interests and is entitled to deference: the regulatory scheme is technical and complex, the agency considered the matter in a detailed and reasoned fashion, and the decision involves reconciling conflicting policies. Congress intended to accommodate both interests, but did not do so itself on the level of specificity presented by these cases. Perhaps that body consciously desired the Administrator to strike the balance at this level, thinking that those with great expertise and charged with responsibility for administering the provision would be in a better position to do so; perhaps it simply did not consider the question at this level; and perhaps Congress was unable to forge a coalition on either side of the question, and those on each side decided to take their chances with the scheme devised by the agency. For judicial purposes, it matters not which of these things occurred.

Judges are not experts in the field, and are not part of either political branch of the Government. Courts must, in some cases, reconcile competing political interests, but not on the basis of the judges' personal policy preferences. In contrast, an agency to which Congress has delegated policymaking responsibilities may, within the limits of that delegation, properly rely upon the incumbent administration's views of wise policy to inform its judgments. While agencies are not directly accountable to the people, the Chief Executive is, and it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to make such policy choices  resolving the competing interests which Congress itself either inadvertently did not resolve, or intentionally left to be resolved by the agency charged with the administration of the statute in light of everyday realities.

When a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision, fairly conceptualized, really centers on the wisdom of the agency's policy, rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by Congress, the challenge must fail. In such a case, federal judges  who have no constituency  have a duty to respect legitimate policy choices made by those who do. The responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones: "Our Constitution vests such responsibilities in the political branches."

	<TEXT> Others have covered this very well. Congress doesn't have the subject matter expertise to implement certain kinds of technical regulations. So they delegate power to administrative agencies. This is important flexibility that makes regulations more effective and quicker to adapt.

I'll add this, though. One important example of an area where Congress has retained authority to draft a granular regulatory scheme is the Internal Revenue Code--which is pretty widely recognized as a complex, tangled mess of special interest carve outs and loopholes. Congress should fix this and continue to be the primary regulator on this area (which involves fundamental questions of public policy more than technical expertise). But the same approach would be a disaster if applied to something like pollution control, internet regulations, etc. Once the political decision to regulate (and with what objective) has been made, certain questions of *how to regulate* should be left to experts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It most certainly is not nothing. Not only is there symbolism in this demotion, but the purportedly abominable Obama-era structure of the NSC is being restored (from the article):

Under the move, the national intelligence director, Dan Coats, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, are again "regular attendees" of the NSCs principals committee.

This at least partially undoes the EO implementing the Bannon-led [reorganization of the NSC that Trump signed without reading](http://theweek.com/speedreads/678250/trump-apparently-signed-stephen-bannons-order-putting-bannon-national-security-council-without-reading).

	<TEXT> Eh. More like he's been 34%'ed in the polls. McMaster couldn't even get Flynn's unqualified lackey fired from the NSC when he came in. Bannon and Kushner won that important initial power struggle. And, in Trump's joint address to Congress, he pointedly shat on McMaster's counsel not to use the counterproductive term "radical Islamic terrorism".

Maybe McMaster has gained favor within the White House's chaotic power structure since then. But I think it's also plausibleperhaps more sothat this is blowback from the ill-conceived and disastrous Nunes leaks.

	<TEXT> We all know Gorsuch is bad, but this article is making an excellent point about one specific way in which he's terribleand it lines up with Bannon's comments about deconstructing the administrative state:

As a federal judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, **Gorsuch has advocated tossing out the primary Supreme Court precedent underpinning federal administrative law. Known as "Chevron deference," after the high court's 1984 unanimous ruling in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, it holds that the courts should defer to federal agencies when it comes to the rules these departments design and implement based on congressional legislation** (which sometimes hands the crafting of the nitty-gritty policy details to the government experts). Chevron deference, for instance, allows the Environmental Protection Agency to have scientists help make rules for enforcing the Clean Air Act, and it permits those regulations to be modified in response to new technology or new threats to the environment. **But without Chevron, Congress would have to design complex regulations itself and pass new legislation each time these regulations needed to be updated or tweaked.**

Gorsuch planted his flag firmly against Chevron in August, when he authored the majority opinion in a case called Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch. In a highly unusual move, he wrote a lengthy concurrence to his own opinion, laying out his arguments for overturning Chevron and reining in the power of executive agencies. **The concurrence, which approvingly cited Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., reads like a job application for a Republican Supreme Court nominee**. It seems to have caught the attention of conservatives who aided Trump in his selection process. Gorsuch's name did not appear on the short list of potential Supreme Court nominees released by his campaign last May, but he was on the updated list Trump released in September after the Gutierrez opinion came down.

[TL:DR] Gorsuch wants to engage in radical judicial activism by overturning the main precedent that gives force to administrative law.

But there are early signs this could be changing. If it does in 2018, it will be consistent with a longer-term trend in which the party out of power benefits in midterm elections, seemingly from a stronger turnout.

Democrats have fared well in recent special elections, and they have turned out in strong numbers in the four contests where complete turnout numbers are now available: a relatively uncompetitive special election in Iowas 45th State Senate district in December, two January contests in Virginia, and Delawares 10th State Senate district race in February.

...

A few elections arent enough to prove that turnout is really shifting. But there are other signs of higher Democratic enthusiasm, like the millions who marched and protested a day after Mr. Trumps inauguration, or the abundant fund-raising for Mr. Ossoff.

Parties out of power have long tended to do very well in midterm elections. It has been less clear why  maybe because of turnout, or because voters swing across parties to check the president.

...

... The best evidence comes from Iowa, which has voter turnout data by party registration going back to 1980. It tells a fairly consistent story: Democrats usually have worse turnout in midterm elections, but the Republican edge is greatest when Democrats hold the presidency. The Democratic turnout disadvantage is smaller  or basically nonexistent  when Republicans hold the White House.

On average, Republican turnout has been just 6 percent higher than Democratic turnout in midterm elections when Republicans have held the White House, like in 1982, 1986, 1990, 2002 and 2006. Republican turnout has been 17 percent higher than Democratic turnout in midterm elections when Democrats have held the presidency  like in 1994, 1998, 2010 and 2014. The same pattern shows up in the lower-quality data available elsewhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When Trump explored a presidential run back in 1999, he wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in which he suggested he would bomb North Korea if it didn't end its nuclear weapons program.

"I would let Pyongyang know in no uncertain terms that it can either get out of the nuclear arms race or expect a rebuke similar to the one Ronald Reagan delivered to Muammar Gadhafi in 1986," he wrote, referring to the U.S. bombing of Libya under Reagan's administration.

Trump followed up those comments with a passage about North Korea in his 2000 book, "The America We Deserve." In the book, Trump called US policy towards North Korea "weak-minded," and explicitly said he would bomb the country's nuclear facilities.


"**Am I ready to bomb this reactor? You're damned right**," Trump wrote. "When the Israelis bombed the Iraqi nuclear reactor they were condemned by the world community. But they did what they had to do to survive. The Korean nuclear capability is a direct threat to the United States. **As an experienced negotiator, I can tell you that negotiation with these madmen will be fruitless** once they have the ability to lob a nuclear missile into Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York. **I don't advocate a thermonuclear war, but if negotiations fail, I advocate a surgical strike against these outlaws before they pose a real threat**."

In the book, Trump also **dismissed concerns about nuclear fallout from the strike.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think (a) Garland now in exchange for (maybe) Gorsuch later plus an intact enforceable filibuster until 2020 is a bad outcome compared to (b) Gorsuch now (after nuclear option) and 1-2 additional Trump nominees with some actuarial probability (the realistic alternative).

Similarly, I don't think (a) Gorsuch now plus an intact enforceable filibuster to use against 1-2 Trump nominees is a bad outcome compared to (b) the realistic alternative.

Of course, the filibuster is totally illusory and McConnell cannot be trusted. So I'm not suggesting Democrats take the deal.

The other terms are secondary. 

Republicans following the rules *should* be expected. But we know to instead expect McConnell to game for maximum partisan advantage. We have to acknowledge reality. If there *were* a way to hold them to the standing rules and norms, at a time Democrats are in the minority, that would have strategic value.

Finally, I agree that enacting their unpopular agenda would be more damaging to Trump and the Republican Party than standard gridlock and stalemate. But their agenda will harm a lot of people in the interim, and is thus inherently worth trying to block*even if* it's less politically advantageous to Democrats than letting the policies fail and wreak havoc to fuel a backlash.

	<TEXT>  I think that would be a good deal for the Democrats if it is accepted by the Republicans. BUT, if the Republicans turn it down, I think it backfires, because now the R's still go nuclear and confirm Gorsuch, and now they can claim that the D's opposition to Gorsuch is purely political and not due to Gorsuch's quality as a judge (which D's could plausibly argue now due to Gorsuch's history of decisions against the vulnerable and for the powerful), giving them cover on the nuclear option and ammunition against the D's in the future.

 In the end, I think the R's would turn down the deal, and the D's would be worse off having proposed it.

I don't think the broader public pays attention at this granular level of detail, and in any event, they likely already consider a large part of Democrats' opposition to Gorsuch to be political. And that [probably won't have significant consequences](https://newrepublic.com/article/141821/democrats-wont-pay-opposing-neil-gorsuch?utm_content=bufferd48b9 utm_medium=social utm_source=twitter.com utm_campaign=buffer). 

If they needed cover, Democrats could just say--pretty convincingly--that they were willing to cut a deal to de-escalate the situation, and that even if they did cut the deal, they still intended to vote against Gorsuch for final confirmation even if they did not filibuster him. And they'd have Garland and a 5-4 center-left SCOTUS majority to help keep Trump in line until someone retires or passes away.  

The biggest danger of such a deal wouldn't be from Senate Republicans labeling Democratic actions as political, but from the popularity boost Trump would get from pulling this off on his watch (and to be fair, if Trump had the political smarts to do this, he would deserve some degree of legit credit). The centrist media types would fawn over such a deal and start daydreaming about a bipartisan "entitlement reform" grand bargain. And there'd surely be stories talking about how Trump had managed to put the scandal-plagued beginning of his presidency behind him and reach out to the other side.

	<TEXT> If that deal could be trusted it wouldn't be a terrible tradeoff. But, of course, it can't be. 

At minimum, you'd need a fixed end date. It can't be Trump's term because that could well end before 2020. It also has to cover Pence and any other Republican successor. 

It would also need an enforcement mechanism or costly signal that could make it credible. The best I can think of is pulling Gorsuch and re-nominating Garland in exchange for Democrats agreeing not to filibuster Gorsuch if another vacancy opens up during Trump's term. The other terms could remain the same. 

*That* would be a worthwhile deal, and since we'd get Garland up front, it would be credible to Democrats. It would be credible to Republicans because they could nuke the filibuster down the line if Democrats did try to filibuster Gorsuch.

No chance this revised deal would happen. But it would be the way to de-escalate and escape the current hyper-polarized mess.

	<TEXT> This is huge for several reasons. 

*First*, there's extensive precedent covering the '64 Civil Rights Actand it's a powerful anti-discrimination tool. All of that precedent would potentially become applicable here. Since this is a federal law, it also preempts inconsistent state laws. There have been polls suggesting that the public not only supports anti-discrimination job protections for LGBT people, but thinks it's already the law at the federal level.

*Second*, the decision was issued *en banc**i.e.*, by the whole 7th Circuit, which has a majority of Republican appointees. This is now settled in that Circuit because you can't go any higher other than SCOTUS. Moreover, this *en banc* opinion will likely be influential even if it technically isn't law outside the 7th Circuit. If any appeals court outside the Circuit rules differently, then you have the kind of split that the SCOTUS would likely have to resolve.

*Third*, it underscores the importance of SCOTUS right before the Senate confirmation showdown this week. You can bet there are already at least 2 votes in favor of reversal: Thomas and Alito. Roberts would possibly be a third vote. So if you add Gorsuch, another *very* likely no vote, it will come down to Kennedy, who authored *Obergefell*, and can use this to further cement his legacy as a defender of LGBT rights. Affirming this case gives him a chance to put LGBT rights within a sex discrimination/intermediate scrutiny framework (to supplement the substantive-due process/fundamental rights framework of Obergefell), which could be used to extend the protections of multiple other federal statutes.

	<TEXT> **The American Health Care Act, which was dead, may now be undead, or at least that is the hope of White House officials negotiating with conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus to revive the bill**, Politico reported.

The apparent terms of the bill's revival do not make a great deal of political sense.

Matt Fuller, who covers the Freedom Caucus for The Huffington Post, reports that the head of the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Mark Meadows, said he believed that **the deal would allow states to waive the essential-health-benefits rules under Obamacare - those are the rules that say health plans have to cover certain benefits like maternity care, prescription drugs, and hospitalization - and, in a change from the previous version of the AHCA, would allow them to waive a rule called community rating.**

Community rating is the rule that says insurers have to charge customers the same price, except that they may impose limited surcharges based on your age and whether you smoke. An insurer is not allowed to charge you more just because you are sick.

The Freedom Caucus wants to give insurers much more freedom to charge different customers different prices...


People who want coverage for expensive benefits, such as substance-abuse treatment, might wait until they need the coverage to buy it. Insurers, unable to block specific customers, would have to price insurance on the assumption that any buyer is buying a specific benefit because he or she intends to use it. Ultimately, the pricing for many benefits would become so unattractive that insurers would stop selling coverage for them altogether.

Obamacare prevents this problem by making everyone buy approximately the same basket of coverage. **
Under the amorphous new deal being discussed, this problem would be addressed through insurers' new freedom to price products however they wish for different customers.**

**Insurers still couldn't tell a person with cancer that he or she can't get chemotherapy coverage, but they could tell the person that coverage would cost $10 million a year, which is kind of like saying the person can't have the coverage at all.** This pricing flexibility would keep the sickest patients out of the insurance pool and thereby make it economical to sell coverage for chemotherapy at a reasonable price to customers who do not have cancer.

You can see the political problem, right?

It's part of a broader problem on healthcare for Republicans: While they got a lot of political buy-in for the idea that Obamacare "should be repealed and replaced," there was not buy-in from the electorate for Republicans' preferred terms for the replacement, such as that cost-shifting from the sick to the healthy should be greatly reduced.

Of course, a reduction in cost-shifting might even sound good at first pass. ("Why should I pay for somebody else's healthcare?") But when the specific effects become clear - the matter of greatly jacking up insurance rates for expectant mothers and cancer patients so young, healthy men can pay less - the politics become toxic.

If and when a revised AHCA becomes available containing this provision, it will most likely hit the same political wall that the previous AHCA did: The proposal will be very unpopular, with a loud and angry constituency opposing it, and no significant political constituency eager for it, except for rich people who want the tax cut embedded within the AHCA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hehe. You got me thinking about random shit so I may bloviate for a bit.

When you hire a lawyer, especially in litigation, you're hiring someone to do the best job they can representing *your* interests (if they take it as seriously as they're legally required to), but having specialized legal knowlege at their disposal to do it. At least that's how I approach it. What would I do *myself* if I were in this person's shoes facing this problem?

This produces one-sided output by designthe theory being that the other side will also put forth their best version of what happened, and the truth will somehow emerge from the adversarial clash of the opposing positions. 

It can work well in certain situationsbut it also has side-effects, including on the lawyers. Since not every client is actually right, sometimes, you have to be able to come up with good reasons for getting to the wrong result. And you have to believe in the cause too, otherwise you can't argue it zealously and effectively. So lawyering is a profession that rewards being able to quickly develop and adopt strong defensible positions that you wouldn't necessarily hold yourself. But that takes a toll. Some part of the soul is consumed getting though law school and another part from doing this over and over. I just didn't think it was 1999/2000ths of it. 

Not yet, anyway.

**[TL:DR] Lawyers are trained to generate one-sided arguments for** ***either*** **side. So when we're representing the wrong sideor if both sides are wrongwe're basically full of shit, and others perceive it. Constant proximity to bullshit exacts a toll.**


----

But, getting back to your point

 I support all of these process reforms as well. Not because I believe it will help Democrats, but because it will benefit democracy and, ultimately, governance. I wish we were able to improve processes for the sake of it, without considering whether it would benefit our side.

Here's what I came up with a while back, before the election, when I was feeling inspired to write down a [comprehensive package of process reforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/52kzbg/comment/d7lgrsc).

Maybe I'll write a reformed model Constitution one of these days based on this package if I'm bored or the Orange One takes a breather from the buffoonery. Or perhaps it can be done together with other people who are also interestedas a Google doc, or something.               </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is no "Biden Rule." There's only deliberately self-serving, out-of-context characterizations by Republicans of what Biden said:

If they were proud of what they'd done with Garland, they'd own it.

Garland was subjected to a 310 day wait with no actionthe longest delay faced by any SCOTUS nominee since 1869, when instituted a 9-member Court. The previous record was 127 days from nomination to successful confirmation. There was ample time to consider and reject or confirm Garland.

	<TEXT> Check out the first part of the discussion link. [TL:DR] It would typically be the U.S. Attorney for DC (a subordinate of Sessions), or possibly a special prosecutor (normally would be appointed by Sessions but for his recusal from anything related to Russia). But yeah, in essence, Sessions would directly or indirectly be the boss of whomever brought the case against him. 

*Awkward*. (Read: potentially career-ending).

This is why the A.G. is an incredibly powerful position. You could argue that, if the Republic survives the Trump Regime, we might want to craete an independent arm of the DoJ to watch the watchers (with the obvious problem that you'd then need someone to watch the watchers of the watchers). Maybe it could be a civil service type deal, or maybe a panel of judges. Or just bring back the independent counsel statute.

	<TEXT> You see, I've assumed and *still* believe that the average person is good, decent, and capable of making sound collective decisions. 

Since Trump's election, there's been a lot of talk about how democracy failed us. If someone wants to appear serious, they talk about the growing distrust of experts and institutions, and lament how susceptible the masses were to Trump's crude demagogy (I remember reading pieces about how Trump's  destruction of norms was mainly dangerous because he was clearing the path for a hypothetical *future* demagogue who might actually be good at demagogy). 

What's lost in this narrative is that the wisdom of the crowd correctly recognized Trump as a dangerous and incompetent charlatan. And the crowdor "the mob," as common people are often referred torejected him. 

Trump's election wasn't a "failure of democracy." It was a failure of *not enough* democracy. Mob rule did just fine.  It was the Electoral College that fucked us. Again. Just as in 2000, the basic democratic principle of one-person-one-vote would have given us the right verdict. But instead, our minoritarian, anachronistic, anti-competitive excuse for an electoral systemwhich purportedly exists to protect us from the whims the ignorant unwashed mob, but is [actually just a bad holdover from slavery](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5j8isu/protesters_interrupt_wisconsin_electoral_vote_you/dbebea2/)valued the judgment of 77,744 people in MI, WI   PA more than that of 2,946,436 people nationwide, and, unsurprisingly, got it wrong.

Trump is President not because a lawyers' vote counts the same as that of a single mom with a high school education working two part-time jobs, or an unemployed factory worker. On the contrary, he's President becausedepending on the accident of where we each happen to liveour votes are counted separately and unequally, in 51 different containers, and thus are not permitted to balance each other outwhich is *precisely how* democracies harness the crowd's wisdom.                             </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, so there are various potential and actual  conflicts that you try to remove with something like a blind trust. 

First and most obviously, to you don't want even the appearance of Presidents making policy that knowingly benefits or avoids harming the President's own wealth or income, because that raises questions of ulterior motive. If Trump continues to benefit directly from his businesses, his descion-making can be improperly influenced. Ideally, the President should not even know what he owns so that he can't possibly favor it. Giving up management of a company to a close family member but continuing to own it and have the power to fire the family member is grossly inadequateespecially if you're briefed on your holdings and how they're doing.

Secondly, even if a President is unaware of his holdings and makes decisions independent of any effect on them, you also don't want the people managing the President's money to have material non-public information at their disposal. The managers should be in the same position as the investing public, not having any special insight into what happens next. If they do have such information, they can adjust the holdings to benefit at the expense.of others. It's akin to insider trading. 

As a concrete example, Trump has made a political issue of dolating his Presidenial salary. Originally he said he'd refuse it. By donating it, he gets a tax benefit at the government's expense. But beyond that, he can afford to donate the salary in part because he can withdraw money from his trust. And as President, he's increased the value of the property (presumably held by the trust) through actions he's taken. For example, visiting Mar-a-Lago frequently and using the access members have to him in order to raise the membership fee. And then there's the direct payments the government (e.g. the Secret Service) make to his businesses in order to simply protect him. So he's still getting paid. Just a lot more, a lot less transparently, while pulling his no salary PR stunt. 

This banana republic level graft and self-dealing. And it's happening pretty much right in the open*after* he falsely projected this same corrupt motive onto his political opponent.

	<TEXT> Suing federal agencies for the rules and regulations that they promulgate implicates substantive administrative law, as well as the statutes that authorize the rules and regulations.

By contrast, what's implicated here are internal rules and procedures of the Senate.

I agree that the Political Question Doctrine is not helpfully namedit's more of a separation of powers justiciability and abstention doctrine. I didn't help things by not capitalizing the name of the Doctrine to indicate I was referring to a proper noun rather than an abstract concept.

In [*Baker v. Carr*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6066081450900314197 q=powell+v+mccormack hl=en as_sdt=2006), 369 US 186 (1962), the Supreme Court held that a case that raises inextricable political questions are nonjusticiable, and laid out this multi-factor test:

Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found [1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or [5] an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question. (Numeration added.)

Here, on the surface at least, you'd potentially have strong issues with factors 1 and 4.

In particular, [Article I, Section 5, Clause 2 of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section5) provides that:

**Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings**, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.

Facially, this looks like a textual commitment, so I think it would possibly be an uphill battle. But I haven't looked at the case law in any detail. Maybe you have? Like I said, I'd love to be persuaded.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Query whether a court would intervene to interpret rules of the Senate. Generally, with some exceptions, each house of Congress gets to set and interpret its own rules.  Courts typically invoke the political question doctrine to abstain from such cases. With that said, courts occasionally do intervene, particularly when constitutional issues are implicated. 

Though I support filibustering Gorsuch, I doubt courts would wade into a controversy implicating the validity of Senate procedures used to move a judicial nomination to a final vote.  But they might well weigh in if the Senate purported to confirm a nomination without a majority, for example, by preventing duly elected Senators from voting. 

I'd love to be persuaded otherwise if you have some special insight here. </TEXT>

Why would they Filibuster, anyway? He was unanimously approved in 2006.


A voice vote isn't the same thing as unanimous approval. Further, as you rack up a judicial record, people can reconsider. Recall, as well, that it's not all the same Senators who are there to vote. Finally, keep in mind that Gorsuch is being considered for a different and far more important position. The stakes for SCOTUS nominations are much higher. 

Those are just the reasons why his prior approval on a voice vote don't necessarily even imply a change in position for those who don't support him now. There are plenty of [reasons to oppose Gorsuch](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6339q6/z/dfr18tn) himself.

	<TEXT> The way the nuclear option works is, someone raises a point of order, noting that the 60-vote requirement to invoke cloture is unconstitutional because it has the effect of raising the confirmation threshold from 51 to 60+. The Presiding officer agrees that it's a constiutional question and puts it to a vote by the full Senate, which then rules on the objection by a simple majoritypresumably affirming the point of order. The former rule is then gone. 

What makes it "nuclear" is that it would normally take 2/3rds vote to change Senate rules mid-session through an affirmative proposal. This move avoids that requirement because it's raised as an objection to an attempt to filibuster (*i.e.* defeat a cloture motion with 41+ votes).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The two-wrongs-don't-make-a-right framing is misleading.

This is basic tit-for-tat reciprocity: [proportional retaliation to deter future gamesmanship](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mygn5/mcconnell_not_following_confirmation_process_he/dc7sth4). And, unlike Republicans did with Garland, Democrats can't actually block Gorsuch if Republicans decide they really want him. They can only raise the political cost of confirming Gorsuch. I'm not willing to characterize that as wrong inder the circumstances, let alone equivalent to what happened to Garland.

If Democrats roll over and appease Republican gamesmanship every time, they incentivize the GOP's norm-defying behavior (and lazy punditry will still falsely equate the parties with the tired "both sides do it" framing). This leads to a ratcheting effect where Democratsand their constituenciesget taken advantage of over time. 

That's bullshit double standard that shouldn't be tolerated. It's on the GOP to respect norms as well, not just Democrats. They can choose to do so by not nuking the filibuster and picking a more moderate nominee in consultation with Democratsor by simply re-nominating Garland to de-escalate the situation. If they did the latter, and Democrats agreed to let Gorsuch through on the next round, that would be a true compromise.    

You won't see that though. Democrats are expected to make all the concessions.

	<TEXT> Lets start with how Gorsuch got to the point of being nominated in the first place. The judge secured a clerkship on the Supreme Court in 1993 after a post-law school year at Oxford University, quite an accomplishment for a new lawyer. But the clerkship began with Justice Byron White. White was known to favor his home state of Colorado, and it was unsurprising that he handed a clerkship to a bright, politically connected fourth-generation Coloradan. White had just retired, though, and a clerkship with a retired justice is not nearly as prestigious as one with sitting justices, because they do not work on Supreme Court cases. As a courtesy to Whites clerks, Gorsuch got to work in Justice Anthony M. Kennedys chambers, too  not because Kennedy hired him through a process based only on merit, but instead, because Kennedy wanted to help a fellow justice.

Then theres the question of how Gorsuch got his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. To be nominated for such a prestigious position, it helps to be politically connected. Gorsuchs mother was a Republican Colorado state legislator and later held a top position in President Ronald Reagans administration. Gorsuch was a lawyer to Philip Anschutz, one of the wealthiest people in the state and country, who advocated on his behalf. The conservative billionaire helped push Gorsuchs case for nomination to the appeals court with President George W. Bush. Gorsuch must be grateful, because even as a 10th Circuit judge, he has continued to speak at off-the-record events for Anschutz.

Would Gorsuch have been in the position he is in today if life were a pure meritocracy? Who knows, but I wouldnt count on it. There are often more qualified people than there are positions.

This is not to say that Gorsuch is unqualified. Far from it. But often, it is not just quality that matters in terms of who gets ahead.

Given Gorsuchs background, someone like him  like many of us  should count his blessings and realize that aside from his abilities, he was helped by others along the way and could be in a position to pay it forward. He will almost certainly be in that position should he be confirmed to the Supreme Court, where fights over the use of race-based affirmative action in university admissions and hiring will continue to divide the justices over the next few years. </TEXT>

What I think is that it might backfire under a future Democratic President. It could also have indirect costs such as making Democrats more willing to play hardball, such as Garlanding any nominations that come up if Dems retake the Senate during the Trump Presidency. There are other possibilities as well, like ending the legislative filibuster or  expanding the Supreme Court as part of a de-Trumpification. Who knows?

If Garland had been confirmed, in all likelihood, Democrats would go along with a more conservative choice now. Over time, alternating party control keeps some sort of balance, even if the Court has not had a liberal majority since 1969. 

Yet, if vacancies are transferred to Republican administrations ala Garland, you get an unfair ratcheting effect. So Democrats have to fight back now however they can. The Constitution is at stake.

(1) Substantively, Gorsuch is to the right of Scalia and Alito and will be part of the same radical right-wing project to expand corporate power, curtail the regulatory functions of the federal government, break organized labor, weaken consumer legal protections, and undermine women's reproductive choices. He has exceptional qualifications and an affable demeanor, but that doesn't outweigh the former. He failed to answer even basic questions about landmark cases like *Griswold v. Conneticut* and *Brown v. Board of Education*. Apparently, it was a [conscious strategy](http://thehill.com/homenews/news/325343-gorsuch-rewrites-playbook-for-confirmation-hearings) that I think is pernicious and should be quashed before it takes hold. If you want a **lifetime appointment to interpret the Constitution** and, in many cases, override democratically-enacted policy, you should be prepared to talk in concrete detail about your views of the Constitution. 

(2) Beyond the merits of Gorsuch himself, there has to be a [proportional retaliatory response](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mygn5/mcconnell_not_following_confirmation_process_he/dc7sth4) to the theft of Garland's seat.  Garland was a centrist consensus choice suggested by Republicans themselves. (Here, there was no consultation with Democrats.) And he was relatively old by the standard of recent nominations, meaning hed be on the court for less time.  It didnt matter. Republicans refused to consider him for 310 days, which is almost three times as long as the previous longest time between nomination and final action since we instituted a 9-justice SCOTUS in 1869 (127 days for Justice Harlan). 

If you consider SCOTUS nominations after 1869, the average is 34.80 days and the median is 19 days from nomination to final action.

If you look at just look at nominations after 1900, you get 37.67 on average, with a median of 23 days.

If you start with Eisenhower, you get 60.82 days on average, with 65 days median.

Since Reagan, it's been 65.93 average, 71 median.

Excluding Harriet Miers, who was withdrawn largely due to Republican pressure on President Bush, here are the nominations sorted by the number of days waiting before final action during that last period:


----

1. Sandra Day O'Connor	33

2. Ruth Bader Ginsburg	50

3. John Roberts, Jr. (C.J.)	62

4. Anthony Kennedy	65

5. Sonia Sotomayor	66

6. David Souter	69

7. Stephen Breyer	73

8. Samuel Alito, Jr.	82

9. Antonin Scalia	85

10. Elena Kagan	87

11. William Rehnquist (C.J.)	89

12. Clarence Thomas	99

13.  (*Not confirmed*) Robert Bork	108

14. (***NOT EVEN CONSIDERED***) **Merrick Garland	310**

----

Bork is instructive. Republicans bitch about him incessantly. But Bork was denied confirmation by a bipartisan 58-42 vote. 

[6 Republican Senators voted against him](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/senate-s-roll-call-on-the-bork-vote.html) --

John Chafee (R-RI)

Bob Packwood (R-OR)

Arlen Specter (R-PA)

Robert Stafford (R-VT)

John Warner (R-VA)

Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-CT)

This isn't the same as filibustering Bork, let alone *refusing to even consider* his nomination for 10 monthswhich is what actually occurred with Garland. *And remember*: Bork was the guy who fired Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor, in Nixons Saturday Night Massacre. That alone warranted rejecting him.

So this isn't petty squabbling. It's strategic deterrence. If Democrats ignore each Republican defection from the standing norms and continue to be nice as they're trampled on, they reward and encourage further gamesmanship. So you get a ratcheting effect where Republicans take more and more advantage and are never held to account. By retaliating and creating the expectation that every action has consequences, Republicans may think twice in the future.

	<TEXT> I think OP may have been referring to [*general* strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike), in which a large segment of the population stops working, regardless of industry. Usually those are tied to broad political demands, not specific employers. General strikes are pretty rare in the U.S., but there were some in the 1800s in various cities, like Philadelphia, New Orleans, and St. Louis. There was also a general strike in Seattle in 1919 and San Francisco in 1934. I don't know of many recent American examples. 

Sustained mass protests and general strikes can topple governments and force action from political institutions that otherwise seem stuck. If you mobilized 3-5% of the U.S. population against Trump, and they stayed in the streets day after day, the country would basically become ungovernable until he resigned--and it likely wouldn't even take that long. The Tahrir Square protests that led to Mubarak's ouster lasted just 18 days. He'd been in power for 3 decades. Here's [news coverage in chronological order showing the evolution of the protests](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFCAAF4E47A0B5795).


[More Tahrir Square footage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwix_CMMLWA) (huge crowds... and [loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASnaFc3oRQY).)

I think three weekends of protests is a step in the right direction--assuming each of these marches are well-organized and large. People should go into it with a plan for how to continue organizing and building further protests on the foundation laid by these. One-off protests can be ignored. For example, a key next step for activists would be getting large protests during the week building into their weekend marches. 

I think that to get the kind of numbers required to force dramatic political action, we'll need something like an airtight revelation of direct collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the Congress nevertheless refusing to do anything about it. That could be spark.

	<TEXT> If you're voting to keep debating (*i.e.*, against cloture), it's a filibuster, not an up or down vote. And I'm fine with that. Democrats shouldn't be ashamed of it. They should force Republicans to try to invoke cloture. And if Republicans can't get the 60 votes necessary to do that, they have the choice of going nuclear or finding another nominee. I'd like to see whether they actually have the votes for that. They need 50 votes plus Pence. If they kill the filibuster for SCOTUS nominations, they're going to have to live with the consequences of it too down the line.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speaking Sunday on CNNs State of the Union, Schiff said Nunes and the White Houses actions proved that they were trying to distract from the broader question of what role, if any, Russia had played in the U.S. election.

It certainly is an attempt to distract and to hide the origin of the materials, to hide the White House hand, Schiff said. The question is, of course, why? And I think the answer to the question is this effort to point the Congress in other directions, basically say, Don't look at me, don't look at Russia, there is nothing to see here. You know, I would tell people, whenever they see the president use the word fake, it ought to set off alarm bells. And I think that is really what has gone on here.

Schiff, who last week went to the White House to view the same intelligence files Nunes had originally seen, also disputed the administrations claim, including from press secretary Sean Spicer, that the files were produced in the ordinary course of business.

Well, the question for the White House and for Mr. Spicer is the ordinary course of whose business? Because, if these were produced either for or by the White House, then why all of the subterfuge? There's nothing ordinary about the process that was used here at all.

...

Asked about Nunes's original claim, that some Trump campaign officials were improperly unmasked in intelligence documents, Schiff declined to comment. At this point, I can't say whether anything was masked or unmasked improperly, he said.

And he also said he was not prepared to answer one of the central questions his committee is investigating: whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russians to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign.

I don't think we can say anything definitively at this point, Schiff said. We are still at the very early stage of the investigation. The only thing I can say is that it would be irresponsible for us not to get to the bottom of this.

From the article:

At the rally, **Trump repeatedly said get 'em out of here before, according to the protesters, they were shoved and punched by his supporters**. Trump's attorneys sought to have the case dismissed on free speech grounds, arguing that he didn't intend for his supporters to use force. But Hale noted that speech inciting violence is not protected by the First Amendment and ruled that there is plenty of evidence that the protesters' injuries were a direct and proximate result of Trump's words.

**It is plausible that Trumps direction to get 'em out of here advocated the use of force, Hale wrote. It was an order, an instruction, a command.**

--

The judge was ruling on a motion to dismiss.  At this stage of a case, courts will assume the facts alleged by a plaintiff's complaint are true and draw inferences favorable to the plaintiff from those facts. If the plaintiff cannot establish that the defendant is liable even on this one-sided version of what might have happened, then the case is thrown out. 

But if the plaintiff's allegations can support liability, then the case is allowed to move forward to discovery.

All the judge is saying here is that he can't say, as a matter of law, that what Trump said was not inciting violence. Whether it was or not still has to be established with evidence.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is probably one of the most important things to come out of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday.

[Trump shamelessly mischaracterized, exaggerated, and exploited the leaked information](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-wikileaks-emails-a-window-inside-clinton-corruption) (link to Trump's own statements on his campaign site). 

David Frum's has been saying this for a while, including in this excellent piece from December:

[How Trump Made Russia's Hacking More Effective](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-trump-made-russias-hacking-more-effective/511880/)

**The content of the Russian-hacked emails was actually remarkably unexplosive.** Probably the biggest news was that Hillary Clinton had expressed herself in favor of a hemispheric common market in speeches to Wall Street executives. Otherwise, we learned from them that some people at the Democratic National Committee favored a lifelong Democrat for their partys nomination over a socialist interloper who had joined the party for his own convenience. We learned that many Democrats, including Chelsea Clinton, disapproved of the ethical shortcomings of some of the people in Bill Clintons inner circle. We learned that Hillary Clinton acknowledged differences between her public and private positions on some issues. **None of this even remotely corroborated Donald Trumps wild characterizations of the Russian-hacked, Wikileaks-published material.**

[*Trump statement*] These Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty. This criminal government cartel doesnt recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations.

Or:

[*Trump statement*] The more emails WikiLeaks releases, the more lines between the Clinton Foundation, the secretary of state's office and the Clintons' personal financesthey all get blurred  I mean, at what pointat what point do we say it? Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency.

**Without Trumps own willingness to make false claims and misuse Russian-provided information, the Wikileaks material would have deflated of its own boringness. The Russian-hacked material did damage because, and only because, Russia found a willing accomplice in the person of Donald J. Trump.**

Many questions remain about how the Russian spy services did what they did. That includes Putins motives for ordering the operation. But on issues from Crimea to Syria to NATO to the breakup of the European Union, Trumps publicly expressed views align with Putins wishes.

**Over Trumps motives for collaborating so full-throatedly with Russian espionage, there hangs a greater and more disturbing mysterya mystery that Trump seems in no hurry to dispel.** And maybe he is wise to leave the mystery in place: as delegitimizing as it is, its very possible the truth would be even worse.    

I agree, and am glad to see this issue finally getting some traction. 

Yes, direct collusion would be worseand may have occured. But even without it, Trump shouldn't be given a free pass for his conscious exploitation of the Russian *dezinformatsiya* and influence campaign. **That much we already know occured.**

 Trump was briefed privately by the Intel Community on Russia being behind the hacks during the campaign, but in public continued with the absurd insistence that it could be some 400 lb basement dweller in New Jersey. He seized on the information itself and didn't hesitate to exaggerate and weaponize, even though by doing this he was acting as a megaphone for Russian propaganda.

	<TEXT> I'm all for staunch opposition [and proportional retaliation](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mygn5/mcconnell_not_following_confirmation_process_he/dc7sth4). But I don't think Democrats should be as nihilistic and cynical as Republicans. Unlike Trump, McConnell, and Ryan, et al., Democrats actually care about the people who will suffer under the Trump Regime's policies. We should cut deals to make people's lives better nowprovided they're good deals.

 Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate. It's *their* responsibility to govern. They can't even agree among themselves, though. That's why they're coming to Democrats to begin with. They need Democrats to fill the hole left by the recalcitrant Freedom Caucus. 

This gives Democrats leverage if they can stick together. If they counter-propose policies acceptable to their entire caucus, and then say: here's something ~190 of us can get behind. We're willing to negotiate to get us 30 R votes. But they shouldn't allow Republicans to pull the same move by picking off a few Dems with token concessions or pork. No symbolic bipartisanship. Dems have the credible threat of falling back on "no" because they're not the governing party. Republicans bear the responsibility if nothing gets done. Yet if Republicans offer genuine concessions and the end result is good policy that Dems can believe in, then of course Dems should deal.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've previously explained some of the [possible scenarios in greater depth](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/61vc6s/z/dfhmnio). 

Here, I'll just outline what I think is the simplest way to have a new Presidential election *before 2020*.

Foremost, it's important to understand that, **after the VP, the line of succession isn't actually defined by the Constitution.**

Rather, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 gives Congress the power, through an ordinary federal law, to decide who becomes acting President when the Presidency and Vice-Presidency are vacant. Congress did that with the Presidential Succession Act (PSA). That's where the familiar Speaker of the House, President Pro Temp of the Senate, Secretary of State, etc., progression comes from. The Constitution doesn't require that particular order, and it has language at Art II, Sec. 1, Cl. 4 authorizing Congress to schedule Presidential elections.

So, rather than the acting President serving for the remainder of the current President's term, the PSA could just mandate a special election on a short schedulelet's say, 90 daysto fill the vacancy. The acting caretaker President would serve only until the special election. The new President chosen in that election could serve until the next regularly scheduled Presidential election. 

Alternatively, if there were constitutional issues wirh shortening the Presidential term from 4 years to the remainder of the current term, then the PSA could just move up the next regular Presidential election to what would have been the next midterm election. Then, the next regular Presidential election after that would be in 2022, then 2026, and so on.  

Once the PSA is amended in either of the ways described above, one could create a dual vacancy by (a) impeaching Pence and Trump in that order; or by (b) judicially annuling the election and vacating both offices. Either would trigger the amended PSA.

Done.

	<TEXT> More than just standard. Since the Civil War, there have been 39 midterm elections, starting with 1862. The President's party has lost seats (or a % of the legislature, when the House was growing) in 36 of them. On average, the loss is over 30 seats. This is one of the strongest patterns in American politics.

The three exceptions are 1934, 1998, and 2002, when the President's party gained 9, 5 and 8 seats respectively. 

In 1934, people were extremely pissed at the Republicans for the Great Depression, whereas Roosevelt was very popular and campaigned against their obstruction of the New Deal. Democrats gained 9 Seats in the Senate as well. This was the most successful midterm in American history.

In 1998, the economy was roaring and Republicans had impeached a very popular President Clinton (65% approval) over his blowjob. 

And in 2002, in the aftermath of 9/11 and during the buildup to the Iraq War, Bush was still at 67% approval.  


The last example is relevant because the Canteloupe Crackpot might try to exploit a terrorist attack to fearmonger and hold on. But the fundamentals say that Republicans may well lose control, despite partisan gerrymanderingespecially if he and Ryan (currently 21 approve / 61 disapprove / net -40) continue to be highly unpopular.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CBS's Major Garrett.... pressed Spicer on that question, given the White House often complains about Trump's tweets being misinterpreted and not allowed to speak for themselves.

And technically, Trump didn't say Flynn should get immunity  only that he should ask for it. So good on Garrett for asking for specificity.

He got none, however. Instead, Spicer merely said the White House wanted to do what it takes to allow Flynn to testify.

Here's the exchange, in pieces:

    GARRETT: When the president says Mike Flynn should get immunity, is he suggesting to Congress that it grant immunity?

    SPICER: I think Mike Flynn and his legal counsel should do what's appropriate for Mike Flynn.

Deflection No. 1.

    GARRETT: Right, but they cannot obtain immunity; it must be granted. is the president recommending  either to the FBI or to Congress  that it grant immunity? Because that's the only way it can happen.

    SPICER: I understand that. But again, he didn't say, 'Congress should grant.'

So he doesn't think it should be granted?


    GARRETT: That's why I'm asking. What does he mean by that?

    SPICER: What he means is he supports Mike Flynn's attempts to go up to Congress and to be very clear with everything with they ask and everything that they want.

Deflection No. 2/3.

GARRETT: Right. But he could have just said, 'Testify.' He said he should get immunity.  For the president to even lightly indicate that he is in favor of that, it seems to me, is a significant development. And I'm trying to find out if that's what the president was trying to accomplish.

SPICER: And I'm trying to answer the question, which is that I think what the  not that I think, I've talked to the president  and the president's very clear that he wants Mike Flynn to go and be completely open and transparent with the committee. And whatever it takes to do that, he's supportive of.

That didn't answer the question, really.

You could be forgiven for thinking the White House was walking back Trump's tweet and suddenly decided that giving Flynn immunity was a pretty bad idea.

...[A]pparently the tweet was mean to be taken seriously, not literally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since the Civil War, there have been 39 midterm elections, starting with 1862. The President's party has lost seats (or a % of the legislature, when the House was growing) in 36 of them. On average, the loss is over 30 seats. This is one of the strongest patterns in American politics.

The three exceptions are 1934, 1998, and 2002, when the President's party gained 9, 5 and 8 seats respectively. 

In 1934, people were extremely pissed at the Republicans for the Great Depression, whereas Roosevelt was very popular and campaigned against their obstruction of the New Deal. Democrats gained 9 Seats in the Senate as well. This was the most successful midterm in American history.

In 1998, the economy was roaring and Republicans had impeached a very popular President Clinton (65% approval) over his blowjob. 

And in 2002, in the aftermath of 9/11 and during the buildup to the Iraq War, Bush was still at 67% approval.  


The last example is relevant because the Canteloupe Crackpot might try to exploit a terrorist attack to fearmonger and hold on. But the fundamentals say that Republicans may well lose control, despite partisan gerrymanderingespecially if he is at 35% or lower approval and Ryan is this unpopular. 


Democrats need only 24 seats to take control. 23 if they pick up GA-06 in the special election coming up.

	<TEXT> Even with Trump's higher approval rating, he's more polarizing and provokes more intense resistanceespecially since he holds a more important office.

	<TEXT> This is quite an accomplishment:

Ryan's approval rating sunk to 21% overall, while 61% disapproved of his performance as speaker. The data prompted PPP to call Ryan "the most unpopular politician in the country."

At the start of Trump's presidency, less than three months ago, Ryan's approval-to-disapproval split stood at 33-43.

Even with Trump voters, Ryan has seen his image crumble. That group supported Ryan with a 52% approval rating and 23% disapproval when Trump took office. It has since cratered to 35% approval and 41% disapproval.   

**30 point decrease in net approva**l. Bodes well for the continuation of the Republican House majority.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also in response to /u/ailboles.

The gist is that immunity is an enforceable bargain between the prosecutor and person given immunity in exchange for their testimomy. It can be total or a more limited scope (*i.e.*, covering a limited set of issues, or time frame). The person must cooperate fully and in good faith. You can't get immunity and renege on your end of the bargain. If you do, your immunity can be stripped. Also, since immunity eliminates the risk of liability, it to that extent waives the person's 5th Amendment right to not incriminate themselves. So no taking the Fifth.

You remain subject to potential perjury charges on the testimony offered. So if you fail to tell the whole truth, you still have exposure. 

Does that help?    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 
The Constitution is both clear and precise regarding how the president is to be determined, and **provides only one remedy for changing the outcome of an election that has been settled: impeachment.**

Show me where the Constitution explicitly references election outcomes in connection with impeachment. There's no *shall only* provision.

Impeachment is defined by [Article II, Section 4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section4):

The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.

This expressly provides a method of removing federal officers. It doesn't say that you can't judicially attack the validity of the election through which they were chosen if fraud or some other misconduct subsequently calls its legitimacy into question.

Article III, Section 2 merely says that:

The trial of all crimes, **except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury**; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.

This differentiates between impeachment and criminal trials. 


In turn, Article I, Section 2, Clause 5, and Section 3, Clause 6   7, respectively, provide the mechanism for trying impeachment:

The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers; and shall have the sole power of impeachment.

and 

The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.

Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States: but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.


There's no question that impeachment can be used by Congress to remove federal officers. But there's no inherent prohibition on a court deciding a case or controversy arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States over which it has equity jurisdiction that has the effect of invalidating an election.  

From the linked post:

[Article III, Section 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section2) specifies, in the relevant part that:

The **judicial power shall extend to** ***all cases***, **in law and** ***equity***, arising under this Constitution [or] the laws of the United States...

[Federalist 83 (Hamilton)](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa83.htm) sheds further light on this broad and somewhat vague grant of jurisdiction:

"The **great and primary use of** a court of **equity is to give relief in extraordinary cases, which are exceptions to general rules.**"

Here, fully resolving the specific controversyan election tainted by foreign interferenceand fashioning an equitable remedy might well require complete annulment of the original election.

I'm not saying there aren't arguments againstonly that the judicial power is broad and flexible enough to accomplish this. The Constitution isn't a suicide pact.   </TEXT>
