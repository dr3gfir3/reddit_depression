	<TEXT> Oh, so many...

An international student went to the casino and blew his entire year's tuition and accommodation fees. He then hid in his dorm room until someone eventually found him 2 weeks later and called his parents. They sent him plane tickets home.

One student plagiarised an assignment, but stapled a photocopy of the original (with another name) to the back.

Students who cut and paste assignment text from wikipedia, but are too lazy to change the font or the referencing style...

	<TEXT> In addition to mass, there is also the height of the car. Drag (wind resistance) increases significantly with height. 
So in your example, a forrester is at an extra disadvantage because of the extra height over your celica. Not to mention it probably has a slightly larger engine so wastes more fuel at idle (traffic lights, etc).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a lot of bad teachers so it is hard to pick the worst.

It could be a teacher I had for chemistry and maths. In chemistry class she would get us to read the text book in silence for most of the lesson so she could work on assignments for her M.Ed. degree. 

In advanced maths she was beyond her level of ability. she would get stuck in the middle of problems and go and spend 5-10 mins trying to work out the solution. Once the head of the maths department walked in at one of those times and a student said "Sir, can you solve the equation, Miss can's do it". She went right off at him.
The sad part was as soon as she got her masters she got a job at a fancy private school. I pity them.

In primary school I had a teacher force me to do a test with a broken thumb and not let me see the school nurse.

I had another teacher - a very strange and perverse individual - who told my friend "didn't your mother ever tell you you don't get anything you ask for". He replied "No. She told me I don't get anything unless I ask for it".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most rules are relatively consistent between states these days.

Is your vehicle factory or retrofit? AFAIK QLD still applies the 3m rule, so it may be legal but you could be fined if you are further than 3m from the vehicle.

e.g. from QLD Transport
Thank you for your enquiry regarding turbo timers. Turbo timers are classed as an accessory and not a modification so no approval is necessary. Queensland Transport has no objection to the
fitment of turbo timers to vehicles, as long as before leaving the vehicle more than 3m the driver must, switch off the engine by turning the ignition to the off position, remove the key and lock the vehicle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am surprised remote start is legal in the litigious USA... It is not legal in many countries (e.g. Australia). 

s.213 Road Rules NSW 2008

(3) If the driver will be over 3 metres from the closest part of the vehicle, the driver must switch off the engine before leaving the vehicle.

Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In approximate numbers you will be paying $21k p.a. just in interest on your student loan.
If you pay that down $100k that will reduce to $12k p.a.

Conversely, you could conservatively make around $12k p.a. by investing in shares, which would put you about $3k p.a. in front over the first option. 

However the share market can be volatile, so there is more risk with that option. 

There are also probably income tax liabilities for either option. So if you need to pay tax on the investment income it could cancel out the benefit.  </TEXT>
