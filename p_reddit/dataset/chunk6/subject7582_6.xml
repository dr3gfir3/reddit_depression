How many times are we going to have to take this fight to Congress?  
A few years ago Reddit was all in an uproar over scanners at airports. Guess what? Nothing changed. They won, and we shut the fuck up about it. This isn't left vs right. It's not christian vs muslim. It's not white vs black.  
This is rich vs poor.  
  
And just like we've done since the fucking dawn of man, we're going to lose again. Our online privacy is doomed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a better chance of Ryan bringing us back to the center than Trump or Pence.  
Name one better option that is realistic.  
Or keep on with the downvotes and sarcasm. This is why no one takes the left seriously. We're all talk, but we don't know how to really play the game. And yeah, it is a fucking game. A very serious and very real game. This is why they call us snowflakes. The left aren't just pussies (see the last 60 years of lost elections on most all levels), we're stupid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trust me, I believe what you're saying. Fuck, I have a "Not me, US" print from the original artist framed in my bedroom.
I want what Bernie supports to happen. I donated to his campaign from June 2015-June 2016 for a reason, and followed him and Warren for 5 years before that. Warren would have been my preferred candidate because of Bernie's flaws, but what they both support for the most part is comparable. We are primed for universal healthcare if we can just make a few modest cuts to our military. We'd still kick Putin's ass in any non-nuclear war if it came to that (which it wouldn't, Russia is still just a fancy car with no engine under the hood, just like they were in the 80s. North Korea too.)
But right now, right this instant and until 2020, we have to be pragmatic. Do I think the Dems can sweep both houses in 2020 and win the Presidency with a solid pick like Warren, Sanders, Harris, Biden, or Schiff? Hell no. Not at this point. Not with Trump having a 36% approval rating. Ryan would be Gerald Ford at best. But right now, he's the best option. And he could keep some peace. We'll fight with him, but not like we have to with Trump. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Possible, and that would hurt him with a certain percentage of Republican voters who still favor Trump. But that percentage isn't as  large as it would have been on Nov. 8 when the biggest scandal was Hillary's e-mails (thanks to Comey a few days prior to the election).  
And keep in mind, the majority of the country, even after that, still favored Hillary.  
Ryan could be seen as a unifier if he plays his cards right. If he takes on radical right wing extremism from people like Putin/Trump he could bring many moderates on the left to his side. The Dems don't really have a leader right now, or a plan. Hell, that's why Hillary (a terribly flawed candidate) lost. And no, Bernie wasn't much better. he was equally flawed for being too far left.  
Ryan could bring this country back to the center, to a place of pragmatism, and in the end, peace.  
That's what we need right now, even if it's just for a few short years.  
  
And yeah, I get that Ryan is flawed. He's been bought and paid for many times over, but right now he's the best option. Pence is part of the Trump campaign. He is compromised as they all are. This whole thing is unprecedented, not just in U.S. history, but in the history of any democracy. We're living in a chapter of U.S. history right now. Let's get this impeachment done and keep that chapter as brief as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's never lied under oath before. There is a huge difference.  
Previous politicians have fibbed or lied, but never has anyone continued to lie after they were caught in it. Even Nixon admitted to wrongdoing and resigned. Of course, he was pardoned, but what he did was just the tip of the iceburg for what Trump has done.  
  
DNC's Watergate hotel room breakin by RNC  Working with foreign power (Russia) to break into DNC files
  
But yeah, the RNC really needs to stop trying to steal info from the DNC, or get much smarter about it. Trump was on national television encouraging Russia to hack the DNC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lying under oath is a huge deal to both sides of the isle. That's what got Clinton impeached. It wasn't the blowjob. It was lying about it under oath.  
Same with Nixon. It wasn't the Watergate break-in that got him. It was lying and the cover-up.  
You lie, you're in trouble. You lie under oath, you get impeached. No chance Trump is re-elected if he's impeached, even if they don't vote to remove him from office. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sessions discussed the sanctions with Russia in Dec 2016 before Trump took office (big no no). Putin didn't retaliate after their conversation.  

It's pretty obvious that Putin didn't retaliate (verbally or with his own sanctions against us) because he thought (or was told by Sessions - we'll see in the testimonies) that Trump would be friendly to Russia and lift the sanctions.  
There's way more smoke here than there ever was with Benghazi or Obama not being born in the US, and your side had absolutely no problem going after Hillary and Obama for those.

	<TEXT> To equate the two right now would be unfair. The GOP is in bed with Russia via Trump/Manafort/Sessions/Flynn/Kushner/Page/Conway's husband/etc, not the DNC. The DNC gets accused of shady shit just like the GOP used to, but this is a different level. The GOP is the villain here, not the 2-party system. We can go back to debating traditional GOP/DNC probems after this President is impeached and normalcy is restored. It's a total false equivelancy to say they "both bad" at this point though. </TEXT>
