	<TEXT> Gendry walked up the staircase to the round arena, knowing the armor that was given to him by the battlemaster was too loose. He didn't know much about armor, he spent long hot days working in the field harvesting what meager crops had grown this spring, but he could tell the fit wasn't right. Sweat beads on his nervous brow as he enters.

"What have I gotten myself into" he thinks, remembering his friends signing him up for the King's Edge, an annual sword tournament held in the town square. 
"Just let him knock me out and be done with it." he thought.
It was a long night of drinking and he'd lost a bet, his head still swam in the hangover from this morning. 

Announcements begin and the kings favored champion Peter stomps into the ring, looking two stories taller than Gendry. 

"How do they even setup these matches" he thinks, knowing in the back of his mind that this is just a warmup for the champion.

A bell rings and Peter feints forward, causing Gendry to trip backwards, barely catching himself from a full tumble. Peter waves his sword feebly in defense. Stepping in quickly Peter knocks the sword aside and kicks at Gendry's right knee.

Caught in a spin Gendry focuses on holding his sword as he comes to a sudden stop, his eyes staring straight into the champions. Confused he looks down and finds his sword stuck in the ribs of Peter, the amount of blood coming from the wound causes him to faint.

The crowd falls silent as the champion falls to his knees. </TEXT>
