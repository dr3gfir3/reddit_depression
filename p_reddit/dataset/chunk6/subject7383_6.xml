	<TEXT> I wouldn't say so. I thought the ammo/supply scarcity helped the situation; the atmosphere relies a lot on the sense of desperation and bleakness, which was brought out just a bit more by playing on hard and being continually low on supplies/counting bullets.  

It was like reading The Road with a controller in my hands. There can be slow moments (in terms of gameplay, as story was a priority) and a few animations can become repetitive, but it isn't really meant to be an action game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except the housework is a 24/7 job; all that time spent making memories of cleaning your rooms and getting them all prim and proper could have been spent outside making different memories.  

Hell, there are tons of people who do decide to renovate their rooms, then don't feel like keeping them up any more, so they don't.  
Children, unlike rooms, can't be fixed back up with a few weekends and some elbow grease.

	<TEXT> That's the accepted standard for "pure" water in chemistry; it's typically measured in the purification machine so it'd be specific to what the dimensions are within the machine.  
It's not my area, but if you're curious the one I've used most often is [Mill-Q] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli-Q), you may be able to dig up diagrams of the innards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to clarify, this is right.  
Pure water has a really high resistance (18.2 M), but basically every bit of water you come across will have salts dissolved in it; the dissociated ions carry the charge and allow current to pass through.

	<TEXT> [Actually there are a handful of total synthesis methods,] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel_total_synthesis) however, they aren't commercially viable, hence still sourcing from trees and the biosynthesis research.

You seem knowledgeable about this, could you explain how producing and selling it from poaching is possible? I figure with a drug like this there'd be a lot of regulation and fact-checking on where things were sourced from, especially with harvest regulations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Theoretical/computational chemistry is growing more every day. If you have an interest in PChem you may want to look into that. I'm not sure about jobs since I plan to go into academia, but I'd imagine having a solid grasp on physics would make you pretty marketable.

Quantum chem and inorganic turned me from a synthetic organic chemist to starting a PhD in PChem this fall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The modders themselves have discussed this and posted about it ad infinitum.

It's seen as a corporatization and is imposing a shift in the community mindset that would lead to a less welcoming/friendly environment for sharing and helping out new modders.  
They did/do have the option to get paid, they could ask for donations (but some people explicitly states they wouldn't accept donations).

The general community mindset is to do it and share, not monetize. Think GPL/GNU/CreativeCommons vs. copyright. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a 4th year undergrad chemist. I'm on the bus so I can't look into your specific example, but I can comment on what generally may be happening given what you provided.

Their "cold" fructose is stuck in a particular conformation as there isn't enough thermal energy to overcome the barrier of rotation for a particular/series of bonds in the compound. While cold, it's locked in one conformation which can only interact with one or a set of taste receptors.  
When it heats up enough, it can overcome the barrier of rotation and new conformation become accessible; it spends a portion of its time in a conformation that's able to interact with different taste receptors. </TEXT>

If you have a USB 2.0 external hard drive you could probably still crack the case open and run a SATA cable outside your case. You'd *probably* also be able to still power it via the AC adapter. </TEXT>
