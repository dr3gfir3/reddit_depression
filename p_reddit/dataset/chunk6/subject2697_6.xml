	<TEXT> It's really pilot or crew, including flight attendants. I think his case against the airline is weak based on the CoC and that there's a much better case based on other facts. But while he could prevail in a lawsuit claiming he was improperly removed and the pilot was wrong, he still has to leave. His recourse isn't going to happen on that plane and he could be slapped with charges if he insists on staying.  

Like if you're going the speed limit and there's nothing wrong with your car you still have to pull over if a cop flashes his lights at you. Cop could be wrong and you can prove it in court, but on the highway is not where you get fight the decision to be pulled over.  </TEXT>

It's a matter of federal aviation law that gives the pilot to remove any disruptive passengers. Disobeying the pilot and refusing to leave can carry a criminal penalty.

Donham admitted that she "fabricated the interaction with Till while under oath during the trial of Till's murderers," wrote Thompson in the letter. This "false statement holds liability for the death of Emmett Louise Till" and "affords the DOJ [Department of Justice] the opportunity to bring some justice to an innocent 14-year old boy," Thompson wrote.

	<TEXT> As a matter of federal law, the pilot's word about who can be and who cannot be on the plane is final. The moment you are told to leave, you have no choice but to leave that plane.

https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.3

Now, you can believe this is unfair and you can sue the airline for improper removal. But the moment you are told to leave, you can't stay there. Your boarding privilege has been revoked. You may still have a valid contract with the airline and this removal may be a breach of said contract, but you cannot force the airline to not breach your contract by staying on the plane. This is a post-9/11 safety rule and the FAA does not fuck around with pilot authority. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But that would be neurological. At least if it's cone-related, then applying a filter would help you contrast different colors better so you'd perceive the difference more readily. If you can already see red but your brain is translating it to something else, a filter won't make you see red because the problem isn't with the input, it's with the wiring. You'd have to solve the underlying neurological issue. Unless you perceive all colors as flipped, in which case, you wouldn't be seeing the same thing as everyone else, but functionally it would be the same, absent a few analogies. You'd probably not even know anything was wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's three ways. You're genetically colorblind, you suffered and eye injury (physical, drug side effect, disease, etc.), or it's psychological. With the third, glasses may give you a placebo effect. With the second, you'd have to fix the underlying problem, but if the cones are gone they're gone. You might be able to regain a small amount of color vision with Enchroma, but it wouldn't be anywhere near what you had before. With the first, you are physically incapable of perceiving certain colors. No amount of filtration will fix the fact that you can't see blue or green or whatever your particular color blindness is. 

Interestingly, the less severe the color blindness, the more likely these are to work to enable you to see colors as the less severe, the more colors you can already see. So I can see this maybe helping someone see colors if they have a moderate case of color blindness. It won't do much for severe cases. Even Enchroma says their glasses only work for red-green color blindness. http://enchroma.com/contact-us/ </TEXT>

It *may* enable you to see more green of more red if your color blindness is not as severe and you can perceive those colors in which case, yes, it'll probably help more.

	<TEXT> Sort of. The problem is, with color blindness, even if it allows you an artificially enhanced visual color range, you're still not seeing purple. So with those glasses, if someone says point to the purple one, you'd still have trouble knowing which one that is. It would be nice to see there's a difference where you couldn't before, but I can easily see how this would turn frustrating for the color blind person as they are now expected to know what color something is when asked. Keep in mind most color blind people don't talk about it because they then have to answer the inevitable "what color is [x object]." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right but I'm saying everyone thinks these make colorblind people see colors they couldn't before. That's not possible using just a filter. They likely can, as you said, differentiate colors better due to the way the light is filtered, but it'd look closer to extremes of the same color as opposed to two different colors. 

Cool, but not the same as what this video implies. Like that one where the guy is staring at his kids' eyes like he's never been able to see what color they are. If he's been seeing brown and they're green, he's not going to suddenly start seeing green. Because the other half is his brain has become used to processing that visual input as brown. So it'd just be a "greener" brown. 

I think we agree but if this is marketing, it's a shitty thing to play on emotions like that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure but you can't magically start seeing colors that you couldn't before without surgery and significant brain training. You'd probably be able to distinguish between the two a lot better, but the actual recognition of the new hue wouldn't occur simply because you applied a filter.  

If your friend got these glasses, he wouldn't now be able to see purple because his eyes lack the cones to see that color. His brain has been processing purple as brown his whole life. So he'd see maybe a different shade, maybe even one with more blue in it, but he wouldn't see the same purple you see.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, I'm actually starting to think these are faked. If he couldn't see color before, he wouldn't suddenly be able to start with glasses. The problem is inherent to his eyes because he doesn't have the right/enough cones. He can't suddenly see green or something. The glasses may enable him to differentiate green and red, for example, but he can't suddenly "see green." Also, given his age, his brain wouldn't be able to process the actual color anyway, it would recognize it as it always did. It would require a long time for him to "learn" the color he couldn't see before. The glasses don't give him cones or rewire his brain. 

And if it's a better distinction between colors his mind conflates, as I imagine it is, he probably wouldn't be super emotional about it. It'd be nifty, but it's like crying because you saw a movie in 3D because of the 3D. I'm guessing most of these videos are marketing by Enchroma.  

Edit: Alright, the earliest video for this I can find is on YouTube in December 2016, after which it was uploaded to Newsflare, which is what MSN uses to license and monetize videos. 

https://www.newsflare.com/video/109550/other/man-76-sees-colour-for-the-first-time-with-enchroma-glasses

https://www.newsflare.com/profile/OddStopWorkshop

The user that uploaded it only has two copies of the video, both posted in February at the same time. This video is also on YouTube, as I mentioned, two months before it was on Newsflare: https://youtu.be/XSD7-TgUmUY

If you expand the description, it says to contact ViralHog for licensing. ViralHog is a viral marketing firm. This video was also uploaded to The Chive, probably for similar marketing purposes. 

I'm not saying it wouldn't be wonderful to start seeing colors you couldn't before. I'm saying these glasses won't make you distinguish the red and green as those hues in the Angry Birds movie. I could be wrong, and if I am, sorry to the man for doubting his reaction, but I'm pretty sure this is an ad.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a. Board is an English word, if they have any other industry-lingo nomenclature that differs than colloquial meaning, they should've stipulated it in the contract, which they didn't. 

Industry standard definition always trumps. 

b. The entire plane not being considered boarded doesn't mean he individually wasn't boarded.

But he can be unboarded involuntarily at any point due to force majeure. Once the airline involuntarily revokes his boarding privilege, he has no right to stay in that seat. It's technically trespass if he doesn't leave in a reasonable period, as well as a violation of FAA regulations. 

A House isn't cleaned before all rooms have been cleaned, that doesn't mean that half way thru some rooms weren't already cleaned.  

But the house isn't cleaned. Similarly, boarding isn't complete. If you're in my home and I revoke your right of entry, you now have to leave, even though you've already entered. Once the license (permission) is revoked, the licensee must leave. Boarding is similar to a license to entry and can be revoked by the licenser (airline) for cause (internal labor/scheduling issue).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Involuntary denial of boarding happens. There is no real negotiation. They get as many people to take the deal as possible, then involuntarily remove the rest at the same deal. The money is honestly just an incentive. There's no present entitlement because the maximum amount they can pay out will depend on what flight they can get him on and when it will arrive. $800 is probably based on the fact that they don't think they can get him there within two hours of his original arrival. The max is $1350, by the way, not $1300, my mistake. And this is no longer a negotiation as to whether he gets to stay on the plane. He may get to negotiate up how much they give him, but he's off that plane due to whatever lottery system they employed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And you'll probably have lawyers argue both ways, but unfortunately, your definition doesn't matter. Their definition (more specifically, the industry's) does. And I strongly doubt any airline will want to consider passengers as "boarded" at any point before they have to. So for the purposes of involuntarily denying boarding, I would imagine that United considers that denial of boarding can happen even after physical boarding has occurred. It's the same as taking back an invitation to enter a space and asking someone to leave after they've entered. The laws of trespass would probably apply. Just because you're comfortable in my house and thought you'd be there for a while doesn't mean I can't kick you out because I have an emergency appointment I have to deal with (not a perfect analogy but you get the idea).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He has physically boarded the plane as in he is currently onboard it. The boarding process is only complete once the doors are closed. The language is specific to the boarding process, not individual boarding. Technically, anyone that enters a plane has boarded it, including maintenance crew. They then leave the plane, deboarding it. This has nothing to do with boarding the plane for the purposes of transit as part of the pre-flight procedure. A plane is fully boarded once everyone is onboard and the doors are closed. At this point, control of the passengers transfers to the pilot and crew. Anyone can be deplaned after boarding has completed for a certain set of reasons. However, the boarding process is not indefinite. The process lasts from when passengers line up to begin boarding until the doors close, at which point no one is allowed on board the plane absent extreme exigency. The only thing that can happen is letting people off, which is not boarding, it's removing. 

This passenger has been involuntarily denied boarding by United, even though he is already on the plane. More to the point, his right to be on the plane has been revoked by the airline to cover their force majeure event, namely, their need to have their crew flown to Louisville to crew another flight. This is covered in the contract of carriage under Rules 24 and 25. Even though he was on the plane (he has boarded) he has subsequently been denied boarding (been asked to leave involuntarily). At this point he, by law, has to leave per FAA regulations. He can appeal and complain and never fly United again, but he cannot stay on that plane. United had the right to call the police to deplane him and exercised it. 

He can feel free to litigate this claim, which he'll probably lose, or he can proceed with the other claims, where he has a much higher chance of winning. The law and morals don't always line up. This is one of those cases so while we may agree United is in the wrong, they have no legal liability here for simply revoking his boarding privileges.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The common definition would be the industry definition. 

Wikipedia: "Boarding starts with entering the vehicle and ends with the seating of each passenger and closure of thedoors." 

I strongly doubt any airline would dispute that definition because anything else would mean they are responsible for passenger conduct while the plane is not in transit. 

Also, the concept of when an individual has boarded and when the boarding process is complete are two separate concepts. One can occur before the other.  

Sort of. Just because you've boarded doesn't mean you now own that seat for the transit. You can be deboarded/deplaned for cause. Boarding had not completed at the time the passenger was asked to give up his seat because there were still passengers waiting to board, namely the flight crew taking his seat. United will likely argue they had cause to deboard the passenger and will, if we're being real, win on that point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but if he bought the ticket through United, that's where the passenger's contract lies and any subrogation is United's problem. I'm sure there's a vicarious liability clause in the Republic-United contract. Regardless, the United policy governs in terms of passenger rights because a passenger can't be expected to know their rights on a subcontractor when they signed the contract with a different company.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi top comment! I'm gonna hijack you like a United passenger because I wanna point out that this bestofed comment is also wrong. It's not illegal for them to remove the passenger at random from the plane to address a labor issue (namely getting their crew to a flight at another airport). Legally, they're in the clear. By common definition, boarding is only completed when the doors are closed and as the poor man was clearly able to reenter the plane, boarding was not completed. Just because their crew is technically flying standby doesn't mean that their crew is denied priority to make it to the Louisville flight. It's in their contract of carriage as part of voluntary/involuntary delays due to force majeure. As long as they provide reasonable compensation and get the passenger to the destination within a reasonable period after the original ticketed arrival time, they're clear. They're not good people for handling it this way, but they're legally alright. 

The cops, on the other hand, are looking at a law suit for excessive force and dragging him off the plane. In addition, the airport and United will probably get sued for not attending to him after he had his head banged. Not to mention the FAA is likely going to want to know how someone who was removed from a plane was so easily able to get back on it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Viggo broke his toe kicking the helmet in the scene where Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli discover the site of orc/Uruk-Hai battle and the Rohirrim assault on the camp in The Two Towers. It was an ad lib with consequences. When he roars in grief and frustration at not finding Merry and Pippin, more than a little of that is pain. 

Sean lacerated his foot when he was wading into the river at the scene at the end of The Fellowship of the Rings where Sam chases after Frodo while Frodo is rowing to the other bank to head to Mordor alone. He stepped on a piece of glass in the riverbed. When he cries out as he nearly drowns trying to get to Frodo, some tears were pain tears. 

I believe these injury takes were used in the final cut. Additional fun facts, when Aragorn knocks the knife out of the air that the Uruk-Hai leader throws at him after Aragorn finds Boromir at the end of Fellowship, that's real. He nearly got hit. The Uruk-Hai actor threw a real knife way too close and Viggo had to react and block the knife with his sword. Also, the charge of the Rohirrim on Pelennor Fields involved finding pretty much every available horse in New Zealand that could be transported to that spot and filming them charging.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rule ~~23~~ 24 or 25 under the CoC. Specifically addresses labor shortages and can easily be read to include this situation. This isn't a regular standby passenger, this is four members of a flight crew that needed to get to the airport and probably had union stipulations as to how that can occur. This typically happens by flying them standby but end of the day, even though the labor issue is internal to United, they're allowed to take your seat to get them where they need to go, provided they make reasonable efforts to get you to your destination as well, which, technically, they did. United has the right to appropriate seats on its own plane to transport its own crew to address a labor shortage. Once he was ordered off the plane and refused, their action in calling the cops was appropriate under federal law. The police most likely used excessive force, but a woman being distressed on camera and a video that doesn't actually capture how the injury occurred are not enough to establish excessive force. Passenger testimony might.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because even if you plan on arriving a full week prior to your important appointment, the airlines can find ways to keep delaying you and rebooking you until you miss that appointment, and you have zero legal recourse. 

No, because they're required to get you there within a reasonable time of your scheduled arrival. They're not required to get you there exactly when the ticket says you'll arrive. So if they can't accommodate getting you there within a reasonable period given the circumstances, then you have a case. That case will also be a goldmine. 

Again, though, the implication of what you're saying is that nobody who has to be in a certain place at a certain time should take a risk with flying an airline. Ever. 

Sure. Weather that prevents flying happens and can ground flights for a week. You're not the only person who had to fly that day and rebooking is going to be a nightmare given a limited number of planes and pilots plus people who have previously booked flights for after planes can fly again. That's not on them, that's on you. I'm not saying this situation is in actuality analogous, but contractually and legally, it's basically the same. 

Shit happens and people get stuck. It happens to doctors who need to see patients just like it happens to people in other professions. Everything you do is a calculated risk. Airlines can't bump you indefinitely, but they're legally allowed to overbook and legally allowed to bump you based on internal criteria, as long as they get you to the destination within a certain time frame. If you have a problem with that, take it up with Congress and the FAA. Seriously. Obama actually championed regulations about exactly this that were passed and appear to have been gently and quietly rolled back. 

The harsh truth of lawyering is that what is legal and what is right are not necessarily the same thing. This is one of those cases.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hard to say without meeting the client (I'm also not an Illinois lawyer so I'm not sure on their tort law). In terms of general strategy, I'd feel comfortable sending demand letters to both threatening litigation. United could have handled this in a much better way. I'd ask for a little higher than reasonable and we'd probably settle for reasonable or just under. The police would be a better case, but I'd have to get other passengers to testify and I'd have to prove him getting hit on the head wasn't an accident. 

Now, there's an interesting case for damages from the injury and possibly leaving him unattended after the injury in such a way that he could get back on the plane. I'd think the airport, police, and United would be jointly and severally liable for that (a high degree of negligence). Of course, this all depends on facts we don't have. But *that* claim is the real lawsuit and where he'll get his money. 

As always, none of this is a substitute for talking to a lawyer and none of this I've said should be construed as legal advice.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To make the suit go away? Probably in the tens of thousands at most. Legally, they're in the clear. Sadly, laws and morals are not the same. 

I'm a lawyer and can claim I have an important hearing the next day to decide a death penalty case, but absent proof, I'm SoL. Merely needing to get back to do his job, absent some further showing of need, is not enough to justify him being on that specific flight.  

PD might settle for much more because of use of excessive force, but that's a high bar.  

Edit: Worth noting that unless the airline is aware of some time sensitive issue and agrees to accommodate it, like transportation of an organ or knowingly transporting someone for life saving treatment, it's up to the doctor to get home on time and manage his schedule, not the airline. He may be right and have to see patients, but that doesn't mean the airline is required to go above and beyond unless they want to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably not many actually. Assuming the people removing the doctor were cops, they're the ones with the real problem (unless United's manager lied about why the guy was being removed). United is facing a PR nightmare, a lawsuit for damages related to being forced to reschedule, and a drop in business. However, they'll likely win on the rescheduling if it goes to trial. 

The common carrier rules only sort of apply because when you buy a ticket, you agree to the possibility you might be bumped. Most likely any lawsuit would involve shared liability and the police department that removed the plaintiff. Illinois has a joint and severable liability statute which will apply. 

However, to make it go away, United will settle. The PD will too, probably.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair point. I should have clarified and said "will make the predators endangered."

There is minimal livestock in Alaska. It's not a thing that people are overly concerned with and farmers already have the ability to shoot wolves that are harassing their livestock. With people, again, attacks and rare and typically do not occur in the cities. Again, when they happen, people are allowed to kill the animal in self defense. You're more in danger of being attacked by a moose in Anchorage than a bear or wolf. The black bears tend to run away and wolves don't come into town. Same for the rest of the state. The only pets that get attacked are off leash. It almost never happens that a predator will attack a leashed animal with a human and if it does, that predator is hunted down. 

There is a natural predator prey balance. Their numbers rise and fall through a regular cycle. The government of Alaska inflated prey numbers to ensure ample hunting for people from the lower 48 by, in turn, culling the predator population. They are not a threat to humans in the Bush and the ones that are get taken care of. This purely about profit from hunting licenses.  

On a tangential note, keeping prey population this high is really not great for the tundra.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually did live there and worked on this exact issue. Wolves were not and are still not some massive existential threat to life in the Bush. You are legally allowed to kill a wolf to protect yourself. The wolves that came into Fairbanks and Nome and other communities were killed because they were a threat to the human population. Board of Game routinely kills predators that pose a risk to human populations and everyone's fine with it except when they (routinely) kill the wrong animal. Wolves tend to stay away from popular areas anyway.

Nice strawman with the endangered species argument, by the way. Remind me where my post had anything to do with that? I was discussing hunting practices and that per fair chase, many hunters dislike denning and aerial hunting. Especially when it comes to denning cubs.  </TEXT>

Actually read Gorsuch's dissent. He effectively rewrote the facts to suit a narrative that the trucker had the "safe" option to stay in the truck in below freezing temperatures with no working heat. By Gorsuch's standard, he could stay or walk away, but he could not unhitch the cab and drive away, even if driving away was the only safe option. He could not drive the truck with the trailer hitched, hence why he was stuck to begin with. And he was losing feeling. 


The law was specially designed to protect employees in a situation such as this. Even though the employer did not permit truckers to unhitch the trailer and drive away, exigency is a real thing and is often a defense. The fact that Gorsuch couldn't see this is a failing. It's exactly what people talk about when they discuss activist judges that are so far removed from the consequences of their decisions. His logical basis only works if you ignore the fact that life or death situations arise and require exceptions. A trucker has not signed a contract to die for his or her cargo. 


From Gorsuch's actual dissent:

It might be fair to ask whether TransAms decision was a wise or kind one. 
But its not our job to answer questions like that. Our only task is to decide
whether the decision was an illegal one. The Department of Labor says that
TransAm violated federal law, in particular 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(B). But that
statute only forbids employers from firing employees who refuse[] to operate a
vehicle out of safety concerns. And, of course, nothing like that happened here. 
The trucker in this case wasnt fired for *refusing to operate his vehicle*. Indeed,
his employer gave him the very option the statute says it must: once he voiced
safety concerns, TransAm expressly  and by everyones admission  permitted
him to sit and remain where he was and wait for help. The trucker was fired only
after he declined the statutorily protected option (refuse to operate) and chose
instead to operate his vehicle in a manner he thought wise but his employer did not. And theres simply no law anyone has pointed us to giving employees the
right to operate their vehicles in ways their employers forbid. Maybe the
Department would like such a law, maybe someday Congress will adorn our
federal statute books with such a law. But it isnt there yet. And it isnt our job
to write one  or to allow the Department to write one in Congresss place.

First off, this is pedantic, but I don't like judges using contractions in decisions. It's lazy and unprofessional (hypocrisy is noted), but it's not a substantive criticism. Secondly, exigent circumstances dictate that sometimes the facts on the ground require breaking with company policy to save a life. However, employees shouldn't be penalized for taking action to save themselves when they are in danger of freezing to death. In fact, that's the entire point of 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(B). Strict textualism completely misses this and means that you now have to create laws that will cover every possible scenario, a sheer impossibility. 

In fact, the way the other two justices got around the "operate a vehicle" question is by using the *Chevron* standard. 

Because we are reviewing the DOLs
interpretation of a statute it administers, we begin by asking whether Congress
has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. 
Here, the term operate is not defined in the statute. If . . . Congress has not
directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose
its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an
administrative interpretation. Id. at 843 (footnote omitted). Instead, we examine
whether the agencys [interpretation] is based on a permissible construction of
the statute. Id.

TransAms argument equates the term operate, as used in the statute,
with driving. **However, TransAm has not directed this court to any authority for
the proposition that Congress intended the refusal-to-operate provision of the STAA to be interpreted so narrowly, and has not explained how such a narrow
interpretation furthers the purposes of the STAA.** The ARB interpreted the term
operate to encompass not only driving, but other uses of a vehicle when it is
within the control of the employee.^3
Thus, under the ARBs interpretation, the
refusal-to-operate provision could cover a situation in which an employee refuses
to use his vehicle in the manner directed by his employer even if that refusal
results in the employee driving the vehicle. Thus, by way of example, an
employee who partially unloads an overweight trailer in direct contravention of
his employers instruction to continue pulling the overweight trailer on the public
roadways, has refused to operate the vehicle for purposes of the STAA even if the
employee completes the trip after unloading the trailer. See Beveridge v. Waste
Stream Envtl., Inc., ARB No. 97-137, 1997 WL 806522, at *1 (ARB Dec. 23,
1997). Similarly, an employee who moves a disabled trailer from the middle of a
busy roadway to the shoulder of the road after being told by his employer to
remain in the roadway, has refused to operate his vehicle for purposes of the
STAA whistle-blower protection under the interpretation of  31105(a)(1)(B)(ii)
adopted by the ARB.

Emphasis added. 

Now let's look at the purpose of this law, in particular 49 U.S.C.  31100(2): 

The purpose of this subchapter is to ensure that the Secretary, States, and other political jurisdictions work in partnership to establish programs to improve motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety to support a safe and efficient transportation system by(2) **increasing administrative flexibility** and developing and enforcing effective, compatible, and cost-beneficial motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety regulations and practices, including improving enforcement of State and local traffic safety laws and regulations;

The ARB specifically exists to interpret and enforce this and related laws. It's part of the delegation of executive authority and the understanding that agencies exist to interpret and execute the law in a fair and equitable fashion (YMMV). 

The ARBs interpretation of  31105(a)(1)(B)(ii)
furthers the purpose of the STAA by prohibiting an employer from discharging an
insubordinate employee whose insubordination was motivated by the employees
reasonable apprehension of serious injury to himself or members of the public. 
Thus, we defer to the DOLs interpretation that the term operate as used in
 31105(a)(1)(B) is not coextensive with the term drive.^4

Now footnote 4 is especially pretty. 

^4
The dissent takes issue with our application of Chevron to the question
before us, deeming it an uninvited foray into step two of Chevronland. 
Dissenting Op. at 2. We received our invitation from TransAm in its opening
brief. Appellant Br. at 13 n.5. TransAm, the appellant in this matter, relied on
Chevron to argue the ARBs construction of the STAA should be rejected. 

The dissent further criticizes us for moving to the second prong of the
Chevron analysis after concluding the term operate is not defined in the statute. 
The dissent believes Congresss intent can be easily determined by simply
choosing a favorite dictionary definition of the word and applying that to quickly
conclude the statute is not ambiguous at all. However, in addition to not defining
the term operate, Congress also did not unambiguously express its intent with
regard to the definition of the term. See United States v. Seminole Nation of
Okla., 321 F.3d 939, 944 (10th Cir. 2002). **Thus, the only way to resolve the
matter we have been asked by TransAm to review is to move to Chevrons second
step.**

Even if we disregard TransAms request that we analyze this case using the
Chevron paradigm and employ the analysis used by the dissent, we would still
reach the same conclusion. We, too, have found a dictionary definition of the word operate and discovered it means to control the functioning of. Operate,
Oxford Dictionaries Pro,
http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/operate (last
visited July 8, 2016). This definition clearly encompasses activities other than
driving. **For that reason, the dissents conclusion that a truck driver is
operating his truck when he refuses to drive it but not when he refuses to
remain in control of it while awaiting its repair, is curious. The only logical
explanation is that the dissent has concluded Congress used the word operate in
the statute when it really meant drive.** We are more comfortable limiting our
review to the language Congress actually used. As the dissenting judge stated
during oral argument, Our job isnt to legislate and add new words that arent
present in the statute.

Emphasis mine. A true smack down on Gorsuch claiming strict textualism. 

Because the refusal-to-operate provision can be interpreted to cover
multiple uses of a vehicle while it is in the control of an employee, the ARB did
not err in concluding that Maddins act of unhitching the trailer and driving off in
the truck was a refusal to operate the tractor-trailer for purposes of
 31105(a)(1)(B)(ii). Maddin was instructed by Mr. Cluck to operate his rig by
remaining with the trailer until the repairperson arrived. He disobeyed that
instruction and drove off in the truck, leaving the trailer behind. Thus, as the
ARB concluded, although Maddin actually drove the truck after unhitching it, he
refused to operate his tractor-trailer in the manner instructed by his employer. 
This conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.

results in the employee driving the vehicle. Thus, by way of example, an
employee who partially unloads an overweight trailer in direct contravention of
his employers instruction to continue pulling the overweight trailer on the public
roadways, has refused to operate the vehicle for purposes of the STAA even if the
employee completes the trip after unloading the trailer. See Beveridge v. Waste
Stream Envtl., Inc., ARB No. 97-137, 1997 WL 806522, at *1 (ARB Dec. 23,
1997). Similarly, an employee who moves a disabled trailer from the middle of a
busy roadway to the shoulder of the road after being told by his employer to
remain in the roadway, has refused to operate his vehicle for purposes of the
STAA whistle-blower protection under the interpretation of  31105(a)(1)(B)(ii)
adopted by the ARB.

Emphasis added. 

Now let's look at the purpose of this law, in particular 49 U.S.C.  31100(2): 

The purpose of this subchapter is to ensure that the Secretary, States, and other political jurisdictions work in partnership to establish programs to improve motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety to support a safe and efficient transportation system by(2) **increasing administrative flexibility** and developing and enforcing effective, compatible, and cost-beneficial motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety regulations and practices, including improving enforcement of State and local traffic safety laws and regulations;

The ARB specifically exists to interpret and enforce this and related laws. It's part of the delegation of executive authority and the understanding that agencies exist to interpret and execute the law in a fair and equitable fashion (YMMV). 

The ARBs interpretation of  31105(a)(1)(B)(ii)
furthers the purpose of the STAA by prohibiting an employer from discharging an
insubordinate employee whose insubordination was motivated by the employees
reasonable apprehension of serious injury to himself or members of the public. 
Thus, we defer to the DOLs interpretation that the term operate as used in
 31105(a)(1)(B) is not coextensive with the term drive.^4

Now footnote 4 is especially pretty.

The dissent takes issue with our application of Chevron to the question
before us, deeming it an uninvited foray into step two of Chevronland. 
Dissenting Op. at 2. We received our invitation from TransAm in its opening
brief. Appellant Br. at 13 n.5. TransAm, the appellant in this matter, relied on
Chevron to argue the ARBs construction of the STAA should be rejected. 

The dissent further criticizes us for moving to the second prong of the
Chevron analysis after concluding the term operate is not defined in the statute. 
The dissent believes Congresss intent can be easily determined by simply
choosing a favorite dictionary definition of the word and applying that to quickly
conclude the statute is not ambiguous at all. However, in addition to not defining
the term operate, Congress also did not unambiguously express its intent with
regard to the definition of the term. See United States v. Seminole Nation of
Okla., 321 F.3d 939, 944 (10th Cir. 2002). **Thus, the only way to resolve the
matter we have been asked by TransAm to review is to move to Chevrons second
step.**

Even if we disregard TransAms request that we analyze this case using the
Chevron paradigm and employ the analysis used by the dissent, we would still
reach the same conclusion. We, too, have found a dictionary definition of the word operate and discovered it means to control the functioning of. Operate,
Oxford Dictionaries Pro,
http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/operate (last
visited July 8, 2016). This definition clearly encompasses activities other than
driving. **For that reason, the dissents conclusion that a truck driver is
operating his truck when he refuses to drive it but not when he refuses to
remain in control of it while awaiting its repair, is curious. The only logical
explanation is that the dissent has concluded Congress used the word operate in
the statute when it really meant drive.** We are more comfortable limiting our
review to the language Congress actually used. As the dissenting judge stated
during oral argument, Our job isnt to legislate and add new words that arent
present in the statute.

Emphasis mine. A true smack down on Gorsuch claiming strict textualism. 

Because the refusal-to-operate provision can be interpreted to cover
multiple uses of a vehicle while it is in the control of an employee, the ARB did
not err in concluding that Maddins act of unhitching the trailer and driving off in
the truck was a refusal to operate the tractor-trailer for purposes of
 31105(a)(1)(B)(ii). Maddin was instructed by Mr. Cluck to operate his rig by
remaining with the trailer until the repairperson arrived. He disobeyed that
instruction and drove off in the truck, leaving the trailer behind. Thus, as the
ARB concluded, although Maddin actually drove the truck after unhitching it, he
refused to operate his tractor-trailer in the manner instructed by his employer. 
This conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.

	<TEXT> Because most cases aren't actually all that contentious. Most cases actually have a majority of judges/justices going the same way on appeal, with a few differences on how the law should work to get there. It's the ones where there is an actual ideological difference on how the law should work with radical affects on outcome and real world implications where the makeup of the court matters. Again, Frozen Trucker is the perfect example because it shows the failing of strict textualism: inequitable results, which is in antithesis to the concept of a justice system. 

It's like the Westboro Baptist Church case about protesting a soldier's funeral. Basically unanimous for WBC. Alito's dissent basically said it bordered on fighting words or hate speech. But even the hard core liberals recognized WBC had the First Amendment on their side.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a practice called denning. It's widely condemned because it completely ignores the "fair chase" rule. Alaska got in a bit of trouble because the Board of Game under Palin was allowed to kill denning wolf cubs. Since it's technically not denning if they're outside the den, they'd lure the parents out, kill them, claim they couldn't find a zoo for the cubs, then kill the cubs. 

This is also around when the aerial wolf hunting campaign started. Bullshit practice. Hunters I know in Alaska claimed that it leveled the playing field because by the time they got close enough to shoot, the wolf could smell them and run away. My theory was these guys just suck at hunting and love killing them with an even greater advantage.

Bin Laden founded al Qaeda which was responsible for the attack. 

Bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on June 24, 1998.The1998 U.S. Embassy bombingswere a series of attacks that occurred on August 7, 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneoustruck bombexplosions at the United Statesembassiesin the major East African cities ofDar es Salaam, Tanzania andNairobi, Kenya. The attacks were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the United States public for the first time, and resulted in the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation placing bin Laden on itsTen Most Wantedlist.

.  .  . 

At the end of 2000,Richard Clarkerevealed that Islamic militants headed by bin Laden had planned atriple attack on January 3, 2000, which would have included bombings in Jordan of theRadisson SAS HotelinAmmanand tourists atMount Neboand a site on theJordan River, the sinking of the destroyerUSSThe Sullivansin Yemen, as well as an attack on a target within the United States. The plan was foiled by the arrest of the Jordanian terrorist cell, the sinking of the explosive-filled skiff intended to target the destroyer, and the arrest ofAhmed Ressam.
