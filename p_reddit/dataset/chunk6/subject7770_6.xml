	<TEXT> Have you guys ever felt for a short period of time that your depression was gone for good? Well sometimes I get that feeling. And for that split second in my life I can really smile and put an end to all my problems.  Today is one of my best friends birthday,  I basically grew up with him we knew each other since elementary. I shouldn't say happy birthday to him. I haven't talked to him in months.  When I was diagnosed with depression and had my suicide attempt he left out of my life ( or so I thought ) he saw my suicide attempt as a form of a mid life crises ( I was 18 at that time)  and the only real support I had in my life was my ex girlfriend. I really loved my ex girlfriend a lot she was the only person who would make me feel like there was something  to live for. We where together for almost 3 years and that was something really rare to be seen as a teenager. We really did love each other but my depression made me feel like a burden to her life. Scared of her falling out of love with me as well as breaking up with me, and feeling like a burden to her life I decided to break up with her. While we were broken up we would still hangout kiss and do boyfriend and girlfriend type of stuff. She would mention that my bestfriend would constantly message her. And after a few months passed by she told me he asked her out and she rejected him. Then after that I started to notice that my bestfriend would start to message me only when me and my ex and i would hang out.  I found out that he would say stuff like "I really feel bad for him and I really wish I could help him with his depression " to her,  and she would say that's so sweet of him...I started to feel like he was just using my depression to get closer to her. I never thought it would have worked or that he would go that low to use my depression as a tool to get closer to her.  After a few months passed I felt like my depression was going away and that me and my ex and I could be together and start a normal life. She rejected me,  I was really destroyed but I began to move on. I started seeing another girl( who has a boyfriend ) and it made my ex girlfriend really jealous. My ex started giving me more attention but when she found out that I had sex with the other girl she cut me off from her life for about a month . As clich as it sounds I really liked my ex girlfriend,  not just as a lover but a bestfriend,  after all she was the only person who was supportive when I had my suicide attempt. We arranged to hangout before Christmas and that's when I find out that my ex girlfriend and my bestfriend had been kissing and going on dates. When I found out that they kissed my body turned pale and cold.  I felt so betrayed on both sides. Why him? He used me to get closer to you? Do you know how much of an ass he's been to me? All these questions would spiral out of my head. I felt like I stabbed in the back while I was already on the ground because of this stupid depression. Out of desperation I tried so hard to win over my ex,  it made me look so weak and desperate,  but I really didn't want to lose her. I would cry for nights,  then to add insult to injury my bestfriend would send me messages like "she was never truly happy with you... Ect" . I didn't realize that by trying to get her back I would appeare as desperate,  as well as needy... And soon the pieces of the puzzles  began to  click. She didn't have feelings for me anymore and the final piece of the puzzle was found when she chose him to be her Valentines . I decided to move on with my life after that, it's been hell. I feel like I will never be able to date again. I don't have a close friend anymore. I hardly text people or go out , I dropped out of all my classes this semester in college because I  just feel like  an emotional wreck, but today is my bestfriends birthday. The scum who I needed support from when I was at my weakest. The scum who was my bestfriend for 10 years.... the scum who I wish I was still bestfriends with. The scum who used my depression to get closer to my ex. I just don't know if I can text him happy birthday...  It hurts too much... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, honestly being attractive does not make things better. I have been told many times that I'm attractive,  but I'm still here in the same situation az you are. I have issues with depression that have caused me to be FA. Being attractive won't make you find true love. Being attractive will not cure all your solution. Just remember that all these issues are just in your head.
