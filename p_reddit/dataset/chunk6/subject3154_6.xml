	<TEXT> I'm sorry I must have misunderstood you. Well I personally would cut him some slack, releasing a game can be very stressful and his wife just gave birth to their daughter. He doesn't seem to take twitter seriously which is debatable whether he should but then again he kinda brought it over himself. Still the BoI subreddit is incredibly quick at jumping to conclusions and completely exaggerating. I remember when Dark Bum was nerfed slightly(it is still very much overpowered in my opinion and wins runs by himself) everyone flipped their shit and when Krampus' Head was nerfed the same thing happened. There was also a period of time in which people thought that the amount of blue flies you could have orbiting around you was limited because of inaccurate patch notes. I totally agree, accurate patch notes and clear messages could have atleast lessened the negative reactions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did not imply I thought it was funny, he literally posted that. Also I think he won't be losing customers because of that specific move, maybe some because of the whole convoluted thing. The whole release was very ambiguous so I think we should wait and atleast hear him out instead of grabbing the pitchforks like /r/bindingofisaac did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with most points, however let's take games like Gone Home, Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable or The Beginner's Guide. All games that people call "walking simulators". They can mostly be experienced the same way when you watch a let's play. Does that mean that all of these games are failures, because some of them don't have engaging gameplay mechanics but an interesting story or concept? I don't think so, though there's no doubt that developing  such a game can be financially dangerous because of YouTube and Twitch, yes but that doesn't make the games badly designed. For example: The Stanley Parable is one of my favourite games of all time and I could have experienced it on YouTube, which would be a shame but I think that developers are well aware of that issue and if they chose to create such a "walking simulator", depending on the quality of the game, they should know what to expect saleswise. </TEXT>
