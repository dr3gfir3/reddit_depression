	<TEXT> When I was young (10 or 11) there was a poor family who let their kids do whatever they wanted, they were out as late as they wanted, didn't eat healthy food, their house was a state, etc.  They were also always in trouble at school, never doing their homework, the boy took his pet cat to school in a lunchbox to show everybody, etc.

I can't remember how it started but the boy and girl (Andy and Debbie) came to my house and played with my toys and my mum made them food. This happened several times over a small period of time, but eventually they stopped coming.

Anyway, fast forward 10 years or so and it turns out Debbie had lured a mentally handicapped girl to her apartment, her and her boyfriend beat her up and stabbed her to death and cut off her limbs with knives and wrapped her body in a sleeping bag and hid it in the cupboard.

They got caught and she went to jail.

I'm sort of torn because she's always been an arsehole, but I'm sure a lot of that is down to not being raised properly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But you're insinuating that all legal gun owners are law abiding citizens? I listened to a podcast about a guy in a bad part of town who was unemployed and made money by legally buying guns for people with chequered criminal records who couldn't buy their own.

Also, you say research is required into causes of violence, but there will always be violence, sometimes without cause. And the easier it is for these violent people to obtain guns, the more devastating the result on everyone else.

You're right, it'd be difficult to implement any meaningful change with so many guns already in circulation.  </TEXT>

UserDefaults.standard.set(input.text, forKey: "username")

I set the above code to the push of a button, making what text was in the "input" text box globally accessible.

I then went to the view controller I needed the label to appear and called the userdefault text string.

Much easier than what I previously tried to do by pushing the text to each view controller in turn with the segue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does sound like you need a hobby. 

Spending all day with your kids (depending their ages) is probably rewarding but not stimulating you socially if they're too young to talk, etc.

Your job has you around people but again probably isn't the most stimulating in terms of conversation or letting you be yourself.

I would suggest you try join a sports team, or do a night school class once a week or something similar just to get you around others where you can just be you.

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot! I figured out a way earlier today with AVAudioPlayer but it doesn't seem like the most optimised solution so I'll look at what you're suggesting tomorrow!

I have 4 buttons on the bottom of my app to navigate (imagine like twitter) so on every view controller there's the same four buttons that need the same noise. So I need to programme the same noise to various buttons!

I'm new to this, but given how efficient the drag and drop interface seems to be thus far, and how it subsequently converts movements to code, I'm surprised adding audio to a button isn't also just drag and drop! If only...

Thanks a lot for your input, very much appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, I agree with you, but seeing how even unique girls are great and another one comes along is true in life post-education too! Hope that realisation doesn't stop you settling down in the long term!

And I'm the same, about a month before exam time at university I would go cold turkey from seeing my girlfriend and friends to study all day every day! I managed to get a first class degree whilst managing to slack for a lot of the year!

Personally if I could change something about my university experience I don't think I would! As much as I loved it I don't even think I'd relive it if given the chance as those intense study sessions were a pain in the arse! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see your point but I disagree that that's universally sound advise! What if you meet someone you're crazy about? 

Plus lots of partners wouldn't impose on your freedom! 

In university I had one girlfriend for a few months, dumped her, was single for a year or so, then met my current girlfriend and was with her for the rest of my university time and still am, that's been 7 years!

My first girlfriend tried to control me and was the fun police. When I was single I had loads of fun and accumulated typical crazy college style stories. The only difference between being with my current gf and being single at uni was sleeping with other people. I could still go out drinking with the lads whenever I wanted and not need to ask "permission" or I could come in at 5am half naked with a stolen sign post etc and she wouldn't care. Having a GF doesn't need to change your college experience if you have the right GF.

TL;DR; having a girlfriend and having fun at college aren't mutually exclusive if your girlfriend is sound. </TEXT>

So much nope in one post. </TEXT>
