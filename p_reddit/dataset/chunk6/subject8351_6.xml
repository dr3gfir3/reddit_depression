	<TEXT>  Jeff Sessions, had ordered the United States Marshals Service to extend a full protective detail to Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, for as much as $1 million a month

Ok, security for the Department of Education at about $12 million a year.

 Expanded security appears to be in the offing at the Environmental Protection Agency, as well, where administrators have traditionally received door-to-door security. In recent weeks, though, the agency has requested funds to add 10 full-time staff members to form a 24-hour security detail for its current administrator, Scott Pruitt, budget documents show.

Add in the EPA for another $12 mil (guessing), so that is $24 million plus any other security they want to throw at the administration for the dislike and disdain they have received. </TEXT>

In 2018, Republicans will be defending 23 seats that Clinton won. If Democrats can net 24 seats, they would recapture the majority.

2018 will be a big year to try and stop the pillaging of this country that the Trump administration is doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New guidelines:

 Federal prosecutors are now required to pursue felony charges against immigrants who commit document fraud or identity theft. Assuming a false identity or aggravated identity fraud will carry a two-year mandatory minimum sentence. Sessions said prosecutors  should also prioritize fraudulent or green card marriages.

So we will be giving the private prisons more slave labor. Does Jeff Sessions have any investments in the prison system? Also, how the fuck can you prove a fraudulent marriage?

 Prosecutors are also required to pursue felony charges against anyone transporting or harboring three or more aliens, Sessions said. We are going to shut down and jail those who have been profiting off this lawlessness.

I guess you are filth if you even talk to or help illegal aliens, you will be jailed for association. Again, which of the Trumpster's have stock in for profit prisons?

 Sessions also said he had directed all U.S. Attorneys offices to prioritize prosecution of assaults on federal law enforcement. If someone dares to assault one of our folks in the line of duty, they will do federal time for it, Sessions said.

Fucking Christ, its not like we as a Nation even trust the police officers to be truthful. Now there will be either MORE recordings or less, depends on the implied threats that police use on people. Not like your word as a citizen stands up to a police officer in court. Their word is always taken as gold even if they are the ones at fault. </TEXT>
