	<TEXT> My father's line has always produced sons.

From my father I got my pale hair and my sharp jaw and how I could pull anyone my way with a smile and a wink. My father has never worked a day unless it was on his back, and yet we were all swaddled in Louis Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent. He could steal a man's fortune in a single conversation, and he taught us all the same. It's the nature of our kind, half survival and half sport.

My brothers were content to play at housecats when they were lions, but it was always hard for me to hide my irritation at the teeming masses of humanity. Instead of expensive clubs, I went to academia and rejected my father's offers of sugar daddies and escort gigs. I got a real job and learned how to survive like mortal men did.

One of things I learned was that premade food was a ripoff, and that making my own feasts was far better. Making my own took more time, yes, but if my minimum wage job was any indication my time wasn't worth much anyway. 

Sundays were spent making bread and chili, soups and stews, and then I'd freeze portions for the coming week. I taught myself about spices and flavors to add a little life to my bland meals, and punching dough soothed the week's built up irritation. My little studio apartment became a kingdom of solitude where I could drop the mask and not have to deal with everyone who thought themselves entitled to my affections.

I live like this, quiet and serene, until my junior year. In that year, two vital things happened  I officially declared my neuroscience major, and Doctor Erikson became my advisor.

His office was in the newest building on campus, its clear pane windows and wooden beams showing how modern and youthful he was. Doctor Erikson worked out, wore glasses, and cracked jokes, so everyone wanted his dick. I just wanted a flow chart to medical school or perhaps a PhD program. Erikson couldn't stop touching my leg, praising my intelligence, giving sly compliments to my appearance, and I gritted my teeth and endured as I have so often before.

"I hope to have you in my classes, Jack," Erikson purred at the end of our advising session, like he was the first professor who wanted to fuck me. Animal.

Most professors learned to clamp down on their desires by the second cool dismissal, but perhaps Erikson was too emboldened by the ardent desires of his freshmen students to back down. To him, I was just a haughty student that needed to be worn down to accept his lust.

First came the coveted research position in his lab group; my lab mates resented me until I, blessedly, took over the dirty task of giving mice schizophrenia. Then, Erikson started to find more and more reasons to come by my lab table, leering and looming over me as I tried to work. Anonymous gifts of flowers and poetry. Odd excuses for advising sessions. Wandering hands. I endured with the patience of a stone, drawing Erikson closer and closer. It was a dance my father taught me, and he didn't let me leave the nest until I memorized all the steps.

It all came to a crescendo on Saturday.

I was the only one in the lab, looking over the blood tests I had started the Friday before. The quiet whirling of computers and the chattering of mice was interrupted by Erikson opening the door with a creak. I acknowledged him with a hum; his hands slid on to my shoulders, fingers brushing against my pale neck.

"No one would question it if you stepped down from your position," Erikson threatened. "This is a stressful role for an undergraduate."

"I'm not stressed, Doctor," I said neutrally. Erikson squeezed his hands around my biceps.

"It's okay to be weak, Jack," Erikson whispered, his breath humid on the back of my neck. "Let me help you *relax.*"

I made a choice. I took Erikson by the hand and led him to my apartment.

He laid upon my crisp white sheets and watched me undressed down to my unmarred skin. I stripped him bare and sat on his lap, kissing him with my rosy mouth. It was easy to make him think I loved him back, and he sung my praises between my thighs like they were a temple. He clutched at me like I was his possession, like he had the right to bruise me.

Afterwards, Erikson rested on his back and I watched him recover. He would not be satisfied by a single night, no one ever was.

I used one of my parring knives  a gift from my father  to stab Erikson between the ribs, into the lungs. He gasped, sputtering, still riding the high of the afterglow, and I cradled his head in my lap as he died, singing sweet songs as his eyes grew glassy.

Erikson was a big, heavy weight in my bed, but if college taught me anything it was "waste not, want not." I had never slaughtered an animal before, and as I laid out the plastic tarp in my living room, I had never been so eager to learn something new.

I did the butchering naked, because my father said the first kill you did was better naked. Said it was better than sex, to which I always responded that sex was always boring at best  however, as I dismantled Erikson into something useful, completely drenched in his blood, I understood what father meant.

As Saturday night turned into Sunday morning, I had torn Erikson to the bones and my freezer was bursting with meat that promised weeks and weeks of meals. I boiled some of his bones for stock, even made the heart and lung into sausage, though the rest of the organs and bones were left for the other animals to take.

Some might consider this cannibalism, but I contend Erikson and I aren't really the same species  how could you explain my kind as anything other than a predator, camouflaged in his beauty? We don't call leopards cannibals for eating zebra just because they are both mammals.

My distressed lab mates, eating the pig stew I so graciously brought in during the search for Doctor Erikson? Oh, they definitely were. </TEXT>
