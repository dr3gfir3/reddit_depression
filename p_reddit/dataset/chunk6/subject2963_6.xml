	<TEXT> June 2015. I was late in finding out an amateur porn star I liked got fired because she was taking pictures at her job. She was a secretary in Swiss parliament. In response the majority of the videos she had were deleted from the internet. There used to be like 200 videos with her floating around now there are probably just 20-30 around. That is what got me started. [Here is a link](http://gawker.com/government-worker-suspended-for-tweeting-amateur-porn-s-1617054646) to that story for anyone that wants to read further on that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. They all blur together.
2. I don't have a favorite star. The videos as women blur together but I have large groups that I go to whenever I am in the mood for a certain race or type of performance. For example if I want to watch a hispanic woman there is Gina Valentina, Luna Star, and Goldie Rush. For asians Morgan Lee, Mila Jade, Marica Hase, Kalina Ryu, Saya Song, and Mia Li. Tattooed up women with a lot of plastic surgery I go with Romi Rain, Kleio Valentien, and Monique Alexander. There are other groups but I won't go into that.
3. WD external drives are pretty good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had Google Fiber which made downloading TBs very easy. With the amount of money I used porn discount sites and was able to get subscriptions for $5 or $10. The Brazzers, Bangbros, and Naughty America subs cost me 27.85 and I downloaded 7.59 TB of videos from those three sites. It was cheap in total I spent about $200 for all the videos. Which isn't much for me. </TEXT>
