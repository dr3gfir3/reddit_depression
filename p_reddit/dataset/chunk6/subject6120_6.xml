If I remember correctly, there was also something about the practice of older samurais taking on young protg that double-duty as their personal butt-boy.

One other thing I remember was about using condemned prisoners as practice dummies for young samurais in training on how to carryout a proper beheading.

	<DATE> 2016-08-02 07:06:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Anyway at the scene of the accident we see that the parents were robots. But in some frames they appear to be just regular dead bodies - suggesting maybe that part of what we see in the story is from the POV of the boy. 

Other hints that might help: 
The story opens with a superhero type character fighting robots and later on switches to the boy waking up - again suggesting that it (the robots, etc) was his dream or fantasy.

There's another superhero type that appears. He seems to be guarding the boy and is after the other superhero. Yet in some frames, we see them (the superheros) as just graffiti or graphics in a van --- again a suggestion that they might not be real.

Thanks for the help.

	<TEXT> That dividing line exists for us too. The unspoken rule was you shouldn't eat something you've given a name. 

So I had a pet dog growing up, but my father or his friends would not have seen it as food. 

The thing in the US (or the West) is that they treat pets like one of their children - which was weird for me in the beginning. People would be talking about what they did with someone over the weekend and it takes a minute or so before I realize they are talking about their cat.

I think I still see that line, but I don't think I'll cross it again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Breed dogs don't taste well. At least not where I grew up - this is because (supposedly) they get fed vitamins and such. Best ones are what we call "askal" (asong kalye/street dog)

So your Shih Tzu is safe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I get you. I used to eat dogs until I met a roommate's pitbull and noticed how much he (the dog) knew and remembered and preferred. It had a personality. A self.

Then I see these videos and articles of cows, pigs, whales, etc.   then the list of things I wouldn't think twice of as just "food" shrinks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh no, I wasn't defending Erap. I agree with everything you just said. 

I was just pointing out how much worse it's gotten with Duterte on the seat.

At least during Erap's time they were still trying to hide the corruption and there was a pretense of lawfulness. </TEXT>
