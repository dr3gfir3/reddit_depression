	<TEXT> I hardly think this qualifies as discrimination; it's basically a list of points t'help couples read one another's intentions during the early phases of dating. A man can go ahead and touch a woman, sure, in the same broadly acceptable manner as she'd touch him, but it probably wouldn't win him the same kind of affection as it would her.

This is really more of a social observation than anything else, and not one that can, or necessarily should, be changed too drastically. </TEXT>

I've have to agree with you with regard to the performance of touchless control, though; while it's not something I've used too extensively myself (t'the point where I gladly gave it up in favour of flashing CM 12.1 onto my device), I've heard it suggested that you should alter the language settings for Google Now if you'd like to improve performance.

	<TEXT>  White people are pretty. Blue eyes are pretty.

This was an oddly refreshing observation to read. Thank you for your compliment. :-)

 American men are polite. They don't touch me without my permission and don't stare at me like they can see through my clothes. That said, I went clubbing in Vegas once and got my butt grabbed so many times. So I guess the men here can be aggressive but only in certain places. In everyday life I'm not afraid of being assaulted and it's a huge relief.

I'm sorry about your unfortunate encounters in Vegas, but as a straight white male I really appreciate the sentiment that American men are polite - it's not something we're inclined to hear too often in the public discourse, in my own experience.

I'm not sure where it is you came from, but your English is absolutely impeccable. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-06-13 22:30:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all,

I currently have the opportunity to acquire a [Mid-2010 White Unibody Polycarbonate Macbook](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP584?locale=en_US) to upgrade and use as a desktop for a relatively decent price, but I have a couple of questions I'd like to get out of the way first.

1) The most important question concerns noise - I'm coming from a 2013 Macbook Air, which recently failed me, but that device was entirely silent. I'd intend to use the new computer as a desktop replacement, and though I won't be doing anything particularly computationally intense, it would be nice if I could leave it running overnight without having my sleep disturbed. How loud is the 2010 when operational? Would upgrading to an SSD (recommendations welcome, BTW) serve to reduce the noise by much?

2) Again, although I won't be doing anything too intense, how would the performance compare to my base model Air? Would the downgrade be noticeable, even if I went ahead and added an SSD?

3) I've heard conflicting reports on the amount of RAM the machine in question can utilize. At what point is it that I'm wasting my money?

4) I'm not entirely sold on the white polycarbonate look, and my budget would permit me to purchase some skins and keyboard covers. Can anybody recommend somewhere I could acquire these?

Many thanks in advance everybody, I'm looking forward to hopefully making a decision on the machine before the weekend is out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, you know that Battleworld has many versions of many characters, right? Like how there's a whole police force of Those, basically? There are already a few Cyclopses on Battleworld, and the Phoenix Force one (from Earth-616) was saved aboard Reed Richards' ship thing. Soi that's the "main" Cyke that we all know, the other versions are from different universes, brought together on Battleworld. </TEXT>

I've already started it twice, but found myself distracted after only a couple of chapters, which I enjoyed. I'm hoping to dive back in tomorrow when I've some time on my hands, so here's hoping the third try's the charm. </TEXT>
