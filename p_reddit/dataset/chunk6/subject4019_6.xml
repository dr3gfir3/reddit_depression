	<TEXT> Ser Aron knew this was going to come up, and being more of a moderator than a fighter, he tried to level with the man.

"Lord Jordayne," he bowed, his bald head glistening in the sun "The rumors are true, he's taken a Lyseni whore as a  wife. I urged him not to my lord, I told him to marry the girl and suck it up, but he would not listen. I will tell you now so no one else tells you, Lysandra is almost due. My lord, I will do anything to rectify this travesty immediately." </TEXT>

Daemon prayed to the gods that he won her favor, though, he was up against heavy competition, mainly Alyn Velaryon, and knowing that fathers liked to set up their daughters with men of nobler families, he knew that he would pick Alyn for her but a little part of his mind refused to believe the notion.

"Until then," he smiled. </TEXT>

Rest assured, there will be at least one Hellfyre boy to carry on the line, my lord, I promise. The Hellfyres can even have the first child from this union, whether it be a boy or girl, if a girl, they can have the first boy as well. I hope this is acceptable, my lord. I don't mean to offend at all, I am simply trying to find something that works for us both."

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It had been an arduous journey to Starfall, but a very beautiful one at that. The lowering sun looked absolutely gorgeous over the Red Mountains, like something out of the tales of old, and the best part? She was with Jonos. She couldn't believe he'd want to travel this far south. She warned him it would be hot, but he didn't seem to mind, he seemed like he liked the adventure, which was fine by her, because so did she. The castle was huge, she'd never seen anything like it. It was gran, it was regal, it was everything she wanted in a keep. In the back of her mind, she wondered if The Twins were as big as Starfall. 

"Rhealla Santagar and Jonos Frey to see Lady Clara," Rhaella said, looking up at the tall guard.

"Yes, we've been expecting you two. Excuse me while I go inform Lady Clara of your arrival," he said, going back into the huge castle while a much shorter guard took his place.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Lovely Lysandra (Part 2) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [m] Since I didn't post after I posted part 1, this'll just be a memory.

**Lys, 7th Month, 313**

Lysandra was absolutely beautiful, she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, definitely more beautiful than the Jordayne girl. Although, that made him feel quite guilty but he couldn't help it. She had to be the most beautiful girl in the world. She had pale blonde hair, dark purple eyes, and skin as white as snow with just the tiniest hint of a tan.

"So you must be Lovely Lysandra?" he asked.

"Yes," she said, taking a seat on the bed. "Come, sit with me."

"Okay," he gulped.

"You don't look like a Lyseni, where are you from?" she asked, staring at him intently.

"I'm from Dorne. The name's Aron Santagar, my lady," he smiled.

"Dorne, huh? I've been there once or twice, a nice place. Oh, I'm no lady, I'm just a common whore," she chuckled.

"None sense, you're absolutely beautiful," he smiled.

"Well thank you Aron, but truthfully, I'm just a common whore," she said lying back on the bed. 

"I can get you out of here," he whispered in her ear. "Under one condition."

"What's the condition?" she asked.

"That you marry me. I'm the heir to Spottswood and I need a wife and kid and since you are the most beautiful woman I've seen, I asked you. I was betrothed a while back, but I left. Please come back to Dorne with me," he said.

"I just met you," she said, sitting up. 

"It doesn't need to be a lavish ceremony. We can go to the septon and get married in secret. I will make sure you live a life of comfort, Lysandra," he said, looking her in the eye.

"Fine," she said.

"I'll inform my father that I've found a wife, and we'll be back in Spottswood by next month," he smiled.

He saw the look on her face and he could tell she wasn't sure. He knew because he made the same face when betrothed to the Jordayne girl. 

"If at any time, you don't want to stay, just leave. You are not my prisoner nor slave, you can leave whenever you like," he said, grabbing her hand.

 She told the brothel owner she quit and by the 8th month they were married, by the 9th they would be back in Spottswood.

 I am afraid that House Santagar cannot come, as we have got quite a lot of things going on. However, if my niece Visenya is still with Damian Ursus, she will most definitely come with him.

He knew this was a ballsy request because she was the heir. </TEXT>

 I'm quite glad you enjoyed the North and I hope you are well too, my prince! I do have my own leopard, his name is Aegon, named after your ancestor, Aegon the Conquer. I fear Prince Lucky that my father won't be available for some time, as he is coming north with my sister Ashara to marry her off to Manrel Stout. Rest assured, I will remind him once he comes to Bear Island.

 Your friend,

	<TEXT> Rhaegar and Rhaego finally arrived at Hellholt, after a month of travel, they were exhausted. The only thing that kept them going was meeting the beautiful Lady Tabitha, although she was a bit younger than them. When they arrived at Hellholt, they couldn't believe how unbearably hot it was. They were salt dornish so they were used to the heat, but the Dornish deserts were something else.

"We wish to see Lord Matthias Hellfyre. We are the Santagars," Rhaego said, moving his long Valyrian blonde hair from his face.

"I will go inform your arrival to Lord Matthias, immediately," the guard said, running off to go tell him of their arrival.

Ser Aron could plainly see the boy was being disrespectful, just as he did at Valena Toland's get together, he knew he had to nip this in the bud immediately. He gave Jaehaerys a stern look and walked ahead with Lord Tremond. *Oh great, now we're alone together.*

"Isn't the sea absolutely beautiful?" he said, not being sarcastic. This had to be the only non sarcastic sentence he'd ever spoken in his entire life, he was completely shocked. </TEXT>

To say that Jaehaerys didn't want to be at Salt Shore is an understatement. He was sure the girl was fine, but when his father told him to pack for Salt Shore, he was gambling with his brother Ser Lorence.

"Jaehaerys this is your brotrothed, Cassella Gargalen," Ser Aron said, motioning towards the girl.

	<TITLE> [Lore] The Lovely Lysandra (Part 1) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-27 22:54:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Aron had been in Lys for two months and he absolutely loved it! He loved the people, the food, the atmosphere, everything. But in the back of his mine, something was aching him "You're the heir Aron, you need to have children." He could hear his father's rough voice saying. He knew he had to had children, but knew he didn't want to have them with that Jordayne girl. She didn't seem interested and wasn't his type anyways. He thought he would try his luck at finding a wife in Lys, since all Lyseni women are absolutely beautiful, like his aunt Mysaria for example. It was said that in Lys, even the commoners had the typical Valyrian features: pale blonde hair, pale skin, and purple eyes. Aron didn't know who spread this rumor, but he found it to be true nonetheless. The city was filled with beautiful Valyrian looking women, he thought it had to have the most beautiful population in the world. *It won't be hard to find a woman here.* The city itself was admittedly filled with slaves, but other than that, it was quite beautiful, no wonder they called it Lys the Lovely. There was flowers of all kinds throughout the street, unlike in Dorne or Westeros in general. Everything seemed to be more colorful and lively, not as much as Tyrosh, but colorful and lively enough to see the difference.

As he walked down the cobblestone street, he saw a pillow house. Though they usually didn't do anything for him, he decided to go in, since everything in Lys was supposed to be lovely.

Boy was he wrong. The place reeked of booze and sweat and it was dark as a cave inside, he could barely see anything, he guessed that was a good thing. The sounds of moans and groans filled the pillow house and boy were they loud, nothing else could be heard besides the drunken murmurs of men telling the girls that they payed them enough and that they should shut and and do they're job. 

Gods, this place was hell, it was a terrible place, full of terrible people. As he was trying to leave, the brothel owner came up to him and said "Leaving so soon friend? You just go here?"

"There's nothing I like here," Aron said, pulling at the door once more.

"Nonsense, I'm sure we've something you like," the owner said, smiling as he put his hand on the door.

"Show me your most beautiful woman," he said, giving up on leaving.

"Oh, you're looking for Lovely Lysandra,"  the bald brothel owner smiled, gesturing to the back of the house.

	<TEXT> It was dawn by the time they were ready to leave for Goldgrass. The horses had been feed and Ashara was packed, as far as she was concerned, that meant that it was time to go. She hugged her mother, Mysaria, and her newborn sister, Rhaenyra wishing them the best of luck. She could already see that Rhaenyra was going to look exactly like her mother, she already had the purple eyes after all. She hugged them both again, and gave Rhaenyra a kiss on the head.

"Come, Lady Ashara, you're father is waiting for you," the old knight said.

"Goodbye mother," Ashara said, with tears welling up in her eyes. 

"Goodbye Ashara," Mysaria said, at the point of crying. "Good luck with the Stout boy, I hope he's a good man."

  With that, Ashara left in silence, not saying another word to her mother. 

"Don't be sad Ashara, they'll come up for the wedding after all," he smiled.

'I know, but I'll miss everyone so much," she said, thinking of all of the good times she's had at Spottswood.

"It's not forever," he said, helping her climb onto her horse.

"I know it isn't, but everything will be so different the next time I see them. Nymella's gone, Visenya is gods know where, and Quentyn is at the Citadel, how many of them are going to be at Spottswood the next time I come down?" she asked.

"Well, the boys, your mother, and your newborn sister will be there, and uncle Aron," he said, climbing onto his horse.

"I guess that's better than nothing," she shrugged.

  With that, they were off to Goldgrass. </TEXT>

 My son, Jaehaerys arrived home today from your get together, as he was recalling events to everyone, it eventually led me to believe that he was being quite rude and racist. From the rest of House Santagar, we apologize profusely and pray to the gods that this will not ruin the budding relationship between our two great houses. I would like to assure you Lady Valena, not all of us are as rude and racist as my son, I truthfully do not know where he gets it from. But please my lady, if you will, do not let one bad apple spoil the bunch.

 Your friend,

	<TEXT> There was nothing wrong with Lady Jordayne, except that she was a woman of course. Aron knew that he wouldn't be able to do it, he wouldn't be able to marry and have kids with a woman, but he wanted children so badly. As he paced the halls of Spottswood, what if he ran away? What if he ran away where no one would find him? *Yes, it's perfect! I'm sorry girl.* He rode to Sunspear immediately and went to the docks.

"One ship to Lys," he said, rushed.

"We don't have any ships going to Lys," the old harbormaster said, scratching his white beard.

A moment later Aron pulled out a small velvet sack of coins and laid it on the harbormaster's desk. The old man looked at him perplexed, got up, and left. A moment later he came back with a captain. He was a plump man, looked mid forties with balding grey hair and he reeked of fish.

"This here is the captain who'll take you to Lys," the old man said, annoyed that he had to do actual work.

"Let's go," the plump captain said, licking grease off of his fingers.

*Ugh, this guy is disgusting, well, at least he isn't taking me far.*

The ship was a piece of junk. It was a small merchant ship that looked like it hadn't been taken good care of in at least a decade. Aron was hesitant of going on it, truth be told, but he just thought of spending the rest of his life with the Jordayne girl, and that made him immediately jump on.

Moments later he was sailing away from Dorne, the only home he had ever known. Back there, he was the heir of House Santagar, here, he was truthfully no one. It scared him to death to go to Lys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Lord Lucerys Velaryon,

 I write to you today, my lord, asking if you would be interested in a betrothal for your daughter Della. My grandson, Selwyn, is seeking betrothal as well and I believe the two of them would make a great match. He is currently living with Princess Arianne and Serenei in King's Landing. If you are interested, my lord, I will send word to Selwyn informing him to go to Driftmark immediately.

 Yours Truly,

 Ser Aron Santagar, Knight of Spottswood

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Aron Santagar, the heir of Spottswood, had been riding for The Tor now for a day and a half. *Gods, is this sand unbearable.* He'd been called to The Tor by Lord Regent Auro Jordayne, however the Lord Regent did not give a reason for his call. Whatever it was, Aron hoped it wasn't a proposal. His father, Ser Aron had tried to set him up with a Stormlander about a decade back, but that didn't work. He refused and the marriage never took place. Aron often wondered what became of the Stormlander girl. *Did she mother a great lord? Did she marry a commoner or an heir?* Though he tried not to think of her often, as it caused him to feel a sort of guilt.

The Tor was absolutely beautiful when Aron got there. It had to be one of the nicest castles he'd ever seen in his opinion. Near the front gate, there were two huge guards, as big as the Red Mountains they were. 

"State your business," the guard on the left said, getting in front of the door.

"I wish to speak to Lord Regent Auro Jordayne. He's called me here. I am Aron Santagar, heir to Spottswood," Aron said, pumping out his chest. For some reason, knowing he was the heir made him feel quite well.

A moment later, the guard went into the castle to get Auro Jordayne. </TEXT>

She's always tells other people that I've no job and that I've been out of hs for two years and haven't gone to college yet, am not doing anything with my life, am like my dad, etc. 1) I don't have a job because one, it's difficult to get a job when you have no qualifications and two, I CAN'T FUCKING DRIVE. How the fuck are you supposed to get a job when you can't drive!?! I don't want to force people to drive me like my dad did because that causes resentment. Also, how am I supposed to go to college? I've no money and don't know what to study, and I'm definitely not falling in that debt trap.
2) I'm not doing anything with my life because I don't know what to do damn! Plus do you know how fucking hard it is to do ANYTHING with fucking depression?! DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE!
3) This one is the worst one imaginable. My dad is a conman, a manipulator, a liar, a thief, and an abuser. THIS IS A MAN, WHO RECENTLY TRIED TO FAKE HIS DEATH BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT AND WHO ALMOST PUSHED HER OUT OF A WINDOW and she says I'm like him because I don't do anything. You know, it's hard as hell to do anything if you got depression, and you ain't helping! I even tried to call her out on this when she last told me I was like him, I said "do I hit you?" She didn't say a word. I love her, but damn, she needs to shut the fuck up. So, what do I do now? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nymella was still in shock that she was married to Baelor Hightower, *I married a Hightower of Oldtown*

"Are you ok, Nymella?" Quentyn asked, knocking her out of her trance.

"Yes, father, I'm fine," she smiled.

"Then cheer up darling, you just got married after all! It's going to be wonderful living in Oldtown," Oberyn smiled, his laugh lines becoming more apparent.

"I know it will be father, I am just nervous that's all. What if Lord Humfrey and Lady Alaena don't approve of me?"

"Nonesense, you're a a smart girl and quite beautiful, I might add, why wouldn't they?"

"You saw the way everyone was at me. They couldn't believe that Baelor, a Hightower, was marrying a me, a lady from a minor Dornish house."

"Well then, you've got to prove to them that that's not all you are. Did you marry above yourself, absolutely you did, Nymella but don't let the whispers of people in the sept control how you live the rest of your life. I'm sure, once they get to know you, they'll love you almost as much as I do," he said, giving her a hug. "I'm afraid I must be going, I've got to get back to Spottswood immediately and then it's on to King's Landing."

"Why are you going there?" she asked.

"Apparently, your sister Visenya said that Prince Lucky could have a leopard and that I would stay down there for a while and train it. I guess it's worth it, now that we've high favor with the little prince," he chuckled.

"Be safe, father," she with tears building up in her eyes.

She realized, that after he father left, she would have no one in Oldtown that she knew well; all of the other Santagars were on their way home.

"Be safe too, Nymella," he smiled again.

And with that, he got into the carriage, and he was gone. *Let's hope I make a few friends here, and fast.* </TEXT>
