	<TEXT> This is the most recent example, but not the first time this "artist" has done this. 

http://imgur.com/UaNpUpC

She has done this many times before, and has blocked people who say she is a fraud. I don't know if there is any legal recourse the original artist can take, but I'm not an expert in this. Please support the original artist and help spread the word.

	<TEXT> Reading the first link you posted, I found this argument very dubious:
Technology has advanced to the point that photographs of real children being abused can
be manipulated into cartoons or other depictions. Possession of these images is not caught
under existing legislation because they do not appear to be photographs, nor can the police
forfeit them and take them out of circulation. But nevertheless they are often graphic and
explicit depictions of the sexual abuse of children. 

It sounds like they are saying that cartoons can be derived from modified real images, which to me just sounds utterly ridiculous

	<TEXT> I've played fighting games casually for a long time, but never got particularly good at them.  Whether it be SF4, UMVC3, or KOF13, I always get my butt handed to me online. I'm looking to play a more modern fighting game now, and guilty gear is by far the most impressive current generation game.  I love the idea of the roman cancel system and the graphics are absolutely stunning.  However, it seems to have a steep learning curve, and I unfortunately do not have as much time any more to commit.  Is it worth buying this game if I don't have the time to train consistently?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the void ray reversion. I think prismatic beams in WoL was one of the most interesting game mechanics, and it's sad it was replaced with something as simple as "press button, lazers stronger!" If protoss players are concerned with the damage output, they could add an upgrade that increases the void ray chargeup speed by like 30% or something.  Seems perfectly reasonable with the proper tweaking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are couple ways to address burrowfestors without outright reverting:

1. Greatly reduce vision while burrowed.  Zerg players would need to utilize spotters to optimally land fungals, or unburrow temporarily for better vision.  

2. Reduce movement speed even more while burrowed. This is the simpler nerf, as infestors right now may be too mobile even when burrowed.   

Either of these would be more interesting IMO than reverting the changes.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's sounds like you actually want them to revert all the buffs. Cuz then you could gloat like "I told you! I called it!"  Look, the buffs that are fair will remain in the game, the buffs that are OP will be reverted.  That's how balancing works, deal with it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a huge hyperbole if not an outright lie. I still see hydralisks in most games against zerg. Hydralisks are better now than at the beginning of LOTV, and zerg players are only complaining because they have been spoiled by the clearly OP range buff.  Hydras were already entering the meta before the buff, and now they are faster on creep on top of that.  Please stop spreading misinformation </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very reasonable changes.  10 mineral interceptors is still cheap, and +5 health banelings are still strong.  Plus Zerg got to keep their amazing burrowfestors, so they really have nothing to complain about.  

Now let's do something about cyclone turret tracking! </TEXT>
