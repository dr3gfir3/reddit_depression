	<TEXT> I tried to put mine back in a year   a half after I stopped wearing it; it was uncomfortable,  but it fit,   2 days later it felt fine.

A lot of it depends on what point you stopped wearing it -I only had to wear mine every other night when I stopped  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lost my virginity by rape when I was 14.  I think under different conditions it would have been LESS traumatic,  but it would still be traumatizing. 
It took me almost 20 years to deal with it   come to terms with what it,   the fallout from it did to me.
People didn't believe me, I didn't fully understand what had happened,    it did nothing to help my already-low self-esteem.  I spiraled downwards, having sex with guys who didn't care about me as a way to make myself feel wanted.   It didn't work.  For most of my life, sex had no intimacy for me, it was just another activity that I did with my SO, like bowling or watching a movie.

I don't know how to answer your question,  but I hope this gives you some insight.   If you have any questions,  feel free to ask, I'm surprisingly comfortable talking about this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My husband   I both live off his salary (he makes just above minimum wage),   we live quite comfortably.  The most important thing is to not have any debts.
Learning to fix things   cook instead of just eating convenience foods also helps immensely 

You may have to ask yourself if a car is a necessity or a luxury.  If you have decent public transit, that can be cheaper,   might be worth looking into.
