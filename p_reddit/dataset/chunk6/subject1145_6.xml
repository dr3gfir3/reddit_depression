	<TEXT> I'm in the minority because a lot of people here bootleg and haven't made a movie; although, of course, I'm guilty of bootlegging too....but after I learned how hard it is to make a movie, I just couldn't bring myself to bootleg any of them anymore. We're in a time where we yearn for innovation in entertainment but don't want to spend anything on it. Bootlegging a movie is like saying, "I like all the hard work you did, but I'm not going to pay you for any of it."  

Imagine if that line was used for your job. How would you feel? Would you want to work anymore? You don't just walk into an an art museum and take a painting, right? That's what you're doing when you bootleg a movie; you're walking into an art show and stealing a thousand paintings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is HIIT in running/walking form.  

Here's one of the best HIIT full body workouts ever: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEz0VGxsiqc  

I do the above workout before a heavy lift day, but it works very well in helping you lose weight! The following link is an example of one of my favorite DVDs called 10 minute solutions Hight Intensity Interval Training: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKWEz5svoTg  

As you can see HIIT is good for cardio as well as strength training! I recommend strength training because it will help with your cardio as well. So during the rest periods (1 minute of workout; 30 second rest) I'll train my vocals so I won't be out of breath when I call out to the crowd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The brief period I trained was at the tail end of my Marine Corps career, so I was in pretty good shape.  

Since the area I live is closer to luchadore territory we trained in the style. After running nearly 10 miles before going to practice, I was gassed when it finished. The next morning I couldn't get out of my bed.  

And it was worth every fucking minute of it! </TEXT>

Collin: (armlocked with Wayne, both are skipping) We're going to your mother's house, your mother's house, you mother's house.  

Wayne: No we're not. It's YOUR mother's house.  

Collin: I'd rather it not be my mother's house. Let's have it be Drew's mother's house!  

Drew: No fucking way.  

Wayne: Then it's not a mother's house. How about a house of cards?  

Collin: Nope. That's stupid. You're an idiot.

Mankind: You're right. I made it up.  

Bossman: I only play a jail warden on tv. In actual real life I play a WWF Superstar.  

Mankind: That's great, Bossman. That reminds me of the time in 1998 when I had one of my best matches ever with Shawn Michaels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well this got me motivated! I didn't use it, but a technique like it (that I've been developing myself).  

I get my WANTS in order. I WANT to write a book. I WANT to film a sequel to my super-hero movie. I WANT to have something to eat tonight.  

Then I break the WANTS down in to HAVE TOs. I HAVE TO buy some fucking food if I want to eat. I HAVE TO get permits for filming in the city. I HAVE TO set aside some fucking time to write.  

I thought of this method after learning to play songs on the guitar. I WANT to play a song on the guitar; I HAVE TO learn what chords are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The worst thing someone in a professional wrestling ring can do is to no-sell their opponent verbally. Mankind writes in one of his first two books about how Bossman was a great heel because he didn't instantly deny being on the tea cups at Disneyland, he went with it, made a joke that defamed him but not the opponent saying the zinger. Foley built people up in his promos. He made it a match worth seeing, his character always seemed to be overcoming the odds (through dialogue, not action). Imagine if Undertaker did the throat cut and Mankind did spooky fingers; imagine what a shit story that would be. He'd of probably thrown Mankind into the audience instead of the announcer's table. </TEXT>

He'll hold it to Steph's head and Steph will make a puddle around her. Roman pulls the trigger and "Beeeleee Dat!" will come out on a flag. Samoa Joe will drive a bulldozer to the arena and shoot out coconuts at Steph, burying her in coconuts. The Usos will then stuff Stephanie in the back of a limo and drive MONSTER Trucks into the limo until Steph is presumed dead.  

Then she comes back as The Undertaker's niece. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their "We came to fight" look really puts me in a good mood. Like, finally! Someone who's dressed to kick some ass, get a pay check and go home. If they get titles, cool, if the crowd cheers, cool, but their main focus is to beat people up. I also like their more methodical style, it really tells a good story in the ring (hopefully that story is: We're the Usos and we just kicked your ass). </TEXT>

I freaking love heel Usos! If you watch any of the bts shows like UpUpDownDown then you can see how the heel Usos are exaggerations of their real selves. I also think they should be billed as hailing from "The Wrong Side of the Island" but that's racist. </TEXT>

Maybe have Reigns vs Goldberg and Reigns wins. I like the thickness of the match; but as with everything WWE does nowadays it feels like there's something missing. That hidden stair in the Escher sketch you didn't see the first few times; that subtle foreshadowing in a drama that most people only pick up on after the third viewing; that mystique of storytelling where you don't know what's going to happen next. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol! I love reddit xD "I don't agree with you, downvote"   

I think a stable with Baron Corbin and the Usos would be pretty cool! Not that Smackdown needs stables; but the idea of these three together really makes me smile!  

Am I the only one who really likes the Usos' new gimmick? I mean they're pretty much the guys from the "Wrong side of the Island" ...though I think some creativeness should be brought into their future names in order to distinguish them. Jimmy could be Kanaloa and Jey could be Tua Brown ...and they could start calling people "Pohos"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've cut my own hair; didn't like the way it turned out and stopped cutting my own hair. I'm not sure if I'd enjoy life without my hands since I type a lot. I'm jack hammered myself in the foot with steel toe boots on and kind of liked it. I didn't know I'd like jackhammering my foot until I did it.  

Yes I do agree that prejudice and racism are different. But what happens when prejudice is the result of race? I'm using a more vernacular term of racism. Not the inferior/superior definition; but it's more the idea that a certain race acts a certain way. It's a blanket statement that's used to group people together.  

I think my biggest problem that want to date a certain race (and I understand why they do; no one should have to date someone they don't want to) is that the person saying "I only date Gubernatorial Candidates" is so naive and closed off to the world that they're pigeon-holing an entire race of people. And that's how they're racist. I hope I've articulated my (personal) problems with most people who think this way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So here's where racism and prejudice blur:

I message a woman who says she only likes black guys (no problem, I'm mixed). She messages me back saying I'm not black, more like coffee.  

The prejudice part is to tell me I'm not black because of my skin color. The racist part is to judge someone based on their skin color.  

My soon to be downvoted opinion is that if you want to date a specific race then you're racist no matter what. If you're that closed minded that you think a specific race of people are all the same then I think my world is better off without someone so disgusting in it.

	<TEXT> The problem with Roman isn't that he's a bad worker or untalented at all. He's a fun performer and has natural charisma. The problem with Roman is 1. He's not good at pumping out perfectly polished promos, meaning if he were to just be himself with guided bullet points then he'd be much better on the Mic. 2. He's basically the corporate champion (see The Rock as corporate champion) without being booked as a heel and 3. He's just too big to be booked as an underdog. If they booked him properly, the Strowman match was great, but they have to make guys then break them, World Breaker Roman Reigns would be awesome, he just comes out, breaks someone's winning streak, then goes back and polishes the side plates of his belt, I think (if done right, which it won't be) Roman beating Brock will push Reigns into a respectable (by IWC) position.  

The story is that Reigns might have beaten Brock at Mania, if Rollins didn't cash in. We still need to see who's the stronger of the two big guys! This is this generation's version of Hogan vs Warrior. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's how I lived off of $15 USD/wk:  

Found the discount grocery store; this place sells Annie's snack foods for about 2 bucks or less; their produce isn't quality but it gets the trick done. Have a pantry staple of: Salt, Pepper, Olive Oil, and Balsamic Vinegar.  

For the week buy: ($4) One pack of greens, ($1) 2 cucumbers, ($2) One pack of carrots, ($2) One pack of onions, ($1) One loaf of bread, ($3) Two jars of peanut butter  

Create a salad for yourself, dress it with salt/pepper/oil and the secret is to use a lot of vinegar. Store the salad in the fridge. Take bites from the salad throughout the day (If you're doing the keating diet, which I recommend for people with lower incomes, then take a few bites every hour during your allotted meal time.) Drink LOTS of water and if you get the hunger pains then have a peanut butter sandwich to satisfy yourself.  

If you don't like peanut butter then you can curb the hunger (although slightly more expensive) with a block of cheese and cheap tortillas. </TEXT>
