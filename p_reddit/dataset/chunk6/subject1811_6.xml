	<TEXT> My first impression, even before reading, was that the paragraphs were way to long. This is coming from someone who likes to read and is used to longer paragraphs. But I feel that long paragraphs make readers bored and skip the center of paragraph.

When actually started reading the paragraph I felt it flowed nicely and was very descriptive. Going back to my last point, you could separate the 1st paragraph starting at *In the gloom from the starless night...*

The next two paragraphs were pretty good, although you used some cliche words such as "he could feel his heartbeat pounding" and "Cold sweat". This is just my personal preference that cliche words should be limited, and most people don't care or even notice. So, honestly, this is just my commentary on it.

I'm going to bunch the next few paragraphs together and say that I am pretty confused on what exactly is going on. I assume (most definitely) that you just haven't gotten to the point in the story where they are explained.

And honestly the ending felt a bit rushed. I'm not sure why but the "keeping your soul" part just didn't flow right. It was too abrupt. And finally, the climax and resolution was a little lackluster. This combines with the ending feeling a little rushed to make a average ending; not an amazing one.

I'm sorry if this is a bit short, but your story was well written and the only *major* flaw to me was the ending.

~~Good luck, in the rest of your writing.~~ Damn, I just looked up to your description and saw the "part 2" part. Well, good luck in writing the next part of story! </TEXT>
