	<TEXT> You're cute in the second pic with the sign. If I did online dating I'd ignore underwear man and go for you instead. I'm kinda hot but taken :p

Ps. Underwear model more likely to suck in bed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok I'll try upgrading the engine first. I'm not looking to kick ass right away but not doing any damage is embarassing. I have a life outside game but I still feel a sense of failure, as though I'm overlooking the obvious --and that bugs me lol  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm very grateful for your reply. I'm going to try again tonight and ensure that I am following through. I was also unaware that you have to lead blaster bolts to the ship.

I find the upgrades difficult to understand. The descriptions presuppose prior knowledge, unlike my own ship's upgrades. 

I applied 3 or 4 upgrades and then gave up when I noticed I was still doing no damage. It's bizarre because I do space missions way above my own level.

Anyway, I'll give it another go but with the time commitment required to learn what all the armor and weapons do, I'd have to stop playing my non-GSF game.

I really do appreciate your awesome reply.

	<TEXT> Apologies, internet guy. I should have cited the academic journal I got this from but I thought I was posting on reddit.

His approval ratings were based on 1. Over a decade of perseverance and 2. Hatred for the previous administration/bad economy. And yes, his propaganda was censored. So lots of people had no clue what he was capable of. 

Censorship is always wrong. And if you defend free speech you have to defend it for the views you hate most.
