	<TEXT> Being trans isn't a mental illness. There's a physical difference in the brain; it reflects the structures of the sex of the gender they identify as.

Left untreated, that difference between body and brain can (and often does) cause dysphoria, which is a mental illness, but fortunately we have the ability to alter the body to match the brain and alleviate that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That is the plaintiff's filing, putting their own spin on things.

This is a sworn statement. If that's false, Minton can be tried for perjury.

The normal remedy for behavioral health conditions are, therapy and medications, not drastic, irreversible surgeries, 

Usually, yes. But being trans is not a purely psychological condition; there's no way to make the brain match the body but there is a way to make the body match the brain.

[Zhou et al 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289)

that don't turn a woman into a man in any case.

Minton already is a man. Between how his brain has always been, and how his body is now, he's a man.

LOL!! "phalloplasty" - why don't you tell our readers what that is in plain english?

Phalloplasty: surgical creation of a penis. You've got a bizarre sense of humor if that's somehow funny.

And if the Minton didn't get the phalloplasty on time, then what? Nothing

Not correct. Further denying affirming care would needlessly aggravate his dysphoria.

a woman would be spared permanent mutilation for a few more days or weeks.

Not a woman, not mutilation.

They refused to perform one procedure which is independent of being trans. 

That's not true; Dawson was able to perform a hysterectomy at that hospital on the same day. She basically had to abuse the emergency admission process at a different hospital to get Minton treated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not so much that there's some massive immediate jump in cancer risk, but over time that risk adds up. Some birth control carries similar risks if you use it from puberty to menopause. 

As for puberty blockers, they were developed some time ago to treat early puberty. They do carry some slight risk that once you go off them puberty won't start naturally, but hormone therapy can restart it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1.. From the filing:

Dr. Dawson regularly performs hysterectomies at MSJMC, and in fact she had another
hysterectomy scheduled immediately following Mr. Mintons scheduled procedure. 

According to Mr. Ivie, MSJMC would not allow the hysterectomy to proceed because it was scheduled as part of a course of treatment for gender dysphoria, as opposed to any other medical
diagnosis. 

2.. Mental health is no different from any other sort of health. Also, most doctors do not disagree. Again from the filing: 

The widely accepted standards of care for treating gender dysphoria are published by the
World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). The WPATH Standards of Care
have been recognized as the authoritative standards of care by leading medical organizations, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, and federal courts.

3.. Time was particularly crucial in this particular case because phalloplasty had already been scheduled, but due to complications with insurance the hysterectomy couldn't be booked until after the date for phalloplasty had been set. And there has to be a three month gap between those procedures.

4.. Freedom of religion does not give free license for discrimination. I couldn't very well start a hospital and just flat out refuse to treat gay people on the basis of my religion. I encourage you to read the [filing](https://www.aclunc.org/docs/20170419-minton_complaint.pdf), particularly the First Cause of Action on pages 7 and 8. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually read that article as well, but it gets a lot of key facts just flat out wrong.

1. The hospital does regularly provide hysterectomies. They specifically said that they refused because Minton is trans.

2. The physician in charge of the procedure, following well-accepted standards, says the procedure is *not* elective.

3. Minton was only able to receive the procedure in a timely fashion because Dr. Dawson sort of abused the emergency admissions at another hospital where she worked.

4. The ACLU isn't suing because of how Minton feels, which would be a harassment (?) suit, but because he was discriminated against, a Title VII suit.

Overall this is a very misleading article by one of Reason's most blatantly partisan contributors.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By August 2016, Mr. Minton and his treating physicians had a plan for a series of
medical procedures that would result in a phalloplasty, or the surgical creation of a penis.9
 The first of
these planned steps was a complete hysterectomy, or removal of his uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.
**In Mr. Mintons case, hysterectomy was medically necessary care to treat his diagnosis of gender
dysphoria. This was the professional opinion of Mr. Mintons hysterectomy surgeon and two mental
health professionals who counseled Mr. Minton during his transition.** </TEXT>

2. From the filing, since I have it right here already:

 13.. The widely accepted standards of care for treating gender dysphoria are published by the
World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). **The WPATH Standards of Care
have been recognized as the authoritative standards of care by leading medical organizations, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, and federal courts.**

 14.. Under the WPATH standards, **treatment for gender dysphoria may require medical steps
to affirm ones gender identity** and help an individual transition from living as one gender to another.
This treatment, often referred to as transition-related care, may include hormone therapy, surgery
(sometimes called sex reassignment surgery or gender affirming surgery), and other medical services that align individuals bodies with their gender identities. The exact medical treatment varies
based on the individualized needs of the person.  </TEXT>

Edit: I just finished emailing them all telling them that some person on Reddit pointed out that dysporia actually isn't serious and doesn't require treatment. They were skeptical since they have thousands of experts in the field who have said otherwise, but eventually I won them over so you can expect that to be fixed in their next publications. </TEXT>

Edit: Unruh Civil Rights Act; they aren't even going as high as Title VII in this case. I was thinking of a similar suit in Wisconsin that is using Title VII. </TEXT>

That's correct. A young child doesn't get anything more than puberty blockers starting around 8 or 9, which are reversible. Hormone therapy doesn't start until at least 16.

Far from it. Puberty blockers are entirely renversable. Also I'm not sure I believe that 80% number, not unless it's for a very broad definition of dysphoria. While many children do go through brief phases where they act more boyish or girly, that's not the same as insisting that they feel like a boy or a girl. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't believe transsexuality is much of a political issue, outside of North Carolina.

It would be nice if that were true, but there are definitely places where it's political. Texas saw HB2 and really liked it. Many states don't have any anti-discrimination laws on the books regarding trans people, and not because they forgot. Some places put huge hurdles in front of people who try to change their ID or birth certificate.

it should be addressed by the medical professionals on an individual basis.

Again, how nice that would be. Unfortunately you have places where that process is intervened. Wisconsin, for instance, specifically prohibits any insurance coverage for transition for state employees, even though the same treatments may be covered for non-transition purposes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a finicky idea to explain and I'm not very good at it. Gender is how you feel about your own sex. Usually it lines up with your body because usually your brain lines up with your body. There's definitely a social aspect to it too though, because we're social animals and like it or not what people say about us and how they treat us is very important to our self image. If we think that only the sex assigned at birth can be correct and must define us because that's what we're told, then that's hard conditioning to break. There's some element of it therefore that's biological, and some that's social. 

The choice argument of it is more complicated (this isn't really my area of expertise), but it's similar to sexuality. If some guy really wanted to for some reason, he could choose to have sex with dudes even though he's straight, and eventually cultivate taste and come to like it. But if he chose to do that, was he really straight in the first place? By the same logic, if a guy chooses to live as a girl and eventually becomes comfortable with it, was that a choice or was it a discovery? It gets really murky and self-referential at a certain point, and I'm no rocket philosopher. </TEXT>

Being trans isn't a mental illness, but failure to get proper treatment can lead to or aggravate a very serious mental illness.

Now that that's out of the way: children don't undergo surgery or hormone treatments. The most they get is puberty blockers around 8 or 9 (which is reversible if need be), and then HRT from around 16 at the earliest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it's not something that you choose. But there definitely is evidence that gender identity has social influences. The ancient Greeks recognized more than two genders, much of Asia today still does. 

Plus it's not like the brain is binary, *strictly* male XOR female. Nothing is that clear-cut. Some are more male, some are more female. But social pressure definitely has some influence; people suppress their identities if they're made to believe it's wrong somehow, and the same thing sort of goes for people who might fall somewhere between male and female but don't have a way of expressing that and just sort of go to one end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, technically yes. That's kinda how gender works. Realistically, gender identity develops as early as three, but trans people usually know that something is off from a very early age even if they don't know how to express that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most places the driver is basically always at fault if they hit someone, but you can still be cited for jaywalking and that means insurance might not pay out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Testing is already a pretty standard practice and it's not something I'm terribly bothered by; that's part of ensuring people don't cheat. It's not a perfect process because sometimes there are medical necessities that will throw up red flags, but that's why things like Safe Harbor exist (and also it's not perfect because it doesn't have a 100% detection rate).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My issue is with the people who claim that they're so interested in making sure sports are fair, but then never show up in those other threads about people on steroids. And my really big issue is with people who use that "concern" as a cover when they're called out for being hateful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, HRT (which isn't testosterone) is okay within certain benchmarks. As are many controlled substances when they're under Safe Harbor policy (or maybe it has a different name now). There are plenty of people, not just trans, who have a medical requirement for something that would normally be banned. So long as that's disclosed and tested for, and they meet certain benchmark requirements, they're eligible to compete. </TEXT>
