The only other places I can find stories on this are Breitbart and Washington Times. No credible journalistic sources are reporting it. This is probably just a book with nothing to substantiate it, made for the drama to get gullible Clinton haters to buy it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll respect the rich and their success as soon as inheritance is abolished, since this is the only way to actually have any sort of level playing field or equal opportunity. Once I know it's not just money derived from the fortunes of their relatives, then maybe I'll see it as fair. And even then we would need to push for more worker control over their own workplace. </TEXT>
