	<TEXT> I guess, I think killing someone with polonium is clearly going to be tied to him.  No way that kind of OP went down without Putin's go ahead. Boris Nemsetov getting killed in site of the kremlin and no one seems to know how it went down also seems pretty clearly Putins call. Anna Politkovskaya is harder to tie to Putin and less clearly him... basically putin could do things subtly but he has chosen not too. He wants it to be tied to him and his calling the shots.  Maybe when it comes to murdering reporters he wants some extra ambiguity and distance because that looks worse than murdering opposition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk, I don't think it was his choice of high road that did it, it was bungling his campaign often and early. 

First question he was asked to as about his brothers presidency.... not really unexpected and he totally bungled it. 

He never seemed to be really that into it, and that why trumps low energy moniker stuck. 

Trump is a professional school yard bully. Has been all his life. And he is really good and finding people's weakness, exposing it and making it stick... regardless of the substance and merit of that person. Low energy Jeb, crooked Hilary, it stuck because it played to what people were seeing. bush bumbling his campaign. 

Comie shitting on the hatch act and the near decade long republican hit job making Hilary look less than honest, as well as the Hilary campaigns way of handling of scandal did not help and the crooked moniker landed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Long term toxicity is incredibly difficult to determine especially by the person exposed because the changes are subtle and progressive and can be chalked up to life changes and aging... it's really hard to know what someone might have been. Throw in a developing brain and that is even more complex. 

Small incremental change can add up over years of use and also because of social constructs impairment in late adolescence really stratified future opportunities, earning potential, and other socioeconomic factors. So even a minor temporary impairment can have life long effects (ironically for the same reason that criminalizes weed and charges against youth, particularly minority youth had lifelong impacts on outcomes).

Adding regular habitual use of psychoactive substances to the developing brain just seems like a bad idea. </TEXT>

It's also robust in that you still walk and talk and function but that does not mean that higher cognitive function, mood disorders, anxiety levels are not affected and in modern life where cognitive performance, delayed gratification, stress management are vital to financial security, career gratification, well being etc, etc, small subtle changes can have significant social and economic costs to the user... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your brain is still forming, you probably will have some acute effects but it's hard to know long term effects like anxiety, attention, subtle changes in cognitive function. Weed is probably less harmful than most drugs but it would not be a stretch to see it as more harmful in adolescents. 

Take lead for instance... lead poisoining in a child leads to life long cognitive deficit and impairment dose dependent. In adults there is acute toxicity, it's not good but much fewer long term neurological effects. 

Also chronic use of some drugs reprograms your brain. For instance long term use of heroin/opiates makes you hyper sensitized to pain, so people who use it for pain (physical and probably mental) chronically in addition to addiction and dependence also when off of it are less capable of dealing with their pain than before. 

Also, one might wonder if instead of developing healthy coping skills, exercise, mediation, mindfulness, adequate sleep, regular schedule, healthy relationships, work life balance, hobbies outside interests, etc... adolescents are substituting weed and therefore never form the coping skills and life skills needed to function well as an adult.

Also if you know it's bad but still do it you might see how you Le impulse control is in the rest of your life... if it's not good that's a problem. Training yourself for delayed gratification and impulse control and coping skills is the most valuable skill for thto rest of your life. Being informed won't fix that btw, it's about learning to deal with shit in a healthy way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He also planned to murder almost 90% of Slavs and eastern europeans from Poland to the urals... he felt more strongly about the Jews and disabled so much so he undertook the mass murder before and then even during the war despite needing the resources elsewhere. Hitler felt that the Jews were a threat to German security and society so bad to be exterminated immediately... the Slavs could wait until after the war. 

That is what people forget when comparing Hitler to Mao or Stalin. Sure both mao and stalin where murders on a large scale... Hitler aspired to murder on an unprecedented level. Mao and Stalin murdered for authoritarian and ideological reasons and Stalin was anti Semitic, but they did not murder people because they felt entire ethnicities should not exist. For Eastern Europeans, WWII was quite literally a life and death struggle.  </TEXT>

How are you going to tax people who do not have legal standing here? 

Or are you going to tax all wire transfers to Mexico? Not even sure that's legal but that would be hugely destabilizing and oddly punitive... many legal immigrants send money too. 

Why is it fair for legal immigrants and US citizens to be taxed for money they choose to send their family and friends in Mexico? 

How are you even going to identify remitiances specially? What is to stop someone from setting up a shell corporation in Mexico and then treat the remittances as payment for some nominal service? 

And what about other countries with illegals like china, or even migrants form Central American and South American countries?  </TEXT>

We know giving women control over reproduction is one of the most effective ways to reduce poverty, improve education and literacy, and helps the economy. And no birth control is prefect. Furthermore, everytime policy disregards that we are human and have human needs and desires it fails because people are evolved to need and want intimacy and sexual relations but likely with modern medicine we don't have 14 children per family as a result... </TEXT>

B) How? Mexico doesn't have the billions to spare and if they did why would they? What leverage does trump have that won't hurt America?  Best part is no one knows how he even plans to do this.

C) It's a long time until next election time... and I would not venture a guess as to the dynamics of that election... but since truth was not very important in this election and continues to be a weak spot with the trump administration, would not bank them having to do anything.

	<TEXT> 1) good journalism, somehow we need to unite or penetrate across multiple tiers of the current fragmented media market.

2) get better at explaining complex platforms to voters and making them relevant to those voters.

3) voters need to start accepting the truth, any policy will have losers  and winners, you can't do everything for everyone. Truth and bad news have been absent from US politics. Coal is not coming back. Manufacturing jobs are going to get automated if they come back. Unskilled, entry level jobs are not going to command the salaries they did in the 50s. People will lose with globalization but we also can't stop it.

4) corollary to 3. With progress there are losers and winners. Unlike in the 90s and 00s where losers of globalization were overlooked, people who get marginalized need programs to help mitigate their suffering. Retraining, education opportunities, investment into those areas, increased minimum wage so if they do end up in entry level service work they can live with some dignity, healthcare etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I think it's complicated in that science and economics are tools... when it comes to policy, these are tools that can help achieve certain goals but are indifferent to the goals set. 

It is for as a society and political parties who are theoretically representative of society, to pick those goals, and then use science and economics to optimize the appropriate parameters... within the framework of government and law (in the US the framework of the constitution and according to principles of humanism and empiricism laid out in the Declaration of Independence and other works laid out by our founding fathers). 

 The problem and disconnect you see with parties is they say one thing and then cherry pick data to support that argument and then the results don't help those that they were supposed to help and hurt others while benefiting a third party...

The problem there is multi-factered but at the end of the day these parties, while ideological, are not stupid and simply tell the electorate one thing, manipulate science to support the proposal and claim, but in practice the policy was really never meant to help the electorate and is to the benefit of either a religious, ideological, corporate or socioeconomic segment of society. It's not necessarily that the policy isn't data driven or thought out, it's just sold as doing something else so it seems like it's logically and empirically unsound. 

The parties get away with it because the average voter is either not equipped or not willing to see through th BS and the media has failed to bridge said gap. </TEXT>

They won't see spencer as a loser anymore than 1930 Germans saw Hitler as a moody failed painter who wrote incoherent steam of consciousness tracts. 

Fascists want to be the victim and the aggressor and, just like in the 1930s they used anarchist and comunist movements in Europe as foils, culminating in burning (false flag?) attack on the Reichstag, Spencer will use this and similiar acts to rally people sympathetic to his cause.

For the fascists to admit spencer is a loser they have to admit they are losers or following him and it won't happen.

There needs to be a cold, dispassionate, colective rejection of the nascent fascist movement in America and this needs to come with programs that address wage stagnation, income inequality,  inadequate education, employment opportunities to strip the fascists of their recruiting base. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, insurance won't cover lost wages for the driver, lost income that pays the loan for the car and the insurance payments, the deductible, difference between cost of a comparable car and the pay out because of depreciation.

If your car gets totaled it still is thousands loss for you even if you were not at fault...and this is because of vandalism so definitely deductible. Almost new limo, so will lose on any depreciation of it simply being driven off of the lot. Lost income while waiting for replacement. Lost time dealing with insurance companies,  buying a new vehicle.

If you walked outside and some dick torched your car and drew an anarchist symbol your response would not be, meh, it's covered by insurance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did not ignore your point regarding alerting the world, it is buried in the middle there... I think it is valid, although idk how much US flies deterrence patrols already and how much radar coverage there is over the atlantic/ non nato radar coverage over southern Europe. Can Russia/ China detect a 2 bomber flight? I mean it is not like the refueling tankers are stealthy....

Anyways, the B52 would have been cheaper, and also losing one to engine failure or mechanical problem is no so irreplaceable. Rather I was wondering why they did this from the concern that Libyan factions/ ISIS somehow has access to SAMs.

Every reason they gave for using the B2 applies to the B52 at likely a lower cost... except for stealth.

	<TEXT> B52 is longer range, fewer refueling missions, net fuel might be less, especially depending where the refueling tankers are leaving from. Also b2 has a much higher hourly flight cost. So the total costs and even fuel cost of a b52 or 2 might be less when factoring net mission fuel consumption.  Although you correctly pointed out a pair of b52 would raise alarms from radar systems around the world. I am sure some calculus of available aircraft, threat assessments, training requirements and other considerations were weighted. I think though more went into this decision than simply bomb loads and even optics. China and Russia know we can do this as we did this in Iraq and Afghanistan and Bosnia... </TEXT>

The Scots feel they were betrayed in that they gave up their right to self-determination under false pretenses. It would be democratically sound for the scotish to revote on the referendum in light of this new reality and express their democratic principles and right to self-determination with the intention of joining the EU and being part of a broader European marketplace. 

Furthermore, the brexit vote happen under the aura of simply outright lies and misinformation by the brexit side. Democracy does not exist and a vacuum and is not always right, which is why most countries are republics or representative democracies. Putting such a vote as Brexit to a referendum was foolish and inappropriate... and back fired spectacularly.

Yes, it's a problem,  but not the same level as a full on military parade through DC past the capitol building.

The former glorifies the military and use of force, and advertises the military industrial defense complex. Similiar to movies it misses the gravity of war and sells the flashiness of the hardware.

The latter is state sponsored intimidation and implies a military in service of the commander in chief, rather than country. It's soldiers being reviewed by their commander for their commander that's the problem... it's Hitler/Stalin/Gadaffi/pick a Kim/ Sadaam/Nasser etc. reviewing their armies, not answerable to their people, but to their leader.

The US military answers to the Comander and Chief but serves the constitution and the people and as such it is inappropriate for them to march in review for trump... far more so than doing a fly by at a playoff baseball game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your argument is odd, where is it written in the constitution that your should pay for roads or the military or healthcare for the old or children or public education or any of the the other myriad functions of government that are vital to the function of a modern society? You pay taxes and the government spends accordingly within the limits of the constitution. 

The same principles came be applied to things you use like roads and bank acounts (fdic insurance) or military protection or airports etc...

If the government only protected property rights modern society and economy would not function. Basic research would not happen, roads would be unbuilt, our military would not be able to defend our borders, gps would not exist, when you got old and say need dialysis you would just die if you did not have the money, streams would be polluted, air would be polluted, you would have no standard for food safety etc... 

  Now if your beef is with the mandate, we'll think of it as a tax, it's really functionally the same. And healthcare is such that as you get older you will need it, it's a question of how much. 

Your model only works if we are willing to let people suffer and die... if we can limit care to those that can afford it then people will sacrifice everything for insurance, but then people with chronic illness or diseases would be screwed , unable to work and this get health care and the what? Is it productive to have them suffer?

Your argument is spurious and totally ignores the functions of a modern advanced society and how that is funded and also suggests a complete navet as the actual costs of the services you rely on to live a modern life and the risks to your wealth and well being from potential health problems, natural disasters, etc. 

It's not difficult to see how sometimes helping others in a organized central government makes everyone's prosperity and quality of life go up.

Like for a life saving drug... the company could charge anything and you would have to pay... or die. It's not like you can shop around. You had a stroke, you need a clot buster, the company says give me $1 mill, and say your insurance say nope, no covering that, are you going to argue? It's not like you have time to shop around or go to another hospital... that's why regulation exists.

	<TEXT> There are all sorts of things vital to women's health in the aca. Access to an gynecologist without a referral. Also without insurance oral contraceptives can be expensive, especially if for whatever reason women need a specific type. Furthermore, other contraceptive options are covered by the aca like mirena, depo, nexplanon. Repealing aca will decrease women's access to care and access to birth control. The situation is not free vs low cost, the situation is that with aca repeal for some women the costs will be prohibitive.

The same people who decry the aca, abortion and planned parenthood also lament freeloader welfare queens with many kids... you know women's control over reproduction is one of the few things consistently shown to improve poverty, well being of families and communities. Instead of worrying about whom might sleep with whom or who might get a free or unearned perk let's for once act on the societal interest.

1) Russians: Germany murdered about 20 million in WWII, in Russia one of the great sources of national pride was contributing to stopping Hitler. Everyone had someone they lost, sometimes entire villages. Evoking German domination plays to that narrative (even though many Russian work in Germany, buy German cars and generally don't have a grudge towards individual Germans).

2)  Eastern European states Russia traditionally sees in her Spenser of influence. They too were subject to German atrocities in WW2, although some of the are wary of Russia too. This is to try to prevent them from looking economically and socially westward away from Russia.

3) European countries with national pride etc... Russia wants them to resent German economic power and leadership in the EU to help fracture the EU. Especially Southern European countries with imposed austerity already have issues with German treatment. Also immigration etc. are wedge issues. Putin is exploiting historical fault lines to weaken his economic and geopolitical adversary and neighbors.

	<TEXT> Sadly, of all the things Wall Street has done, that they paid trump to speak to them makes me almost lose the most respect... they might have amorally bilked and defrauded Americans, gamed rates for their profits, etc...  at least they seemed competent at stealing people money and livlihoods. I can't imagine anyone with any understanding of business or finance sitting through a trump speech on either topic with without blowing a vessel in their brain. Moreover, compared to a lot of firms trump runs essentially an amateur small personal wealth fund... he is small fish for them... why would they want to hear him speak?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bernie is just rehashing the same stuff people have been saying on the dem side for 6 decades... it rehashed, it unimaginative and he clearly has no idea of how to implement his proposals or the details of his proposals. We are not a Northern European country, we have unique problems, infrastructure concerns, strengths and weaknesses etc. We need an updated creative progressive approach that works for america in the 21st century. Bernie's multi decade consistency is not positive, but a sign of a lack of imagination, intellectual growth or actual understanding of how policy works. 

Hilary can be accused of being closed off, not transparent, uncharasmatic etc... but she is not corrupt by any nations standard and her released emails and DNC emails show a dedicated public servant who care about her country...

Sorry but that corrupt crooked hilary narrative was a creation of ironically, actually corrupt and two faced trump campaign staff and republican establishment that is is actively draining the swamp right now...

Please show me how Hilary was corrupt... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think many people pushed Hilary just because she was a woman and I do think while not a primary cause, sexism was a part of her loss. But your caricature of militant women's rights supporters as being her base is just as off, incorrect and insulting as portraying Bernie supporters as neck beards and delusional college kids. 

A lot of professionals liked hikaries middle of the road polices, experience and wonkishness. She really liked getting in depth in policy and developing comprehensive policy proposals... she is not the 2 dimensional evil cartoon the republicans made her out to be and it's a shame the left let the republican slander campaign permeate their own rhetoric. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hilary and company dropped the bail too... everyone dropped the ball. Once Hilary had the nomination everyone needed to go into to overdrive mode and sort the whole Bernie thing out later and that did not happen. 

There was a time in fall of 16 when we could have prevented this mess and instead people allowed the republican narrative of Hilary as corrupt to take hold... and hurt progressives were a big part of that.

But yeah, we all messed up. And honestly Bernie was never going to be the savior people though he would be.

The democrats need to make the case to the average voter that their policies will make a difference in that average voters quality of life, employment opportunities and income and everything else needs to be out on the back burner... Bernie did a good job of focusing on that issue but did so in clumsy way that would have turned off middle American voters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not only did their unsophisticated minds not appreciate his nun chuck skills, but they were also unimpressed with his mall quality katana and were confused why he kept asking them to check out his "totally awesome unit"... 

In light of the females fleeing this clearly impressive mating display, he concluded that they must have been burglars; otherwis,e they would have totally stayed for netflix and chilled. </TEXT>
