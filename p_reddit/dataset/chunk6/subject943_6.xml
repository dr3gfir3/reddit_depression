	<TEXT> Good analysis and yep Illusionera is right. I spoke to one of the officers who brought Bosworth in. He was taken from his own family at a much younger age, so he was more malleable than Dylan  -he had completely lost his sense of identity. As for his bionic-like resistance to pain . . . I can only guess that they fed him with some kind of chemical-hormone shit that numbed him to feeling? </TEXT>
