	<TEXT> The difference is that Trump channels an inner despair of the American populace in a way that Boris doesn't. America's political system stops people's concerns from being heard and these concerns have created massive racial and economic inequality. If you're American, you're taught that your country and your systems of government is absolutely imperative to your freedom and there can literally be no other way. Meanwhile, most Americans realise that have no opportunity to find fulfilment because economic inequality is so acute. How do you deal with this sense of cognitive dissonance? While lots of Americans are supporting Sanders to change this very system, others are taking this pain out on those who they already feel superior to: black people, foreigners, immigrants.

The reason why people in Europe tend to view America unfavourably is that its wears its obvious and acute problems proudly and then with no sense of irony tells us we should follow their lead. What makes this all worse in the case of Trump is that he's emulating the very fascist politics that Europe resigned its world power to America over and there's nothing we can do about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I tried to say is that there are many things you can't "do a test for" - you can't hook someone up to a brain scanner to determine whether their sense of connection with another person is real. You can't do a test to understand a bunch of things: see Percy's Lost In Cosmos: A Twenty-Question Quiz. From the perspective of a single cell, it is likewise impossible to know of the fact it works in perfect synchronicity with others cells is mere coincidence or as a great unit of the human body. If God were to exist, that would be his relationship to us - he would be on a vastly more complicated level as the human being is to the cell the cell is directed from the human but not controlled and has the potential to get cancerous.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Atheists: How do you know that you aren't part of a greater whole? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-17 19:15:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1) Cogito ergo sum - the only thing we can authoritatively say that we know is what it is like to perceive the universe as ourselves. No amount of science will be able to tell us the exact nature of consciousness - it is impossible for us to distinguish a series of electrical currents from an actual being with its own subjective sense of awareness. It's impossible to explain certain existential things in scientific terms without saying "you're not actually alone in the universe; certain impulses or perhaps evolution makes you feel as if you are alone but you are really present right here", effectively dismissing the very things we live for. 

In other words, its impossible to reconcile subjectivity with one objective view of the world: if you were to say to someone who recently broke "love is just a bunch of chemicals that came from evolution - your relationship means absolutely nothing because its just a bunch of chemicals really" you would probably get punched because from their perspective, those chemicals are just a byproduct of something with meaning that only they can understand. 

2) It's impossible to know if one individual component part of a larger whole or not. We study humans on several different levels - society is studied through sociology, political science etc; thought patterns are studied through psychology, individual organisms are studied through biology and the forces that connect it all together are studied through physics. 

It would be stupid to attempt to explain, say cognitive dissonance on a chemical scale or biological processes on the scale of individual currents - cells are ultimately just a bunch of chemical elements arranged in a certain way, that doesn't mean we shouldn't study them on a biological level. Likewise, at some level humans are just cells and physical processes - that doesn't mean we should discount psychology, sociology, history etc when studying ourselves.

3) If indeed there are several different levels of existence that things can be studied at, how are we to know that we are the final, highest level of existence and we aren't just some component of some greater being?

	<TEXT> Yes you're right to charactirise gun crime as an urban problem and that ultimately makes it a racial issue. The sad fact is that guns massively exassibate crime in these places, contributing to systemic poverty and inequality. I think it was Samuel L Jackson that used the word "chiraq" to charactirise south Chicago - firearm violence is just so commonplace that it's not even newsworthy. Thus people get the mistaken impression that mass shootings are the big problem with firearms.

The reason why this is still good even though it's ineffectual is that it's an example of the the federal government making a foothold in a previously untouchable part of America's racial inequality. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Which sport best represents socialist ideals? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-02 13:13:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It has been said before that sport is the outdoor cousin of business. I don't think America's fetishism of enterprise would be possible without its obsession with sport. Major us sports leagues are a symbolic representation of the very concept of imperialism. Corporate sponsorship and racial aspects  aside, violence and competition at all costs in glorified, fans are meaninglessly turned on each other and the language of business is used to describe statistics and transfers. European fascist movements were at least honest about sport being a vessel for the construct of a 'new man', but this is only implied by capitalist society.

Fitness and exercise are natural phenomenon - a health body leads to a healthy intellect which is required if socialism is to ever be built. How can we we feed the pursuit of fitness into some kind of recreational exercise that does not reinforce patriarchal norms and is built on mututal cooperation, a desire to see everyone do better  rather than raw competition? Sport is one of the greatest joys of life and it would be fantastic if we could practice it without latently creating the conditions for capitalism, imperialism and patriarchy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a big supporter of Yvette at the time, but I've not resigned to the position of so many non-corbynites that don't even want to give him a chance. I understand the 'lesser evil' argument for backing whatever gets us elected but the fact is that in supporting neoliberalism so many members have forgotten that its evil at all. Blairism has very little to say about the errosive effects of neoliberalism and indeed propagates it in many instances. 

Some might call Corbyn a utopian, but I think it's utopian to think that the current economic order built on finance debt and house prices can last. I think it's utopian to suggest that international institutions like the EU will last. I think it's utopian to believe that we can carry on consuming our way to growth when global warming and resource scarcity hit. I think its utopian to think we can indefininely wage a global war on terror, and beat terrorism with surveillance. 

These things didn't seem utopian around 97, but the past 20 years have shown that some problems aren't utopian and the future will not be bright at all. Blairites don't seem to have moved on since then (which is at least better than the many tories who haven't moved on economically since the late 1800s).  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOOL] Instead of setting a new year's resolution, you should reflect on how far you've come </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-30 04:51:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  It's great to have goals, but you shouldn't be waiting for some arbitrary date or pressure from other people to set them. New Year resolutions reinforces the idea that you can only change yourself with some external cue. What this means is that when you say, eventually start smoking again you'll have no reason to get back on track. If you really *want* to get fit or learn a language or spend more time with your family, you shouldn't be waiting for the new year to do so. 

Instead, what I like to do is to look through everything I've done that year--all the places I've been to, all the things I've learned, what I'm grateful for, all the friends I've made, basically how I've become a better person than I was the year before. I also like to imagine where I want to be in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years and to try and track where my money went, all my journal entries, how much time I spend online, how anything I recorded or have data for changed in the year.  I try and be as realistic and as honest with myself as possible--and the truth is that 9 times out of 10 I will have made real improvements and become a better person that I was the year before. 

Once I've figured all this out, I'll type it up and put it on futureme.org and email it to myself for 1st January 2017. I'm excited for the new year because I'll get an email from myself that will remind me of where I was the year before, all the awesome stuff I did and get the chance to write the history of my own life. 

I find this is a more effective way of improving my life than setting arbitrary goals. I'm motivated to do it because everyone else is motivated by the new year, I get a sense of accomplishment and I get to stand back and think about where I'm *taking* my life rather than where its *going*. Had a shitty year and don't want to reflect on it? Not to worry, this system allows you to put all that stuff behind you and think about positive improvements you can make. Next year you'll look back at how bad it was and think about how far you've come!

It's such an easy thing to do that I think has lasting consequences and allows you to see the reason why you're doing certain things so that you don't have to wait for some random date to set your goals and really get whatever you want out of your life.

	<TEXT> Woah woah woah, I thought reddit hated pseudo-science? Medical professionals aren't recommending mdma for people with mental health issues. All too often people with mental health issues can fall into the trap of thinking that there's a magic pill that they can take that will make them 'better'. It's so easy to think that the answer to your problems lies without and they won't have to undergo difficult therapy to change the way they think within. imo addiction is entirely caused by depression and nobody in a healthy state of mind gets into alcohol/heroin etc

Having said that, depression is an absence of feeling and sometimes being able to remember what feeling great  is like can help. I would not recommend self-prescribed drugs though. You would be far better advised to get that feeling of accomplishment from organizing your life/exercising, taking up a hobby or practicing mindfulness/self-love. 

I'm sure I'll be downvoted, but if you want a more objective opinion, ask people in /r/depression not people who are rolling and want everyone to feel the same way they feel.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to understand though that technological 'advancement' doesn't always accompany human progress. In the interwar years, the Dutch pioneered in a national identification system to help redistribute goods and empower minorities. This was later used by the Nazis to identify and execute 'undesirable elements' of society. 

When we make these sorts of advances, we have to ask ourselves who controls them and who will benefit. The internet was a promised land back of self-expression and political engagement in the early 2000s and websites like Wikipedia were held up as examples for a future of participation and tolerance. Nowadays Tech is designed to discourage people from having to grapple with the grammar of its inner-workings, 90% of traffic is directed to about 10 different mega-corporations and regimes like china and isis use the internet to actively oppress peoples. Late modernity, has proven to be a period of political and social polarization where active learning and understanding is discouraged. If it weren't for the internet, we would have been able to correct reddity white males in public--nowadays they find e-silos where everyone shares their understanding of the world and their views are validated. Don't get me wrong, this has been great for groups like trans* people who have been able to find groups that accept them, but so long as the internet divides us it will entrench the dominant narrative--white male supremacy. 

Moral progress may be difficult to quantify, but this doesn't mean it should be ignored. Only when people have proven themselves responsible enough should they be given power and it would be inhuman to try and quantify this. Techno-capitalism cares only about short-term desire, it doesn't stop to ask whether things should be done only whether they can be done. 

You're right to say that this is pessimistic, but not unnecessarily so. It's a meta-narrative that helps us understand that social progress is not inevitable, that its never handed down from the top and it must be fought for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a reddity meliorist liberal idea. America was built on enlightenment myths of continual progress, which were in turn derived from the Judeo-Christian belief in redemption (see "Al-Queda and what it means to be modern" by John Gray). The reality is that we're living in times of accelerated economic and technological growth. These changes aren't being accompanied by moral growth and so economics and technology is entrenching existing problems and magnifying them beyond their own size. This has been fine for the past 20 years because we have been able to make progress at the expense only of future generations by abusing natural resources. When these resources start to run out, we will start to see that further progress will be impossible, yet we will be rendered completely useless without it so will start to eat into ourselves as a planet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's basically it--acid tell you the answers to deep seated problems, but it can help you see which questions are important to focus on. 

A lot of people who are drawn to acid are already asking those questions. For them, I don't think its useful. 

Instead of a disclaimer that says "acid is fine so long as you aren't mentally ill or in the wrong set and setting", the psychedellic community should say "You have the most to benefit from acid if you're confident in who you are and how you approach the world. Acid will show you areas for growth and improvement. If you are seeking answers to important questions, its best that you find those answers on your own and without chemical stimulation".  </TEXT>
