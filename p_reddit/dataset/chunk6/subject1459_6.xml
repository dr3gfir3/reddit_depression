	<TEXT> Not really. The question was specifically "In what cultures is it okay to cry in the office?" 

Based on what I've read in *The Culture Map*, Americans tend to be more emotionally expressive than the Swedish. I was actually expecting him to mention Russians, Italians, or some South American countries, which are even more emotionally expressive than Americans.

[Here's a good graph of how countries differ psychologically in business](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2015/11/R1512E_MEYER_COUNTERPART.png) (from *The Culture Map*)

The whole "How are you?" thing is definitely cultural, but it's a verbal formality more than anything else. Generally, Americans are actually more emotionally expressive than the Swedish in business settings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends. There are certainly situations where a woman can cry at work without it hurting how others perceive her, while it wouldn't be the same case for a man.

Generally, the stereotype is that men shouldn't cry. </TEXT>
