	<TEXT> I'm sorry you think that.  It was not my intention to reinforce your doubts.  That is also a repercussion this and is laid at the feet of the authority structure in the RCC-ultimately at the feet of the Pope.
My intent is to glorify God by calling His church to purity, exposing darkness to the light, and prodding repentance, not cover-up.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Found a good discussion article here:
http://www.centerforchristianapologetics.com/blogs/animal-pain-chapter-9-of-the-problem-of-pain-by-cs-lewis-by-jeff-jackson

The main points of Lewis are summarized here:  

"So what can we conclude from all of this? One, only God has immortality, two, only mankind has experienced the type of death that prevents the transcending experience back into the presence of God because of sin, and three, if animals do take part in a resurrection it is only because of Gods goodness to grant such an experience for the primary reason of granting joy mankind. Back to the question of whether all dogs go to heaven, its certainly speculation but seems there could be a possibility."

Again, just go read that chapter-he's such a pleasure to read!

Addm-sorry, I should say in the actual chapter Lewis discusses suffering of animals too, not just their possible resurrection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a costume-that's what the modern equivalent of a whitewashed tomb looks like.  Thousands associate the cassock with being raped as kids by pedophile priests.  Most of these monsters still don the cassock as well.
Sorry to be such a downer, but the RCC is not dealing with this problem.  It's still happening and your pope is granting clemency.
In my mind the cassock may as well be a millstone.
It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin.

	<TEXT> I don't think Jesus was excluding the NT from what He was talking about at all.  He was a Prophet and he dictated Revelations to John with specific instructions to write it down, so that invalidates the second part of your argument as well.  A good portion of the target audience was illiterate.  Also, a jot and tittle are things you WRITE, not say.

You've not yet answered my question.  If you don't trust scripture, then what do you trust.  Your processing power?  Your  study?    Your traditions?  At some point faith comes into play-but those deceived by transsubstantiationist argument aren't putting their faith in the Bible-they are putting it in a tradition that isn't supported by a reasonable reading of the Word at all.  I know the early church history-the good and the bad.  The Holy Spirit guided the selection of canon.  Matt 5:18 definitely applies-at the very least in principle-but as I stated above, I think specifically as well.  Jesus was not surprised by the NT at all-in fact he capped it off with Revelations Himself! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The canon was dictated by the Holy Spirit and the Word was guarded and kept by the Holy Spirit as well.  Jesus confirmed and amplified this in Matthew 5:18.

Scripture frequently refers to itself as "the word"-The sower sows the word.

John 17:17
Acts 8:4
Acts 12:24
James 1:22
Luke 8:11

	<TEXT> If God is with me...
I'm saying that Jesus was using symbolism.  It is obvious in the text.  The very ritual He was enacting with His disciples that BECAME communion is itself deeply symbolic and served as a memorial to a prior event.  He said "do this in remembrance " as they broke the bread.  
I don't want to make you cry, but a large portion of the Protestant or Reformed Church do not believe the heresy of transsubstantiation, so, being gracious to you I'll just pretend you weren't trying to deceive anyone with the first part of your post.

He clarifies a few verses later if you care to keep reading.

It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.

If He was speaking literally, then we would also be eating wood per John 15 " I am the vine".

	<TEXT> Where, might I ask, did you get the idea that only God was perfect?  You can't say the Bible, cause then you'd just be picking and choosing whichever parts YOU thought were valid and you would be sitting in authority over the Word!  IF you can't trust the Bible then you put your trust in men and you have built upon sand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesus could have called Himself many things-and did-so the Word is one of them.  He said not a jot or tittle would pass away-feel free to pray to the dead like a pagan-the Devil loves it when he gets you to enact ancestor worship like a pagan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable.
1 Corinthians 15:42 ESV
 Sola scriptura is not heresy-your papal infallibility and Mary worship as well as child-raping clergy is an open pit of corruption.  Your priests are the blind leading the blind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You implied that Christ followers who believe in the infallibility of the Word are deluded.  Jesus argues strongly that by God's power not even the tiniest punctuation of the Word would be lost.
Should we believe you or believe Jesus? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true-but you are twisting the sense in which it is.  Feel free to pray to whomever you like-but asking dead people to pray for you is a stretch.  Show me where in scripture it even indicates they can hear you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes.  When the Bible speaks about the Saints, it is speaking about living people.  Us.  No where does it recommend we ask those who've died, in Christ or otherwise, to intercede for us.  There is nowhere in the Bible that describes anyone other than God hearing our prayers. </TEXT>
