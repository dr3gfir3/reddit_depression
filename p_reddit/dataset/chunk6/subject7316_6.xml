	<TEXT> The overall gross neuroanatomy is quite similar between the various clades of the Hymenoptera (i.e. there aren't obvious brain modules that exist in one species but not others). That said, there are of course substantial differences in the sizes of various brain compartments between species. The most important differences are likely at the microcircuit level, but they will be much harder to identify.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good point - all animals are of course better at learning tasks that are closer to what they encounter in their natural environments. Bees are much faster at learning colours than cats for example - and that's because for bees (but not cats), colours play an important role in their daily activities of visiting flowers. -- In this particular case, we deliberately chose a task that is relatively far removed from bees' natural activities - we wanted to push them to their intellectual limits a bit! :-)  There may, under some cases, be tasks that are somewhat similar, though: e.g. bees might sometimes have to pull debris out of their nest, for example. But this is still quite far from pulling on a string with the explicit purpose of obtaining a sugar reward.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much! It's not straightforward to make a link between an animal's intelligence and their ability to cope with global warming, though. Many species of bees are already under stress from habitat loss (meaning the loss of suitable flowers as well as nesting sites), pesticides, and diseases. Global warming will likely add to this, since more arid conditions mean fewer flowers in many habitats, etc. What's a bee to do, even an intelligent bee...? It's clear that a bee species that is narrowly specialised on particular flower species (and can't easily learn to exploit other species)  will be in big trouble if it has to move north because of climate change, if that flower species is not available there. But generalists such as most bumblebees might do better, since they can learn to exploit new flower species (though they wouldn't have to pull strings for that...)  -- As for your second question, we have not done such an experiment, but I suspect that direct observation is necessary for the skill to be passed on. That said, Martin Lindauer did some work where he trained bees to forage at certain times of day, then raised the larvae from such colonies ("early or late risers") in isolation and then placed them in new colonies. The bees hatching from the larvae then were early (or late) risers as well! When they were larvae, they might have picked up the timing from dancing bees that were vibrating the comb as they danced.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on the species... there are about 300 species of bumblebees globally. Some species are already extinct locally and possibly globally; many more are under threat. A few species seem robust in most regions, and indeed some are spreading in habitats where they are not native, since they have been introduced by humans for commercial pollination purposes. Fortunately, in addition to nudging policy makers, there something that everyone can do to help ailing pollinator populations: to plant flowers that benefit bees (rather than ornamental flowers that have no value to pollinators). There is some useful information about which flowers to plant here: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/goulsonlab/resources/flowers and here: https://www.savelondonbees.co.uk/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there - no, the dance communication system is unique to honeybees, whereas these experiments were done with bumblebees. While the dance "language" in bees is unique and extremely impressive, it has only relative few "words" - bees only communicate about the distance and direction of a food source from the hive, and the quality of the food. They cannot inform other bees about things other than location - so they cannot "talk" about the colour of flowers, or indeed complex tricks such as how to pull a string. The bumblebees in our study learned this  without the experienced string-pullers making an active investment into passing on the technique. The learners just "scrounged" on the information provided, by observing the skilled individuals.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There isn't a single, easy explanation. In some cases, it looks as if in insects, single neurons can take on the tasks that are mediated by 1000s of neurons in vertebrates. For example, Martin Hammer discovered a neuron that, all on its own, appears to constitute the olfactory reward pathway in bees (whereas in the mammalian dopaminergic reward system, there may be 1000s of neurons involved in this task. In other cases, there may be multi-tasking of single circuits in multiple tasks in the insect nervous system (see e.g. Niven, J.E.   Chittka, L. (2010). Reuse of identied neurons in multiple neural circuits Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 33: 4). In yet other cases, seemingly complex abilities might be mediated very simple neural connectivities (e.g. Peng F.   Chittka L. (2017) A Simple Computational Model of the Bee Mushroom Body Can Explain Seemingly Complex Forms of Olfactory Learning and Memory. Current Biology 27(2): 224-230). In terms of at least some forms of social learning, there might not be such a fundamental difference between vertebrates and invertebrates. Cecelia Heyes, for example, has made the point that many forms of social learning hinge on relatively simple forms of associative learning that are just co-opted into social processes in some animals.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on how you define coolness... :-) There are many - in addition to the remarkable learning abilities, there are their strange sensory worlds - the fact that bees can see ultraviolet and polarised light for example, and use this for identifying flowers and navigating securely over many miles from their hive. One important difference between bumblebees and honeybees is that only the latter have a "language" - the "waggle dance" - a symbolic code by which they can tell each other, in the darkness of the hive, about the precise location of a rich flower patch they have discovered. No other animal (humans aside) has such a code, and bumblebees don't either (they just have a chaotic "slam dance" by which they alert other bees to the current availability of food, without passing on the coordinates). What is perhaps even cooler is the fact that honeybees use this dance communication system in a consensus building process when a swarm decides on a new location to live in. There's initially a lot of disagreement between scouts, but ultimately everyone in the swarm agrees on one destination. The process if described beautifully in Tom Seeley's book "Honeybee democracy".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's quite likely, so long as bees first had the opportunity to learn that these other animals or robots have 'meaning' for them (i.e. their presence is associated with reward). Darwin already suggested that honeybees could copy from bumblebees the technique of nectar-robbing (where bumblebees bite holes into the spurs of flowers as a shortcut to the nectar, and honeybees then use the flowers). We haven't experimentally tested whether this is true, though bumblebees can certainly learn from honeybees where to find the most rewarding flowers: Dawson, E.H.   Chittka, L. (2012).

	<TEXT> Sure! One observation is that some individual bees are always exceptionally smart. Some years ago we did an experiment that required us catching the bees in black film canisters on every departure and return to their nest (to weigh them). Most bees initially resisted, but eventually got used to it. One bee, however, learned to fly straight into the black container, even if we held it in the air several meters from the nest, and expected us to transport her back to the nest. -- In another experiment, I kept a bumblebee colony in a greenhouse. The greenhouse was sealed tight, since I wanted all the experience to occur with just the artificial flowers I had set up in the greenhouse. However, a few bees eventually came back with pollen from natural flowers - and I found out that they had discovered a drainage hole in the floor of the greenhouse, walked through a drainage pipe for about 2m, and then emerged on the other side to look for natural flowers. -- Wasps are very smart, too! On one occasion, one of my team members trained a honeybee to locate the correct visual pattern in a Y-maze, and a social wasp came along too. The wasp learned the task faster and also learned to exit the lab faster than the bee. And in the end the wasp killed the bee and then had the setup to itself... - I'll pass on the greetings! :-)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very interesting question! Certainly generalist bees (such as honeybees and most bumblebees) that naturally visit a wide range of flowers, and arrive at their favoured ones by learning which are the most rewarding ones, are relatively well equipped to benefit from exotic flowers. But since, as you say, there may be only relatively few stands of some of these plants in any one garden, this will certainly keep bees on their toes, and in some cases force them to multi-task and visit multiple flower species (that may all differ in colour pattern, scent, and the particular motor patterns required to harvest pollen or nectar). We do know that bees need to learn the techniques to harvest pollen efficiently: Raine, N.E.   L Chittka. (2007). Pollen foraging: learning a complex motor skill by bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Naturwissenschaften, 94: 459-464, but we don't yet know if a fine-motor skill like this can be learned socially from other bees. Some techniques, however, are certainly copied, for example nectar robbing, where bees 'steal' nectar from long-tubed flowers by biting holes into the tubes - Darwin already suspected that bees might learn this from other bees, and here it is confirmed: Leadbeater, E.   Chittka L. (2008). Social transmission of nectar-robbing behaviour in bumble-bees. Proc. R. Soc. B, 275: 1669-1674. So while it's not certain whether skill transfer is more in demand in urban areas, you are quite right that the small size and diversity of flower supplies may place higher demands on the learning skill of urban bees. This could be tested both by observing how many species of plants are typically visited in urban versus rural or natural habitats, and also by testing the learning skills of urban versus natural pollinators in the laboratory.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's an interesting question... but I'm sure that bees would pick up on this change very quickly. They are generally very good at figuring out the quickest path to a reward, especially if the task is easy (just landing on an open accessible flower). If however, we presented the bees with artificial flowers under a glass table, but without a string, they would certainly spend a great deal of time rummaging about at the edge of the glass table in an attempt to look for the string. And bees are certainly creatures of habit: for example, in one experiment, when we moved a flower that bees had visited multiple times, we found that bees would visit the learned location again and again, even after multiple failed attempts: Lihoreau, M.D., Raine, N.E., Reynolds, A.M., Stelzer, R.J., Lim, K.S., Smith, A.D., Osborne, J.L.

	<TEXT> Change was part of the training procedure for many bees. Only two individuals solved the task spontaneously, without any stepwise training or observation of skilled bees. For the others, we trained them by gradually changing the difficulty of the task. At first, flowers were completely 'open access', then they were partially hidden under the glass table, then completely pushed under the table. Bees cope very well with this sort of change, where tasks change only moderately and difficulty increases slowly. A trick to put animals on the spot is a so called reversal learning test, where they have to learn that the opposite of what they previously learnt is now true. So for example, in one phase, blue flowers are rewarding and yellow ones are not, and after bees have learnt this, you switch the contingencies around. This can be very confusing for bees, especially if you reverse the associations several times. But if you do it multiple times, bees will pick up on the schedule on 'learn to reverse learn' very quickly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some years ago, I founded a research centre for biological psychology at my university, and was fortunate to recruit a number of outstanding scientists working on the intelligence of apes, corvid birds and parrots, and indeed on human cultural evolution (the ways in which ideas and technical innovations spread among human populations, in ways that parallel genetic evolution). I had always been working on bee learning and memory, and I guess there is a perception among my colleagues working on larger-brained animals that all the behaviour complexity we see in bees, impressive though it may be, is largely based on instinct. While bee researchers had long known that bees learn the location of their hive and flowers, as well as the colours and patterns of flowers (etc - all of this is not just sensory-driven but requires learning),  there was a challenge for me:  I asked what may have seemed an entirely mad question when we first started  could we get our small-brained bees to solve tasks that might impress e.g. a bird cognition researcher? Could we find some individual bees that would innovate and solve a difficult puzzle, and could these techniques spread through a bee population in a similar manner as in human cultural evolution, by more and more individuals copying the technique? The bigger-picture goal, though, is to explore just how much cognition you can achieve with how small a brain. This will give us information about the minimal neural circuits for any particular learning task, and how circuits in miniature brains can effectively multi-task to juggle a large number of behavioural skills.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Lars Chittka and I am a professor of sensory and behavioural ecology at Queen Mary University of London. My research focuses on the learning processes, the sensory organs and the social behaviour of bees, and their interactions with flowers.

I recently published a study titled ["Associative Mechanisms Allow for Social Learning and Cultural Transmission of String Pulling in an Insect"](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002564) in PLOS Biology. In this study, we discovered that bumblebees can solve a string-pulling puzzle, where they had to pull on a thread to retrieve a reward from an artificial flowers that was presented under a glass table, so that bees could see it but not reach without pulling the thread. Moreover, we found that inexperienced bees could learn the technique from experienced ones, so that the skill spread rapidly to a majority of colony members, in a manner similar to the cultural spread of new innovations found in humans.

I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET -- Ask Me Anything!

Since these kids already have a partial chromosomal duplication, there are very straight forward genetic tests for diagnosis. And since Dup15q syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder, I would expect any treatment would be most effective in children for whom developmental trajectories can still be altered, but of course we want to work towards findings that benefit anyone and everyone with this disorder.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Joel: Thanks for your question. I definitely anticipate that in the future, we will think of autism as many different but related disorders. To stratify autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we need biomarkers that relate to disease mechanisms. In this study, we have identified an EEG signature that likely relates to the overexpression of GABA_A receptor subunit genes that are duplicated in Dup15q syndrome. Other individuals with autism might have more subtle aberrations of GABA_A receptors, such as point mutations. They might also have a more subtle form of this EEG signature. By relating this and other biomarkers to various causal mechanisms, we can move towards an understanding of autism that is rooted in distinct mechanisms with distinct treatments.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Joel: Id like to add that autism is, in a sense, really dozens of different disorders. The reason that Aspergers and autism were consolidated into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was because there is so much heterogeneity within this spectrum that no one knows where to draw a meaningful line. Yes, I absolutely expect that we are going to find quantifiable, biological differences between different forms of ASD, and one of the goals of biomarkers is to stratify ASD into meaningful subgroups.

One reason we focus on Dup15q syndrome is because we already know the genes involved, so it is likely more tractable to treat. There are many, many genes involved in autism. Some forms of autism are caused by copy number variants like Dup15q, where deletions or duplications of a handful of genes have a large clinical impact. Other forms of autism are also caused by mutations in a few important genes. But very commonly, autism is driven by many different mutations in one person, each mutation individually having a modest impact. The sum of all these mutation, though, may converge on autism. 

So returning more to your question, we are starting with the most tractable forms of ASD with the goal of eventually being able to understand the heterogeneity within the spectrum and to offer treatments for as many of these different clinical subgroups as possible.

	<TEXT> Joel: Thanks for your question. Some genes duplicated in this syndrome, such as [GABRA5]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892036216301210) and [UBE3A]( http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/3/103/103ra97.short), cause autism-like behaviors when their expression is disrupted in animals. Obviously, we cant do the same experiment in humans where we change gene expression and observe behavioral effects. But the whole logic of treatments that target proteins encoded these genes would be that they are causing the disorder. 

What we still need to learn is *which* specific genes in 15q11.2-13.1 are responsible for *which* symptoms. Most of the research has focused on UBE3A, which is also deleted in Angelman Syndrome, but I think the role of the duplicated genes encoding GABA_A receptor subunits has been under-emphasized. The fact that the EEG signature we've described looks so much like what is seen in drugs that modulate GABA_A receptors suggests that they might be important, but the exact relationship between these GABA_A receptor genes and autism or intellectual disability is uncertain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Charlotte:  Your first question has been covered in a couple of other replies, so I'll just answer the others. :)

Yes, lots of exciting research happening in the ASD world!  Here's a nice summary that Spectrum put together.  https://spectrumnews.org/features/special-reports/2016-year-review/   I think we're developing a much better understanding of the heterogeneity within ASD, which is hopefully going to improve our ability to target interventions and really improve outcomes for individuals with ASD.  

In terms of better understanding ASD, I think the most important thing is to be aware that it's a large and diverse spectrum.  It's diagnosed based on broad categories of symptoms (e.g. impairments in social communication, the presence of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests), but how those symptoms manifest is extremely variable.  The one stereotype that I'd love to change is the idea that children with ASD don't like social contact, or aren't affectionate.  Individuals with ASD often have difficulty with social interaction, but can still be very interested in being with people!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Charlotte: Great question!  Yes, there are lots of things that can contribute to the EEG signal.  For that reason, research generally tries to be pretty rigorous about the participants who are included - we want to avoid as many confounds as possible.  In our studies, we generally exclude any participants who have had significant neglect/abuse in early childhood (e.g. were adopted from an orphanage), have sensory impairments (significant vision/hearing loss), or had birth trauma.  We also carefully document seizures and medications, since those can affect the EEG signal as well.  It's not perfect, but we do our best to disentangle all of these potential confounds from the variables that we're actually interested in (in this case, genetic diagnosis). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Charlotte:  That's a good question.  You're correct that within the ASD population, epilepsy is associated with intellectual disability.  However, individuals with more "mild" ASD also have rates of epilepsy that are higher than the general population.  A meta-analysis from 2008 found that among individuals with ASD who do not have intellectual disability ("high-functioning", although I don't like that term), 8% had epilepsy.  That's a lower rate than in kids with ASD and intellectual disability, but much higher than the general population (.5%).  

Given that ASD is such a heterogeneous condition, it's likely that different genetic and biological mechanisms contribute to the very different characteristics that we see.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These are all great questions. Because Dup15q syndrome is a very rare disorder affecting about 1 in 10,000 individuals, we did not have a large enough sample to do machine learning classification. But the effect sizes here were very large, d  1. We have not yet done EEG source localization, so we dont know where in the brain the signal is being generated. As measured here, its smeared across the scalp. Any guesses about cellular mechanisms would be highly speculative at this point, so theres a lot of exciting research to be done.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Joel: Great point, beta is very broad, usually defined as 12-30 cycles per second or Hz. In this case, the signature was strongest toward the higher frequency end of the beta band (sometimes called beta2), with a peak around 23 Hz, which you can see [here]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=large id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167179.g004). The beta finding was very diffuse across the scalp, but strongest in frontotemporal regions. We also observed lower delta (1-4 Hz) activity in the children with Dup15q syndrome, which is interesting because patients with deletions of the same region actually have elevated delta activity. 

We have yet to correlate this biomarker with autism severity or ADOS subscores, but that is an exciting direction for this work. In this paper, though, we did show that the EEG biomarker is associated with epilepsy. 

Glad that youre excited about our work! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Joel: Thanks, this is a great question. We think that this EEG signature would be a very promising measure of target engagement in future clinical trials. In other words, by measuring this biomarker, we could perhaps infer whether a drug is actually engaging the GABA_A receptors that the treatment is targeting. Furthermore, because physiological changes should precede behavioral changes, we could use this biomarker to perhaps tell whether neural circuit changes are occurring, even if the trial does not last long enough to see the behavioral changes that might take much longer to observe.

An important next step, of course, is to do preclinical work in animal models of Dup15q syndrome that will correlate this EEG biomarker with GABA_A receptor subunit gene expression. We also want to correlate the EEG biomarker with clinical traits in humans with the disorder. By learning what clinical traits the biomarker is possibly associated with, we will know what aspects of the disorder might be improved by a treatment that alters this EEG biomarker.

	<TEXT> Charlotte:  Thanks for your question!  In order to improve treatments for ASD, we really need a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the deficits we observe.  Right now, our treatments are based on behavioral symptoms.  E.g., a child has a difficult time with social interactions, so we do social skills intervention to try to improve their social abilities.  While this works great for some kids, unfortunately it doesn't help us understand why some kids DON'T make a lot of progress with intervention, and what we could be doing differently with them.  Although one genetic disorder only accounts for a small percentage of cases of ASD, research like this helps us understand what some of the neurobiological mechanisms might be that underly the deficits we observe.  That in turn will help us understand why we see so much variability in terms of children's development and response to intervention, and will hopefully help us develop and target interventions that will work best for specific children.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great question. EEG signatures that are as clear as what we see in Dup15q syndrome are very rare. It is likely that children with other forms of autism have EEG features that would be useful as biomarkers, but they are probably much more subtle.

Its hard to talk about a normal EEG because there are different ways of analyzing EEG. Clinical EEGs are read qualitatively and examined for unusual activity. Research EEGs are more often quantitative EEG (qEEG), which is analyzed digitally with a specific hypothesis in mind (like what we did in this study). Many researchers examine the EEG frequency spectrum using Fourier transform to look for abnormal EEG oscillations, for example. A growing trend in the field is also to examine the complexity of the EEG signal, for which there are many measures. For instance, [this study]( https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-9-18) was able to distinguish infant boys at high and low risk for autism using EEG complexity as measured by multiscale entropy.
 
In terms of clinical EEG findings, about 20% of children with ASD have epilepsy (at least two unprovoked seizures), and abnormal EEGs are reported in up to 50%.  Abnormal EEG in this case just means that there was something unusual noted on the childs clinical EEG, so its not just one specific signature.  We dont have a great understanding yet of what this high rate of abnormal EEG means, especially since it varies so widely across individuals.
 
So to answer your follow-up: many children with autism do not have a clear or overt EEG signature, but this likely means that we need more innovative techniques for unlocking the information in the EEG signal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Charlotte: Estimates vary a little bit, but about 75% of individuals with dup15q syndrome have ASD.  The characteristics associated with dup15q vary quite a bit.  In addition to ASD, we most commonly see intellectual disability, epilepsy and motor impairments.  However, this can range from a relatively mild impairment to individuals who have significant delays all areas of development (e.g. don't develop spoken language).  We recently published a paper looking at the clinical characteristics of children with dup15q syndrome, and how they compare to a sample of children with non-syndromic ASD.  In our sample all of the children with dup15q met criteria for ASD on a common diagnostic assessment (the ADOS), but our sample likely skewed a little bit to the more impacted end just due to the nature of kids we see in our clinic.  You can read more here if you're interested!  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27158270

In response to your last question, dup15q syndrome is generally maternally derived.  It doesn't appear that paternal inheritance leads to the disorder, although it's possible that the paternally derived duplication leads to an extremely mild phenotype that just isn't ever diagnosed because there aren't any noticeable impairments.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess the obvious question is, are there good inverse agonists of the GABA-A receptor and have they been tried in Dup15q syndrome?

Great question, we are considering exploring something along these lines.

Further, which alpha subunits do you think are most relevant to Dup15q?

GABRA5, which encodes the alpha5 subunit, is duplicated in Dup15q syndrome.

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Joel Frohlich and I am a neuroscience PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the lab of Dr. Shafali Jeste. My research uses brain waves or [neural oscillations]( http://knowingneurons.com/2016/05/18/brain-waves/) to identify quantitative, biological markers (biomarkers) of autism and neurodevelopmental disorders. These biomarkers can be used to guide treatment or inform outcomes in patients. Our lab places electrodes on the scalp to measure neural oscillations in children, a technique known as EEG.

My name is Charlotte DiStefano and I am a postdoctoral fellow and clinical instructor at UCLA. My research focuses on cognitive and language development in children with neurodevelopment disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and related neurogenetic disorders.

We recently published a paper titled [A Quantitative Electrophysiological Biomarker of Duplication 15q11.2-q13.1 Syndrome]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167179) in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/). Dup15q syndrome is a neurogenetic disorder caused by partial duplications of chromosome 15. It is one of the most common [genetic duplications]( http://knowingneurons.com/2016/09/21/copy-number-variants/) that causes autism spectrum disorder, and it also confers high risk for epilepsy (i.e., seizures) and intellectual disability (ID). We used EEG to measure a particular frequency of neural oscillation called beta in children with Dup15q syndrome and found that *beta oscillations distinguish children with the disorder from other children with autism and ID, as well as healthy children*. Remarkably, *this EEG signature looks just like the EEG signature seen when a person takes benzodiazepine drugs* that bind to and modulate inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors called GABA\_A receptors. Because several genes that encode these receptors are duplicated in Dup15q syndrome, we think that this EEG signature might be indicative of GABA\_A receptor subunit expression. For this reason, *the EEG signature we've identified might be useful for guiding clinical trials that target these neurotransmitter receptors*.

My colleagues and I will be answering your questions at **1pm EST** (10am PST). We're looking forward to discussing our work with these awesome kids. Ask Us Anything!

As for the algorithm, it's built by some MIT researchers, and you can read more about the math behind it in the paper and its associated citations. The concept of "gravity" is certainly a good one, though, as you note, certain sub-centers depend on larger ones for their own pull.

	<TEXT> Alasdair: thanks for commenting. Inspirations? Well, we do like data and maps but we start with questions. In this case it was basically 'what does the economic geography of the US look like on the ground?' - i.e. where do you draw the boundaries if you consider commuting. Commute data were available and are a key economic dataset so that is where we began. 
Data: American Community Survey commute data.
Advice: think of interesting questions and useful analysis. You can always learn software and techniques but think very hard before doing any analysis about what it is that matters. That would be my basic advice. Don't worry about making mistakes or breaking things and particularly don't worry about not knowing stuff. The more you know, the more you find out that you're just scratching the surface!
Also, keep up learning ArcGIS but also explore open source tools like QGIS.

	<TEXT> Alasdair: this is related to the geographic scale of our analysis where sometimes places quite far apart merge into single megaregions. Sometimes it's because there are a group of long distance commuters (perhaps even commuting on a weekly basis) but other times it may be that they are relatively well connected in the context of the national pattern as a whole. In short, some regions can look odd and this is certainly not a definitive final map, but it does mirror broad underlying commute patterns. Sometimes they surprised us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Garrett: Here's a quote from Lewis Mumford that I think bears on your question: 

 The more thoroughly one is acquainted with the social and geographic facts in any area, the more keenly one becomes aware that unity and differentiation go hand in hand. When one searches for unity, the human race is obviously one. When one looks for differences one discovers not only national types and regional types, one discovers likewise important differences between a Florentine and a Neapolitan, between a Glasgow man and an Edinburgh man, even differences in language, accent, gesture, feeling between villages that are but a days walk apart. Finally, one reaches the primordial unit of individuality and realizes that no two identical finger prints of different persons have yet been discovered. Unity does not annul difference; and difference does not undermine a dynamic unity. (*The Culture of Cities* (1938), pp. 310311).

As that quote suggests, yes, we can always go smaller, and break a whole region up into smaller sub-regions (and then break those up, and so on). Similarly, we can always go bigger, since pretty much the whole globe is covered in a dense layer of interconnections. The trick is finding some "stable" geographic areas at the in-between of unity and difference! </TEXT>

These require tricky judgment calls. This area may not have many commuters leaving its fairly self-enclosed territory. But should we call it an "independent" region on par with Greater NYC or Greater LA? That's one of the situations where qualitative analysis has to be brought to bear on the computational results.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Garrett: I was also surprised at the line that almost perfectly traces the WI-IL border, especially given that these two states have a tax reciprocity agreement. It just goes to show how old boundaries have the ability to reproduce themselves. Folks from Janesville might think of people from Wausau as being more their "neighbors" compared to those from Rockfordeven though from a purely "natural" geography that makes no sense. How we imagine ourselves in places has huge effects on where we choose to live, travel, and who we interact with! </TEXT>

It's important to note that the borders we've drawn don't represent solid lines across which no commutes occur. And we're also not saying that everyone within these areas is commuting to one central location. Instead, we're looking for *relatively well-integrated sets of points*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alasdair: you're right in relation to the question of long commutes. However, you would be very surprised by some of the extreme commutes, which you can see on p.8-10 of this if you're really keen: http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/89361/7/WRRO_89361.pdf The point is that the 'megaregions' are a kind of geographic container for smaller sub-regions and your FL example is a good one. But, within these wider areas there are some very long 'mega-commutes', for sure. On b), the final map involved a bit of human interpretation as well. It's the only one where we tried to combine our decision making with that of the algorithm. Think of it as a map for discussion and debate rather than a final product! Thanks for these comments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Garrett: What's important to note about the size of the regions is that they *don't* mean that everybody is commuting to a single place. In fact, more people commute long distances to get to NYC than they do to New Orleans, but New Orleans is set inside a much larger region than NYC is in this research.

The reason is that we're trying to find *collections of relatively interdependent nodes.* For instance, if point A is strongly connected to B, and B strongly to C, and C to D, then those four points seem to make up a whole region even if very few people are commuting from A to D. 

Meanwhile, you can *always* drill down smaller, detecting sub-communities within sub-communities even down to the neighborhood level. So the problem is to figure out where there are meaningful breaks in the pattern. 

In reply to your follow-up: the data makes no distinction about mode of transport. All we know is how many people leave one census tract (as their home, or origin tract) and arrive at another census tract (as their work, or destination tract).  </TEXT>

Without powerful computers (we used Amazon servers), we could never have processed the enormous amount of data included in this set.

	<TEXT> Garrett: Definitely. As we note in the paper, commutes are just one proxy for the kinds of economic and social relationships we're interested in. But of course, goods circulate as well as people! And there are other important flows, too. William Cronon, in his book *Nature's Metropolis*, uses bankruptcy records to show how capital flows connected Chicago to vast swathes of the Midwest in the nineteenth century. You can pick many different variables like these and use them to argue for different kinds of "whole" geographies. </TEXT>

But those old borders, of course, still have power: they control where we vote, where we pay taxes, where laws are enforced, and so on. Our hope is that by offering an evidence-based analysis of how people move around, we can push both administrators (like transport planners) as well as ordinary citizens rethink what geographic categories are most relevant today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Garrett: I'll add to this that creating "fair" electoral districts is definitely one place where we hope this research informs policy. However, there is a big catch: the requirement that electoral districts have roughly equal populations. That *wasn't* a requirement for our regionalization; we're concerned only with "whole" sets of commuter relationships, regardless of the population involved.

While electoral districts certainly can be more or less fair, there is really *no* way to create a perfect algorithm that would take border-drawing entirely outside of human subjectivity. The heterogeneity of geographic patterns simply leads to too many potentially "correct" solutions.

With that said, I'm currently working on a districting algorithm that uses density-based core areas to agglomerate equal-population districts. Keep an eye out for more! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Garrett: This is a very important question which, to be answered properly, requires invoking political theory, sociology, and the philosophy of organismic complexity! I can't do all of those topics justice here, but both the Haldane and Alexander pieces you quote above are good examples of the theory that there is some "natural" size of human community, above which size organized social functions tends toward chaos. This is a very old idea: Aristotle, for instance, also argued that there was a correct size for the ideal community, summed up by the rather tricky concept of "self-sufficiency."

In our case, we artificially limited the community-detection software to produce 50 communities, a number based on the current count of US states (the final map, as noted, includes some subjective toying with the purely computational boundaries). However, these are *not* limited by equal population. Some regions are an order of magnitude larger than others.

Here again, we face the tricky question of "self-sufficiency." Imagine two small communities that *only* have economic interactions with each other. Then imagine a massive conurbations of cities deeply interlinked. Does the former, isolated region deserve to be "one" place, and the latter, interlinked region also deserve to be just "one" place? Herein lies the paradox at the center of this research!

	<TEXT> Garrett: This is a great question, and it points to some issues with how we treat "big data" as a kind of evidence. In the case of our study, the commuter counts come from the US Census Bureau, and therefore the data set doesn't include international commutes. My hunch is that if such data were available, you'd likely see some international regionsperhaps Seattle-Vancouver, Buffalo-Niagara, or, as CptnStarkos suggests below, San Diego-Tijuana.

Because the available sources for large data sets like these tend to come from national agencies, they have the effect of reproducing the territorial integrity of the nation itself. That's one of the reasons why we should always be careful about claiming that data analysis leads to some perfectly "correct" or "true" solution.

Regarding ethnic groupings: the Cooper Center's [racial dot map of the United States](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/index.html) is an absolute must-see on this topic. While it doesn't include commutes (just home locations, aggregated by block group), it still makes residential segregation shockingly apparent.

If we could find good data about individuals race/ethnic status as well as their commuter habits, it's possible you'd begin to see overlapping regions, where different kinds of people inhabit very different territories. For instance, it's likely that many of the people commuting into New York City from Westchester County are white, while a self-contained commuting group in Harlem and the Bronx could emerge. Those are just guesses, of course, but they suggest some of the ways in which a totalizing geography has its limitations. </TEXT>

We were interested to see what would happen if we tried to divide the country up based on patterns of commuting, but using a computational approach rather than a cultural or historical one. As you can see, the results do make some sense geographically, but of course we realise they are not perfect! In fact, our work was in part a test to see whether you can use algorithms on their own to do this kind of thing. Our conclusion is that you also need human input. We use commuting because it is a very important part of the economic functioning of the nation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is [Alasdair Rae](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/usp/staff/alasdair_rae) and I am Senior Lectuer in Urban Studies and Planning at the University of Sheffield, in England. My research focuses on geographic analysis, and particularly on how places connect, or not. One of the main things I'm interested in is the difference between political boundaries, such as counties and states, and how this compares with patterns of human connection on the ground, such as commuting and migration.

And I'm [Garrett Dash Nelson](http://people.matinic.us/garrett); I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the Society of Fellows and the Department of Geography at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. I work on the history of geographic problems in planning, and I'm interested in how the human landscape and social action structure one another.

Last month, we published a paper titled ["An Economic Geography of the United States: From Commutes to Megaregions"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166083) in the journal [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/) . We were curious what would happen if we tried to divide the geography of the United States up by using data about millions of Americans' commuting habits, instead of relying on old borders like state and city lines. We tried two ways of interpreting the data. First, we made "flow maps," which allowed us to visually interpret where clusters of commuters are congregating. Second, we used an algorithm to do what's called "community detection"finding groups of closely related points within a network of complex interrelations. We ended up with a new map of the United States that offers a new way of thinking about what kind of areas match the geographic patterns of our real lives.

We'll be answering your questions at 1pm ET -- Ask Us Anything!
