	<TEXT> Recently I've been drinking the chocolate Pure Protein, its decently priced at Walmart around here. Pure protein also has decent protein bars! Another favourite is chocolate Genuine Health Proteins+, but that is definitely pricier. Pinterest is great for healthy recipies!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I have! not too in depth, but I recently heard about Dr.Nandagopal who works at USculpt clinic in Vaughn. He's apparently known for skin removal surgeries! I haven't gone to see anyone yet though. Good Luck with your journey! :)  </TEXT>
