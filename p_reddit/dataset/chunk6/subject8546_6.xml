	<TEXT> Exactly. I don't mind it if you *know* you're faster than me. Like you noticed you were closing the distance between us before we hit the light. But struggling to find room to pass someone who just pulled in front of me at a light at rush hour drives me insane. 

I assumed this happened to me more because I'm a woman and men just assume they'll be faster (I have to say, women rarely do it unless they're legit going to speed off into the sunset). But this thread is making me realize it's pretty universal.  </TEXT>

Definitely keep contributing in [insert appropriate way], but trust that everyone here knows what they're doing. In some cases better than you."

Fortunately, the Robert S. Peabody Museum in Andover, MA, took excellent care of the ancient maize specimen--one of the five oldest known in the world--for decades. Wales explains that this particular cob and the DNA within it had been unusually well preserved. "Archaeological specimens frequently have high levels of bacterial DNA due to decomposition and soil contaminants," he says. "However, during genetic testing of ancient cobs, we were astonished to find that 70 percent of the DNA from the Tehuacan162 cob was from the plant!" Most other ancient samples contain less than 10 percent plant DNA.

This was the most interesting part of this to me. This sample was taken at a time when this wouldn't have been possible, but still preserved well enough to do it now that we can. Just goes to show that we have to consider future scientific advances in our work now.  </TEXT>

A more practical reason everyone has to pay is that when they excluded people without a TV, radio, or computer, almost everyone claimed not to have a TV, radio, or computer.  </TEXT>

Also, some interesting details on how her legacy was preserved in a small college library and ultimately published. 

Her hope ... was that her paintings will assist the earnest student instead of serving merely to entertain the visitor
