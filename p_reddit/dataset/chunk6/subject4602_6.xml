	<TEXT> That's a fair point, but I do see it having enough variety as compared to SFAM which has everything from metal to mellow pop to ragtime to jazz fusion and The Dance Of Eternity which is considered the most prog song of all time. GA1 is definitely Prog, more so than most of Coheeds albums, but it's about a 7 or 8 level prog whereas SFAM is an 11. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-08-23 16:31:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This song is pretty cool. I like the playing with time signatures in the chorus. I think it's 10/8, which is wonderful. They were definitely still prog despite what I've heard some people say. This song is really not underrated, it's considered one of the best off VT from what I've heard, but honestly I'm not a huge fan of it. It's good, but bland compared to Ghost Rider, Secret Touch, or Out Of The Cradle.

**Meaning of Earthshine:**

 Earthshine, an astronomic phenomena first described by Leonardo Da Vinci in the Codex Leicester between 1506 and 1510, is the term describing the sunlight which is reflected by the Earth to illuminate the Moon. This happens every 29.5 Earth-days, hence the lyric "on certain nights, when the angles are right..."

___

***Geddy:*** Earthshine was just not right in its original incarnation. The lyrics were very interesting, and very evocative, but I didn't feel in the end-and Alex agreed-that the music really equaled what was there lyrically. We were selling the lyrics short. So we had this jam music that we really were excited about, especially this riff, this main riff, that is the verses for Earthshine, and I rebuilt the song vocally around that riff. Then we proceed to just carry on with it, and before we knew it we had a whole knew song that was really exciting.

***Alex:*** Earthshine was the first song that we wrote. At the time we both felt that we weren't going to be too precious about it, it was part of that early period that we went through with the writing, about 5 months into the project I guess? Six months? We reviewed the song and decided to completely rewrite it. There were some lyrical changes, but 100% of the music was thrown into the garbage, and we started over again with it. Which was really a testament to working this way without a deadline, and how important it was not to have a deadline with this record.

___
 In Neil Peart's bookGhost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road, he wrote that his brother Danny read the poem Funeral Blues (W. H. Auden) at his daughter Selenas funeral, the poem contains the lines "The stars are not wanted now: put out every one; Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood, For nothing now can ever come to any good." This inspired the lines in this song "All the stars fade from the night The oceans drain away." ^^[Source](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3796)

	<TEXT> Okay, so this has been a long time delayed, but it's finally here! I'm gonna go through the TWRP discography a song a day so we get a little discussion about each and every one in and can easily swap opinions and maybe find new favorites!

This is a great intro to TWRP as a whole. It gives a wonderful preview into what this album is going to be and eases you in perfectly. It's just a snippet, but it's a damn good snippet.

	<TEXT> The reason I was given was that I wasn't "mature" enough, couldn't pitch in for shipping for giveaways, etc. But the real reason (I think) is that I wasn't really active there.

I'd browse the modqueue often, make sure people were following the rules, but the head mod was pretty much doing the job I did. About the time she went off on me in our old private mod chat for not pulling my weight (she wasn't really giving me or the other mod a chance to) and subsequently opened up the mod applications I realized I was pretty much gone. We hit 1,000 soon after, but I felt like I was being a bit left out of discussions and knew 98% that I was going to be booted so I didn't bother with the listen through like we planned.

Admittedly, I should have put more effort in on that sub. Even though I was being removed soon I should have done the listen through anyway. Hell, I may still do it! But I was a little bitter at it happening, a bit hurt with the secretive and sudden fashion it was done, and the fact that I wasn't warned at all so I made some poor decisions. None of this is in bad blood. I respect the mods there, they did what they had to for whatever reason they did. I wish them the best of luck and wished that I had done things differently but hindsight is 20/20. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This song went unnoticed for waaay too long. Personally, it may even be my favorite on VT as a whole. The excitement and energy presented in the verse paired with the mellowness and optimism of the chorus.

rushvault.com had a wonderful summary of the meaning of the song:

 There are days, no matter who you are or how well your life is going, that youre a little down. Its an existential trap that even the best of us are subject to once in a while. Maybe the weather even has something to do with it. Some cloudy days are more than just a weather event; theyre a reflection of how we get down in the dumps. On these days, were suspended between how it is and how it ought to be. Its just a part of the human condition. But, importantly, its just a moment in a persons life. Eventually, well move on, and things will go well, and theyll also go bad, but theyll move on, up and down. Then, at some point, well once again be suspended between how it is and how it ought to be. ^^[source](https://rushvault.com/2011/02/16/how-it-is/)

As someone who deals with depression, this song reminds me that life isn't all sadness. There will always be good days, and there will always be sad. Life requires both and if you have both, you know you're doing *something* right.

Spam's only gotten through once, and I don't think I've ever had to ban anyone! You guys are really awesome and hands down (may be a bit bias though) the best fan community/subreddit I've ever seen.

Seriously, thank you so much! </TEXT>

It doesn't mention that, I dunno, do this exact same thing. I have multiple history books from things as far as memoirs from a prisoner of a French penal camp in (I think) WW1 (it never says), to the memoirs of WW2 veterans, to a book on Nazi experiments, to even something different like the Bath Massacre.

Or how about that I've been playing bass roughly 2 hours a day straight on average for a bit over a year and a half now?

Or how about that I've made a point to take at least one walk/bike ride a day?!

But do I love to learn, I love to do stuff other than watch TV. And what the fuck do you care anyway? </TEXT>
