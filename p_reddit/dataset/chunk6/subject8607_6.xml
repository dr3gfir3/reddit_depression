	<TEXT>  New amendments to the bill added last Thursday would allow sheriffs deputies to report the release dates of serious and violent felons to ICE. The changes also clarified the language of the bill to allow state and local law enforcement agencies to participate in task forces, even when immigration enforcement becomes an element of the investigation.

 And under the amended bill, law enforcement officers would be able to notify ICE if they come into contact with a person who previously has been deported and has a violent felony record.

Sort of ironic you complain about "simplistic labels" while ignoring large parts of the "bullshit bill" - a pretty shallow analysis.  </TEXT>

...

 In the past, the Syracuse clearinghouse had received information from ICE about individuals' arrests, detainment locations, detainment dates and deportation dates, should an immigrant be deported, Long said. The agency also previously released criminal histories, including charges, convictions, sentences and corresponding dates.

...

 Now, the group only receives information as to the nationality, gender and citizenship of a given immigrant, as well as the date a detainer was prepared, the law enforcement agency it was issued to and local body's response. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Fake news can be effective. A poll released earlier this week found that 74 percent of Republicans now believe Trumps evidence-free claim that his Trump Tower office were wiretapped, or under government surveillance during the 2016 presidential campaign. **When House Intelligence Committee chair and former Trump transition official Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) made a clumsy attempt to validate Trumps claim last week, the story was quickly amplified by Sputnik and RT.**

The circle jerk of treason.

	<TEXT> Nunes is chair of the House intelligence committee, which is investigating the Russian involvement in the election. Trump has already cried wolf on himself being the victim of illegal surveillance, by tweeting Obama spied on him. That didn't work. So now he's going through Nunes, who can give the cry a little more credibility (or at least ambiguity) by *seeming* as somehow the result of the investigation.

It's very important for Trump to look like the victim of illegal surveillance, because the truth is he was being surveilled by U.S. counter-espionage forces for communicating with foreign spies. </TEXT>
