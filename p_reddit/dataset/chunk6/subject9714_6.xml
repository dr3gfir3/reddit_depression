The other lawmakers on the panel did not respond as of Wednesday evening.

Members of the committee have not been beating a path to Kislyaks door, a senior Senate Armed Services Committee staffer said, citing tensions in relations with Moscow.

	<TEXT> The marathon running turned out to be a total waste of time.  I was eating high carb, low fat.  It did nothing for me.  Prior to running, I was into bicycle racing.  I raced 2 years as a semi-pro.  My body fat was 8%.  I was riding 4-5 hours a day, 6 days a week.  I was burning a lot of calories and my food bill was over $200 a week.  I didn't know what I was doing and neither did anyone I was racing with.  The training was bad and diet was bad.  After bike racing, I started running.  I was not a good runner as I was a bike racer.  I couldn't sustain the bike racing.  It was a lot of work, and no money.  I took that as far as I could.  When I started the running, I was gaining weight from the standard American diet of low fat, high carb.  Every year, I gained weight and got bigger and bigger.  I have run 8 marathons, and countless 1/2 marathons and 10k.  Changing my diet was huge.  Over a year of low carb, high fat and doing intermittent fasting, I went from 30% body fat back down to 10-12% body fat.  It was amazing because I was not starving myself.  It was all diet.  I still run and do bike rides, but only once a week.  I do weight lifting.  I like weight lifting because I can do a 30 minute workout, 5 exercises, 5 by 5 and be done.  I get results and doesn't take any time.  Biggest bang for the buck.  Exercising to lose weight is a big waste of time.  It doesn't work.  Changing to a diet that lowers insulin, for many people, it works!  And if a person eats fat, they can lose weight and not be hungry.  Proof is in the pudding. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Calories are not equal.  A sugar calorie is not the same as a fat calorie.  Eating sugar will spike insulin which causes energy to be stored in fat cells.  Eating fat doesn't spike insulin so nothing is being stored as fat.  [Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health]
(https://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462/)

Further, eating carbs and sugar makes a person hungry 2-3 hours after eating.  Insulin clears the body of energy.  All the energy is gone in the blood, and insulin blocks the fat cells from releasing more energy.  A person has to eat again.  When I eat sausage, eggs, and butter for breakfast, I can easily go 6 hours without eating and not be hungry. </TEXT>

One year I ran 2 marathons.  I didn't lose any weight that year.  Many years later, I changed my diet to low carb, high fat.  I lost 50 pounds of weight, and all I did was sit on the sofa and watch TV.  Go figure.  Eat fat, get thin.

	<TEXT> Well we're living here in Allentown

And they're closing all the Christian bookstores down

Out in Bethlehem they're killing time

Filling out forms

Standing in line

Well our fathers fought the Second World War

Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore

Met our mothers in the USO

Asked them to dance

Danced with them slow

And we're living here in Allentown

- Billy Joel

Don't forget about the Iranians, Al-qaeda, or ISIS. You must live in fear. Arrggghhhhh! It is crazy. Amazing how scared the Republicans are, and how easily they think the rest of us scare.

	<TEXT> FoxNews is in the "Business of Anger". There's an entire business...a huge industry, actually...that bases all that it does on getting you p!$$ed off! Rush Limbaugh. Bill O'Reilly. Glenn Beck. Alex Jones. All variations of the same thing: people in an industry who want you to believe their function is to "move the public dialogue forward" or to "make an opinion count on your behalf"...blah blah blah. But NO!

Their sole function is to make you angry. That's right. Get your dander up. Get you riled up and feeling as though you're right and all those other asses are wrong - and stupid! In turn, they hope that you'll pay more and more attention to them - while they reinforce your growing anger and disillusionment - and give them big ratings and more money from their advertisers. </TEXT>
