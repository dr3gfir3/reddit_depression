	<TEXT> A guy (who I later found out was a twin) at my school died of some heart problem during a PE (physical education) lesson. I didn't know he was a twin, I had only seen them both separately around school and assumed it was the same person. It really screwed with me when I saw his twin brother walking around school the next week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words. I truly am devastated. There is no reasoning with the Brexiteers either, they're like a cult. I dislike the arrogance and hatred displayed by so many in this country. I think the media is very much to blame for the attitudes. They are so hateful and racist. They also scapegoat immigrants and the EU for the country's problems, when in reality it is mostly our own politicians to blame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There have been an estimated [107 billion humans](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16870579) who have ever lived. The average person walks [110,000 miles in a http://snowbrains.com/brain-post-how-far-does-the-average-human-walk-in-a-lifetime/).  

107 billion x 110,000 = 11,770 trillion miles  

Since 1970 the total number of miles travelled by vehicles in the USA was approximately [106 trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M12MTVUSM227NFWA). The USA is approximately 5% of the world's population. Assuming the whole world travels the same number of miles by vehicle per person as Americans (this is a high estimate) then then the total miles travelled by land vehicles since 1970 is:  

106 trillion x 20 = 2,120 trillion miles by land vehicles, which doesn't come close to the distance travelled by humans.  

There is a lot of room for error in these figures, but it seems highly unlikely we have travelled more miles in land vehicles than on foot. </TEXT>
