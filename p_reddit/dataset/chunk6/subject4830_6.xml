	<TEXT>  I think there can be a healthy, moderate practice of this idea of enduring in the midst of suffering (such as the simple believe that hard work pays off in the end) but Catholicism takes it to the excess, to the point of getting its believers drunk on suffering.

I like the idea of the [Serenity Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer). As I get older, I find that in most situations there is a way experience less suffering. Often it's just talking with someone else about a situation, can help me feel better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I inherited and adopted some of this masochism as a Catholic. When situations became a struggle I generally wouldn't ask for help. I would be fuckin' miserable and just try to plow through it. I thought all the pain was just part of the process, and I generally didn't question it. I would even look down my nose on people taking an easier approach.

Now, I hate the saying "that which doesn't kill you makes your stronger". Back in the day, I did that. Maybe I learned a few things along the way with this stubborn attitude, but it wasn't worth all the misery. I'm glad I can more easily notice the warning signs when I see myself starting to do this now, and generally can ask for help. </TEXT>

Slowly I started to see how I kept getting into the same situations and started to understand the thought patterns behind it. There was plenty of it tied into my Catholic upbringing, guilt, shame, anger. It took some time to unravel all of it, but I can honestly say therapy was the best thing I've ever done for myself. </TEXT>

From my casual sampling of players on local Pokegon Go Facebook groups, most people have all or almost all of the currently available Gen 1 and Gen 2 babies. I just need to walk my Togepi 45 more km to gen enough candy to evolve it. I'm not all gold level on all the achievements, so that's another project to work on, but the excitement is starting to slow down, for me. Why risk having all the daily players drift off before they drop Gen 2?

Edit: an intermediary option could be to remove the region restrictions so we can catch three more Gen 1 mons. </TEXT>
