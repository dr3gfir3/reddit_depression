	<TEXT> This sub seems to be interested in Opening Montages or Intros if you will. Here is one of my personal favorites from honestly my favorite remake.

Apparently Johnny Cash and end times go hand in hand. The shots of real life riots mixed with the takeover give a really creepy vibe and snippets of genes mutating fit right in. I really like the shots of news teams reporting from the scenes.

If you haven't watched this movie or hadn't *planned* on watching this movie during October Check It OUT. 

**Zombie takeover? Better get to the mall.** </TEXT>

Old : **Stargate** (1994)

Both of these movies are near the top of the Sci Fi genre in my book. They are both very different but very enjoyable. I really don't like Tom Cruise movies but that being said Edge of Tomorrow was brilliant from start to finish. Stargate sparked my fascination with ancient Egypt as a young boy.
