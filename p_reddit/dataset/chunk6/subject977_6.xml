Klar war es nur eine Frage der Zeit bis sowas auch in Deutschland passiert, und natrlich ist das nicht weniger schlimm als in Frankreich. Noch schlimmer macht es das es auf einem Weinachtsmarkt passiert ist. Jedoch sollten wir uns jetzt nicht weniger sicher fhlen und natrlich als eine Nation zusammenhalten und knnen sicher auch auf Untersttzung von Frankreich bauen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aight that seems like a good plan, as I have a spare HDD. It's only about 500GB and I planned on wiping it anyways and doing something new with it. So if I understood you correctly :I just install Linux on that one, obviously with the HDD I installed Windows on removed and then I could just switch in the BIOS between the HDD I want to boot from.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure but can't you split your hard drive into partitions and then have Linux on one so you can boot up either Windows or Linux. I got an old HDD laying here and I'd be quite interested in testing Linux.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mhh I guess more people are picking Jesus over Muhammad since they're more familiar with his stories and I guess some think of the Islam as a religion for terrorists, which is not true. But since I don't really know shit about the Koran I can't talk about it. 

In the end I'd pick Muhammad to get some other viewpoints. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And Sacr Cur is a really beautiful place, too! I was there with my french class and it was breath taking. The only downside is that there are people trying to scam you. When I were there they tried to grab your arm tie you a wristband and then they want you to pay "little money" for it. The shocking thing is that when we went up the stairs some policemen were casually patrolling around with their weapons.

	<TEXT> Ok so this is kind of a tricky thing and I am sorry to not directly answer your question. I've talked a lot about this with a friend of mine and we have very different opinions on this. But let's view both of the viewpoints.

Friend:
Whatever you do in the past will dramatically change the timeline. Even if you just leave the house one minute later that could change everything, maybe because of that two people don't meet, fall in love have kids and one of those kids cures cancer. All because you left the house too late. 

Mine:
Every action is a chain of previous reactions and most of the things you do will only change minor things and might only change your timeline. Let's say you sit next to a stranger on the bus and don't let him exit his stop so he has to get of the next stop. Well my theory says that his chain of events is only slightly changed so he might be a bit too late but nothing else will change, he won't get fired from his job, neither will he get hit by a car.
