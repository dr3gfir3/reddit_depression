	<TEXT> Am I the only one who has had Vienna sausages and liked them? Being the product of a single family home, we had to make due with what we could and Vienna sausages with mac and cheese was a staple. I've given it to my kids and they enjoy it as well. I'll have one or two of those formaldehyde soaked sticks before serving them. </TEXT>

As far as playing the victim, you have these tapes. You have the evidence that is not a victim, so I don't think you would lose your children. Does she really want them around? She sounds like a miserable person who cant be bothered to be a parent. Would she be open to you increasing your % of custody? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The day me and my ex started telling our family that we were pregnant she started to spot. We ended up going to the ER where after 8 hours one of the nurses told us that we were so early in our pregnancy that there really wasn't anything that could be done. I remember us crying to sleep that night. I remember the voicemail my mom left me (I notified her by sending her a silly e-card where a stork is flying and it said something like delivery date tbd, just something out of the norm, kind of like the relationship we share) where she said "Hey, got your email. I'm not sure what this means... are you guys pregnant" and her voice cracked because of how happy she was. We happened to have her OB doctors appointment the next day anyway and he did the ultrasound. There he/she was, floating around with a "blood bubble" next to him/her. The doc said "oh boy, I don't like that." Told us to take it easy, not necessarily bed rest easy, but no heavy lifting for a week and then come back for another ultrasound. I'm happy to say our son is 8 years now and full of life.

Be positive OP, I wish and pray the best for you and your wife. </TEXT>
