	<TEXT> Just like the title says, post up related art from around the web.

Going to be playing a deep sea diver / Big Daddy type Warforged Barbarian, and would love to see some art work similar to that idea (to use as reference etc).

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saw that great megathread on Ryders combat focus/loadouts/abilities. Was there anything similiar on squadmates?

Not just the rando names like 'crisis specialist' for Liam etc.

Thanks! </TEXT>
