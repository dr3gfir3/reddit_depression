	<TEXT> You are especially likely to be happier if your personal projects feel attainable. In fact, Little has found that our confidence in achieving our projects is an even more important factor for our wellbeing than how much meaning a project has. Put differently, there are few things worse than having a core personal project that feels unobtainable. In fact, findings show that when someone is engaged in a personal project that makes them stressed and miserable, this is an even more powerful drag on their wellbeing than other more obvious factors like poverty. The perfect combination is to have one or more sustainable core projects that feel within reach and are also full of personal meaning, reflecting what matters to you in life. </TEXT>

The man was a former professor at Yanbian University of Science and Technology (YUST), Yonhap said, citing unnamed sources. YUST, a university in neighboring China, has a sister university in Pyongyang. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quist has seen a surge in momentum as the race earns national attention, raising $2 million in six weeks and racking up endorsements from progressives. Quists most notable endorsement came from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who plans to campaign with him next month.

His campaign got off to a rocky start after reports about his 16-year history of financial troubles, including unpaid debts and property taxes. Quist blamed the debts on medical costs, arguing that they help him better understand the issues of voters with their own money struggles.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The special election spotlight shifted west this week after a hard-fought race in Georgia. Now all eyes are on Montana, where a popular local folk musician will square off against a wealthy businessman to fill the states lone congressional district.

After unexpectedly strong turnout from Democrats in Kansas and Georgia special elections that nevertheless failed to flip the seats, the pressure is on in Montana as outside money pours in and attack ads flood the airwaves ahead of the May 25 vote for the seat vacated by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump was condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike last year after he criticized Curiel's rulings in the Trump University case and attacked Curiel personally.
One of Trump's harshest rebukes came from House Speaker Paul Ryan, who described the language as "sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Trump's remarks "offensive and wrong" and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a staunch ally of Trump, called the comments "inexcusable" and "one of the worst mistakes Trump has made."
Trump later defended himself in a written statement, saying he did not believe "one's heritage (made) them incapable of being impartial." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it's unclear what direction the Trump administration is going to take in handling marijuana legalization in US states, Department of Homeland Security secretary John Kelly was rather clear about where he stands on the issue.

And like Attorney General Jeff Sessions did earlier today, Kelly sounded the alarm against trans-national crime organizations.

"And let me be clear about marijuana. It is a potentially dangerous gateway drug that frequently leads to the use of harder drugs," Kelly said in a speech he's giving now at George Washington University. "CBP will continue to search for marijuana at sea, air and land ports of entry and when found take similar appropriate action.

DHS personnel will continue to investigate marijuanas illegal pathways along the network into the U.S., its distribution within the homeland, and will arrest those involved in the drug trade according to federal law.
So far, seven states  including Washington, California, Colorado and Massachusetts  have legalized recreational use of marijuana. And a total of 27 states in the US have legalized medical marijuana. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old political novice, is leading a field of 18 candidates for a U.S. House of Representatives seat that was vacated when Trump named Tom Price as his health secretary.

An Ossoff win would not tip the balance of power in Washington but could weaken the already shaky hold Trump has on his fellow Republicans by encouraging lawmakers to distance themselves from him.

Georgia's 6th District has elected Republicans to the House since the late 1970s, but Trump only carried it by 1 percentage point in the November presidential election.

Ossoff hopes to win an outright majority in Tuesday's vote, a "jungle primary" with all 18 candidates from both parties on the same ballot. If no one reaches 50 percent, the top two vote-getters square off on June 20. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> President Donald Trump is claiming he cannot be sued now that he has won the White House -- a defense in a lawsuit that alleges Trump incited rally-goers to violence when they allegedly assaulted protesters during the 2016 campaign.

In a court filing Friday, Trump's lawyers argue twice that the President has blanket immunity against lawsuits.
"Mr. Trump is immune from suit because he is President of the United States," the attorneys wrote, adding, "Mr. Trump is immune from proceedings pursuant to Clinton v. Jones."
In the case, three protesters, Kashiya Nwanguma, Molly Shah and Henry Brousseau, accuse two men, Alvin Bamberger and Matthew Heimbach, of assaulting them at a Kentucky rally in March 2016. </TEXT>
