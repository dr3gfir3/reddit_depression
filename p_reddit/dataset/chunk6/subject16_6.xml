	<TEXT>  Ein Werbeverbot - auch ein komplettes - wrde meiner Meinung nach absolut nichts bringen

Da scheint mir die Erfahrung mit dem Tabakwerbeeinschrnkungen eine andere zu sein. 
Zumindest das Werbeverbot beim Sport knnte einer der Grnde fr die sinkende Zahl an Neurauchern sein.

Man wird in Deutschland von klein auf konditioniert den positiv besetzten Sport Fuball mit der Droge Alkohol zu verbinden. Dies war frher bei Formel 1 und Tabak beispielsweise auch der Fall. 

Wie beim Rauchen bringt man durch die Werbeverbote keinen Alkoholiker zum nchtern sein, aber man macht die Droge weniger cool unter Jugendlichen. Man fngt die negativen Auswirkungen sozusagen bei der nchsten Generation ab. 

In der Wissenschaft scheint mir auch der Konsens zu herrschen, dass ein Werbeverbot effektiv wre:

[A systematic review of 13 longitudinal studies of over 38,000 young people found convincing evidence of an impact of media exposure and alcohol advertising on subsequent alcohol use, including initiation of drinking and heavier drinking among existing drinkers.](http://www.clinmed.rcpjournal.org/content/9/2/121.short)

und noch direkter:

[Tobacco control and studies investigating the effect of alcohol advertising bans on consumption and alcohol-related deaths point to the effectiveness of such action - ideally supplemented by other policy interventions.](http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S0256-95742012000700010 script=sci_arttext tlng=es)

	<TEXT> Das Hauptproblem ist hier auch wieder das die CSU in der groen Koalition so viel Macht hat. In Bayern laufen die Uhren anders. 

Erst wenn sich in den letzten bayrischen Bierzelten mit dem Krieg gegen die Drogen keine Stimmen mehr fangen lassen, wird dieser deutschlandweit zurckgefahren werden. Leider. 

Vorher knnen hchstens einzelne Lnder ihre Polizei anweisen die Strafverfolgung sein zu lassen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Als Bundesminister ist seine Aufgabe auch der Schutz der Verbraucher. Alkohol fordert jhrlich bis zu 74.000 Tote in Deutschland. **60 mal so viele wie alle illegalen Drogen zusammen.** Auerdem wird Alkohol mit vielen Krankheiten in Verbindung gebracht, darunter Speiserhren-, Leber- und Brustkrebs. Handlungsbedarf sieht der Politiker nicht.

-

Deutschland hat ein massives Alkoholproblem: In zehn Jahren ist die Zahl der Alkoholvergiftungen in den Notaufnahmen um ein Drittel gestiegen  auf fast 120.000 pro Jahr. 1,8 Millionen Menschen sind alkoholschtig. Tendenz auch hier: steigend.

Gleichzeitig versenkt man Milliarden in den Krieg gegen die Drogen. Schon abgefuckt das Ganze. Das die Prventionsdinge ja ohne Verbot am Besten funktionieren sieht man an der jhrlich sinkenden Zahl Jugendlichen die neu das Rauchen anfangen. 

Insgesamt aber ein sehr guter Artikel. 

Die Frage am Ende stellt sich mir auch nach dem Lesen:
Am Ende bleibt die Frage, warum sich die Parteien und ihre Spitzen-Persnlichkeiten dafr hergeben, mit Bier und Wein zu posieren. Geht es nur darum, keine Whlerstimmen zu riskieren? Schlielich trinken die Deutschen gerne. Oder steckt doch die Alkohol-Lobby dahinter? Ihr Netzwerk reicht weit in die Politik hinein  brigens auch bei der EU in Brssel. Und vergessen sollte man auch nicht: Viele Bundeslnder besitzen Weingter oder Brauereien. Sie mischen mit in der Branche, die von laxen Regeln seit Jahrzehnten profitiert. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What happened yesterday is not "military action in Syria". Obama and our European partners did fight ISIS all the time (including with air strikes). 

It was an air strike on the forces of the current Syrian government. Which is a completely new and different thing. And something that Trump always insinuated Hillary wants to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is true, he is a very emotional guy that decides on his gut feeling, but I am not sure that is the case here.
I think he is easily swayed by talk of power play and asserting dominance. Mattis / McMaster probably just knew what buttons to press to get him to approve the airstrike. He probably just valued their advice more than the one coming from the Bannon faction.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My guess is that Bannon was against the Syria strike, being the isolationist America First guy. 

The Generals and the other globalists on the other hand convinced Trump to go throught with it and demote Bannon. 

Given the huge amount of positive press the airstrike got and the first time that he truly looked presidential I think he will really like that. This may lead to further ousting of everyone who against the intervention and thus could lead to Bannon getting kicked out and Trump becoming a common neoconservative. Which would be really ironic given all his campaign rhethoric.

	<TEXT> If you were to read the article you would realize that it is far from "stupid".

On health care Trump's rhethoric was all over the place, basically just showing he has absolutely no idea. This is one of the few areas where his previous statements at least had internal consistency. Which did not keep him from throwing them overboard immediately.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For more evidence that the airstrikes were a departure from Trumps usual rhetoric, look no further than who he is agreeing with: Hillary Clinton. Clinton, speaking at an event in New York earlier on Thursday, had said that the U.S. should attack Syrian airfields. During the campaign, Trump had attacked Clinton as too eager to use military force abroad, constantly dismissing her views on world affairs. Youre going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton, he said in October.

-

Its also not clear how the public will react to Trumps decision. In 2013, a CBS News/New York Times poll found that a majority of Americans (57 percent) said that the U.S. should not launch airstrikes in Syria. A Gallup poll from last year showed that 34 percent of Americans wanted the U.S. more involved in Syria, but a majority said America should either remain at its current level of involvement (29 percent) or do less (30 percent). But both those polls were taken while Obama was in office; partisan views of Obama and Trump may affect how Americans feel about Syria policy, and the photos of children who were killed by the chemical weapons attack could shift public opinion as well.

-

Finally, authorizing military action and then addressing the nation is a big, presidential action, the kind Trump had not yet undertaken. It puts Trump at the center of the action, instead of reacting to Congress, and it complicates the strategy of Democrats, who generally oppose whatever this president proposes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remarkable to read this on Fox News:

It is the young Trump presidency, however, that takes the biggest hit here. Trump was elected because people across the political spectrum thought he could fix some of our problems. He was the businessman who could import common sense to Washington, and the deal maker who could bring people together. He made big promises; a country tired of stalemate and disappointment believed that he could bring back jobs, reduce our debt, build the wall, find a better healthcare solution.

**His credibility and credentials now lie in tatters.** All that optimism that has stoked the stock market and boosted investment plans  all that may fade. </TEXT>

**I am not suggesting Ryan is some kind of political genius.** The problems here lie with Trump. He is strongly committed to his personal project of being the president, being seen as a great dealmaker, and appearing on television, but he is weakly committed to his ideological project and obviously uninterested in the details of legislation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They do not talk about correlations but relationships. It is quite a bit more complicated than a simple correlation as it factors out different things. 
From their method section:

Latent semantic analysis (LSA)  the technique from natural language processing that weve adapted for this analysis  is often used to determine how related one book, article or speech is to another. The basic idea is that documents using similar words with similar frequency are probably closely related. But what about the words themselves? LSA also allows you to assess how similar words are by looking at the other words that show up around them. So, for example, two words that might rarely show up together (say dog and cat) but often have the same words nearby (such as pet and vet) are deemed closely related. The way this works is that every word in, say, a book is assigned a value based on its co-occurrence with every other word in that book, and the result is a set of vectors  one for each word  that can be compared numerically. On a very technical level, the way you determine how similar two words like dog and cat are is by looking at the angle between their two vectors (theres a visual guide to understanding these concepts below).

You can get their R code here. It is pretty well documented and surprisingly easy to understand (if you have some experience with statistical analysis):
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/subreddit-algebra

It is fairly straightforward to apply it to other subreddits. They choose to write an article about the_donald, but I guess there are more interesting relationships on reddit that are not political in nature.  </TEXT>
