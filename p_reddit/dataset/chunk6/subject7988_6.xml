	<TEXT> I'll start by comparing profits: 881671 for 2014 and 923503 in 2015 an increase of 4.7%. Next sga: 603660 for 2014 (68% of profits) and 932232 (99.9% of profits, looks like Musk and stagg is loving your investments) for 2015 an increase of 52.8%. Ouch. Net income: -294040 for 2014 and -888663 for 2015 an increase in losses of 202.2%. We will see what end of the year 2016 brings. But the numbers make it very obvious that tesla rides on hype, not performance. Hopefully all goes well for the tesla investors though, I wish the best of luck! </TEXT>
