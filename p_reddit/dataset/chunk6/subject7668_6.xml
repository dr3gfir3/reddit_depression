	<TEXT> I used to be 130-135 at 5'6. It's kind of hilarious that he said this though because he's been so interested in sex as opposed to like three months ago. I think he just doesn't wanna admit that he thinks I'm more attractive now after losing weight from my ED. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I was gonna wait till tomorrow to post this because it's officially October first but I just can't wait. Do you guys know what you're gonna be for Halloween? Also, do you have goal weights set for Halloween? I've been in a bad binge and restrict cycle for awhile so I'm hoping to get control of that and lose my remaining five pounds before Halloween so I can comfortably fit into the XS Harley Quinn costume I ordered.

Does anyone have any ideas for more Halloween costumes? I want to have at least two because I go to college and there's gonna be four days straight of parties. 

EDIT: preferably something cheap/home made for the second costume!

Also this is the costume I ordered! https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0073E565A/ref=mp_s_a_1_10/152-2656204-0031514?ie=UTF8 qid=1475264360 sr=8-10 pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65 keywords=harley+quinn+costume </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, this is true. Just like being "big boned" is bs. Sure your natural skeletal structure is a layout for how you look but it isn't enough to just say "oh my hips are wide so I can never be skinny".

It annoyed me that OP would say they don't have an "anorexic" body type. Welp, being anorexic myself, that's not cool. Anorexia isn't a "body type"...........

Anyone can become slender or skinny and have a small body if they lose the weight. Without working out, metabolism only fluctuates a bit from person to person.

Also, I am not saying that being bigger is bad at all. I wish I was confident with my body when I had more meat on my bones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thats ok, you dont have to feel bad. this really is my problem and i feel guilty causing strangers to feel bad for me.

i tried a bunch of meds for about a year but none of them helped at all. they only made me gain weight. 

i used to be able to drag myself to work/class, but now ive missed so many classes that i risk failing. ive been depressed since ive been a toddler, and wanted to hang myself in elementary school. There have been "highs" and lows, but things have taken a turn for the absolute worst this year and i feel theres no way out. i really really have tried sooo hard to get better. I wasted so much money on all sorts of programs and meds, and im worse. 

i want to believe this will pass, i really do, but i also have to be realistic with myself. i know the cycle i am in. i know it will never end. i cannot live this way </TEXT>

I'm a B cup and still have a butt. I'm slender but not a "skinny girl". So many of the actresses on tv border underweight or are underweight, and are what many guys find to be the most attractive. They don't realize how many actresses, models, college girls etc are actually underweight but are attractive because of their proportions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tried so many different types of therapy it's utterly ridiculous. I do take my mental health issues seriously but I'm worse than I have ever been. I used to think about suicide a lot but know I'd never do it but now it makes me feel calmer when I think about jumping. I can't function anymore.. I can barely get myself to class. My moods are all over the place. I hate myself.. My personality, how I look, everything. Im trying to hold out for as long as I can but I feel like this is a hole I truly will never get myself out of. My life will continue being a cycle of me lying to everyone and saying I'm doing better to not worry them and putting on the same mask I do everyday just to function while I'm crumbling inside.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all. Nothing about my life seems positive anymore. The literal ONLY reason I can say I am alive and haven't killed myself yet is because I feel so bad for my father who lost my mother when I was a baby and has gotten himself sick over it (end stage renal failure, type 2 diabetes, a stroke, etc). If I died I know he would die too. 

Somehow here I am, still thinking about just getting it over with and jumping off the parking deck on the end of my block. I go there sometimes and just look over the edge. I used to feel fear when I peered over but now I almost feel calm like looking down at the ground is soothing. 

My life has become a burden to others. My boyfriend and I have issues because I can't get over shitty things that happened in the past, my dad is worried about me because he knows I've been battling mental health issues and now I'm suddenly losing weight, my sister and I pretend that everything's cool between us, and my friends are all skin deep and not people who I truly connect with. Quite honestly I don't feel a connection between anyone anymore besides my boyfriend whom I also resent and my therapist. 

I've tried a string of different things.. One on one, phone coaching, DBT groups, outpatient, hospitalization, and took them all seriously. I thought I made some solid progress but i fell back into my ways. 

I truly want to die and don't know what to do anymore. I tried everything. I don't want to feel this horrible and draining aching pain every single day of my life and feel my only escape is to end my life. Please for the love of god someone help me  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Unless, of course, you are willing to end the relationship over this issue and feel that you two have irreconcilable differences

ok never in this post did i mention having thoughts of/wanting to break up over this! 

also i think saying "I don't think I should dress conservatively just to make my boyfriend feel comfortable" is straight to the point. i am all about compromise, however i feel very strongly about this topic. i would be more than willing to discuss this with him. i wonder where these sudden feelings are coming from and talking to him about it would be worth the discussion. in hopes of letting him know this has nothing to do with him, i would tell him that dressing the way i do is personal and makes me feel good. its not about just putting on a show for other people. 

im frustrated that he went about this in such a way. he ended up storming out of the room and moved to the living room. im giving him time to cool off and will continue thinking about how to approach this to him in a calm and respectful way, while still communicating to him that id like to dress how i want for halloween and it has nothing to do with him!

	<TEXT> ..? my boyfriend very very rarely goes out, which leaves me to go to parties with my girlfriends. therefore, i do get hit on when i go out. i have learned ways to bring my boyfriend into conversation or get myself out of the situation if i feel uncomfortable. i dont need my boyfriend by my side to guard me or something. 

also, ive gotten hit on/cat called wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. in a college town especially, it doesnt really matter what im or other women are wearing, many women dressed down will still attract guys attention.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i get what you mean that maybe he saw going to parties as a way to like meet someone or hookup or something. i never saw it exclusively as that. and when we committed to eachother, partying was a way to de-stress on weekends and dance with my friends and get drunk together. i dont attend frats, only a close friends who is in a tiny one, and go to house parties with many people i know. now that im in my senior year, i want to go to more events because i havent gone to as many in the past two..really only occasionally. 

 or to modify your behavior as a relationship sacrifice

i think i will stick to dressing how i would like, as it really has nothing to do with him to be honest. i do appreciate your input. i honestly wish he would come to parties with me, but he chooses not to. i respect him, but i dont think i should dress more conservatively on halloween just to make my boyfriend feel more comfortable. 


EDIT: we obviously come from different social circles. it makes me sad that your family would shame a woman dressing in skimpy attire. 

based on your original comment, i worried that you equated "dressing slutty" to "being a slut", which is why i clarified! 

i am certainly not ignoring his feelings! its distressing that he's upset about this, which is why i am posting here. id like to understand and figure out a way to go about this situation and make him feel more secure/confident in our relationship where me dressing in a slutty outfit would make him feel proud for having an attractive and confident girlfriend rather than nervous and annoyed that i would choose these clothes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks for your response! I disagree though, and heres why. weve been together for three years, and ive always dressed the way i do. when i go out, i choose more revealing outfits on days where i feel good about myself. nothing has changed, and he never seemed to fuss much about me going to parties and dressing like that. 

EDIT: also, just because he isnt attending the party doesnt mean that i cannot show skin if id like to? Im just thrown off by that. 
EDIT 2: wait wait wait..why would your family members be pulling you aside? i do not just go prancing around at parties in a thong and bra flirting with whomever hits on me. party attire at the school i go to is slutty, but that does not make me a slut </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for this response. I am really trying to work hard on my all or nothing thinking and the want and almost need to *always* be right. This way of thinking has only been causing me extra stress for years. I'm trying to accept what happened I guess. And by accept I don't mean approve of, I'm just trying to say "ok yeah that happened and it was horrible but fixating on it is only gonna hurt me in the long run." It's pretty obvious how bad the things he did hurt me, and I'm sure he does feel really bad about it. So it's really up to me at this point if I can move past it. I have been working on it and posted here kinda in lala land hoping there would be a quick fix to find a way to let myself forgive him, but I realized that I just have to continue working on it and try to just relax and believe him when he says how much he loves me and is honest with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally relate to this so hard. It's hard to tell just how different out bodies look when we look in the mirror every single day lol. Do you have any "before" pics? That helps me see my weightloss a lot clearer  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup. I usually eat something under 200 cal between 2 and 3:30 and then don't eat until at least 7. I hold off for as long as I can. Sometimes I'll just unintentionally fast until dinner time and then I'll have a pretty substantial meal of like 500-600 cal and a snack later on. I'm trying to stick to high calorie restriction because I have been having 2000-3000 calorie binges like every other day. </TEXT>
