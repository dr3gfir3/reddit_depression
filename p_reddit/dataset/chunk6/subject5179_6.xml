	<TEXT> Guys, 

Aware of any game played by good players who have done a proper Turtling (It's ok if it's an Arena game) (possibly even with Bombard Towers erected) and then attacked in Imperial and won the game? Link me or share the game file.

Thank You

	<TEXT> Hi All,

I have done this before (many years back) but right now am really struggling with delivering the car "Job". The cars are basically really bad, with horrible handling and poor acceleration. The Cops surely win the chase and bust me. I can't even use PursuitBreakers as it would damage the cars.

Any suggestion/pointers? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an incredible read. 

"I think Microsoft Game Studios has moved on, and they don't have anyone there who manages their history and back-catalog in matters like these. If for some reason, my last contact finds the opportunity and gets back to me, I would gladly spend my weekends putting together an update, but I'm no longer going to actively pursue it. I've searched for that person who could tell me yeah or nay for over a year but he (or she) is not to be found."

Really sad after reading this. But also excited because the interest is back. This was written 7 years back and who would have thought things will change? Nobody! A game which started development work in 1995 is being discussed and played by loads of people across the globe in 2017. Matt Pritchard. You should be a proud man. I really hope you actually know about it. </TEXT>

And sigh, AoE Online was a complete failure. 

They intended it to have low hardware requirements

Nobody thinks lower hardware reqs nowadays, this was strange!

The game was eventually killed along with it

It was not! ;-)

So, the answer to "Anybody remotely associated to AoE from the original ES team right now?" is NO! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi All

First of all, a very happy new year to my fellow Racers!
I had a query regarding NFS Undercover. Is there a way I can play the game Windowed? I want to capture it on OBS. If the game goes Full Screen (as it is right now), the OBS captures a blank screen. Mind you, OBS successfully captures the cinematic part of the game. 

Any pointers? </TEXT>
