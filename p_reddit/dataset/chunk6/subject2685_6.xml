	<TEXT> Just built mine two days ago.  BIGGEST THING:  keep your boxes organized.  I took out the plastic bags with screws from each and was crazy confused.  Also, two most important pamphlets, (Aside from Tom's Hardware guide) are the instruction booklet from your case and the instruction booklet from your motherboard.  Alternate back and forth to get all cables in the right spaces.  I also went to PC partpicker and searched for builds using my case to see how people configured it when I wanted a clearer picture of how the motherboard was placed to calm my nerves.  Good luck! </TEXT>

**Was looking for general advice of how to get the most of out it now that it's built.**  I use it for gaming, and the only general advice I know of is to download the latest driver's for the graphic cards, which I did.  I hear other stories of how people check to see if all RAM is being used, which I believe is.  Now, if I have general settings set, in the settings menu, will that be capped, or can I push max settings there if the pc is using moderate settings?  Also, what antivirus should I use?  And furthermore, should I be turning my PC off every night?  Looking for some general post-build tips!  Thanks y'all! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> They take out 40%, but they check your email for receipts from NewEgg and Amazon.  They then monitor the item, and if the price drops they use the agreement of sale to get the price difference on deals.  Useful when you use amazon or newegg a lot.  Also, the more you refer, the higher total of money back percentage wise.

My main setup is Export vid to external, then upload to youtube, then eject drive at the end of the session.  I know youtube let's you download your videos back, but god forsake something happens to my account, you know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have backups.  Yeah, this is what i've been thinking.  The second part is whether price is better, as a year of 1TB on drive is $120.  Guessing over the long run, both SSD and google drive storage will be cheaper.  Not sure if I should worry about "future proofing" in terms of storage as buildapc is big on not future proofing. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-04-07 22:32:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Looking for very long term storage to store my videos.  Often each one is 1-2 GB, and my one year old external 2TB HDD is 75% full.  I carry around a backpack with it inside often, and I've had a few HDD become toast due to the traveling lifestyle.  I've been looking at SSD prices but man, they are insanely expensive.  Is it cheaper just to buy 2 TB's of google drive, which is like 5 bucks a year?  Asking because not sure if it is a good investment for the long run because not sure if the SSD will ever become cheaper than google drive.  Please advise y'all. </TEXT>

Would love to expand upon this channel by having some older but interesting works (non-original), and what better place to ask.  Would also be great if there is not yet a reading of the poem.  Love this subreddit, and it's a great place to peruse during any mood.  Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> wow, this is a genius idea.  Thank you!  As a novice, i've been always dumping JSON output in another file and then attempting to parse huge files or clean it.  This is so much better.  Just one question though, i'm confused by the text = MyApi.read(myURL).  I used this, which gives me the parsed selection but then dumps the complete JSON after it.  Obviously i'm missing a small bit.  This is what I have:

     require "tumblr_client"

     client = Tumblr::Client.new :consumer_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
     
     myURL = client.posts 'example.tumblr.com', :type = 'photo', :limit = 1
     
     myURL['posts'].each { |post| puts post['post_url'] }

What am I missing here, where does the **text = MyApi.read(myURL)** come in?  I apologize if this is a frustrating question, but I am really eager to learn this and I am learning a lot from you.  Thank you!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, figured a lot of you have worked with UE4 so thought it would be quicker to ask.  I want to make trees in blender to import, but I wanted to make the scale correctly in blender.  I am basing my game off the default "First Person Shooter" blueprint.  I did a quick bing search and found [this](http://www.worldofleveldesign.com/categories/ue4/ue4-guide-to-scale-dimensions.php) which states the default character height to be 180uu/180cm (approx. 6ft).  Is that true of only the third person scale, or is that also true for the first person perspective? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Voice actor here** with a lot of experience.  In my spare time as a hobby I run a youtube poetry reading channel to keep my skills sharp.

Would love to be a part of your project.  If your game calls for dialogue, grunts, yells, heavy breathing, etc I would be able to send you high quality files of it.  Doing videogame voice acting as a way to further hone my skills for fun. so I am willing to provide audio work at no cost as long as I am credited for my work in the game

Message me if interested! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to receive text from file in Ruby? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Might be an easy question but cant find an andwer by searching for such a specific type. I have a file on the desktop called Data.rb
In it is a bunch of one line texts, and one of the lines says

    Type: "XXXXXX"

How can I tell ruby to look in the file and spit out what's after Type: and between the "'s? I'm sure this is some sort of regex command, but i would end up doing an entire page of code when I know there's a concise way of doing this. Thanks for any input here, it really helps out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We used it for hunting. We would chase animals long distance at a low speed. Animals nearby would sprint when close and they would never get to really eat because of the lack of hands, and we would nonstop be following them.  We could grab a bunch of berries or contain water and eat while we moved. Eventually we won on the endurance front. However, this is good for large game animals that dont fight back like gazelles. Fish, birds and others we couldnt keep up with. Nowadays, it's quicker, safer, and has a wider variety if we just used weapons. </TEXT>
