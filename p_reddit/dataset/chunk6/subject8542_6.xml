	<TEXT> Rewrite the information. This has been my go-to method for years. I type the notes while I'm taking them in class, and then I rewrite them before the test. You focus on the information more carefully when you handwrite it, plus it gives you a chance to use cool highlighter colors and nice pens n stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. If it *was* for hacking Krista's ex boyfriend, he may have realized that it would be easier to just confess to the crime. If he didn't, his personal life and his "hobbies" would have undergone way more scrutiny during a trial and that could have ended very badly for him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did anyone else notice Joanna's boyfriend mention the "stuck-up E Corp party" where they met? I'm wondering if that was the same party where Tyrell killed Sharon. Maybe Joanna's boyfriend has more of a role in the Tyrell drama than we realize? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really think Ray was a case worker. It would make sense for him to spend so much time on the computer, because case workers spend a ton of time logging information during sessions, especially in a prison setting. It would also mean that Ray had alone time with Elliot when he had appointments. His dog may have been a therapy dog; they've become pretty common for mental health workers to keep for comforting their clients. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking he was arrested for hacking the dude that Krista was seeing. He told Krista at one point that he had called the cops on Elliot.  Would also explain why, the first time Elliot saw Krista this season, she said something like "you know it took me a lot to see you again." 

Also, it was just hacking into his social media and email, which would explain why he might have a short sentence.

Edit: grammar   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She sat at his "dinner table" when she came over. So did Gideon. Guessing that was the equivalent of the visiting lobby.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He logged into Ray's computer as "CARETAKER" at one point. Pretty sure he was a case manager or something along those lines.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Journals and a couple of good pens are always a nice gift. Bookstores and craft stores typically have really pretty ones. You could also write a little note on the inside cover.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try the library, or your English department. My university has a group of English students who have designated "office hours" in the library and they'll advise you on academic essays free of charge. This is pretty common at most colleges, you just have to know where to look! </TEXT>
