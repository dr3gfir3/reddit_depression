	<TEXT> **Krolothrai** are humanoid in shape, but giantesque in that they grow to a height of nine to ten feet. Broad of shoulder, they are a bestial-looking people from the Frontier Bivouac of Meteor Fall (northernmost continent). Their usual attire consists of bones, leathers, scales, feathers, and quills. All taken from the reptiles, quilled/furred drakes, and wyverns native to Meteor Fall.

The Krolothrai see technology as a natural extension of human ingenuity. To them, the use of and development of technology, is an extension of Nature's Will. Krolothrai gather technology by departing Meteor Falls and wandering the world, serving in foreign armies, mercenary companies, mining companies.

Their spiritual focus is around gaining strength by devouring the fallen - the carnivore is nourished while the prey is returned to the earth. From this return, the prey may be reborn. Typically oozes native to Meteor Fall will scavenge the remains - these oozes are used to brew aphrodisiacs, so the belief is that the newborns of the Krolothrai are the fallen, reincarnated.  </TEXT>

I was making conversation to pass the time with a couple of acquaintances. Stuff like what did you do over Christmas...I got into an embarrassing fly fishing story. Girl in the group abruptly asks, "so, are you seeing anyone?" after I mentioned a nasty mishap with my line. It sounded like a strange question so I just kinda said "Uh, not at the moment," and went on with my story.

So my question is - is this one of them there things saying "ask me out for drinks?" I didn't know if it was that or just a shot at starting a new line of conversation while we killed time.  </TEXT>

Hellkite's traditionally been there to deal with souls. Perhaps if Abzan/Junk becomes the preferred midrange - and you wanna stick with Jund - you'd consider Hellkite.

	<DATE> 2017-01-10 05:16:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Something I'm aiming to do in my worldbuilding is avoid the noble savage with my more primitive-looking tribes. In looking for inspiration, I've turned to Steven Erikson's Barghast from the Malazan Book of the Fallen Series:

* Barghast initially presented as a broad-n-burly warrior bunch that're fighting for their beast gods.

* Barghast believe in a prophesied final battle against a great enemy.

* A queen takes a Barghast tribesman as a lover, gets kind of uppity; Barghast tribesman makes a joke about hobbling her for being uppity if she belonged to him (we later see a hobbling; its horrific, but its not done to the queen in my example).

Is this a good way of avoiding the noble savage? This tribe's got its warriorlike ways, driven by a warriorlike quest based in prophecy, but also possess some customs that we would see as savage and inhumane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Myth**

Five Primeval Dragons crawled from the cold, dark depths of space - they were **Reshrith the White Wolf**, **Salaxlotl the Salamander**, **Hydrark the Serpent**, **Flydevi the Storm**, and **Axhru the Axe** - and fought with Primordial Elementals in vast cities built by the Primordials. Their battle was focused around the **Solar Heart** - a sun approaching a supernova.

At the battle's height the sun exploded, consuming Primeval and Primordial alike. Those that survived found themselves on a world birthed from the explosion.

**Reality**

There were five races of Primeval Dragon resembling the legendary Primevals - **Reshrith**, **Salaxlotl**, **Flydevi**, **Hydrark** and **Axhu**. Individual dragons from each of these races were drawn to a ring of ruined planets surrounding the sun. Across the ruins they found suitable prey, hunted it to extinction, and turned on one another. Their fighting released enough energy to trigger a Big Bang.

From the Big Bang came my world, where the offspring of these five Primeval races were left to contend with the new world's innate defense system: great elementals that have since been described as Primordials, for their size, power, and command of the planet's various defense mechanisms ie magic. 

Notably, the dragons didn't come from no where - they were descended from an older founding race called the Foreshi. The Foreshi, along with the Progenti, Engineers, and Shifters once inhabited the ring of ruined planets to which the Primeval Dragon races were drawn. An innate migratory instinct is likely what brought the Primevals back to the wrecked home of their ancestors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hot springs in Demon Wind's HQ, combined with its marshland locale, have given his higher-ups a very distinctive look. They're very pallid, with fungi growing from their skin. Demon Wind's people are human, mind you.

Demon Wind was inspired by Sao Feng and his Singapore hideout from Pirates: At World's End.

	<TEXT> Dragonborn - you get sick, your normally atavistic fellow dragonborn will sniff you out and fight over you. The winner's gonna end your suffering and take your remains for their necroburner magic.

Naga - you'll end up a sacrifice to the Bloodfolk if we're talking the naga from Shadow; or, you'll simply get thrown out of the mountain lair and left to fend for yourself if you're a naga from Eberrai.

Shifters - they care for their sick. If its terminal, the individual suffering is taken to the druids and used as a pharmacy guineapig for the druids' research. It is for the good of the tribe - and their beliefs in reincarnation say that death simply sows the soul, so that a new Shifter may grow from the forest's soil. </TEXT>

edit - I think Moorcock's Melniboneans might work - they've all about chaos, but mostly keep it to themselves after having used their dragons and magic to create a massive, but rapidly declining, empire. They're smart enough to work trade deals with the world around then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Meteorfall** - This claims that a red meteor - the hardened wings of Primeval Salaxlotl - crashed on barren strip of land floating in space. From this impact came waters that carved up the land, bringing with it the potential for new life. It is a creation myth from the northernmost continent, Meteor Fall.

**Sandstorm** - This legend is one that all the children from the continent Shadow are taught at a young age. It is said that Primeval Flydevi created an army of sand elementals, razing the magnificent temples of the Bloodfolk. After which, Flydevi used the winds to blow seeds and pollen from across the sea into the barren wastes of Shadow, creating a beautiful continent of temple gardens and ruined cities filled with a variety of vibrant flora.

	<TEXT> Shifters are the closes I've got to dogs. They're essentially lycanthropes that have a blend of mammalian features - rat, jackal, wolf rolled into one. They came about when some crazy ifrits conspired with their djinn kin to create an ice-age with the intent of using the cold to exterminate the dragonborn. Dragonborn magic gave primitive man the ability to shift into this bestial form to adapt to the magically-induced ice age.
