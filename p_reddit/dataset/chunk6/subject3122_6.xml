Really, though...whether it's creating barriers to minority voting, imposing his religious beliefs on women who don't share them, and denigrating LGBT Americans, Jeff Sessions is a relic of a bygone era when whites ruled supreme over the nation. The propaganda in this article ignore factual information about very questionable and worrisome beliefs and behaviors on Sessions' part. He shouldn't be in charge of anything, let alone the Justice Department.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How about unionizing? If your university tolerates outright bullying, students have a clear incentive to seek protection through unionization. My university recently considered a union drive. One of the anti-union positions was that the University already had an excellent track record of treating graduate students well in their capacity as workers. However you feel about that argument, it's clear that your university is not that way. 

Alternatively, you can speak to an administrator outside the department. A Dean, for example, is in a good position to deal with this issue. 

Keep in mind, however, that all of these potential actions are risky. Academic hazing is a systemic issue. Many of us went through it to some degree, and we all know it goes on. Making waves could get you branded a troublemaker. This could limit job options, lab transfer options, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a disconnect between what the responses have been here and your apparent understanding of those responses. People here are telling you that the assessment of cheating is independent of the quality of the paper. You are asserting that the accusation of cheating is an indication of the quality of the paper. While we all understand how upsetting it is to fail a class, the fact of the matter is that you need to set aside your personal thoughts about the quality of the paper and deal with the fact that your paper has been judged as being of relatively low quality (below 65%, as you say in one of your comments). Nothing you say will change what the person grading your paper has said about the quality of your work.

This may difficult to reconcile. I'll give you an example of how this can happen. A paper may raise concerns with a professor for using vocabulary which the professor doesn't think the student knows based on their interactions. The vocabulary would indicate cheating. That vocabulary may be used poorly, however, and the structure of the paper could still be terrible. The professor, however, would stop reading at the point the vocabulary issue came up. Your assignment was a literature review. The comparable case for you would be that you did a good job of assembling the material but did very little to synthesize the material, show a deep understanding of how the literature is interrelated, or otherwise achieve the goals of the assignment. The lack of analysis would mean that your paper would sound like the papers you cite, and the paper would be of low quality. Your response to my comment should not be "no, and here's why you're wrong." Again, your thoughts on the quality of your work are immaterial given that a grade has been assigned. 

This doesn't mean you don't have recourse. You could appeal to the Dean and ask for additional information (i.e. feedback, a graded copy of the paper, etc.) to better understand the decision. You could also request an additional person grade the paper given the rather difficult circumstances. I would approach asking for these things in a matter-of-fact manner rather than using emotion. Your grade is your grade, not a matter for negotiation or emotion. At the end of the day, this may not be resolved in your favor. 

Edit: I intended to wish you well at the end of the post. I hope that you work out something that benefits you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reading this article and the related commentary is positively infuriating. As a liberal, I loved watching all of the garbage poll unskewing that Republican commentators engaged in. The idea that Nate Silver is being maligned and accused of such behavior is beyond the pale. It's even more galling when you consider the source: the fucking Huffington Post, a true liberal equivalent of Fox News. Sure, it's fun to read that stuff if you want to feel good, but it's not "nutritious." 

The fact of the matter is that Nate Silver has consistently had a more cautious model incorporating higher levels of uncertainty compared to Sam Wang over the past few cycles. This is a feature, not a bug. It reflects the small sample size of elections to base poll behavior projections on, along with uncertainty related to undecided and third party voters. He provides ongoing discussions of his model and thoughtful commentary about the election and potential outcome scenarios. Sam Wang also does these things, but his model is clearly less cautious. Personally, is rather have a cautious model than an overconfident one...cautious models motivate voters to vote on all sides, something we should want as a society. 

Get an advanced degree in statistics and then you can criticize him. Sam Wang may disagree on the methodology, but I know for certain he wouldn't malign Nate Silver's bona fides. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is exactly the type of bloviation mentioned in the article here. Your comment is premised on the idea that Nate Silver assigns the probability on a day-to-day basis. In fact, his mode remains little changed from what he used to predict the last two presidential elections. What's different this time is there are two third-party candidates which leads his model to build in higher levels of outcome uncertainty. 

If you were to read the various commentaries he offers on the model, you'd understand these things. Even when his model showed an 84% chance of her winning, he was talking about why third party strength and poll variance made that 16% a non-negligible amount of variation compared to Obama's probability with a similar lead in the polls back in 2012. He likened a 16% chance to "the chance of winning (or getting shot during) a game of Russian Roulette." 

Instead, people try to take the model probabilities and interpret them in isolation or without a firm understanding of what they represent. He's not hedging at any percentage, he's making an empirical observation of outcome uncertainty based on poll data and what he considers to be appropriate trend adjustments. He's fully transparent about the fact that he does this adjustment, along with disclosing his poll adjustments in a per-poll basis. He also acknowledges, in these commentaries, most of the the things that this article points out about early voting and what not. His discussion of why he doesn't include early voting is actually quite interesting if you take the time to seek it out and read it. 

Tl;dr - You can't act like insert anti-science political part here and deny reality when your liberal statistical idol suddenly has his model come up with conservative estimates. Learn more, behave better! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose the question here is whether there is broad agreement on the appropriateness of smoothing for the purpose of trend line adjustment. 538 clearly makes use of this type of adjustment, but why don't other poll aggregators (if indeed they don't)? 

It seems to me that some sort of smoothly parameter is appropriate given that old polls will not reflect the effects of news on current voting intentions. Once you accept that premise, the argument over the appropriate smoothing parameter or method becomes the primary discussion. Granted, this can become a very contentious point of discussion. Still, it leaves other pollsters who don't adjust for trend lines in the indefensible position of using poorly constructed models.

	<TEXT> My assertion of the number of estimates was also arbitrary. I wouldn't just use an estimate like that arbitrarily in practice, however. I selected it based on a desire to keep the task under 30 minutes total. Assuming 30-45 seconds per estimate, I figure that would fit in along with the required demographic questions and other reported measures used in the study. I'd then have an RA act as a participant in order to see if my assumptions are reasonable. Then I'd pilot test the experiment before running it in full to ensure that the results are promising enough to warrant a full experiment. If I got marginally significant results, for example, I might consider adjusting the number of estimates depending on whether I thought fatigue was setting in or more days might help separate the "signal from the noise."

Edit: While the science underpins the theory and predictions, the experimental design can be a bit of an art, in my opinion. It takes some trial and error to determine how many estimates you'll need, but experience can give you a better starting point and tighten up how long it takes to arrive at the right estimate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will second this information, but from the perspective of someone who knows a bit about academic labor markets. Philosophy is the first field I think of when I think "why would someone pursue that PhD?" It's not that I have no respect for the field...I've taken a number of philosophy course which have had a substantive impact on my life and research. The work is important and contributes greatly to society. 

The fact is that the market-based functions which have been gradually imposed on universities have placed them at the mercy of both students and market economics. Small class sizes make it impractical to hire research-active philosophy professors, who need course release time to do good work. Students who might have viewed philosophy as a way to prepare for graduate school in law or the humanities are instead choosing "flashier" courses of study (I'll avoid mentioning names). Resources instead go to professional programs and business schools which teach bigger average classes and attract more students. That's in addition to the other frivolous expenditures mentioned above. 

The end result can be seen by looking at a random urban community college philosophy faculty group. LaGuardia Community College has two tenure-track professors with PhDs from top-15 philosophy phd programs (NYU and Memphis). More importantly, almost all of them have PhDs. Compare this to a field with a heathy job market and you'll find a CC department filled with Master's degrees instead with possibly a single PhD. These jobs basically have no significant research requirement to get tenure, instead loading up professors with 4 or 5 courses per semester. Pay is low...I know high school teachers who make more than community college professors, quite frankly. 

That's all assuming the rosy scenario where you get any sort of tenure track job. The odds are against that, in which case you're left to cobble together a meager living in academia by teaching multiple courses at multiple universities per semester on a contingent bases. It's all too dreary to adequately describe in a Reddit post. 

If we can convince just you, OP, to not pursue a philosophy PhD and a subsequent academic career, I'll consider it a triumph! If you pursue the PhD anyway, I'll consider it a success if you do so only with full funding and the knowledge that you won't be a professor afterward.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my PhD cohort, one student was asked to leave at the end of the first semester. Another classmate described the circumstances aptly, saying "Some people are weak in one area and strong in others. She was weak in everything!" I know at least one student in each subsequent cohort who left under similar circumstances. Basically, it quickly became clear they wouldn't be able to succeed in the program due to a lack of requisite skills (quantitative, writing, etc.) and they were asked to leave. In each case, the lack of skills was evidenced by multiple C/D/F grades. The first girl got an F and 2 Ds, another got a D and 2 Cs. Sub-B grades are a good indicator of sub-par performance, and multiple such grades should give you pause. This may be just the norms of my school, but I don't think so...it jives with what others have said about their schools. 

You know your performance better than others, however. Take the time to look at your performance and consider if you are lacking in one or more critical skills. Are your grades sub-B? Are you getting a lot of negative feedback? Don't just fade away...talk to your professors. They aren't going to be shy about sharing their assessment of your work, believe me. 

Edit: that grade threshold also held for my master's program. Sub-B grades in master's programs are, in my view and the view of a number of my colleagues, as good as failing grades.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You make a very good point about a control group. Because the experiment is using an estimation task which may be subject to learning effects, you want to make sure that what you're observing is attributable to the intervention and not to learning to estimate better over the course of the experiment. 

In terms of how many estimates should be required, I would have said 10 pre and 10 post. If you could get more estimates, like 15-20, you may even be able to rule out learning effects by showing no appreciable difference in accuracy within the pre-test period. That could support you not having a control group, though I still think one is preferred for this type of study.

	<TEXT> Perhaps the point your professor is, trying to make, however inartfully, is that economic models flopped in the period surrounding the 2008 recession. The assumptions built into the models were sufficiently unrealistic as to render them useful for predicting the recession which occurred. For example, one assumption in the models of the time involved the availability of unlimited amounts of credit. A huge issue during the period just prior to the recession, however, was the subprime mortgage crisis. Credit basically dried up a banks tried to maintain capital levels and avoid lending money to people with dubious creditworthiness. They didn't account for the role of regulation in the drying up of credit as banks couldn't demand a sufficiently high risk premium from certain classes of borrowers due to maximum interest rate restrictions. They also didn't account for a variety of externalities, including bank default, which were a significant factor in the recession and in destabilizing the economic system. 

How does this lead them to share some blame for the recession? Had these models been more realistic, regulators might have behaved differently prior to the recession in ways that might have headed off the worst of the recession. The fact that we now have bank stress tests and higher levels of regulatory capital requirements are a direct reflection of the refinement of our economic models in the wake of the financial crisis. Had they performed better during the crisis, we still may have been able to better deal with the recession once it hit. Granted, the intransigence of Congress, particularly the decision to limit Government spending at a time when prior Governments would have expanded such spending, were a more direct cause of the persistence of the recession (in my opinion and in the opinion of economists like Paul Krugman) than simple model error. Nevertheless, better functioning models may have done a better job at convincing Congress to initiate Government spending. 

tl;dr - The models are to blame because they didn't head off the recession or prepare us to deal with it once it arrived.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah...I don't know about that. This is a case where you need to just keep speaking up until there is a resolution. If she keeps making you all study garbage and the administration won't stop her, go to the media. If she retaliates, go to the principal then the superintendent. Keep your parents closely in the loop as you need their support against an adult with power over you. This lady doesn't belong in a classroom...she should be working for Jill Stein.

	<TEXT> Hopping on the top comment to ask what I think is a pertinent question. Do these folks normally endorse presidential candidate? I mean, I know that nobody goes around touting a KKK endorsement...that's just good sense. But who does the KKK normally endorse? I'd be interested to know if they usually endorse the Republican.

I could just look it up, but I think it's better to ask the question and read the inevitable jokes that will follow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the best thing you can do to help your roommate is move out and leave him to find a decent human being to live with. Between your casual slut shaming, misogyny, lack of empathy, and the way you seem to look forward to abusing underlings in the same way you are currently being abused, you sound kind of insufferable. 

Your roommate sounds like he's in a bit of a mental state and clearly needs some help, but you don't sound like you have a sufficient amount of "give a shit" to actually help. It sounds like you want him to feel better because he's inconveniencing you by being drunk and sad. That's certainly fine that you aren't able to lead him to a better mental place...we aren't all equipped to help people with their emotional issues. Own that and butt out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're thinking of government work and plan on getting the 5th-year Masters so you can take the CPA (depending on jurisdiction), consider the Presidential Management Fellowship program. They put people into mid-level positions with special management development programs to help them move into positions of higher authority. I considered it before I went for my PhD and found they just didn't get enough recruits from the business fields. It's an area of need and I had a lot of interest across agencies. The salaries are decent (though the upside potential is clearly well below that of industry), and they offer perks like student loan repayment support.  </TEXT>
