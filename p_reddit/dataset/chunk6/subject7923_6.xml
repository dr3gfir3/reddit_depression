	<TEXT> The kiwis I used were pretty ripe, so they were super sweet. BUT, kiwis, in general, are also tart. I personally thought there was a bit too much tartness for the sweetness of the whipped cream and sponge. However, other people who ate it thought it tasted fine. I think putting in other fruits (like strawberry) would have made it great. Fruit, overall, provide a nice freshness against the creaminess of the whipped cream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The smoothness you always see is because they're mousse cakes and are set in a silicone mold. You could coat your cake with a buttercream or whipped cream or whatever you like to make it smooth.  
If the glaze is brought down in temp too much (room temp is too cold), it will probably harden before falling completely dripping off. Next time just give the glaze a quick zap in the microwave if it is not dripping fast enough/ completely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/doyoueven_reddit,   
Here's the recipe. It looks long, but it's not too bad. You need to have two different sized silicon or other dome shaped molds if want this shape. Otherwise, you can pretty much use whatever you have, as long as you think you can demold it. The mousse, cake, and gel are super tasty together and will work in any setting.  
There are four main components: a jaconde sponge (an almondy sponge), a mango mousse, a mango gel, and a mirror glaze. The decorations are some food coloring and some tempered dark chocolate (double boiler: heat to 115F -- take off heat and add a few chocolate chips-- stir/ add chocolate until 83F -- heat back to 90F).  
 nbsp;  
**1. Mango Gele:**  
4.5 g gelatin (+ about 15 g water to bloom)    
100 g mango puree (sieved)
50 g water  
30 g sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Bloom gelatin. Stir water into gelatin to get apple sauce consistency.  
2. Heat the mango puree, water and sugar in a small saucepan and dissolve sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Remove from heat and add the gelatin. Mix.  
4. Cool a bit and then pour into a small half sphere mold. Freeze.  
 nbsp;  
**2. Jaconde Sponge:**  
70 g almond flour  
70 g powdered sugar   
70 g egg yolk  
30 g egg white (1)   
130 g egg white (2)   
45 g sugar  
70 g flour  
25 g melted butter  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 440F. Get a sheet pan and lie down some parchment paper or silpat.  
2. Mix sifted almond flour and powdered sugar.  
3. To that same bowl, add the yolks and the whites (1) and beat until smooth.   
4. Add the sifted flour.  
5. Make a meringue by whisking the second egg whites (2) with the sugar to stiff peaks. First bring egg whites (2) to a foam, then slowly incorporate the sugar.   
6. Fold about half the meringue into the batter, then add the butter and stir.  
7. Fold in the remainder of the meringue.  
8. Pour the batter onto your baking sheet and spread it out to an even layer.  
9. Bake for 6 minutes, give or take. Use a toothpick to make sure the batter has cooked.  
10. Cool cake and cut out whatever shape you need. I used round cookie cutters to be the bases of my dome cakes.  
 nbsp;  
**3. Mango Mousse:**  
90 g heavy cream     
115 g mango puree (sieved)  
3.5 g gelatin (+ about 15 g water to bloom)      
30 g Italian meringue **  
**  
15 g water  
60g sugar  
30 g egg white  
 nbsp;  
1. Bloom the gelatin. Stir water into gelatin to get an apple sauce like consistency.    
2. Heat the mango puree over medium heat and dissolve the bloomed gelatin in it. Pour in a bowl and leave to cool (the fridge helps to expedite).     
3. Prepare the Italian meringue:   
a. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water.  
b. On low and stirring occasionally, cook the syrup.   
c. Start whisking the egg whites until foaming.   
d. When the syrup reaches 240F, remove the saucepan from the heat pour in a thin stream, while whisking the egg white. Whisk to stiff peaks.    
4. Whip the cream. Prechilled bowl and whisk speed up the process.  
5. Fold in meringue into the puree/gelatin (make sure its not warm).   
6. Fold in the whipped cream into that mixture.     
 nbsp;  
**Assembly:**  
1. Add mousse into a piping bag and then pipe a bit into a larger dome mold.  
2. Demold the frozen mango gel from the smaller mold and push into the mousse you piped in.   
3. Top with the cutout of the sponge.  
4. Freeze.  
 nbsp;  
**4. Mirror Glaze:**  
100 g white chocolate   
35 g condensed milk  
50 g sugar  
61.25 g corn syrup  
25 ml water  
4 g gelatin (+ about 15 ml water to bloom)  
 nbsp;  
1. Mix gelatin in water until you get an apple sauce consistency.  
2. In a small pot add corn syrup, water, and sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Add in gelatin and condensed milk. Whisk until gelatin fully dissolved.  
4. In a bowl with the chocolate, add the liquid mixture and whisk until chocolate is fully melted. If you have a hand blender, I highly recommend that you use it to blend the chocolate.   
5. Portion off and add desired food coloring. Do some more hand blending.  
6. Bring the glaze to about a bit warmer than room temp (85F to 100F is probably okay [30C - 37C]).  
 nbsp;  
**Final Decoration:**  
1. After the cakes have set, remove from mold and set it on top of a drying rack on top of a sheet pan for easy clean up.  
2. Pour glaze over dome cakes creating desired designs with other color glazes.  
3. Let the glaze fully drip off. Clean off the surplus drips on the bottom of the cake and then transfer to a serving plate.  
4. Garnish with whatever other fancy stuff you want.  
a. I used some food coloring splattered with a paint brush and some tempered chocolate cut up into bits and into little rectangles.  You can really do whatever though and it'll look good.  
5. Freeze or refrigerate. The mousse tastes better when its not frozen, but even then, still good!  
 nbsp;  
*Additional notes:*  
1. Unless you have a blast freezer, it'll take a few days to make, so plan accordingly.  
2. I talk about silicone half sphere molds here. But anything would work. Just be cognizant to not put hot things on frozen things, for obvious reasons.  
3. You can adapt for whatever fruit you like for the gel and mousse. The mousse on its own also tastes great. You may want to reduce the amount of puree if you want it to be a thicker consistency.    
4. For a chocolate jaconde sponge, instead use 55 g of flour and 20 g of cocoa powder.  
 nbsp;  
Enjoy!

	<TEXT> /u/seattlesloth,  
So this was actually supposed to have more raspberry batter, but I ended up putting more matcha batter in. Hence, the filling looks mostly green. I'll just post the recipe for a matcha dark chocolate cake. If you want a raspberry one or a mixed matcha raspberry one, just make some raspberry batter and put some some  in. *[For the raspberry base, you want to use 20 g butter and 30 g raspberry puree (add after mixing the egg, before flour).]*    
This dessert has four components. The dark chocolate base, matcha base, almond crumb, and matcha ice cream. Lava cakes are super easy to make and everyone thinks they're fancy. You should definitely try it at least once. You'll need ramekins.  
 nbsp;  
**Lava Cake bases:** *[about 2 small ramekins per base, so 2 bases = 4 ramekins]*  
***1. Dark Chocolate base***  
69 g dark chocolate   
40 g butter  
40 g sugar  
1 egg  
25 g flour  
 nbsp;  
***2. Matcha White Chocolate base:***  
69 g dark chocolate   
40 g butter + a bit to coat the ramekins  
40 g sugar  
1 egg  
25 g flour  
5 g matcha powder, sifted   
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 450F.  
2. Melt chocolate and butter over a double boiler.  
3. Take off double boiler. Stir in sugar and mix until smooth. Depending on your white chocolate, it may be lumpy ish..that's okay though since it'll smooth out after adding the egg.   
4. Add egg. Mix until smooth.  
5. Sift in flour (or add presifted flour). For matcha base, first whisk together flour and matcha before adding. Stir until smooth.  
6. If the batter is runny, chill in the fridge or freezer for 20 minutes to firm. Add to a piping bag.  
7. Coat ramekins with butter. Be extremely generous. The last thing you want is for your lava cake to be stuck when trying to unmold.  
8. Pipe the chocolate base (I go in swirls from edge to center inward and then vertically along the sides) to "coat" the ramekin. If your batter isn't thick, you need to work quickly and hurry and go to the next step.  
9. Pipe in some of the matcha base inside of this chocolate coating.  
10. Finally cover up the matcha base with more chocolate base. Chill in fridge for a bit (10 - 15min is probably fine).  
11. Bake for 9 - 10 minutes. You should see that the top of the lava cake no longer has a wet looking center. Watch it carefully starting at around 8.5 minutes. I carefully scrape along the sides of the ramekin and then put a plate on top and flip over.   
 nbsp;  
Try a single tester one first to see if it's able to come out nicely. If too runny, go for another minute and if it isn't runny at all, then bake for less.    
 nbsp;  
**3. Almond Crumb:**  
35 g almond flour  
35 g sugar  
25 g butter  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat over to 400F. (Any temp works actually, you just need to check it to make sure it doesn't burn.)  
2. Combine ingredients in a food processor. Mixing by hand also works, but you need to work harder. You want a cookie dough consistency.  
3. Spread the dough over a silpat or parchment paper to make a thin layer.  
4. Bake for 10-20 minutes. Check back often so that it doesn't burn. Take to your own desired level of browness. Initially, you'll see the butter sort of bubbling, but shortly after that it starts to harden. I use a fork to mix the crumb as it's baking.  
5. I cool the crumb/ cookie for a short time and then put it in a cup and smash it up with a spoon. You could also throw it into a processor and blitz it up.  
 nbsp;  
**4. Matcha No Churn Ice Cream:**   
396 g (14 oz can) condensed milk  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
pinch of salt  
470 g heavy whipping cream  
15 g matcha powder, sifted  
 nbsp;  
1. Chill bowl and whisk that you're going to use to whip whipping cream.  
2. Whip the whipping cream and add the matcha powder a bit before you reach stiff peaks. Take to stiff peaks.   
3. Whisk in the condensed milk.  
4. Pour into a container and freeze for several hours.  
*Note:* I found that the ice cream had a weird consistency after a day of freezing, so I blended the frozen mixture and then refroze it. It had a much nicer consistency after that.  
OR if you want to be lazy, you can just buy some vanilla ice cream and mix in some matcha powder and refreeze.  
 nbsp;  
Gluck and enjoy! These lava cakes are honestly super easy to make and taste phenomenally. If you don't want a filling in it, then just make lots of the chocolate batter and bake that.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Omnom. Just made some flan cream puffs and I never realized how easy flan was to make :o!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/ept91,  
Mmkay, so right off the bat the vision I had in my head was that I could make flan and then blend it into a thick custard that I could then pipe into the cream puffs. As I mentioned, this won't work. It will basically return it to a liquid, a thick liquid..but definitely not pipeable. At this point, I was like "incorporate it into a whipped cream!," but then I added basically way too much flan liquid and had to do a subsequent whipped cream incorporation to get a consistency that was okay. Below I'll list something that I'm sure will work way better.  
There are three components for this recipe. The choux pastry, the flan /caramel, and whipped cream filling. I used the recipe from [Allrecipes](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/20979/spanish-flan/) for the flan.    
 nbsp;  
**1. Choux pastry: [for about 25-30 cream puffs]**  
200 g water  
125 g milk  
112 g butter (stick, cut into small pieces)  
4 g salt  
4 g sugar  
150 g flour  
4 eggs  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 400F.  
2. Add milk, water, butter, sugar, and salt into a saucepan and bring to boil. You want your butter to have melted prior to boiling, so make sure you cut up the stick of butter into small pieces.  
3. Take the saucepan off the heat, and add in the flour. Stir in (wooden spoon is best) the flour until everything comes together into a ball.  
4. Return to heat and stir vigorously until you start to see some dried residue on the side (~2-3 minutes). Sometimes if I'm not sure, I just stir for longer. In my experience, having less liquid in that dough hasn't been an issue.  
5. Transfer the dough into a bowl and beat until steam no longer rises. If it's in a stand mixer, until the bowl is no longer hot to the touch. You don't want to scramble your eggs that you're about to incorporate.    
6. One at a time, beat in the eggs. Be patient and don't add them all at once.  
7. Dough/ batter should now be a bit droopy. Add to a piping bag with a large round tip.  
8. Pipe you desired size onto a silpat or parchment paper (though, silpats are awesome and everyone should use them).  
9. Grab a small bowl of water and using your finger dipped in water, flatten all the points which resulted from piping them. Those little points will burn in the oven, so flatten those and any other pointy edges which may be on your silpat.  
10. Bake until the cream puffs are golden brown (~30 minutes). Opening the oven/ taking them out before this will cause them to collapse on themselves. You want the puffs to form a solid structure.  
11. After a light golden brown, I take out the tray and stab holes in the bottom of all the puffs using a chopstick. I'm sure there are better ways to do this.    
12. I drop the temp down to 300ish F and put the chopstick stabbed puffs back into the oven to allow the insides to dry out. Usually I leave them in for another 15 minutes. I eat a sample one and if it's still doughy inside, I leave it for longer.  
13. Let cool.  
 nbsp;  
**2. Flan:**  
200 g sugar (though you can definitely get away with less)  
3 eggs  
1 can evaporated milk (12 fl oz)  
1 can sweetened condensed milk (14 fl oz)  
a bit of vanilla extract if you want  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 350F.  
2. Make your caramel by adding the sugar into a saucepan and letting it heat up over low-medium heat. Melt until fully liquefied and golden. Do not stir it constantly, as this will cause the caramel to seize. With your caramel, add to the bottom of your flan dish/ ramekins. Save a little bit of caramel to swirl into the filling.     
3. In a large bowl, beat the eggs.  
4. Add and beat in evaporated milk and vanilla and then condensed milk until you get a smooth mixture.  
5. Pour the mixture into your dish/ ramekins, about 2/3 filled.  
6. Heat up some water and stop before boiling. Add to a deep roasting pan and put your flan dish/ ramekins into the water bath. About half way up the sides of the flan dishes is good.  
7. Bake in the oven for about 40-60 minutes until set.  
 nbsp;  
**3. Flan whipped cream filling:**  
1/3 of the flan your prepared  
set aside caramel + a little extra cream    
300 g heavy cream  
 nbsp;  
1. Throw mixing bowl and whisk that you're going to make the whipped cream in into the fridge. Cold helps the whipping process.    
2. Add a small amount of cream (this will vary depending on how much caramel you set aside, but a tbsp is probably sufficient) to the caramel, which has probably solidified. Throw in the microwave for 30 seconds and stir everything together. You should have a nice caramel sauce. Let cool (a quick time in the fridge speeds up the process, but don't let it harden!).  
3. Take the flan and blend together. I used a hand blender. They make everything better. At this point it should have reverted back into a thick liquid. Throw it in the fridge/ freezer to cool.  
4. Add the heavy cream to the chilled bowl and whisk until stiff peaks. Don't be afraid to take it pretty far.  
5. Fold in some chilled blended flan mixture to the whipped cream. You need to use your judgement here. My issue when I made this was that I added it all to the whipped cream and made the entire mixture too soft. Keep folding in more flan mixture until you start noticing the stiff peaks are being soft.  
6. Take the caramel sauce and swirl it into the mixture.  
7. Add to a piping bag and pipe into chopstick hole of the room temperature puffs when ready to serve. Warm puffs will melt the filling. Don't fill the night before. They will get soggy.  
 nbsp;  
*Main Takeaways + Tips*  
1. I baked the flan because I really wanted to get the flavor into the filling and there were raw eggs in the mixture, so I couldn't just incorporate that. Turns out the eggs don't add that much taste. The predominant taste from the blended flan was condensed milk.  
2. SO, to save yourself the step of baking flan (though, it is super tasty!), you can just make some whipped cream and fold in/ whisk in some condensed milk. Adding in that final swirl of caramel should replicate the taste of flan pretty well without having to go through the actual flan step.  
3. Packaged powder flan is also a good bet. A few months ago, I made a whipped cream and added the powdered flan and the caramel sauce it came with and it tasted great. This is also an option.  
 nbsp;  
Whatever you choose, gluck! I use this choux pastry recipe for all my cream puffs and eclairs. It has served me well and hopefully it does the same for you!     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha. They were such a pain to fill lol. I was honestly so happy as soon as I finished piping my 15th ish/ last one. :P. Protip: blending a baked flan will basically return it to a liquid. Lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been wanting to try this for a while. Finally got around to executing it. Making a flan and converting it into a filling turned out harder than I expected since I made some errors from the get-go. Still tasty :p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, I have. It works quite well for tart fruits like raspberries since the freeze dried fruits are packed with flavor. But I get lazy, so I haven't done it in a while. Just subtract however many grams of fruit powder from the amount of powdered sugar you're using.  
But yea, I'm lazy which is also why I do the French method lol. I usually start making them when I get home at 8:30 or 9pm. And it takes about an hour an a half from start to clean up for a small batch of macarons. These mango ones took a little longer since I had to paint the shells. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> :(. If your meringue isn't stiff enough to begin with you can suffer from this. Also, hmm. At one point is your batter thick? If you fold too much, you can deflate the batter too much. But yes, the only time my batter has been too thin is if I overmixed or if my meringue was not stuff enough to begin with. </TEXT>
