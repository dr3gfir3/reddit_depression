	<TEXT> It may have something to do with gender as well. This is super anecdotal, but of my past and present female friends, rather few have ONSs as a rule, but probably half the time those developed into something more. Of my male friends and acquaintances who have/had ONSs, it seems to very seldom progress beyond that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Though music can be an amazing experience in itself, since I started meditating more seriously, I find I neither want nor need music on "in the background" nearly as much as before. Using music as a distraction from your thoughts is antithetical to real mindfulness, as is being glued to a smartphone. Acknowledging that you're "addicted" is important and speaks to how it may be something you should try to let go of. 
Maybe an important question is why you need to be distracted. And are you meditating regularly? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Blech.

**(Warning: Purity Plot Spoilers in the following wall of text)**

Critics have dislocated their shoulders throwing expectations on this man and then get upset when his latest novel was not the Great American Novel of the Decade. They measure him next to Dostoyevsky, using a stick they keep neatly up their rectum. If you don't do those things, and enjoy his style of writing, you're the type of person who should read Franzen. But haters gon hate.
 
The criticisms levied in this blog really don't resonate with me. For one, I feel like Sandy English, whoever s/he is, missed the point of the political components to this novel compared to, say, *Freedom*. The politics in *Freedom* (easily one of my favourite novels) were a core element to the narrative, whereas in *Purity* it was more like a moderately key element to the setting. This wasn't really a novel about cyberleaks, or Communist or post-Communist Europe. This was a novel about the characters. Purity is best read as a character study, with a rather brilliant and engaging and compelling and unpredictable plot.

Pip and Andreas, like his other novels' main characters, are vivid, unique, layered, fascinating people and each section in the novel is an intricate study of multiple characters. I loved every minute of reading this book, and didn't feel anything dishonest in the characters' arcs, only some mild-to-moderate and not unwelcome surprises. Andreas's outcome, for example, was neither necessary nor unnecessary. That bit about how unrealistic the post-murder scene was? Of course that scene, and Andreass thought patterns were weird and overblown. Probably 0-2 humans extremely similar to Andreas have been in that type of situation with that type of personality and psychology in the span of human history. Thank you, Franzen, for writing something new and, well, kinda daring. Why should I, and some unknown blogger with an MA get upset when we cant completely empathise with his reaction, with his impulse? If you're even sort of an existentialist, how can you criticise that part of the story? Or any dramatic turn a fictional character makes? Uberdramatic elements aside, Franzen's characters behave often like real human beings: unpredictably, and with a clearly free will. To criticise this novel that (e.g., for something like Andreas's story arc) is, uh, fine, I guess(?) but then the writer is kinda missing the point. Franzen takes *real* risks with his characters: with their backstories, with their psychologies, with their decisions. Thats one of the things I love most about his work.
 
It's also weird to me how this blogger uses the "misanthropic" undercurrent as a major criticism of his work (which is a gross simplification), and then faults him for "sentimental"ity like the ending. In any case, the novel's end is not sentimental. Its honest and vaguely positive and gives a sense of closure. Thats something Franzen usually does in his writing. It feels good. He does it well.  I suspect anyone who doesnt appreciate those last 30 pages is someone who is unfortunately cynical and having a sad life.

TL;DR: I fucking love Franzen and every sentence hes written after, I guess, 1992. *Freedom* is the best but still, 3 *Purity* 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! And to add on to your comment about the characters..another thing that is a huge selling point for BCS is that a lot of the characterisation is already fairly set for our protagonist, so there isn't any awkward fumbling as the writers and actor flesh out who the character is. Coming into it, we KNOW who Saul/Jimmy is, on a basic level, and some of the nuances of his character. What we get to see is the journey TOWARD the fulfilment of that character, knowing quite well who he is at the end of that journey. Same goes for Mike. 

Watching the transformation of Walt into Heisenberg was a little unsteady at first, and Jesse's evolution too. For me, it really seemed to be in S3 when their characterisation seemed to hit its own stride, and felt fully honest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree. BB BECAME amazing, but honestly, I don't think it really started out all that brilliantly. It was GOOD, but it certainly took a couple of seasons to find its narrative footing and a consistent tone and pacing. BCS started out stronger in I would say most ways, and this season is SO good. For a story like this to be so strong after only 10 episodes, that's rare. Can't wait to see where it goes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do practise headstand, yes. And as a yoga teacher, this is really unsettling. Headstand is an extremely dangerous position to just "pull up into" without any instruction. That teacher is asking for injured students. So reckless.

In my beginners' classes, I teach dolphin as a lead up to headstand and when my students are ready instruct them individually following the steps to come into the posture. It's not really "inappropriate" to teach it to beginners, provided you DO actually TEACH it! And there are several steps to be mastered before a student is really ready for it anyway. In my intermediate classes, I offer it as a suggestion IF students have an established headstand practise and still offer personal instruction and spotting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's difficult to give advice on this (though it seems like such a simple question), because everyone has different reasons that may inhibit their focus. Generally, the best thing you can do is make meditation a priority and stick to a routine. Every day, ideally the same time, same place, even if it's only for 10 minutes. Once you establish this it will be much easier to slip into that zone, because you've trained yourself subconsciously for that to be your meditation time.

Practising mindfulness in your everyday life is a big help too. Stay present. If you find your mind racing, whether you're making breakfast or jogging or working, bring your attention back to the current moment, and/or your breath. When you're doing the dishes, for example, put all of your attention on what you're doing: the feeling of the water, the sounds you hear, what exactly you're seeing, etc. So often people let their minds run rampant 99.9% of their waking life, even when aware of it, and then wonder why their 20-minute sits every other day seem to be lacking, or don't have much of an effect on their everyday life.

Another thing that is important (which is a little tangential to your question) is not to have expectations about your practise, or become irritated or disappointed if you're unfocussed. This will only hurt your practise.

Hope this helps :)

	<TEXT> All of my friends and family noticed the change in me after my first 10-day. The course truly changed my outlook, life and its entire direction.

Everyone has different post-course results and habits. A lot of people I know continued practising for a bit or a long time, but dropped off or stopped over time. Other people keep it up, and other people are so changed by the experience that it becomes a massive cornerstone of their spiritual practise and it changes their lives.

I'd guess you'll almost definitely find your monkey mind quiet down, either a little or a lot depending on different factors. Try not to go into it with expectations, though. It's basically never how you think it'll be. Good luck :) </TEXT>

I'm wondering if anyone knows how closely conversations are monitored on wechat. I was chatting on the weech with a Chinese friend (in English) about the Taiwan elections, which he'd posted on in his moments, and this led to a general short discussion on democracy. We shut it down quickly, but if we engaged in a good old-fashioned, pro-democracy, pro-freedom-of-the-press, pro-etc. wechat-ersation, are we automatically being monitored? Under what circumstances could anything, well, come of it,short of organising a protest or something? Anyone have any insight into this kind of thing?

	<TEXT> This is a very common new age approach - that the energy you "put out" into the universe attracts like energies and that we are continually manifesting our own reality based on our perceptions and what we subconsciously draw into our lives. 

A lot of this has roots in the ideas of karma in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, in that even positive or negative thoughts and intentions are part of the cause/effect cycle of karma, though it becomes a little less classical when you get into new agey stuff like the "law of attraction." The idea of the law of attraction is a bit more along the lines that your thoughts will literally create your reality in real time, whereas according to many Hindu/Buddhist perspectives, karma can take days, months, years, or even lifetimes to "catch up" to us and not in as linear a way as what you seem to be describing. 

Another somewhat popular idea in the new age trends of thought is that there really isn't a psychological/metaphysical dichotomy as you suggest, but that everything is part of one reality where those divisions don't really exist, i.e., that the psychological IS the metaphysical, and vice versa. </TEXT>

It wasn't anything traumatising or even probably remarkable, just an atmospheric sense my 13-year-old brain registered. But I may give it a try.

Your list has a lot of interesting stuff on it. The most captivating book I read that was published last year was Purity by Jonathan Franzen, no doubt. You may like him based on some of your choices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The [Sivananda](https://www.sivananda.org) Organization has several Ashrams in North America and India where many volunteers go to learn about yoga and perform selfless service be it for a couple of weeks, months, or even years. Usually people apply for a short term stay where you will practise yoga daily, have daily meditation/Satsang, and do service at the Ashram in a very sattvic, traditional environment with experienced teachers and swamis, and then staying on longer is virtually always possible if your intentions are pure.  I'd recommend looking at the website and some of the philosophy behind the organization. It's very "traditional" hatha yoga, with a semi-monastic schedule, where you will also get a lot of exposure to Hindu scripture and teachings. I lived and served at one of the Ashrams for almost a year, got my teacher training in the process, and it was the most transformative and enriching year of my life. If it's something that appeals to you, I'd be happy to answer any questions via PM :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about diving into Season 3 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-21 07:16:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all! Word on the street is that The Americans is somewhere between very good and awesome, especially Season 3. I'd like to check it out but, you know, time is of the essence! Is it highly unadvisable to just dive in to Season 3 or would a relatively intelligent person do just fine? My friends are divided so I thought I'd ask the experts (read: you lot).

Thanks for the input!

Edit: I guess there's a clear consensus! I'll start from S1. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a beautifully articulate and insightful outline of the changes that should be made here. I doubt any real button-pushing will happen here - from the responses, it looks like the hate is just going to be corral'd somewhat which, though technically a step in a positive direction, is something small. Thanks for such a great comment though, even if your message is not really heard from the powers that be. You sound like a person who is doing (or on their way to doing) good things in the world. It's refreshing to see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As almost everyone on this sub agrees: No. She becomes a worse actor as the series goes on. And not just her - the show is full of all around terrible acting, mind-numbingly poor writing, one-dimensional characterisation, and obvious plotlines with fake twists everyone sees miles away. Maybe check out Allegiance? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As kind of a sidenote, when I rewatched the earlier episodes of this season it was painful watching that first interview at Ann Taylor Loft and how flippantly she dismissed the job offer when it was SO OBVIOUS how that would have been an excellent first step for her for her to grow, get her foot in the fashion door, and get some valuable, much needed experience.  Plus her boss would have basically been an older, more mature version of herself with whom she clearly completely clicked. Oh well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good teachers work hard, whether they're in an underprivileged urban school, a wealthy wonderbread suburb, a rural village or a small city. Any teaching position you are given will enable you to grow as a person and a teacher, and to have a tremendous impact on the lives of your students. 

There's no way anyone here can know the "right" answer for you. All I can advise is this: Don't make a decision based on pride, nor on what's "easiest." Follow your heart, and leave no room for regret. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd recommend maybe altering your sequence a bit so that you practise your seated forward bends, then rest in savasana for several deep breaths, then moving onto your back bends, resting for at least a few breaths between each one either on your abdomen, or whatever position is most organic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would encourage you to look into a Vipassana meditation course. It was an indescribable benefit to me. There are courses held worldwide, but [here](http://www.pakasa.dhamma.org/) is probably the closest course location to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Short answer: YES! You will find that a regular practise will help balance your energy.

Also, in yogic philosophy, you would be considered to have too much rajas, which is a state of overstimulation and overactivity. Though practising the physical exercises, or asanas, will definitely help with that, you might also want to consider adopting some elements of a yogic lifestyle, which would also help (meditation, changes in diet, pranayama). Good luck in your practise :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always recommend checking out [Sivananda] ( https://www.sivananda.org/) yoga to students who are looking to deepen their practise. It's a more classical style that I don't think is on the FAQ, but is very traditional Hatha Yoga, which can help you incorporate many non-physical and lifestyle/spiritual elements into your practise. I'll inbox you something more specific! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never dealt with anything like this, but I would say that's a question only you can answer. If it's been 2 years and you feel ready, then that seems entirely appropriate. If you feel (for your own reasons, not your family's or your husband's family's) that you're rushing, or that something nagging inside you is telling you it's too soon, then you should listen to that. There's no real rush after all, but you should move on whenever you feel ready. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a lot of unanswered questions here that would make my decision a lot easier. Considerations such as thickness of newspaper (are we talking week-end editions of the New York Times?); strength of homeless man; how much of this income would be taxable; duration of homelessness of homeless man; how many layers of clothing I could wear; whether he would go kinda easy on me given that I'm a 125 lb woman; etc. 

Barring the unansweredness of these questions however, I'm gonna go with 4 times per week for a maximum of 41 weeks per year. But I'm layering up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol @ the episode description.

Seriously though... this was generally ridiculous. If they wanted to make this episode about Carrie and Quinn realising they're in love and genuinely want to be together and leave the agency, then they should have done that properly and focussed on that. If they wanted to make an episode on Carrie's family epiphanies/dramz, they should have done this ANY OTHER TIME IN THE SERIES. If they wanted it to be about how Carrie is now truly alone ideologically and personally, then they should have just... done that. But this was messy and boring and felt really lazy. </TEXT>
