	<TEXT> Monetization in and of itself isn't bad. It's bad when the news division has to do the marketing division's bidding because of that 24-hour news cycle.  
  
There isn't enough interesting news to fill the cycle to attract viewers which attract advertisers. So if the channel wants to survive while airing 24 hours a day, it has no choice but to throw the serious news side under the bus and replace it with something else like infotainment.  
  
It's possible to make money off of serious journalism without destroying it. Before the Internet, newspapers had been doing it for eons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  **Max Schrems: "People do not have time to protect their privacy on the Internet"**  
   
 By Lucie Ronfaut  
   
 **INTERVIEW - The Austrian student attacked Facebook and obtained the cancellation of the agreement governing the exchange of data with the United States. It calls for greater data protection for European citizens.**
 
 Max Schrems is not a student like the others. This Austrian doctoral student lodged a complaint in 2011 against Facebook for improper data retention on his users. This procedure led to the invalidation of Safe Harbor , the agreement that governed the exchange of data between Europe and the United States, and a global debate on the monitoring of online activities by the US government. His replacement, the Privacy Shield, is already being attacked by several privacy organizations. Its application is also threatened by Donald Trump, new president of the United States, who calls for increased surveillance of non-US citizens online . For his part, Max Schrems is fighting a new battle against Facebook to get recognition of a form of collective complaint at European level. His application must soon be examined by the European Court of Justice. Le Figaro met him to discuss this busy news.
 
 **LE FIGARO .- You consider that the Privacy Shield makes almost no improvement at Safe Harbor. Why?**
 
 **MAX SCHREMS.** - For me the Privacy Shield is more or less like the Safe Harbor, with a few more additions. The Safe Harbor was invalidated by the European Court of Justice because there was insufficient control over the guarantees offered by the United States to protect our data. The Privacy Shield merely asserts that these protections are equivalent to those in force in Europe. It is as if a teacher gave a bad note to one of his students and he was content to add three lines to his duty! It is for this reason that I think the Privacy Shield is likely to be attacked in court, or by the data protection authorities.
 **
 You think your fight was useless?**
 
 Not at all. I was disappointed that the European Commission does not use the judgment any further. They abandoned the idea of bending the United States when they should have gone much further. The US government has put pressure on Europe. Obtaining interesting contracts for car manufacturers is more important than the Privacy Shield. We could have waited a little longer, let the data protection authorities do their job. It's not like the Internet could explode in two days! But I am very happy with the judgment itself. It lays the foundation for limiting the oversight of any state. This decision does not apply only to the United States.
 
 **Are you planning to attack the Privacy Shield?**
 
 I hope someone else will take care of it. I am not preparing anything special. Two procedures are underway against the Privacy Shield, filed by the Quadrature du Net and Digital Rights (French and Irish associations for the defense of online rights, Ed.). I understand that the media needed a nice story to translate issues into concrete ways. I was the perfect example and this mediated a complex subject. But it also diverted the message a little. My initiative has been transformed into a struggle against America and its businesses, while I do not care. Now it's done and I want to move on.
 
 **Do you think the general public really cares about their privacy online?**
 
 This is a classic argument in the data protection debate: people choose not to worry about it. I hear that, but I also think that it is not a specific situation for privacy and digital. People do not have the time to understand the ins and outs of the nuclear energy debate, for example. They just use electricity. In the same way, they will not seek to understand how an application works and what it collects on them. Even some privacy experts are not capable so it's complicated! I am not saying that education is not an important thing, but that is not how we will win this debate. It's very American to say, "Just educate people and let them have the freedom to choose." They put a "danger attention" label on a hazardous product, and then it's up to us to decide if We want to use it or not. This approach is hypocritical. If something is really problematic, just change it. A person works on average ten hours a day, and just wants to be able to go on the Internet on his way home. She does not have time to understand and protect her privacy. We must remove the responsibility for this choice from the users, who can not assume it, and give it back to the companies.
 
 **Who should protect us?**
 
 Europe. In an ideal world, we would have a global agreement among all countries to determine what online privacy really is. But this will never happen. That is why the new data regulation , which will be implemented as early as 2018, is so important. Very high fines will be enforceable at European level. Individuals should also be allowed to make complaints more easily and to do so in groups. Class actions are very powerful tools. New arguments of complaint will be recognized, like that of moral damage. Finally, I would like to create a European data protection organization, bringing together developers and lawyers to defend the rights of all European consumers online. This is the last project I would like to pursue in the area of privacy.

Bundestag reports: New data retention is unlawful

Heise online 04.02.2017 6:20 pm Stefan Krempl  
  
According to an analysis of the scientific service of the Bundestag, the new law, which stipulates that providers will have to store metadata as of July, is not compatible with EU law. This has recently been confirmed by the European Court of Justice.

In an expert opinion on the left-wing fraction, the Scientific Service of the Bundestag concluded that the new law on the retention of data, which came into force at the end of 2015, could not be sustained in Europe. According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the standards do not meet the requirements of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), "the fact that the storage of stored data is only permitted if a serious offense is suspected ", quotes the "Mitteldeutsche Zeitung".

Accordingly, the reviewers also refer to the announcement by the Luxembourg judges, according to which investigators are only allowed to collect connection and location data on "geographically defined areas", for example in the clearly defined area of a crime scene. In addition, professional secrecy such as members of parliament, doctors, lawyers or journalists would have to be exempted from the measure. The legislature has hitherto only regulated the fact that metadata of these groups are initially partly collected, but ultimately can not be exploited.

Data retention opponent on the upwind  
The analysis pours water on the mills of the opponents of the data retention, which have already submitted several constitutional complaints against the new legal requirements . They can now build on the fact that the Federal Constitutional Court is already tipping the guidelines again - otherwise the course would lead to the ECJ. As early as April 2014, the Luxembourg judges had tipped the EU directive on the easy logging of user lanes . In December, they further emphasized that metadata should be kept at best if this was strictly necessary and proportionate.

Jan Korte, vice-chancellor of the left-wing group, has confirmed the opinion "our criticism from the beginning". The fact that data relating to the connection and location of the entire population is not subject to any circumstances is a disproportionate interference with civil rights, which is fundamentally incompatible with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The opposition politician appealed to the federal government to finally limit the damage and immediately withdraw the controversial law. The affected telecommunication companies would otherwise have only until the beginning of July, time to implement the shaky conditions technically and to throw an estimated 600 million euros out of the window.

According to the local law, access providers must store connection information for ten, location data for four weeks. For technical reasons, text messages are sometimes recorded for SMS. The e-mail area should remain outside. Federal Minister of Justice Heiko Maas (SPD) had repeatedly emphasized in the debate about the initiative that this "fully justice" to the highest juridical jurisprudence . ( Ghi )  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Privacy isn't an all-or-nothing game. It's a lot of little decisions every single day. If you want a smartphone, that's fine. You can shift the tradeof in your favor as much as you want to. Lock it down, (password protection, hardened OS like CopperheadOS, secure messaging apps, etc.) and try to change your behavior in regards to your phone. Ask yourself each time if you need to bring it with you; Taking your smartphone with you to the airport or protests, for example, is a bad idea.  
If you have it with you, but don't want to be on the grid at all times, you can look into things like Faraday pouches: These pouches are small portable Faraday cages which block all signals.    
  
You can get a cheap feature phone aka dumb phone as cheap as $10 for when you want to be able to send and receive calls, but don't feel the need for an internet connection. If you don't want your dumb phone connected to you, buy it with cash, take the battery out before you go home, don't switch it on at home. Never carry it with you at the same time as you're carrying your smart phone, etc.  
  
Having a smartphone is one thing. It's how you use it that can make a real difference.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It could be, but it is a problem on a much, *much* smaller scale. Indiscriminate cross-border mass surveillance versus targeted, limited investigation.  
  
While some members of the press engage in ethically questionable behavior, the majority serves - or tries to serve - an essential role in democracies; to scrutinize those in power in attempt to keep them in check.

	<TEXT> The Netherlands is part of the Nine Eyes alliance. They definitely do share intel with the U.S.  
  
The 5-Eyes  
The NSA operates in close co-operation with four other English-speaking countries - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - sharing raw intelligence, funding, technical systems and personnel. Their top level collective is known as the '5-Eyes'.  
  
Beyond that, **the NSA has other coalitions**, although intelligence-sharing is more restricted for the additional partners: **the 9-Eyes, which adds** Denmark, France, **the Netherlands** and Norway; the 14-Eyes, including Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Sweden; and 41-Eyes, adding in others in the allied coalition in Afghanistan.

Things have gotten more 'intimate' since then because of the terror attacks in France, Belgium and Germany. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The privacy invasion starts at the point of collection. They are taking something from you without your direct consent. Storing it puts you at risk for unauthorized access by those who have access to these systems, mistakes like being linked to a crime you didn't commit, hacks (with the possibility of altering your information) and leaks.  
  
Aside from all that, you may trust your current government with this information, but who knows who will control this in 5 or 10 or 50 years? Here's an actual real-world example of how it can go wrong:  
  
Of the 140,000 Jews who had lived in the Netherlands before 1940, only 30,000 (21%) survived the war. But the real picture was even worse than this suggests. **The Netherlands had the highest Jewish death toll of any western European country.** Of the approximately 107,000 Jews deported to the camps, only 5000 survived; a survival rate of less than 5%. On top of that, included in that number were about 900 Jews still in Westerbork at the war's end and not in the same extremis as those deported. **This high death toll had a number of reasons. One was the excellent state of Dutch civil records: the Dutch state, before the war, had recorded substantial information on every Dutch national. This allowed the Nazi regime to determine easily who was Jewish (whether fully or partly of Jewish ancestry) simply by accessing the data.**  
  
Btw: Your right to vote should be verified through your identity by confirming your citizenship, but your actual vote should never be linked to your identity. You need to be completely free from influence and consequence to be able to freely vote. If a record of your voting history exists, it may be used against you.   </TEXT>

He does show a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Privacy Shield is. It governs the transfer of data from the EU to the US. Protection against spying between member states could be part of other agreements, but has no place in the Privacy Shield.  
  
He also tries to make it seem like Yahoo didn't act in a grossly irresponsible manner:

Yahoo operated with good security, but not perfect security, much like every other prominent entity.  To blame Yahoo for the hackers assault on EU citizens privacy is unreasonable

Yeah, okay buddy. Yahoo acted against and moved around its own security team:
