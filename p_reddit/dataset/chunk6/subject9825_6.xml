	<TITLE> Is there a "line in the sand" for Warner Bros. and the DCEU? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's no secret that the DCEU is struggling, to say the least. *Man of Steel*, while divisive, did have its fans, myself included, and many were looking forward to the DCEU. But *BvS* was a complete commercial and critical disappointment, and *Suicide Squad*, despite being a financial success, has been called by many people as one of the worst films of the year. Now with the issues in *The Batman*, between the delays, rewrites, and Ben Affleck no longer directing, is there a point where Warner Bros. will thrown in the towel and abandon the project? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not just about the quality. It's the shoddiness of it all. The MCU was built on the first Iron Man, which is still arguably the best of the films, but even then all but The Incredible Hulk were at least *above average*. They put out a movie for each character, building up to The Avengers, and moving from there.

For the DCEU, there have been so many missteps and false starts that it's hard to not expect failure at this point. *Green Lantern* was the "planned" start all the way in 2011, and that failed. Then Man of Steel was OK, but still divisive. Then when BvS came out they tried to squeeze what the MCU did in several films into one, and it flopped. Then Suicide Squad flopped. Now there are problems with The Batman. It's fair to expect the worst at this point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Originally carved on a wall of the now collapsed Domus Gelotiana in Rome, the Alexamenos graffito depicts a Roman soldier (Alexamenos) raising his hand in a gesture of worship towards a donkey-headed figure on a cross. The Greek text reads "Alexamenos worships his God".

It is taken to be a mocking depiction of Christianity, as Romans of the time mocked Christians for worshiping a man who had been crucified, the most shameful way to die in Rome. The donkey head may also be a reference to the false belief that Jews and Christians worshiped a donkey God.

Interestingly, in a nearby chamber of the Domus Gelotiana, there is another inscription stating "Alexamenos fidelis", or "Alexamenos is faithful", presumably carved by another Christian as a response. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  gene editing, with the rise of technologies like CRISPR

Yeah I definitely see that being a huge issue. Like let's say a mom wants to give her kid blue hair and cat's eyes. Is she allowed to do that? Or what if we find a way to "turn off" homosexuality in a fetus. Should a parent get to choose their child's sexuality, too? Does that violate the rights of the child? I mean women can abort fetuses, so by that same logic it makes sense that they'd be able to customize them. 

Or what if a rich family wanted their children to be built like Greek gods? Obviously poor families would be unable to afford this, so that'll just create a further divide between the upper and lower classes.

I definitely see this being a big issue in the coming decades.

	<TEXT>  I believe Obama will end up being the Reagan of Democrats

Doubtful. Reagan redefined politics in America. He set us on a conservative path that we're still seeing today. Hell, Reagan's influence can still be seen in Obama's self described New Democrat ideology, which arose after Reagan and HW so Democrats could start winning in the new conservative political climate. Reagan won 44 and 49 states and his successor won 40. He turned millions of Democrats into Republicans and grew the GOP. Obama's successor lost to Donald Trump and weakened the party. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obama will be seen as a decent President, but not a great one. The fact that he was the first black president as well as his "coolness" will certainly help his legacy, but from a policy perspective it will be more mixed.

The ACA, his landmark legislation, has widely been regarded as a failure, or at the very least not nearly as successful as it was meant to be, and it is about to be torn to shreds.

Guantanamo Bay is still open.

We still have troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.

He allowed the rise of ISIS.

His "Russian Reset" has been a complete failure and Russia has been rapidly gaining influence throughout his presidency.

Democrats have lost over 900 seats nationwide, including their largest majorities in the House and Senate in decades.

54% of Americans say race relations have worsened under Obama.

He ran on being "the most transparent administration ever" and has gone after whistleblowers and allowed massive expansions in domestic surveillance. 

Armed "moderate" rebels in Syria, many of which ended up in the hands of jihadists.

Libya is a mess.

Ramped up drone warfare to kill American citizens without trial.

But honestly the most telling and biggest part of his legacy will be that under 8 years of his leadership the nation chose Donald Trump over his chosen successor. That will be his legacy. Thanks, Obama.

Of course he has done some good. He killed bin Laden. Opening up to Cuba was a long time coming. But other than that he won't really be remembered for much. Gay marriage, maybe, but that was SCOTUS. Like, nobody credits Nixon for Roe v Wade. The Iran deal maybe but that's yet to be seen if it works out. In short, Obama will be seen as an okay president who handed DJT the keys to the White House. </TEXT>

So because it's Trump it makes that line of thinking okay now? Not a chance.

Palpatine wanted to portray the CIS as "others", and put an emphasis on the military of the Republic (and later Empire), by referring to the war as the Clone Wars. As for the actual Galactic Civil War, you are correct that for the majority of the conflict it was mainly insurgents, but by the time of the Battle of Endor you had major systems in open rebellion. And since the Alliance won, they wanted to create the sense of Galactic unity that Palpatine wanted to suppress, leading to them calling the conflict the Galactic Civil War. </TEXT>
