	<TEXT> Sorry to hijack but I'm curious about using a BB for loose powder. You just use the same damp one that you just used for foundation? Do you find it keeps you matte for longer?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it was very good! I opted not to eat much of the whipped cream and sauces because it was already sweet enough. We kept joking that we were going to invite another table to help us eat it because it was that ginormous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 112 in Matte and Poreless is a neutral undertone. I haven't tried it but in swatches I've seen, it looks darker than 115 so it may be a bit dark on you. Worth at least a look though!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Shiny areas where I pluck above eyebrows </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't really know if this is the right sub to post this but here goes. I pluck a bit above my eyebrows to get the shape I want. But the skin where I pluck up there ends up really shiny. The skin under my brows never gets shiny. Why is this? I end up having to powder those spots to reduce the shine. </TEXT>
