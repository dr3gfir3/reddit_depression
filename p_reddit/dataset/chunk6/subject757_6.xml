	<TEXT> No, those are questions that would force him to respond with the details in which he has drawn his conclusion or force him to contradict his earlier statement.

If you claimed that someone died in a car crash, but then say that you've never saw the car, not sure who was driving, didn't know what road they were driving on and can't actually provide any description about the accident itself then we might wonder why you were making a statement like that. </TEXT>

 - Define "there" please?
 - What exploit did they use to 'break in'?
 - How and where were the emails exfiltrated?
 - Was anything else exfiltrated?
 - Where is the investigation report with the forensic details showing IOCs and TTPs which would be used for attribution?

He might say 'the server' on the first one but he has no chance on the others since the info doesn't exist, at least not publicly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is one aspect about Trump that everyone will eventually learn in that he's not going to talk about what he's going to do in detail nor what he's doing currently. He's going to tell he he's going to do it and then he's going to announce it when it's done. 

He always told Obama he was an idiot for announcing his offensive plans and he has thus far stuck to trying to accomplish things in the background and announcing progress. He's trying to turn an aircraft carrier right now though so he's a little busy.

It's like that dad that can never quite bear to tell his kids where he's taking them, it's always has to be a fucking 'surprise', even if it's the Sizzler.

I also think the Flynn-Turkey thing makes Flynn a pigfucker and Trump should bury his ass post haste. </TEXT>

This is the part where you're really not paying attention very well.

I agree and perhaps I could have phrased it better. What is the first milestone that will indicate to you that you're really on the right path? Is there any particular thing that might turn you off the Trump=Russia path? 

I certainly welcome any new evidence/leaks on Trump+Russia. The well has been dry, and for a lot of us, it looks pretty desperate. I'm looking at it through the same lens as any injustice that involves humans fucking over other humans. 

This means that sources can't name 'unnamed' and all compiled with authors that display various levels of mental illness due to perceived injustices but not a whole lot of facts. 

There is a whole lot of evidence for internal destabilization though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does it? What do you think the EPA has been focused on the past 8 years? Do you think they might have been overly focused on giving Federal money to political groups? When was the last time you heard about a SuperFund site being cleaned up? Checked in on Flint lately? Maybe the EPA could use a little refocusing on some of the tactical issues we have in this country?

The bill to defund the EPA gets put forward every year and it won't pass, but the guy in charge of it is going to be doing some refocusing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There really is no good reason to justify eliminating nutrition requirements for kids lunches

Do you think this is something that needs to be regulated by the Federal government or do you think that people generally try to feed kids reasonable food without regulation? If you have a regulation, you need to have ways to verify and enforce it and that costs real money at a national level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps it's part of the propaganda, but it may be a factor that some perceive communism as more economic than social. 

Words mean different things at different times to different people. People choose certain words to try to convey an idea that the words are associated with. I don't think communists have a monopoly on oppressing dissent so if I can evoke imagery of an intolerant group oppressing ideas they don't agree with by using the word 'fascism', then I accomplished my goal. 

If my goal were to try to normalize the word 'fascism' to something other than a pejorative then I'm afraid my goal would never be accomplished. 

Regardless, you present an interesting point of view that I had not considered before which is why I hang out here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The reality is that the Communist movement was the movment that had to suppress all opposition ideas, required violence, was openly totalitarian, and wanted a state that controlled every aspect of life.

Are you stating that these characteristics are not also true of fascism? 

Is the propaganda that fascism has similar characteristics to communism but most people use 'fascism' as a catch-all leaving communism unscathed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Why not just call this what it is? Communist.

I don't care what you call it. 

  people like you

Busted! I was laying a careful maze of linguistic deception but you found me out! You are double-plus good!

Now that the truth is on the table, I can elaborate to say that I find the suppression of ideas by an opposition group, even if it requires violence, to smack of totalitarianism, which I believe is a core tenet of fascism. 

If we can agree that totalitarians require a continuously growing government to achieve their ultimate goal of an all powerful state that will come wipe their ass for them then you can probably see the leap to fascism is a small jump.

I consider communism to be more of an economic philosophy, but similar to fascism, at some point you need to quiet the detractors to pull it off so you get back to the same totalitarian themes.
