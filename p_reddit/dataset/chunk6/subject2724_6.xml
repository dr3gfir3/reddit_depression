	<TEXT> First of all, Evan happens to be a gender neutral name that is used by cis-women, but misgendering happens to people with all kinds of names, it can happen because of how someone interprets your voice or your appearance as well, or for people with neutral names communicating only by text, implicit bias often leads reporters to assume they are male. But again, the great thing is that this is a super easy fix: if reporters simply confirm a source's gender pronouns the same way they'd confirm the spelling of their name or their job title, the problem is solved. Wha's so threatening about that idea? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The DOJ is probably lying about its latest claim in the Apple vs FBI case (proof) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-23 19:39:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Several outlets are [reporting](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-encryption-cellebrite-idUSKCN0WP17J) that the 3rd party who supposedly just approached the FBI offering to help hack the iPhone at the center of the Apple vs FBI case is Israeli security firm Cellebrite. 

The DOJ publicly claimed at least [19 times](https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/03/22/dojs-pre-ass-handing-capitulation/) that there was no other viable method to open Sayed Farooks iPhone other than with Apples help. This was a core tenet of their case using the All Writs Act.

But surveillance blogger Marcy Wheeler points out that the DOJ was [already in talks](https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/03/23/on-february-16-doj-got-a-warrant-to-open-an-iphone-6-using-cellebrite/) with Cellebrite about hacking an iPhone 6 in a drug case as long ago as February 16th. Cellebrite is a well-known firm used by many law enforcement agencies, and it publicly [boasts](http://www.timesofisrael.com/how-israels-cellebrite-could-unlock-the-san-bernadino-iphone/) on its website about its ability to hack Apple products. 

The DOJ never mentioned Cellebrite as an alternative possibility in its filings with the court. In this case, that omission essentially amounts to lying. They consistently claimed that there was simply no other way to break into the phone without Apples help, even though they knew there was another very plausible possibility. 

Even before this latest announcement, multiple expert security researchers have cast serious doubt on the DOJs claim that only Apple could help unlock the phone. See [this](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/one-fbis-major-claims-iphone-case-fraudulent), [this](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/how-the-fbi-could-use-acid-and-lasers-to-access-data-stored-on-seized-iphone/), and [this](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/08/snowden-fbi-claim-that-only-apple-can-unlock-phone-is-bullshit/). 

This seems really worth digging into. It really looks like the FBI is backing down from this fight because they realized they were losing public trust and werent going get the precedent they were after. Its important that the public understand what really happened here.

The FBI should come clean immediately, and admit that they mislead the court and the public, to avoid further damaging whats left of their credibility. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclosure: I wrote this :-)

It's definitely an issue of privacy, and of security in general. But the point of this piece is that privacy issues affect different people differently. The potential ramifications for some people of having their privacy violated are much greater than others. So, while this is a case that impacts all of us, it's one that people who care about marginalized communities should be particularly focused on, since it will disproportionately affect those communities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that the technology is being consistently misrepresented. They're not asking Apple to "unlock" a phone. They're asking them to write software that would weaken the security of millions of phones, and in the process set a precedent that the government can force private companies to weaken the security of their products. Engineers who use iPhones protect the security of our hospitals, water treatment facilities, airports, power plants, etc.

So, unfortunately, Apple can't just "open that one phone." If they help the FBI in the way they've requested, they'll instead be opening a Pandora's box that makes all of us less safe. </TEXT>

No. But they care about public opinion, and mainstream media attention, which these protests have already done an amazing job at sparking.
