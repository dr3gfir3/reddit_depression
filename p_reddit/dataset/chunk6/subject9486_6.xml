	<TEXT> That was not, in fact my intention, but of course if that is the impression you got that is due to an error in clarity on my part. The comment was intended as a comment on the wave of racism that has followed Brexit. Where humans see racial categories and have tended to allow (or encourage) these to become divisive, dogs seem to often just see dogs. Not Staffies and Golden Retrievers but just another dog to be treated as any other dogs. And for lots of dogs this means, to be played with. It's obviously a naively simple take on racism but naive simplicity is what's called for sometimes perhaps? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could be. Will see if it wiggles. I have hinge clamps screwed into my desk. Initially thought it was the paper moving whilst printing so I held it down with masking tape and that helped for a bit but the problem came back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So [this](http://imgur.com/LzmThhi) keeps happening after about the 6th print. Can anyone tell me what I might be doing wrong. It basically looks like there's too much ink going through the screen.


I am using a 120T screen with waterbased ink and using a 2 pence piece for off contact. I feel like the problem might be my flood stroke, perhaps I'm pushing too hard? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would like to sell my drawings as greetings cards. I've redrawn my designs to make them work as cards, here's an [example](http://i.imgur.com/GyCb93T.jpg) (it'll fold down the middle). They're all 1 colour A4 prints. I want to print some samples to take into shops and see if they want to stock them. The problem is I don't have much money and the quotes I have got so far for screen printing involve a big initial outlay before the costs start to fall. I was wondering if anyone could give me a deal on a small print run because they believe I will succeed and return with more business.  </TEXT>
