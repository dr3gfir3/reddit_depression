	<TEXT> It is a prescription based amphetamine, it was given like methadone to heroin  addicts. The drug dependency unit would give a prescription that would then be given to the chemist. Only certain chemists would dispense it. So I had to walk a good few miles to one that would. They would only give you one days supply at a time.

I remember this cunt pharmacist taking me to one side and telling me they would only serve me my prescription if i promised not to steal from the shop. It was humiliating. And the dexamphetamine was like taking weak speed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ex amphetamine addict.

I was on meth for 2 years then hooked on dexamphetamine to come off the meth.

Seriously. Now listen. 

I am 36. That was when I was 18-24. I am now an upstanding member of society. My teeth are fucked. I have almost all my top back ones missing and three crowns in the front.

I am a paranoid anxious person that has generalised anxiety and bipolar disorder. I've attempted suicide several times and my arms are covered in scars from self harm.

I started out having a great time on meth! Just like you bombing it and buzzing off the rushing thoughts and amazing energy. To this day i obsessively clean like i learned to on meth.

You know what? I thought "just once and ill never get hooked"

Then it was just once a week.

Then it was a night during the week

Then every other day

Then daily.

Then multiple times a day

Bigger and bigger doses.

Until I entered psychosis. I had the worst night of my entire life. To this day it fucks me up to think of what I hallucinated. I might write it up in a thread sometime. 

Long story short. Don't do meth dude. Its just not worth it. I took most drugs and never regretted fuck all. But I regret taking meth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This poem, particularly the last line has always struck me hard in the feels. Its my favourite of all time. 

I Go Back to May 1937
By Sharon Olds
I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges, 
I see my father strolling out 
under the ochre sandstone arch, the   
red tiles glinting like bent 
plates of blood behind his head, I 
see my mother with a few light books at her hip 
standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks, 
the wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its 
sword-tips aglow in the May air, 
they are about to graduate, they are about to get married,   
they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are   
innocent, they would never hurt anybody.   
I want to go up to them and say Stop,   
dont do itshes the wrong woman,   
hes the wrong man, you are going to do things 
you cannot imagine you would ever do,   
you are going to do bad things to children, 
you are going to suffer in ways you have not heard of, 
you are going to want to die. I want to go 
up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, 
her hungry pretty face turning to me,   
her pitiful beautiful untouched body, 
his arrogant handsome face turning to me,   
his pitiful beautiful untouched body,   
but I dont do it. I want to live. I   
take them up like the male and female   
paper dolls and bang them together   
at the hips, like chips of flint, as if to   
strike sparks from them, I say 
Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have read Stephen King for 20+ years, and he is one of my most loved authors....however it is so true his books end poorly a lot of the time.

Dr Sleep = Good ending though.

	<TEXT> So I just watched this.

Firstly. You rape a kid then death really needs to vs a punishment. I has a physically abusive upbringing. I would never smack my own children. Its no justification  to blame your past. Each and every person makes a conscious decision on how they will behave. Fact.

Secondly I do believe they should be rehabilitated where possible. Then given jobs somewhere like an oil rig where they are miles from any children.

	<TEXT> I have more bikes than cars. I have the Duke of death and karuma and a jester to take part in races or to do missions where you need an armoured vehicle. Otherwise I just use bikes. And you know what my favourite is? I have the expensive ones. The drag, a few that came with the MC update. But my all time favourite is the simple Manchez. Dirt cheap and great fun to ride over most terrain. All the CEO missions that involve a race, i win on this little bike! I also like that on bikes you have more weapons options.  Using the compact grenade launcher and compact rifle is a bonus.. </TEXT>
