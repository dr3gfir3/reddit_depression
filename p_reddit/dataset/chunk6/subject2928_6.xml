	<TEXT> interesting reaction to the chemical attack, been mulling over if Obama would do the same as this isn't troops on the ground or a civilian target. Democrats used to air strike Taliban targets in the 90s and there have been drone attacks. Though Obama had more diplomacy and this war is tricky for it. 

If Trump is serious about taken action against Assad wonder if they will pursue War crime charges to the dictator (or if they can if the base that fired it is destroyed unless they have better evidence). however, this action will piss off his friend Putin further. Though what does Putin expect by supporting nationalistic strongmen like this.

Turkey are okay with it but there are fears they want to take Syria for themselves if assad goes   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How can someone with no money improve the lives for other immigrants? If no skill means no finance in some cases

If you're referring to refugee crisis most of those who flee war zones are the middle classs who can afford the journey. It's the poor and uneducated who are left behind. Plus legally refugees are banned from getting jobs even if they want some.

UK and other countries you cannot claim benefits for 6 months after immigranting. So you need a job to survive and immigration is mostly skilled labour filling in the gaps in our health and factory industry. More so now that the baby boomers are retiring and we haven't the number to cover tax costs of thier pensions/care and fill up work. Also at a time where national youth have degrees as aspire to higher wage work. 

As Islamic immigration goes it isn't new. We've had mosques in our country since 1800s. US since the 1930s

	<TEXT> On Monday, ProPublica, the investigative news site, reported that someone had changed the terms of the trust that Trump established before he entered the White House. The trust controls the four hundred or so businesses that Trump owns, and a new clause says that its trusteesTrumps two sons, Eric and Don, Jr., and a family lawyer, Allen Weisselbergshall distribute net income or principal to Donald J. Trump at his request, as the Trustees deem necessary for his maintenance, support or uninsured medical expenses, or as the Trustees otherwise deem appropriate.

That language reads like a license for the President to extract as much money as he wants from his businesses, with no public disclosure, while hes still in the White House. For example, it appears to suggest that the trustees could sell a Trump-owned asset anywhere in the world and forward the proceeds to Trumps bank account without informing anybody. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> UK the Free Masons are pretty common. It's likely just a rich man tree house club and all the ceremony and secret handshakes are just 'because it's cool.' It likely has same influence as anything rich people do together. They even have a store in london to buy uniforms and freemason socks from known as Central Regalia and some of their lodges have tours. So its not really that secret. 

Though its conspiracy links it to the occult where the church has rivalries with them and the whole they are part of the NWO crazy theories. They have lot of symbolic stuff which people love to investigate for secret meanings or hidden treasure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Women war correspondents are an amazing tough bunch. There are still a lot working today. 

[There was an interview](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/journalists-raped-for-reporting-on-conflicts-we-were-assaulted-to-shut-us-up-but-we-ll-never-stop-9519590.html) with them some years back and some reported on how they had been shot at, kidnapped and raped when reporting but kept on reporting on the wars they were covering. 

Jineth Bedoya Lima was kidnapped by paramilitaries in Colombia in 2000 and tortured and raped for reporting on their activities in the countrys civil war.

She  said: It is a responsibility on my part to tell my story. I never for a single second questioned my resolve to be a journalist. For me it was always very clear the attack was meant to be a way of warning  not only for me but for the whole press. It was a message for us to stop dealing with these subjects.

Ms Bedoya Lima was kidnapped at gunpoint inside a jail after she had secured an interview with a paramilitary leader who was locked up there. After her ordeal, she was dumped naked on a roadside.

Within two weeks she was back at work and did not mention her rape. But after nine years she decided to speak publicly about it. She said: I believe the summit is an answer that we [abused women] have been expecting for so many years.

	<TEXT> Sounds like it comes from repeated violence against women he is in relationships with. Guess what could happen is if after 14 days the women he's dating decides to continue and at least knows the risks or that police might take her seriously if the abuse starts (as abuse escalating works to prevent the victim from thinking they will be believed.) 

Godfrey, 30, from Neasden, north-west London, who is serving a three-year prison sentence for two counts of actual bodily harm, perverting the course of justice and witness intimidation, throttled one victim and banged her head on the floor, causing trauma injuries to her head. The attacks took place over several days in October last year.

He continued to intimidate her while on bail and assaulted a second woman he was in a relationship with, Wood Green crown court in north London was told.

The order was made last week after Godfrey admitted the attacks during a court hearing on 14 February. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Murder of Michaela McAreavey </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-04 13:03:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Michaela and John McAreavey were on the second leg of their honey moon after seven day in Dubai. They were staying at a luxury legends island resort in Mauritius on Saturday 8 January 2011.  

On the 10th of January the  27-year-old schoolteacher was with her husband and decided to return to the hotel room to grab a biscuit to enjoy with their tea. Her husband offered to go but she refused and said  'No, no it's okay' and that she could go there herself. 

When she didn't return John McAreavey went up to the room and found her in the bathtub. He recalled in court that her lips were already blue as he tried to revive her. He also noted there was a mark on her neck. He tried for 30mintues to revive his wife. It was later confirmed in the autopsy she was strangled to death, placed into the bath tub and then the water was turned on.  

A postmortem has shown she was strangled  she died from neck compression."- guardian article 

Police noted in the case someone had used an electronic room key to enter the room minutes before she had entered the room. They reported there were no signs of forced entry. 

Police made arrests later which included hotel staff and the husband (who was released). Days later the police had a confession from one of the hotel staff saying he and another staff member had committed the murder. The police put the case down to the hotel staff Sandip Moonea and Avinash Treebhoowoon were caught robbing the room by Mrs McAreavey and in a panic they had strangled her to death. 

Abinash [Treebhoowoon] has admitted to us that he held her legs down and he says that Sandip [Moneea] tried to stop Michaela from screaming by covering her mouth and then strangling her."

However it was in the trial where the case fell apart and the suspects were found not guilty. Below are some details on the trial and police criticisms I can find. 

* Fingerprints found in the room did not match the accused. DNA tests performed in the UK also did not match with the accused. There is a good chance lot of the fingerprints were made after the crime scene was found. This is because the police failed to preserve the scene of the crime. "Assistant Chief Commissioner Yoosoof Soopun, said that a number of people had been in the room in the moments after the honeymooner was first discovered, including other hotel guests, but that "some of them had already left the country" before officers were able to take fingerprints."

Citing samples taken from the murdered bride's feet and fingernails, the forensic expert told the court in Port Louis: "There is no specific indication that any of Raj Theekoy, Sandip Moneea, Avinash Treebhoowoon or Dassen Naraynen have contributed to the results obtained."

* The confession was brought out from torturing the suspect for three days. They trial also became a case about police brutality. 

* The police failed to interview any other guests or people near the scene of the crime. They blame the hotel for not co-operating. 

* The police were criticized for releasing graphic crime scene pictures to a local newspaper.

* The defense tried to make a case that both of the McAreavey's (where the woman in the video looked upset) were at reception near the time of her death but it was argued in court this was actually CCTV footage of a German couple staying at the hotel.

* The police ended up deleting some of the CCTV footage as they were reviewing it. Claimed by only one article I can find online.

* According the Mauritius Telecom Sandeep Moonea (one of the suspects) was on phone to their sister at the time the crime took place. This was used in their defense. 

* The police were criticized for arresting the husband and keeping him in the station for five hours handcuffed. This included him being left in a jeep as they went out for a take away. They even told him not to be so sad as he can 'get himself a new wife'. 

* "a belt which was later found in the room was not analysed by police, the suitcase of the victim was found outside the room, the bathtub was displace before being analysed, several clues and accessed to the room was not protected." Via the wiki where an investigator hints John could be a suspect claiming his story had inconstancies like lack of a phone call records or time mix ups in statements. 

* Soopun told the supreme court in Port Louis: "I just want to state that hotel management, particularly the chief security officer Mr [Mohammad] Imrit, has played a dirty game with the police. Having that information earlier to the police, there's no doubt that poor Mr John McAreavey would not have been taken to Piton police station and treated as a suspect. "It was only on our persistent requests that we obtained the reading and came to know that a magnetic card  JMK supervisor two  has been used at 14.42 hours, some two minutes before the lady, the deceased Mrs McAreavey, had accessed the room. Then it was clear that Mr John McAreavey must be disregarded as a suspect."

* There is an article about an investigation 2012 where they claim to have a suspect but, so far, no names or arrests. The family are appealing for information in the local area. 

Most of information is from Guardian articles covering the trial and the wiki. Also searching parts of the trial not listed in full details.

Edit: adding article related to the case which lists crime rate rise on the island around the time of the murder but might not be too unusual for lot of tourist locations 

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-dark-side-of-a-paradise-island-2185181.html

When I returned in 2006, it was a radically different island. I could drive those 40 miles in less than two hours and any delays were likely to be caused by traffic congestion rather than by poorly made roads (it seems every Mauritian now owns at least one car). There were shopping malls, fast food restaurants and high rise buildings everywhere (in 1994 Mauritius had a law preventing the construction of any building above three storeys). And, within our first six weeks, my girlfriend had been robbed and attacked on the way to her early morning swim in the beautiful Indian Ocean at Flic en Flac, another tourist hot spot....

But in the first 62 days of 2010, seven people were murdered on the island and one burglar was shot and killed in the act of breaking and entering. There were 10 further incidences of violent crime, including one in which some French tourists were robbed by three men armed with a revolver and machetes.

Most of the violence is by Mauritians against fellow Mauritians, but some of it is directed against tourists. Most of the violence is connected with petty crimes, but there was one rape last year.

April 2011 three hotel worker were charged with robbing a five star hotel. 
http://www.thejournal.ie/three-charged-with-robbery-at-another-5-star-hotel-in-mauritius-114322-Apr2011/

The Criminal Investigation Division (CID) of the Chemin Grenier area arrested the three at the unnamed hotel for allegedly stealing money from reception. A plastic bag stashed in a luggage room was later found to contain 40,000 Mauritian rupees (around 1,000) and 855 in euro currency.

News Now Mauritius, reporting the latest case of alleged robbery in one of the islands luxury hotels, notes that it is only a week since employees of another five-star hotel were also accused of robbery. That hotel was Legends Hotel, where Irishwoman Michaela McAreavey met her death on her honeymoon in January.

The equivalent of 500 was taken from two rooms at Legends at the most recent robbery and one man, room attendant Reaz Gurib, has been charged with theft at the District Court of Mapou. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comic book fandom online. 

Most people I know are chill. Yet online it is either a lot of 'whaa why can't they do new things.' Then when they do new things 'aaah you've changed too much!' People just don't buy or like new stories and moan when they try to evolve the characters for once. It's frustrating as someone who likes these developments and we all know it'll be reverted back at some point anyway.   

example, Dan Slott got death threats for one of his spiderman storylines before it even got printed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 8 year old Vishal Mehrotra went missing near his home in the 1980s with claims his abduction was linked to elm house a high society brothel where claims say boys were raped and one sex worker says he saw three boys killed there 

 Mr Mehrotras son Vishal was abducted as he walked home to Putney after watching the Prince of Wales and Diana Spencer ride to their wedding in a carriage on July 29 1981.

He had gone ahead of other family members for the last few hundred yards. He was last seen less than a mile from the guesthouse.

Mr Mehrotra claims he received an anonymous call from a male prostitute in the months following. A man he guessed to be in his 20s told him Vishal may have been abducted by highly placed paedophiles operating from the Elm Guest House, Mr Mehrotra said.

In February 1982, part of Vishals skeleton was found in woodland in West Sussex. There was no trace of his legs, pelvis or lower spine, nor of his outer clothes, his sleeveless vest or his Superman underpants.

At the inquest into his death, the West Sussex coroner Mark Calvert Lee recorded an open verdict but said foul play was likely.

	<TEXT> Interesting look on how black male masculinity is portrayed and trying to break stereotypes 

The revelation lead Loftin to create HOODED, a photo and video project that deconstructs stereotypes of black teenage boys. In the project's images, Four White Teens and Four Black Teens, Loftin displays against poppy backdrops two screen grabs of google images results, each displaying visually the staggering differences in search results. HOODED focuses primarily on the hoodie, an article of clothing which, when it's associated with the black male body, is tied to white racial fantasies of black males as "thugs" and "super predators," and assumptions that they are dangerous. Many believe that Martin was killed, in part, because the stereotypes associated with his fashion choices made him seem more suspicious. 

Loftin's images provide a competing example of black teenage boys wearing hoodies. In his colorful pictures, black boys wearing bright blue, yellow, pink, and orange hoodies, are seen engaged in playful scenes: hugging, smiling, making funny faces, and posing together in ways that evoke brotherhood and reveal an interiority that isn't often seen in media betrayals. "The video and photographs show black boys who are happy, emotional, and positive rather than the traditional stereotype which paints black males in hoodies as being hardened, intimidating criminals," explains the artist. "It's important that black people, and people of color in general are accurately represented." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pushing boundaries way too early. They can be little too friendly or helpful to you and talk badly about other people close to you. Making you walk on eggshells so it's hard to say no, so they'll have tantrums (which you will be made to believe are your fault) Things like trying to get you to move in with them way too early in the relationship. Trying to take financial control. Putting you in a position where you rely on them souly. Moving you away for others. Also making it seem like they need you to survive. 

Heard for single parents have to be wary for people who push boundaries with them, their kids, gifts, babysitting etc when they hardly know them very well. Since its a grooming tactic used by pedophiles to gain access from people who need help. 

With sex trafficking, many people get find their partner rushes things, gives them gifts, moves them in. Then suddenly they need help with money and this poor person (who has in reality fallen in love with a manipulative pimp) sleeps with their partners 'friends' for money to save what is a fake relationship. 

Mens advice line sums it up well what it is like with this person if the relationship is abusive: 

Domestic violence includes a range of behaviours: physical, psychological, sexual or financial abuse. It happens within intimate relationships as well as between family members. It forms a pattern of bullying and controlling behaviours. It is rarely a one-off event and it tends to get worse over time. Abusers can be very manipulative in the way they use their power and control over you and may blame you and other factors for their abusive behaviours.

If you are forced to change the way you behave because you are frightened of your partners reaction, it is likely you are  being abused. If you feel afraid, walking on eggshells, intimidated by your partner, it is likely you are being abused. If there is conflict in your relationship and your partner hurts you (physically, emotionally etc) it is likely you are being abused. </TEXT>

Some breeds of dog need very careful and controlled care too like staffies. Even Huskies shouldn't be let off the leash and seen few owners do that (risks them running off into roads or attacking farm animals)

Agree that some breeds need licences to prove you can control a difficult breed.   </TEXT>

Odds are the stalker must have approached her at some point maybe that's why she recognised something. Church or past history at a school could explain not recognising it 100%

Father is unlikely if he wanted to control her family abusers could use other routes. could be someone she knew or had vendetta with the family for crazy reasons. 

Wonder what the odds are the killer is now dead or convicted of domestic abuse if they found someone new. Maybe they've threatened someone else in similar ways.
