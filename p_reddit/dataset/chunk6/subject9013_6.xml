	<TEXT> Welcome to the world of whiskey! I joined the craze with Old Fashioneds a while back (thanks Mad Men), then worked my way down to ryes, and now I mostly drink bourbon. I'd experiment and host a tasting night with friends. As for the burn, try diluting with water instead of ice. Once you work up to being more comfortable with the burn, just order your whiskey neat with a glass of ice on the side. That way, if it's too strong, you can decide how much you want to drop in. </TEXT>
