	<TEXT> Report is BS and sensationalist media reports have danced around the study's admission that presence of THC does not necessarily equal impairment or even signify that the driver was "stoned." This is like saying criminals must be stoned when they commit crimes (and must have been influenced by the weed), because they test positive for THC.

Driving impaired is stupid and less safe than driving sober, but this study doesn't necessarily show a correlation -- and certainly doesn't show causation. </TEXT>
