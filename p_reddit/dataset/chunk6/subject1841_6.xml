	<TEXT> The originals are still great, but the remixes or original FM's are leagues ahead. That being said though i had TWO copies of this version for some reason!

I actually just beat 1.5 story last night so I'm still chugging through the collection </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it's common at all tbh. Diagnosis in children really picked up from 90's-present, but I very rarely hear about adults. My dads very likely an aspie, 67 and undiagnosed.

I understand the sense of identifying traits as early as possible, but theres some weeeiiirrd stigma attached to not getting your diagnosis early. It's hard wading through the incredible ignorance people have regarding this condition.

	<TEXT> I ask this in particular as it's the main thing that made me discontinue playing S1. I got fairly into it despite being a little repetitive, but I could never really wrap my head around the finer mechanics, i.e medal fusion, evolution, guilt. I got the basics like type balance and which medals were my strongest to attack with, but not much more than that. I have no idea about stuff like iKairi, or other medals raved about on here. I didn't get particularly far in this game levelwise, which may have something to do with it.

Now that S2's out, it looks like a good time to go back with all the free jewels and zero AP but this is holding me back a little. </TEXT>
