	<TEXT> i actually use reddit very sparingly (insinuating i don't really care at all about karma) and hadnt realized this was already posted until after i'd posted it. someone left a reply on a tweet and i checked it out and thought it was an interesting and relatively unknown thing, and it still seems like a lot of people hadn't known about it. i'm sorry it got you worked up to that extent though :-) </TEXT>
