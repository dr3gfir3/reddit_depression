	<TEXT> Here comes my biased opinion.

I am a huge Rand supporter. But I do admit that her books are very badly written in terms of literature. These black and white heroes, stupid love lines, infinite energy sources in front of the rairoads... Just what?

In fact, what she did was trying to remake a philosophical system as a literature. It's like "Critique of Pure Reason" put into a fiction book. The ideas are great (or, at least, arguable) but the execution sucks.

If you really want to read something similar, interesting and arguable, I recommend you the books of the Austrian Economics School. Despite the name they are easy to read and quite enjoyable. You can start with "The Road to Serfdom" by Friedrich Hayek. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my childhood I read a fantasy book. This is what I remember:
1) There were two kids, I think, brother and sister.
2) They came to see their aunts, 2 or 3. Quite strange old ladies. One was sitting all the time on the same chair.
3) Then (I think) brother dissapeared (not sure about it)
4) Sister had to travel to some strange world through a shadow on the wall
5) This world didnt have a sun
6) Finally they returned and knew that their aunts knew this world.
Can you pls help me find it? Tnx in advance </TEXT>
