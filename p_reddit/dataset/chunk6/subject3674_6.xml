	<TEXT> Pretty much agree with everyone else. Cats definitely operate on their own terms - forcing a cat to do anything will only make it worse. I would try to engage with toys/playtime and food! The little fatty must like food so being the one to feed can help you establish a bond and role in the cat's life. Also sitting quietly and allowing the cat to come to you, without eye contact might help. Oh, and the Jackson Galaxy slow blink. Very slowly close your eyes and reopen them without making eye contact. Look up Jackson Galaxy - I think he's a kitty god. </TEXT>
