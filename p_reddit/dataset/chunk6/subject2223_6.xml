	<TEXT> It may seem a little silly but [Anne of Green Gables](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45) or [Heidi](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781) could be a really good choice right now since you like classics and are interested in something a bit inspirational.  

Project Gutenberg has a ton of public domain classic that are downloadable for free and they [break many of them out into categories.](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Category:Bookshelf) that could help you pick something.    

I really like looking through the old books of fairy tales and mythology from there.  The [color fairy books are some of my favorite.](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Category:Bookshelf)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is an example of what a guide can look like: http://imgur.com/kYbvCvq

I have some templates and I set up a google doc and invite whoever will be working on it.  It's easy to customize with things like screenshots and examples of AMAs from your own community.   

Here is another version: http://imgur.com/6Pm51Ic

I can also show you how to make a pre formatted submission link like this (bad link gore):

Each community can be just a little different to do an AMA in so there are always small changes to be made.  Some people need slightly more help that others depending on how familiar they are with the site.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers by Mary Roach is our bookclub pick for December! AMA on 12/30 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-30 22:05:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We decided to choose Stiff as our read for this month but feel free to check out any of her books if you have already read that (I know many of you have) 

For those who are unfamiliar with Stiff I know it sounds morbid or possibly gross but I swear it's not!  Stiff is a very interesting look at what happens to bodies donated to science. 

More about Stiff from [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32145.Stiff): 

Stiff is an oddly compelling, often hilarious exploration of the strange lives of our bodies postmortem. For two thousand years, cadaverssome willingly, some unwittinglyhave been involved in science's boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. In this fascinating account, Mary Roach visits the good deeds of cadavers over the centuries and tells the engrossing story of our bodies when we are no longer with them.

If you are a long time fan and have already read all of Mary's other books check out [Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26530320-grunt) - this is her newest book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad never wants anything he doesn't "need" and generally buys whatever he thinks he needs on his own.  We have resorted to buying him food for most gift giving occasions, usually expensive meat and seasonings for it.  By the time the next holiday or whatever rolls around it's gone so we can get more. 

For someone else you can juts go with whatever you know they like.  Booze, cheese, candy, tea, coffee, etc....    </TEXT>
