	<TEXT> Oops, I thought the problem was the sauce was too sweet. If it's the pork and the sauce, why you're going to the wrong place. You can just not touch the pork and put it in a slow cooker for 8 hours and it will come out tender and flavorful all by itself to make shredded pork.  Wherever you're getting pulled pork is trying to short-cut it because they don't want to cook it that long. There's a place like that near me, and I don't frequent it. They say they don't serve pulled pork, it's sliced. F that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me tell you a story about a little ski resort in Colorado.  We have about 12 tracked vehicles that run 16 hours per night in the winter season. So, the tracks are rubber belting, grousers (cleats), backing plates, bolts and wheel guides.  I am pretty sure that we had a problem with something in the grousers and we're changing 4 broken grousers/machine/night for two seasons. Wow, what a problem, hopefully it's all fixed this season. We thought it might be operator error/abuse, but no it's bad aluminum, bad bolts, or something else IMHO. btw, rubber belting gets replaced every other year.  And that has worked for many years as regular maintenance. </TEXT>

Sometimes you just order a crankshaft and a couple cylinders, pistons, full gasket set, etc.  The cylinders are nikasil, so we can't fuck with those.  There's a rebuild program though for cranks and cylinders so you have to send back the bad ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can cut the bones off as a slab and roll the rest (tie with cooking twine) and use your original recipe.  Use the ribs elsewhere.  Otherwise switch recipe, I think it will make a big difference, especially if you're not using a great thermometer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hmm, might be able to cook more evenly than a bone in.  I guess one could always cut the bones off, and roll the rest and then cook the ribs separately also. (I like the ribs) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> looks great.  From the pictures though, I might suggest going longer on the sous vide and shorter/higher temp on the sear at the end.  The gray from the sear is getting quite a bit into the middle of the steak.  Keep notes and see what you like/what works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would recommend not.  Used to work with an A P and his was a tatoo.  He told me why, basically third hand (sorry) story about a fueler on an airplane that slid off of a wing in an emergency situation and the ring caught on a rivet and de-gloved his finger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our stables went out of business this year.  They had some inside out tractor tires for feed or something.  Anyway, they sat unused until someone went to clean shit up and brought them to our used tire pile. We were talking with the tire guy about this and someone turned one over, the smell, I horked. </TEXT>
