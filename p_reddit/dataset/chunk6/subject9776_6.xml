	<TEXT> Ye, these two guys were playing stupid, while they managed to get decent amount of kills and damage they also got themselves killed of quite early into the game. Third guy was AFK the whole time and then we had to capture the point all by ourselves against a seemingly endless wave of defender AI's... I couldn't believe when it was over. Might post a video of the last 5 minutes I got by shadowplay (unless AW has a replay function similar to WoT?)

Great job on carrying that. I only managed to do that because of the swingfire's ability to shoot from behind cover. Sure it's way more difficult with a fragile arty piece engaged in direct fire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pissed. I've been on a ship for 7 months, we had a playstation in the mess room and only two games for it - FIFA 16 and 17. I personally don't fancy football, much less football video games. But I would always come over and watch other guys play, only waiting for glitches to happen.

Not a single one. Nothing.  </TEXT>
