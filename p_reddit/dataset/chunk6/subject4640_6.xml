	<TEXT> You got upvoted for this comment, but it is clear that you never developed, produced, marketed and sold a successful app entirely by yourself. If you are an indie developer, you need to have a way to contact your customers and be able to do paid upgrades, in order to survive. The Mac App Store prevents this, which is the main criticism of the dev of sketchapp.

If you want only huge corporations create software for Mac OS X, then go on like this. You likely work for one of them already. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is not a HTML editor, it is more like a designer. Meaning, there is no HTML import feature, unfortunately. You can design your stuff and generate HTML/PHP/CSS/JS with it. But, yes an import feature for doing what you said would be a nice feature to add into a future release. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can recommend not to use a framework at all, because you say you want to learn some skills. If you write plain JavaScript yourself, and use the canvas directly, you'll learn the most generic functionality there is. It isn't even that difficult, Canvas/JavaScript is quite high level already anyway. I wrote quite a few web games myself, and did it that way. Learned a lot of stuff which helps me understand how most of the frameworks do their work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get this question quite a lot recently. Short Answer:


* It is really easy to use. The editor is simple. And no programming is needed.
* CopperCube is really good with WebGL. Where Unity and Unreal produce a huge undebugable binary chunk, CopperCube just needs a 200 KB .js file which downloads and starts pretty much instantly. And is fast. And it's open source, hand written JavaScript, which you can easily extend yourself, if you want.
* No bullshit hidden licensing, royalties or similar. Buy CopperCube once and create and sell as much games as you want.

	<TITLE> CopperCube Game Engine 5.3 released </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-26 06:23:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi r/gamedev,


[CopperCube Game Engine](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/) version 5.3 has just been released.  


*If you never heard of CopperCube: It is a tiny but powerful 3D game engine. Like if Unreal is Google, then CopperCube is DuckDuckGo. CopperCube is pretty nice for WebGL (but does also lots of other platforms), and quite easy to use.*


 New features are:
 
 
* Fog rendering
* Greatly Improved Blender file loader
* Experimental .FBX file import
* Android source code (for pro edition users)
* Performance improvements
* More fine grained sound control
* WebGL pinch detection and dynamic scene loading
* Spanish translation
* New scripting functions
* "Load new mesh from disk..." command
* And lots of other small changes


Details of the changes are [listed here](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/changelog.html). 

CopperCube Basic Edition is also currently is -50% off. [Also on steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/364970). </TEXT>

 Government where one single political entity regulates nearly every aspect of the public and private life.

Russia may be many things, but it is certainly not a dictatorship. It may look like this in certain Hollywood movies (where you apparently get your information from) but the reality is surely different. </TEXT>
