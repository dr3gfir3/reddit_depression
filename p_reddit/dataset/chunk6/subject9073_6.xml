	<TEXT> I purchased a Tin Can Cable Car toy from Terra Toys in Austin for $17.

I purchased the Hot Wheels "Gravity" Builders Set for $9.99 at Target.

Using the Red Clamp from the Hotwheels set, I drilled a hole big enough for the pin that holds the can in place from the Cable Car Toy. I was able to easily secure the Red Clamp, which will hold the GoPro in a variety of positions.

This is perfect for Side to Side tracking shots... But there is a shit-ton of possibilities.

Crappy video demonstrating the potential... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbMUzRV3ZSk feature=youtu.be </TEXT>

I think my comment and post history would prove that.

	<TEXT> Easy... I'd create and produce a Traveling Reality TV Road Show where I just walk Shia LaBeouf to different states/cities, set up a booth, and then charge people money to punch him in the face.

A one-punch KO wins the big prize--but since he's now indestructibeuof he'll never get hurt or die--Shia LeBOOM goes the dynamite!

Career Track, bitches!

Now obviously, a show as original and inspiring as THE SHIA LABEOUF TRY YOUR LUCK BOOTH will become a virally trending ratings bonanza. So in between the production cycles, when I get tired of literally pissing on poor people, and I've grown bored with the Shi-Life... I'll have my GoogleBot Driver fly me and my G6 to different damn Continent, and leave the idiot Production Staff to wrangle ShiBeouf while I'm away.

Sure, the story could end right there... But the realist in me suspects that after two decades of exploiting a helplessly compulsive immortal, I'll probably grow tired of Champagne and Caviar and rubbing my penis on jewels and yachts, and the popularity of the "Punch LaBeouf" gimmick will likely fade, taking with it all of that easy cash.

BUT--and let's be honest here... With my level of raw charisma, when it's finally time to give him the Shia LeBoot, I'll be a legitimately celebrated household name, not to mention--a popular installation on global television.

At that stage in the game my income won't be exclusively tied to Beouf. So when I finally close the book on that lucrative chapter, I'll just pay NASA (or Richard Branson's frozen, disembodied head) to strap Shia onto a LeBooster Rocket and blast him into deep space.

At the minimum I will buy myself and this entire sector of the Galaxy, a sizable chunk of Shia Free Time to reflect and meditate on how he touched our lives.

But the truth is--even if he ultimately somehow survived, and if he was somehow able navigate home--my time here will have long ended, so... Whoever/whatever is ruling the Earth then will also inherit the task of welcoming back ShLeBo.

Here's to the future! </TEXT>

Like the 2001 thing... I'm even too lazy to copy   paste my previous, more constructive, less dew-baggy, more eloquently articulated comments about 2001 being the greatest thing since yadda yadda.

Yes--2001 is a circle jerk topic on Reddit and amongst film critiques... But without specifying details, you can take my word as an Internet stranger you know fuck-all about... it actually deserves its reputation and more. Most people have a hard time finding their own interpretation and just lump themselves in with the majority.

You should watch. You might like it.

And Circle Jerks ALWAYS look better from the inside looking out--AM I RIGHT, REDDIT--OR AM I 110% RIGHT?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Party Tricks" may not be the most accurate description, but I always have my battle-proven STANDARD PARTY TRIFECTA at the ready:

1. Standout Character

2. Supreme Confidence

3. Spontaneous Comedy

Nine times out of Ten, I roll into a party fashionably late--automatically separating myself from the heard and adding a typically more noticeable entrance to my party profile.

Within 5-15 minutes of arriving--everybody who I want to meet will know who I am (or will want to meet me).

This draws others toward MY location--which quickly facilitates me powering forward with my humor and easing myself into the #1 'Funniest Guy at the Party' spot with pretty minimal effort.

PRO-TIP: If you're running low on Confidence, Character or Comedy--you can effectively employ the "FAKE IT TIL YOU MAKE IT STRATEGY" for all three items!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> THANK CHRIST I didn't have to post 2001. Thank you, footshotxlegacy. When I saw that INTERSTELLAR was the #1 comment, I actually pulled out my hanky and wept for the future.

Fair Warning to anybody claiming Interstellar as their #1 pick:

Outside of Reddit, be careful about naming Interstellar as your #1 pick in front of others... There is a correct answer--and that answer is universally and unquestionably 2001: a space odyssey.

People may start talking to you slowly and treating you like a retarded child. This is normal. Try not to take it too personally. Understand that--based on your selection--it's acceptable to assume that it's possible you may be an imbecile.

The good news is, it's a quick fix. Just reevaluate you absurd opinions and correct them, and all will be well again after the standard 10-25 years it takes to forget such an obvious oversight.

**EDIT: Downvote me all you want, bitches. Check my link/comment history and you'll see all of the fucks I don't give. FUTURE FACT: In 10 years, Interstellar will be mostly forgotten. BUT 2001 ON THE OTHER HAND... Me and my elitist coalition of Film Snob hipsters (I'd mention the group's name--but you're not cool enough to have heard of it)... We'll all still be watching further-enhanced release versions of Kubrick's immortal classic 2001 exhibited in theaters on big screens, and we will all wear replica vintage clothing which has been ironically pre-distressed, and spit hot, locally, craft-roasted coffee onto nearby homeless derelicts.

Eat that bowl of Wheaties, Champs!

EDIT 2: I'm sticking to my guns because Reddit doesn't actually respect anything else. Let's revisit Interstellar in 2 weeks after some time to reflect.

I know we have to come together on something...

What about Boobs? Boobs are great, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No real epiphany. I never really bought into it.

I was raised Christian and indoctrinated into the [Seventh Day Baptist](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Day_Baptists) denomination. NOT to be confused with [Adventists](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church)!

They are a fairly typical Christian faith, comparable to Methodists and Presbyterians--the only difference being that the are Sabbath Keepers and worship at church on Saturday--the Seventh Day.

My Mother and her family (mother, grandparents, aunts/uncles, cousins, etc) were/are all well known and active in the denomination. So attending Church and going to Sabbath School all seemed very normal and even fun when I was a young kid--but truth be told, I was an attention whore who loved being around other kids, and a lot of what I loved about going to service was social.

My Dad was born and raised in Salt Lake City, and his working class parents preferred hard drinking and chain smoking to Mormonism. So I always observed 2 role models growing up, my Mom who went to Church, and my Dad who stayed home.

I was a smart kid. And I was born with a flawless lie detector... I always know when I'm being lied to. When you're a kid, grown ups often try to lie to you as a shortcut or path of low effort... But I could always tell. I figured out that Santa Claus was made up at 4, and by 6 (as I learned about things like Dinosaurs, Outer Space) I lost interest in the clearly mythical/metaphorical stories from the Bible and became fascinated with other things, like History and Science Fiction.

I began asking lots of hard to answer questions about the Bible, God, Heaven and Christianity... And I rarely found the answers I was looking for. Pastors, Priests, Rabbis, Youth Bible Camp Counselors; I asked a lot of damn adults a lot of damn questions. I was trying to reconcile what I believed was the real truth in my 'heart' with the stories and teachings of Christianity. And they didn't jive. Too many important things didn't make sense to me.

By the time I was graduating High School, I was an open Atheist.

I'm in my late 30's now and nothing has changed.

TL;DR... I'm not religious because my heart tells me not to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   Different people create different links between the various elements comprising their lives.

And most of us develop a different way to make these connections.

As we age, and as the total amount of data stored in our minds increases, the number of associative strands linking these component elements together ALSO increase, eventually weaving together and forming the fabric of our minds.

In your particular case, what is most likely happening is simply a consequence of how you individually perceive   process the external data you ingest each day.

Our brains never really stop working... When we're awake during the day we take in new data, then at night while we sleep we subconsciously process all of it.

This cycle of ingesting and processing information essentially becomes an iterative system by which we practice and refine our unique methods of perception.

The more that we streamline our individual techniques, the more adept our minds become at filtering and picking out certain details that other people may subconsciously "blur out" (or completely ignore) in favor of their own preferences.

It's essentially the same difference in general perception that causes some people to view a water glass as being half full while others can see the same exact same glass as being half empty.

Your mind is already open to the idea of coincidence in your life. And as you innately gravitated toward that particular perceptual rubric, you have also slowly conditioned yourself to identify instances of happenstance and/or serendipity.

So it sounds like you're genetically predisposed and wired neurologically to draw near-automatic associations between similar situations/people/places (which is not at all unusual)--hence your resulting over-perception of what you have ultimately labeled as 'Coincidences' in your life.

Or something like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd have to kind of agree with some others in here... Unless you're holding out for a personal/religious reason, there is no reason to wait. Don't be afraid... Awkward first sex is a basic part of the typical human experience. Don't make a mountain out of a mole hill. But stop the insanity and quit putting it off. Go out tonight... Get drunk, hire a hooker, politely ask a female friend--whatever--just do something. Get it over with. Now. Power through Round 1 so you aren't hung up on the "virginity" thing.

Your first time will not roll out perfectly no matter how you approach it, so throw caution to the wind and just DO THE DAMN THING. Once you flip the script, Round 2, and Round 3 will be much easier. And eventually you build up enough momentum (read--experience) and then--BAM! You wake up one day and realize you have a sex life.

But you have to win a few skirmishes and battles before you can fight the war.

Sex is awesome. It's really awesome. But the longer you wait and wonder, the more mythic the event becomes... And it's just not worth waiting arbitrarily. It's just sex. Once you pull the trigger--you'll understand. It's a much bigger preoccupation when you think you might be missing out on something great. And it will continue to grow in importance until you give up completely or drop the hammer.

Just remember... Think of Sex as a lifelong, iterative process. And give yourself permission to fuck up and have fun with it. After all--it's SEX! Just don't be disappointed if losing your virginity doesn't end up feeling like the Quckening in Highlander.

Popping your cherry won't Shatter the Earth or turn you into a instant god-stallion. You won't be fundamentally changed afterwards--you'll be the same person--just a little less sexually curious/frustrated.

So try to relax and really enjoy yourself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> PART 3 - The Erosion of the Middle Class (of films).

All right; the movies themselves have shifted to a small-risk/big-gain system of generating revenue. And now the movie theater chains exhibiting these weak pictures have also themselves fully transformed into soulless, corporate mega-plexes--bent on getting our precious cash.

At this point, the strategy (if there was such a thing) shifted away from making excellent films that 'play all summer' in favor of shitting out these now-familler, cookie-cut, unimportant, insubstantial, piles of crappy eye candy... TRICKS not Treats, that have been specifically designed to swiftly recoup budget and ad revenue monies by using slick, spoiler-packed (and usually misleading) trailers to seduce starved Movie Geeks into shitty films. Like a Mad Men marketing schemee.

Timing always plays a factor... And knowing that all the poor saps will end up feeling ripped off when they realize just how fucking awful the movie was. So the new Prime Directive became simple... Shock   Awe. Get as many people to pay for the latest Sci-Fi fuck up, or Comic Book shit stain--then stock-pile as much goddamn money as possible before the negative reviews circulate, or bad word of mouth kills the momentum completely. It's like a scam we keep volunteering to fall for.

It's not that we're stupid. We're not gulible or gluttons for punishment. I swear to Black Baby Jesus I was utterly convinced that JOHN CARTER OF MARS was gonna rock ass. We don't have to do a deep dive on how astoundingly far from the mark I fell short on that score. Let's just say it--the movie fucking sucked. But the Trailer was ridiculous! It made me get excited about the movie! That's the scam. But it's not our fault because... 

THE FACT IS, we still hold onto our optimistic excitement because some of these bloated spectacles ulitimatly defy our lowered expectations and deliver something a bit more substative--like CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER.

To me though, one of the worst side effects resulting from all of these elements combining: the near extinction of the Moderately Budgeted Studio Feature. Were they animals, they would be listed as Endangered Species.

Just like disappearing economic middle class in America, contemporary Hollywood films are more often falling into one of two extremes:

Low Budget Art-House Films

OR

Mega-Budget Blockbusters

There was a fabled time that movies from smaller studios and with moderate production budgets--not too high or low but, just right--were a cinema mainstay. Movies like FIRST BLOOD or ALIENS were not filmed on high budgets. But NO MORE. Nowadays, films from the "low" end of the spectrum are typically marketed and sold as theoretically being of a higher quality--but I have to call Bullshit.  In my opinion, the collective difference in distinction is often marginal and typically superficial.

The sad news is: really outstanding films are simply fewer and farther between these days. OF COURSE--excellent films are still made and released every year, but the absurd majority of these so-called Art-House or Indy films (good or bullshit) end up being exploited as Award Season 'calling cards and used to garner artistic street credibility in the industry.

On the complete opposite side of that Teeter Totter,; rom the Studio POV, he Opening Weekend Gross is now the pinnacle concern, and Total Profit is God. What a weird place to live. It's backwards place where talentless, unfuckable Spreadsheet Nerds use sophisticated algorithms to remove  the guess work and catastrophic risk out of movie making by intentionally being bland to appeal to the buffet-food-eating masses, and ensure they make money--regardless of how many people they disappoint.

PART 4 - The Sliding Scale and The Shortened Window

The final piece of the puzzle. It's not a big secret but it's not widely publicized outside the industry... A major innovation that became very popular was the Sliding Scale Exhibition Contract.

Basically, Studios make the majority of the Box Office ticket sales Opening Weekend. Conversely, the Theater Chains keep a higher % of the ticket sales for every week the film stays playing. This is why Theaters sell 11 cents of Popcorn for $6 to make profit. But it also means that the movie Producers typically have no financial incentive to shoot a film with "legs"--that stays popular (maybe even builds momentum) and remains in theaters for a longer time.

So... The SHOCKING secret has been uncovered: The Studios AND Exhibitors both openly prioritize cash over quality. I know... It's astounding.

But most people never connect the dots and see the big picture...

A system designed to manipulate you into buying a ticket on the 1st weekend so the Studios and Financiers can bank vault your dollars before you realize you were scammed.

The bottom line, the final answer is... Movie Lovers are predictable. Until some Boston-Tea-Party-esque event inspires us to revolt, will continue to risk routine disappointment for the chance at catching that rare diamond in the rough.

Despite these facts, people keep going to the movies and spending money.

And that's why bad movies keep getting made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, lifelong movie geek and former Manager of several large, multi-screen Movie Theaters in Central FL and Los Angeles.

The obvious TL;DR is easy... Major Money. But...

A lot of people might not know how we got to this place. It slaps logic in the face, but it's an observable truism... Year after year since around the turn of the century, Hollywood studios have shamelessly taken turns shitting out astonishingly awful, high-budget "popcorn" films--the majority of which turn big profits..

It's not a conspiracy. It's a business.

The Motion Picture Industry is, was, and always has been about turning a profit.

But the shift to flash over substance was actually a natural progression.

And it can be split into 4 PARTS:


PART 1 - The Rise of the Summer Blockbuster.

In the late 70's, unprecedented, box office smashes like JAWS and STAR WARS redefined many of the ways Hollywood Studios budgeted, produced and marketed films.

Throughout the 40's, 50's and 60's, the motion picture had come to dominate pop culture entertainment. It was a time when a diverse group of filmmakers and studios were producing a great number of films annually, in many different styles and sub-genres.

This was a time where interesting characters, complex stories and quality production were not just ends to a means--but rather essential elements in any major Studio release. Low budget films of that era had such a radically different production aesthetic, they were almost always graphic (for the time) Horror movies or Counter Culture pictures.

The 70's were an innovative, experimental, and almost mythical era in Cinema. The Directors and Writers who rose to prominence in that decade are still some of the biggest names in film history. Before the emergence of the 80's greed culture with its obligatory, laser focus on maximizing profit by all means necessary. The guys with the ticker tape adding machines were utility workers, while ballsy studio executives took exciting risks... A time where a major motion picture could be green-lit and financed based solely off of the artistic merit and well-earned reputations of the writers and directors involved.

But then JAWS/WARS re-wrote the rule book. The Summer Blockbuster existed and a huge, money-making opening weekend was now a proven concept. Success breeds imitators and by the Summer after STAR WARS, every Studio on the damn planet shifted their focus to producing more Blockbusters.

This major philosophical  change became a motivating factor in another paradigm shift within the industry; the final collapse of Old Hollywood. As budgets swelled and profit margins grew wider, competition amongst the major players saw the last vestiges of Hollywood's Golden Era sold, bought, traded, aquired or hostiley taken over by a host of different corporate interests and multi-national conglomerates.

The white-hot injection of 80's corporate greed into the heart of New Hollywood helped to stimulated the establishment of new, standardized, and more-bankable methods of producing films. And once these cost-effective innovations proved successful, traditional Hollywood practices were abandoned almost overnight, and supplanted by the slick, new Profit-focussed standards. 

As a consequence of the corporate takeover in LA, there where fewer Artists and more Middle Managers calling the shots on productions. And these business-minded Desk Jockeys very much coveted The Almighty Dollar more than almost anything. The general quality of films dropped sharply, and stylization was bumped to a lower priority.

The entire industry changed almost overnight to adapt to the new standards.

At the same time, the United States of America saw their previously high-quality manufacturing standards begin to deteriorate in the face of competition from China and Europe.

The Number Crunchers seeking corporate-style success in Hollywood hedged their bets and got very comfortable with the idea of selling an inferior product to quickly recoup losses. And just like bland Buffet Food, the movie going public seemed to forget about flavor and get familiar with flashy mediocrity.

AND just like the greedy cocksuckers they are, the Studios decided to start charging the Exhibitors more money to rent their bullshit film prints.


PART 2 - Dawn of the Mega-Plex.

As the standard practices of traditional Film Exhibition evolved and became corporatized, the actual business of operating a movie theater was now a potentially less lucrative venture. Many owners closed down their theaters and numerous theater chains were bankrupted or went out of business . The gaps in exhibition created opportunities for expansion that lead to yet another significant shift in the industry.

Around the mid 80's/early 90's, several companies and investment groups started snatching-up and acquiring the movie theater chains who were in financial trouble, and the timing proved to be perfect. By the end of the 90's, a handful of corporations (including Knoxville's Regal Entertainment Group) now controlled the entire Exhibition Industry.

By this time, the young Studio Accountants helping to steer the New Hollywood Movie Machine were now absolutely COUNTING on big opening weekends to jump start their profit-earning. Whereas in the past, if a film demonstrated verifiable Longevity (how long the movie plays in theaters before being pulled), it was recognized within the industry as a clear indication of quality filmmaking and popularity.

But because Exhibitors--and more specifically the National Association of Theater Owners--held so much leverage, they were able to capitalize on the situation and began structuring Exhibitions that utilized a "Sliding Scale" which adjusts the % of the Box Office Ticket revenue progressively more in favor of the theater based on how long the movie continued to play. I other words... The longer a movie stayed in theaters, the less money was collected by the Studio. When GLADIATOR became a hit, it stayed playing in first run theaters for nearly 2 months, reducing the Studio's share of ticket sales to virtually nothing.

It soon became even more apparent to the Production Companies that there was really no great financial incentive or fiscal advantage to keeping any film on screens for longer than 3-4 weeks. Regarding quality, giving up on longevity was the final nail in the coffin. Motion pictures of a dramatic or artistic significance were now the exception to Blockbuster Hit rule. As a result of the flip, any film that didn't scream "hit money maker" stood a good chance of being relegated to the Minor Leagues of alternative financing and independent production.

So just a brief recap:

A. Hollywood Studios go Big Corporate.

B. Movie Quality suffers.

C. The Film Exhibition Industry goes Mega-Corporate.

D. Movie quality plummets.

Sigh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once upon a time in 1994...

From what I remember--it was a pretty fun year. I was 18, freshly graduated from High School, and living the dream in Miami, Florida. 

During this period I divided my free hours into a variety of fun activities involving a wide variety of wacky people... Some of them were scum bags, most of us were cool, but ALL IF US PARTIED.

Among the peripheral, edge associates of my core circle was a quiet guy named Kevin. Kevin was somewhat of a mystery to everybody. He was literally the guy who nobody could remember who's friend he was or how he knew us. No one ever invited him out or told him about parties--but he was always hanging around.

Out of 20 people there were 3 of us who owned cars--and I was one of them. With math like that, giving rides to my friends was pretty standard. So when a nervous looking Kevin magically appeared at my door one Friday night--I knew what he was after...

He needed a ride and he asked me if I would take him to his Uncle's house.

My obligatory, knee-jerk first response--was to blurt out--"SIGH--I'm not sure I can, Kevin" which was immediately met with a happy "I have gas money"--and I knew he did--because one of the only things we knew about Kev was that his Granny got him a Gas Card and paid the bill. CH-CHING!

First stop Gas Station! Next stop--INFINITY!!

As we leave Gas Station I see my gas needle spike and ask--"How much did you put in?"

"$20" he replied.

SCORE!!! So far--So fucking awesome. 18 year old me was pretty stoked. Because $20 bought a lot of damn gas in back in '94, and my tank was officially full.

So Kevin navigates and I continue driving to his Uncle's place. The temp-glow of my full tank euphoria fades, and as I glance around, I realize that I haven't really been paying attention, and don't exactly know where I am--I just know...

I don't belong here.

But--WHY? You ask...

BIG REVEAL: I'm Irish.

And I mean light Irish. Irishy Irish. Indoors in the dark avoiding sunlight Irish. Like a pale with pink blotches bordering on albino kind of Irish. With that undead, kinda semi-translucent skin which can only result from inbred genetics inherited from my Celtic ancestors, who spent 24 hours a day fleeing in terror from the Sun, and hiding in a Bog somewhere in Northern Ireland.

So... I'm white.

That fact in and of itself isn't all that noteworthy, but I knew a lot about being white. I was pretty much an expert of being a white guy. Shoot--I'd even grew up in a mostly white neighborhood. But as I looked around, I couldn't help but notice that a significant number of people were just "hanging out" and loitering in the streets.

Kevin pointed to his Uncle's house. I pulled over and parked in front of the driveway. "K--I'll be right back dude" and WOOSH--he slips outside and dashes behind the house. "Hey--wait, what now? I thought I was just dropping y--"

"DON'T LEAVE ME, DUDE!" He screamed so loud the whole neighborhood looked my way. Kevin slipped behind the house.

Shit. I glance in every direction and try to look inconspicuous--but it doesn't feel right. Something's just 'off'. 

Just then a black dude walked past me. He glances back over his shoulder and winks at me while slowly dragging his finger across his throat--OR MAYBE HE JUST SMILED POLITELY--the point is-- it was at that moment that I become fully aware of the situation...

I was The Only White Guy in an All Black Neighborhood.

And I was already drawing attention.

I wasn't scared (much). I mean--I was cool, I could hang, I was "down". And like, if any of these nice black gentlemen gave me a hassle, I could quickly explain how my circle of friend was a veritable rainbow coalition of ethnically diverse people. And as if that wasn't enough--I was a big fan of Hip Hop! That would totally win them over.

So between that and my expansive knowledge of Cosby Show trivia, I was super confident that I was safe, because I had all of the "Street Credibility" I needed.

So I did what any white kid would do... I chilled.

That's right--I stayed totally parked, with the engine off, directly in front of what was less likely an Uncle House and more likely a Crack Shack--right in the heart of The Hood. So I cranked up my Onyx tape and pretended to not know all the words while I nodded my head to the beat and waited for Kevin.

But that was only Phase 1. As my level of confidence--fueled by my ignorance--began to elevate, I realized that I may be alienating myself by acting self-involved.

So I initiated Phase 2, which is best summarized by me making eye contact grinning like an idiot at every Black person in my vicinity. And to really kick it up, I'd throw out a soulless 'Peace-Sign/Head-Nod' combo. That really got 'em talking.

Sure... I could have just left. I could have abandoned Kevin. I could have even just driven around the block a few times, and come back later--but all of those options were far to sensible. "Besides"--I thought--"what's the worst thing that can happen??"

Just then I felt something like a flashlight jab me in the guts, accompanied by a deep, Black man's voice say--"Hey, boy".

I looked left and found myself face to face (nearly nose to nose) with a nice person who I will call GOD DAMN. 

Now I never had time to get to know God Damn personally, so this is based purely on his appearance... But to my naive, 18-year-old pea-brain, God Damn was the dark, hulking, physical manifestation of every racist-inspired stereotype I had been told--by other whites and the media--that I should always be afraid of. And it was easy, because God Damn was a scary looking guy.

I felt that Flashlight push further into my stomach fat. I look down... Oh no. That's not a Mag-Lite--that's a gun!

My heart skipped but I never panicked. With hesitating, I blurted out--"Don't shoot me" in a very matter-of-fact way.

"What you got?" He reached in with his other arm and starting slapping my pockets. "Nothing" I replied.

GD: "Where the money at?"

ME: "I don't have any."

GD: "What you here for?"

ME: "I gave this guy a ride. Seriously, don't shoot me, man."

God Damn kinda smiled a little, then looked both ways, pulled the gun barrel out of my gut--"Get the fuck on"--and walked away.

I left. Quickly.

I never went back for Kevin... In fact I only saw him twice after that and didn't even make eye contact.

I still offer rides to friends and even help an occasional stranger with a lift--but I've never been caught slipping again.

Having that guy sneak in and put a gun on me taught me a valuable lesson in the importance of situational awareness.

And I never forget it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, man, that's really cool! (-- zero sarcasm) whenever somebody loves 2001 or Kubrick, it typically indicates that they're good peoples.

I love 2001. It's my #1 favorite film of all time. If you scan my comment history you'll know... I'm street legit. I'm a few years older than you, but 2001 has been my favorite film since I was a kid. Since before I could even grasp the concepts, or verbalize exactly why I loved it--I just knew. I could feel it. Like eating drugs or falling in love. 2001 fascinated me then, and still blows my mind over 30 years later.

FUN FACT: 2001 is RATED G!

I've talked a lot about 2001 over the years, and I've been asked many times--Why?

Why do I like 2001 so much?

I used to try and articulate an answer, but after many years and many talks, rather than rattle off a bullet list of impeccable scenes, break down my unique interpretation of the plot, or detail my "superior" understanding of the deep philosophical concepts... I've distilled my response to this:

2001 explains nothing.

It explores huge theoretical concepts, tackles deeply profound concepts, and stimulate an almost limitless number of questions--

But it answers none of them.

Like all great works of art, the questions are yours to answer, and any deeper meaning is ultimately yours to ascribe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a Middle School aged young man, I spent parts of my Summer Vacations in rural Minnesota with my Grandparents. Each Summer I had to confront the same Bully who habitually harassed my female cousins.

Now... At this age I wasn't exceptionally tall or strong, but I did have some extra weight on me. More importantly--I was a popular class clown character who wasn't used to being disliked and had never been bullied. So I just typically acted with confidence and didn't have a victim's state of mind. Oh--and I've never been afraid to fight if necessary.

So this dickless little shit (who probably had his own issues as Bullies typically do) was riding up and down the street on his Huffy throwing rocks at the girls. I was inside at the time trying to see Phoebe Cates' boobs on HBO--when my younger, female cousin runs in the house crying. She was also bleeding from a small cut on her forehead.

Just then--TAK!!--the bastard throws a rock at a window (which didn't break somehow). WOOSH!--I leap to my husky feet and run outside in time to see him chuck another rock at the girls. "HEY!" I shouted. He laughed and swung his BMX around and peddled straight for me--"What are you gonna do, Fat Boy?" I stood my ground until the last moment, then hopped to the Left. As he raced by I took a one-two step and--WHAM!!--straight kicked his bike right in the middle (the sweet spot) of his suicide bar! He and the bicycle just tipped the fuck over onto the hard concrete and skidded like 8 feet. He was... Totaled. Done. Laid out moaning. One of the girls (the extra compassionate one) tried to help him up but he cursed her too. U/subject9073: One - Bully: Nill.

7th Grade... Small Community Pool. As I change into my trunks I can already hear ole Loudmouth J Bullykid picking on various kids at the pool, including my younger female cousins and--not kidding--the Liitle Deaf Girl (every small town in MN has one). I quietly walk out to the water, watching him splash and kick and dunk and mock almost every other kid there, and with 'No Life Guard On Duty'--I decided it was my duty to take the Bully down again. So I just waited for my moment... Loudmouth was so wrapped up in his bully endeavors that he never Crazy-Ivaned and checked his 6. But my cousins knew the score... And as they completely clear away from the Bully, so do the others. As Bullworth Loudermouth is calling some 4th Grader a 'Faggot Pussy' for swimming away so quickly, I just launch into an Olympic sprint and leap into the pool--sort of half Cannonball-Jackknifing onto his head--BLOOSH!! Gurgle gurgle... He came up swinging and tried to dunk me but I was slippery like a Whale and buoyant like a Walrus. One rake on the titty from his dirty, gnarled Bully talons underwater was all the motivation I needed to spin and deliver a devestating Mule-Kick to his wee solar plexus. I literally watched the air leave his body. We were mostly in the shallow end so he couldn't have drowned. But after choking on some water and gasping for his breath, he pretended he wasn't crying as he left the pool embarrassed--swearing to exact revenge on us all. U/subject9073: Two - Bully: Nill.

8th Grade - The Final Ultamatum. I am exiting the Church (every small town...) and what do I see?? Little Johnny Ratface Bullymaster! And he's looking fresh off a Spring growth spurt. He's a bit stalkier than I remembered. Well, yadda yadda--I walk outside and the boney little fuck-fangs has my younger cousins 'trapped' inside the prison-like bars of the Handicap Access Rampway. Essentially, he is just fast enough to hop over the railing and race ahead of the young kids, keeping them running back and forth, up and down the ramp. Some of the boys escaped, but of course, Billy Bully Cockface prefers to menace the girls--and was doing just that as I walk outside. The girls scream. I blurt out my obligatory battle cry--"HEY!" He spins and sees me and literally rolls his eyes (one slightly lazy and jaundiced) and laughs and says, "I got you this time Fat Ass". Well--not only was that insult wildly inaccurate (it's well known that I have kind of a flat butt comparatively speaking), but this fuckin bitch didn't even attend service--he showed out specifically to play Scut Farkas on the kids. I was pissed. And I had had enough.

He was making a BIG production out of rolling up his sleeves and prepping for the fight--on the outside of the ramp, balancing on an 8 inch lip of concrete on the other side of the railings... I was right in front of him when he asked--"Are you ready?" I said, "Yep"--he grabs the rail and leaps to swing his legs over and land inside the ramp. While he is literally hanging in mid-air, I punch him in the wrist, breaking his grip and dropping him on top of the top railing mid-leap--CRUNCH! Then he just crumbled and tumbled onto the dirt with a dull THUD! I lobbed my Chubness over the rails and hopped onto the ground next to him.

He actually held his hands out and made a "T", but was to weak to actually call Time Out. Pathetic. I leaned in and shouted something clever like "You better stop picking on us!!" To which he whisper-gasped "Okay okay..." In return.

U/subject9073: Three (The Triple Crown!--The Trifecta!!)

Bully-Tits McGuilicutty: Nothing! ZERO! No Fatalities!!

3 Summers. 3 Wins. Very satisfying.

That was some bad ass shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I must be old... I'm late to the thread and kinda shocked nobody has mentioned 'So I Married An Axe Murderer'.

In the 3rd act, when Mike Meyers is trying to dial 911, the real Axe Murderer is revealed when they swing an axe into the Phone--KERCHUNK!!--and he chokes out a flawless "What the FUUCK!?" So perfectly delivered. Definitely in the PG13 Fuck Hall of Fame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOOPER. Despite all of the effort--and taking a healthy dose of dramatic license into account... The fact that this "Crime Syndicate" of the future doesn't have a more foolproof method of killing their targets is SUCH BULLSHIT. These dumb fucks know EXACTLY when and where their targets will materialize--but they haven't figured out how to dig a damn Punji Stick Pit, or lay down something with a trigger like a Claymore, or a fuckin Bear Trap... It's astounding.

And don't get me started on the Amputation/Itstant-Limb-Dematerialization scenes (which are just retarded), or the ending, which is complete bullshit--scientifically and dramatically. Ugh. What a piece of shit.

I get sick of hearing people rave about how mind-blowing it is, or point out that "the guy who made PRIMER consulted on the Time Travel". Whatever. The bottom line is... Primer is a 5-star film. Looper is a 2-star waste. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Grew up in the suburbs of Orlando, FL... I was there when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. My school class walked outside to watch the launch (something we always did), and it happened. The adults seemed to realize something bad may have happened. When we went back inside, the TV and Radio confirmed the bad news. It was pretty sad. </TEXT>
