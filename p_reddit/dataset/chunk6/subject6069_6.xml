	<TEXT> The two books I've read so far this year that made me laugh out loud were *A Confederacy of Dunces*, about an eccentric, bizarre man-child who lives with his mother in New Orleans and his quest to get a job, and *Consider the Lobster* by David Foster Wallace, a collection of essays about attending a porn convention, following John McCain's 2000 primary campaign, and the ethics of boiling lobsters, among others.

If you like journalism, Jon Ronson has some funny and entertaining books. *Lolita*, while disturbing, is also hilarious. Kurt Vonnegut has some very funny books - Cat's Cradle and Sirens of Titan are my favorites by him.

Sidenote - I, too, hated Ready Player One.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something that always stands out to me in comments made by members of the cabinet and administration is that whenever they refer to policies that will help "people" or "working people" or "Americans", they are nearly always talking about "heartland" people - i.e. white people. It's notable, especially alongside the steady implementation of policies that will ostensibly benefit white "heartland" people and which are antagonistic towards what they appear to deem "outsiders" - Mexicans, middle-easterners, attendees of HBCUs... in other words, black and brown people. </TEXT>

When you start several steps towards home base it's more surprising if you fail and squander your wealth than it is if you succeed. He's not some rags to riches character. He received a loan, inherited a business, and had pre-formed connections given to him on a platter. Not to mention his father bailed out one his casinos to prevent him from completely going under. He's media-savvy. He's a good promoter. That's his skill set. Everything else is lawyers, connections, gifts, and loans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say that's more of a rationalization based on outcome than an actual way of reading his actions, don't you think? Using that logic, anything that doesn't play out in his favor can be deemed long-term 4D chess that hasn't paid off yet, and anything that succeeds can be called successful 4D chess. Basically, using that logic, it's impossible for him to lose. With that in mind, it seems more like a justification than a realistic read of what's happening.

Considering Trump was full-throated in his support of the healthcare bill, and that he, along with his staff, spent many long days twisting arms in congress to get it to pass, do you think he would have been upset if it had passed?

If the new bill that goes to the floor (if there is one) looks a lot like the previous one, and Trump supports it, will you consider that actual support and endorsement? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> News and news commentary are two different things. Those "whitelash" type comments are news commentary and analysis. They even introduce those people as analysts - a panel of analysts, not as anchors. Their job is to discuss the issues, not just report the news, and bias/political leanings will always play into that. In fact, that is the entire purpose of those segments. To foster a debate and conversation between the panelists *about* the news, not to report it. CNN doesn't do a great job of it because they're a corporate media outlet mostly concerned with ratings, but regardless, a straight-up news cast is a different thing than a commentary panel. Conflating the two as simply being "news" makes little sense, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "To what degree" is a nonsensical question. As Nye says, it's the rate of change, the rapid change, that is concerning. We would expect to see changes in the climate - ups and downs over long stretches of time. As Nye says, it's unclear that we would have gotten to a point, at all, ever, where the temperature changed this quickly - so Carlson's question "how long would it have taken without humans" makes no sense, because we wouldn't get there at all without humans. We'd experience the normal ups and downs of the cycle, with temperatures gradually rising and falling rather than rapidly peaking. Think of it as putting a pot of water with an egg in it over low heat for 5 minutes, then putting it in the fridge for five minutes, vs throwing an egg in the fire for 2 minutes and then covering it in ice for 2 minutes. The temperature of the egg is rising and cooling, but the rate of change makes a huge difference in what happens to the egg. Talking over someone trying to explain that while wearing a stupefied expression that suggests what the other person is saying is ludicrous is not engaging in an honest debate, is it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice! Since you've read them, if you feel like checking out a podcast that was a lot of fun to listen to, there's one called Alohohomora where they do a chapter by chapter reread of the series. I really liked listening to an episode after each chapter. They made it all the way through the seven books, finishing up last year. The first 10ish episodes are a bit rough, but they get into a groove and get better as they go.

Also, the illustrated editions are totally awesome! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can agree with this on everything except the Gorsuch nomination. By all accounts he's not in any way "compromised" in the way that everyone else associated with and/or appointed by Trump may be compromised. The danger of filibustering Gorsuch's nomination is that the Republicans will go nuclear and eliminate the need for 60 votes - meaning that next time, Trump can nominate *whoever he wants*, and all it will take is a simple majority to put them on the bench. If Trump *doesn't* get impeached and has the opportunity to nominate a second judge... we might be fucked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one would pride themselves on the opposite, but it seems that Trump's only substantive claim about his political skill during that campaign was that he is good at hiring. He hasn't expressed in any tangible way that he has acumen aside from that. You'd expect that a good leader would have other qualities aside from delegation to brag about - qualities like an inspiring personality, a highly-informed point of view that can lend valuable guidance, or passion and keen insight. Trump hasn't expressed or demonstrated any of that. Instead, he just says he picks good people to make decisions for him.

To be fair, he does claim to be a great negotiator as well - but I think recent evidence suggests otherwise, at least in the political realm, and I'm not sure he's provided any evidence of his negotiating skill (in a public forum anyways) in the business world either. It might be lurking in *The Art of the Deal*, but not having read it, I couldn't say. </TEXT>

And just to rant for a minute - if God has a plan for everything, do prayers change that plan? If god's all-knowing, wouldn't he know that change would happen beforehand? Meaning he didn't really change his plan, he just followed it. Meaning your prayer was foreknown and the change was already locked in place. Meaning there's no real freewill.

	<TEXT> Last week I read two books since both were on the short side:

1. **The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time** by Mark Haddon. I really enjoyed this book, and it was quite a bit different from what I expected. In my mind I'd always pictured this being similar to that movie Brick about the high school detectives - but it turned out to be an interesting portrait of a kid with autism. I liked the way the author incorporated drawings since it fit so well with the narrator's personality. The first half of the book was stronger than the second, I felt, but it had a great conclusion.

2. **Multiple Choice** by Alejandro Zambra. This was a blend of poetry and short fiction in the format of a multiple choice test. There were a ton of interesting things about this book, and the format actually lends quite a lot to the experience. The first section is "fill in the blank" sentences, where you choose from a list of words, and often times, replacing a word or two changes the meaning of the sentence and creates a cool, contemplative experience. For example:

 I want to gather these words together, ________ nothing makes any sense.

 A) though

 B) so that

 C) even if

 D) but

 E) until 

I think my favorite from this section was:

 Last night I dreamed you were a ______ and I was a ________ and we were ________ together.

 A) dog  dog  barking

 B) leg leg dancing

 C) tooth tooth biting

 D) nun priest sleeping

 E) ghost ghost always

There are several other sections like this, such as one where there are a few options on the order of sentences, where, again, the order changes the meaning of the paragraph, and there are a few short stories at the end. I loved it overall - lots of themes explored, like loss, ennui, nostalgia, and of course, love.

---

This week I'm reading **Consider the Lobster** by David Foster Wallace. This is my first dip into his non-fiction after reading Infinite Jest last year. I'm really enjoying it so far - he has a very analytical perspective. I think I may also read **The Hounds of Baskerville** alongside it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work from home and I have a very deadline-intensive job, so there are often weeks where I am so insanely busy that I don't even have time to think about taking breaks - I've been trying to force myself to take them anyways to cut down on stress, but I forget most of the time. And then there are slow times of the year when I can take a bit of time for myself during the day as long as everything's getting done. I think working remotely is the way of the future - I can focus so much better on my work without the distractions and drama of the office, and I never feel that unnecessary stress of someone peering over my shoulder. BUT I still almost managed to have a stress-induced seizure last month, so clearly I need to improve somewhere. </TEXT>

Considering how much clout Trump just lost with his major failure on health care, I doubt he'll get congress on board with funding the wall anyways. Your president is a lame duck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My two counterpoints, thought I largely agree, are:

 - The ACA is better than what we had before and it certainly is better than that AHCA would be.

 - More and more, people seem to be getting to the next "step", which is that universal healthcare is really the only thing better than what we have. Other changes / reversions to the old system are not popular. Universal healthcare is popular. So it seems to be working as that stepping stone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> However, none of those Republicans campaigned on the idea that they'd cover everyone and that everyone's premiums would go down, etc. Trump did. He backed them into a corner - Republicans in congress would have been fine with a straight repeal and working on a new system (probably not the smartest move, but it would have been doable in congress). Trump set expectations that were completely un-achievable under any Republican approach. It's lose-lose for them because of that. </TEXT>

Sure, this bill would have "repealed Obamacare", or at least would have let him say it did, but it was a piece of shit bill that would hurt his own voters. The Wall was supposed to be paid for by Mexico, if I remember correctly, but now it's in his 2018 budget. He just wants to be able to say he did what he said he was going to do, but doesn't care at all about whether those are actually good things to do, or about how he gets them done. </TEXT>
