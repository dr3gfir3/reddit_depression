	<TEXT> It's probably a good time to bring up the subject of reform. If crossbenchers or the ALP raise the subject, they'd get a lot of support from the grassroots industry.

There's been enough collusion between the MBA and the LNP that even the builders themselves have had enough.


A senior executive of a major construction company has strongly criticised the Master Builders Association and the Fair Work Building Commission, accusing them of running a political propaganda campaign to portray the industry as corrupt.

Lou Raunik, a director of national building company, Icon Co, wrote a letter to fellow construction industry representatives saying he would not renew his membership of the Master Builders Association this year because it had failed to serve the interests of its members.

"It now places a higher priority and greater emphasis on maintaining a close relationship with the Liberal Party by feeding the narrative of the political agenda of the day rather than understanding the real issues we as members and industry participants face on a daily basis, and advocating on our behalf," he said.

	<TEXT> So we have data showing that lowering corporate tax had:

* No effect on wage growth.

* Increased unemployment.

* No effect on GDP.

* Increased public debt.


That makes it very clear that while capital is highly mobile, so are the profits that capitalists take from a nation's people. The only result of lower corporate taxes is increasing public debt, and eventually, reduced services and security.

No thanks.

	<TEXT> Sweden began progressively reducing corporate taxes from 2009, dropping from 28% to 22% in 2016. 

In 2010, unemployment was almost triple 2008 figures, and by the start of 2017 has gradually drifted down to roughly double unemployment (compared to 2008). 

Wage growth was completely linear for that entire period.


It doesn't seem like anything's trickled through those fat fingers yet. How long do Swedish workers have to wait?

	<TEXT> Do you know who has low corporate taxes? The Nordic countries.



Australia raises 4.3 percent of GDP from corporate income tax, Denmark raises slightly less at 3 percent and Sweden raises a little less again at 2.6 percent of GDP. Norway is the exception with corporate revenue equal to 8.5 percent of GDP. 

Like Australia, Norway is situated on large reserves of natural resources (eg, oil   gas) but unlike Australia, charges companies a corporate income tax rate of 66 percent to extract the oil.

I agree that Australia should follow Norway's model. </TEXT>

Two distinctly different failure modes for each of the Note7's batteries 

 Unintended damage to the negative electrode windings consistently in the corner of the cell closest to the negative tab.

Poor welding causes tall welding defects. Normal swelling forces those welds into the negative electrode. During high states of charge, the heating of the cell causes thermal runaway.

They are saying that the battery system, and its electronic safety measures to address issues like short circuits, met or exceeded industry standards, and that **Samsung's electronics did not contribute to the failure of either Company A or Company B's battery cells.**

	<TEXT> Greens policy was strongly anti-metadata retention, and there was an opportunity to support them by voting in July 2016. That didn't happen. 

Scott Ludlam in March 2015:

"The act that we are amending today was written in 1979, under the prime ministership of the recently passed Malcolm Fraser," he observed.

"Mobile phones only existed in Star Trek. The internet was unthinkable for all but a handful of researchers and futurists. Fast-forward to 2015: there are more mobile phones than people in this country and the internet is busily infusing nearly every corner of our lives.

"Every one of these devices, seen and unseen, generates a cloud of information in the course of its ordinary operation. One single tweet 140 characters long is the tip of a small iceberg of code that runs to about a page and a half,"

"Your phone handset is essentially a tracking device that allows you to make phone calls. Our relationships and our social lives are increasingly mediated by digital tools. 

"Collectively, these devices and apps silently generate billions of records of place, time, contact, data type and volume, all of it aggregated under this loose concept of 'metadata'. Anyone who tells you that these are simple billing records or the innocent envelopes surrounding substantive communications is either technically illiterate or lying to your face," Ludlam said.

And there are some numbers that are truly scary.

"In 2012-2013, agencies made around 340,000 demands for this information from Telstra, Optus and the rest of the telecommunications industry, without the trouble of having to apply for a single warrant," 

"Now, I do not have more recent numbers than that because the Attorney-General's Department is refusing to publish the report for the last financial year. Telecommunications regulator the ACMA reports 748,000 warrantless authorisations were received by carriers in 2013-14."

Using 95 from my local independent doesn't trigger the stalls, and I've learned to be careful where I buy.


I wonder if it's possible for petrol stations to "accidentally" adulterate 95 with 91? </TEXT>

Consumers pay for power privatisation

Electricity privatisation has failed to deliver cheaper power to consumers and has not improved the sector's efficiency, a new analysis by The Australia Institute has found.

The analysis shows that since Victoria privatised power in the 1990s, electricity prices have outpaced inflation, increasing by 170 per cent compared with an increase of 60 per cent in the consumer price index.

The malware is a Perl script that unpacks and runs a Mach-O binary and an Apple-specific Java class file. On Linux the Perl script might run, but would do nothing.


This is the extent of the "Linux compatibility".

it has code to do this both using the Mac screencapture command and the Linux xwd command. It also has code to get the systems uptime, using the Mac uptime command or the Linux cat /proc/uptime command.


Note that neither of those commands are specific to Linux, and both would work on OSX... </TEXT>

Open source code known as libjpeg, which the malware uses to open or create JPG-formatted image files, was last updated in 1998.

Maybe on the Mac, but Linux uses libjpeg-turbo, which has had a number of security updates, including some in the past 12 months (Last Update: 2016-11-03). libjpeg hasn't been updated because it's long obsolete.

	<TEXT> I once made the mistake of bringing my kelpie (Australian sheep dog) when I went to collect some emu eggs. I parked the ute, checked that the daddy emu wasn't there, and got into the nest to grab the eggs.


I didn't notice the dog had vanished until I heard the very loud drumming sound of a very close, very angry male emu. The bloody dog had got bored, found the emu, rounded it up and herded it back to me.

I dropped the bag, and covered the distance back to the car faster than Usain Bolt would have, hearing the thudding of the big bird's feet behind me. I jumped up into the back of the ute, then had to race the emu from side to side trying to open the door before it ran around the car.

Meanwhile, the dog had flopped down under a shrub, and was watching the entertainment with a big grin and occasional encouraging bark, presumably for the emu.

TLDR: don't bring a hyperactive herding dog to a sneaky egg theft. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To justify the NBN raids, the AFP used section 70(1), an obsolete, overly broad law that makes it a crime for a "Commonwealth officer" to publish or communicate to anyone else any fact or document which they know or possess "by virtue of being a Commonwealth officer".

The AFP has intentionally restricted powers. It can only investigate crimes under Commonwealth laws, and there aren't that many of those. To evade those restrictions, they are using section 70(1) so they can investigate activities that should be outside their jurisdiction. 

An example is this one:

The AFP has been conducting an investigation of Dr Peter Young, the former medical director of mental health services for our offshore immigration detention centres, after he commented publicly and critically about the medical care of asylum seekers and particularly the horrible and completely avoidable death of Hamid Khazaei.


These are the actions of a politicised entity dutifully searching for a legal loophole that would allow them to fulfill a request from their political masters, not the actions of an independent organisation.

One of the more common (and absolutely correct) benefits of the state based ICACs so far is their ability to compel people to testify in open session. This allows for transparency and oversight, and reduces the opportunity to erode the commission's independence.  </TEXT>
