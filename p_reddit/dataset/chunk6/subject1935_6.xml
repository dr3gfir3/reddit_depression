	<TEXT> So you make more than the national average. Here's the thing though, wages, especially entry level wages have become stagnated.

You also haven't mentioned your location or benefits. Someone living in the midlands on 40 - 50 grand with a company car, is going to see their wages go a lot further than most of the population, 1/4 of which live in the Dublin area.

Pretending that people owning flat screen TVs (where do you buy a non flat screen nowadays), phones (I got a smart phone free on my 2 year plan) or gym memberships are why they can't afford homes is just a distraction tactic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 'good' jobs you mentioned. The sort of job you could save for a deposit on and then make the repayments. I know the Centra in Tuam is looking for someone to work the deli. That is a job, but no one there will be buying a house in that position soon.

The job's problem isn't as bad as it was, but I still know people with two degree's just leaving their supervising job in Dunnes because the jobs market was so shitty for a while. 

And while Irish wages are still low in comparison to the cost of living, as soon as you leave Dublin, the wages are adjusted too. Basically if you want to own a house, you better marry the first person you touch genitals with, and both of you better have managerial jobs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is common. It was the same thing for those bendy iPhones a while back.

I get it though. Lets say this is something that slipped through QA. Lets say they tested durability for when you dropped your Switch and all the features of the dock, but didn't test the material against material properties. The hardware fitted the dock, what else is there to test?

Then the first week people have problems. If they come out and say 'Shit, the dock is scratching your unit? Fuck, we didn't test for that, our bad', then they have a lengthy and expensive recall case on their hands. They get all the docks back and realise the only reason it scratched was because people were putting it in backwards. Completely user fault. Well fuck, they admitted it was their fault, so they have to replace them anyway because people don't know that is something costs 300 dollars to treat it with some care.

So what Nintendo are likely doing now, is testing the unit to see if it really is easy to scratch. If they find that it is, what could happen is a recall or releasing a V2 model. 

No company is going to put itself on the line without knowing the full story first. What they do after is how we should judge them. If your friend says you scratched his car, you are going to have a look at the scratch before you take their word for it. If Nintendo go the Microsoft route with the XBox scratching disks, we will need to wait to see how the class action goes. If Nintendo acts like Nintendo after the Wii came out and admited people are throwing their Wiimotes into the TV, and they could be designed better, we will see a fix. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The leaks didn't get us any of these things. It gave us info that they were playing on a Men In Black Jump Street movie. It also said that there were internal discussions about a new Spiderman reboot, but that doesn't really mean much either.

I could email my boss tomorrow and tell him we could make more money selling ice cream because all the kids are big into ice cream these days. He might send me back a polite email saying that isn't the direction he sees our truck hire company going, or maybe even might humour me. That would count as internal discussion but it doesn't mean shit.

Spiderman got put in the MCU because Disney were desperate for it and Sony wanted to still make money off it without getting a bad rep for making Spiderman as enjoyable as diarrhoea, so it happened with or without the leaks. 

What we did get was that the perceived casual racism and sexism of the audience is still a factor in decision making in Hollywood. Oh, and a sub par Rogen - Franco comedy that was probably going to be shelved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would disagree. She gets a message from upon high from the beacon, she can understand languages others can't (something the apostles could) and she is herding together people from different backgrounds, etc. The bad guy is called Saren Arterius, which sounds a bit like Satan. That last one is a bit of a push. 

I think the first time she gets near the beacon was originally suppose to represent the resurrection. Then they started the second game with Shep dying and being brought back to life because maybe it wasn't obvious enough. I say this because the death was really unnecessary and seems like a really convoluted way to explain why Shep would be working for Cerberus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just looked it up. It has endings for different in-game stories. So it's not 100's of endings, just 100's of combinations. You could argue ME3 has the same. You can cure the Genophage, destroy the Geth, Wrex, etc. I mean it would be possible for the devs to move all the outcomes so they appear at the end of the game and not when the mission completed but what's the point? Those stories finished and they got their ending at the logical time, not pushed to the end so the devs can claim their are 100's of possible endings, when reality there is a set number of endings for story branches combined together. That's cheap. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cured the genophage because I didn't want to be Space Hitler. Did people need more motivation than that? Don't be a Space Hitler.

Honestly the genophage subplots was one of the best stories they continued through series. It was done well, made sense and had finality. The Collectors work for the Reapers was a bit forced. Also by killing Shep they lost the Beacon visions and Shep's ability to understand the Prothean AI and other abilities. These were way better than the resurrecting Shep plot which never was fully explained to satisfaction and only existed to force a Christ metaphor. The only thing it did for the story was force a Cerberus alliance, which didn't really make sense either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The game has a fake gameplay mechanic that doesn't do anything ("galactic readiness")

I agree with this point. I wish it translated to the battle going on, but it just meant more ending options were open.

But the ending worked fine. It wasn't as terrible as people made out in my opinion. I think they really fubbed the execution. The Citidal explains what will happen with each choice and that is the ending. People wanted a bit of what that means for the galaxy but you play Shepard. You followed their quest and that was the point it ended.

The third game was easily the weakest story wise and I think the real problem was that it had to be the end of a trilogy to a series of games that weren't really a trilogy. If the second game had more Reaper focus it might have felt like a trilogy but in reality the third game is a sequel to the first game and the second game is Shep on some different adventure that they force reapers into at the end.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it was just a crappy ending. three games full of complicated choices boiled down to three buttons. 

Man, you are really giving credit where it is not due. Most of the game gave you choices but they were very superficial. If it was a big universe changing choice, they made sure not to show you that part of the universe again. Really the only thing most of your choices meant was if one character would appear or another in a scene and a few different snippets of dialoge. 

The ending was fine, it made sense and closes out Shepard's Christ story.

I think a lot of people didn't like how the original ending didn't expose what happened next. All the DLC seemed to add was a little bit more exposition, which was appreciated but really just a recap of what the Citidal told you. </TEXT>

The other option is to find an auction, put a reserve on it, hope interested collectors turn up and bid on it. That could take months. After that, the auctioneer and whoever else take a cut, if it sells. 1200 bucks minus fees and time in a year from now or 600 cash straight up. People know this is their choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  1) That Irish is not fit for the contemporary world.
 
 
 
 2) That no effort should be made to support it; in politics, in education, or in the media.
 
 
 
 3) That efforts to support it are only a money-grab.
 
 
 
 4) That people who do speak it, actually do not.

I have never heard any of these strawmen in life.


1) The arguments are that there are other languages that would be more worthwhile

2) People are more sour at the current efforts to support it where people leave school with the same level of fluency as they started and yet no efforts have been made to change this. If people forgot Maths or English or Science at the same rate they do Irish, there would be a national education crisis. For Irish it is business as usual.

3) People might say this, but I think Irish language spending is pretty small. I'm no expert does it fall under cultural spending, like the arts? 

4) This is the biggest BS. Who have you honestly heard say that people are only pretending to speak Irish?


I think there is overwhelming support for the language. But most of that support comes from people who can't be bothered to learn it themselves. People who say 'I wish I paid more attention in class because it is part of our heritage' and then insist it stay compulsory so that their child and others spend hours in class showing the same apathy they had. At the same time they won't go to one of the bazillion adult Irish language classes out there showing that they don't really care about the language and only really care about the Nationalistic Pride they feel by saying they support it.

I think very few people want to eradicate the language. A lot of people may want it taught as a historical subject, rather than a second language. Our current system seems to be under the impression that they are teaching conversational Irish and I think it is fair to say that without going to a Gealtacht camp or school and without parents who are relatively fluent, most students would be lucky to hold a conversation longer than ordering a pint 1 year after school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  (except for all the people that do speak it everyday without much issue in that regard, who are apparently not real at all) and that therefore it should ditched entirely

I don't think anyone has ever suggested it be ditched entirely, as in people just stop speaking it. The current educational system doesn't seem to contribute anything towards the number of Irish speakers in the world so a lot of people think it is a waste of time at schools. The fluent speaks all seem to come from fluent families. Fluent speakers without that background are rarer. You make it sound like people are asking people to stop using the language entirely from day to day usage (yes I know some employers have asked people only to speak English in certain businesses).

And as for the practicalities, it was never really a practical language. It was far too divided with too many dialects. People from Donegal couldn't always understand people from Cork, Galway or Meath, even though they were speaking the same language. The people who brought the language to schools knew this and created a codified version of Irish which is about as natural as Esperanto. People can speak it, but it wasn't a natural language evolution. It was made up from bits all around the country so kids could learn a language that was historically never spoken that way by anyone.  </TEXT>

It's not like everyone thinks the Tara Broach is a shit piece of jewellery because they can get Hello Kitty earrings at Claire's or that the Book of Kells isn't as good as Gone Girl because it only sold one copy.

If anything Ireland are the first to opposite culture cringe. They are quick off the mark to celebrate James Joyce or U2's global success and to celebrate Irish heritage on any global figure (Barry O'Bama).

Maybe there was a time when we shifted to an English speaking nation that your wiki link would be applicable, but you really can't say that today, unless under some faux jingoistic furor. </TEXT>

They also need to defend their trademarks. If they look like they don't care about Indiana Jones any more, a court could technically rule that Indy is now fair game because Disney have shown no interest in retaining copyright. In reality though the courts and laws always work in favor of big IP owners like Disney. Disney themselves have stopped anything new transferring to the public domain for years. They aren't going to stop that now. If the law never changed, any studio could be doing Star War sequels now. </TEXT>

A private firm should be beholden to unions and in company bureaucracy as well. They would also probably end up hamstrung by local political interests too. As for competitors, the routes are usually sold/rented with a no compete clause. They specifically buy exclusivity. If they do share routes, they end up colluding more than competing. I'm pretty sure the Galway - Dublin route has two operators and they always charge the same prices. If the price of one goes up, so does the other. </TEXT>

That's as weak as saying 'I can't be racist, I have black friends'. When I was a teenager, I knew a girl who was telling me she cut herself, but she wasn't like the other girl who cut herself because they wore short sleeves so she was only 'doing it for attention'.

You see, you shouldn't care what a person's motivation for seeking therapy is. I don't care if someone thinks they need it because they felt bummed out all day because the barista fucked up their order in Starbucks that morning or because their dog died. Both of those people are saying they need help and are getting it. If something trivial can fuck up your day, you probably have something else going on. Sometimes you need consulling services to find out why getting the wrong coffee is a catalyst.

Lots of people who need therapy don't get it, because there are other people with 'real problems'. Fuck that shit, you can take asprin if you are hungover (brought on yourself, entirely your fault) or if you have a cold (probably not your fault). Same goes for therapy. It's not like all therapy is chemo level of medicine that works only for the really sick. It comes in different levels and different dosages.

	<TEXT> Private operator will probably think the route isn't worth it, not profitable.

I think there is a real problem with public services being sold off. A lot of people think governments shouldn't be operating businesses. This idea has gotten popular so we see public services being sold off to private companies. What inevitably happens is that only the profitable parts get sold. So in the UK they have private train services, but the maintenance of tracks still belong to the government. So now tax payers are paying to keep the unprofitable parts of businesses afloat while private operators can make money or drop routes when they start losing money.

Can't we use profitable parts of the business to fund the unprofitable parts in the public sector. This doesn't fully apply to BE but I see so many people think privatization is the answer to every single government org. Except water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the fact that they are double dipping on selling tickets (first the initial cost of the ticket, then the Seatwave fees) is a legitimate reason for legislation.

There is also more. If someone bought all the potatoes in Ireland and decided to hoard them so only they could sell them, the government would step in. Or what if they set up a system that gave public access in limited bursts, and that system was set up in a way that made it easy for a few people to buy a large percentage of the potatoes so they could resell them at inflated prices. Then they took a cut of the resellers profits, so they were essentially getting money twice for the same product. Oh and in some cases, this cut is bigger than the initial selling price. And the farmer and the owner of the field see none of that.
