	<TEXT> Cozumel is likely the safest place to visit in Mexico, if you're concerned about that. The entire island is built on tourism and the government does well to ensure safety. If you want to visit Cancun for a day, you're able to take a ferry over. 

Cozumel has just about anything and everything you would want to do. You're able to walk the beaches for a few miles, there's a great downtown area full of shops and restaurants, depending on where you stay you can hop from one hotel's bar to another. The scuba/snorkeling is gorgeous. 

Every person I've ever met in Cozumel has been amazingly friendly. I've been there multiple times during the last decade and haven't felt threatened or unsafe at any point.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At any store, unless you're paying in cash and don't use store loyalty cards, everything from what you buy or might buy to how much you spend is marketable data. Those store loyalty cards are just an easy way for customers to willingly hand over their information, all for the low cost of a small store discount here or there. Even without them, your credit card habits say a lot about you.

You honestly wouldn't believe how deep the social media targeting goes. Have an elderly mother that you visit in a nursing home? We know. Have a new teen driver in your family? We know. Just refinanced your home? We know that too. There have been very few times I wasn't able to find a target that matched what I was looking for.

Seriously, why does this surprise anyone? Not that I agree with it, but it shouldn't be shocking to people, especially you guys, that *all* of your activity on Reddit is monitored.  </TEXT>

The others who are second-most affected by this attack at the moment. I'm in the comfort of my home miles away and can only imagine what their loved ones are going through at the moment. It's not for people like me, it's out of respect for them. After families have been notified I think it's fair to share all photos, but right now, no one needs to find out their loved one is dead through Reddit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's avoid sharing photos of the critically wounded and deceased out of respect for now. This is still a very new story and I'm sure there are lots of people worried about their family members.  

Edit: this went from +30 to downvoted heavily within a few minutes. I feel sorry for those who lack the empathy to delay spreading images of the dead until all family has been notified. I sincerely hope none of you ever have to go through what those who were attacked, or their loved ones, are going through now.  </TEXT>
