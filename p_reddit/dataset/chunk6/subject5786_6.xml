	<TEXT> Well, the Democrats gave him 3 hearings.  They are just forcing the nominee to receive 60 votes is all.  And they are doing it in response to what the Republicans did.  It would be wholly wrong only if they did it purely to steal the seat as the Republicans did.  

Can you understand at least how I'd arrive at that conclusion and how it differs from the Republicans' treatment of Garland?

Last point: in game theory, a player who does not retaliate 100% of the time will lose 100% of the time.  Sometimes it is necessary to retaliate; certain actions bear consequence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's my only reservation: that it'll be in vain.  But the Republicans' stealing of the seat is so reprehensible and so damaging to the institution of the Senate, I see no value in rolling over for them and confirming to them that what they did was acceptable.  If they do, they're basically gambling that the GOP will respect the confirmation of Gorsuch and will ratchet down their partisan behavior in response.  I don't see that happening.

Democrats need to stand on their principle here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not a childish response, and there's a lot lost in your 'period'.  Gorsuch will be confirmed if and only if he can receive 60 votes.  If the GOP nukes the rule to force through a nominee that cannot gain 60 votes, who was nominated by a President under FBI investigation only after the Republicans stole the seat, that's on them.  The country will know, that's on them.

And if they'd use the nuclear option under this situation, they'd use it for the next nominee if they wanted, too.  

Republicans are trying to play a game where they fix the rules and can change them to fit their political whim.  Democrats should not acquiesce. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But Mr Smith appeared to speak for many of his fellow party members on the committee:

 Far too often, alarmist theories on climate science originate with scientists who operate outside the principles of the scientific method, he said in his opening statement.

 The [scientific method] avoids speculation about distant events for which there is no hard proof.

 Alarmist predictions amount to nothing more than wild guesses. 

 The ability to predict far into the future is impossible. Anyone stating they know what the climate will be in 500 years or even at the end of the century is not credible.

 All too often scientists ignore the basic tenets of science in order to justify their claims.

 Their ultimate goal is to promote a personal agenda, even if the evidence doesn't support it.

This is what it looks like to know nothing and be proud of it.

 Professor David Titley, a retired US Navy admiral, wrote in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/03/28/credible-climate-scientists-need-to-boycott-biased-congressional-hearings/?utm_term=.b53526943293) ahead of the hearing: This hearing, whose witnesses consist of one mainstream climate scientist and three other witnesses whose views are very much in the minority, is remarkably similar in structure and scope to the climate hearing Senator Ted Cruz conducted in December 2015 titled Data or Dogma? So similar that two of the five witnesses from the Cruz hearing will also testify.

 In the past, the science community has participated in these hearings, even though questioning the basics of climate change is akin to holding a hearing to examine whether the Earth orbits the Sun. Enough!

This is what it looks like to know things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The awkwardly named Best Sunshine Live hardly looks like a high-roller hub. Construction workers bet $5 or $10 at a time on roulette and baccarat in a fug of nicotine. Clustered in a far corner are a handful of tables for so-called VIP gamblers, which at 8:30 p.m. on a September Saturday are almost empty. A nearby bar has just a couple of patrons.

 Its a power list that includes a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and three former U.S. governors, including past chairmen of both the Democratic and Republican National Committees. Behind them all: a Donald Trump protege, **Mark Brown, who ran the Republican president-elects Atlantic City casino empire** and is now Imperial Pacifics chief executive officer. 

 The revenue figures, or actual wins by the house, are just a fraction of total bets. In September, Imperial Pacific reported a record $3.9 billion in bets at its casinomeaning the 100 or so high-rollers who it says come through its doors monthly each wagered an average of $39 million.

Trump and Brown fail miserably at running a legit casino in Atlantic City, so instead they get a fake casino and just launder money through it.  Brilliant! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Senate Intelligence Committee leaders are urging the White House to turn documents related to their Russia investigation directly over to the panel, seemingly declining an invitation to examine intelligence reports at the White House. 

 A spokesperson for the Senate committee said the Trump administration should instruct the agencies who have the relevant documents to provide them directly to its members, which would cut out the White House as an intermediary. 

I don't think Burr really had a choice here.  He wouldn't want to get caught pulling a Nunes at this point.  

It's worth noting though for additional context that Burr is one of the guys who offered to ["push back"](https://www.axios.com/exclusive-spicer-arranged-sat-in-on-cia-gop-intelligence-push-back-2288082248.html) on the press when the Trump-Russia 'constant contact' stories first broke.  On the surface at least it looks like Burr is going the opposite way of Nunes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree to a point.  You don't need to stay abreast of the latest political news to be informed about how physical reality works, for example.  You can be completely disconnected from the media and still understand the concept of climate change.  Subjects which are studied primarily by scientists or even engineers are regularly distilled down into easily digestible knowledge and it's fairly simple to stay up-to-date with what's true and what's false as concerns the world around you.

Also, if people are not informed, they should realize their opinion is uninformed and has not been touched by 90% of the information that is out there.  I have no problem with people not staying up to date and not consuming information, but I do have a problem when people do so and then are offended when their opinion is criticized or are unwilling to accept new information or arguments.

 We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russias goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.  

 We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trumps election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the best parts of this hearing, from Watts:

 SENATOR: My question is, first, why did [Putin] think he could get away with it this time?  This is not new for the Russians.  They have done this for a long time across Europe.  But it was much more engaging this time in our election.  Why now?  Mr. Watts?

 WATTS: I think this answer is very simple and it is what no one is really saying in this room, which is part of the reason active measures have worked in this US election, is because the commander-in-chief has used russian active measures at times against his opponents </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Kansas Governor Sam Brownback on Thursday vetoed a bill expanding eligibility for Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA), saying he could not support legislation that provided tax dollars to Planned Parenthood.

 State lawmakers in the Republican-controlled senate voted in favor of the measure on Tuesday, just days after President Donald Trump's efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, also known as Obamacare, ended with the bill being pulled from a vote.

Yeah, wouldn't want those federal dollars to go to improve the health of your citizens at really no cost to your state.  What a shitty ideologue of a governor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Somehow, some way, more blame the House Democrats than Republicans, aka, they continue to be scammed.

 Among Republicans in the survey, 26 percent blame the bill's defeat on House Democrats, while another 23 percent say House Republicans are at fault. Only 13 percent blame Trump for the failure, and even fewer  10 percent  say it's Ryan's fault.

 The plurality of respondents that placed the blame on House Democrats fall in line with Trump's own assertion that Democrats were ultimately responsible for blocking the measure. In fact, Trump never courted Democratic votes on the measure. </TEXT>

A sign of things to come.  Most of the GOP still thinks Trump can be bent to their will and that his version of politics is no more vindictive or vengeful than theirs, and I don't understand why.

	<TEXT>  Mr. Trumps 2013 lease with the General Services Administration stipulates that no elected official shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom. Legal experts say the president is clearly in violation of that clause and the government should either terminate the lease or force Mr. Trump to transfer it to somebody else. On Thursday, however, an agency contracting official, Kevin Terry, declared that the president was not in violation because he had agreed not to receive any profits from the hotel until after he leaves office.  
  
 Mr. Terry engages in legal gymnastics that no lawyer could credibly defend. It should not matter when Mr. Trump accepts the profits from the hotel; he benefits even if he waits until after he leaves the White House to pocket them. Mr. Terry argues that as long as Mr. Trumps profits are reinvested in the hotel, rather than deposited in his bank account, there is no violation. But by reinvesting the profits, Mr. Trump is increasing the value of the hotel and its ability to earn more money in the future. He has a 60-year lease on the building, and not pocketing profits for a few years is hardly a sacrifice.  

This seems like a pretty thin and indefensible legal argument to a layman like me.

Article ends on a sobering note:
 Meanwhile, the Republican-controlled Congress is unwilling to force the president to divest or even to investigate his businesses and finances. A recently filed lawsuit, invoking the Constitution, asks a federal court to bar him from accepting profits from foreign governments. In addition, the Cork Wine Bar in Washington had sued Mr. Trump. The bars owners argue that they have lost business because Mr. Trumps hotel possesses a fundamentally illegal advantage.  
  
 Until Congress does its job, such lawsuits may be the only avenue of protest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It is not just that Donald Trump is an egomaniac. Most presidents have a pathological need for approval and attention. Its why they suffer the slings and arrows that come with seeking the countrys top office. Egomania is for Hollywood actors and House committee chairmen who think the rule of law doesnt apply to them. Trump is a Transcendental Solipsist. It is not just that he has a strong sense of self. His view of the universe does not extend a single inch beyond the boundaries of his own interests. That is why normative concepts like truth or commonly held values or the national interest are completely alien to him. There is Trump world, and then there is oblivion.  
  
 Of course, the fact that our president is so psychologically broken would not automatically mean that the rest of us would become infected with a new, Trumpian me-me-me-ism. No, perhaps the sole notable achievement of his record-breakingly bad first couple of months in office has been his ability to make his pathology our pathology, by invoking the multiplicative principle of narcissism. If you take a nation of narcissists and place the ur-narcissist at their center of attention and he behaves in a way that makes it impossible for them to look away then all of a sudden we become like him, the world falls away, the universe evaporates, and we enter whatever is the opposite of the Buddhist ideal of enlightenment. Unlightenment? This is Transcendental Solipsism. Its all about us being all about him being all about himself.

	<TEXT> The only option is to change the rules to confirm someone for *life* who was nominated by a President under FBI investigation?  That sounds really really unreasonable and like it will not be remembered well historically. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not like I doubt that extremists on the left do this, or that it has never occurred.  But do you doubt that hate-crimes actually genuinely happen?

That site you linked is interesting but it has 296 incidents (at least according to the # in first column which I assume is an ID).  In 2015 there were [5,818 hate-crimes](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2015-hate-crime-statistics-released), so you can understand why I wouldn't think every hate-crime is a hoax, no?

Also, it's weird (but fine) that you started a new thread instead of just continuing from the thread from your previous reply.  Was it so people visiting this in the future won't have to go to the bottom of the thread to see that site? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I surely didn't.  I said they haven't been solved yet, and that's it.  And again, there were other incidents besides the Brooklyn one like the one in St. Louis.  What exactly is your animus towards me for? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "I felt like I had a duty and obligation to tell him, because as you know hes taking a lot of heat in the news media and I think to some degree there are some things he should look at to see whether in fact he thinks the collection was proper or not, Nunes said.

Clear admission of a political, partisan motive.  In what way is the HIC obliged to brief the WH?  There should be separation and independence from the executive.

And how does he not see the issue with an investigator giving information to the subject of the investigation before the rest of his team? </TEXT>
