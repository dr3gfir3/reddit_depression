	<TEXT> From  Peter Schweizer's article,

 Bill and Hillary Clinton received large sums of money directly and indirectly from Russian officials while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.  Bill Clinton was paid a cool $500,000 (well above his normal fee) for a speech in Moscow in 2010.  Who footed the bill?  An investment firm in Moscow called Renaissance Capital, which boasts deep ties to Russian intelligence.  The Clinton Foundation itself took money from Russian officials and Putin-connected oligarchs.  They also took donations from:

    Viktor Vekselberg, a Putin confidant who gave through his company, Renova Group
     Andrey Vavilov, a former Russian government official who was Chairman of SuperOx, a research company that was part of the nuclear Cluster at the Russian governments Skolkovo research facility
     Elena Baturina, the wife of the former Mayor of Moscow, who apparently gave them money through JSC Inteco, an entity that she controls

 Then there is the glaring fact that the Clinton Foundation also scored $145 million in donations from nine shareholders in a Canadian uranium company called Uranium One that was sold to the Russian government in 2010. The deal required the approval of several federal government agencies, including Hillary Clintons State Department. The deal allowed Rosatom, the Russian State Nuclear Agency, to buy assets that amounted to 20 percent of American uranium.  Rosatom, by the way controls the Russian nuclear arsenal.

 Equally troubling: some of those donations were hidden and not disclosed by the Clintons. President Obama required the Clinton Foundation to disclose all contributions as a condition of Hillary Clinton becoming Secretary of State. But that did not happen. The only reason the hidden donations ever came to light is because we uncovered them by combing through Canadian tax records.

 Everyone got what they wanted in this deal: the uranium investors made a nice profit; the Russians acquired a strategic asset; and the Clinton Foundation bagged a lot of money.

 Hillary Clinton says she was not involved in the decision to approve the sale of Uranium One.  As proof, the Clinton campaign in 2015 trotted out her former aide, Assistant Secretary of State Fernandez, to say publicly that we should take his word for it that she was not involved in approving that deal. But as we now know from the leaked Podesta emails, Fernandez was all too eager to help Podesta kill the story, while getting other favors from Podesta.  That raises questions about the veracity of his comments. 

 It seems strange that while some in Congress are eager to investigate the activities of General Mike Flynn and his contacts with Russia, they have no interest in looking into a transaction in which the Clinton Foundation received a staggering $145 million. Its that kind of inconsistency that saps all credibility from those raising these issues.

 Beyond the Clintons themselves, there is also the troubling case of one of their closest aides, John Podesta. He served as Hillary Clintons 2016 campaign chairman. Podesta didnt just have conversations with Russian officials. He went into business with the Russian government while he was advising Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.

 In 2011, John Podesta joined the executive board of a small energy company called Joule Unlimited.  Two months after he joined the board, the Russian government invested one billion rubles (approximately $35 million) into the company. The money came from a Russian government investment fund called Rusnano. What is Rusnano? It is a fund started in 2007 by Vladimir Putin and has been described by Russian Education and Science Minister Andrei Fursenko as Putins Child.

 According to State Department cables leaked via Wikileaks, technology venture funds like Rusnano were considered a national security concern by U.S. officials because they could serve a dual use in their investments. That is, their investments in civilian technologies could have a military application.

 In short, John Podesta was business partners with the Russian government and Vladimir Putin.  When John Podesta went to the White House in January 2014 to serve as counselor to President Obama, he failed to disclose his board membership in one of the Joule entities on his financial disclosure form. According to the Podesta emails, Podesta transferred his 75,000 shares in the company to an LLC controlled by his family. But as the Wall Street Journal notes, the Podesta emails reveal he remained actively engaged in company business after that fact. </TEXT>

Not all are bad but the good ones generally don't have much influence within the government. When I say establishment, I include the people operating behind the curtains like the CIA, and the even more secretive people who decide which politicians will run for president every four years and be supported by the party and the media, ensuring that whoever wins will be a puppet and not a free thinker. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as making pizza at home goes, if you like New York crust buy some All Trumps flour and proof the dough for a couple of days, then cook it on a regular aluminum pizza tray near the bottom of the oven. Grande Mozzarella is quite popular in pizza restaurants and can be found in some delis or ordered online from Pennmac. Sauce is easy enough - Cento crushed tomatoes plus some seasoning, maybe precooked.

If it's Chicago deep dish you like, I experimented with that the other day and it turned out nearly perfect the first time. I used 13% bread flour and a ton of yeast and vegetable oil, then rolled the dough out and layered it in a cast iron skillet and baked at 400. </TEXT>
