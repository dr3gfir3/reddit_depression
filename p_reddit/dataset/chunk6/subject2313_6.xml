	<TEXT> The thing is though....there really isn't much debate about nutrition; A diet rich in vegetables and wholegrains, with added pasture raised meat (although meat is not necessary) and fish, has consistantly shown to be a superior choice to all other diets.

There is, in fact, a list of about 10 food items that can basically help you live to 100 years old if you follow a moderately strict diet.

Kale, Broccoli. Garlic/Onion (Allium vegetables), Salmon, Oats, Pomegranate, Turmeric, Mushrooms, Hemp oil

eat these 10 and you'll live to 100
