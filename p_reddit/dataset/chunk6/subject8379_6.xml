	<TEXT> BTW, here's the paper, and an example of the distortion tactic stuff: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/gch2.201600008/full

In the shorter, general version, respondents were first warned: some politically motivated groups use misleading tactics to try to convince the public that there is a lot of disagreement among scientists. This claim was then debunked by reiterating that scientific research has found that among climate scientists, there is virtually no disagreement that humans are causing climate change. In the longer, more specific inoculation condition, additional arguments were added to debunk the Oregon Petition specifically (e.g., by highlighting that some of the signatories are fraudulent, including Charles Darwin and members of the Spice Girls, that fewer than 1% of the signatories have a background in atmospheric/climate science, etc.). </TEXT>

when presented with an "inoculation"  where people were introduced to distortion tactics used by certain groups

That seemed to be really important to me, exposing the distortion tactics. I think that's a particularly good skill that skeptics carry.

The North American media, several experts said, did a good job debunking various myths that arose early in the epidemic, such as rumors blaming microcephaly on genetically modified mosquitoes, larvicide in drinking water or vaccines.
In Brazil, those rumors diverted attention for precious weeks, even prompting some cities to stop fighting mosquitoes temporarily.

	<TEXT> I strained my eye muscles rolling them back in my head. But I was roaring at how bad this was:
Glyphosate is of particular importance to the discussion surrounding pesticides due to its potential connection with gluten sensitivity and gluten intolerance, collectively referred to as celiac disease for the sake of simplicity. The connection between these conditions and wheat was only discovered within the last century, and their prevalence has grown rapidly over the last few decades. In 2013, a major study was published by MIT scientists linking celiac disease to glyphosate (Samsel   Seneff, 2013).

Utter nonsense in every syllable.

It's all been debunked elsewhere, it's essentially a huge Gish gallop. It's not like any debunking would make a difference for this guy. He's too deep. It's clearly not his field at all too.

Probably the sanest thing you can say to people like this is that the USDA tests these things. Our food is incredibly safe. https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/04/04/usda-annual-report-pesticide-residues-food-well-amounts-dangerous-humans/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't looked at the data from this paper yet, because I'm still trying to get them to answer questions on the previous one. But someone who does this work commented at the paper:

This analysis suffers from the same major statistical problem as http://www.nature.com/articles..., see my comment there http://disq.us/p/1f2l0qg. Finding statistical enrichment in levels of individual peptides does not mean that the full proteins they map to are enriched.

See as one of many examples GSTA3 in Supplementary File 3, whose individual peptides have fold changes: 1.250429086, 1.238484564, -1.01582587,-1.080276119, 1.137068576, -1.035566543, 1.042132243, -1.016641487, and 1.00619982. With half its component peptides enriched and half depleted, I doubt the full protein GSTA3 would be statistically enriched/depleted.

Instead, by using peptide difference as a false proxy for full protein differences, GSTA3 gets to be described as a disturbed protein, contributing to the statement:
"The alteration of glutathione metabolism (GO:0006749, FE=21.1, BH corrected p=1.1E5) is indicative that the liver of the Roundup treated animals are likely to have suffered from an increase in oxidative stress." even when its expression is likely not different between conditions.

Their flawed analysis from the original work (never mind the potentially contaminated samples used for feeding) means that they have some things that are both increased and decreased, at the same time. It's not how this work should be done.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1 year, almost exactly for our 9.1kW array.

Any unexpected project issues after commissioning?

A couple of times the inverter got wacky. Did a reboot, all sorted. But it was a good thing I was checking nearly daily on the dashboard interface. Might have lost a few days. A couple of odd messages from the software that didn't affect function. Sorted by installer. 

How has the array held up to snow/ice on the roof?

Yes. Just yesterday I was waiting for the huge WHOMP of it sliding off, this morning it's all clean after some rain last night. When it was really cold (15F) it wasn't sliding off on its own for about 3 days. But in the 20s usually it slides off within a day. 

Are you actively tracking your existing payback or do you trust the system well enough?

Actively tracking every dime. We are at 47.96% payback in the first year, and have 6 more SRECs in the hopper that were made in 2016 but not minted yet.

What would you do differently this time around?

Maybe a few more panels. And then I'd move a bit more of my other energy use to electric. Electric stove, for example.

Are you happy with going with the "high" or "low" bid?

I could have saved a bit going with a local Solarize campaign, but for other reasons I needed to do it earlier. I was satisfied with my payment, within local norms. And payback is coming exactly as predicted.

How did you come to be a solar owner?

Housemate (I live in a 2 family home) came home after hearing a work colleague's solar story. I had wanted to do it before, but kept waiting because I was told prices were falling. But if others were doing the math and it was coming up right at this point, it was time to pull the trigger. Also, I'm a biologist by training. I have real concerns about the climate. So primarily it was math, but it was also environment. 

Do you feel like the array adds to your property value or the opposite?

In our area it probably adds, because we have lots of enviro folks here. But we aren't ever leaving except in boxes, so it doesn't really matter to us.

Are you thinking about battery retrofits?

Yes. Our inverter life is ~10 years, we knew this going in. So I was hoping battery tech would improve in the meantime and the next round we'd do that. Also, I'm watching for state/utility programs for big beta tests or anything of that sort. I'd sign up earlier if something like that came along.

Any issues with debris, mold, or animal nesting "under" the array?

Not that we are aware of at this point.

Anyone ever experiment with using heat tape to melt snow off of the array?

Nope. We let all natural physics do the work. Temperature and gravity.

	<TEXT> Nah, people really just have no idea what they are talking about. They conflate all the issues, all the time. 

You have come across what we lovingly refer to as the "Asymmetric Advantage of Bullshit". http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/04/20/the-asymmetry-of-bullsh-t-and/

The rebuttal, by contrast, may require explaining a whole series of preliminary concepts before its really possible to explain why the talking point is wrong. So the setup is snappy, intuitively appealing argument without obvious problems vs. rebuttal I probably dont have time to read, let alone analyze closely.

Lately it's also called Brandolini's Law: http://ordrespontane.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/brandolinis-law.html?m=1

You can either decide to debunk with all the preliminary details, or not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, that's a good point about a power outage, and still having access to some heat. Hmm. 

That said, I was not really considering moving completely away from gas. What I am doing is offsetting some of my heating with electric space heaters. That didn't make sense when electricity cost more, but now that it's free to me, it does. 

And I've switched to some more electric cooking. I got an induction burner. I got a cool pressure cooker that does about 15 things. So I've reduced my natgas usage by about 15% so far. I think I can pare that down some.

If my stove breaks someday, I would consider replacing with electric. But I'm not going out of my way to just swap stuff out in general. Next water heater, though, heat pump should be a good choice.

I did oversize my array a smidge with the plan of buying an electric car, which I've now done. So that replaced my gasoline + oil.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone drove into my pole a few months back. The police determined it was the utility's pole. I never said that was the case for everyone. But in my city it is.

I also happen to live in the most dense city in the Northeast besides NYC, Somerville. We are full of street poles that run the power. I wish it was underground but it's not. 

And I know that it would require the city to work with them. But as I said, we just had a Solarize program which crossed boundaries among the different city divisions. Housing, Enviro, Mayor's office, Inspectional services and the utility--all worked together because our city values reducing greenhouse gasses. It's entirely possible to get this all aligned in my city, if we wanted to try it.

The most convenient places to locate EV charging is usually in a parking lot, too, not a residential street. 

And this is exactly the point. The homeowner doesn't own it the street space, so it's possible to use it for a community purpose. You can't expect people to drive to parking lots, charge for 3 hours, and then move their cars, from far away. It needs to be in the neighborhoods if you want to encourage adoption in high density areas.  </TEXT>

That is interesting, though. I've heard talk about programs to encourage EVs that are like the Solarize program my city recently ran. But I was telling the city folks that it would require charging access for non-homeowners. That's actually a good idea for a solution. It could be card access based like chargepoint, but to your own electric account.

I can't stop laughing that you need 9kW for 2 people too. That must be some big house you have there. 

Oh, and my project to get my neighbors solar also got over 500kW of solar in my community. It was so nice, and so satisfying. In our high-density area, people had such small array needs that the average was only 5kw.

But I bet they all have 7 bikes.  </TEXT>

You are free to ignore the reduction in pesticides that was clear from the NAS study. And I know--they were all paid off. 

You are free to ignore that farmers see yield increases and cost reductions. I've seen the data. Unlike you, I'm not resistant to facts and data. 

And farmers love to be called "dumbass" almost more than the like to be called rubes. You are a real charmer.

And we saw Bt resistance--wait for it--in 1994! Which was--wait for it--before GMOs! As I provided in the link, which you apparently can't read either. Do you... understand this? I think not. Can I help you with some math? 

But look--go ahead and try living your life against the scientific consensus. Stop vaccinating your kids. Watch the ocean flood Miami,  or the other seaside communities.

You really aren't very good at this.

But hey--maybe I just care about reducing pesticides more than you do. 

You can probably play dumb in your echo chamber. I'm sure that works fine for you. But please take your misinformation and conspiracy theories back there. It was horrifying to see the reaction that nonsense about the NAS being paid off by the guy who headed the panel. Fred Gould was so angry to be called a shill by that douchecanoe from Food and Water Watch that it was glorious to see him counter it. It's terrible the assault on academics who are doing their best to bring science to heated issues. I don't know how you sleep at night behaving like that if you actually pretend you care about the environment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um, you don't seem to have a good understanding of farming. Farmers choose to buy GMOs because they benefit their situation. They are not "beholden" to anybody and it really pisses them off that people imply that they are rubes.

And this is completely false: 
Now the non-GMO farmer is growing GMO plants which pisses off the agribusiness who sues the non-GMO farmer.

Never happened. When the organic farmers went to the courts, they were laughed out of their suit because not one farmer could be found that was threatened with this. 

Dave Goulson is funded by environmentalists, btw. From a farmer I know: "Curiously, no mention of financial support for Dave Goulson from anti-pesticide Friends of the Earth." Ideology distorts science, as any climate denier can demonstrate. But it gets a pass because it's perceived to be unaffected by money. But for money-raising enviro groups, that's very far from true.  </TEXT>

It mischaracterizes the confidentiality agreements pretty badly. Here's a better example of what they really are: https://twitter.com/WyoWeeds/status/815233710341623809

The dark photos made me laugh. If the factory runs at night in the dark, it must be nefarious, right?

And we were also perplexed by the "snake oil" bit. Everyone at r/skeptic has made the crack about how great it would be to have the skills of the MLMs and other nonsense peddlers to sell snake oil--while actual science is hard to interest anyone in. 

And Hilbeck is one of the Seralini cabal, yeah. She's a top consensus denier on GMOs. 

That said, it also is increasingly clear that they can't pin any of the safety things they've been claiming for years on GMOs, so their goal posts are moving.  </TEXT>

But I'm sure you know there isn't much I can do to help a conspiracy theorist out of their little ghetto. And GMWatch is a CT ghetto. I thought it was good of them to branch out in to Zika conspiracy theories this year. It's nice to have new hobbies. 

And your bacon issues are what we call an anecdote. The fact is that the IARC said that bacon is worse that glyphosate, but everyone dismissed that. It's not just you--everyone is confused by what the IARC does. http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-who-iarc/

	<TEXT> You really ought to align with the scientific consensus on matters that you don't really understand. I would recommend the National Academy report on GMOs that was recently issued. https://nas-sites.org/ge-crops/

And here's a tip: glyphosate is not a GMO. And there is no other scientific society that agrees on the IARC decision. Most people also misunderstand the IARC's mission as they continue to eat bacon, which came out worse than glyphosate. 

Your attempt to poison the well is sad--like a climate denier would--but I would encourage you to seek out all the academic scientists who can help you to understand the GMO issues better. Kevin Folta would be a great start for you. http://kfolta.blogspot.com/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been keeping track of the return on our investment based on the dollars we laid out, and what we are seeing in electricity savings, SRECs, and tax credits. We didn't factor in our roof issues. We don't expect hail issues. Our homeowners insurance policy may have gone up a smidge, but they used it as an opportunity to review our whole policy so it wasn't possible to extract the specific solar piece. 

We track every electric bill (we live in a 2-family house, so we have to track 2 bills). We have just completed our first full year with solar.

In our first 12 months, our return has reached 47.96%. It's biggest the first year because of the tax issues. But this also doesn't include 6 more SRECs we have in the hopper (because those will be minted in Jan 2017 but were technically generated in 2016).

It also doesn't include that I have shifted some of my natgas heating to electric space heaters, and some induction cooking and other electric cooking when I can. But a casual look at my gas usage suggests I've saved about 15% per month on average there. I think I can go up some too, but since this is our first year I didn't try to replace as much heating as I probably can.

Futher, I have now purchased an electric car and all my gasoline and oil expenses are replaced by my electrical outlet in the basement. I accomodated this in my plan, so I was overproducing solar already and I think I'll still cover all my electric needs. 

A lot will depend on your specific situation, your state's policies, and your needs. But we expect that by year 5 our initial investment should be recouped (barring any crazy Nevada-style monkey wrenching) and everything after that will be gravy. The panels should last more than 20 years. Our inverter will need replacing in 10ish years, but we many also add storage and want to replace that anyway. I am hoping for state programs on that too, though. 

TL,DR: we're happy with our return on the things we are tracking.  It's exactly as we expected and were told in our proposal so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The argument that I was making in that discussion was that you just don't make a snap decision to go EV. You have to think about this carefully. And footprint decisions are a huge factor in this--like yours have been and like mine have been too.

I got solar, and then replaced my 14 year old car with an all-electric car. But that was after I chose a place to live with high walkability and adequate public transportation. 

I also wish studies would look at lower driving miles of EVs, for the same reasons too. I think they (and the owners) are being held to the wrong standards because people don't know how to evaluate disruptive tech.  </TEXT>

[Are There Environmental Benefits from Driving Electric Vehicles? The Importance of Local Factors](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150897)

I have seen the data about how many EV owners have solar, but I also know of many who pay to purchase other clean energy like wind or hydro--because they are people who think about their impact.

Frustrating. These things persist and really can harm adoption. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have seen other work that challenges the "backfire" effect. I really don't know that we have a good grasp on this yet.

And this is why I continue to argue with professional scicomm folks. I don't think they have demonstrated really what works and what doesn't yet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, but there's 2 responses to it. The Trump response is to double down. Thoughtful people might actually react in a way that makes them re-examine their case. 

So I don't think it will work on everyone--but nothing does. We need to use many strategies for different purposes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting. I want to look at the paper details. But I am delighted to see my bias confirmed.

I've been arguing for a while that nobody is looking at ridicule because they just don't like to admit that it might work. There are other types of things that I try that other folks think are uncivil or not nice. But for some of the folks we are dealing with, they might just be effective. 

TheSciBabe's article about the FoodBabe being full of shit was a glorious success. But my tribe turned their noses up. Fine--you keep writing your head-patting kumbayah pieces. We'll take care of the FoodBabe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The one that I used (the Massachusetts one that I posted) worked perfectly as described in the MassEnergy program pages. They gave me a contact at the dealer whose pricing I saw--and the pricing and options didn't deviate from what was posted. They had cars in stock.

The dealership wanted to upsell on the financing thing--they were saying that I could get extra protection yatta yatta something. But I just said, "Do I need to have any of that?" They said no. So I said no. I'm not afraid to say no.

My experience was very good. And I actually preferred going in with the spreadsheet data and their stated committment to the pricing. And having the backing of this organization--a known enviro group in my area--gave me confidence in this.

I talked them up a teeny bit on my trade in. So there was a bit of room there. But my car was crap, there wasn't much to do about that.

But mostly I was afraid the next administration might get rid of federal incentives, so I acted more quickly than I might have otherwise. As I have read more about the pricing, though, I feel like mine was in line with others that I've read and I'm happy with it. 

I heard about this offer because I was the solar coach volunteer for my community. So this organization had reached out to me at an event. I am not associated with them, I was just aware of them from other work they do.

If I were you, I'd see if there's an EV owners group in your area, or ring up a couple of the local enviro groups. Somebody in Portlandia has to know.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you continue to make claims that your evidence can't cash. Not only do a large number of EV owners have solar, others of them buy green power. Some do both. You cannot say that the other half are using fossil fuels. 

Here's the thing: choosing an EV is not just picking between a Snickers and a Milky Way. The people choosing to do this are a strange bunch. They are often already environmentally making different sourcing choices. They buy green power (I know of one who sources all wind power, not accounted for in the solar survey). They drive fewer miles. They choose these cars for many reasons are are already doing things to reduce their local and global footprints. 

This is a theoretical model that discounts everything but the point they wish to make. And that point remains bogus.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's what the email said (in part):

Were happy to report that Drive Green with Mass Energy is going well. Weve already helped many folks get into new electric cars.

You expressed interest in the all-new Chevrolet Bolt. Heres an important and exciting update on how you can get a great all-electric car:

The very first Bolts were sold last week in California. Because California has a zero-emission vehicle mandate, it gets most of the attention from EV carmakers. After California and Oregon, Massachusetts is one of the hottest markets for EVs, so the Bolt will be here soon. Dealers who sell lots of Chevy Volts will get the most Bolts; that is the case with the dealers in Drive Green with Mass Energy. We believe the dealers in our program will get more Bolts (and sooner) than other dealers in Massachusetts. We are now estimating mid-February for the arrival of Bolts in Massachusetts showrooms.

Demand for the Bolt is going to exceed supply for a few months, so it will not be possible for everyone on our Bolt waiting list to get one for a while. We also do not expect big dealer discounts until supply catches up to demand. If you want to purchase a Bolt, the price will probably be very close the list price or MSRP of $37,500 for the LT trim and $41,780 for the Premier trim. Buyers of the Bolt will be able to receive a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 and a state rebate of $2,500. Leases will be available too, probably at about $300 per month.

There was more detail about how you might get into the queue. If anyone in MA is interested, I suggest you get on their mailing list for the updates and details. </TEXT>
