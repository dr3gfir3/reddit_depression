	<TEXT> One of the girls suggested all 3 of them attack Dennis at once, but Casey knew it wouldn't work. Even Patricia (the female personality) recovered really fast from being hit in the back with a chair. I think the only one they could have really overpowered was Hedwig. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is inspired by a recent discussion from when someone posted that abduction clip from Fire in the Sky. Looking back, how did the movie only manage to get a PG-13 rating? I mean, sure almost nothing happens for a large amount of the movie, but the abduction scene on the table is basically torture porn. The movie doesn't really have any blood or gore, but those torture scenes are absolutely horrifying to watch. Heck, I've even seen plenty of R-rated movies which don't even come close to being that graphic. The movie should have gotten an R-rating. Anyone else agree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shrek The Third is the most godawful piece of garbage I've ever seen...and I'll just leave it at that. Seriously, my hatred for that movie is almost irrational.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The dream sequence after the little girl falls and hits her head is the most bizarre and surreal piece I've ever seen in a movie. It really freaked me out when I first saw it, especially when she's a doll and they're opening her cracked head.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was the food on Pale Man's table supposed to be enchanted? No one would be that foolish to eat a grape on the table after seeing a pile of children's shoes in the corner, and pictures of that hideous frail thing eating children. Ofelia was really asking for it. </TEXT>
