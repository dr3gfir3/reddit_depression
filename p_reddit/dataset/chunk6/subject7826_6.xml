	<TEXT> One of the most important psychological cues for making immersive VR/AR actually work is accurate 3D placement of sounds, which means that both the engine and the plugin that you choose matter a lot. Here is a good overview of plugins that is still pretty current: http://designingsound.org/2015/04/3d-audio-weighing-the-options/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I was the translator for this book and I know that there will be a new version released. You should also be ok with the version for max 6 if you don't want to wait; the interface has changed quite a bit, but the fundamentals are the same. I don't know anything about the release schedule, unfortunately, so I have no idea how long the wait will be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any signal processing that you do on a computer involves buffering to a greater or lesser extent. In order to pull spectrum information from a signal, you need enough history to "perceive" the frequencies as you go. But just because this introduces a delay doesn't mean that you can't make music with it in real-time. Think of it like singing in a cathedral - you can make the reverb work for you! </TEXT>
