Obamacare is a compromise of the  Romneycare which was what Mitt did in Massachusetts which itself was a Republican compromise on a state level of the liberal Hillarycare from the 90's.

Seems coincidental that he or she posted this link and the good Senator's official reddit account posted a comment 10 mins later.

If you work for another Senator that is fine, i don't want to know who that is, just if that account is operated by a staffer of the Senator himself. </TEXT>

You were talking about qualified.

You mean to say somebody who was a Representative, Governor and VP is no more qualified to be POTUS than somebody with 0 political experience?

0 governing experience.

0 knowledge of politics or how things work.

Is that what you are saying? Because i disagree strongly. Both Pence and Ryan are eminently more qualified to be POTUS than Trump ever was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, im not butthurt, and you misinterpreted what i was asking.

No i didnt misinterpet anything.

I have conversations with republican/conservative friends who i know will immediately handwave the source since its website is "lawnwz

If ~~you are~~ "people" butt hurt over a website name nothing will change your mind.

 i was asking and being hopeful wed find another source more "trustworthy" with a better source that gives the same info.

What you are looking for is a website that appeals to the delicate sensitivities of conservatives on facebook.

To hell with that b.s. IMO

If people can't be bothered educate themselves about news sources than let them wallow in their ignornance. If a "Z" at the end of a URL suddenly invalidates the truthful, factual information contained within the article and the experience of the person who runs it then yeah dont waste your time, i wouldn't. 

This source when they report legal news is trustworthy. There is no reason to pussyfoot around calling them "trustworthy." That implies they are in fact not trustworthy which is false. 

If people can't handle a simple explainer that a source is wholly legitimate and experienced because of a letter in a URL than fuck that kind of ignornance or maybe not ignornance so much as it is stubbornness.

I think an example to illustrate differences could be:

Lawnewz is trustworthy

Shareblue is "trustworthy" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First things first, this is not fucking true.

and less than 24 hours later the entire democratic wing was calling for Attorney General Sessions to resign because he had the audacity to meet with the Russian Ambassador.

He is and was called to resign because **he lied about it**.

When asked multiple times, he denied it. People from the Transition denied.

If its a fucking meaningless meeting why would you lie about it? 

Why would you offer up in a congressional hearing that you had no contact when that wasn't even in question and you still offered up a lie.

**This is not about meeting the Russian Ambassador. This is about lying about it over and over and over for seemingly no good damn reason**

  Trump gave a very nice joint sessions of congress speech where he called on unity and putting aside petty partisan fights to pass improved healthcare and a 1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill.

When will Trump put aside petty partisan fights?

When will Trump stop making the judiciary into a partisan issue?


When will Trump apologize for the birther shit?

When will Trump apologzie for lies about Obama wiretapping him?

Why on earth does Trump or the Republicans who peddle his bullshit deserve to have democrats "put aside petty partisan fights" when they continue to propagate them both based in half-truths and full-lies?

I don't think anything was meant to distract anything from something that is going to very public, has been known to be happening for roughly a week now.

I don't really find it becoming that everytime Reddit gets stuck on a story that anything else that happens and controls a news cycle for a day or two is suddenly meant to distract you. 

Especially when it comes to the wiretapping lie and fact that the House Intel has no proof as per intel agencies or the fact that the Secretary of State publicly put preemptive military action on the table against North Korea, or the fact that the meeting between Merkel and Trump was supposedly tense and not hunky-dory.

Who pray tell is trying to distract everybody from this well known fact of what will be happening on Monday?

Certainly isn't the Trump Administration.  </TEXT>

Also. I know my personal experience is not rule of law but I have many conservative family andfriends who gag at the thought of Hillary. Wheb Bernie comes up the response is usually, I don't agree with him but at least hes honest.

Thats the important bit right there as to why many folks don't think Sanders could win.

Yes he's seemingly honest normal person but he is very liberal to a point where even if he has redeeming qualities as a human, the spending policies, the "big government", not conservative economically thing would greatly impact his chances, turning away or at least giving weariness to many conservative independent voters.

That is the most important factor i think that would contribute to his loss. Yes he's nice but he's the furthest thing from conservative and that's a breaking point for many voters especially when it's egged on by the Republican political machine.

People this election wanted change. Theyre tired of corrupt politicians. There tired of corporations owning their law makers. Trump offered real change.

What?

Trump didn't offer change. The only change is he wasn't a politician and just said whatever stuff was on his mind, no filter.

Outside of that, not very different than the archetypal corrupt politician.

Being tired of corrupt politicians and corporations owning law makers is one thing, totally fine. 

But than deciding the solution is a corrupt private citizen who is owned by corporations is not the solution.

Donald Trump offered change, that change being he will be corrupt, lie, cheat and steal out in the public with no shame.

I get that there are places in this country that are scared about the future of the economy, their jobs so on and so forth. I understand that but Donald Trump never offered change. He offered a safe umbrella for you to get under and hide from fairly inevitable things. Such as related to jobs, energy, etc. </TEXT>

 President Trump's administration asked Monday for more time to comply with a House Intelligence Committee request for evidence substantiating Trump's claim of wiretapping.
 
 But according to CNN, the Senate Intelligence panel has received a response to its inquiry into the presidents allegation.
 
 "I've talked to all the appropriate people," Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told CNN. He said he has received "sufficient" responses about the wiretapping claim.
 
 "I would say from our conversations, what we've gotten are sufficient answers, he added, though he would not confirm if there was evidence backing Trump's claim. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's entitled to it. I don't mind if it makes him look good but it sohuldn't have come to this.

It shouldn't have been leaked.

He should just release them, so if there is nothing to hide than just share them for the sake of transparency.

It's a perfectly reasonable request. If everything is in order than so be it.

I find it incredibly stupid to "shut down" arguments that don't exist in places, it's useless tactic and many times extremely condescending. Especially ones that are so very simply explained.

It's more useful to explain one to one to people when they propose an opinon based in incorrect facts or just on a world view that isn't fully understanding of a situation.

He's clearly lying. He can't look at Hayes and say no to a number of things.

I apologize for seemingly hijacking this thread making my comment which intially contained the below text. I won't delete because the information there is important but back to Carter Page.

The interview was horrendous, i will be excited to read professional opinions on Page's body language because it was bad. Looking away, smiling awkwardly. He rarely looked Hayes in the eyes when he denied doing things.


===================

Also, anybody else watching Maddow? She was leaked a confirmed DHS Intelligence document put together by State, ICE, DHS, USCIS and another that CITIZENSHIP IS NOT A GOOD DETERMINER FOR TERRORISM.

 She was interviewed by CNNs Jake Tapper after her visit in Syria and she uncovered some details that the CNN host did not like to hear. The Congresswoman disclosed strong evidence that Obama and his administration funded these two terrorist organizations.
 
 Gabbard said that Syrians expressed happiness and joy at seeing an American walking their streets. However, they also enquired as to why is it that the United States, its allies and other countries, are providing support, are providing arms, to terrorist groups like Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, who are on the ground there, raping, kidnapping, torturing, and killing the Syrian people?
 
 They asked me why is the United States supporting these terrorist groups who are destroying Syria  when it was Al-Qaeda who attacked the United States on 9/11, not Syria. I didnt have an answer for that.
 
 Tapper reacted by saying that, Obviously the United States government denies providing any sort of help to the terrorist groups you are talking about, they say they provide help for the rebel groups. </TEXT>

For somebody people who think will be some unstoppable force she isn't exactly putting herself out there in person. She's seemingly shut up after that trip to Syria sketchiness/controversy

Even a search on Youtube i see an interview with Tucker Carlson, an appearance on CNN and an interview on RussiaToday (RT)

Most if not all of them regarding Terrorism/Terrorists and her trip to Syria.


edit:

Thinking on it more, i don't think she is nessarily a bad politician but i admit that i am influenced by other supporters. I do get turned off by those in the "cult of personality", those who believe somebody is the savior or the 1 who can fix everything.

I'd like to think she is a good person and will be a good Rep for the people of Hawaii but personally looking to the future I couldn't give a shit if she ran. She a long fucking way to go before i ever even consider voting for her for anything.

Personally, somebody who I could support that has shown truely good colors since the election has been Al Franken. I have yet to see or hear that from Rep. Gabbard but i also understand she doesn't have the opportunity to grill Cabinet members like Franken has. 

A few written statements and little from her in person out in the mainstream consciousness just isn't good enough for me as a voter or a potential supporter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In case you dont read the article and just the headline it's worth noting that this was written by Rep John Conyers (D-MI)

Rep. John Conyers is ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and Rep. Jerrod Nadler is ranking member of the Judiciarys Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Subcommittee. 

Conyers was critical of Richard Nixon during his tenure, and as a result was number 13 on President Richard Nixon's enemies list during Nixon's 196974 presidential tenure. The president's Chief Counsel described him as "coming on fast," and that he was "emerging" as a "black anti-Nixon spokesman."

Conyers voted on the Articles of Impeachment against Nixon in July 1974. He is the last remaining member of the House Judiciary Committee who did so </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's also an unconstitutional requirement to be the president as the Constitution is very specific.

To be President but this is about to be a CANDIDATE for President. 

I think it would just be easier for the parties to insitute rules or rather states to do so </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There isn't a section on youtube called Black Crime. There's Trending, Subscriptions, Recommended, Movies.

There is no reason to not be 100% factual in this case. There is no reason to say "black crime" section when there is no section on Breitbart called that.

You don't need to mislead people into making Breitbart out to be bad, it's already fucking horrible so just use the facts.

	<TEXT> The move to appoint Bannon to such an important role goes directly against Trumps pledge to be a president to all Americans. Bannon has a long history of bigotry. Breitbarts publishing strategy made it the media arm of the racist Alternative-Right movement, **publishing articles promoting popular white nationalist tropes such as black on white crime** and that "rape culture" is inherent in Islam.  

Doesn't say black crime **section**

SPLC phrases it the better way than the way the Independent did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay?

Not Breitbart's website.

Mentions but not links to the black crime **section**

The site continues to devote a special section to Black Crime, but Gingrich, a member of Trumps transition team who may well be the next secretary of state, holds Bannon blameless: </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think a section is determined by the metadata keyword you apply to something. I think a section is where the content is posted and the metadata a searchable, sortable piece of metadata

 Still, who would use a "black crime" tag on stories?

Oh, racists.
