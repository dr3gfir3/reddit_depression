	<TEXT> It's hard to know exactly how many people couldn't tell or were influenced, but in a literal sense it destroyed constructive   informed discussion for months. If you're an average person that cares about an issue that other people don't know much about   you want to share what you know/read in your spare time, how do you compete with a disproportionate few who can bury your words, have hours to write misleading talking points, and can simulate a consensus that you're wrong?

At the very least, more informed discussion   debate is disrupted, hidden and/or reduced to propaganda. I don't think the outcome of this election has disproven this capability, and it will be tried and refined. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His show actually looks pretty structured to educate viewers on a variety of issues, the level of research that goes into each episode just doesn't sound like making comedy top priority.

As an independent, I was put off by how he ignored the details of the two email controversies (including how parties weed-out candidates   government officials dodge transparency attempts in-general, not unique to Clinton), ignored the DNC on-the-floor TPP and Clinton protests (instead saying it showed 'unity'), and did not pay any attention to the people either major party candidate was surrounding themselves with. Instead, he said pretty much what msm was saying at the time. The public needs to be better informed about politics and government transparency, not fed petty tabloid drama. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just don't fall in the trappings of party politics. Make sure you support individuals who really represent your interests. Pay attention to which people politicians associate with, their voting history, and who financially backs them (The Intercept usually does a good job at pointing this out). Your reaction to this is awesome and I hope more people will fight not just for a party, but for fundamental reform that the country desperately needs.

E.g., mass surveillance makes any reform efforts that go against powerful interests more difficult, money in politics gives reform efforts less representation, and other issues that affect your say in government regardless of what party you affiliate with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) is personally pushing agendas with both major party establishments.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

That's just one example, but for some reason people put a lot of faith in what presidential campaigners *say* as opposed to what they *do* and this is an example of the trap you'll fall into.

Neither major party candidate cared about you; one of them entirely expected you to vote for an extremely unpopular candidate (one who lost to Donald Trump of all people) after blocking an obviously popular candidate. By rewarding that, you're ensuring that such a practice never ceases to end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If that's been a problem for you before, I again highly reccomend The Intercept because they seriously do their research and provide primary source documents. I have the most confidence in them for investigative journalism.
The downside is that they publish articles less frequently than most.

I should add that certain sources are better for certain topics than others. A sign of a good journalist is one that has become a specialist in a topic and can tie current events into past events that the average person likely doesn't know about or forgot. E.g., I like Jim Sterling for games journalism because he frequently cites relevant past anticonsumer practices I may have forgotten or not known.

Also bias is inevitable. It isn't always a bad thing, like being biased against anti-consumer practices. As you become more informed on a topic (whether it's mass surveillance, us deep politics, etc) - you'll start to form your own views and question sources that you usually trust. 

That all said, I sources would recommend include:

1) TechDirt - tech/legal blog that talks about police militarization, anti consumer practices, surveillance, security. For deep politics, I think The Intercept is a better source.

2) Democracy Now! - a liberal news site that talks about issues that- and gives voices to people who- mainstream media largely ignores.

3) Dan Carlin's Common Sense Podcast - a guy who runs a very popular history podcast also has a long running political one. He offers thoughtful exploration on issues that tend to get ignored, ripe with interesting historical allusions (e.g., I learned Admiral Poindexter from the Iran Contra scandal   someone who lied to Congress under oath started the [first known mass surveillance program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office) after entering the private sector). He isn't really left or right, but more pro-constitution   anti-establishment. A lot of complaints heard in this election were things he's talked about for years. He takes a lot of time for each podcast episode, so they come out slowly.

4) Cory Doctorow is a really good source for topics like DRM and related security   consumer issues

5) Jupiter Broadcasting Unfilter podcast often does really good research (existing news articles) on current technology/political events, but one of the cohosts does cringingly spout vague uninformed conspiracy theories. The other guy cross references the articles while expressing reasonable skepticism on what mainstem media reports (also drawing from his technology background)

6) Bruce Schneier is a respected authority in the security field who is also against mass surveillance programs and the like. Offers interesting commentary on different security issues, but more optimistic about establishment politics imo.

7) Speakers at the Chaos Communications Congress can be very interesting and passionate. Jacob Appelbaum (originally from the Tor project   Wikileaks) has some of the best explanations for complicated technical surveillance programs that anyone can understand.

Hopefully this helps. </TEXT>

Starting with the Snowden revelations, they have consistently questioned power structures and mainstream media. Greenwald has been really reliable in that regard. I first saw it when mainstream media was ignoring the NSA revelations and tried to pin Snowden as a Russian spy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Intercept often focused on political appointments, deals, lobbyists, and other facets that we need more journalism covering. E.g.,

[Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) is personally pushing agendas with both major parties.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

That's just one example. If more people knew how both parties really operated, we'd all be better off. Instead endless stupidity and/or marketing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, it definitely did in a relative sense. Way more people were interested in the issue than ever before, e.g. the stories were constantly hitting the reddit front-page before mods started cracking down (leading to the eventual removal of this sub's mods). It's always going to be the case that the reformers are in the minority, especially when the fourth estate that is supposed to inform the public continuously does the opposite. Most of us saw msm's near complete disregard for the huge revelations, in contrast to the heroic journalism occurring at the same time.

In short, although I agree that there is a cultural aspect, I think most people are literally just uninformed; today information like this has to get through some pretty heavy filters before they reach most people.  </TEXT>

This year we've been hearing about incredibly ambitious FBI activities (much more than just encryption story), a Court saying NSA collected data is admissible evidence, local police departments abusing their data access, profitable surveillance businesses, rolling out facial recognition in security cameras, Microsoft selling software that can read emotions from individuals in a crowd, Microsoft selling software for police surveillance (see Domain Awareness System, NYC), global legislation   rulings that expand surveillance...

Not even to mention the usual improvements on privacy invasion from the private sector in 2016, e.g., Google's recent policy change, Microsoft Windows 10 data collection, WhatsApp, Facebook announcing tracking nonFacebook users..etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually trust the security team responsible for putting it out there. They've also been pressuring other companies like Symantec. This is their official reason for the 7 day notice:

Our standing recommendation is that companies should fix critical vulnerabilities within 60 days -- or, if a fix is not possible, they should notify the public about the risk and offer workarounds. We encourage researchers to publish their findings if reported issues will take longer to patch. Based on our experience, however, we believe that more urgent action -- within 7 days -- is appropriate for critical vulnerabilities under active exploitation. The reason for this special designation is that each day an actively exploited vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public and unpatched, more computers will be compromised.

Seven days is an aggressive timeline and may be too short for some vendors to update their products, but it **should be enough time to publish advice about possible mitigations, such as temporarily disabling a service, restricting access, or contacting the vendor for more information.** As a result, after 7 days have elapsed without a patch or advisory, we will support researchers making details available **so that users can take steps to protect themselves.** By holding ourselves to the same standard, we hope to improve both the state of web security and the coordination of vulnerability management.

Plus, wasn't it revealed in 2013 that Microsoft was sharing 0-days with the NSA? Wouldn't this be defeating that practice?

	<TEXT> Allegedly the original Skype team was exploring the interception capability as early as 2008 in a program called 'Project Chess.' They integrated their program with PRISM in 2010. They had the interception capability in their product before Microsoft even bought them. Microsoft then went on to patent it in 2011. However I remember Microsoft changed Skype even further for those purposes, which was controversial in the security community. I also heard China was intercepting Skype calls from older C3 talks (see the Tor talks on Youtube from around this time period), which cited scary stories of Chinese contacts. If so, Skype may have directly or indirectly harmed people living in autocratic regimes who rely on private communications.

There's actually an article that lists the timeline of events.

	<TEXT> What about issues that crop up only when you cannot refund it? And what if we become reliant on a good refund system that can be taken away, weakened or not extended to in-app purchases.

Journalism in-general is pretty bad right now, but those few who have proven their integrity (which isn't so much about neutrality but honesty, information depth, and sometimes risk) play a really important role. Good journalism can be an incredibly positive force. E.g., those who become specialists on a topic can frequently point out past events (either forgotten or not known to audience members) that illustrates a point or raises awareness about a reality (e.g., shady business practices, societal problems, etc).

I empathize with anyone who hates the utter debauchery going on, but I think we'll need good journalists (including game journalists, ie not corporate mouthpieces) even with the promise of refunds. Did I understand your point? What do you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alan Rusbridger (someone I think who earned his integrity) also talked about this scary situation. When I have time, I can go digging for it for anyone else interested. I heard him talk about it on YouTube as part of another related issue.

I'm sure a lot of us have become more aware of concerns of reliance on corporate controlled mediums for information exchange. Ranging from Comcast   AT T to Google/YouTube and Facebook. In-fact, Facebook has bragged in the past of their capability to give greater visibility to certain information   affect behavior (e.g., voting   mood study).

Edit: grammar </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worry about what astroturfing might do to the 'talking to real people' part. It's sad because it's a real shift in tone from people talking about issues they care about in their spare time, to people whose job it is to push some kind of product or agenda.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't speak for me, I actually don't mind if some comments reference certain relevant subreddits, especially if they're linking an aggregated list of sources located on that subreddit. /r/undelete gets mentioned whenever popular posts get removed, and that subreddit made a tangible difference to /r/technology.

Moreover, aren't there issues that are more worth getting upset over than this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you read the portion that requested avoiding using AT T collected data in court? You didn't even mention the sizable concern of parallel construction.

Hemisphere isnt a partnership but rather a product AT T developed, marketed, and sold at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers. No warrant is required to make use of the companys massive trove of data, according to AT T documents, only a promise from law enforcement to not disclose Hemisphere if an investigation using it becomes public.

Considering AT T's well known history (including exclusive involvement in FAIRVIEW which collected much more than metadata), it isn't surprising to hear these allegations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Parallel construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction) rears its ugly head again:

"Once AT T provides a lead through Hemisphere, then investigators use routine police work, like getting a court order for a wiretap or following a suspect around, to provide the same evidence for the purpose of prosecution. This is known as parallel construction."

This document here is striking, Schwartz told The Daily Beast. Ive seen documents produced by the government regarding Hemisphere, but this is the **first time Ive seen an AT T document which requires parallel construction in a service to government.** Its very troubling and not the way law enforcement should work in this country." </TEXT>
