	<TEXT> When I'm eating at a restaurant, I always eat my side before the main dish. I can't eat my burger until all of my fries are gone. Which usually results in me taking home my burger because I'm full from my fries.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stole a piece of dubble bubble gum when I was 7 because my grandma wouldn't buy me any at the store. My mom found out that I took it and made me walk back to the store, ask for the manager, and explain to him that I had stolen this piece of gum. The manager gave me a ziploc bag and some gloves and made me clean up trash outside. Embarrassing but I've never taken anything since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In grade 9 I was having a lot of mental health issues and ended up missing about 2 weeks of school for a suicide attempt. This was close to finals, and my English teacher drove 35 minutes to my city (I went to school out of town) to drop off my study guides for all of my classes, as well as giving me her personal cell number if I ever needed to talk. She saved my life on more than one occasion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was about 5 I was at this restaurant with my parents and her friend, and I suddenly had a craving for gum. Luckily for me, the underside of the table was overflowing with delicious pieces for my grubby 5 year old hands to choose from. When we got home, my mom asked me where I got the gum from, and I lied and told her that I got it from her friend. Her friend had dentures so obviously she wasn't chewing gum. My mom asked me again and I told her that I found it under the table, cue me being forced to brush my teeth for half an hour. Good times. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Child's Play 3. I was seven years old and I watched the entire movie through the space between my fingers because I was covering my face. I had nightmares for almost ten years over that stupid movie.

On the bright side, I rewatched it when I was 18 and almost fell asleep because it was so boring. So there's that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Customers arguing about things they're obviously wrong about. I worked at a grocery store and I had one old lady yell at me while I was scanning her items because the peanut butter was coming up as the wrong price. I went and checked the price and it turns out it was the smaller jars that were on sale and she had grabbed one of the big ones. When I walked back to the till to tell her, she accused me of changing the sign and asked for a manager, who ended up giving it to her for the sale price because she wouldn't take no for an answer. </TEXT>
