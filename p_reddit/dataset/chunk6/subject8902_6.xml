	<TEXT> We've been under staffed in the automotive center a while, and associates have been complaining. A few techs have went to management and were told to if they weren't happy with the way things were to suck it up or quit. 

I'm the sporting goods manager, but I was a tech, so I'm one of the few people in the store actually certified, and I'm always getting pulled out there to help due to the staffing issues. When this happens it makes it where I can't get my own tasks done and management always have things to say about that. 

It came to a head the other day when one of the techs quit, and now I was forced to change my schedule and come in Sunday to work out there literally all day, from 8-6, the entire time our automotive center is open. And there's only 2 of us out there all day, so it will screw us when we have to take lunches. 

Does this kind of shit happen at other stores? </TEXT>
