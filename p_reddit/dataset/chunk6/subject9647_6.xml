	<TEXT> After a lift, I always get anxious anytime I see a cop or a cop car...which is terrible because where I live, cops are allowed to take their squad cars home with them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ulta is much easier to me. Sephora inside of JC Penney is easier than a standalone store...I've hit the JC Penney one 3 times with not a single problem, but on my second trip to a standalone store near me I got caught. Probably because I got greedy, but oh well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend and I just moved into our first apartment, which sadly exhausted all of our money except for $8.00, but we needed groceries to eat fresh, healthy stuff since I've been extremely sick lately and we've been living off of the dollar menu at McDonald's. We needed to get some Gatorade since I've been puking and dehydrated, so I offered to run to the store...I lifted a 6 pack of Gatorade and some frozen meals, some pasta, fresh fruit,  potato chips, and a gallon of milk. I filled a cart and just pushed it out...told my boyfriend that everything was on sale  I love Publix. </TEXT>
