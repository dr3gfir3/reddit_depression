	<TEXT> I had frog legs once.      
I didn't like them - it was like an odd mixture of chicken and fish, as if it couldn't decide which one it was. Like that meat in the school lunch, or airplane food.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quite simply!     
    
"You know, I've been meaning to tell you, I think we have a good thing going and wonder if you'd like to take it to the next level."    
"What do you mean? You mean like...?"    
"Yeah, I was wondering if you'd mind being my girlfriend / boyfriend."    
    
To which they go...   
    
"Oh, well, I'd really just rather keep things they way they are."    
or    
"You know, I was wondering when you were gonna ask me."     
     
That sort of thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Admittedly keto seems pretty counter-intuitive. It almost goes against everything you've been taught about dieting your whole life. But it's amazing how well it works if you can keep it up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You put yourself in the friend zone the moment you make the person believe you're anything besides a romantic interest. How do you get out? You tell them that you are interested. If they're interested too, then great. You have a date. If they're not, you move on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard ones like, "don't skip a meal or your body will go into starvation mode and save every calorie." Lots of diet-pseudo-advice floated around high school.   
My parents were also from the pre-refrigeration era, so raw *anything* was sure to kill you.     
And oh yes, chilly weather was sure to get you sick. Because you know, colds come from the cold, and not, you know, germs.    
   
I hope you can read my sarcasm and disdain for the above ninny bits I wrote there. </TEXT>

An old soul in a young body who still has a lot to learn, and thankful that - health be willing and luck be kind - I may actually get a chance to learn some of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to categorise uncategorised pages and help with copy-editing and spelling  / grammatical mistakes. I also used to translate pages from German or Japanese (when the new English pages had much less information than the original German or Japanese pages). But then the bots started attacking what I did because all the "citations" were in the original language, and reversions started happening. I gave up after that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Love it. Especially when I met my soul mate. Until then, it was just somewhere between a fun activity and a chore (depending how I felt at the time). But then, I met that one man that spun my world around, and now it's all I want to do. </TEXT>
