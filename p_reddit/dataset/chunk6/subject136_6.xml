	<TEXT> I love pain usually. Anything serves. Now that I don't cut I find a lot of other types of pain even more satisfying it seems. Pulling my hair and burning are other types of self injury I've engaged in.

I have an addictive personality so usually I can get my fix from other things (alcohol, setting fire, puking, starving myself, etc.) but most of it is self destructive and thus I attempt to avoid it all. </TEXT>
