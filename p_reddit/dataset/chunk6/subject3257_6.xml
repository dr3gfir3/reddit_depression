	<TEXT> Walt seems to be more skilled in survival than you suggest. He isn't as good as Gus in ways, but in others aside from just chemistry he's better.

He has been lucky, but really his skills and intellect have done more for him than luck by this point.

I mean, he killed Gus. Gus was a genius who knew the game inside and out, and Walt still tricked him. I know killing one man isn't everything but still that event was in no way luck </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the first episode where I can really feel like everyone's lost it.

Obviously Walt and Jesse did long ago. And I knew everyone else was different than they were from the start, but this feels to me like the first time we've seen how far gone Skyler, Hank, Marie, and even Jr to a lesser extent.

I never liked Hank but after his comment "good" about Jesse... Fuck him. I know Walt is going down, but I hope he wins his fight with Hank first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Word, maybe I misunderstood. I got the impression you were implying a significant amount of people are held back by addiction. Some are and all, but it's really very  very few. I think so far I only know one person who I would say is held down by addiction like that.. and I don't think he's actually.homeless anymore but living in horrible conditions that really aren't any better. But shit, a lot of "homes" are worse than the streets in some places.

It's cool you hook people in need up though, because that helps them the most sometimes. It's not the money, just the thought for some people. I try to do it myself but sometimes going check to check you don't have it yourself.

And I am fine when people buy alcohol or cigs or other drugs instead of food or putting it into a savings account. Because when you're homeless, food is worth a lot to you, but you'll usually find it. You'll eventually know what food places to hit up when they close or where to go for a free meal. And a lot of people buy food give food away. But it's just food and you eat it and then you're still in the same place. You feel the same as before. With alcohol for example though, it gives you a sort of break sometimes. It can seriously be the only break of relaxation someone has in their entire life. Sometimes I would rather give someone time to just chill out instead of food because it's still important.
