Trading away Terrance West.. Receiving Knowshon Moreno

My other RBs are:

C.J. Spiller
Ahmad Bradshaw
Toby Gerhert
Pierre Thomas
alfred Blue


With Crowell emerging even if Tate is out again will West be worth the spot? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah you'll be hurting at WR. Patterson has fell off the fantasy radar without AP. I'd look at grabbing a WR off waivers today as a result of this trade. Malcolm Floyd, Jordan Matthews, Brian quick, and either Allen hurns or Allen Robinson are some names that should be available in most leagues. The good thing is that WR is the easiest position to replace :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A guy I know has a "3d wood printer"  I think he calls it a see and see machine? Well anyway I asked him to make thors hammer as our trophy this year... So far it looks awesome..

Edit. Everyone asking about a price I'll have to ask this guy and get back to you. I'm not sure he intends to sell anything.

I'll be doing a follow up post with completed hammer pics </TEXT>
