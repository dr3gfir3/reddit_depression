	<TEXT> Well, welcome to /r/atheism ;) 

We discuss the harm caused by religion pretty often here.  
You can only say so much about there being insufficient evidence to believe in gods.

The main features of the 'new' atheism are that it is agnostic, and anti-theistic.

Edit: also the writer of the article is a Muslim, so its not as simple as to be an anti-Muslim post. He is calling for different standards among Muslims than that which give this professor a platform.

	<TEXT> We joined the common market in 1973, and the UK is on course to leave it.  That might affect the movement of goods and services over the Gibraltar border. Gibraltar is totally reliant on food imports, which are likely to become more expensive.

The Maastrict Treaty with the right to free movement of people came into affect in 1993 as you say. However the situation post-Brexit might not be identical to the situation pre-1993. Theresa May has indicated that stopping free movement is essential for her and the EU has indicated that they see the UK and Gibraltar borders as the same.

There is lots of concern about it in the Gibraltan media if you care to google it.
The [Gibraltan Chief Minister thinks it's a problem.](http://www.satprnews.com/2017/02/02/gibraltar-urges-meps-to-work-towards-sensible-brexit/)

So you can't just hand-wave the issue away. Some special deal needs to be made.

It is quite possible that the UK will lose its relationship with Gibraltar over Brexit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Christianity is more about personal revelation than is Islam, which seems more about societal rules, though there is quite a bit of overlap of course.

Most Christians are not bothered at all for example, that if you take all the verses about the crucifixion and the resurrection from all four gospels, and try to put them in a logical order, that there is basically no way you can do it. Some of the gospels *must* be untrue.

I did post a link about Koranic variations elsewhere in the thread though. It looks to me as though there are quite a few, but that its a taboo subject and not addressed by Islamic scholars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I have written about this elsewhere in the thread. My view is that there is nothing special about old Arabic compared to any other language. Try translating William Shakespeare into Japanese.

There are always problems with translation between languages, the actual definitional meaning of any sentence can almost always be replicated, with careful choice of words, and additional qualifications. The rhythm, rhyme and style is more problematic.

But in a nutshell, if you can learn the language of the Koran, you can also translate it. That's what you are doing in your own head when you read it.

Have you got any particular examples of untranslatable parts of the Koran in mind? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. Bart Ehrman is always a good read about this stuff I find. In the case of the Koran I think it does have an advantage over the Gospels, in that it was written during Mohammed's life, rather than 40-200 years later.

Having said that I don't believe in gods so the age and authorship of these books is of academic rather than practical interest to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually quite a few religions have 'unmodified' texts. Judaism has the Torah in Hebrew, The Mormons have the (admittedly transparent fake) Book of Mormon in English. Scientology texts are in English.

The New Testament is an exception. We have Greek and Latin versions, and some Hebrew I think, but the original Aramaic of Jesus was oral and is lost.

I think if you go digging then there are problems with the transcriptions of the Koran and Haddiths too, but there isn't much scholarly criticism of the sceptical variety as with the Bible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's arguable that words always have slightly different nuances between people even if they are in the same language. 

What does the Koran contain? I believe it has observations about life, instructions on how to live and historic stories? I don't think there is anything among those that can't be rendered in a different language, aside from rhythm and style? Poetic or literary style can have a more  difficult nuance.

Do you have a specific part in mind?      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In some ways I find it refreshing compared to Christian apologists, who often say that the words in the bible mean other things in their original languages.

At least the Koran in Arabic is pretty much the same as the original. The Hadiths on the other hand are potentially very different from the original statements.

Edit: [oh there is a pretty big list of potential Koranic variations here.](http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Text/) But I am no expert. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  At least then it'll be your interpretation, not some other person's

That can be a bad thing with historical texts. A good translation will be done by an expert, or a group of experts.

It's also in the Islamic laws that you can't read the Qur'an in a different language (they are considered interpretations not the actual Qur'an) and you need to read it in Arabic to avoid a chain of interpretations changing the overall meaning

Yes I understand. However I am sceptical that there is anything special about the Koran in this regard. All complex or historical texts will pose challenges to a translator, in presenting every nuance in the new version. Its not impossible though, translation is a sophisticated craft.

Just to pick something completely at random, consider the poem [*Faint Heart on a Railway Train*](http://everything2.com/title/Faintheart+in+a+Railway+Train) by Thomas Hardy. In English, the first stanza can be read in a rhythm like the sound of a train. In the second stanza this breaks down and becomes much more fluid. This possibly represents the break in the routine of the character in the narrative. To translate this into Arabic, or any sufficiently different language, I  think this rhythmic nuance will be hard to carry over. There is a great deal of symbolism in it too, which will present other problems.

Edit: I added a part about Koranic exceptionalism, but its getting off-point so I have taken it out again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 'whatever he can afford' is quite a hefty charge if it doesn't have a limit.

There are many thousands of churches around the world, RC, COE, and COS are only three of them (albeit with most of the members in the UK),

Edit: I was just googling about the Church of Scotland's policy, [and found this pdf](http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/2371/stewardship_2004report.pdf). They seem to consider tithing to be 10% by definition, and the question is whether to recommend tithing, or recommend something else. In any case, they aim to collect money from their congregations.

I think in summary, that most churches are keen to side-step the ugly business of having a published price, but they want 10%. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [The word tithe literally means 10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe) so if I were a pedant I might argue that all tithes are 10% by definition.

However of course people do make donations to churches of other amounts. Nearly All churches whose policy I know allow lower amounts for those who can't afford them. However all Christians I have discussed this with either pay 10% or aspire to pay 10%

The CoE General Synod promotes an amount of 5%, though the [Archbishop of the time argued for 10%,](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the-church-of-englands-general-synod-carey-suggests-10-tithe-from-rich-anglicans-1533072.html) again from those who can afford it. 5% is still a rather significant sum, so my I stand by my point even in that case.

As discussed elsewhere the CoE makes hundreds of millions from its other business activities so evidently doesn't need to charge its customers directly. 

The Roman Catholic Church seems at pains to say that no fixed amount is required, but that an amount is required. I haven't found a webpage in which they state their policy which doesn't mention 10%, while saying that isn't mandatory.

The mormons  mandate 10%.

I'd be interested to know what churches you are thinking of, as 10% does seem typical among smaller churches in London. The figure of 10% seems to come from Genesis 28:22. I don't think there is a scriptural basis for any other percentage, though as I said, its common for churches to at least claim that lower amounts are acceptable for those with low incomes. (though as the tithe is proportional anyway, I don't really see the logic of this)

	<TEXT> nobody seems to appreciate that most of these organisations are following the law.

I realism that, but I think the law should be changed, to stop commercial  activities of religions from being tax-exempt.

So the logical conclusion is that people want to single out the religious non-profits and tell them to pay more than any other type of non-profit, for what reason apart from discrimination?

Yes that's basically it. Religion is harmful in ways that secular non-profit charitable work is not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, perhaps I wasn't clear. I was talking about natural selection. 

When a living thing reproduces, there are variations in the features of the offspring.  None of these features or variations have any purpose. They are not developed in order to do anything. They are essentially random changes in the genes as they are copied. Most of the variations are neutral or actually harmful to the offspring's chances of reproducing. A smaller proportion of variations however happen to be beneficial for reproduction, and so over time the population will tend to develop those features. 

Evolution by natural selection does not plan ahead in any way. None of the features have purpose.        

Just because a thing is useful in some way is not the same as that being the thing's purpose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. I think the way I'd proceed would be to ask the affected woman where she was resident at the time it happened, and who was responsible.

She can remain silent, or lie, but I think she should be discouraged from that.

When we have the identity of an adult who was complicit in it, the police should arrest them, put them in an interview room, shine a light in their face and play 'nice cop/nasty cop' with them until they confess, or 24 hours passes. At a minimum that would be uncomfortable for them and word would get around.

If they have any children in their household at that point, they should be taken into care.

Additionally, I wonder if any legal action could be taken against victims who don't reveal who was responsible? That might seem unsympathetic, but don't forget they are in fact to some extent complicit themselves, in that case. </TEXT>

You say that and yet you immediately qualify it with 'intentionally'.

Now is it, and should it be shining lasers at aircraft which is crime, or intentionally doing so? It seems from the article that they are changing it from the latter, to the former.

Its a bad approach, to make very broad laws then enforce them selectively.

It seems to me that if a person shines a laser at a plane, but there is reasonable doubt about their intentions, then they shouldn't be convicted of trying to dazzle the pilot. </TEXT>

I am not sure that there is in general something stopping that in the current system, though you were in a case when the more persuasive members felt that should not happen. What ensures that will usually be the case?

In my idea, the jurors would have a summing-up from the judge, as they do now. He or she should be able to direct on what to consider and what not to consider.

The 'sweet spot' would be selected at such a point to allow for the statistical fact that a certain proportion of jurors do not act reasonably. (whatever proportion that is). </TEXT>
