Kendrick, dont! Edgar radioed.

I wont let them do this, Kendrick growled back.

You cant fight them all yourself! Well track them. Look for an opportunity!

No. Theyre too good. Theyll get away.

Cant you see? They stuck a tracker on you! Thats why they let you go! Thats how they found us! *Theyve been asking about Clint all along!*

He ignored Edgars continued shouting and moved into the dust cloud behind the kidnappers. On a sudden suspicion, he angled left. A small explosion boomed to his right, where someone had thrown down a grenade of some sort. He dodged two more in the dust cloud, and then, veering right among them, he kicked out.

The last Grey Rider in the squad flipped over rapidly, crashing to the ground.

A punch sent the next sprawling.

Ahead, he could see Clint, surrounded by twelve men. The Grey Leader rode at the front, now looking back and giving orders.

Twelve pistols opened up fire on him. The impacts felt like brutal rain on his bulletproof vest, and would likely have downed a man less enraged and less insane from exhaustion. Some bullets bounced from his helmet, and some ripped skin away from his biomechanical arms. He weaved only to protect his bike.

His unstoppable approach struck surprise and fear into the twelve, emotions which only grew as he came upon the first with a roar and a sweep of his arm that threw the man clean off his bike. The machine tumbled and bounced separately from its owner. Another man fell, his bike kicked out from underneath, and the remaining ten soldiers began shooting lower.

Feeling his bike take hits, Kendrick veered, knocking two over bodily, his rage-fueled heart filled with hope that he might actually succeed. The Grey Riders began adapting to his tactics, staying out of range while they reloaded awkwardly on their speeding cycles. The whipping dust and wind made everything even more complexthey didnt notice as Edgar came up behind them and began shooting tires.

Several men fell away. Only a few remained; one still held Clint on a forward course.

Ahead, the Grey Leader made a move of his own. He lifted his gun and radioed: **Stop.**

Never! Kendrick shouted back.

But the Grey Leader didnt shoot at him. The next bullet went toward Edgar, who fell abruptly and tumbled like a rag doll in the dirt. The gun turned toward Clint.

You bastard! Kendrick screamed, spending the last of his turbo to come up on the Leader. You wouldnt!

**Correct,** the Leader responded. He lowered his gun and took something else outa tazer. Now that Kendrick was close enough, it could reach.

Seeing hed been outplayed, Kendrick roared, *Youll regret this!*

The Grey Leader nodded. **Yes. I know.**

The electricity tore through his wounded and exhausted body with a force that blacked him out nearly instantly.

He floated in pained darkness for a time.

That was it. Hed failed.

Anger burned somewhere, dissipating the darkness.

He awoke on the ground. Somewhere, he could hear his squad shouting. Opening his eyes, he stumbled to his feet and made his way back.

Mona was leaning over Edgar and crying. What what was this?

Randys face was bloodied, her nose broken.

Clint was long gone, abducted by the Grey Riders for unknown reasons.

Carmen was trapped in a hell world.

He himself was a burned and mutilated monster of a former human being.

And Edgar was dead.

He fell to his knees, brutalized in every way imaginable.

And where was Lian? He couldnt recall seeing her since the Grey Rider ambush. Was she simply gone? Fled?

Cheng, Mona, Randy, Pixley. Jesus. There was only five of them left. Theyd almost been reunited. The family had almost had a reunion. The band had almost gotten back together.

And now they were scattered, wounded, captured, deadbecause of his anger. His refusal to stop.

What do we *do?* Randy asked, her hand on Monas back for support, tears running down her face.

Kendrick just shook his head.

Cheng stood alone, staring at Edgars body.

Pixley said quietly, Lets go back. Join the others.

No! Randy shouted at her. Not like this. She lowered her head. When I was in Her Glorys system, I saw a chokepoint world. Everyone who moves through this region will have to go through there to get out. We should go there. This place is death. We cant stay here. We need to go there and wait for allies. Kendrick?

He just shook his head again. How could he give orders after seeing the disasters hed caused?

Somewhere along the chase, Clints journal had fallen onto the ground, and Randy had picked it up. They thought to open it, perhaps see the truth of the tortured mans past, but that seemed petty now. They buried the journal in that bleak ground and left it for all time, forgiving him.

There was no longer any happy discussion. There was no longer morale of any sort. Picking up what they had left, riding until empty, and then walking the rest of the way through the last of Her Glorys fading violet portals, they reached the reality Randy had told them about, at last, through a natural rift. Out of supplies, out of fuel, out of spirit, they stopped and looked up.

A vast white wall split the skynot just the sky, but the universe itself.

Its a change in vacuum instability, made visible by the particular physics here, Randy explained. In two years, this Earth will be destroyed by that approaching wall. Literally nothing can survive it.

Why did you bring us here? Pixley asked, tired.

Think about it, she said, expressing the first hope in two days. No threats are going to come here from the multiverse. Would you go to a planet thats about to be destroyed?

Cheng nodded, understanding. So its safe. And everyone who passes through Her Glorys domain will have to come this way.

Mona sat, still in a grieving daze. And anyone who doesnt make it here in the next two years never will.

Wordlessly, Kendrick stalked off into the forest. He returned with a pile of brush, sat down, and made a fire. It was like every other fire they had made, but this one was colored by sorrow, losses, and home. Then we wait, he said, staring at the fire. For people, for resources, for opportunities. Somehow, well save Carmen and Clint, and maybe Lian will find us. Someday, Bill too, if what Clint said was right.

His squadmates joined him at the fire. None were untouched by loss and pain. None spoke that entire night. In those hours, his hopes seemed a tall order, but there was nothing else left to do. Hope was not their choice, but it had been thrust upon them nonetheless. Blessed sleep came, ending the Week of Hell, and marking the end of their journey as they knew it. None stood watch, for not even existence itself was cruel enough to hit them yet again.

It was the first fire of the famed Waystation of the Retreat Front, and it would become far bigger than its unwitting creators. They awoke in the afternoon to the sight of scattered refugees heading across the low valley beneath their camp. They had seen the fire's smoke, and were seeking safety. They were the first of many. </TEXT>

Shaking against the sheer force of exhaustion on his mind, Kendrick nearly barreled right into the final portal. In the state it was in, he actually missed it as it flickered out of existence, and he tumbled on the flat dirt beyondsaved from greater injury by his helmet.

He climbed to his feet and stumbled back to the others, who stood around the portal with their helmets off and their eyes wary. Beyond lay the insane geometries that Monas initial study had warned of. Waterfalls of acid flowed up into the air, angled right, curved left, circled back down, and more; the world beyond looked like an endless mass of twisting emerald liquid strings tied up into a knotted ball. Among those knots floated islands of volcanic rock, each hosting flocks of strange spiked birds. This place seemed akin to Yngtak, where gravity and earth were random and scattered, but there was no crystalline beauty or effervescent sunlight here. This was a place of fire, acid, and death, and Carmen had already been stranded within for six days.

How long do we have? Kendrick asked.

A few hours, a day, Edgar said, shaking his head to stay awake. From what I remember.

Alright. Lets make a plan to tackle this. How far in is she, Clint?

Clint pointed. No special abilities were needed.

A small firewood, not volcanicburned on the second floating mountain from the portal. Were they in range?

Carmen! Cheng radioed on his handheld. Are you there?

If she can make a fire, shes found wood, so there must be organics, Mona thought aloud while they waited. Food and water.

The response came with such powerful relief that some clasped their hands to their chests. Cheng?! Is that you?

It was Carmens voice, and she was alive.

Pixley stared. How do we get up there? How do we get her?

Edgar bent down and began scribbling distances and calculations in his journal.

Carmens voice came again. My love, theres no way out of here. I dont want you risking your life for me.

I have to, he shot back. Its you and our child. I cant leave you here.

Verenes here, and two others. Weve been eating the birds, and drinking their blood for water. Its not the ideal diet, but were not going to die today. Ive thought a lot about this. I want you to come back when youve got a safe way to retrieve us. A helicopter would do it. I refuse to lose you, and I wont let anything happen to our child.

Kendrick cut in. Carmen

Kendrick! Youre alive, too! My God, I thought youd burned to death.

Itll take more than that, he said with a grin. But we cant come back later. These portals only have a day left on them. If we dont rescue you now, we never will.

Edgar frowned. Statements like that were always bad luck. In fact

Even as they watched, the portal flickered violentlyand began to shrink with a noise akin to tearing paper. Several screams and shouts rang out.

Edgar reacted with the information at hand, sending over the radio, Its closing *now!*

Cheng ran for the portal and dove forward, but the edges caught his waist, and he began to scream. Instinctively, Kendrick jumped and caught the edges of the portal with his bare hands.

Ive heard of this once before, Edgar shouted. Itll work! Help him!

All hands joined at the edge of flickering violet energy. The squad pulled with all their might, many screaming from the electrical pain in their hands. A strange sound of straining metal emanated from Kendricks shoulders, and the portal began to widen ever so slightly.

Cheng began crawling forward.

Dont, Carmen said, speaking over the radio. I can see what youre doing, my love. Im watching with binoculars. Nows not the time. Youll be trapped over there, and starve. Please go back.

Cheng shouted refusal, but Carmen insisted. The pained screaming of his squadmates prompted him to action, and he slowly pushed his way back out. They let go with relief, the portal snapped shut, and he fell backwards onto the bleak earth, tears streaming down his face.

Randy and Pixley went to him while the others stood dumbfounded.

After all that, theyd failed, and Carmen was gone.

There must be something we can do Edgar breathed.

Kendrick stared at his reddened hands. We were so close.

Mona thought to tell them what had happened when she had more or less prayed for help in that biomechanical towerbut the cost had been too high and the result too unclear, and she didnt trust their shared emotional and mental state to make smart decisions.

Lian stood quietly, her hands folded. Even she knew when not to speak.

Clint fell on his butt, drained in more ways than one.

We were gonna be all together again, Kendrick said in a daze. We were gonna sit around the fire and argue about Molly Ringwald. With Bills death, I thought wed never be the same, but on this ride

Edgar clasped his shoulder. Well find a way. We live in insane times. Well find a portal or something.

Bills death? Clint asked, confused. Bills not dead. Hes just very far away. I didnt put him on our map because I thought you

Edgar and Kendrick both turned and stared, eyes wide. Edgars expression was far more terrified than his friends. In that instant, he had just begun to comprehend the shape of something very large and very alarming. What did you say?

A gunshot rang out. Turning, they saw Jennifer Pixley turning to shoot another oncoming enemy. Several more were running at her, and she leapt to deliver a kick to one's throat and a punch to anothers gut in quick succession. Cheng was quick to his feet, joining her with his pistol. Randy moved more slowly and took a punch to her nose, which splattered blood on the dirt as she fell.

The attackers had come from over a hill, and with the intent of surprising them, but these men in grey uniforms and black helmets had guns, too. Why werent they using them? The ones shot by Pixley writhed, but their body armor had taken the brunt.

Horrified, but not wanting to escalate the conflict, Kendrick shouted, *No guns!*

Despite the surprise, the squad understood the reason, and Edgar, Kendrick, and Mona raced forward to push the enemies away from their friends. A dozen or more grey-clad men surged around them, dancing away only from Kendricks deadly punches, until a shout rang out from behind.

Another group had come from behind to seize Clint. Theyd been played!

The men shoved Clint onto a bike, tied his hands to the bars, put a gun on him, and took off at high speed with him in the middle.

Among them, the Grey Leader hung back for just a moment and gave Kendrick a direct stare for a long moment, as if warning him that following them would result in more lethal force. As quickly as they had come, the still-mounted Grey Riders disappeared in both directions.

The two Pixley had shot had been left behind. Both still lay on the ground in pain.

With a roar of anger, Kendrick pulled at ones clothes, forced the man out of his bullet-proof vest, put it on himself, ran to his own bike, kicked off, and sped after the enemy.

Shouting to the others, Edgar said, Everyone else stay back! Ill get Kendrick. He cant take them all on by himself!

Pushing his scant turbo fuel to the limits, Kendrick caught sight of the enemys position ahead. The chilly wind whipped their dust up in a curtain, hiding him from their sight; so, too, were they hidden from him. They were riding at top speed as well. There was no opportunity for maneuvers. He simply rode as fast as he could, ignoring the rumbling and potential of falls on the slightly uneven terrain. The gap shrank.

What the hell is this? Kendrick demanded furiously. This isnt what we were sent out here to do! He looked to Randy, who nodded with understanding.

Jen?

Randy tried again on another frequency. Jen?

It took three more tries before the surprised response came. Randy?!

Yeah, its me, she said quietly. Care to explain whats going on?

Were doing what must be done, Pixley said, defensive. You should band with us, and fight back against the Grey Riders. The human race needs food.

Theyre human, too, Randy countered, her tone angry. And this is not the way. Were not going to band with *this*, and you have a loyalty to us first. To me.

I do. I miss you. But this is about food, about home, about rebuilding. And theyre vulnerable right now, with their forces out in the war. Do you know where this is? We found some clues they missed. This is Amber One.

Edgar sat taller on his bike, electrified.

Randy shook her head. Carmen needs your help. The woman, the baby under your carethey need you. You cant imagine the world shes stranded in right now. Its going to take all of us to rescue her.

No further response came.

As the squad watched, someone managed to get a grenade inside the tank down the street, and the operators climbed out and jumpedonly to be shot where they fell. The tank ruptured from within, and lay silent and smoking.

Randy stepped out and stood, helmet off, her red hair certainly visible from that distance.

One rider near the tank stopped. The others moved on to the next conflict, sending out small groups to find food depots. Randy stared down the remaining rider.

More gunfire echoed from somewhere, and the lone rider rolled toward her, head low. The bike stopped a few feet away, and its owner stepped off and removed her helmet.

Jennifer Pixley matched her angry gaze with one of embarrassed determination. I wont apologize or explain myself.

Youve got a lot of hate inside you, dont you? Randy asked. People in your life that were very close to you betrayed you and damaged you.

Smoke drifted across the scorched street. What of it?

Well never do that to you. Never.

Pixley looked away for a moment. Ill help get Carmen. But then you need to join up with the uniting Vanguard and refugees. This is our best shot at rebuilding. We have to work together. If you dont like how we operate, change it from the inside.

Randy looked to the side, where the others remained hidden around the corner. Kendrick nodded.

Alright.

And then they were hugging, all of them in turn. At realizing the others had heard their conversation, Pixley seemed embarrassed, but nobody brought up her exposed terrible inner pain. As Randy had said, none of them would ever hurt her if they could help it.

She came to Clint, and paused.

The two shared a standoff glare.

He reached out a hand.

She shook it.

None in the squad would ever find out what had transpired between them, and no record exists of why they shook hands and truced.

The squad made ready to ride on from that place of cannibalism and darkness. Jennifer paused at the portal to radio her allies so that they would not expend resources looking for her. Ill be back. Theres something I gotta do.

Beside her, the portal flickered off for several seconds, and she briefly thought it might not return. When it reappeared, she quickly rode through.

Nearly completely reunited, the squads morale rose, despite the ominous fading of the portals, the increasing reoccurrence of gas lights and fuel trading, and the intense weight of sleeplessness on the bulk of their members.

Riding down along the shore of a wide river of glowing white liquid, Kendrick wavered on his bike and nearly fell; he hallucinated Carmen grabbing his handlebars and holding him up, but she wasnt there. He adjusted instinctively and managed to remain riding. The stimulants kept him from falling asleep, but his perceptions and reaction time were becoming increasingly flawed.

Talking, laughing, and trading stories of where theyd been, the squad did everything they could to keep their minds occupied. This was the longest section of the journey, and their destination was horrifically deadly. Happy conversations shielded them from thoughts of what lay ahead, and of what was already happening to them. Low fuel, mental states degrading, and the fractures healingwhy think of any of this? There was nothing they could do.

There is a theory that, if a great number of people hope for something, reality may alter to make it possible. The first supposed example of this was the Apollo 13 mission in the twentieth century; three astronauts who should never have made it home instead *did* make it home thanks to the collective will of the entire world watching, made possible by the recent advent of television and global communication.

Perhaps all sentient beings have some infinitesimal sliver of reality-bending capability, a barest fraction of what someone like Gisela the Yellow possessed. Perhaps all sentient beings affect existence in an interactive manner. Perhaps, all together, the combined will of billions can create opportunity where none should have existed.

The Week of Hell was not a nickname simply applied at random. Unbeknownst to Kendrick, their brief stop and conversation at the Zkirax insect realitycombined with the squads removal of their lurking Monstersparked a rumor and a story. With so many billions wandering the region on foot and vehicle, with so many radios and conflicts ongoing, the story of the lone squad trying to ride and stay awake for an entire week to rescue every single member of their scattered family spread like wildfire.

In a time of desperation, starvation, and fear, families sitting around campfires mused on that story and traded speculations and hopes. The squad was led by a scarred man with uncommon strength, that much was known to be true. Some of these families ran into Vanguard soldiers who had been at the Heart, and those soldiers put two and two together. That had to have been the man who, alone, penetrated Her Glorys personal shield with trickery and strength when all else seemed lost; the man who got in the best shot all day at the terrifying enraged demigoddess that now ravaged the worlds.

Those families then met Vanguard members who had known the squad. Kendrick, some said. They didnt remember his last name. Kendrick the Scarred, then. And some remembered Cheng, the man who had thrown a nuclear bomb into an evil closet dooryes, really, an evil closet doorand others remembered the fiery redhead, Randy. Some of the men remembered Jennifer Pixley from back in the training camps, of course, and a few tech guys had briefly interacted with Edgar Brace. The rest of the names and faces came from someone who had known them all intimately and claimed to have trained them.

The story became a currency of sorts, as pained wanderers traded hope for scant food and water.

There is a theory that, if billions of people focus their attention on an event, their combined selfless hope may alter the flow of reality itself. The stipulation here that many so often argue about still is that things might have gone differently if only the story had spread fast enough. As it was, due to lack of communication, billions were still trading the story and hoping for success long after the Week of Hell was over.

	<TEXT> Riding at dangerous speeds between low hills, the group headed for the rift to the next world while their current one cultivated a rising forest of explosions. Beams of yellow energy sliced across the clear sky above, while bombs on high arcs hit nearby artillery. None of the Grey Riders had spare attention to notice them, or, if they did, there were higher priorities. On this battlefield, human meant ally. It was unlikely that the enraged demi-goddess would be able to tell them apart, and it was unclear whether she would even care about the distinction.
 
Everywhere the squad turned, grey-clad men were taking position behind high portable walls of energy, tanks and artillery were moving forward, and random flak was killing those too slow to find cover in time. Each anonymous soldier that became fatally wounded disappeared in a flash of purple.
 
They have suicide pyramids on automatic triggers, Cheng realized. To hide their identities even after death.
 
Thats insane, Clint responded, riding close. Who the hell are these people?
 
Mona flinched as a barrage landed too close for comfort, showering her with snow. Anybodys guess. But the blood I drew from the girl charred of its own accord in the syringe. Its useless. Theres got to be some sort of nanotechnological mechanism in their circulatory system that destroys the blood if drawn or spilled.
 
The girl in question rode in their middle, her manner tense. She did not try to slow them down or interfere with the escape; she had been told she would be released at the portal, and she was likely terrified besides. There was no way she had seen combat before, or, if she had, it had not become second nature to her yet.
 
Edgar spared a moment to watch the movements of distant Grey Rider squadrons under fire. How many of them were young, old, or out of place on a battlefield? Just what the hell was going on here?! And what was so goddamn important that they had to conscript teenage girls and attach automatic suicide mechanisms to their own soldiers? Were these people even fighting under their own volition, or had they been forced into it?
 
But he had no spare thoughts to dwell on those questions now. Errant shrapnel hit his helmet, nearly knocking him over, and the adrenaline-jacked squad instantly veered hard right to avoid a falling line of fire.
 
Far along the speeding landscape, flickering violet and white made itself known. As they took hope, the sky overhead began to turn eerily void and yellow. It was as if night and dawn had come at the same time, each mixed together in mutual chaos, and that hope dimmed in their hearts. The collective roar of their engines rose as each man and woman used precious turbo fuel. If ever there was a time for speed, it was this.
 
A lone rider in grey approached from the left, heading to intercept at top speed. The squad tensed for the space of several nearby explosions until a voice came over the radio: Lian.
 
Howd you get a Grey Rider uniform? Mona asked.
 
Lian slid effortlessly into formation, but did not answer.
 
The snow-covered earth beneath their wheels began to rumble at a greater intensity than the engines themselves.
 
Cheng spoke to countermand what they were all feeling. Well make it.

Winters chill left the air, and a strange heat overtook them from behind.

Edgar held his breath, expecting pain at any moment; the portal rose in perspective and shot past around them, bringing sudden relief. He waved the rest of the squad on to a safe distance while he turned and brought their hostage to the edge of flickering violet. Remaining on his stationary bike with the kickstand down, he waved her forward with his gun. She sat on her bike and looked back, clearly fearful behind her black visor, but she did not move.

The enemys frequency was quieter now that many individual squads had switched primarily to team channels, but it still flowed with tense commands and grim chatter. Its the Vanguard squad here. We need Kendrick. We still have the hostage.

Nobody seemed to hear or respond to his request. It was a tough time, he knew, but surely someone had to be in charge of the captive? He repeated his hails for several minutes, watching as light and fire flared across the other realitys horizon. How could an exchange be made if nobody responded?

A particularly heavy strike beyond shook the ground; Edgar felt a subtle wave of nausea as his eyes registered shaking while his feet remained steady. In the distance, another lone rider approached. The stranger lacked a helmet, and seemed strangely

Kendrick! Edgar pulled slightly to the side of the rectangular violet rift, wary. When his scarred captain finally pulled through and came to a stop without incident, Edgar took off his helmet and said, What happened?

Go. Kendrick waved off their hostage. The girl took off at full speed without hesitation, heading right back into the fray. Breathing hard from adrenaline, he said, They let me go. 

Edgar frowned. They just *let you go?*

They had bigger fish to fry, he elaborated with an unhappy and pensive expression. But I lost my helmet, and they confiscated my handheld radio when they first captured me.

Handing his over, Edgar felt a strange sensation nipping at the edge of his thoughts. On the surface, this all made sense, but something about it felt wrong. What were the motivations of this enemy? What did the Grey Riders want? Without knowing these things, their moves were impossible to predict. Was that why they spent so much effort hiding their identities? Did they simply want to maintain unpredictability?

Lets continue, Kendrick said on his handheld. Im back, and time is still short.

The rest of the squad radioed happy cheers at his return, but Edgar just followed his friend and captain in a distant daze while his brain churned endlessly over unknowable variables.

The ride began anew, as all were eager to put that ongoing battle far behind them. 

But that was not truly possible, as war raged across the entire region. They would witness two smaller battles between Grey Rider legions and the forces of Her Glory before they finally reached Randy Ellwood.

---

Ive managed to access a sensor tower, and even set up a small shelter inside it, but Her Glorys calendar system isnt the same as ours. Son of a bitch! Is this a cruel joke? Why is simply *figuring out what day it is* the hardest thing in existence?

I think it might be because the date and time only matter to a civilizationand we have no civilization left. Looking at these system reports, Her Glory has kept an eye on not only her own worlds, but many nearby regions as well. With the Shield around the First World Empire gone, there should be *something.* Her sensor tendrils grow under the ground all over the place; theyve not gone that far yet, but there should still be *something.* Radio signals, maybe. Life signs? Is that a thing? Our homeland is a wounded sphere of silence, colorized only by general temperature readings taken at a distance.

I dont know what units shes using, so I cant tell how cold it is, but the average temperature for our homeland in her data is -24.02. That cant be too bad, right? It feels cold outside here, but not lethal, and it says the temperature in this reality averages 11.40. Id prefer to use Celcius, but I dont know it by instinctive feel; Im guessing its roughly forty to fifty degrees Fahrenheit here, which might put temperatures there at negative eighty but I refuse to believe that. I have no way of knowing for sure, and I hate not knowing for sure.

And even if it *is* that cold, its still survivable. And its just an average over the whole region. There are probably warmer parts of the Earth, and warmer realities, and two hundred billion people working hard to survive. Theyre alive and theyre fine. I have to believe that to be the case.

But our tribe, as it was put to usthe three hundred and fifty billion who could not be provided for, the tribe that we were supposed to lead into exodusI can see them on this sensor network, spreading out into the multiverse on foot like a massive cloud dispersing into darkness. They didnt wait for us, couldnt wait for us; or we didnt succeed in finding a place for them , or we didnt return in time, or we were never meant to return at all. Every plan humanity has ever had has fallen apart. Now we walk, scattered, into the wilderness.

I wonder what theyre eating. Im out of food myself.

And worst of all, the old civilization has been broken from us. If we cant even say for sure what day it is, after thousands of years of the day and time being known to exact degrees thanks to the mechanisms of society, then we are no longer the same people. We are no longer descended from that Empire. Who are we without a calendar? Well have to make our own, but itll never be legitimate.

How many days has it been? Im not even bothering to keep track anymore. Im hungry, and Im sick, but I know all I have to do is hole up in here and Kendrick will come. Theyll all come. They jumped into the portals. I saw them escape. Theyre alive.

But there are too many riders out there to find my particular family. There are Vanguard dispersed all over, but there are far more of the strangers in grey. I can see them on visual feeds, but they dont register at all on any other data collection mechanisms. I find that very odd. There are three entire realities, too, that have gone silent on the map. Theyre there; theyre just blank. Tracing the path we took, I recognize one of them as Amber Two.

The connection is obvious, but I cant fathom it. Why would the inhabitants of the Amber Worlds be maneuvering around Her Glorys devastated lands in such a military fashion? And why did they betray our best shot at salvation?

I built a radio out of parts stripped from these machines and tapped into nearby signals yesterday. Sometimes, I get Grey Rider chatter. Their robotic voices grate on my ears, but I keep hoping to catch some hint of what day it is. They talk of timelines and dates often, but their references are all over the place.

Also, after days spent studying maps of the region, I finally found a way out. The far end of Her Glorys domain was far less scrambled by the Devastation, so her wall realities are still in place. Nobody would survive a trip through one of them. Even at top speed, a trip through one of them cost us half of Kendrick. Those barriers are still in placeall except for one. The distant end of Her Glorys lands curve along her walls like a bowl down to a hole where fluid might drain. All roads lead to that passage.

Funny thing: Im not hungry anymore. I wonder how long Ive been here. Does the hunger stop when youre too far gone? Well, then Ill trade one type of energy for another. Ill continue this entry after I sleep.

---

Where is she? Kendrick asked, studying the jade cliffs with a wary eye. I dont like this at all.

Clint pointed west, along the base of the high jutting crystalline landscape, and the squad continued on along the oddly smooth and beautifully transparent landscape. The light of the sun lit an entire ocean floor in stasis underneath their feet, as if they were riding atop stationary waves, and it was hard not to look down in wonder.

Keep an eye out for amethysts, Kendrick ordered on his handheld. We have no idea if the truce is still on, or if they even understand the concept. He spied a strange biomechanical tower in the distance. That it?

Clint nodded.

As the tower grew nearer, they could see immense mechanical-organic conduits growing underneath the crystal like the roots of some vast tree. About a half-mile distant, violet and white shimmered underneath jade. The roots emerged directly from that light, appearing as if from nowhere.

Its growing, Mona said, mirroring what they were all thinking. Her Glorys technology is growing into the fractures!

I dont know how to feel about that, Kendrick muttered. And Im certain the Gemstone Hegemony wont take kindly to it. They still probably think we completed our initial task and destroyed her, but finding us herewho knows what theyll think. He checked an abandoned bike on its side against the tower, and called upward. Randy! No response came. *RANDY!* He turned to Clint. You sure shes up there?

Certain. Clint narrowed his eyes. This close, I can practically see her. Shes lying downno, I think shes asleep.

Concerned, Kendrick said, Wait here, and he put up his kickstand before leaving his bike and gripping the tower. There were numerous handholds and ledges, each blinking and moving in their own ways, and the thirty feet up presented little challenge.

The rest of the squad waited while Kendrick clambered inside the natural bolthole at the top.

Cheng kept watch on the jade cliffs above. Clint nervously bit at his fingernails. Edgar and Mona shared a glance. In her grey uniform, black helmet still on, Lian sat atop her bike and did not move a single millimeter.

The shout came a minute or two later. *Mona! Get up here!* There was a pause. *Edgar too!*

The two shared a far more worried glance, grabbed their relevant gear, and then sprinted toward the tower. Climbing up as quickly as was safe, they pushed into the bolthole one after the other. The small space within was filled with makeshift monitors and a hand-crafted radio. Supplies sat littered in various corners, and Kendrick was near the greatest pile, leaning over someone.

Monas medical training kept her calm as she studied the sight. Edgar went pale and clenched his fist.

Randy was asleep alrightand the biomechanisms had grown along her body. Into it, even.

Kendrick turned to them, eyes wide. Edgar, get on these computers. Figure out whatever you can. Mona

She nodded before he even gave the order. Cut those fucking things out of her.

Right.

They both moved to action, but space was tight. Feeling leadership fall to her since the situation was medical, Mona said, Kendrick. You have to wait outside.

Despite his visible fear for Randy, Kendrick accepted the order and climbed out.

Alright, Mona murmured, leaning close to study her patient by the multi-colored light given off by random nodes lining the inner workings of the biomachinery tower. Thin fiber cables had wormed their way through Randys clothing and into her skin, especially around her ankles, waist, and neck. Thicker metal conduits appeared to have drilled straight into her head. Ed, find out what you can about the ones connected to her brain. See if its safe to simply cut them. And find out if theyre trying to kill her.

He went to work immediately, tapping away at a keyboard that Randy had somehow stimulated into growthamong other tools. There was one thing he already knew. Theyre not trying to kill her, he said, his eyes on his work. Human brains have been interfaced with her systems before, acting as critical command and relay nodes.

Processing this, Mona said, Then we cant do anything that will risk her life, because death is not already on the line. Worst case scenario: we leave her like this.

That caught Edgars attention, and he turned to look at her in pained dismay.

Hurry, she said, getting out her tools to begin cutting away the fibers around her patients ankles. First, she removed Randys boots and sliced bits of uniform away. The redheads skin held mottled bumps where the fibers had penetrated and connected to her nervous system. Reaching up, she stuffed a lump of cloth into the girls lax mouth to keep her from biting off her own tongue. Randy, I hope you can hear me: this is going to hurt.

But no response came. Stilling her shaking hand using the calm of years of practice, Mona donned plastic gloves, wiped some disinfectant on the target area, and then brought her scalpel to her squadmates skin.

The glowing nodes in their cramped little surgical room flickered as the incision brought a swell of blood.

Both Edgar and Mona paused.

Edgar said it first. Shes connected in some way.

Wary, but lacking any other option, Mona began cutting again. The colored lights dimmed, and she brought out a flashlight; operating by its beam, she carefully pulled the first squid-like fibers out of her patients ankle.

Subtle vibrations moved through the machinery around them.

Edgar gulped, but Mona did not flinch. She kept gently pulling fibers out until the entire cable was freed. Coiling up the loose end and placing the bloody mess far away from her, she stitched up the incision and moved to the other ankle without wasting even a heartbeat.

The tower reacted around them at this second incision, but there was nothing to be done. Cutting and pulling quicker now that she understood what she was dealing with, Mona removed each fiber cable one by one, moving up her patients body until the surgeries became more complex in her neck region. Covered in sweat, but hyper-focused, she delicately removed each fiber and sealed up her entry wounds until only the major metal conduits at Randys temples remained.

It was then that Edgar spoke. Ive got it. See here on this screen? They havent penetrated her brain yet. They dont drill, they grow. Theyre slowly integrating with the bone tissue of her skull right now.

Hows this thing going to react when we mess with these bigger conduits? Mona asked, catching her breath.

Not well. Edgar gave her an apologetic expression. Theyre higher priority. Its automatic systems will classify it as an attack, and itll try to defend itself.

Mona stripped off her bloodied gloves and threw them with the piled fiber cables. Alright. Wait down below.

You sure?

She nodded unhappily. And get ready in case she and I have to jumpor fall.

Well get you, Edgar promised.

She grabbed him as he turned to climb outand kissed him hard without warning.

Red-faced, he stammered, What

Just go.

He grinned sheepishly, but did as he was told.

She returned to her patient. There was not going to be an easy way to do this: cutting through metal that thick was possible, but it would certainly not be quick. If the tower was going to defend itself, the danger was extremely high. On top of that, if the decision to leave Randy here like this was going to be made, it would have to be made alone. She would climb down and tell them Randy had died, and Clint would hopefully get her hint and back up her lie. It would have to be that way, because Kendrick would never leave a squadmate behindand certainly not Randy, his closest friend.

Sweat dripped from her nose. This time, it was not from the exertion of an hour of careful surgery.

But what if there were merits to Kendricks stance? Existence had tried to be harsh, tried to be cruel, tried to be mockingand hed simply said *no* at every turn. Could one really just say *no* to Fate?

Heart pounding, she carefully placed supports for the metal conduits so that they would not shear too badly, and then aimed her gun at one of them. How long would she have before the tower reacted? And what form would its self-defense take? If it simply crushed both of themno, it didnt have that kind of rapid response strength. Like Edgar said, it grew slowly. Would its defense, then, be a projectile? Electricity? She trembled mightily, her finger on the trigger, her gun pointed right at the conduit next to Randys temple. It wasnt an ideal surgical tool, but it was the only thing fast enough.

And it was absolutely, one-hundred-percent, beyond a shadow of a doubt *stupid*. That was why Edgar couldnt be here. It wasnt the danger: she didnt want him to see this crass method. She didnt want him to see that her skills as a doctor were useless in this situation. She didnt want anyone to see that.

She held her breath and began to squeeze the trigger.

She froze.

Stupid. Why should she do something self-admittedly stupid before all options had been exhausted? There were still greater stupidities to be explored. Putting her gun away, she turned to the keyboard and monitors and began scrolling through systems. This vast network was all connected, right? Then there was one user who could help.

How could she be contacted? Edgar would know how to do it, but he would also likely ask Kendrick if it was a good idea, and the whole thing would be out the window. Was there an instant messenger system on here? Holy shit, there was! A list of connections, too. One by one, she messaged all of them with a simple message: *help*. In effect, it felt like she was praying at an altar to a new kind of goddess.

Halfway down the list, the inside of the tower went dark, and a single light came on, pointed at her. Was this the opportunity she had hoped for? She frantically gestured toward Randy, and explained the situation even if she wasnt sure her listener spoke English.

The light went off, and she was left in darknesssave for her flashlight still sitting on a small ledge.

A strange metallic little winding sound echoed, and Mona turned quickly, staring.

Randy groaned. Everything hurts

Be careful, Mona told her, helping her sit up. I had to cut you up quite a bit. Lets get the hell out of here, and then Ill explain. She grabbed her equipment while Randy slowly did the same, and, together, the two climbed out and down.

Mona reached the jade surface first, and helped her patient down to the ground. They both turned to find the squad staring at them in wonder.

Randy was weak, but she ran to Kendrick, who laughed happily and ever so gently hugged her back. She pulled him down and kissed his forehead and cheek repeatedly, not caring one bit about his burned skin or bald head. I thought you were dead! I thought for sure

I was worried you were, too, he replied, visibly relieved. He looked over. It had you, but Mona cut you out of that stuff.

Yeah, Mona said, keeping what she had done to herself. She should be fine, if a little woozy from blood loss for a few hours.

Randy looked around happily, smiling at each of them, untilClint! she dashed over as quickly as her weakened limbs would allow and smothered him with a massive hug.

Surprised, Clint let it happen. It was the first reaction hed gotten that was positive; it didnt matter that Randy didnt know about his past. He began to openly cry, and hugged her back for long enough that it became awkward. Randy didnt care, though: she laughed and asked if hed succeeded in his special mission.

Remembering the cover story hed told, Kendrick cut in before Clint could respond and said, Yes. He did.

Good on you, Randy said. I knew youd come through.

A few moments of greetings and hugs followed with other members of the squad, but the mostly-complete reunion was cut short by Chengs warning. Look!

Dark helmets glinted on jade. Vast legions of Grey Riders glittered on the horizon, heading their way.

On your bikes! Kendrick shouted, already revving up. Lets go

But even as they donned their helmets and began racing after their bald leader, whose head glinted similarly under the sun, they witnessed vast rectangular violet opening onto the sky in the opposite direction, a terrible maw that emitted two floating mountains and surrounding swarms of flying black dots.

Grey Riders closing in on one side, Her Glory Enraged approaching from another, and a jade cliff at their backs, Kendrick called a stop and turned to his squad in alarm. Options?!

Mona froze. Had this been her fault? Shed given away their locationbut who had freed Randy? Or had that been intentional at all? Had it simply been the effect of the power being cut to prevent further access?

The first option to consider was the vast flat plain that awaited them in their fourth and final direction. The cliff blocked one way, the Grey Riders knew them as enemies now, and, while there was still a chance Her Glory remained friendly to the Vanguard, Lian wore a grey uniform, and there would be little opportunity to explain. The only route left was out onto the vast expanse to the south.

Rift compass shows nothing out there, Cheng found.

That way feels wrong, Clint added, shaking his head.

Edgar clenched a fist. Who knows how far that will take us off our path? Well never make it to Pixley and Carmen in time.

Lian finally removed her black helmet and spoke. If we go that way, we will survive.

No! Kendrick told her. We stick to the plan. We can still save both Jennifer and Carmen.

Oh? Lian asked, her expression hard. How tired are you? How many *days* have you been awake? Stimulants cant last forever. She looked to Mona.

Mona nodded unhappily. The hallucinations are going to get worse, and our decision-making is going to fall apart. She paused as she thought about what shed done in the tower. Its already happening. Well start passing out, too. Falling abruptly at fifty miles an hour could be deadly.

Like a dark angel of despair, Lian sat unmoving and watched with empty eyes.

*No!* Kendrick roared, bringing his fist up and slamming it down as hard as he could.

The flat jade cracked in a fractal rupture under the force of his blow.

The other members of the squad backed up a bit on their bikes, awed and concerned.

Stop considering options that leave people stranded! he shouted. Thats *not* what were doing! The rest of this insane nightmare be damned, we are *doing this.* We are going to ride until it kills us if thats what it takes. Be with me on this!

The others began looking at each other, gauging the general sentiment among their squadmates. The only exception was Cheng, who peered down between his handlebars. My beloved brothers and sisters, I must inform you: my gas light has come on.

The seven stood in stunned silence as the dire meaning of that little warning light sank in. Not only was the end of their journey nigh whether or not they wished it, Cheng might have to be left behind in short orderor he would have to ride with someone else, who would then have greater fuel consumption, thereby unzipping the squad as their bikes ran out of fuel faster and faster.

Everyone check your fuel levels, Randy said hopefully. The one with the most should give some to Cheng to balance things out.

With an eye on the closing pincer of deadly forces, Edgar added, And hurry.

While everyone compared fuel gauges, Lian said again: Its time to start thinking about survival. The journey is over.

Then lets save Carmen before we stop, Cheng said quietly. Please.

And leave Jen out there by herself? Randy asked, distraught.

Kendrick stood in place, still shaking his head. Jaw tense, moisture pooling in his eyes, he shouted, *The hell with this!* and struck the ground again with all the force of his rage-filled denial.

The cracks ruptured fully, and the surface gave way. In a tremendous crash and spray of crystalline debris, he and his bike fell out of sight.

There was no time for gawking or confusion. There were tunnels in the jade, invisible due to the lay of the substance, and hands pulled up their captain even as the surprise way forward became clear. There were only two options from their broken juncture: west under Her Glorys forces, or east under the Grey Riders. The flickering portal back out was east, so Kendrick picked east, and the squad rode through that underground crystalline tube as rapidly as they dared.

The air beneath was musty and stale, but breathable.

It must let out in various places, Mona guessed.

No conversation followed that statement. The rumble of legions overhead silenced all thoughts save quiet desperate hope that they would not be noticed. High above, jade silhouettes rolled past at high speed. There was nothing to be done and nowhere to hide, so the squad simply rode and hoped; heart rates high, exhaustion tailing them, they rolled down that tube single file and, at splits, simply chose whichever route went mostly east.

Edgar later wrote that he thought to say: *Something* made these tubes, but he realized at the last moment that such a statement would have been a disaster. Hed seen enough movies to know to shut up and accept their luck. His decision was wise, although hed had it backwards: nothing had made the tubes. Had the squad been on higher ground, they would have found that this world was not of the Gemstone Hegemony at all; it was the jade lake and cliff itself that had been produced by a lethal organism that happened to have been sleeping that yeardirectly beneath them, invisible in the same way the tubes had been. Speaking down there might have woken it soon enough to endanger the squad, but the battle certainly woke it only minutes later.

The seven were clambering out of a circular exit when it happened, but they were close enough to the exit portal to escape the fracturing crystal lake and leave that reality behind without ever truly understanding the horror they had narrowly missed. Later records would show that the engagement on the Jade Orb was one of the costliest of the entire Anonymous Warto both sides. In a rare hour of cooperation, a beacon broadcasting in all known languages was left, signed by both, warning that no one should ever return there despite the countless survivors left trapped, preserved, and aware in jade.

Knowing none of this, and struggling with the twin demons Exhaustion and Depletion, the squad pushed on, entering the final stretches of the Week of Hell. The road toward Jennifer Pixley became almost entirely one of flight, dodging, and briefly hiding; few realities along the fractures primary route were free from combat now.

It became clear that the Grey Riders numbered in the millions at the very least, and Randys information for the squad hinted that they had the full might and technology of at least three mostly undamaged Amber Worlds behind them. In a strange twist, the Earths that had been shot off into the multiverse to die for the Empire were now the only functioning civilizations in the greater region: they had been protected til the last by the very mechanisms that had eventually made them prime for sacrifice. Randy wondered aloud if *they* knew what the date and time were, but none were about to ask.

The others processed her words about the Empire being silent and cold, but no one knew what to say. Through worn-torn lands, they rode on in deep silence, using all their energy in peaceful hours simply to stay awake and fight off hallucinations. When they drew near to their destination, none needed Clints confirmation.

It turned out that he had been right about Jennifer Pixley: she could take care of herself.

---

I dont know if Ill ever see them again, but I hope I will. I dare to call them friends and family in my head. After I finally got free from that abusive bastard back home, I thought Id never be able to care about other people. Every bond was just a betrayal waiting to happen, and thats why I volunteered to secretly carry a different agenda than the squad. Its funny how far away that seems nowand yet still relevant.

Its time to get humanity the hell out of here. The Grey Riders and Her Glory have both gone insane, and these worlds are on fire. There are some of us Vanguard left, and a good number of them have given me the secret sign when weve met. It seems our collective agenda has not only survived the great scattering from Her Glorys Heart, but grown stronger as the rest of the Vanguard has weakened.

Twelve riders came with me from the Heart, and weve gathered two hundred more along the natural pathways that now seem to be fading. Its not enough to maintain bio-diversity, but there is also a tide coming inrefugees. Countless refugees. Theyre worried about food, because they havent eaten in weeks. Instead of turning on each other, theyve begun cutting off limbs and feeding them to their children. Its noble, but they cant see the bigger picture.

I probably wont be able to either, soon, since Im out of food, too. Worse, women that dont get enough calories cant have children. The bigger picture may be out of our reach for that singular overriding need. We lived in a civilization overrun with food, and now were fading without it. If we do manage to get these people to start having babies, things have to be different next time.

Well get that food. Weve stumbled across an Amber World pretending to be someplace else. They have the food we need, and were *not* going to ask.

---

The squad emerged from what had formerly been a highly guarded violet portal. For the first time in weeks, they found themselves not in the wilderness, but in a city. Smooth brick walls shot right up to heaven, and sidewalk concrete bumped under their wheels. A wide green sign for a coffee shop caught the eye on the left, and a sandwich chain on the right made the place feel like any city back home. It should have been a relief.

But the streets of this city were not clean. A staggering array of blood spatters, scorch marks, and bits of gore littered an area full of heavy gun placements. Two burning tanks faced each other, their main cannons down, their demeanors depressed.

Is this a hallucination? Kendrick asked, struggling to keep his eyes open.

Nobody wanted to confirm that the horrible city blocks full of death were real.

It was Mona, scanning for survivors, who noticed first. Where are the bodies?

Cheng pointed. It looks like theyve been dragged away.

Distant gunfire echoed.

Kendrick forced himself to greater wakefulness. Its not over! We have to help them!

While they all kicked up their stands and readied to move, Randy said, Wait one second She grabbed a stray riding helmet that looked Vanguard and handed it to Kendrick. Its not safe for you to ride without one, and its harder to communicate. Edgar is still missing a handheld, but this is a step in the right direction.

He smiled as he took the helmet and slipped back into its secure embrace. Randy had been through a strange experience, but some things never changed.

And it *was* Vanguard. The others were too tired to catch the reveal, but Kendrick was forced to see it: Vanguard riders were here. Had they been helping, and gotten caught up in the crossfire of whatever threat had pushed through this portal?

They veered around skyscraper corners and rode down streets filled with burning cars, shattered storefronts, and random debris from damage higher up on the buildings. Radio silence, Kendrick murmured, instead leading by hand signals.

The others didnt need to be told. Something was seriously wrong here. There was no sign of Her Glorys armadas, which tended to fly in great swarms, and there were no bodies. Clint pointed up twice and then down to his knee, indicating that Jennifer Pixley was *that way* but *getting closer.* His face, seen through his visor, was fearful.

They rolled quietly around another cornerand saw them.

Dirty beyond comprehension, missing limbs in many cases, and ravenous, a good twenty of the creatures sat around a bonfire *cooking and eating* pieces of bodies from a massive pile of gore and death. The larger ones passed cooked pieces to the smaller ones

Horrified and praying this was a hallucination, Kendrick pulled out his gun, and the others did the same.

Shit, Mona interrupted, taking off her helmet to speak without her radio. Those are humans!

There were tears of disgust and rage in more than one pair of eyes. Backing up slowly as they comprehended who and what they were seeing, the squad each took another stimulant and tried to keep it together.

I understand, Edgar gasped, vomiting once. I get it He choked for a moment, and then breathed in. This is the consequence of us failing our mission.

No, Randy countered, wiping tears away. We were never really intended to succeed. We were sent away to start anew.

Lian offered her brutal perspective. Those people should have died in the cold. They are now a problem; a threat to our survival, and to the continuation of the species.

I wont kill them, Cheng said quietly. Theyve got children with them.

If theyre eating people, its likely prion disease will become rampant, Mona forced out between disgusted breaths. Theyll all go insane and die in a few years. Seven years, maybe more.

Kendrick held his new helmet in his hands and leaned his forehead against the skyscrapers wall. But theres a chance they wont, right?

A chance. Individually. En masse, though, there *will* be deaths.

Clint added his point. Pixleys not far away.

She is likely in danger, Cheng said, casting aside other concerns.

Kendrick nodded. Lets get her and get far away from this place.

The scavengers were no threat to seven experienced riders on motorbikes. Racing past between abandoned cars, the squad completely bypassed them. Feasting as they were, the dirty families hardly took notice.

More gunfire echoed ahead, punctuated by several booms that sounded like artillery. The squad came around a corner to see a huge number of riders speeding through the streets, using their agility to frustrate a massive tank and its slow-moving cannon. The armored vehicle had been gutted underneath, and could not move. The riders themselves were all wearing Vanguard uniforms.

	<TEXT>  I think this question goes here:
 Was Gisela inspired at all by Yawgmoth from Magic: The Gathering? Thinking about it (which is the sort of thing I do during slow nights at work), she's kind of an inversion of the infamous Father of Machines. (Not just a white mana version either, which is arguably more terrifying than the original.)
 Or maybe it's just an artifact of the similarities between the settings and I just need to get off graveyard already.

Fantastic question! I actually loved the concept of Yawgmoth and I read all of the Magic the Gathering books back when they ruled. There's still a stack in my car right now, actually. I didn't have him or the Phyrexians in mind, though, beyond what the squad *fears* she is like. For me (and I don't consider this a spoiler but if you're worried don't read ahead), Gisela's role for our team is an exploration of where we will be going in the next few decades with self-enhancement technologies such as limb replacement, including reactions to said limbs and the fact that those limbs can be better than organic. It'll certainly transform our world, to the point that people 50 years from now might look like monsters to us here in 2016. The concept grew organically (no pun intended) from Gisela's need to help people - her first inventions were to heal wounds and ease pain, and the rest followed from there over the centuries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find that pauses are bad. It's like taking a break from lifting weights at the gym; a day or two is necessary for rest, but longer than that doesn't help and just makes it harder to start again.

Instead, I shift that productivity so that my brain never gets used to not writing. Here it sounds like there's an opportunity for you to write about combining your 5 different tools in the wild. Produce something unique along that vein perhaps? The key is that you have to enjoy what you're doing on some level, or you will eventually stop.

	<TITLE> Phase III has already begun </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a literal transcription of the events of January 12th, 2016. It was a Tuesday, and the weather was garbage. Cruddy ice on everything, high winds blowing snow all over the place, and it took me eight minutes to clean off my car before I could drive it. That is my official excuse for being an hour and ten minutes late to work.

At 11:02, I took a lunch hour. When I returned at 12:07, six high schoolers were already in the annex waiting for me. They were agitated and confrontational, but they insisted that some sort of inhuman force was *invading* their nearby town, so I followed standard procedure.

Well, as close to standard procedure as possible. Weve been less funded as of late. I split the six into different interview rooms, as was standard, but interviewed them all myself. Had their stories all been wildly different or exactly the same, I would have sent them on their way, but they each told the tale from their own perspective. Each was riddled with minor inconsistencies, errors, and differing opinions on what had happened. That was troubling, because it was realistic. Furthermore, they were each from different social circlesthere were the usual hidden crushes and facetious dramas, but none of these kids truly liked each others company, and it seemed possible that they had only been thrown together by circumstance.

At 14:18, the interviews were complete, and I made these recorded assessments. Having passed the first few checks, something which none of our regular flow of crazies have really managed in the last few years, I told them that we believed their story and that Id pass on their concern to the higher-ups. Meanwhile, I let them wait in the annex with blankets and coffee. They soon learned from a news report on the annex televisionand from the rumble underneath their feetthat their town had just been destroyed in an unspecified nuclear accident.

True crazies never made it this far, so we only took that step for those that were sane but probably lying. Thus, thinking their lies had gotten everyone theyd ever known killed, this was usually where they broke down screaming and crying. When these six kids did *not* break down crying, but instead held hands and consoled each other that it had been *necessary* but *now it was over*, I spit out my coffee and fumbled for the manual. I knew that it was somewhere in the security station that I was watching from, but wed never actually needed further procedure before. At 14:47, I found the Phase II manual under a stack of unnecessarily printed-off emails.

Because their town had not actually been destroyedthe annex just has rumble mechanisms under the floor, and the television just plays a modifiable pre-recorded newscastif there really was a threat, said threat was still alive and well. Id never heard of one of these tales turning out to be true, but that didnt mean the military didnt have guys like me tucked away all over the place just in case. Call this number in case a horror movie breaks out, more or less. *Everyone* would know if a massive creature ever attacked from the oceans or from space or something, sure, but my type of office was for handling insidious subterfuge scenarios. So, theyd seen strange changes in their community, theyd Googled it, and theyd come to me.

First priorities for Phase II were: determine whether any of the six were under the influence of the threat, register a pre-emptive call higher up the chain of command in case I was later compromised, and then check out the town myself. I really didnt like that third one, and I opted to delay that as long as possible without doing anything that might increase my risk of a court martial.

I sent a call over to Wright-Patterson and spoke to a Private Taylor, who refused to register my Phase II codes, citing excuses such as Thats ridiculous, and So like what, aliens? Monsters?

When I told him I didnt know the threat classification yet, he hung up. That was not a good sign. Of course, his procedures manual for this had been lost or never requisitioned at all, and I didnt really believe it myself, so I couldnt blame him. I called increasingly distant bases until someone finally agreed, with a sigh, to open a ticket just in case. It was important I did not have access to it so that I could not close it if I was later compromised.

Compromised  I hate that word. It stuck with me, raising my heart rate, as I finally left my security station and met the six kids in the annex. By now, one of them had used a cell phone to call home, thus discovering that Grand Rapids had not been destroyed after all. Also, one of them had apparently gone red-eyed and been murdered by the others.

It was necessary to set fire to the potentially biohazardous corpse while it was still within the annex, which triggered the sprinkler system, causing copious water damage on top of the fire damage and future decontamination costs that had already been incurred.

Of course, this was also increasing proof that their story was true. There was always a chance it was a hoax, but, experiencing fear and anxiety as I was at the time, I decided that behaving as if it was mostly true would be the optimum way to move forward. I say mostly true because they could have been tricked, misinformed, or just wrong on the important points. Their scientific analyses were clearly warped, as they continually referenced *The Thing*, *The Faculty*, and an early episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. These were works of fiction, and thus unreliable.

After telling the kids to head further on to Wright-Patterson and insist on being heard, my personal stress and sense of imminent danger rose as I continued to follow procedure. There was only the last step left in Phase II: check out the town myself. To save paperwork, this transcription of events is also a formal complaint against the Phase II manual, particularly this highly questionable procedure. In the future, I suggest that Phase II be replaced with a natural progression on the fake nuclear accident testwe should minimize personnel risk and possible retraining expenses by immediately destroying the town for real.

I proceeded by car to Grand Rapids. Driving around the outskirts of town, my observations found nothing amiss, which was definitely a bad sign. If there had been space slugs in the streets or a giant lizard attacking, I could have pawned the whole thing off on a different department, but insidious infiltration scenarios were my responsibilityand the primary attribute of an insidious infiltration is the fact that nothing looks amiss. Thus, when a nice old man walking his dog waved at me, I made a face and sped away.

A little deeper into town, I noticed police blockades along many of the main exits. DUI checkpoints, or something sinister? Most of the drivers who would seek to leave or pass through Grand Rapids would be stopped by these checkpoints. Was that all it took? Just a moments personal contact? I began cycling through the possibilities: virus, parasite, hypnotism none boded well.

Two young men in grey hoodies ran down the street as fast as they could, passing my window and pushing off of my car, while several townsfolk jogged in unison around the same corner. Just people out for a run, or a slow and methodical entrapment? 

Proof would be very difficult to come by. Too, the longer I drove around, the more attention I attracted. When I saw a few policemen climbing in their cars, I left at high speed. It was also becoming clear that the social structure of society itself held more power than any of the people in it; what could I do here if the police had all been taken under by an inhuman agenda?

I returned to my office and added what Id observed to this ongoing record. I called Wright-Patterson again, and, this time, Private Taylor was completely cordial and asked me to come in for a debriefing with the higher-ups. That was a nice and unexpected change in attitude, but, after I hung up, I made sure to check the Phase II manual again. It said, specifically, that if anyone that was once rude suddenly became cordial and invited one to a meeting, absolutely *do not go.* It occurred to me that Id sent those sixnow fiveteens on over to the base without truly verifying theyd all been fully human. Sure, theyd murdered one of their own, but what if *that* had been the human one? I had no idea what was happening, after all, so the red eyes could have been a symptom of resisting the foreign influence rather than being controlled by it. Had I been played?

Compromised. If a base the size of Wright-Patterson was compromised, and if the police and emergency services were compromised, and a whole town and more besides, what could I even do about it? Without proof, and without any individual power whatsoever, the answer was more or less nothing at all.

Powerlessness didn't begin to describe it. Outside the annex, under orange evening light, I saw four rows of townspeople standing in the parking lot. They stood with militaristic posture and simply watched me from afar. I locked the door and readied my weapon, but they knew that I knew that they could just wait me out. Hunger and thirst would break any siege eventually.

And, then, the power went out. They'd cut the external; my backup generator is running low. I considered shooting myself...

No. I had to rely on the procedures. Somebody had thought ahead for this situation. Somebody had planned for this, set up defenses and countermeasures, and designed effective procedures. I just had to find said procedures, and my methodical life would continue exactly the way it always had.

I rooted around my office, went through every cabinet, searched every closet, and picked through every stack of books.

I held out that hope for nearly an hour, but when I finally found the Phase III manual, my heart sank. The massive book held hundreds of blank pages and only one phrase: *If youre reading this, its already too late.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exhaustion does strange things to the human mind. Around hour sixty of the Week of Helltwo and a half days of solid riding, save for the stop to rescue Chengperceptions began to falter.

At the time, the team was riding through a warm rainstorm on vast salt flats that had, prior to the inclement weather, held no sign of change in any direction. With the sheets of water flying at them at speeds equal to their own, they were forced to hunker down over their handlebars and peer ahead through visors flowing with water. None of them directly felt the exhaustion, thanks to the powerful stims now being handed out every few hours by the squads doctor, but the effects were still creeping up on them.

Lightning flashed, and the sound of breathing echoed in Kendricks helmet. Whose radio is on? Who is that? 

What do you mean? Mona asked. She rode to his right, a hunched-forward silhouette in the mists and rain. Her helmeted head turned toward him.

Edgars voice reached him. Its you, Kendrick. Youre hearing yourself.

Sorry, he muttered, shaking his head forcefully for the tenth time in as many minutes. Hows everyone doing?

Fine, Mona lied neutrally.

Im alright, Edgar lied, his voice strained.

Cheng had an advantage of time and rest over them. Holding in there, sir.

Kendrick felt himself space out for a moment before he re-focused and said: Clint.

Im here, the other man said meekly.

It was good enough.

Raising his arm in front of his helmet, Kendrick protected his visor from the rain and used the clarity to peer at distant shadows moving in the patterns ahead. There was a new sound; not his breathing, but his heart. Much of his innards had been taken, but it was still his faithful heart that beat in his chest. He was still human, he told himself. That beating proved it; that beating grew louder in his senses, backed by the rushing sound of a forceful riverthe blood moving in his ears.

The longer he stared ahead, the more that rhythm seemed to become the shout of armies backed by the drumbeat of war. He shook his head. This *was* a war, goddamnit! A war against everything in the multiverse, a war against existence itselfa war for the right to *live* and *progress* and *build* rather than just constantly lose everything anyone held dear. Wake up, he said through gritted teeth, not loud enough to be picked up by his helmet radio.

The water kept flowing down along his sight, curved visually by his speed; his front wheel turned below, constantly churning salt; air continually pulled at his increasingly disheveled and burned jacket. The world just kept cycling like a short movie on a loop, and he began to feel strangely unreal. To his left and right, he began seeing the silhouettes of other riders on other bikes, as if their small squad had become absorbed in a much larger legion.

And indeed they had started with such, and lost it all out in the wilds. These were the phantoms of probability, and the grey ghosts of men, riding alongside out of a higher duty to provide what scant comfort and protection they could.

Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. The rains intensified, and the hallucinations were gone, lost in the shifting patterns. For a brief second, Kendrick thought he heard a small burst of static from his radio, and a single word spoken with the voice of his fatherbut his senses simply could not hold the texture of the sound in his awareness.

Could they really do this for four more days? Hed presented a firm *no* to Edgar and to existence itself when told that not everyone could be saved. He wondered if, deep in his own core, he truly believed it was possible.

It had to be. Leaving a member of this new family behind was not an option. There was no choice anymore: if they failed in this desperate race, Carmen, being the last, would be the one to be left alone. During a flash of lightning, he thought he could almost see her holding up his bike in that horrible mechanized tunnel whose surgical arms had ripped out his ribs. Hed blacked out, then, but hed known he would not fallnot while she held him up.

A blast of light and clear air tore away the storm, and he screamed in shock before realizing they had all ridden right through the intended portal. Rectangular and violet, it flickered behind them, subtly losing strength with each passing moment. Fortunately, no one made comment at his tired shriek.

Slowing to look aroundand slowing because the air was suddenly biting cold against his wet clotheshe saw that they had reached their described destination. High trees, thick forests, and foot-deep snow were all accurate to Monas report. Which way, Clint?

Coming forward to ride alongside him, Clint pointed with a gloved hand. That way. Shes that way.

To his right, Kendrick saw Edgar and Mona turn their helmeted heads to share a glance. That wasnt the first time hed seen them do that since Lian had become their next rescue. You two wanna tell me something?

No, its fine, Mona said flatly.

Do I have to make it an order?

Edgar seemed about to say that they werent truly soldiers and didnt have to follow orders, but that seemed like too great a can of worms to open. He sighed and radioed, Lians not herself.

Kendrick closed his eyes for a moment, but did not let himself fall into the relief of sleep. All he felt was disappointment. Your stomach wounds.

Yeah, Edgar admitted sadly. When we thought she was dead, there was no need to bring it up.

Well figure something out, Kendrick promised tiredly. He was completely at a loss for the moment, and could only hope some opportunity would present itself, but he wasnt about to let on. They didnt have time to doubt his confidence, though, because the trees suddenly endedand the bodies began.

---

3:12 PM. ?.?.15. Lian has done a terrible thing. Lian is lost, and she no longer knows what to do.

---

Thankful for the relatively sealed space of his helmet, Edgar worked his bike between the snow-covered bodies alongside his squadmates. Some looked like large four-legged insects, but close inspection was impossible through the rime and mayhem. Many were humanbut they were not Vanguard. There were some men, but just as many women and children.

Refugees, Cheng had realized first. Survivors!

Not quite, Kendrick had replied, sad.

The trees ended in carved plains that looked like they had once been set up for farming. Now, only snow and mass death blanketed them. Looking forward into the distance, Edgar felt his heart seize. The bodies *just kept going.*

Worse, he was more sleep deprived than hed been letting on. He kept thinking he saw movement among the icy corpses. The team was surrounded; should these bodies rise, there would be no escape. It was a classic horror scene, and only he was savvy enough to see it. Shaking, he pulled his gun and aimed it the gape-mouthed corpse of a small boy that had almost certainly begun to leap up at him.

Monas shout and touch shook him out of it, and he apologized quietly.

At the sight of that particular body, somebody sobbed. Was it *Clint?* Or was he hearing things, too?

Tell me everything that happened, Kendrick asked as he worked his way through up ahead.

Edgar looked to Mona, who nodded for him to elaborate on their shared secret. When we jumped through the portals, we found ourselves on the surface of Her Glorys world, somewhere random in the carnage. Lian was with us.

What was her mental state?

She was screaming. Crying, even, and completely incoherent. I think the reality of what happened was sinking in.

Mona added a thought. It seemed like she was fighting with herself, too. Out loud.

I tried to grab her, Edgar continued slowly, his hand unconsciously moving to his poorly-healed abdomen and the sphere still sitting in acid in his stomach. And she stabbed me a lot.

So thats how you got wounded, Kendrick said. I was wondering. What then?

She ran off, Mona finished for him. Shrieking with horror, or at least thats what it sounded like. She just kept saying over the radio: *Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry.* We heard the gunshot a moment or two later.

Taking a deep breath, Edgar said, We thought it was pretty clear what happened.

Welp, shes alive, Clint said blithely.

Inside his helmet, Edgar frowned, even though nobody could see it. Yeah, *I know.*

You survived, Cheng said diplomatically. Lian was not in her right mind. Well find her, and well help her. Do you hold a grudge?

Searching his feelings, Edgar could only hear the poor girls screaming and crying, and her disappointment in herself at what shed done. No no I dont think so.

Mona squeezed his arm supportively, and he clasped that hand for a moment. Despite the heavy conversation, he couldnt help but wonder: what was up with Mona recently? The former awkwardness and unspoken distance between them seemed to have been left behind in the Heart of the Yellow Palace.

Up ahead, Kendrick stopped his bike abruptly. Theres a giant hole.

Cheng motioned for them to stay back and guard Clint while he went up and looked with Kendrick. They both disappeared down out of sight for one minute, and then two. Among the three exhausted riders, the thought definitely circulated: how long do we wait? What if theyre in trouble? What if theyre already dead? Edgar even thought he heard someone shouting for help, but a shake of the head dispelled that hallucination.

The report finally came. There are people down here!

Mona replied for the three of them. What? What people?

Survivors! Come on down!

She moved to push forward, but Edgar gripped her arm cautiously. Why dont one of you come back up and get us?

A tense few heartbeats passeduntil Kendrick appeared from below and waved them over eagerly.

Relieved, the three pushed forward among the bodies until they could see down the giant hole Kendrick had been talking about. It looked carved by chitinous scraping, and, indeed, it had been. A half mile along the gentle ramp, they could see two bundled humans and a large insect of some sort lounging in a sparse entry room.

Edgar stared during the entire approach. It was a *creature*an upright insect on four black legs seemingly made of shining smooth bonebut it looked about with sentient presence, and made no move to attack. Was this the first organic non-human civilization humanity had ever made true political contact with? He began running over all his favorite Star Trek episodes in his head.

But there was no time. Kendrick got what information he could out of the two guards, shook their hands forcefully (making their eyes go wide in the process), and then ordered an ascent with an unhappy tone. Once out of earshot, he radioed, There are extensive underground tunnels which contain the bulk of insect civilization here. After a horrific initial conflict, which more or less destroyed the surface for this seasons intents and purposes, somehow peace was brokered. Theyve taken in refugees.

How many? Cheng asked, a rare happiness in his voice.

Nobody knows for sure. A good number in the billions, Kendrick continued. But the peace is fragile, and all our people are underground to survive the cold. If the truce should break down, theyll be sitting ducks.

Mona asked, Why would the truce break down? This is great news.

The peace is fragile, Kendrick said again. And a lone *monster* has been stalking the surface, entering through unknown means, and murdering insects. Just insects. Not humans.

Lian Mona sighed with concern.

Clints voice cut in. He was rightfully confused. Sorry, what exactly is going on with this person? She sounds totally insane.

Mona took him aside and explained things in quiet tones, and Clint just gave a very deep shrug, admitting it was far from his place to judge.

Meanwhile, Edgar said, You know what this means, Kendrick? He laughed hopefully. Survivors at allthese people being hereit means the three hundred and fifty billion we left behind didnt just sit idly by and freeze to death. Theyre fleeing across the multiverse on foot!

Their tired Captain sat taller on his bike, nearly reaching the low rock ceiling with the top of his helmet. Jesus, youre right. He took off his helmet to give a loud whoop. Humanitys not done yet!

But what can we do to help?

Nothing yet. Or, for the moment, saving our family coincides with the needs of the many. Kendrick slid his helmet back on, turned, and said over the comms. Lets take care of their monster.

Even knowing where she was, it was a hard task finding their solitary hunter. Through dense high trees, the five rode with wary caution, eyes on all fronts. In the end, she still got the drop on them, and only stopped short as something in her recognized those that fallen into her trap.

Kendrick held her at bay by the wrist while she struggled internally. Her hair was beginning to grow back, short black contrasting her white make-shift camouflage, and Edgar stared. Without a specific date to mark the days, time was slipping by at an unknown rate.

Lian, its us, Kendrick said with compassion.

She struggled harder, and seemed to be fighting verbally with herself.

Edgars fine, Mona told her. See?

Edgar lifted his shirt, where scars remained from the spheres internal work. Ive got some interesting tattoos now, but thats about it.

Slowly, Lian began to grow quiet.

We need your help to get Carmen back, Cheng said, touching her shoulder.

She reacted violently to that touch, but then took a deep breath and stared down at the ground.

Kendrick let her go.

There was no more conversation. There were no apologies, no heartfelt discussions, and no emotional speeches. Lian simply climbed on her bike, donned her helmet, and joined them. 

Edgar watched her for a time. Her helmet now covered the awful trace wound alongside her temple where the bullet had sliced open her head, but he could still see the wound in his minds eye. This was no trick or ploy like the point he'd made all those weeks ago with an unloaded gun: she had actually shot herself, and failed to die. What had she done then? Had she run off? This area was near a primary fracture, so her flight had been direct.

But with Bills loss, she seemed to have no capacity for conversation or caring left in her. Why was she rejoining the squad? Was it simply habit at this point? Or would her squadmates be her next victims?

His dark thoughts stopped when she looked back from the front. Her visor pointed directly at him for several heartbeats as she made sure he was alive and whole. It was the most apology he would ever get, but he gritted his teeth against a sudden moisture in his eyes nonetheless. She was not an unfeeling monster, just a broken human; for that simple action, for looking back with unspoken regret for what shed done in a moment of panic, he forgave her.

Without another word, now numbering six, they moved on from that place of ice, death, and hope. While none of them would ever return there, their removal of the Monster became enshrined in local legend, complete with an imagined glorious battle whose lead champion was a horribly scarred man with strange strength.

The ride began anew, with more than seventy hours of exhaustion drilling into the minds of most. With Lian the most rested, and Cheng the next, the two took the front. Subtly, and secretly, nobody wanted Lian riding behind them just yet, but she would prove to be a life-saving asset in the bloody fight that was already unknowingly upon them.

Surrounded by blinding snow and heavy fog, the six rode in tired silence. Again, Kendrick lost his focus in the ongoing driving precipitation, and, again, he imagined he saw the silhouettes of other riders all around them. This time, though, he had just taken a stimulant pill, and his senses were a little clearer. Adrenaline shot through his chest as he realized the other bikes were real. Worse, as seen through a brief gap in the driving white, they were not Vanguard.

The six of them were riding among hundreds. They were right in the center of a legion of Grey Riders.

Edgar, he radioed, tense. This is a primary route for the next few days, right?

Yeah. What of it?

Would smart people be using this same route to get around Her Glorys region?

Yeah. Edgar glanced off into the driving snow. Oh, shit.

Through whirling gaps in white, the others began to see the situation.

Keep doing exactly what were doing, Kendrick hissed. Were all just silhouettes and bikes out here. They wont look hard at us unless we call attention to ourselves.

Ahead, to either side, and behind, grey silhouettes rolled against white. Sometimes, a nearby squad would drift a little closer, and Kendrick ordered a subtle move awayonly to see the other side grow near, requiring another correction. The storm was intense, but it would not last forever. This time, the nervous breathing on the radio was real, and communal.

How long until the next portal? Kendrick asked, panting against the adrenaline burning in his veins. The moment we cross out of this storm, were dead. Theyll see us.

Another forty minutes, Edgar responded quickly.

Mona cut in. Ed, slow down your breathing. Youre going to pass out.

Trying!

We will survive this, Cheng stated, his tone strained but confident.

Throughout, Lian had said nothing. Now, she drifted closer to Kendrick, and spoke on a one-to-one channel. *We should kill him.*

Angling his head sharply to face her as she floated closer in the roaring rivers of air and snow, Kendrick asked, Who?

He could almost feel her grin behind her visor. Their leader.

It was a terrible idea objectively, full of incalculable risk, but it brought controland as Lian was implying with her hunger, opportunityto an otherwise crisis situation. With a legion this big, there had to be a leader, and leaders always rode at the front. You and me, he said quickly, before glancing back to speak to the others. Everyone, continue on. Lian and I are going to drift ahead.

What?

Why?!

Well take out their leader, he said, grim. For what he did to Gisela, and to cause a distraction so the rest of you can escape. More outcries followed, but he insisted. Its an order. We have three more members of our family out there in the multiverse all alone. Save them. Then, Clint can lead you all back to Lian and I.

The tension was high, and the situation barely under control, but there was no choice.

Kendrick and Lian began slowly pulling away as they sped up to snake among the enemy legion. The two had no idea that far greater events were at play than their own, or that the fires of the Anonymous War were already raging around them, but their purely coincidental covert assault happened to be extremely poorly timed for the Grey Riders.

I found their frequency, Lian murmured.

In the depths of fatigue, Kendrick felt stupid for not thinking of that before. Quietly, he tuned to the indicated channel and listened to the surrounding chatter from the sea of anonymous riders. For a time, he eavesdropped on conversations about movements, ranges, and plans. It was only as they came up on what appeared to be the lead squad that he realized there was absolutely no personal talk. This legion knew that radio transmissions were not secure, and they were likely laser-focused on maintaining anonymity. No conversations involved identifying information.

That level of dedication was worrisome.

Shaking his head to try to clear the fog of sleep deprivation, he led Lian further through the actual fog and snow until they were both right behind what the patterns indicated would be the lead squad. As he studied the positions of riders around him, he realized: although they were close together because of the low visibility, they were using a variant of the Vanguards own highly responsive formation. The plan presented itself in his thoughts as he crafted the proper stimulus to get them all to move the way he wanted.

After communicating his plan to Lian, he steeled himself for danger. They could just stay in the storm and drift out to safety as long as they didnt do anything drastic. This was a foolish and angry plan, fueled by that fire inside his chest that refused to die. He began thinking better of ituntil he thought about the unprovoked attack that had sent nuclear fire roiling through the underhalls of Giselas home. Why had they done that? *Why?* Full of heat and action, he tuned back to the legions frequency and shouted: *CLIFF AHEAD! HARD RIGHT!*

Joining with him, Lian faux screamed: *IT DROPS! GO RIGHT!*

Instantly, Kendrick felt the entire legion shift around him like a flock of birds adjusting direction. Bikes began streaking by laterally as the countless squads reacted to the apparent unseen danger by veering to the right. The only ones who would not veer would be the ones at the very front, who would question how anyone had warned of a cliff ahead when they themselves were in the lead. Many of that lead squad turned, but, confirming that he had guessed correctly, the first few did not. Burning some of his small quantity of boosted speed, he led Lian straight against the current of bikes. Like a pair of hawks swooping down on prey, they grabbed each side of the lead motorcycle and turned a hard left.

They only had a few seconds before that rider figured out what was happening and forced a tumble, but it was enough. The legion had lost direct sight of their leader, and, with the fog and snow shrinking visibility down to less than five feet, they would never find their way back in time to prevent the fight.

Tumbling and sliding through the snow, Kendrick fought his own momentum to climb to his feet. His helmet lost in the crash, he felt dizzy, but refused to let it hinder him. The Grey Leaderso noted by a small decoration on his uniformwas just clambering up in a daze. Furious beyond hesitations of morality, Kendrick whipped out his handgun and fired. The shot darkened grey fabric, stopped by bulletproof armor underneath, and his target bent forward in pain only to rise up quickly to fire back. The hit ricocheted from Kendricks temple, and he reeled. His gun fell away in the snow, lost forever only a foot away.

Stepping around his fallen bike, the Grey Leader moved forward for a better shot which never came. Lian swooped out of the fog as if truly a hawk in descent for a kill. Landing atop the opponents back, she first struck his black helmet with her knife. Failing to do any damage, she stabbed lower, in the shoulder. The man turned and swung her down into the ground with a thump, but was clearly injured, and his gun had flown off into the snow besides.

The attack had given Kendrick enough time to re-focus and slog forward through the snow to throw a heavy fist. The Grey Leader, playing it safe, threw some small spark-like device down; hitting the ground, it shot a brief temporary shield of energy up, which resounded forcefully and collapsed under the weight of Kendricks biomechanical strength. Astounded, but not stunned even for a split second, the opponent dodged back repeatedly to avoid letting those slow and heavy strikes land, for just one would be fatal.

A splash of black liquid fell across the opponents neck from somewhere unseen.

Lians poison? Kendrick kept up his assault while the other mans reactions grew slower and dull. Lian rushed from the whiteout behind even as the anonymous man pulled a pill from a small pocket on his wrist and swallowed it. In seconds, he was quick again, enough to dodge Lians knife and knock it to the ground with his uninjured arm. That act cost him time, and Kendrick swung down with all his strength.

The Grey Leader fell flat into the snow, barely avoiding the swing. A kick came up, but failed to do anything to his biomechanical leg. Rolling away, the opponent eyed both of them as the three combatants circled each other. A computerized emotionless voice echoed out. **What are you.**

*Who* are *you?* Kendrick demanded. Why did you betray humanity?

**You know nothing.** That black visor and helmet scanned the area quickly. Tapping a data pad on his wrist, he said, **Burned alive. You are Kendrick Merrill believed dead. Where is the rest of your squad.**

Far from here, he spat. Youll never find them.

**Close, then. How close.**

Kendrick moved to charge again before the enemy could figure anything else outbut the sound of numerous guns being readied stopped him.

The legion had found their Leader.

Raising his hands in defeat, his heart smoldering with fury, he nodded at his helmeted squadmate, who ignored the guns pointed at her and disappeared into the fog and snow like a phantom that had never been there to begin with.

Death, Kendrick had expected, but capture was a surpriseand, he realized, probably worse for his team. He resolved not to give up any more information, not even accidentally.

It was unclear what was going to happen to him, but there was never a chance to find out. At the time, Edgar and the others were reacting:

---

When Lian radioed that Kendrick had been captured, I knew we had to act. We were not completely out of the legion yet, which had grown chaotic looking for their lost leader, so we had a chance. We found the farthest straggler and tackled him. Dragging him out into the snow, we held a gun to his neck and told him that he would die only if he began to radio for help.

He said nothing until we tried to take his helmet off. **You cant.**

Even with the anonymizer at work, his voice sounded high, and held subtle undertones of fear. I needed as much information as possible in order to play the game, so I bit. Why not?

**My helmet is rigged with explosives. If you take it off, Ill die.**

Mona, Cheng, and Clint stared at each other, but I wasnt certain it was the truth. Why would you agree to something like that? Or are you enslaved?

**Our actions are our own. Our identities must remain secret at all costs.**

I reached forward. The man recoiled. I couldnt tell if it was real or a gambit, but that was the beauty of it: we couldnt risk testing it. We were stopped from figuring out who this person was by nothing more than a statement. If it *was* a lie, which it probably was, then the leaders of the Grey Riders had obviously crafted it and instructed their soldiers to repeat it. Whether or not we believed it, the gambit worked. Bastards.

There was still a chance for some info. Mona, take his blood or something.

I think I can manage that.

**No.**

You dont have a choice, I told him. And well keep your identity secret if it turns out theres a good reason.

That gave our captive pause. He said nothing while Mona undid his grey jacket to free one arm for drawing blood.

With the frequency given by Lian, I turned to the proper channel and informed the Grey Riders of the situation. We have one of yours held hostage. Looks like, from the uniform One Five One Four Eight. Well trade him for our man. If you refuse, well kill him.

The radio response came after a few seconds. **You wont kill One Five One Four Eight.**

Pulling my handheld radio from my bike, I held it up next to my gunand next to the captives head. I didnt have any way to make that classic movie sound, since my gun didnt cock like that, so I improvised. Tell your friends what Im doing.

I still thought I could hear fear despite the emotionless words. **Hes holding a gun to my face.**

Mona grabbed my arm. Shed figured it out while moving around the captives bulletproof vest and clothing. Ed this Grey Rider is a girl. A teenage girl.

It was then I realized we had no idea what was truly going on.

It was also right around then that the entire storm dissipated under the force of a thunderous wind. Looking around, I could see that we were surrounded by hundreds of Grey Riders riding bikes and driving heavy artillery. The scattered knots littered the plain as far as I could see in any direction. We were in the middle of a legion of enemiesbut none of them were looking at us. 

On the horizon, a bright sphere of light soared forward, backed by tremendous airborne firepower held aloft in strange configurations. A beam sliced past from on far, obliterating a nearby hill, and we broke out of our daze to make a break for our bikes while the Grey Riders began setting up strange technologies which formed instant energy barriers to shield them from direct attack. It was an all-out war, or at least a battle as part of one, between the Grey Riders and Her Glory.

Shed survived! That much made us happybut she was not. Her distant sphere radiated red with anger, and we imagined we could her her roar on the strange titanic wind.

We put our teenage prisoner on her bike and forced her, at gunpoint, to ride with us toward the violet exit portal still some minutes ahead. I didnt know if a prisoner exchange was still possible in the middle of all this mess, but it was our only bargaining chip. Otherwise, Kendrick would die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Final, part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/3zsf3b/the_new_exodus_vanguard_final_part_1/)

A vast fissured landscape full of sulfur, ash, and molten rock ran to a spewing volcano on the opposite horizon. On rolling hills of cooled igneous rock below, a lone figure rode at reckless speed. Above and behind, a behemoth mass sailed through the air in a gravity-born arc.

Staring at the thing, Mona only realized its true shape when it landed. It was a man, or at least a humanoid, perhaps thirty feet tall and employing well-muscled heat-blackened metallic limbs. A cyborg? A robot? It wasnt one of Her Glorys creations. That was for sure. This thing was ugly and inelegant, and swung a tremendous ash-coated halberd down, completely obliterating an obsidian pinnacle as Kendrick raced underneath.

She clutched her handlebars tight and turned to her squadmates. We have to do something.

But what? Clint asked, staring wide-eyed at the leaping and slicing titan.

Edgar tapped his helmet. Kendrick! Mona, Clint, and I are on the ridge. Weve found you.

The answering laugh was bitterly exhausted, but triumphant. I see you. Its good to hear your voice, Ed.

You too. Looks like youve made a new friend, though.

Kendrick swung his bike to the right, avoiding another impact, and sped toward the ridge to the east. This thing was waiting here in this valley, and woke up when I came near. I cant shake it.

Any idea what it wants? Edgar asked. Or weak points?

Kendrick hit the throttle and narrowly avoided the obsidian beast as it landed and swung again. It wants to smash things. Weak points? I think Ive heard its joints crack. That, or the volcanoes around here are about to go off. Loud as hell.

Edgar studied its movements. It looks very old. Alright, we ride down there, do circles around it, confuse it. Make it break an ankle.

Mona nodded solemnly, and Clint followed them both down without protest.

Among the rising clouds of ash, wavering heat, and pools of flowing lava, the three tried to stick to cooler highways of old rock. They could avoid the glowing molten rivers well enough, but it wouldnt do to melt the tires.

The titan stopped leaping after Kendrick as it gazed down from on high and saw that its targets had multiplied. Mona tilted to run a hard and fast circle, and, once assured of the igneous path ahead, she caught as much a glimpse of the thing as she could manage. It did look ancient, and excessively worn away by volcanic acids and heat. Parts of it were thicker than others, usually where the original mechanisms remained, which gave it the appearance of an extremely rotted mechanical obsidian skeleton. Its face, though, was nothing but a mask of pure hatred. Some inner hate-filled forge fueled its unchanging eyes with spitting fire, and it focused that ire on her, preparing to swing its towering halberd.

Edgar passed her at high speed, going the opposite way around the beast and firing his handgun once to attract attention. It turned rapidly, fixating on the new threat. Was he taking advantage of a flaw in the titans programming? If so, Kendrick had the same idea, and a second handgun shot caused the titan to turn rapidly again.

A blasting crack shattered the air, hurting Monas still-tender ears, and the titan began to topple at the waist. Centuries of volcanic heat had done the most damage there, and its upper torso fell backwards, where frail weathered supports had broken under its own weight and torsion. Shaking the ground as it hit, the top of the mechanical monstrosity slid into a roiling pool of lava and began to sink even as it grappled about with gaunt bony hands, grasping in vain for purchase.

Kendrick stopped dead for a moment, watching to make sure the monstrosity was actually melting. Once satisfied, he said, Lets get the hell out of here.

We got lucky that it was so old and weathered by the volcanic activity here. Edgar looked back for one final analysis. It was designed to be able to jump and swing a weapon. That it could do. But turning rapidly, with countless years of acid and heat damagenot so much.

Mona felt a strange surge of pride. Edgar seemed to be taking a more proactive role since his recovery. Had nearly dying shaken him out of his depression?

If that titan had been a challenge suited to his skills, Kendricks burns were a concern suited to hers. Taking refuge in a decently distant caldera, she had him stop his bike in the black sand and sit tall for an examination. Edgar and Clint looked on as she studied his charred clothes and horribly melted skin. Everything about him looked red, black, and raw, like poorly cooked strips of chicken. The very air against his skin *had* to hurt. How did you survive? she asked, unsure what to do for him.

Kendrick would record his answer in his journal that night.

---

I just couldnt do it. *I had her.* But I got there, inside her protection, and she was just a woman. Suddenly, in those fearful blue eyes, trying so hard to seem strong, I saw everything Verene had told us about all over again. We were the mob at her palace door, burning the place down because we didnt understand.

Ive carried this anger with me for so long, I dont even know who Im mad at anymore. Now my outside matches how I feel inside: twisted up and painful. I would turn to my father or my brothers for advice in times like this, but creatures *that are now our allies* slew them all. What do I do with that? Who do I hate? What outlet do I have for this pain? I dont know if I can go on, not while carrying this burden.

But I have to. The people I care about are scattered in the multiverse, alone, and probably afraid. I refuse to let this family end. Not like this. I am so tired of losing things.

And I thought I was dead. I knew unleashing that inner fire would probably roast me alive. It did, really. But lying there on that cold silver floor, still smoldering, I didnt feel a thing. For a moment, the anger was gone.

And she was just a woman, just a person, just a human being put through untold centuries of pain and loneliness. Thats why, after deciding not to hurt her at the last moment, I apologized for intruding into her home. Then I fell, and I just remember Monas hands, Randy saying something against my forehead, and the cold grasp of death.

Of course, it was really the cold grasp of the machines. Edgar couldnt hear at the time, but Mona told me that Her Glory promised to try to heal me. When she later told them that, roughly translated, *my flesh could not be saved*, they took it to mean that I was dead. But she was not a native English speaker, and had been out of contact with humanity for centuries. She didnt realize what they had taken her words to mean, and, what with the betrayal that apparently happened during the talks, there was no time to elaborate.

She couldnt save my flesh, but she *could* complete the work her automated outpost had begun. Theres no risk of tearing my spine out now. I feel strangeI know that I am heavier because of the way my feet sink in soft dirt, but the *world* feels lighter. I had half a mind to try to turn and catch that titans ash halberd with my bare hands. Foolish aspiration, I know, but I feel *good.* And my skin... Ive decided to be alright with how I look. Bald, burned, scarredI dont care. Its a visible testament to the anger I carry within, a memorial to my father and brothers, proof that I will forgive, but never forget.

Maybe Her Glory intended to fix my skin, too. Ill never know. I woke with a jolt, and still in pain. The rumbling had begun somewhere mid-surgery, and the complex biomechanical systems around me whipped me through tunnels rapidly while still finishing the operation. My bike appeared near me, carried by another arm, and we were both basically hurled through a violet rectangle of light as the rumble grew deafening and I came to implicitly understand that something very bad had happened. The portal closed behind meand that was it. I was on my own.

But I had faith. I didnt *see* my squad die, so I refused to believe. I rode. Any direction. It didnt matter. Id find something, someone, some place that could help. And I thought I was done for when that titan woke up and came after me, but there they were. Mona, Edgar, even Clint. Ive thought a lot about what to do with him these past few hours.

---

Putting his journal away in one of the storage bags attached to his bike, Kendrick took his first moment of true calm and used it to run his hands along his charred and torn uniform. Hed just gotten a new one, and then this. It seemed that staying pristine out in the multiverse was an impossible task.

His hand kept moving, reaching his hip, where his handgun remained holstered. Everything felt normal; the nerves in his skin that had been burned to numbness by the flames had quickly been restored by the machines so that his new biomechanical inner workings would be connected properly. Still, he wondered if the experience hadnt changed him in ways other than physical. There was part of him missing; some sliver that had remained hopeful and nave. He drew his gun. No more mistakes. No more losing things, he said to it, softly. He lifted his head to shout. Clint, come over here a second.

Getting up from around the fire, Clint stepped through the chilly jungle night, his manner subdued. He knew.

Studying the gaunt features, thin body, and haunted expression of the smaller man, Kendrick placed his gun between them on the seat of his bike.

The thick mass of leaves overhead shifted quietly with the cool night breezes.

Clint trembled, but did not move. Scant firelight radiated between the trees, just enough to glint from moisture at the base of his eyes.

Finally, Kendrick spoke. Were not going to lose anyone else. He glanced toward the fire, where Edgar sat interfacing with a biomechanical sensor node that jutted up from deep in the ground. That node was the reason they had stopped in this particular location for the night: Her Glorys systems ran throughout these worlds, and what they needed now was information. What did Ed find out?

Six, maybe seven days, Clint responded, his breath shaky.

Kendrick slowly picked up the gun and re-holstered it. So we have less than a week before the systemic broken portals from Her Glorys nexus fade. He sighed. Make a map. Make a route. We cant afford to do this at random anymore. You have to face the fact that you can sense where our people are, and you have to focus that talent to plan a route that finds all of them in six days. *Were not losing anyone else.* He was speaking more to himself than Clint, and facing the fact himself that he may have made a costly mistake in sending the man away. Those thoughts remained private.

Alright, Clint said quietly, realizing that he wasnt about to be shot where he stood. He relaxed, finally, and even began to take visible hope as the implications of that grew clearer in his mind. He was being offered a chance to earn his way back into the family. Yes, uh, sir! He saluted.

Laughing weakly, Kendrick waved him off. Go do your job.

For the first two hours, Edgar and Clint argued over a holographic map of the region that had once been Her Glorys domain. Tiny fractures in violet and white lay upon the map like a glass paperweight that had shattered in the center and radiated out cracks to every extremity; upon these, the two traced potential routes, while Mona studied the biometric data on each reality and guessed at survivability and potential dangers.

Five dots blinked quietly on the map where Clint had estimated the locations of the others based on his inexplicable intuition. Kendrick studied them while the others argued. It was not just a question of time, and not just a traveling salesman problem: some realities were more dangerous than others, and some members of the team were more capable combatants.

Edgar continued arguing for his latest route. We should get Jennifer first.

Clint shook his head. Pixley can handle herself, trust me.

Hes right, Kendrick cut in, his eyes still on the map. Four members here, five dots remaining. Bill Nash was dead. The night felt empty and numb. The others continued debating.

Another hour later, Edgar looked up from his calculations and said the unhappy statement everyone else was thinking: We cant reach them all in time.

Kendrick clenched his fist, crumbling a rock he had been absently turning between his fingers. No.

Look, Edgar said with a sigh, while Clint nodded sadly. These temporary fractures are great. We can get back and forth across Her Glorys domain almost instantlybut only to where the fractures go. We expend the most time riding after people that are farthest from the lines. And when those lines close suddenly someone that was a hundred miles away by fracture will become ten thousand miles away by riding.

Kendrick said it again. No.

We rode for *weeks* and we only got to the *center* of this region, Edgar said, his volume rising. The math doesnt lie. Were going to have to choose someone not to save.

Mona and Clint looked at each other, and then down at the ground. Kendrick guessed that they had both been aware of this for at least a few minutes, and had probably already chosen someone to leave behind. Which squad member had they decided didnt have a useful enough skillset? Or perhaps had ended up in too dangerous a reality? He took a deep breath, fighting a sudden surge of despairing refusal. No.

You cant just say no! Edgar shouted, standing. This is the reality. Youre our captain. You have to make a decision. There are five of our friends out there, and we can only save four!

Run me through it again, Kendrick said flatly.

Theres no time

Just run me through your logic, old friend. His thoughts were already making the same dark evaluations the others had worked through. In the end, with Bill gone, the biggest liability was probably Lian. The other potential choice Carmen had ended up in the worst reality, a veritable world of death. To go there would mean risking everyone for one person.

Two people, he corrected himself. Two people.

Edgar began going through each step of the route logic. Some of our members are moving. Some are not. They may be hurt, trapped, or simply doing the smart thing and waiting for us to find them. With extrapolation, we can see we have to go about four thousand miles to get all of them. If we really, really push it and ride sixteen hours a day, average thirty miles an hourand thats pushing it, toowe can only do about three thousand in six days. No one person is a thousand miles away by themselves, but the entire route changes if we drop one destination. Those that are moving will have moved less, etcetera

Kendrick let a calm wind of determination flow through him. So you have the route.

Yeah, but

Then lets go, he said, moving toward his bike. Right now. Were not losing anyone else.

*We have to choose one to leave behind,* Edgar said, refusing to let the issue be avoided any longer.

No, we dont, Kendrick replied, his face stone grim. Not if we dont sleep.

And thus began the Week of Hell.

---

This is a bad dream. Ive spent four hours staring at a white hair I pulled from my temple. This place speaks to me of Diyu, but it is a hell without awareness. The stone walls are cold, and the winter seeps in, but the pulsing white light outside scours the earth better than any chill. I fear that blinking may drive me mad, in ways that door into some living nightmare, witnessed in the first week of our journey, failed to manage.

Someone once lived here. This ancient cubical space, part of a tan-brick building carved partially into the rock itself, seems to hold a quiet legacy of fear. Symbols have been painted on the walls, most especially around the glassless windows. Did they cower here and watch the life outside shrivel and die? I am slightly higher than the city, and I can see a grand sprawl similarly fashioned from tan rock and bricks. Theyre old, but not violently ruined. Whatever kills out there, by my guess, doesnt damage inorganic materials.

I cannot escape, but I have faith the others will find me. When they do, I must be ready to save them in return. The portal dropped me off within this maze-like structure, or else I would have been killed, too. I know because two others came here with me. They chose to step outside; one before we realized, and one on purpose after giving up hope. Her spirit was already broken before she came here, as it is with many of the Vanguard. I do not blame her, and I hope she is forgiven by whatever gods she believes in.

This is not the first time that I have wondered what it is that keeps our family strong while so many others have simply given up. I do not feel exceptional. I would probably give up, too, if I didnt have a child who will need me in a few months. Wherever Carmen is, I must find her. That begins with enduring here until rescue comes, and using that time to plan against enemies that I am certain are moving even now.

The grey-clad oneswhat is their motive? They stole among us like rats; traitors on a ship of humanity that might have just found land. That yellow-clad woman could have been the answer weve been seeking. There was no destiny or Fate about it: everything we are, and everything she was, pulled us all to that meeting in her throne room. It was inevitable.

And she defeated Death, perhaps the first and only person ever to return. What secrets could she have shared with us? There was a book that played a fated role in the days of the Crushing Fist, and it spoke to souls, so we know that souls are real. But what gods tend to those souls? Where do we go after we die? And why has no one ever returned save Gisela the Yellow?

These thoughts consume me as I stare out the window. My knees rest in small depressions, where I can feel other knees rested long before mine, watching this same scene. It will not end. It will not abate. This world died, and it cannot return. I wonder: did it have a soul, too?

I worried for Kendricks soul when he was taken away, and when we were told he could not be saved. That concern kept me from noticing the grey-clad ones among us. I should have been more attentive.

They were never interested in talking. While we spoke of our troubles to Her Glory, they watched and waited behind their black visors. We followed her, all of usand her sphere of protective light, always perfectly surrounding heron a tour to the undermaze of the Palace, where the world simply chose to stop. Below our grated walkways lay the beating purple Heart of the world. A reactor, she said, unlike any other, fueling a nexus of travel that could unite all the worlds in our relevant regions. I believed her.

I am not good enough with words to do the Heart justice. Consider it a deeper magenta than you have ever seen, a blooming flower in three dimensions, a calm chaos constrained in a glimmering fist of technology. All around it, in concentric spheres, arcing rectangular portals shot round and round at high speeds. Matching ones gaze to it like one might a spinning fan, it was possible to see worlds fantastic, benign, and horrifying. Not only that, she said, but these portals could be projected to elsewhere within reason. It was possible to retrieve humanity and bring it here, if we so wished.

If any of us wished to leaveif we did not trust her, or if we simply needed respitewe were also allowed to go at that time.

Just desire it, she said to us, while Verene translated. And it will appear. Those of you that wish to study my history and realm, have free access to the computers. Learn what you must. I am already studying you in equal measure. Then, we will talk, and we will see if reconciliation is possible. I think that she was more scared of us, in her own confident and quiet way much befitting an Empress, than we were of her. Not that we werent afraid: this woman could obliterate or dominate us in an instant if she so much as thought about it. Whole artificial worlds ran under her command, and she had literally built and ruled our civilization centuries before we were even born. It was not that we werent afraid. We were. It was that she held in her a deep pain that she never let show; a bitter and lonely mistrust that I knew well. She was alone.

Ive been alone. It changes a person. You feel that trust may never come again. There were hundreds of us alongside her, but I hoped to have a chance to speak to her and tell her that trust *does* come again. Trust comes from wonder and awe and having something to lose. Trust comes from the unexpected, and a choice to stand alongside someone even when it makes no sense.

Maybe that was why she even entertained the notion of talking to us. Every member of the Vanguard had come out here *expecting* to die. We had no ties to the human race, no family, no home, and almost no hope of success. The most we sought was a good way to die.

That made us the perfect diplomats. Our mission, our very presence, gave our words weight.

But these portals were not naturally one-way. These were true windows between realities, held open by the might of a demi-goddess. We first noticed something was wrong when the grey-clad ones began dragging piles of things back through on pallets. I knew what they were immediately. I had carried one just like itand thrown it into an infernal door.

Bombs. Nuclear bombs. They were stacks upon stacks of nuclear bombs, brought straight into the Heart of the Yellow Palace. Some were packaged in briefcases, like mine had been, but many were bare cubes of metal plastered with radiation warning symbols.

Of all the pallets I saw, and the stacked cubes of nuclear bombs being pulled through by human-made conveyances and the strength of grey-clad black-helmeted soldiers, I could guess now that there were hundreds. I would even believe a thousand or more; more than one for every surviving Vanguard member down there on the walkways.

I was the first to start firing. Without Kendrick to relay orders, I had to take initiative. The others stood in shock until the grey-clad ones began firing back. Then, the battle was on.

Gisela was immune to the bullets, of course, but she had no way of knowing what was happening. To her credit, she held back, trying to understand if she was being betrayed.

Verene wasted no such time. Her sickle shot down a hundred feet to the walkways controlled by the enemyhow? Where was that jade chain stored?and she swung down expertly. She was among them in moments, slicing and murdering in the service of her mistress. I hesitate to say that violence can be beautiful, but her dance of death was a sight to behold. I will never forget the fountains of blood, scored nearly simultaneously across whole squads. She herself was blurred, moving faster than bullets at times, and then slower at others. I still dont understand it, but Edgar shouted that it was an ability granted by her emerald armor.

And I I felt betrayed. Angry. Who were these men? Why were they doing this? Terror, yes. At any moment, those bombs could go off, and we would be wiped from existence. Did these men not know what was at stake? Or did they simply not believe Her Glory would actually help us?

Some sort of concussive grenade blew Verene off the walkways, and, while she used her sickle to swing back up, the men in grey retreated through a portaland were gone.

Her Glory and her sphere of light floated over the railing and down above the bombs while we ran to assist her in figuring out the situation. Swarming down the walkways, hundreds of us rushed down grated steps and along catwalks. I was just behind Randy, who reached the stacked bombs first. Robotic analysis arms had come down and were scanning multiple pallets, and we knew better than to try to move them. 

Theyre probably set to go off if we move them, one of the captains shouted. Everyone pick one! Well try to disarm them!

Randy flipped open a control panel on one of the outer cubes.

The first number I saw was one, and then seven, followed by rapidly changing digits. The seven became a six.

Sixteen seconds.

The men in grey had planned this to perfection.

Fifteen.

Nobody moved. Nobody spoke. For the longest second of my life, a thousand men and women stopped breathing.

Fourteen.

Jump! someone ordered by radio.

Thirteen.

We were already surrounded by portals in every direction; concentric spheres of them, going to every random place imaginable. It would work. In that moment of crisis and panic, we knew.

I hurtled over the railing at eight seconds, right behind Carmen. Flailing men and women soared down all around me, a rain of desperation. My last sight of the Heart, looking up, was Gisela the Yellow holding a hand to her chest. Floating in here sphere of light, she watched humanity abandon her yet again, seemingly after a vicious backdoor betrayal.

Or did she feel betrayed? Did she guess that some other agency had performed this backstabbing? I think she did, for hundreds of mechanical arms working in blurred rapid concert deposited our motorcycles after us. In less than ten seconds, she sent us off with everything we had arrived with, saving us from certain death simply through being stranded.

The portal closed behind meand likely everyone elseas stars flared beyond. The bombs had gone off all at once, right in her Heart.

Id survived, along with two other soldiers who I did not recognize. Carmen was not with me. And now I am alone again

---

To Cheng Yao, what felt like an eternity in blinking deathly silence was actually only about a day and a half. He was the first along the route, and the first place where his four oncoming squadmates might have met their death, had they not come prepared. Whatever the blinking celestial object overhead was, it seemed to be in distant geosynchronous orbit, so true night never fell. The saving grace was that only direct light was fatal. Cheng had observed this, seeing his own survival indoors and the survival of pieces of his comrades under their uniforms, and Mona had guessed this from the sensor data theyd used to create their map.

It was as simple as wearing their helmets and carefully tying up all exposed skin. Kendrick, in his torn and charred uniform, stayed behind while Edgar and Mona ventured in. Clint, too, remained behind. He was, as Kendrick said, too valuable to risk in this manner.

They would have survived even if they had not known beforehand, for Cheng sat in his ancient brick dwelling and continually radioed warning. It was a simple enough plan, but effective: for hours upon hours, he simply repeated his words about the danger, never pausing for a second lest someone enter his reality and die instantly.

He began laughing when he saw them coming up the ridge, and then crying when the two had entered the dwelling and he could clasp them and see that they were real and alive. When everything exploded, I thought you all

Edgar nodded sadly. Yeah.

Mona gripped each of their hands. Lets go. Kendrick and Clint are waiting.

Cheng held back, suddenly aghast. What? Clint?

Yeah, Mona asked, confused. Why, whats up?

Cheng seemed about to say something, but, then, instead made a statement. Take me to him.

They wrapped Cheng up tightly and headed together toward the unstable rectangular fracture that had allowed them access. They passed through an alley between two weathered buildings, just out of sight of Chengs former hideout, and into a warm windswept heath.

Kendrick and Clint stood behind a small hill, waiting.

Cheng stalked forward, suddenly murderous. Ive had enough betrayal!

Clint took a step back, eyes wide, but Kendrick blocked him. Were not losing any more people. Not for *any* reason.

It was enough of a confrontation that Edgar and Mona had to be told something. While Cheng clenched his fists and turned away, Kendrick gave them a general outline of what he knew.

Neither said a word. Edgars silence seemed born of distrust and wariness. Mona said nothing because she, more than anything, just seemed morally disappointed.

Clint stood aside from the group, once more drawn and hesitant.

Come on, Kendrick said to all of them. Back on the bikes. We cant delay. Mona, how long until we need stimulants to stay awake?

As soon as people start to feel tired, Id say, she replied, climbing on her bike and donning her helmet with a grim glance at Clint. We cant afford for anyone to tumble and get hurt at high speed.

Whats going on? Cheng asked, getting ready before even being told.

Kendrick stated his intent completely seriously. Were going to ride about thirty-eight-hundred miles in six days. No sleep, the whole way in one shot, so that we can save every member of our family.

His tension with Clint put aside for the sake of the mission, Cheng nodded with determination. Staying awake for six days? Fitting. He gave a small laugh about something, and then shook his head against the thought. I wont let you down. Not this time.

The two gripped forearms for a moment. Kendrick turned to Mona and Edgar. Whos next?

Edgar studied his written notes and glanced to Clint for confirmation. Lian.

What kind of world?

Four-legged upright insects about the size of a human, Mona reported, leafing through the pages of her journal from the night before. Indigenous civilization, low-level technology, not inherently hostile by the reports, at least not at the time of these readings.

Lets hope thats still true, Kendrick muttered, booting his kickstand and heading forward.

They rode on. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not much is known about Clint C.J. Alvarez, not even what his nickname stands for. Without a recovered journal, all that is left of his role in the Retreat Front is a patchwork of mentions by the people who knew him. Even then, aside from the initial half-week of training, the team only had him eight daysseven of which were known as the infamous Week of Hellbefore he was taken from them in a manner so brutal that Kendrick the Scarred would still grow angry at its mere mention even years later.

Kendricks team, scattered as they were at the time, had no idea that the Retreat Front was in full swing. So named for its directionthe only direction that mattered, directly away from the vast canyon of darkness left scored into the multiverse by the Devastationthe Retreat Front became the most successful hemisphere for exodus. Those that had been sent laterally, as compared to the Void, escaped in lesser numbers. Those sent toward and around the Void never made it to safety before the cold caught up to them, with only one exception.

More than that, those survivors moving through the Retreat Front were initially extremely lucky. Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind had fled dozens of realities distant into the multiverse nearly a thousand years before, and it was out there that she had carved her new realm; a second realm for a second exile, a realm devoid of sentient life and exotic dangers, and a realm lonely by choice. Of course, we know the Devastations chaotic scrambling of reality positions brought her into unwanted contact with Yngtak, several secretly surviving Amber Worlds, and the refugees of the New Exodus, but few among the Vanguard fully understood what was happening when she began to wake from the death that had found her during the initial catastrophe.

Edgar Braces journal on this topic read:

---

Clint has found us, and all three of us are much worse for the wear, but he seems to feel that Kendrick is still alive. Ive got a modified transmorphic sphere in my stomach, but I can ride. Were going to find him.

I dont know the state of things out there, but the events of the last day or two probably need to be pieced together, if possible.

I swear I saw Kendrick burned alivebut anythings possible out here, and I want his survival to be true. I hate to admit this, but my oldest friends presence would make me feel much safer right now.

The massed forces of the alliance began the attack with nuclear weapons. Her Glorys swarms of transmorphic spheres rose up; automatic defenses employed by crude artificial intelligence while she was incapacitated. It was easy to outsmart, but her forces were incredible in numbers and capabilities. Shed spent the last seven or eight centuries building up unbreakable defenses to keep anyone from violating her bitter exile. Wed bypassed almost all of them due to the randomization of reality positionsone wall world did get half of Kendrickbut her core heartworld still had its tricks.

Im no poet, but I hope someone among the Vanguard is, and can record the incredible bravery of the Yngtak people. Theyd just found out that their homeworld remained intact, but they chose to stay and fight with us, risking everything for the sake of the pact they had made with our people against Her Glorys waking. Their legions of energy lances protected those on foot, on bikes, and in tanks long enough for us to get inside.

And the amethyst pyramids, Jesus Christ. I hope theyre not sentient, because, if they are, they paid a terrible price in blood. Gooey purple ionized crystalline solution blood that stains and stinks and takes forever to get out of clothes, admittedly, but a terrible price anyway. They couldnt shoot projectilesthe sapphire rifles were our invention. They didnt have the terrifying destructive powers of the ruby cubes, either; just one of those, as the rumors among the squads told it, would have granted Her Glory a first-class ticket to hell, and all of us along with her for good measure.

No, all the amethyst pyramids could do was slam into things with their massive bodies and then disappear in a perfect sphere of annihilation. I knew what it was when I saw it, and I think Randy did, too: an unspecified teleport. Everything in that massive radius simply ceased to exist, molecularly separated and sent to nowhere by what was effectively a portal with no destination.

They were, by their very nature, suicide bombers.

It was no wonder the Gemstone Hegemony chose their battles carefully. They wielded awesome power, but at a horrible cost. Everyone out in the nearby realms of the multiverse knew of the always-evolving army of nightmares in Her Glorys walled-off sphere of influence, and this was theirourchance. Even the Plant God was there, bringing genetically engineered lumbering titans to spray anti-toxins and bash their way through the ground-based cyborgs. Under their canopies, we rode.

Under their canopies, we rode toward that gigantic Shielded mountain; under the Yngtaks cover fire, we went for it; through a temporary hole in the Shield made by sacrificed amethyst pyramids, we made it inside. Only those on bikes were fast enough, but that included a large number of Vanguard squads. Hundreds, maybe even a few thousand men and women. It wasnt clear what we could even manage to do, but Verene was with us, and she led the way into the foot of one of the massive arching pillars that supported the mountainous base high above.

But that was the funny thingthat base above was entirely a Shield generator. We went *down* instead, through a labyrinth of mechanical tubes not meant for travel, yet still wide enough for the squads to flow through them like invading bacteria in a blood vessel. Many of us slowed to destroy random mechanisms, but Verene warned us that we were, in doing so, more or less stabbing a continent with a sewing needle.

Onward we rode, down spiraling passages and along high tubes and through massive cathedrals built solely for the religion of biomachinery. We saw factory floors far below, full of captured animal life being converted. Some sectors held tubes growing new creatures; so not all were from surrounding realities. But was all this purely from the mind of one woman? Were all these factories and labs and experiments her lifes work in exile?

It was, and they were.

We were five or six hours in, and miles deep, when we came to the heart of her world. 

Within a smooth chrome spherical space of a size beyond description, there sat two buildings. One was a replica of the Palace of the Holy Roman Empress, detailed in elaborate gold trim and long yellow traceries. The other was a tan-walled and brown-trimmed manor of ancient German design that looked, in comparison, small and pathetic. I remember what was said.

Her first home, Verene told us, unprompted.

Is she in the palace? Kendrick asked.

Verene shook her head. Shell be in the house, in her old bedroom. Power and ostentation sickens her, now.

I saw it in my friend. A world full of horrific cyborgs and growing spiked columns was one thing, but something about invading a womans home while she slept made Kendrick visibly uneasy.

That all changed when the final defenses activated. We shouldnt have let our guard down, but there wasnt much we could have done in any case.

The artificial intelligence in charge of the defenses wasnt very smart. Even with eight hundred years progress, it was nowhere even close to the human brain command nodes Her Glory had built with the sacrifice of volunteers centuries before. Still, it had an immense variety of tools at its disposal. Although it just sent one of the new variant, one was enough.

Wed annihilated countless biomechanically augmented creatures on the way down already. They ranged from small to fearsome, but were all themselves limited by the cramped spaces beneath the earth. This one, coming by itself, seemed laughable. One of the other squads shot the cyborg bear the instant it popped out from a chrome cave. It fell dead and lay there.

And then, while we all looked for new dangers, it began to glow.

None of us expected danger from a dead thing, and perhaps that was what the intelligence had been counting on. It exploded five seconds later. The blast wave of shrapnel and vindictive blue fire tore dozens into chunks and evaporated them into fine mist before they even had a chance to scream.

It was genius in its simplicity. We now had to pause and keep our attention on every kill for at least five seconds. That was an unthinkable cost in time and thought while in a battle situation, let alone the coordination cost inherent in scattering people away from a corpse that was about to explode. Only one in a hundred of the creatures swarming at us from the Yellow Palace was a delayed blast variant, but one in a hundred was enough.

Youre sure shes in the house? a forward squad Captain shouted to Verene over the radio. The hundreds of the Vanguard were now a line across the circular bottom of the gigantic chrome sphere, and advancingbut our ammunition was limited, and we only had one shot.

Shes near waking, Verene radioed back. Minutes. You can no longer trust what I tell you.

The squad captains began talking on a private channel, and, ultimately, they chose to use our scant mortars on the house while we fought toward the Yellow Palaceboth answers. While we fought to hold back endless hordes of half-metal bears, tigers, elephants, strange flying things, tentacled creatures, and exotic beings wed never seen before, several squads set up the mortars.

The house had no defenses. The rubble revealed that Verene had spoken truly.

Within a devastated array of bricks, glass, and dust, a white sphere of light surrounded an unharmed old German bed. Designed for a little girl, it was almost too small for the woman herself, who lay with her eyes closed and her hands folded over a simple pale yellow dress whose tone exactly matched her hair. Her skin was pure white, like Verenes, but her hair was bright blonde, and it occurred to me that Verene might have already had white hair through natural aging when she was immortalized by whatever process had turned her skin ivory

Mortars exploded against the surrounding light, and failed to so much as rustle her spread blonde hair.

One of the captains screamed, What is that sphere?

Verenes answer was chilling. I dont know. Ive never seen it.

The spherebed and allbegan to rise into the air.

Shes waking, Verene radioed. The process is near completion. She will rise to the apparatus at the top of this enclosure, and then her resurrection will be complete.

Looking up, we could barely see some sort of receptacle high at the pinnacle of the arching chrome sky above.

I think it was Kendrick that called for the action, but we were all already thinking it. Making it to the ruins of the house and taking cover among the boulders of rubble, the outer soldiers protected us while the inner hundredsour entire squad includedtested the sphere.

The initial shots didnt penetrate, but each flaring response from the light did stop its ascent. It seemed that resisting bullets used enough energy to keep it in place. I think, all told, about seven hundred of us were in that rubble and aiming at that sphere. At collective orders, we all opened fire.

The noise was incredible, and those of us who didnt already have our helmets on donned them just to avoid going deaf. Seven hundred automatic weapons firing constantly produce a sound and a fury that cannot be conveyed in wordsand we were certainly furious. Closing in, many of us fired from inches away, screaming.

I felt it, too. I screamed in anger, too; anger at the pains wed endured, anger at being drawn here instead of being allowed to continue into the multiverse, and anger at things Her Glory had nothing to do with, like Rachels death, the Devastation, and everything I had never accomplished in my life.

Keep firing! Kendrick roared over the radio, and we ringed that sphere and hammered it with everything we had. Every impact sent a ripple across the surface, and our collective rage created a mad dance of chaotic light. Ever so slowly, as thick smoke and the smell of gunpowder washed over us from the sheer number of firing weapons, the protective sphere began to descend.

A slight flare of white shot in from the left, some invisible energy made tangible by strain, and Randy realized it first. Her Glory had already misdirected us once in exactly the same manner. She screamed into the radio in her helmet just to be heard over the roar. This Shieldits being generated by something in the Palace!

The crashing waves of cybernetic organisms began splashing up over the outer rocks of our defended ruins, and I remember reloading and seeing only two clips left after the current one. The others had to be in a similar situation, and I saw the realizationthrough the visor of her helmeton Monas face. This couldnt last.

The captains had a choice. They could try to send some of us into the morass of death to try to reach the Palace and shut down the generator, or they could to use our last mortars to score a lucky hit from afar. I was thinking through both of these options as our time began running out.

They chose a third option: aim the mortars at the sphere, and order us to fire even closer and faster.

Id never been more seized by adrenaline. The cacophonous roar of hundreds of automatic weapons had been loud before, but now it was deafening even through my helmet, but I kept stepping forward with the others. Just ten feet away, I could see Her Glorys calm and deathly face as she laid in peace. Could she even hear us in there? Losing even more height, the sphere began displacing rubble beneath it.

The mortars impacted terrifyingly close, their smoke and fire jutting instantly from the top and sides of the hard light, but we couldnt back off now. Each impact shot the light through with greater ripples, and, at each impact point, ethereal white briefly flickered orange.

Something is happening! I heard Randy report. The mortar explosions cause a different reaction! Kendrick passed her realization to the other captains.

That clinched it. As nightmares began pouring over our outer defensive line, the mortar teams turned and fired everything they had at the invincible dead woman. Waves of force and intense heat battered Mona and I, but we stood strong, and kept firing. I stopped hearing anything but a high whine.

Someone tall came up from behindId seen him on the ride down, one of oursand swung a sapphire rifle from over his back. He didnt have a helmet on, and his strong-jawed face was dripping with blood, but he seemed absolutely determined. I could tell our entire side of the circle, still firing their red-hot weapons, held hearts seething with furious support for his coming action. The dodecahedron impacted the sphere with a strange implosive force, and the entire curved surface briefly turned deep blue.

Something tore through the corner of my jacket, and I saw a few men fall.

Our bullets had gone through the shield.

It was failing.

---

Edgar couldnt hear anything, but Monas ears had avoided the same level of damage by luck, and she later wrote this:

---

I thought for a moment that Edgar had been hit, but he'd just been grazed.

Someone ordered us to fire lower, but wed all already anticipated that and begun firing directly at the pale woman in her bed. I saw Randy move up to grip Kendrick on the shoulder, and I heard her radio from inside her helmet: Its not that its failing. I think it can only anticipate and nullify two types of assault at once. It has an extremely fast response time, like the computers that did speed surgery on you, so the attacks have to be simultaneous.

Kendrick turned to organize the firing of the sapphire rifle, mortars, and bullets at the same time.

He was too late.

The incredible noise slowed and stopped, bringing a crushing sensation of despair across us all. I saw Edgar keep clicking his trigger, unwilling to accept that he was out of ammo. 

The hail-like pattern on the sphere ceased, and it began rising again.

As fast as they could, the captains assembled a gun that still had a few bullets, our last mortar, and the sapphire rifle. Those behind us were being taken by the swarms even then, but there was still a chance. I regretted being there with every bit of my soulif only that helicopter had never flown over us at the last moment, Edgar and I would have actually left, and been far away from that death pit!but I understood this had to be done. We didnt look behind us at the coming bloodbath. We just watched the three men and their three weapons.

Simultaneously, they fired.

The sphere tried to flicker blue, orange, and white all at once, and the explosion masked the result for many crucial seconds; I felt mechanical arms clamping onto me from behind even as the sight finally became clear: of the three, it was the bullets that had gotten through. Holes had been torn in the wood of Her bed, parts of the mattress, the alabaster pillow beneath her head and pale white blood oozed from a deep nick in her shoulder.

It hadnt been enough.

I remember being lifted up and away. Edgar tried to fight off whatever it was that had me, but a long claw descended from above and came for him, too. It was a claw like the one that had replaced half of Kendrick, sourced from the vast outer sphere of chrome; we were still inside a machine, after all. The claws had waited until we were out of mortars to descend.

The scene below was horrible; almost as bad as the battlefield on the surface Id drag Edgar across later. Hundreds of bikes lay scattered among tens of thousands of dead half-metal animals. Strange bloods of various colors pooled all over, but none were red. The humans had not been killed: we were being taken. The last thing I saw before being pulled into the steel and glass bowels of Her underworld was the sphere of light rising toward the chrome sky.

Darkness and light of various colors flashed by as I was pulled rapidly through tunnels at a breakneck speed. I was vaguely aware of other people thrashing about me; I called out for Edgar on the radio in my helmet, but he didnt respond. Was he dead? Was I about to die?

But the claws werent killing us, at least not immediately. I came to a halt after being clamped with something new, something that felt like the restraints on a rollercoaster. Metal bars came down from above to hold my shoulders, waist, and legs in place. Looking around in shock, I could see other Vanguard members similarly restrained in some sort of upright line of captives. Shoulder to shoulder, desperately looking left and right, we hung.

An assembly line. Thats what it felt like. We were in trouble.

Whos up ahead? someone asked over the radio.

Im in front, a woman answered, cutting in over the shouts of confusion. Theres something horrible here, right next to me. Saws, knives, bio stuff. The hell with thisIm out.

Someone else screamed for her to stop, but I saw a purple flash maybe forty slots down the line.

God, shed done itthose in charge had distributed small amethyst suicide pyramids to everyone back when wed first stumbled upon this whole situation. I knew they worked, because of Edgars stories. That womanshed used hers.

The line of captives slid forward one notch. The jerk scared me out of my panic. Edgar! Guys!

Im up here, Bill Nash responded first, breathing hard, his voice full of unhappy anticipation. Im fourth from the front. Well, third now. God. Damnit.

Mona? Randy radioed. Mona, what do you see in your position? We have to figure out a way out of this!

Given some direction to work with, I fought down the heady blur of fear and started actually looking around. We seemed to be in some sort of long cramped back metal alleyway with no floor. Machinery and electronics abounded, but, directly below, there was only darkness. Above, thick rods held us to a rail. As I took this in, my initial comparison to some sort of strange rollercoaster felt more and more apt. Nothing, Randy. I dont see anything useful.

I heard Lians voicetired, as if she was wounded, or exhausted. Bill, are you alright?

Another scream of refusal and a purple flash erupted from ahead. The line jerked forward another position, and shouts of anger and terror echoed even through my helmet.

To my left, I saw movement, and I heard Kendrick muttering something furious. Two notches over, I could see him begin to strain against his restraints with his right arm. I remember a surge of hope in that moment, realizing that he could actually *do* something. We all whooped as he screamed in determined pain and actually began to push his restraining bars out.

No! Randy shouted. Kendrick, no!

He didnt stop. I could see his muscles straining under the relatively new jacket he had picked up back at one of the bases. I knew he had anger issues, but this might have been the perfect time for them, if it fueled him enough to break himself and others out.

Randy kept talking. Remember what the doctor said! Youll rip your spine out!

He didnt listen. The bars squealed under the strain.

Save it! Randy screamed, holding back tears. This isnt the time! We cant get out of these right now, theres nowhere to go! Just wait for an opportunity!

The squealing stopped. Kendrick slowly let loose his grip and let his arm hang. His voice was full of barely restrained hate. Ill wait. But if I see a chance to strangle Her

Go for it, Randy choked out, relieved.

Another purple flash came from the right, and we jerked forward again.

Aw Christ, Bill radioed, now first in line by my math. Theres some serious shit here, guys. This machine is absolutely going to do horrible things to usto mewhen the line starts moving.

It was Lians turn to insist against rash action. Her strangely calm voice cut through our fear. Dont do it, Bill.

Im sorry Lian, he replied, far more emotional than she. Aw fuck. Damnit. God *damnit.* Oh hell, if you could see the shit up hereno, Ive put up with so much crap, but I cant. I cant become one of those things.

We dont know whats happening, Lian continued, powerfully calm despite the exhaustion in her voice. The radio chatter from the other squads went silent as we all listened, taking hope from her steadiness. The assembly line hasnt actually converted any of us yet, and weve seen no converted humanoids so far. We dont know the situation.

Shes right, Jennifer Pixley murmured, supporting her. This is bad, I know. It seems our numbers are up. But weve seen a lot of bad that turned out to be something else. Just stay with us.

Okay, okay, okay, Bill replied, huffing desperately.

It was my turn to add to the conversation. Bill, you have to control your breathing. Youre going to hyperventilate.

Okay okay, he continued, trying to breathe more slowly. Okay. After a moment, he said: I shoulda stayed home and gone back to farming.

Well do that, Lian said, even managing a hint of genuine human reassurance. Well go, Bill. Well find somewhere and well start a farm somewhere warm, with nobody else around, and

The bearing-born rods above us all shifted over an inch, as if preparing for motion, and Bill shouted in sudden crisis. I couldnt help it. I screamed along with the rest of the squad as the inevitable purple flash followed.

The moment of calm broken, the radio surged with terrified chatter and shouts all over again. Through it all, I could hear Lian sobbing. It sounded real, like any human suffering, and wholly unlike the product of a monster that lacked feelings. Shed found something out herebut it had been taken away from her.

Lian, dont! I heard Jennifer yell. Somewhere down the line, they were next to each other. I already knew what Lian was doing: rolling the suicide amethyst in her pocket between her fingers.

Let her make her choice, Carmen cut in, her signal sounding weak and distant. Her voice ran deep with sorrow. When you lose something precious, you have to make the decision to keep going on your own. Others can keep you from the unthinkable for awhile, but just for awhile. Its always up to you, in the end.

Yes, Cheng added, agreeing with her. It is. And that decision destroys you, or pushes you on to a new life. Lian, there is more ahead of us. Have faith in that. You can be completely alone one day, and suddenly surrounded by family the next.

Lians sob-filled breathing was still audible amidst the chatter from the other squads.

Wait, Randy realized for us. The line didnt move forward a notch.

Bill? Kendrick called, speaking first with the hope we all shared.

Bill?!

Bill!

*Bill!*

But the line hadnt failed to move forward because Bill was still alive. It had failed to move forward because it had switched over to a different track once all of us had been captured. We slowly realized the terrible truth as a wide bay door rolled open and we began sliding around a previously unseen curve in the rail above. We were being taken somewhere.

And Bill was dead.

All that way wed gone all that way without a death. The odds had run out, and something felt broken in me now that it had finally happened. Had I actually had faith before? Edgar had once told me that we were all already dead, and I hadnt really disagreed with him, but I suddenly felt empty. That meant that I must have had faith before, and lost it with Bills suicide.

Our strange sideways rollercoaster zoomed us along through another maze of randomly lit tunnels, threatening to make me vomit, but it finally shot us out into open air before the nausea became too strong. The track hit a turn, and began arcing us around in a vast circle. Suddenly, I could see hundreds of other Vanguard soldiers, all trapped just like us. We came to a stop once the circle was completeour entire legion, encircled around a vast silver dais, atop which sat Her Glorys glowing sphere and protected bed. She remained lying on it, but the growing lights in the darkness above hinted that would soon change.

Verene stood beside her bed, but outside the light.

Had we been betrayed?

No. The emerald-clad woman held a jade sickle that seemed to originate within her hand. She did not speak, but her mannereven for one who was deadspoke volumes about the consequences of certain choices in the next few minutes.

The rising lights revealed that we were inside the palatial Throne Room of the Yellow Palace. The entire circular restraint apparatus fit within, and then some; intricate yellow tapestries adorned high pillars. Some of them even looked ancient and weathered. Had Her Glory taken them with her in her flight all those years ago?

A groan echoed in the air, and we all fell silent.

Slowlyweaklythe blonde woman in the bed began to stir.

She was alive.

Sitting up and turning with drawn-out feebleness, she slung her bare ivory feet over the edge of the bed, tugged her pale yellow dress down to her ankles, and pushed painfully up onto her feet.

She didnt look at us. Not even once. Rather, she was like someone who had just woken up, and, in zombie-like fashion, desperately needed a coffee. The sphere of light followed her perfectly as she moved. Shuffling across her dais with bleary eyes, she sighed tiredly, lifted her hand, and summoned up a technological node from beneath. The small pillar shot up, beeped happily, and expanded a sudden panorama of holographic screens, interfaces, and information.

Groaning, sighing, and even *burping* once, she squinted against the bright wash of the lights from above and studied her screens.

One of them looked like a three-dimensional map whose parts I had seen separately before. A damaged sphere of realitiesmany red, some missing completelylooked like home. Directly beside it, an incredible black gulf, like a Grand Canyon cut across the fabric of existence, shot from thickness to a distant point somewhere unthinkably far beyond our reach. And there, far from the First World Empire, but still pathetically close for all the distance we had ridden, was another jumbled sphere of influence: Her former domain, scrambled beyond recognition.

It suddenly made sense. Her realm had been slightly further from the Devastation, but shed had no civilization-wide Shield to protect her. That had been built, the way Verene had told it, with the combined greatest minds of two powerful civilizations. Even with her incredible intellect and awesome abilities, she had only managed pale imitations. Besides that, I wondered, in those quiet moments of tension, if she could have built a true Shield even if she'd had the tech. Hadnt it required the sacrifice of a number of human and brownshirt lives? Some had become brain nodes, some had become integral artificial intelligences but Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind was alone out here in her exile. She had no one willing to make that sacrifice for her, at least not anymore. Everyone she had loved, and who had loved her, had died a very long time ago.

When her chin fell slightly, I understood. As foreign as her mind and existence were to me, and for all the horrors her machines had put us throughI felt sorry for her.

But our silence had not been completely self-imposed. The air felt heavy, and I realized I couldnt hear my own breathing. That silence, perhaps intended to enforce reverence, became a liability for its creator.

I didnt hear a thing, but Kendrick had forced his way out of his restraints while Her back had been turned. His helmet lay thrown on the silver floor, and I saw the fury in his eyes. He had the needed information, the needed willcould he do it?

Verene made no move to stop him. She wouldnt have, of course. She was dead.

Or at least, mostly dead. I found that very curious. The revival of Her Glory, or perhaps the retrieval of old memories, had instilled a subtle new sense of purpose that I believed even Verene didnt know she now held. Her hand gripped her sickle tighter, but she did not stop Kendrick.

His knifeone form of attack, piercingand his raised fistbludgeon force*could he actually do it?* What was his third weapon?

The circle of hundreds of trapped soldiers stayed deadly still. We all felt hope, but nobody wanted to give away what was happening. In her resurrection fuzziness, Her Glory didnt sense him coming.

He planted his right foot against the silver floor, thrust the knife against the sphere with his left handit didnt have to be strong, just simultaneousand punched the now slightly yellowed light with his right fist, bearing down on it with all the might his cybernetic half could offer.

The light flickered between white and pale yellow, and the perfect arc of the sphere, which had never once wavered, bent slightly inward. Just how strong *were* that arm and leg? Hed positioned himself perfectly to avoid using his spine, and he roared silently with all the rage he had to offer.

I realized what he was about, in that moment. He was going for a suicide assault, just like the massive amethyst pyramids. Hed already burned himself once when hed let his anger go too far, what with those dangerous molecules still inside him from the spices wed all accidentally eaten on an otherwise innocuous world, but this time he had found focus for everything that had been done to him, done to us, and done to humanity. This was a target he could hate with all the intensity of a burning star of rage.

The flames burst forth all across his skin, answering his anger with heat, and the sphere adapted orange against the fire.

He burst forth, leaving his knife and much of the flames behind. This time, the attack that had passed through was the one hed hoped for: the bludgeon, the punch, the man himself. He was in.

Her Glory turned, finally waking from her half-dazed stupor. Within that sphere of light, compared to the massive former farmhand, she looked like a slip of a woman about to be destroyed. She had her childhood home here, recreated. She lived alone. She hadnt purposely converted any humanoidsat least not yet. Even with my heart leaping for Kendrick to succeed, I wasnt sure I wanted him to.

She didnt flinch. She stared him dead on with surprisingly normal blue eyes. Even for the equivalent of a goddess, I was impressed. A large and tremendously strong *flaming man* had her dead to rights, and she only took a breath and waited for the inevitable.

Could she even be harmed? Would she just resurrect all over again? We would never know.

Kendrick stopped his burning fist inches away from her face, and then fell to his knees. He said something then, to her, but I couldnt see his lips past the flames to guess what it was.

He fell to the side, still smoldering.

For all her confidence, Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankindreally just Gisela, a girl who had never been able to hold on to anything she lovedlet out a nervous held breath, staggered back with relief, and clutched her hand to her chest.

The sudden heavy blanket of silence lifted, but none of our hundreds dared speak. Gisela looked to Verene in askance.

Her age-old protector responded to the unspoken question. Certain unknowns had to be made known, Verene told her. Now you know that they act out of fear against your mechanisms, but, when it comes down to it, they dont truly want to harm you. She turned to the captive audience. And you should all know that she could have killed Kendrick Merrill at any moment. Half of him belongs to her, under the skin. She didnt, not even instinctively, not even in the moment, not even in self-defense. She turned back to her Empress. I think

Gisela asked her something involving the word *zunten*; amazed, not mortified.

---

This was not completely correct. Later it would be reconstructed, from eye-witness accounts, that the Machine Empress asked Verene a question in Old High German, which more or less translated to: How have you regained your inner light?a question whose answer would have tremendous ramifications in the years to come.

---

I *think*, Verene continued with emphasis, avoiding the question. That you all have a great deal to talk about. You should release them, sit with them, and, perhaps, tell each other your tales. These are your people, centuries hence, and they come to you in a time of need.

Gisela looked back to her screens, specifically, the map of the Devastation, and the damage that extended off of her known charts. Sehan... (Or see-han, or say-han, Im not sure). But it sounded like she understood, and her face was grim and full of pained disbelief.

The bars suddenly lifted on all of us at once, and several hundred soldiers of the Vanguard found themselves removing their helmets, rubbing their ears, and looking at each other in wonder. Some of us, Randy especially, quickly realized what Her Glorys help might mean for our survivalnot just us, but the entire human race. She could not only feed everyone, given time, she could even help rebuild, the way she had first built the Empire out of love so long ago.

There were several hundred soldiers there but we were not all Vanguard. Our uniforms had never been perfect, thrown together at the last minute as they had been, so we thought nothing of the grey-clad men among us. Nor did anyone notice that they kept their helmets on. Wed grown accustomed to wearing them in many situations, and not everyone had taken theirs off, so nobody questioned it as the talks began.

We should have. Somebody should have noticed. In our relief, we let our guard down, and we paid dearly for it.

---

Putting aside her journal, Mona leapt to her feet.

Hes close! Clint yelled. I figured out why it feels weird. Kendrick is on the move!

Leaping onto her bike, Mona followed Edgar and Clint over the next ridge, where the most beautiful ugly sight shed ever seen awaited her: a burned and disfigured former farmhand who had somehow survived bursting into flamenow fighting for his life a second time against a strange enemy.

	<TEXT> The other answers are right, but I'll add a little bit.

I like the nature of the multiverse. It allows for new stories to happen without conflicting with older stories. Different Earths, different situationsvery similar worlds that are just extremely far apart in the multiverse. There's always a chance they could interact, but they don't have to. And it's never certain which one is 'our' world, the one we're all sitting in reading stories together.

There is an existing connection which I don't think anyone is aware of yet; certain seemingly unrelated stories that actually take place in the same world. We're about to come up on that very hard.

I'm also working on a continuation of Psychosis and The Asylum. It was briefly going to be the story for a video game currently being produced, but the medium wasn't right, so it'll be written stories (and someone very talented is working on a film). So, if you liked those, you'll be in for a treat :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I hate New Years Eve. Every year on this night, the anomaly comes back. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-01 00:28:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It first appeared in the sewers of my hometown five years ago. The only hints we had of its existence were two dismembered teenagers and one young girl who had been traumatized into permanent silence. At the time, disturbing as the event was, it was hard for the police to justify spending resources on kids that had been deemed undesirables. The questions focused on what the three had been doing in the sewers on New Years Eve, not on who or what had killed the two boys, and the terrified mute girl couldnt answer them in either case. We didnt have much to do in my town other than drink, so our debates at the bar went in circles before fading over the next few months.

We were collectively just about to forget about the whole thing when the next New Years Eve rolled around. The nights celebrations were rowdy, sure, but slightly overshadowed. More than a few people had theorized there might be a serial killer who had chosen that night, annually, for his ritual. We all kept a nervous eye on the shadowed distances outside the reach of streetlamps and porch lights.

Just after midnight, screams echoed out from a back lot behind the old hardware store. A tremendous burst of drunk, angry, and protective men surged from the Main Street bars, myself among them. Wed amped up all night to potentially mass mob a serial killer, but none of us were prepared for what we saw.

Four limbs, a torso, and a head lay scattered around the lotbut not in even pieces. Some tremendous force had sliced them to bits. Worse, the same mute girl from the year before sat huddled behind a dumpster, crying and covered in a sopping wave of blood.

Harold, our oldest homeless man, had been murdered, and that girl had become the primary suspect.

The police took her and brutally interrogated her. Our town was simultaneously silent and full of whispered gossip the entire time. Nobody knew whether to feel bad for her or whether to demand she be treated more fairly. If she *had* killed those people that way, she was totally insane, so I fought down my usual urge toward fairness, and stood by while they continued hurting her. We all did.

Apparently, after four days, she finally cracked and told them what she had seen both New Years Eves. We could only guess at this, though, because the chief of police left the station with a haggard look of suspicion and fear and without a word. The other cops escorted the girl to the psych ward of our local hospital and left her there indefinitely.

They looked for a hypothesized serial killer for a few months, but neither scene held any forensic evidence. They were forced to give up.

Not that it mattered. The next New Years Eve, they were all killed just after midnight. A veritable cyclone of gore and grated chunks exploded across Main Street. I was sitting in Roddys Pub with the other guys when the window suddenly went dark red with blood like rain. The thump scared the living daylights out of us, and we ran to the door when we realized all the windows were opaque.

I cant describe the scene outside. Suffice it to say, the sewer drains nearly overflowedour entire police force, several doctors, and numerous patients from the psych ward were later pieced together out of the morass. Sitting dead center was the same girl, knees curled up, arms over her head, as foot-deep blood swirled past her. Yet again, she had been the only survivor.

Only this time, we knew we were not dealing with a serial killer. Something far worse was happening. The girl, of course, had more or less lost her mind. She was also still drugged up from the ward, and told us everything in a stunned haze.

I truly wish she hadnt.

The nature of the anomaly was such that we could not speak to the media or ask for help from outside sources. We simply wouldnt be believed, and thered be more questions than answers, getting us all in deeper trouble. Though the mess was horrendous, we cleaned up the street as best we could and gave them all good Christian burials. Those hours of picking up body parts with my numb garbage-bag-gloved hands in the cold light of New Years Day rank among the second worst of my life.

The first worst hours came next New Years Eve.

We were all in it now; a town secret among the men. The anomaly was going to come back, and we had to be ready. Part of me hoped it wouldnt return, but the rest of me knew, with a sick feeling, that it would. It had been growing bolder each year, starting underground and then slowly moving into places that were increasingly public. If we didnt stop it, Lord knew where it would go next.

Last New Years Eve, we sat waiting in our houses. There was no drinking, as we would have to be sharp. There was no gathering, because it would find us. There were no last-minute goodbyes or phone calls; we didnt intend to die.

It came between one blink and the next, just before midnight, and just as the poor girl had said. She was my first sight: this would be her fourth time through nightmare. She didnt scream. She didnt move. She seemed completely resigned to her fate.

Recovering from the blurry odd feeling of being taken, I looked around at the others. There were the forty-three men wed expected, the girland several wives and children. My heart sank as I saw them. Someone had screwed up.

Beyond our scattered group, strange ivory tiles radiated out to meet smooth alabaster walls that arced around us in an unbroken circle. The ceiling, just reachable by a jump, held the same tiled pattern. I took this in quickly, then focused on the anomaly at our center.

It was as shed said: six thin black circles rotated on an axis to form the framework of a sphere shape. Each circle seemed to be made of impossibly thin material, like a fine wire honed into razorblade sharpness in every dimension. An ivory sphere hovered inside it, blank.

There was very little delay for getting our bearings. The ivory sphere lit blue while people were still cussing and looking at each other. The girl screamed to make them pay attention, and we looked down at our feet.

A large number of the semi-circular tiles on the floor had turned blue. I touched one, and it rose about a foot up and turned green.

Getting the idea, everyone else started running around and hitting the blue tiles, raising them up and turning them green while the sphere began humming louder. As it reached a crescendo, we realized that all the tiles had been activated, but we werent sure if that was what we were supposed to do. Apparently, it wasnt, because the sphere reached a high note, went silent, and altered one of its surrounding black circles.

The circle rotated until it was flat in the air, and then began expanding rapidly. People screamed, but we all ducked in time. Wed all seen what this thing had done to everyone else, and we werent about to get caught off guard. The worst injury was the removal of a small tuft of hair from Old Bensons mop. We crouched, relieved, until the lights on the floor changed and the humming began rising again.

All these factors, and certain details of the room I cant relate to you, told us the terrible truth. It was a puzzle, exactly as the girl had told usa childs puzzle, built by someone or something so exotically different from us that we found it murderous rather than simple. There were no instructions, the same way we dont put instructions on, say, a plastic tower with several brightly colored concentric rings of different sizes. The child was simply expected to try different permutations and have fun with no danger involved; but our ringed tower toy would seem very different to, say, a creature lethally allergic to plastic. It might ask: why would anyone make this? What monsters would create such a torture device?

And we asked those questions, too, as we failed to figure out the addition of red to the tiles. The second black circle around the sphere split into numerous vertical lines that began spiraling out through the room. Mercifully, these were slow, and only a single hand was lost among the crowd. One of the wives screamed in pain, but her husband was there to bandage her stump, stem the bleeding, and grab her loose hand for possible reattachmentassuming we got out of this in time.

The ceiling! The ceiling tiles were separate objects from the tiles below them! As the sphere began humming again, we all realized that at the same time. Jumping up, we hit red tiles, which turned blue and lowered. Below, we hit green raised tiles, which rose further and turned back to blue. The new color, yellow, only turned white when struck.

The men threw out numerous theories. Did it have something to do with primary colors? Were we supposed to make patterns? The two black waves had halted at the extremities of the circular roomshould we try to take advantage of the new small gaps in the spheres defense and destroy it directly?

Whatever we were doing wasnt working. The girl warned us that the deadly black energy lines could come back from the outer walls, so we all managed to duck as the first ring shot inwards and rejoined the spheres outer shell.

We all thought were actually getting somewhere. We all thought we could figure it out. Maybe we could have, given enough time but when we looked around for the fourth change, we saw nothing new.

Mary Baker stepped on a white tile, and it roseand turned blue.

The game hadnt been designed for us. There was only one chilling conclusion, something that not even the thrice-surviving girl had known: the puzzle involved colors we couldnt see. *It hadnt been built for our eyes!*

Collective hysterical screaming drowned out everything else. Our plans and strategies suddenly seemed stupid and ill-fated. We literally had no way to win. Every single person in that strange otherworldly trap was going to die.

Except there was one other catch; a sort of failsafe. I suspected it was the way the girl had survived three times already, and I was certain shed kept it to herself on purpose. It was why Id brought a knife and a gun, both hidden in my clothes. None of us intended to die, but I intended to die the least.

The game let out in the middle of deep backcountry woods. Initially, I thought this meant the anomaly was simply moving on a straight line to nowhere. Later, I would realize that it was actually halfway to the state capital.

There was no gore explosion this time. The black lines of energy hadnt torn apart nearly as many victims as before. All the blood and organs and intestines were still in the dead, held mostly together by their empty vessels. As the only survivor, exhausted and covered in blood myself, I walked straight home and took a shower. My first thought was not to tell anyone. I could never explain the disappearance of all those people, and certainly not a clearing in the woods filled with dozens of bodies.

You see, though the anomaly was built as some sort of puzzle for a child from a species unlike anything we can imagine, it was designed to be a multiplayer competition. The game automatically ends when only one participant is left.

I kept this burdenthis nightmare, trauma, and guiltto myself for an entire year. Tonight I speak. Maybe Ive lost my mind. I did think I could live with this and keep the secret to myself, just as the girl thought she could. She only cracked once the first time, and told Harold the homeless man. The police beat it out of her and sent her to an asylum; the cops, the doctors, and the other patients paid the price. We men heard it from her, and some of us told our wives and children, consigning them to death.

Thats another complication of being from a totally different culture than the anomaly: just talking about it acts as an invitation to the yearly game and we just dont know how to turn that invitation off. It might be as simple as a spoken phrase or a mental rejection in a particular manner unknown to us, or it might be something that requires organs or perceptions we dont have. In any case, this year, tonight, I speak, because I have no idea what might happen if Im the only player.

I tell myself that we can figure out the puzzle if we have enough peopleenough smart people, enough different people, that maybe someone has an inspiration or maybe someone has eyes that can detect the unseen colorsbut, to tell the truth, I want as many people as possible because Im just scared.

Scared, and sorry. Happy New Year'ssee you at midnight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is there anywhere a list which stories belong in which universe and in what order they should be read ? I have no idea whereto start with your stories, and the firstn 2 attempts didn't go so well. I bought all the ebooks I could get (6 all in all, long live amazon, though I saw there are new ones now, so once my bank account had time to recover from my christmas shopping spree, they are high on my list of things to buy) but did not read em all yet, but the ones I did where amazing (psychosis, the asylum and creepy tales). The next on my list is the 2 desolate guardian books(though I will wait till I can afford the third one, till then I'll read shadowrun ;) )

	<TEXT> Mona Wygant took a deep breath of freezing air and dragged Edgars limp body further up the snowy incline. Only after she reached the small cave in question did she realize what it truly was: a wound in the side of a massive amethyst pyramid that had crashed to the ground. Purple electrolytic fluids still oozed out and under the deepening snow, but she managed to avoid slipping. Pushing Edgar into the gap, she ducked inside just in time to avoid some ominous threat whirring by overhead. Friend or foe, she could not afford to discover.

She kneeled down uncomfortably to avoid the bubbling wall of the wound, as the solid flesh was still hot from the fading life processes of the giant gemstone. Quickly pulling more snow inside and propping Edgar up on a small patch of chilled amethyst, she unzipped his jacket and lifted his shirt.

Red. Everywhere red. She remained in place, unmoving. The person in her sat stunned. Absolutely everything had been torn away in the course of events wildly beyond her control, and she could feel the traumatic stress setting in. The doctor in her evaluated with cold expertise, isolating action and reason from those inner echoes of terror.

Edgar couldnt open his eyes, but he could speak, and his voice came out full of gravel and pain. How... bad...?

The parts of her that might have been able to lie were under too much pressure to engage. Youre going to die.

He coughed up small bits of blood. Unless?

No unless. She stared down at the wounds in his stomach. She stared down into his stomach.

Understanding slowly crept along Edgars blood-spattered face. He turned his head and studied the jagged purple cave that would surround his final thoughts and experiences. Im sorry.

Despite the wounds radiating inner heat, she felt numb. She knew what he was really talking about. Its alright. We were always just a default couple by process of elimination. I saw what the gender balance in our team was meant to accomplish pretty early on.

He coughed again. Still, Im sorry we didnt like each other better.

Youre fine. She followed his sudden shift in gaze to a lightly damaged transmorphic sphere lying dormant in flowing purple ooze. She looked back to him, took in his expression, and said, Got an idea?

No central controller, Edgar wheezed. Is my tech stuff still on my bike?

Just trying not to give into the dulling blanket of panic wrapped around her senses, she nodded and waited.

He lifted a hand weakly. Get it. And get that sphere.

She understood his intent. From what Verene had told the squad, the early predecessors of those spheres had been built to healand that ancient functionality might still exist within them. She couldnt let herself feel hope, but she could certainly feel the thrill of beating the odds through intellect. In that respect, she thought to herself, she and the video-game-minded Edgar might actually be a good match. Dont die while Im gone.

He gave a feeble nod.

Creeping up to the jagged exit of the amethyst pyramids wound, she studied the horizon-spanning blasted battlefield. The sickly yellow atmosphere that had once clouded the sky was now absent except for floating wispy traces that still hung stark against the pale blue of a natural afternoon. The tremendous formerly Shielded mountain that had housed Her Glory, previously supported on massive arching pylons, now lay on the ground, and ruptured on a scale Mona couldnt bring herself to comprehend. Bright violet energies still radiated uncontrollably from within, andin every directionspace itself fizzled with magenta static as large regions of earth and devastation flickered in and out from other places. The ground trembled underneath her amethyst pyramid, and thereby her feet, but her attention was solely focused on movement.

Far below, a helmeted stranger on a bike sped by in a grey jacket. Suddenly furious all over again, Mona leapt up, slung her automatic weapon forward, and sprayed rounds at the distant rider. To her surprise, he fell, and then bounced and rolled along the rough biomechanical ground. He didnt seem overly wounded; he must have only been grazed. If she ran closer, she could

But the bastard had fallen in the opposite direction from her hidden equipment, and Edgar had only minutes at best. Clenching her fist as the rider staggered to his feet and stumbled toward his bike, she turned the other direction. There wasnt time. He would escape.

Clambering down the slippery amethyst slope, she pushed her way through knee-high snow and into the quickly cooling body of a plant titan. Squeezing out into a clearing hidden within that tangle of knotted vines and bio-muscle, she ran to their two bikes and began unzipping Edgars bags in search of anything computer related.

Her search was stopped by the icy chill of a gun barrel against the back of her neck.

Slowly, she raised her hands.

A robotic voice spoke from behind her. **Put your gun on the ground.**

She carefully slid the strap over her head and lay the automatic weapon down. Without being prompted, she turned to face her captor.

The rider was humanoid. That much was all she could tell. The rest was hidden behind a black helmet and a grey uniform. The gun remained pointed at her, the hand that wielded it unwavering. These grey-clad bastards had silently infiltrated the offensive and betrayed everyone at the worst possible moment, and Mona felt absolutely nothing but anger at being in danger yet again. All her fear was already tied up in resonating traumas dancing behind her senses.

I dont have time for this, she told the stranger. Im a doctor, and Ive got a wounded man who needs treatment immediately.


No emotion was evident behind that helmets dark visor. **A doctor.** The robotic voice held no trace of identity. **What role is the wounded man.**

Role? She stared. Do you mean his skills? Hes our tech guy.

Without warning, the stranger lifted his other hand and looked at some sort of tablet device. **Name.**

Edgar Brace

The tablets screen flickered. **You are Mona Wygant.**

She took a deep breath, but decided to play along. Every moment of conversation with this strange humanoid gave her another opportunity for the situation to change. Yes.

**Surviving team members.**

Those distant singing traumas swung a little closer. Just us.

Her captor didnt move in the slightest at that response. Was he a robot? A cyborg? She was certain he didnt serve Her Glory. The tragedy at the Yellow Palace had made that clear. **Manners of death.**

Confident she wouldnt be shot in mid-sentence, she lowered her eyes from his black visor and gun to study other details about him while she spoke as if grieving. Randy Ellwood, Carmen Faulkner, Cheng Yao, Jennifer Pixley the portal nexus explosion. She noticed that a small patch or some identifying symbol had been carefully removed from the upper sleeve of her captors jacket at some point in the past. Kendrick Merrill, burned alive. His pants were grey-patterned military fatigues. Lian Yen shot herself. Now that was strange: his shoes were athleticnot boots. But she was out of time. Bill Nash. We were trapped. Locked into the factory lines. He used an amethyst pyramid to avoid being converted by Her Glory.

The gun rose swiftly back up to her face as her carefully anonymous captor demanded something new. **Alvarez.**

Frozen by tension, her eyes locked on his trigger finger for any signs of movement, she forced out a single word. What?

**Your finder.**

I still dont understand! She didnt even dare breathe.

**Only nine.**

She took an instinctual step back. Could he meanit had to be! We had a tenth member. He was sent on some sort of special mission weeks ago. Havent seen him since.

The grey-clad stranger finally moved, but only to back away and somewhat lower his gun.

Caught up in a surge of adrenaline at what felt like her only chance, Mona lashed out with one hand while the other moved to her hidden pistol.

Surprised, her captor pushed forward, and the two struggled bodily for a moment.

Remembering her training, she shot up a knee, but he blocked it with his thigh. His helmeted head came forward, bashing her in the face, but she took the full force and used that moment to punch him in the stomach.

He wasnt a robot. That much was certain. He staggered, but responded with a punch to her cheek, and she fell back. Instead of giving him free space to aim and shoot her, she pulled him down with her, and they struggled in semi-mechanical earth made muddy by leaking plant titan blood.

Fueled by all the horrors shed experienced that day, she fought with sharp fury, and another final kick sent the grey-jacketed stranger sliding in the mud. On her feet in a split second, and breathing hard nearly to the point of passing out, she pointed her gun down at him.

Why did you betray us? she screamed.

He stayed halfway up on one arm, unmoving, his visor locked on the gun. He did not answer.

She pushed the gun forward, adding to her threat. Why hide your identity?

**No one can know.**

What gives you the right to do what you did? she shouted, feeling the traumas finally reach her. Tears began slipping out of her eyes, but she blinked to keep them clear. We had it. Goddamnit, we had it! They told us to think creatively, and that we would know it when we saw it. If old enmities could have just been healed, Her Glory could have helped rebuild civilization.

**Do you really believe that.**

The negotiations hadnt reached any true conclusion, but the possibility had still been there. We could have rolled the dice. Found out! We are her people, and our home was her Empire. It was in her oncethe desire to help, to create, to build, and love for humanity. That love might still be there somewhere in her. Doesnt everyone deserve a second chance?

At that, the stranger pushed himself up out of the mud and stood, ignoring her gun. With one hand raised in deference, he picked up his own weapon and slotted it at his belt.

Stop! she screamed, riding a high storm of emotion. She wasnt sure she could stomach any more death and violence this day, but she tried to keep that doubt out of her voice. I *will* shoot you. Take off your helmet!

**We agree.** His unseen gaze remained on her, and he tilted his head slightly for a moment. **Everyone deserves a second chance. We are the Grey Riders, and our actions are our own. No one elses. Remember that.** He continued moving backwards until he found cover behind a thick bio-muscle fiber.

She ran forward, but the unknown rider was gonelost in the tangle.
 
Swearing at his escape and the time wasted by the encounter, she ran back to the bikes, grabbed Edgars gear, pushed painfully through the titans oozing flesh, and sprinted back up the snow-laden amethyst hill.

Edgar had moved since her departure. Now lying on his side near the defunct transmorphic sphere, he seemed to be using the last of his strength to study its inner components. Mona dodged around his trail of blood and the river of purple ooze and set up his computer and connectors without delay.

---

Day unknown. Late afternoon. Edgar is unconscious, but alive. He has a modified transmorphic sphere sealed up in his stomach, and I dont know what were going to do about that, but hes alive and stable for the moment. I am also alive, but my stabilitythats uncertain. Im exhibiting signs of shock, extreme stress, and fatigue. Cannot afford to self-prescribe meds, although I have some in my kits. I must remain aware and awake. Battlefield is still full of random chaos. Nobody in charge on either side.

We were too late, and Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind awoke. Thats all I know, other than what I heard on my squads radio chatter. Her Glory chose not to immediately kill us all, and some sort of negotiations were underway when it became apparent that some among the soldiers were not with us. Encountered one out here after the fact; they call themselves the Grey Riders. All identifying features obscured. He was even using a voice synthesizer.

Something went terribly wrong, and Her Glorys portal nexus suffered some sort of catastrophic event. This reality is a hellscape of random interdimensional static now, and I imagine any places her systems were connected to have also been affected.

It turns out our rift compass chips were originally her design, and, lacking the First Worlds hub systems, they reverted to serving her systems when we got too close. That was why all roads seemed to lead to her. NowI have no idea what might happen. My rift compass just spins randomly.

She could have done it. There was a *chance*. This could have been our solution. Shes been feared as a monster for nearly a thousand years, but who better than the Machine Empress of Mankind to return and save her children? Not only feeding everyone, but rebuilding the entire Empire through strength of intellect and compassion of the mind would she have gone for it? Could she have let go of her hate and distrust? I dont think well ever know for sure.

But all thats over. Its just me and Edgar now, and I have no idea how we can continue the mission on our own. Best guess is that the billions back home have two to four weeks left before mass death from starvation begins. I dont even want to think about what might happen if our worse natures get the best of those back home.

---

Shivering from shock and cold, she pressed up against the still-warm amethyst wall and finally let herself cry. Strangely, her thoughts kept coming back to the days before any of this had happened. Why had she spent so much time working? The hospital had been her life. Helping people and beating death were both very potent drugs, and shed somehow missed out on the whole relationship and family thing.

Shed focused on her job here, too, and now it was too late. The squads little family had formed without her, and then departed from this world despite all her medical skills and intelligence. Even Edgar, the last other survivor, had figured out a tech solution for survival more or less himself.

---

I guess theres nothing to do now but work our way home and pray that the other wings of the Vanguard found something.

---

She sat by herself at the edge of their little cave, watching the tremendous battlefield blink and glitch with magenta inter-reality static. Yellow bodies littered the hillocks here and there, and spiky biomechanical spires were already growing up along dead plant titans and broken amethyst pyramids. In the extreme distance, the horizon still burned with traces of nuclear fire. Over everything, a deepening white began obscuring the death and destruction.

This feeling she pressed harder against the warm inner amethyst. It was smallness. Thats what it was. Whole races, monsters, and titans had fought here, and she had been unable to help in even the slightest way. The fate of the human race was on the line, and there was nothing she could have done. It was all up to the random whims of existence now, and the fortitude of a million men and women a hundred realities distant.

She had never felt smaller.

Her eyes fell on the snow accumulating just outside, and she shuddered against the deepening cold. Was this an effect of the ruptured portal nexus? It had already felt like they had been running from winter itself for quite some time. Had the damage made things worse?

Her gaze drifted over to Edgar. He was stable, but still quite injured. It would be some time before he could even ride on his own.

Bullshit, she muttered, rejecting that overwhelming feeling of helplessness. She didnt have to save the human race to make a difference. That would be up to the heroes Edgar always talked about. No, her job was just to do what she could. Saving just one life would still be an accomplishment. Screw all these nightmares and heroes. Screw the callousness of existence.

And Death could rot in hell for good measure.

Up on her feet, she began dragging Edgar. The thigh-deep snow kept him from bumping into anything too hard or sharp, and she pulled with all her exhausted strength. Every step was a trial, but it was a trial she desperately needed.

Leaving him momentarily at the base of the snow-covered amethyst, she squeezed through the thicket of dead plant titan and pushed their bikes out through the mess.

Okay, what now? she asked aloud, even knowing Edgar couldnt really hear her. She regarded the task at hand for a moment, and then pulled a rope from one of the gear kits. Tying the bikes together at several points, she formed a little construct that would roll forward and stay upright on its own. Lifting Edgar up with great care, she laid him across the two seats. It would be horribly uncomfortable, but it would have to doand he couldnt really feel anything right now anyway.

As the falling snow grew into thick wavering curtains, she finished tying him to the bikes. Alright. One breath, one moment of respiteshe began pushing forward.

Much of their fuel had been consumed on their long journey, but the bikes were still heavy. That weight made it tough to get going, but then assisted her as she slogged through the snow. Seeing her makeshift pallet working, she actually laughed. The days horrors still hovered outside her senses, but progress would keep them at bay.

Where to? Did it even matter? She kept pushing with one hand so as to not lose momentum and used the other to bring out her rift compass. As before, it showed totally random and useless readings. Determined not to let her burst of morale fade, she recalled their prior reality. Hadnt the ground been a strange sort of rusted and corrugated surface? Shed seen something like that through one of the blinking static glitches from her high perch.

There it was. The rectangular violet-and-white energies flickered in and out of existence about a quarter-mile distant.

Push. She kept that word in her head, repeating it over and over. Push.

The slope became a little steeper downhill, and rolling forward through the snow became easier.

Push!

Moving along at an actual decent pace, she was able to put less pressure on the bikes and spend her energy walking to keep up instead. Not wanting to stop, she eyed the blinking rectangle ahead. The timing would be forgiving, but there was still a chance it might close on them, and she didnt want to find out what would happen.

Open for six seconds, closed for two, open for one, closed for two, repeat okay, all she had to do was get through during that six seconds.

Moving at a faster pace, she began lightly running alongside the bikes. Closed. One, two. Open. One. Closed. One, twonow!

The bikes began bouncing subtly under her hands as the surface beneath changed. The broken energies behind her continued to flicker, but theyd made it through safely.

She zipped her jacket a little higher. It was colder herenoticeably sobut she hadnt expected it because there was almost no snow. Studying the blank white-and-rusted landscape, she guessed it was because there was less moisture.

Pushing forward again, and focusing all extra willpower on ignoring the uncomfortable vibrations coming up through the wheels, she checked her rift compass. Its readings were still scattered, but less chaotic. That was a good sign: distance from the epicenter would surely help. In that case, simply finding any rift at all would be good enough for now.

The nearest was another half-mile, and she pushed even beyond a growing numbness in her legsnot from the biting cold, but from sheer fatigue. She didnt want to face it, but the doctor in her knew that her body would soon give out.

The rift here was also one of the glitchy magenta rectangle kind, but her compass managed to stabilize it despite its other troubles. Regretting the need to stop to do it, she put the last of her strength into getting the two bikes and their unconscious passenger rolling again.

She vaguely recognized the sky tint and ice-crusted flora on the other side from somewhere a week or two back, which meant shed managed to find her way quite far along the squads previous path by sheer luck, but she didnt have time to appreciate her good fortune. The bikes were not lashed together appropriately to roll backwards, and her ability to turn them had also been tied to nearly nil, so she was forced to make a wide circle through surprise agony.

Every second of that blinding and freezing pain brought untold torture, and she was forced to close her eyes and hope she had the circle right. The wind on this side wasnt just gale force: it had to be below zero. Screaming against the river of hellishly cold air, she opened her eyes just a slight bit to see that she had almost missed the rift. Angling hard to the side, she rolled back through into what was, comparatively, blessed warmth. She had no doubt that even a few more seconds on the other side would have killed them both.

Falling to her knees, she held herself tight, shook painfully, and struggled with absolute despair. The cold had been absolutely brutal, yes, but skipping back along their path like that had given her a piece of the puzzle shed been missing.

Above her, Edgar stirred in his bindings. What the hell was that

Come on, Wygant, she whispered to herself through cold-burned lips. Youve got a patient.

Mona? he called out, unable to see her.

Managing to stand despite the nearly uncontrollable shivering wracking her body, she fell against the bikes and began pushing with her body weight. Exercise was the only thing she had left to warm herself.

Just below her face, Edgar looked up at her. Where are we

She shook her head.

The mission? he asked. We have to keep going.

She shook her head again.

His bloodied face grew concerned.

Edgar, she whispered, her lungs still burning. No more mission.

After a deep and wheezing breath, he asked, Why?

What other conclusion could there be? Her heart felt like solid ice, and she brought the bikes to a stop, out of all strength and willpower. Theyre all dead.

His eyes went distant. Back home?

She managed a distracted nod.

Thought it was strange, he gasped, adjusting his awkward position along the bike seats. They didnt give us any winter gear. He raised a hand and touched her cheek, bringing her a slight warmth through contact. They did it so we cant even try to make it back

No reinforcements, she realized aloud, suddenly recalling the hopelessness among the second waves command staff. Just us, and the second wave, and that was it. Everyone else is dead. Frozen to death weeks ago.

Grey clouds parted without warning, bringing desperately needed warmth down from a worried Sun.

After many moments of silence spent trying to warm up, Edgar breathed, Why lie?

You know, she responded, leaning across the bikes to hold him tight.

Because wed have never volunteered for the real mission, he said, answering his own question. To just go. Anywhereanywhere at all. To give up, to *not* stay and fight, to have the best and brightest just go somewhere that wasnt home, to find some warm place with just enough food to hide away in and have babies.

It hadnt been just to instill in-squad loyalty in foreign lands with no command structure, Mona realized. Shed noticed the gender balance had been strange for a military expedition, but the Councils plan had been so much deeper than that and the lie hadnt been just for them. The lie had also kept three hundred and fifty billion people waiting back home; three hundred and fifty billion people that could never been fed or saved; three hundred and fifty billion people that would have just descended into chaos and cannibalism as the hunger became lethal.

The statistics theyd been told had been right, after all. Almost nobody from the Vanguard would return homebut only because theyd never been intended to.

Its still tough for me to move, Edgar whispered, trying to save his strength. And you look done. What do we do?

She could only shake her head. On our own? Out here? The answer was obvious, simple, and unsatisfying: nothing. Every new reality held horrid unknown dangers, and they couldnt stay in this barren rusted wasteland. There was no going, and no staying; no more options.

So distracted by their despair, they didnt notice the grey-trimmed motorcycle riding up from behind until the rider was already dismounting.

Mona turned with a surprising last burst of speed and pointed her pistol at the Grey Rider. She cursed silently as she suddenly remembered shed forgotten her automatic rifle back in the plant titans tangle.

The newcomer lifted his hands and shouted. Whoah!

His uniform was not grey, and instead held the symbols of the Vanguard. Slowly lifting his helmet off, he revealed his gaunt and determined face.

Suddenly filled with light and relief, Mona began laughing.

What? Edgar shouted, unable to see. Who is it?

The newcomer spoke for himself, and cautiously. Hey Edgar. Its Clint.

Edgar shouted happily. You son of a bitch! What a time to show up!

Ive been behind you the whole way, he said softly. You seem in bad shape. Ive got some food I found, if thatll help. Lets go get the others.

Relieved, but also saddened, Mona shook her head. Theyre dead, Clint. All of them.

He began rooting through his bags, casually rejecting her sentiment. Nah, I dont think so.

What? Why dont you think so? The Grey Rider had said something about a *finder* Mona couldnt believe it, but there might actually be hope after all.

Just a hunch. I cant explain it, Clint said, his gaze suddenly distant.

Alright then. Mona accepted his food and separated out some to feed to Edgar. Could it be true? It looks like were going into overtime. You want to fight a little further before we have those babies?

Edgar smiled fearfully. Yes please. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> During a semester abroad in Japan, I had a strange encounter with a ghostly scarred woman in a green dress... and when I got back to America, she was already waiting for me in my home. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Im not just some crazy girl. Youll believe me if you just *take a moment* and see the Leech the way I saw it. I know you will. Just *listen.*

It started when I was in Japan. Id been living with a host family for a few months, and my semester abroad was almost over. I had the nerve to believe Id begun to acclimate; that I understood their culture and could call myself one of them.

On more than a few nights, gathered around the fire, they told me their superstitions and scary stories. Their myths were very different from the ones Id grown up with, and I found them fascinating, but not scary. They were too different.

There was a heavy emphasis on choice. Rather than facing a mindless slasher that simply wanted to kill you, many Japanese horror stories involved entities approaching an unwary victim in a public place and giving them a choice. If the victim answered one way, they would be killed horribly in a specific manner. If the victim took the other choice they would be killed horribly in another specific manner. These unwinnable situations made me laugh until the father of my host family explained to me, in quiet tones, the true subtext.

It was all about the third option. It was all about the innate fear of customs in a very traditional society. The only way to survive was to simply *know* the acceptable third answer and give that one instead. He squeezed my arm and told me that I, as a foreigner, stood no chance of knowing the third answer. If I saw someone approaching me in public, no matter how innocent it seemed, I was to run away before they could speak and give me that fatal choice.

I smiled and laughed it off, but his warning made me shiver a few times over my last few days. As a girl alone in another country, I was already on guard while walking through public spaces, but the towering maze of Tokyo took on a grey and tense tone whenever I thought of what might lurk among the crowds. I stuck to paths that went through the many hidden gardens and parks, and I always looked around warily.

That fear faded, though. I cant tell you why, not exactly. I was young, I thought I was smart, and I was American. Nothing could *really* hurt me. And besides, I was one of them now, right? Id spent months there living like they did! So, on my last day, when a woman began walking intently toward me from the opposite end of a long subway car, I stayed in my seat.

She had long black hair, beautiful dark eyes, and a dark green dress that seemed out of place in a crowded car otherwise filled with grey shirts, dark suits, and white blouses. I saw these details about her before I saw the deep scars on her face and hands, as if a maniacal American slasher had brutally carved her up and left her to die some years ago. As she shuffled toward me, the lights flickered once.

The boy in the seat next to me shivered and focused worriedly on his portable game. Adults looked away, tense, and the teenagers opposite me finally stopped talking and began staring at their shoes. *They knew.* They knew, and there was nothing any of them couldor woulddo for me. I was a foreigner, and a stranger to them.

But they listened. Oh, did they listen. I could almost hear them straining their ears to hear her whispers over the keening of wheels on rails beneath us. Every small step the woman took seemed louder than the one before.

Even then, I still didnt believe. I thought it was a prank, or someone being strange. I thought the others in the car with me were turning away out of courtesy or disgust at her scars. When I saw a tear fall from the cheek of the boy next to mewhen I saw it splatter onto his game screen while he continued to pretend to playthat was when I understood.

She stood directly above me, and I raised my eyes to meet hers.

Her scars crinkled horribly as she gave me a seemingly innocent smile, and she asked, in a pleasant but whispery voice: Do you have a sister?

I froze. If I said yes, what would happen? If I said no, what *else* would happen? When the lights flickered again and her face moved without moving right down close to mine, I almost panicked and told her the truth.

Inches away from me, her smile widened. She turned her head slowlyhorribly slowlyuntil her neck reached a ninety degree angle.

On the verge of passing out from fright, I forced myself to start breathing again.

Her smile turned into an angry frown.

I cowered back against the person behind me, who shrieked.

The scarred woman in green began to reach for mebut the car came to a smooth stop, the doors opened, and I dodged around her and ran out with the crowd. To their credit, none screamed. They simply hurried off to their various destinations while attempting to seem like nothing was wrong. Nobody wanted to draw attention to themselves; nobody wanted to get noticed by the woman in green or by polite society.

I ran all the way to my host familys house, but nobody was home. It was my last day, and wed already said our goodbyes, but it still felt odd that they were gone. Still trembling, I took a taxi to the airport, made my flight, and tried to rationalize the encounter away. The only hint I had that it had even happened was a small cut on my upper arm where she had nearly grabbed me with her horribly long nailsa cut that had, strangely, already begun to heal into a scar.

Hours into my international flight, I finally began to calm down, and I even started feeling a bit smug. Not only had I survived an encounter with a Japanese horror entity, Id even managed to immediately take a flight straight the hell out of the entire country. I would not end up as another unwitting cautionary tale. I was a born and bred American girl that had seen every horror movie under the sun, and Id made all the right decisions. Awesome.

I told the story to a guy sitting next to me on my flight, and he asked, What if she shows up here on the plane? Where will you run?

Yeah, I shut up right about then, and stayed tense for the next few hours. Eventually, though, I realized I would be doomed no matter what if the woman in the green dress showed up here, so I finally gave in and slept. Awake or asleep, it didn't matter.

My neighboring guy woke me before we landed, joked that hed kept guard, and reported that nobody had come for me while Id been out. Half-heartedly thanking him, I made polite conversation, left the plane, got my stuff, and met my parents outside the airport. It was bright, sunny, and open here, and it was a relief to be back home. This was the land of simple horrors; of gory violence, zombies, and haunted locations. The scarred woman in the green dress would have no power here, if indeed shed existed at all.

I was talkative and happy on the ride home, and my parents were glad to see me. I didnt tell them about my horrible encounter, because it honestly slipped from my mind. Everything was good. I was safe.

We pulled up to the house where Id grown up, and it looked exactly like Id remembered. Only a few months had gone by, true, but itd felt like a lifetime. Lugging in my stuff alongside my dad, I began to recount some funny memory that had come to mind, when I entered the front door, turned toward the kitchenand saw her standing there.

Green dress, scars, smile and all, the woman from the subway car thousands of miles distant stood waiting for me in my childhood home. She gave that same eerie smile and lifted a large knife.

I screamed and dropped my bags. Startled, my father dropped his, too, and my mother rushed in from outside. The woman in green brought the knife down.

She raised it, and then brought it down again, chopping vegetables.

Mistaking my reaction, my mother began screaming with me, but happily, and she pulled me forward. Its good to see your sister again, isnt it?!

Suddenly I was forced into a hug with both my mom and the woman in greenbut instead of trying to hurt me, the horrible stranger just smiled. Its good to see you sis.

I pulled away, trembling forcefully. I immediately sensed that something was off, and Id seen enough movies to know to keep my cards close to my chest. Mom, whats going on?

What do you mean, honey? she asked, smiling happily at us both before moving deeper into the kitchen to help cook.

The scarred woman in green kept her gaze and neutral smile fixated on me as I moved away from her, around the kitchen island, and toward my mom. Why is she here?

Who?

Her. I returned the womans stare.

My mother laughed. Youve been away too long, dear. You remember that your sisters graduated and back from college now.

I gulped. Humor me, momwhy doesnt she look like us?

My father came down the stairs, returning from dropping off my bags, and gave me a black look. I thought we were past this. Its not nice to keep harping on your sister for being adopted.

Horrified, I took a step back, and bumped into the fridge. But how? Oh, I guess Im super jet lagged sorry, I was just trying to remember when that was. For a birthday present for her and all.

My father sighed. Same day you were born. He stepped out to get more bags from the car.

I turned away, mortified. My sister never took her gaze off of me, almost taunting me with her expressionless invasion. As we both stood there, facing off silently, she lifted her knife and brought it down on her own arm, right along one of her scars.

She didnt flinch. Instead, I did. Gripping my arm and looking down, I saw the skin slice open, bleed, heal, and fade into a scar in moments. Aghast, I looked at her, and saw the equivalent cut disappearing from her arm. Her smile grew a little wider.

I opened my mouth to scream something with fury, but the scarred woman lifted a knife and pointed it at my mothers backthe implication was clear.

The best I could do was to take the knife from her by offering to cook and insisting that my sister sit down at the table and relax. She did so, apparently willing to play a social game of cat and mouse. As I chopped up vegetables and stared at the scar on my arm, my thoughts raced. This entity had somehow attached itself to my life! Looking around at pictures in the kitchen, I saw her in photographs that I recognizedfamily photos that now included her, as a child, as a teenager, as a womanscarred from the outset. I kept my eyes on her as she sat the table, and she stared right back at me the entire time. Her disfigured smile never once changed.

We actually sat down and had dinner as a family. My parents didnt seem to notice that my sister never spoke unless directly addressed, and even then only with perfect politeness. She ate little, and kept her eyes always on me. Halfway through dinner, I got angry, and I slammed my fist on the table.

She took her dinner knife and drew it across her cheek.

I fought hard not to scream as I felt my face split open, bleed, and then heal. I already knew there would be a scar, but I excused myself to go to the bathroom and look for myself. Once there, it occurred to me that the Leecha leech on my life, time, and soulseemed to be punishing me for rudeness. I remember saying to the mirror: Alright, you bitch. Ill play your game. I just needed time to figure out

Another slice opened up near my ear, bled, and quickly healed over into a scar.

Shed heard me from the dining room.

Or she could hear me no matter what.

Walking carefully back into the dining room, I put on my best graces and sat with a smile. I couldnt think about the scars. Were they permanent? Would I live the rest of my life disfigured? Plastic surgery might fix a few, but if this kept going no, I would just have to be polite and proper until I could figure out how to destroy her.

I volunteered to help clean up dinner and do the dishes, and my mother seemed surprised, saying that my time in Japan had done me good. I didnt know what she meant by that, but I managed to get through the evening without any further scars.

That night, I tried to whisper to my father in the dark, but he didnt understand what I meant, and I earned another scar on my arm. I slipped downstairs and into her room. My sister sat holding a knife to her arm and grinning wider than Id ever seen.

What do you *want?* I asked her.

She held the knife higher on her arm, just above a clear patch of skin where her scars had left her and been transferred to me. Do you have a sister?

Suddenly remembering that moment of mortal threat in the subway car, I said nothing.

She did not cut herself, but she did wait, always staring, ever staring.

I backed out and went to my own bedroom, where I lay stressed for hours. I did sleep eventually, but only because jet lag forced me into it.

The next few days were filled with terribly costly chess moves. I invited over old friends to see if they recognized her as my sisterand they did. For each of these conversations with confused friends, I earned another scar. The Leech knew what I was trying to do, and she disapproved.

The worst part was running into an ex-boyfriend and finding out that he didnt remember our relationship. After much pressure, he finally admitted, I liked your personality, but I didnt ask you out because of your scars sorry.

I remember screaming, and earning another scar for it. Rushing home, I looked at old year book pictures. The scars werent just appearing nowthey were appearing *back then,* too. Id always had them! That same ex-boyfriend would later remember asking out *my sister* instead. The Leech was draining away my life right before my eyes!

What would happen when she ran out of scars and I had them all?

I couldnt talk to my parents. I couldnt talk to my friends. I shut myself in my room and spent each day alone to avoid any further social improprieties. Id been raised American, raised rude, proud, and free, and I kept making mistakes. It was in me to swear, to nettle, and to tease, and the cost was just too high. My host familys father had been right: I was losing because I was from the wrong culture. Had I been a traditional and proper Japanese girl, the Leech might never have punished me even once.

The Leech existed to punish deviance. The Leech fed off of outsiders, rebels, and bad children. The Leech was part of me now

She only had a few scars left when the idea came to me. She had this huge asinine grin all the time now, and stood in my room while I slept, staring at me, basically daring me to say something rude. She held a knife over me while I slept, yes, but it was not to cut me. It was to cut herself.

And thats what gave me the idea. Furious, and desperate beyond description, I decided that I wanted my life back at any cost. Id been thinking of the Leech in two ways: I could avoid being rude and live under her threat for the rest of my life, or I could be myself and find out what punishment awaited once all the scars had been inflicted upon me. I feared that second option. I was terrified. When the Leech became clear and beautiful, and I became horrid and misshapen, what would she do to me? Would she kill me? Discard me when I stopped being useful? Would I cease to exist altogether? Would my life completely become hers?

Id been so afraid of that second option, it took me until she only had one scar left to remember what my benefactor had said: there was a third option, one unknowable to any but the most socially integrated, and Id had enough time to see that, for the Leech, the social game went both ways.

We were not in Japan. We were in America. Here, victims got tough when the end was nigh.

She was with me always, then. She walked directly behind me, goading me, irritating me, pushing me with her silence and her grin; oh, that perfect smile on that beautiful face. It mocked me.

I stood in the kitchen with her, and I drew out the same knife she had been holding when Id first come home and found her attached to my life and timeline like the horrific Leech that she was. I smiled at her, matching her expression, and I brought the knife down before she could react.

Not on heron myself. I slashed open my arm, and blood splattered across the kitchen island. She gasped and pulled back, her hair hiding her face. I saw her clutch her arm, and I saw a scar appear in the equivalent place where I had slashed myself. I wasnt healing, but I had actually managed to injure her. Id thought long and hard about it: cutting her would only mean cutting myself; but cutting myself meant cutting her.

I slashed again, this time on my face.

She screamed. Finally, God! Id long prayed to hear that noise from her. I slashed again, on my leg, and she fell to her knees. My blood splattered across her green dress, soiling it, and I slashed myself again and again and again. I felt faint, and still I cut myself, turning my arms, legs, face, and tummy into oozing mincemeat and gobs of flesh. With each strike, she screamed louder and crumpled further.

I fell to my knees before her, a wall of pain and ebbing gore, and I smiled at her as her scream reached a crescendo that soared into nothingness. With a last gasp, she shrank and blackened until she became nothing more than a grasping little animalan actual leech. Without a person to latch onto, she was nothing but a worm.

With the last of my strength, I stood up and stomped on her.

It was over.

I called 911 after that, of course. And, equally as expected, you think Im crazy. But you have to *listen.* She was real, but shes gone now, and Im not going to do this again. I killed her. I know Ill be scarred all over, just like she was, but at least Ill get to live. Ill get to swear. Ill get to drink. Ill get to

Remorse? For what?

Why are you asking me that question?

Find the guy on the plane. Hell tell you what I told him. No way hed forget.

Youre not hearing me.

Find anyone who was on the subway that day. In my car. Theyll tell you.

Why do you keep saying that?

Stop asking me that question!

She was a Leech. She took everything that should have been mine. If shed just never been adopted, it would have been *my* life. They would have been *my* friends, *my* boyfriends, *my* prom date. She was always there, always in my goddamn house, always so much *better* than me, always mocking me with that beautiful face.

*I dont have a sister!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How much do they usually cost? Is it in the tens, the hundreds or gasp thousands!?

The price is typically $50 to $500, with the actual number varying greatly on quality. $100 is a good sweet spot for 'great cover, great price'. $500 is top professional level, which most of us don't really need.

 Aside from the fellow above, what are some ways to create such a website, one with your own personal style reflecting you and your book? I'm VERY bad with web design. The last time I tried to make a website it looked like Grandma sat down with the neighborhood goth kid to create a website.

You should start with a free Wordpress blog, and they have lots of custom themes to handle how it looks. Put some time into it over the years and learn how to do custom themes if you want to stand out.

 Also, to ask more on what you were speaking of with bloggers and reviewers... I'm extremely nervous to get my book reviewed by anyone, but I know I need to before I try to publish it. How can I go about that and are there places or people who, even if they must be honest can let me down gently without saying "You suck, you should never write another world, kill yourself and die knowing you were the worlds worst writer, etc, etc." ?

Professionals won't say anything like that :) at worst, they'll never respond. It's implied industry standard to not post a review unless you liked the book. After all, nobody's going to want reviews from someone who might 1 or 2 star them. </TEXT>

The darkness she had struggled with her entire life finally took hold once she realized Conrad was truly gone, and that the same would eventually happen to me. I could actually feel it coming on, though I never told her. The only thing that kept me going was love for her. I still saw that small little girl in her, desperately trying to keep her world together as her family and home constantly changed. I refused to see the effect her inner pain was havingright up until the mobs were at the door.

Something had gone wrong, and our allies had never arrived.

The worlds that had split off from our own held many similarities, including duplicate people in many cases, and open doors between worlds existed in the hands of the elite and powerful. This caused enormous unanticipated trouble with record- and law-keeping, and sudden shifts in population due to any number of factors. Without Gi to provide solutions, the citizenry of these various worlds had no idea what to do. Tremendous leaps in technology had been thrust upon them before theyd truly been ready, and social unrest had swelled the worlds over. Beyond smashing the gates between worlds, they began smashing her creations themselves, and then came for her.

All this, while she obsessed over her eternal struggle with Death; all this, while she began running experiments on animals domestic and foreign. Her mystical aura of wonder became a fearful legend of terror even to those who knew her.

She was an anger-filled cinder shadow of the girl I had known, but she still refused to loose machines of death upon the world. She confided in me, at the last, that she had never stopped feeling guilty for throwing those small spiky weapons at the feet of the murderers that had killed Ernest and then come for her. Or, so she told herself, because all tangible emotion about the event had long since faded. The same ennui that had claimed the love of her life was now creeping upon me, and, soon, upon her. Sitting on her gilded yellow throne next to Conrads empty green seat, she told me she had caught herself actually considering using weapon devices on the mobs battering in the doors of the palace. It was the logical choicethe mechanical choiceif she were to retain power and truly fight against Death with all resources possible.

I said nothing, and she understood. I had once, long ago, promised myself that I would not outlive her. Now, that promise seemed strange and twisted.

For the good of all, she fled to the outer worlds, and I went with her, still hoping to keep her on the path of Good. I hoped that I could maintain that last duty despite the will-draining apathy snaking through my heart. I hoped.

She made me promise that, if she ever became the monster she fearedif the centuries ate away at her, if she forgot what it meant to be humanthat I would stop her from hurting people.

To her, I swore this last oath: if she lost herself, I would ensure that Death finally found her.

---

Verene finished writing in the journal that had been issued to her. Despite the absolute emptiness that usually rested where her willpower should be, she felt strange. It was almost *surprise.* She had set out to write a simple report as ordered, but had written far more, consuming the entire night. The Sun now rose behind the sickly yellow clouds.

Memories continued to rise and make themselves known in her awareness. Was Her Glory waking? Was this an effect of that connection regenerating? For reasons she could not understand, she stood, found a nearby vehicle yard, and picked a bike that matched her ever-present armor. Riding forward, she found the squad that had recently travelled with her; those who seemed to have more will remaining than the others. That was important. She was not sure why.

Are you ready? she asked. You *must* succeed in this.

You seem fairly lively this morning, their dark-skinned doctor said, her gaze curious.

I cant be lively, she responded, subtly energized in strange ways. Im dead.

She regarded the preparations for war all around her with age-old eyes. It was just like the mobs at the door. The mechanisms here were all for self-defense and operating on autopilot, but their creator was about to awaken once more.

This was that moment all over again, when Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind could choose to fleeor choose differently this time; choose to strike back and slaughter with her horrific weapons. The random ire and ignorance of humanity had come to burn down her palace once again, but if she chose the darker path

Verene had forgotten many things, but she had not forgotten her promise. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-11-26 00:03:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Her Glory the Machine Empress was not always known by that official title. I knew her first as a little girl with long blonde hair and a calculating but well-intentioned temperament. I was a commoner, but, having somehow fallen into the duty of teaching young ones in the household in the years before her birth in 989 AD, I was allowed the privilege of speaking to her with familiarity. Those closest to her called her most often by her short-name, Gi. Named after her aunt, Gi contrarily shared no traits with that outgoing and straightforward woman, instead preferring solitude, introspection, and long hikes spent observing the workings of nature.

Our bond as teacher and student was a close one, for Gi held an absolute fascination for puzzles. Even as a mere babe, her simple toys were quickly discarded unless they could be used in greater designs of her own making. Her aptitude was such that she reached my tutelage at a far earlier age than her peers, and her quiet nature was such that I often had to protect her from the merciless teasing of those peers. For that, and for the puzzles and games I acquired from increasingly exotic sources, she chose to trust me with her inner thoughts.

She spent most of her time alone, reading books, examining collected bugs and frogs, or solving increasingly complex tasks. After only a few years, her puzzles were left behind in favor of mathematics and sciences, fueled mainly by numerous large tomes for which I had gone to great lengths to smuggle. It was not against custom in any flagrant way for her to study these topics, but we both wished to keep the true scope of her advanced studies secret from her father. He was an ambitious man, and greatly concerned with power and appearance. There was no way to know his potential reaction.

Around eight years of age, she first had her heart broken by a young boy, and I encouraged her to think of peopleother children, her parents, court and allas a new level of puzzle to work through. People had infinite depth in their hearts, I told her, but their behavior ran according to strict rules all the way from the individual to the societal level. She took this to heart, and, that same year, carefully watched and listened to every moment of her fathers rise to the position of Duke.

She watched with that same detached calculation five years later as her father triedand failedto become King. She remained distant and stoic as we left the household for Brunswick to join the household of Brun, a man she had never met and to whom she had been engaged, and she did not shed a single tear when news reached us several months later of her fathers death. She felt these changes and losses deeply, but it was not until her fourteenth birthday that she confided in me her true trouble.

Both her parents had been distant descendants of the same powerful man, and, she guessed, that legacy had somehow found expression in her. One bright summer day, I followed her out to a copse of trees with a trusted handmaiden that had been sworn to secrecy, and she showed me what she called her curse.

I remember still that moment with vivid awe. The sky was cheerily peppered with subtle white strokes, the Sun was bright, and the dirt was warm brown from fresh rain. The green hill behind us hid our activities. After hastily drying a patch of grass with the arm of her dress, she laid out one of her smuggled mathematics books and stood over it. Watch, she said, terrified. The sun has passed thrice as I labored over this solution. I grew wroth, and something in me snappedand then, my written answer became correct without any understanding on my part.

Gisela, I said to her, touching her white-and-blue-clad shoulder. The mind continues to calculate while we sleep. Perhaps time

No! she screamed, and her handmaiden cowered at her ire. My written answer did not change. The *problem* changed! It twisted itself to suit my desire!

I stared down at the open pages, and I saw numbers and symbols I knew to be true; to have always been true. At the same time, I stared down at those open pages, and I saw numbers and symbols whose calculations twisted in on themselves in alien ways. Her answer was wrong, but her answer was also rightthrough sheer willpower.

Her handmaiden knew nothing of these subjects. Recovered from her fright at Gis shouting, she laughed along with our delightful play. I did not avail her of the enormity of my terror. Warmed by the Sun, cooled by the days breezes, I stood and contemplated the consequences of a power that could bend the underpinnings of existence to its will. Gi, that beautiful little blonde baby, had grown into a fourteen-year-old witch of considerable raw talent.

They would kill her if they knew.

I played it off as the joke that the handmaiden believed it was and sent her home. Once she was gone, I bent down to Gis height, gripped her shoulders, and told her: This must remain secret.

I know, she told me, tears beginning to stream down her cheeks.

She clasped me, and it was then that I understood that she had been living with this secret for at least a year already. She had been sent away from her family as a bride to a stranger, and now even her father had been called to the next life. She was aloneexcept for me. I resolved to protect her with my life. I swore on it.

I had no idea what I was swearing to in that moment, but, gazing down on those tear-filled eyes so full of fear and isolation, Im not sure I could have chosen otherwise. I had watched her grow from a baby into a tortured young woman, and I was determined not to outlive her.

Little Liudolf was born not too much later. The birth was a difficult one, and Gi almost died. For weeks afterward, she spiraled into a dark miasma, and only once spoke to me. In her chambers, she said, I had an idea for a contraption that would reduce pain. It was all I could think about while

But I cut her off, as was my very occasional right as her confidant. I knew that she was consumed by the social impropriety of her desire to create. I had thought long on providing some outlet. Then build it, and we will smuggle it to mothers who may still benefit.

And that took her darkness away. For three weeks, she toiled in secret with our doddering old physician and two young metallurgists. Her husband Brun did not care where she spent her time, and good for all that, as some of the household began whispering about her time spent with apprentice blacksmiths swarthy and tall. But that all came to an end with the creation of her first device, and I took it into the nearby village as soon as I heard of a coming birth.

It worked, despite our old physicians confused comment to mein privatethat it should not have. The mother in question gave birth with ease, and the babe was as healthy as could be hoped. It had taken much convincing to let me stab the woman with the devices tiny needles, but, after the fact, word soon spread through whispers and gossip. I told her that it was a new device for reducing infant mortality built by the physicians in distant Rome, and that is what she told others.

Gi waited eagerly for each new tale that I brought her of mothers and babes whose pains had been eased by the fruit of her thoughts. It was amazing to me, as well, that a combination of metals, acids, needles, and alchemical materials could produce such a specific result, though I always kept in mind her secret curse. Was her device a true child of science, or had she simply willed it to perform as it did? There was no way for me to know: her knowledge had surpassed mine.

But that did not mean I had lost my place in her life. As the holder of her closest bond, I stayed at her side through three more births over the next seven years, and I continued to carry her devices in secret to the people of Brunswick. With each passing season, new ideas sprung forth in her mind, and she worked obsessively in dark back rooms of the manor to produce wonders that helped heal broken legs, reduce fevers, sanitize waste, and any number of other marvels.

So elated by her successes, she grew careless, and Brun found us one night in her hidden smithies. His first concern was that of an affair, and he seemed nonplussed; when one of the handsome blacksmith boys tried to explain himself and show Brun what had truly been happening, the Count grew pale.

I was standing in the back of the smithy, beyond the forge. I did not believe he saw me, as servants were as good as invisible to men of his station. He saw only Gisela and the two blacksmiths that had helped her these long seven years. No longer apprentices, they had become masters in their own right, and sworn to brotherhood for their years of mutual toil in secret. Deathly quiet, his eyes fierce, Brun ordered them to demonstrate one of these so-called devices.

Now a self-possessed woman of twenty-one years, Gisela did not cry or try to run. The only hint I had that she knew she was about to die was a single glance of caring apology. Still, there was a hope of acceptance in her. How great a contribution would a witch have to make to be allowed to live? Carefully, by forge-light, she took a knife and then drew it across the palm of one of her smiths; following that, she placed a small rectangle of metal atop the wound. The press of a button caused it to whir, and, moments later, she removed it to show the Count that the cut had been cleaned and stitched with expert precision.

This could help our knights and their footmen survive a far greater range of wounds, she said, calmly enough that only I detected the tremble in her voice.

Brun was no fool. He was as smart and capable as Gis father had been, and, indeed, had supported his bid for power in the year before his death. In exchange, he had been given her hand in marriage, and had never spoken ill to her or mistreated her. He had simply been more focused on politics and power. I saw the forge-light reflected in his eyes, and I could not help but guess at the visions dancing in his mind. There was power here, he knew; power for more than simply healing.

I will never know what quiet words were exchanged, or the exact reasons for the action, but Brun drew his sword in a flash and felled one of the smiths. The other grabbed a weapon to avenge his blood-brother while Gi screamed at them to stop, but it was too late. Both scored mortal wounds, and Gi and I were left abruptly alone in the secret forge.

The bodies of the smiths were easy to take care of. Our household physician had already held counsel with us for many years, and now he helped me dispose of them. That part was simple. Explaining what had happened to the Count was the difficult task; for that, we kept everyone out of his chambers and staged an elaborate illness. We used Gis machine to heal his wound and keep him barely alive, and then she created the opposite of her fever reducer to instill sickness in him. Throughout, she kept her eyes down and her manner tense. There was no way to save the Counts life, but further torture hurt her as much as him. And yet, it had to be done. The Count died amid confusion and suspicion.

Quickly as we could, we called in all our favors with servants of other households. Whispering in the ears of their masters or trading calculated gossip, they helped hasten the new marriage of Gi to Ernest I. At the time, Gis younger brother ruled over the family Duchy, but, thanks to their marriage, Ernest would take over only two years later when that brother died childless. In such a manner, Gi and I returned home, but not without lingering trauma.

She had been injured inside by the sordid affair, but resolved to continue creating her machines in secret and helping others. She had two sons with Ernest, whom all considered a decent man, while spending most of the next five years delving ever deeper into the medical and mechanical arts. If she could have saved Bruns life, she would have, but she had simply lacked the ability. She resolved to change that.

Her creations took on a stranger, darker cast, and I regarded them with increasing concern. The wound-stitcher had been improved in design; no longer placed along the injury to close it, it now was a series of small spiky spheres that were dropped directly into an open cut *and left there*, healing and rebuilding from inside the person directly. I started to worry about Gi that first time that I watched the jagged things pull a long bleeding cut closed around themselves in a young boys leg. Would the devices somehow dissolve on their own, or would they remain there for the rest of his life? What would happen if he was wounded in that same spot again?

Only five years into her second marriage, Ernest and several members of his court found out. He loved her dearly, and protected herand for that, his courtiers killed him on a hunting trip, making it look like an accident the same way we had once done to Brun.

We did not flee. That night was the first time I had seen Gi cry in many years. With her obsession and curse, she had not spent as much time with Ernest as a husband and wife might have, but I was startled to see that she had grown to love him nonetheless. Out of concern for those murderous courtiers coming for her, and out of righteous anger, she crossed into the dark arts a second time and built her first machine specifically designed to inflict pain rather than assuage it.

It was a derivative of the small spiked balls that healed wounds from the inside, but it used that function very differently. The spheres lay on the floor like caltrops, but with a tendency for their spikes to stick to clothing and fleshand *unknit* skin and muscle instead of stitching it. When the murderers came for her and I in her chambers, she cast these across the floor, and shed tears at the horrific consequences of her dark creation. 

The courtiers survived, but would each live on maimed. There was no helping it now; her secret was most certainly out. Some childhood hope had died in her, and she chose not to deny the accusations. Several contingents of very powerful men from the Church, backed by holy troops, arrived to deal with the suddenly-public affair. It was clear to everyone that she would be burned at the stake, but that only served as a rallying cry.

For a decade or more, Gis devices had been helping people, and now, given understanding and focus, the people she had been secretly caring for came forward. All across the land, whole families made pilgrimage. Mothers showed off their healthy babes, fathers showed grievous scars that should have killed them but did not, landlords talked of improved sanitation and crops, and statisticians gave speeches about the surprising health and prosperity of the lands under Gis influence.

And, at my constant encouragement, Gi began playing politics for the first time in her life. Shed had a great many years to study the pieces and persons in play, and had seen the consequences of success and failure throughout her life. Most of all, the throngs of commoners who came to plead on her behalf healed some part of her hurt darkness. With all her confident and calculating strength back in play, instead of being burned at the stake, she managed to secure a marriage to what would become the love of her life.

Conrad was a friend and ally to the Church, and often received as much power in return as he gave them. He was also an ambitious man, and hoped to use his marriage to Gi to gain the Duchy and make a greater bid, but the Emperor intervened on behalf of other power-seekers. The subsequent political conflict resulted in Conrads exile, and we were forced, yet again, to leave home.

She tried to make the best of it, but I could tell the repeated loss of her home was taking its toll. She finally broke down after bearing Conrad a son; with our family still living in exile, the event was bitter rather than joyous. She resolved to give her son better than he had been dealt.

Furious at the constant damage that political machinations had inflicted on her life and the lives of her children, Gi studied and worked harder than ever. The world at large knew of her now as the Good Witch of Swabia, despite her exile from there, and she used that unique awe to publicly produce new creations that focused on economic rather than medical concerns.

On her thirtieth birthday, she took me into town, and showed me the great factory being built with her machines. The massive grey stone building looked every bit a modified cathedral, and, indeed, it was a church to a new kind of faith.

All my life, Ive been terrified of public perception, Gi told me, walking me through the vast arrays of metal and steam powered by the nearby river. But do you know my greatest strength? It was always in the books that you brought to me. I learned the workings of the world, and of nature, from written words in a scientific text. Families learn the values they should live by from written words in a religious text. I see no reason why the two should differ.

Wary, but proud of her strength of will, I asked, These machines are meant to produce books?

Yes, Gi said, looking up with hopeful and hard eyes at her vast mechanisms. Ive convinced Conrad that he who controls public perception controls the world. Were going to use the family wealth to produce papers and books and spread them far and wide.

What is your goal? I asked.

I will not stop until our family is safe from the random ire and ignorance of humanity, she said, caressing the letters of a printing press and touching their ink to a naked page. I will not stop until Conrad becomes Emperor, and I become Empress.

It was not outside the bounds of possibility, but the sentiment still stunned me. Never before had Gi expressed a wish for power, but now she had truly come to understand how the lack of it had left her vulnerable to, as she had put it, the random ire and ignorance of humanity.

Pushing forward through the seasons with fierce focus, she brought her machines to all aspects of life for those around her; machines dug better sewer systems, machines helped plow the fields, and machines produced newspapers and books that spread word of such wonders far and wide, exactly as she had intended.

I found it wondrous how quickly the Emperor reconsidered our exile. With Gis growing power, former petty conflicts vanished. More than that, the Emperor himself was beginning to reach middle age, and he quietly tasked her with investigating the extension of life and youth.

By then, I was also getting a bit older, and I think she might have done it more for me than for him. It was all about tiny particulates, she claimed, and how their lengthy chained interactions formed the basis for the entire construction of our bodies. Her sciences were far beyond my ken, but I trusted her, even as I saw her begin to burn brighter than any womanor man for that mattershould have.

She took on active roles in politics, attending councils, trading favors, and playing the game. She worked all hours of the night on her machines, and acquired and read all manner of exotic tomes from lands to the east. With their chemical and technological understanding added to her own, she first concocted an expensive daily formula that she claimed would slow aging. The Emperor could afford the cost, as could she, and he and I were the first to imbibe it.

I remember that vial. It was filled with cloudy yellow liquid of a disgusting colour and weight, but I did not want to age and die, if only because it would leave Gi alone in a world that seemed intent on hurting her and driving her to ever growing forcefulness. She bore no more children in these years, perhaps avoiding it on purpose, or perhaps too stressed for her health to allow it, and she sometimes cried in my arms before getting up and going to another council or meeting with foreign merchants.

Conrad and Gi had been married for about seven years when her fiery pace finally took its toll. She miscalculated a new improvement to our life-extension liquid, and I fell seriously ill around Easter of that year. At my side, she worked for four turns of the Sun to make a device that would save me; far away in his palace at Gttingen, the Emperor was not so fortunate.

Hed kept the liquid secret, so none knew what had killed him. The court physician there believed that he had died of a urinary tract infection, so no foul play was suspected.

I took a walk through our old homelands the week that Conrad was elected King of Germany. The quiet hamlets that I myself remembered as a girl were now bustling cities filled with Gis creations, or derivatives thereof. The streets were pristine. Merchants rode in carts that rolled themselves along without the need for horses. Freed from excessive toil, farmers spent a good deal of their day in the town square discussing philosophical and scientific ideas they had read in the bevy of new books being printed. I saw women dressed in fineries fit for a noblewoman, but which had cost very little thanks to new textile factories producing wonderful clothing for all.

So close by her side, I had seen each of Gis inventions, but I had not held witness to their spreading effect. Civilization was transforming through the fruits of her mind, and I had no doubt something momentous was about to happen. I held a concern in my soul: her works had not always been grand. I promised myself I would do my best to keep her focused on the path of Good.

After only three years of Kingship in the Germanic lands, in 1027, Conrad became Holy Roman Emperor. With such a wife at his side, what other result could there have been? Every season, new wonders spread from Conrads household. The cure for dysentery came in the form of a small chunk of medicine, called a pill, for which one dose would save a life. New cross-bred types of wheat were gifted to farmers, whose yields subsequently rose by half. The advent of certain bars of chemicals similar to lye halted the spread of disease all across the land as children were taught to wash their hands. Gi now wrote to the populations of many countries directly in the form of ongoing books, and she explained that many illnesses were actually caused by extremely tiny animals attacking the structures of the body.

It sounded crazy to me, and I wondered if her power was changing the scientific basis of the world itself, but the soap strategy worked. Infections dropped, dirt fell away, and the world became a bit brighter.

The first assassination attempt came from the East. The sudden prosperity of the Roman Empire had caught the fearful eye of the Song Dynasty. We should have expected it. Gi was beloved by all in her lands, but the rest of the civilized world held nothing but fear and contempt for her machines. Their first assassination attempt failed to reach Gi; it reached me instead.

For weeks I lay in the thrall of their poison, and, for weeks, she turned her efforts once more to the extension of life. I should have died outright, but her strange yellow liquid held many properties of health and stasis, and it had been keeping Gi, Conrad, and myself younger than was our right for years. With that advantage, I lay in fevered pain until Gi brought me a panacea.

That was what it was, in fact: a panacea. In her grief-filled solitude, not knowing what poison had nearly felled me, she had labored to create a cure for all poisons. The strange power inside her had provided exactly what she had sought.

In response to the assassination attempt, Gi sent the Emperor in Bianjing a single vial and a note. I was never told what was written, but I did hear that the ailing Emperor suddenly become hale and hearty, and I was certainly there for the announcement that the entire Chinese Empire had sworn fealty to the Holy Roman Empress and Emperorin that order. The news shook the civilized world.

To his credit, Conrad did not take offense. He and Gi had been through many political conflicts; uprisings, plays for power, and negotiations had all been won through by mutual trust and Gis hidden strength. Emperor of the World seemed to be a high enough title for him, and he loved her besides, and did not resent it as her star rose to eclipse his.

In a blink, a century passed. I treasure that time still. Stable, wonderful, and peaceful, those years were everything I knew Gi deserved, and she shared them with the world. Steam, coal, electricity, andmuch laternuclear power grew in grids across lands that had been rough and wild in the year of her birth. With the opportunity to truly watch the decades pass, I saw roads spread like flowers in bloom. Villages sprang up like fungus after a rain. Separate towns became single cities.

Gi began making plans for technologies even she had not invented yet. She understood how they might work, but knew that we lacked the infrastructure to support them, so she laid foundations for those new devices until such time as they became feasible. Her sight became distant, as if she were seeing less and less of those around her, and more and more of what they would become. Without meaning to, she took on an air of mysticism to her followers and citizens, and they held a surprise coronation for her. At the height of summer in 1139, by the unified consent of over two hundred million men and womenmore or less the adult population of the planet, all spreading the idea over papers and telegrams in a fit of worshipping celebrationshe was crowned Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind.

These were the happiest years of her life, as I witnessed them. Any and all were permitted to come to court and speak on their problems, and she sent them home with a device that might help, or designs for one if none could be procured immediately. There were no wars under her rule, for there were no covetous desires. If one wanted gold, one had only to employ a machine to dig it up. If one wanted fine spices, one had only to ride a train to the East and partake. If one wanted love, it was taught that one had only to become a better person, and it would come.

But a creeping chill slipped into Giselas life as the years rolled on. The mothers and children she had helped all her life grew old and died. The soldiers she had saved on the battlefields with her devices grew old and died. Her own children grew old, had children of their own, and died. She was already feeling that hurt when the worst happened. I was the first to notice Conrads tendency to daydream, but thought nothing of it. As the seasons rotated and his distraction grew worse, Gi took notice, and came out of her mystical distance to painfully and tearfully search for a cause and a cure. Nothing worked. There was no issue with Conrads brain, and he refused to speak on his inner thoughts. In desperation, Gi sent out men the world over, only to find that the world held no solutions for her beloveds descent into trance.

That was when I first guessed that her power might be limitless. She grew depressed, and then furious, and demanded an answer from existence itself. I was in the gardens with her when she shook her fist at empty space and spoke with absolute cosmic rage. If this world holds no answer, *give me one that will!*

At first, I was afraid that the planet might change around us. What devastating consequences might her wish have? But the world did not change: the mobile walls of the garden did. Their metal, wires, and electricity bent, traveled into her sight, and changed before us. Yes! I remember her screaming. That might actually work!

She knew what she was building. The plans had come to her: the solution to the ultimate puzzle. By sheer force of will, the machine began to build itself on the ground in front of us. Everything prior in her life had been crafted by her own two hands, or by others with her designs. This was the first Id ever seen of her creations creating themselves. I believed her sorrow, anger, and century of knowledge were deep enough to make this possible, but the sight still terrified me to my core.

The machine she had envisioned looked simple enough. It channeled the power grid into several wide metal circles which rotated around a central seat; but the depths of the machine below were unknown to me. Completely drained of energy, and covered in sweat, Gi gripped my arm for support and called for the Captain of her Guard. The man loved her in his own way, as many did, and did not hesitate when she ordered him into the machine.

It was only after he had goneafter he had disappeared in a violent tunnel of purple and white boring down into the earththat I asked her how he was meant to return.

She grew even paler then, and spent the last of her will forming an intricate small square chip of metal. I had no idea how it functioned, but she told me it would allow me to find my way back with him. She collapsed then, and I brought her to her yellow-tapestried Throne Room where many physicians rushed to her aid. In the meantime, she had entrusted me with a sacred task.

I sat in the same chair that her Captain had, and I watched the garden spin to dizzying speed around me. In moments, the purple and white glow tunneled down, and I was cast free into blasting sands.

He hadnt wandered far. I found him, clutched his arm, and pressed down on the chip that Gi had given me. I felt that same vortex beginning to spin up to speed around us, and I knew we would be saved. I took that moment to look up. Through the whipping desert sands, I saw the sky.

It was fully near noon, and bright red.

We werent just somewhere else on the planet. Gi had desired a world that could provide her a solution, and her power had made it happen. As my eyes came down, and as the light grew to full intensity, I locked eyes with a wanderer on a distant dune. He did not seem as shocked as he should have been.

The light cast us back into the garden, and I swore the Captain to secrecy, to which he agreed with wide and horror-filled eyes. We locked the mobile wallswhat was left of themand let none into the gardens. This device was beyond any mortal understanding. Only Gi could instruct us further.

But, rushing up to her chambers, I was told the news that she had fallen ill and could not wake.

That night, while mankind held its breath, the wanderer I had seen in that unknown desert walked into our court. He was dressed mildly and simply in brown clothes, and had only a walking stick and enough supplies to survive. He pulled a brown cloth down from around his mouth, and I saw that he appeared to be a rather handsome man of about forty. He and I would later be wed and have four children together, but that is another story.

He sat and asked for water, and I nodded approval, for I was Gis personal caretaker in all regards, including her palatial household. While he sat at one end of her luxurious yellow dining table, I dismissed everyone else, sat beside him, and quietly asked him how he had come to arrive here.

He smiled, lifted a hand, and opened a ghostly blue oval in the air with his hand. It showed onto a beautiful pasture for but a moment before he closed it, but I understood. Whatever Gi had done, this man could also do, at least in this specific regard. Im an exile, he said, taking a swig of water.

I know something about that, I told him.

Was yours by choice? he asked.

I shook my head.

Ah, well, I just didnt fit in. He traced his gaze across the very air. Theres something amiss in this house. Ive been here before, and I dont think I remember your kind being quite so dismal.

The Lady Gisela is bedded, unable to wake. I grabbed his rugged hand. She wished for a world that might provide some form of healing for her husband, but now she, too, has fallen ill.

He rubbed the left side of his beard. I wouldnt be able to help unless it was something mental.

My heart leapt in my chest. It might be.

He stood. Take me to them.

I remember that walk in detail. Every silent moment is etched into my memories. Down the yellow-tiled hall, up a set of steps, and through the quarters to her chambers, where Gi and Conrad were each in their own separate bed. Physicians stood in surprise, but I waved them off.

The wanderer approached Gi first, his manner awed. He lifted her eyelid once, touched her wrist, and then looked at me. Do you know what this woman is?

I nodded.

All three of you, he murmured. Your minds are bigger than they should be.

Not sure what to make of that comment, I watched as he sat with Gi, held her hand, closed his eyes, and began to meditate. After nearly an hour, he finally broke away and stood. Shell be fine. Shes just pulled a muscle, so to speak. He walked over to Conrads bed and frowned. Theres nothing wrong with him.

What? I rushed to his side, but Conrad still stared absently at the ceiling, unresponsive to any prompt. Hes in a trance.

No, his mind is fully operational, the wanderer replied. He simply chooses not to respond, as far as I can tell. He looked around the luxurious room. Is there somewhere I can stay? I feel that I might be in good company here, and Ive had enough of wandering alone for the moment.

I provided a room for him, of course, and then took my leave to sit by my ladys side once more. I prayed for her health, but our strange visitor had said she would recover, and thoughts of his power and mystery distracted me besides. I fell asleep without realizing it, only to awaken alongside Gi as she sat up and retched onto very expensive carpet.

She was weak, but demandedwith hopeto know what I had found. I told her of the wanderer staying in the north wing, and she insisted on visiting him immediately. Her body refused to cooperate, so we brought him to her after someone had dealt with the soiled carpet.

Back in her chambers for a second time, he seemed wary. No, my lady, he told Gi. I cannot heal that man. Your wish may have been falsely fulfilled, or, perhaps you were given me as a way to find my people.

Your people? she asked, breathless with restrained excitement. Her long blonde hair was matted with sweat, but she didnt seem to care. It was more lively and animated than I had seen her in quite some time. There are more like you?

He shrugged. I havent been with them in a long timewere quite different, you seebut there are many far more skilled than I. I can pick a language out of your head, travel where I see fit fairly well, and cook a mean stew. But the others dont prefer this form. They dont embrace it like I do. They think Im a little bit off.

Thus the exile, Gi said, understanding. Still, will you take us to them? You have a place here with us either way.

Against everything else he could have thought of in that moment, he looked at me, and then quickly back at her. Ill stay, your grace permitting. And Ill take you to them.

The hapless Captain of the Guard volunteered for his second trip to other worlds, of course, and returned some weeks later with a host of strange hermits. Clad in plain brown with less survival and fashion sense than my wanderer, they seemed ill at ease in their own bodies, and their presence gave most chills.

Gi asked them many questions, and discussed many issues in private. From what she later told me, a clear exchange was in order. She wanted them to help heal Conrad, and they... some sort of machine threat was overtaking their homelands, and they believed Gis incredible skill with engineering might provide a solution. There were *trillions* of their kind back home, a number which struck me as unbelievable, and an ordered evacuation of their scattered peoples would take hundreds of years. I didnt quite understand; how far apart were they scattered that they needed so long? But all they needed, she told me in secret, was something to delay the onslaught. She did them one better and offered a safe haven. Our world wasnt big enough on its own, but, putting their collective heads together, they came up with an incredible and daring solution.

Of course, you know how that alliance turned out. A great many wondrous works were undertaken in cooperation between two great civilizations. For the first time as far as anyone knew, an actual sanctuary against the threats of existence was created around our world and the many children branched from it to provide space for the newcomers.

But not even their greatest minds could help Conrad. The once-great man now sat staring at nothing through every hour of every day, and Gi began to despair. Everything in her life had been taken, won back, and taken from her again; Conrad and I had been the two constants, and now she was losing one of us.

When she finally realized the problem, she became inconsolable for a number of years. She dealt with things by shutting herself away and working on a device to make it better, but there was nothing that could heal this. My beloved wanderer had been right: Conrad had simply given up. Hed lived too long, seen too many things, and lost track of what it meant to care. Without caring, there was no action, no strength, and no growth.

I visited her after nobody had spoken to her in four years. She was still shut up in the basements of the palace, her yellow tapestries torn down in anger, and she stood drained and gaunt. I watched as she built a small device with her mind and then retched; the device sparked, and failed.

She collapsed in her own vomit, further sullying the already ruined yellow dress that had once been her favorite for dances with Conrad. Ill build a better immortality, she choked out. I swear it. The human mind wasnt built to live forever. But our allies can live for millennia. It *can* be done. The fault is in the strength of the soul, you see?

Holding her and weeping myself at her state, I shook my head.

I see it, she said quietly, her gaze distant through the years. Everything mankind might create around the breakthrough is in place, but the unknown elements remain. I could leave these plans in place for a thousand years, and we still might never find what we need. She fought with me, but I held her tight. I have to go!

Where? I asked her, desperate, already knowing the answer.

*Out there!* she said, consumed by that same fury that had first provided her a device to travel to other worlds. Somewhere out there, the regeneration capabilities I need exist. Its the soul, you see? Some creatures soul, some civilizations triumph, or some monstrous entity that sails the worlds on fins of gold. They have it, and we need it. And then, no one will die. No one will have to lose the people they love.

I didnt know what else to tell her. This obsession wasnt just for Conrad, but for all the mothers, fathers, children, soldiers, kings, and commoners she had ever helped. She had so loved helping, and yet they had all died in the end, merely through time itself. Someday.

We dreamt of it then, but we had no way of knowing that, hundreds of years later, her better immortality would come to fruition and still hold the same fundamental flaw: humanity. By then, it mattered little to either of us. I was dead, and she had lost all ability to see the truth. No matter how long she worked, no matter how many animals, plants, brains, and souls she studied, no matter how many worlds she scoured for clues, she would never succeed.

They had come late to the show, so to speak, but in time for the final offensive. That morning, reinforcements arrived.

Kendricks urgent order got them all packed up and ready in moments. Tents were stuffed away, bikes were readied, and they pulled up behind many other squadrons of men and women on bikes. Far to their left, crews even swarmed over a few tanks, preparing them. Kendrick had been busy buying friends with the last of their food throughout the night, and had gotten some sense of what was happening from the depressed chain of command, so only he was ready for their more uncommon support.

Endless legions of yellow-skinned believers armed with strange crystalline energy lances marched from horizon to horizon on either side of the base; all that was left of the Yngtak race, apparently, and all more than fanatically encouraged by the news Kendrick had brought that their home reality still existed.

Above, massive purple amethyst pyramids soared in from the horizon. Nobody had been able to communicate with them and tell them what was happening, but they had actively herded many lost troops this way nevertheless, and now waited above without attacking.

Randy tried not to look at the amethyst-filled sky. Multiple times now, theyd been harried by one such as those, and, multiple times now, her brain had been unable to make sense of its behavior. Now she knew: it had been purposely scaring them into certain rifts, herding them here fast enough to join the fight.

A menagerie of other lifeforms were present in many places, but strangest of all were the green titans; walking, lumbering, massive beasts hundreds of feet tall that seemed to be comprised entirely of carefully engineered plant matter. At these, Edgar gawked, and repeatedly expressed surprise that Even the Plant God is here!

Turning to them, Kendrick said quietly, Ive been through fights like this, and we dont want to stay. This isnt our war, because we simply have no idea what the truth is. Our goal is to look for an out and *take it.* Get out of this, get home somehow. He looked at Jen, but the blonde said nothing. His gaze shifted to Carmen, and the determined woman nodded back.

Randy said nothing, either, even though she knew Kendrick was wrong. In the bomb-riddled silence of the night, Jen had finally told her the truth.

As heavier snow began drifting down, Verene pulled up on a bike of her ownjade-trimmed, to match her full body armorand addressed them of her own accord. Are you ready? You *must* succeed in this.

You seem fairly lively this morning, Mona said, her scientific interest piqued.

I cant be lively, Verene responded, without a single lilt of emotionbut with a strange subtle energy in her words nonetheless. Im dead.

Dead. Randy heard that word, and it rang through her. She would have to tell Kendrick, and soon. He needed to know that their only chance was to fully commit to being part of this offensive; to roll the dice and pray for the best. There was no out. There was only forward. There was no going home; not now, not ever. Her Glorys nightmare ahead held a better chance of survival than the threat coming up behind. An icy breeze ran past her cheeks, and she shivered.

Still, she breathed deep to fight her anxiety and clenched her handlebars tight to stop trembling. There could be more days ahead. It was possible. She might even find out exactly what days those were, and what time it was. Yes, that was something to live for.

She stood among her beloved friends and watched as jets streaked forward to deliver the first offensive, and she, like the rest of humanity and Yngtak combined, stood in fearful awe as millions of black dots rose up to meet those harbingers of nuclear fire. This had never been the plan, not even according to those mysterious higher-ups who had placed Jennifer within their squad, but this hastily put-together alliance and attack would have to work. For this entire swath of the New Exodus Vanguardand for many others, too, human and nonhumanthis was the only shot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Randy Ellwood kept sweeping her vision back and forth as she rode; her eyes a tiring metronome of anxious wariness. All the possible paths ahead needed to be covered. All the potential vectors of attack needed to be checked often enough that nothing could sneak up on them. Her squadmates rode beside her, spread out in formation to keep their scouting and evasion ranges at maximum, but she still felt pressure weighing down on her. It was more up to her now that she could sense the formerly well-oiled mechanism the team had been developing friction. Once the parts stopped moving in perfect rhythm, it was only a matter of time.

The radio in her helmet continued to buzz with squad chatter.

But how can we trust *anything* theyve told us? Carmen asked, distraught.

Mona had a reply, but she wasnt exactly happy about it. The hunger of three hundred and fifty billion people cant be faked.

Come on, Edgar cut in. With First World technology, with the allies they have back home, with all those larger-than-life heroes running around saving and destroying worlds, they cant figure out *food?*

Randy gripped her handlebars tighter in a vain attempt to relieve her own stress. The terrain underneath her bike was oddsomething dark that resembled corrugated metal, upon which she vibrated horribly at any speed less than a break-neck forty-five miles an hourand the sky ahead held a sickly color. Across a vast open expanse of that unknown metal surface, the horizon held a blazing evening line of pea soup green that accented the lower limit of the cloudy grey dome overhead. Were the others too caught up in their argument to see this? Or had they just grown desensitized?

But the First World was destroyed, Bill radioed. And the land wasnt left in great shape by that final grey flood. Maybe they really do got nothin. Why would they send us out here like this unless it was important?

They hadnt talked much lately, as something had been weighing on the usually social blondes mind, but Randy knew Jennifer would be all about heading back. There was a *baby* to protect, after all, and Jen had been a nurse at one time. That wellspring of caring still existed within her.

Pixley sighed, letting her distant headshake become almost audible. We have to keep going. Its too important.

Her bike began vibrating painfully as the surprise caused her to slow down. Why had Jen taken the exact opposite position shed expected? Something dark clouded Randys vision as the pieces began moving in the shadowed portions of her mind. It was a good mind; an anxious mind that liked to recalculate, redesign, and revolve endlessly over tasks. It tended to repeat itself, but she chose to like her mind for its strengths rather than despise it for the negatives she let no one else see. Optimismthat was the power. Lets just get out of this drab place, and Im sure the next reality will be better.

Far to her right, beyond Bills yellow-trimmed dot, she saw Carmen slow. No, she said, with that fierce undertone that meant she was deadly serious. It wont be better. Every world out here is worse than the last. The whole multiverse is a sea of raging Hells.

Bill also began slowing, and Randy called for the others in distress. She turned and rode over to Carmen while six other dust trails on corrugated metal circled back around to meet them.

The olive-skinned woman had stopped entirely and taken her helmet off. She remained on her bike, but stood somewhat above it, her expression heavy. Pulling up next to her and Bill, Randy swiftly took off her helmet and tried to assess her squadmates state before the others arrived. Carmen but she had no idea what to say to make the situation better. Beside her, Bill waited with his shoulders low.

Kendrick was the first to pull up and stop, and his front wheel threw bits of rust up from the strange ground. He stood, removed his helmet, and simply watched Carmen with open hands and an expression of apology. He, too, knew there was no changing her mind.

One by one, the rest of the bikes came to a stop, each giving that same subtle sound of sloshing rust. One by one, each helmet came off, but no one spoke.

Weve made it this far, Carmen said, her tone despairing but firm. She looked to each of them. But weve gotten far luckier than we deserve. Even then, look at us. Edgar, your wrists are all sliced up. Bill, we had to cut pieces of your hand out, and only the Lord knows what you went through mentally. Lian, youve been shaved, beaten, autopsied, *choked*. Randy At that, Randy jumped a little. What had *she* been through? You might not remember it, Carmen continued. But you did work obsessively for decades, in some other life we cant know, to free us all from that strange warped beach.

Randy wanted to say, *I do tend to get obsessive,* but she thought better of interrupting.

Mona, youve been sliced and tortured by your own squadmate. Kendrick, you had half your body ripped out while I held your bike up. *I saw those machines take your ribs.* Despite her stone will, Carmens eyes began misting. And Cheng, oh Chengyou had to throw a nuclear bomb into another world singlehandedly. Youve still got the burns.

Glancing over quickly, Randy wondered where those remaining burns might be, since she couldnt see them.

Theres not a one of us thats alright, Carmen said, fighting back tears of dismay and anger. If I knew for sure that everything depended on us, if I still had that faith, in those who organized usor in God, after what Ive seen out herethen I would ride off the end of the world itself. If it was just me. But its not. Its not just me anymore. She took a deep breath, and finally said the words: We have to go home.

All eyes turned to Kendrick. He seemed at a loss, but tried anyway. I cant make any of you stay. Were not really military, and Im not really your Captain.

At that, Randy stepped forward and touched her friends forearm in support.

Kendrick looked down at her, gave a weak smile of thanks, and said, Stand with me if youre staying. Stand with Carmen if youre going. No shame either way. He fought down a shuddering breath of anger and defeat. I care about all of you, and I cant say that well succeed

No, Edgar interrupted, sending his piercing gaze across the gathered group. We all understood the risks when we signed on for this. That speech they gave about statisticsdid we all really have the delusion that *we* would be the small handful that would survive? Out of a million men sent into total chaos? No, Kendrick, dont just let this happen. Thats not the man I met in that truck on that bright morning. Make your case.

Cheng rolled his bike across the gap and stood with Carmen, but he did turn and salute. My choice is made for me, but please still make your case to the rest of our squadto this family of exiles we have built together. Its not right to sunder it without a fight. He thought of one more thing. *Sir.*

Watching him, Randy was glad to see his freedom from numbness had not abated. Chengs face held emotion now, in subtle ways that made him seem more alive, and she was glad for that despite what was happening. Cheng was a stalwart man, and nice. Carmen was a tough woman whose inner strength somehow seemed natural for a mother. They both deserved safety and happiness.

Her gaze then shifted to Jennifer, who stood stricken behind a mask of worried neutrality. Studying that mismatch of inner and outer emotion, Randys pulse quickened, and her curious brain began madly trying new and unknown pieces against the facts she already had.

Kendrick nodded a few times at some inner thought, and then he half-heartedly lifted his head a little higher. Were almost to half fuel, he finally said. Thats when were turning around anyway, right?

That actually caught their attention.

Please, lets stick together, and then well *all* go home. Its safer that way, right?

It wasnt technically accurate, Randy knew, because their gas mileage had been increasing due to the decreasing weight of the remaining fuel itselfbut she wasnt about to chime in and tell everyone that the halfway point was probably closer to thirty percent.

No, Carmen said after a moment, shaking her head. No. That next one could be the death of us all. Theres no telling. *Just one more* is too dangerous, let alone just a few more. Stand with me, or stand with Kendrick. We cant waste time.

Something within Randys stomach seemed to fall. She hadnt expected that response at all. Still standing with Kendrick, she waited and watched. Gazes shot all around as men and women tried to guess what everyone else was thinking.

With a lowered bald head, Lian spoke first. I cannot return. Not the way that I am. There are forces out here that may potentially fix me. Failing that, I intend to die rather inflict myself upon others again. She rolled her bike closer to Kendrick to affirm her choice.

Grim-faced, Bill crossed the gap and joined her, bike and all. She quietly took his hand and waited.

Looking repeatedly at Jennifer, Mona finally said, Someone medical has to go with Carmen, just in case. And God forbid they dont make it back to medical care in time. She crossed the rusted earth with her cycle and stood with Carmen and Cheng, bringing their number to three. She turnedand tried not to look at Edgar.

They might need computer skills, Edgar said weakly, his stance pained.

Kendrick reached out and gripped his shoulder. Edgar, you were my first friend since I lost my family, so Im gonna tell you this straight up: dont be an idiot. Go.

Hiding his torn expression, he, too, trekked across the rust. Distracted, he almost let his bike fall at the end, but he remembered the kickstand just in time. Nobody said a word about what would have otherwise been a hilarious moment of physical embarrassment. The lack of response only made the tension higher.

And, still, Randy couldnt help but run her thoughts over and over Jens odd silence. All eyes fell on the blonde now as she became the last to make her choice. Mona had made her decision taking the hint that Jen would staywould her crossing the gap, too, bring Edgar and Mona back to this side? The palpable tension and wounded pain in the air seemed to find tangible form on Jens face.

Visibly unable to bear it any longer, she said with an almost blatant fury: We cant go back.

Something subtle changed in Kendricks expression.

Randy saw this, and saw the blondes behavior for all its shape. Only a very few specific terrible things would fit that puzzle piece. Jenwhats going on?

We cant go back, Pixley responded, fierce. None of us.

Another push would do it. Randy summoned up all the fiery attitude her red hair had long imbued her with. *Jen! Tell us whats going on!*

The blonde finally cracked. Her face turned red with some highly charged inner emotion, and she began to speak.

At that moment, a humming that had been growing for quite some time soared overhead into a full-fledged roar, and the squad stared up in unison as a familiar machine raced by overhead. A circle of shadow held a bird-like grey shell in the air. They watched it fly toward the sickly green horizon with stares of confusion, horror, and hope. The sight jarred Randy right out of her mental spinnings.

A helicopter? Bill asked, dumbfounded.

Thats one of ours! Edgar shouted. Its got our symbol!

Goaded into action, Kendrick stopped staring and shouted at his squadmates: After it!

In mere moments, they were on their bikes and speeding after the shrinking helicopter on the horizon. Shot through with adrenaline, Randy felt at one with her body in a rare way. Her hands gripped the bikes handlebars with precision, and she kicked into higher gears in a desperate attempt to catch up with the New Exodus helicopter.

Chopper in flight, please respond, Kendrick radioed repeatedly. Chopper in flightplease respond! Whats the situation? Weve got ten bikes on the ground here. Chopper in flight, please respond!

Might already be out of range, Edgar responded. Or they could be flying silent on orders.

To her right, Randy saw Mona turn her helmeted head to look at Edgar. Or, they might be ignoring us.

In any case, the squad rode on at top speed.

---

We had no idea what we were going to find ahead of us. Where was that helicopter going? Where had it even come from? Most of all: could they tell us what time it was? Its been gnawing away at me ever since Bills beach. I dont like not knowing exactly what day and time it is. It makes things fuzzy.

I was preoccupied with the thought of everyone splitting up, but I still should have known something was wrong when the next rift came up grey.

The world beyond was unlike anything Id ever seen. Spindly, ferrous, like someone had drawn magnets in grand patterns across the ground and up into the sky to form spiky lattices of metal. Thing is, this metal wasnt cold and lifeless. It pulsed underneath with a strange latent vitality.

I didnt like it. Not one bit. Everything felt wrong, especially the New Exodus base we came across.

---

It wasnt just Randy. The entire squad pulled into the remarkable swath of normalcy with wary eyes, their helmets clutched close in case a quick exit proved necessary.

The walls were military-issue corrugated metal, and had been hastily set up and interlocked to protect an irregular L-shaped area that held maybe twenty or thirty large tents and numerous munitions stacks. The gate had been swung inward to admit them, and then closed behind; but none of the men running to and fro stopped to greet them or explain what was happening.

For something *was* happening. Exhausted men splattered with rust and blood ran to various places on the walls firing automatic weapons at a desperate pace. Above the gate behind them, a single soldier let fire a rocket-propelled grenade, and the explosion rang out a moment later somewhere on the track they had just followed in.

Overhead, another helicopter passed at high speed. Some of the men paused briefly to flip it off.

Following this, the worried eyes of the squad turned to Kendrick, who picked his best guess at a command tent and led them toward it. A shower of rust and purple ooze from sources unknown splashed the tent, but Randy ducked inside just in time to avoid any dripping. The last of her squad to enter, she gave one last look to the beleaguered base and then closed the fabric behind her.

Within, the air was hazybut not from gunsmoke. Several older men in ranking uniforms sat around a war table smoking from a pipe that emanated the very distinctive odor of marijuana.

What the hell is this? Cheng muttered, shifting in the small space next to her.

Kendrick stared at his likely superiors. Whos in charge here?

One of the men laughed for a long moment, and then coughed.

Too anxious to remain in back, Randy pushed forward. What day is it?

The man who had laughed and coughed looked at his wrist, but a paler band showed an empty spot where his watch had been.

One of the other men passed the pipe and asked, You guys from the Vanguard?

Yes, Kendrick said, his firmness momentarily masking his growing disgusted anger.

Jesus, how slow were you guys going? the man asked with a congenial smile and half-closed eyes. Youre definitely late to the show. At that, he brought out a syringe.

Kendrick gave a wordless order, and the squad backed out of the tent. At his side, Randy was the last, and shut the tents fabric again. She looked up to her friend and Captain, aghast.

From this angle, it was apparent that there were far more men in this base than they had first seen from the entrancemen lying in corners, men smoking in fox holes made of supply crates, and men sitting and staring up at the metal-tendril-filled sky and the waste yellow starting to appear from behind vomitous green clouds.

Edgar saw that disgusting yellow and shrank in his boots. If I remember the stories right, I think the brain-eaters come from a world with this color sky.

Hey! Kendrick shouted, trying to get the attention of men on the walls.

Too focused on firing over the walls at enemies unknown, none paid him any heed.

You! Kendrick said, fierce, to a smiling man lying in a corner. What the hell is going on here?

The man rubbed his hand through his long greasy brown hair and grinned. I saw the bikes. Vanguard guys. You find any weapons that might help? Any big fuckin lasers? Maybe some food? No? Ah, the hell with ya. He closed his eyes.

Is everybody here crazy? Carmen asked, prepared and wary.

Lian shook her head. I dont feel any different.

There was nothing to do but make their own decisions. Checking out the supply crates, they found all manner of weapons, ammunition, and waterbut no food. Nobody from the base seemed to care that they were looting, so Kendrick quietly ordered them all to stock up.

Choosing a hefty weapon that reminded her of an AK-47, Randy slung it over her back and took as many ammo clips for it as she could carry in her bikes cargo.

We havent been trained with these, Bill told them. So dont use them unless you have to, and, then, keep them pointed well away from all of us. And expect a ton of kickback.

Well try these out in the barren areas, Kendrick agreed, still watching the crazed men running around on the walls. Id be inclined to join this fight, whatever the hell it is, but weve got bigger concerns at the moment. He looked over at Carmen as he spoke, and she thanked him with a silent nod in return.

Too, Kendrick found a new uniform. He ducked behind a crate to change out of his severely ripped and burned clothes, and came out looking like a new man. He couldnt help but pat down the crisp fabric, and Randy decided to encourage him with a thumbs up that only made him a little embarrassed.

One last thing, Randy told herself. She needed to return a missing part to the engine that was the group. Grabbing an extra handheld radio, she gave it to Lian to replace the one the girl had dropped back on Amber Two. Lian thanked her and attached it to her belt.

Moving through the human-populated base as if it was enemy territory, the nine of them rolled their bikes and kept lookout for any change in behavior around thembut none came. Climbing up on top of the gate, Cheng reported a clear road ahead.

And it was clear, for all the firing from the men on the walls. It looked as if many large caravans had gone this way; the rust and grey had all been pushed to the sides, leaving ruts for them to ride along.

After the tension back at that inexplicable base, it was strangely terrifying to return to the quiet and the simple roar of their collective engines. Randy kept her eyes sweeping back and forth, and her heart rate ran higher than safe levels. The spiky and pulsing terrain seemed to be growing even as they raced through it; spindles arched up and connected to one another, and delicate lattices began thickening in the sky.

Contrary to the stated desire to test fire their weapons, they kept riding, and none dared stop in this strange growing biomechanical wasteland. As a new wall appeared on the distant horizon, a flight of ten helicopters roared by, heading straight for that same destination.

Maybe well get some goddamn answers, Kendrick muttered.

Randy wasnt sure if hed meant to radio that, and nobody else responded. Their focus was all on the strange landscape, and making sure no threats appeared unspotted.

This time, Kendrick radioed ahead. Although he got no response, the gates of this larger metal-walled base opened quickly enough that they didnt have to stop until they came fully into the inner staging area.

Here, many more tents and piles of supply crates were present, and Randy thought she saw several boats docked to a foul silver river in the distance. On the walls, many teams of men constantly reloaded mortars, firing them at distant unknown targets. Ahead, one of the helicopters that had passed them was just landing, and men rushed to it and around it.

Grabbing a passing man, Kendrick gripped him by his ragged uniform. What is all this?

The man grinned at him with bloodshot eyes. Its the end, man. Were all dead.

Dead?

Eager for an answer, Randy cut in. What time is it?

Who cares? This is as far as any of us go. He pulled away and ran off.

Kendrick sighed angrily. Randy glanced over at Jen in dismay, but the blonde looked away to hide her strange expression.

I dont like this, Edgar commented. We need to find someone who hasnt lost it, and fast.

Agreed. Kendrick led the way further among the crowds of hurrying men.

It was Randy who spotted him. Over there!

Greeting a landing helicopter, their pepper-haired drill sergeant looked rust-blasted and tired, but alive. He turned and shouted something upon seeing them, but then ran over with a hand on his hat to escape the noise of the helicopters blades above. You guys made it! he shouted. When you didnt show up, I thought you all died! Im so glad you all made it. He counted their numbers. Oh.

Clints alive, Kendrick told him. Just not with us.

That brought a slight relief to the older mans features. Alright. So whereve you been?

Held up.

Randy couldnt help herself. What time is it?

Ellwood, he said with a smile. Good to see you. He lifted his watchand frowned. Its broken

Its important, Kendrick said, supporting her request. We may have lost some time in a time loop.

The older man slung his small pack around and began rooting through it. Let me just get my journal. Well get you sorted. It

The cycling whine of an alarm interrupted him, and he turned his head roughly to stare at the horizon to the west.

Along with her squadmates, Randy followed his gaze, only to see a strange biomechanical horror approaching. It held the aspect of a floating continent, of a mountain of rust and metal floating in waste yellow, and tremendous jumbled snow-flake like spindles and spikes ran out from it in every direction save the top. Still distant, it began releasing clouds of black dots.

Son of a bitch, their former instructor growled. He turned back to them, and his eyes fell on their new guns. Ditch those things. Theyll be useless against these. Ive got sapphire rifles for you.

Seriously? Edgar asked, delighted, but he quickly donned a grim expression again as he saw the others were tense and silent.

The first crate proved to be empty, and the grizzled older man did not look happy. Theres no time. Theyre coming in from the west; well hold them off. They could use some reinforcements deeper in. You nine should go north, give them some fresh strength.

Kendrick gripped the mans forearm. Sir. What is going on?

Follow, he said shortly, leading themand their bikesacross the base to a boat. He spoke as they ran and rolled. Her Glory is waking.

Her Glory? Edgar chimed in. Never heard of her.

You will, the older man said gruffly. Shes a Class Two reality bender. Shes been the primary threat out here in these wastelands for centuries, held off only by tenuous alliances and no-conflict treaties, but the Devastation killed her and scattered her empire into pieces.

Randy looked back at Jen, but she could tell nothing from the blondes concerned expression.

If shes dead, how is she waking? Carmen asked as she ran and rolled her bike to Randys right.

Beyond me, their instructor said. Shes got bio-machines beyond anything we could imagine. She literally shapes reality to make them possible. Theyve probably been hard at work resurrecting her.

Carmen seemed mortified by the thought of a monster with the ability to resurrect. Cant we just go around? Or go home?

The older man shook his head as he reached the boat and began indicating places where they could lock their bikes into place. Have you seen all the empty realities between home and here? Her machines have cleaned them all out; brought all life to her inner sanctums for God knows what purpose.

That horrible machine reality Kendrick breathed, rubbing his right forearm.

And those damn bugs that bit me, Bill realized, suddenly pained all over again.

Edgar murmured a third connection. Yngtak was empty

Worse, he continued. She controls many of the rifts in this region. Shes been funneling us all here. First and second wave alike. Theres no going back, and theres no going past, unless we can destroy her before she wakes.

Suddenly, the supplies, bases, and munitions made sense to Randy. The second wave is here?

He nodded even as the last bike was locked into place on the surface of the wide, low boat. I told Cheng there He nodded, and received a nod in return. the second wave would be armed with something a little stronger. Youll see. Good luck, kids. Give that bitch hell. With that, he pushed them off from the edge of the weird silver river, going knee deep without pain or incident.

Randy wasnt sure why, but this parting seemed even more painful than the first had been, way back before all the pain and riding. Maybe it was because she doubted she would ever see him again, or maybe it was because she already hadnt expected to, and this had been a blessed surprise. Fighting back tears, she raised a salute to the pepper-haired man on the shrinking beach behind them. Eight others saw her and did the same, and, on that distant shore, their former drill sergeant stood tall and saluted back. He waited in exactly that pose, proud, until the curve of the river took him out of sight.

---

The rivers not mercury. Thats a relief, at least. None of us can really figure out what it is, not even Mona, but our best guess is water with a ton of metal particles in it. Were not going to drink it, regardless.

I still wish I knew what time it was.

Weve been on this river for over twenty-four hours. This barf yellow and green sky at least follows the normal rules of night and day; I took watch at night, but theres not much to see except the passing thirty-foot spires. I wonder if they are growing in sync with Her Glory, whoever she is. Is this world her brain? Are these spires her neural dendrites?

But what time is it? Maybe this place *doesnt* follow the normal rules of night and day. What if its a twenty-five or twenty-six hour day? How would we know? Damnit!

Helicopters keep passing overhead, all going north. We even saw a jet. The second wave must have been much better equipped than we were. Or did word of this threat get back to humanity? Is this a full military offensive being waged thousands of miles distant from home? We hear gunfire in the distance, and bombs at all hours. We are mostly invisible under these spires

---

Her journal entry cut off by the sight of something coming up along the night-bound river, Randy shouted to her squadmates. Having slept in the open air and not in their tents, they were up and ready in a flash, guns pointed at the long tentacle emerging from star-glittering silver. 

Kendrick called it, and nine automatic weapons fired, giving them each their first test.

The kickback *was* greater than Randy had expected, and she let go of the trigger quickly to avoid tumbling backward. At the very least, there were no friendly fire injuries, and the whirring bladed mouth in the tentacle ahead of them exploded as a hail of bullets tore it apart.

She sighed, took a breathand two more tentacles emerged from the depths.

Gunfire shattered those, too, but four more arose. Then, ten more arose.

We have to get out of this river! Kendrick shouted.

Cheng turned the boat toward shore while repeated gunfire ruptured bladed mouth after bladed mouth. Unfortunately, their untrained fire was simply too slow, and several tentacles strucknot at them, but at the boat. Silver bubbled up from a massive hole in the broken center.

Jumping to shore and splashing through star-glinting silver alongside Jen, Randy did her best to keep her head despite such a disaster. The others clambered after them, reaching safety, but the boat began sinking with all nine bikes still locked in place. The last of the tentacles exploded after an angry shot by Kendrick, but there was nothing else to be done.

Even as they watched it grow lower in the water, a figure walked among them, and the squad suddenly split and pointed all guns at the white-haired and white-skinned newcomer garbed in jade armor. Under the moonlight, she looked deathly pale, and Randy stared.

Ignoring them, the newcomer walked right into the silver river and began pulling the sinking boat to shore by herself. Randys staring intensified, as did the amazed gazes of several others.

Leaving the boat on black and rust, but high and dry, the jade-clad pale woman turned to them. I request transport as compensation for this deed.

Kendrick kept his gun pointed, but glanced back at the others, who all shrugged in confusion. Uh, alright. Who are you?

I am Verene.

He hesitated. Sure, Verene. Im Kendrick. But I meant, why are you white like that?

The strange woman replied without emotion. My cells have all been retrofitted with replacement biomechanical support systems."

That caused the squad to back up, and Kendrick kept his trigger finger ready. You serve Her Glory?

I serve no one, now. Her Glory is gone.

But shes resurrecting, isnt she?

Yes.

So what are you doing here? Kendrick asked, growing exasperated.

Assisting the combined forces of the Coalition Alliance in destroying Her Glory before she can resurrect. I was on this river with many other soldiers. The boat and the soldiers were destroyed by the ambush here. To fulfill their orders, I must be taken to the Northern Point base immediately.

Many awkward glances were exchanged, but the pale woman seemed incapable of lying, and she was unarmed to boot. Being the smallest, Randy was the unlucky rider that ended up having to accommodate their new passenger. She shivered as those pale arms clasped around her from behind. Youre cold

Right behind her, sitting on the back edge of her seat, Verene told her rather matter of factly, Im dead.

Ah. That did not make her feel better.

Verene knew the directions, and the others wanted to keep an eye on her, so Randy was forced to be the lead bike. As they picked up speed, the dead womans hands sank lower for a better grip. Hey! Randy protested. At least buy me dinner first.

I do not buy things, Verene said loudly enough to be heard through her helmet and over the wind. Turn here. There is a clear expanse ahead; the upper side of a dormant factory. There will be no threats there.

She did as instructed, wondering if they were being led into a trapbut no threats presented themselves. The night remained quiet and eerie, lit by stars and spiky shadows. The ride was calm enough for Randy to begin asking questions. Say, whered you get that awesome armor?

Her Glorys machines built it from designs stolen from the Gemstone Hegemony, Verene told her. She then equipped me with it after killing me, retrofitting my cells, and resurrecting me.

Ah. She decided to stop asking questions. Well, maybe one more. What will happen to you when Her Glory wakes?

I will fall under her control once more. Verene paused. She seemed incapable of emotion and any personal drive, but her logical faculties remained. I will warn you if that is about to happen, and you will have roughly three minutes to escape.

Randy frowned in her helmet. Dont you want us to destroy you so you dont serve her anymore?

You lack the means to destroy me, the dead woman replied crypticallyand, perhaps, with the most infinitesimal hint of pride. Also, I do not have wants.

That was a strange thing to consider. Didnt all thinking beings have wants? Randy tried to imagine a life without desires and bonds. She looked back at Jen, at Kendrick, at her friends and the squad that had become family. They moved in ways efficient and strong, and it struck her that she treasured them in irreplaceable ways. Were they heading toward death at this very moment?

But there was no going back. Not with a wrathful tyrant that could shape reality itself waking somewhere ahead.

Disgusting yellow and putrid orange began seeping across the sky as the Sun rose once more. On the northern horizon, two things became visible: a massive tumble of spiky arcs and metal crystalline structures that dominated the sky and which spread long limbs of thick metal out for miles to unseen lands and a small walled base that looked like an anthill in comparison. The base was far closer than that monstrous citadel, true, but the differences in size and power were simply unthinkable.

Verene pointed, but Randy was already on track for those walls.

This base was absolutely gigantic, and actually seemed comprised of several small bases scattered about a highly defensible chrome valley. As they grew near, several jets took off from somewhere within.

Somebodys been busy, Edgar radioed, astounded.

Randy shared his awe. The Vanguard, and the following second wave and accompanying military offensive, had truly come together for something organized and powerful way out here in the multiverseand, yet, it still seemed a speck compared to that towering citadel floating on long limbs high to the north. She imagined she could actually *feel* the menace emanating from it.

---

Another day spent here. The hordes come at all hours: horrible biomechanical monsters, mockeries of all animal and plant life in the nearby multiverse. No humanoids yet.

Verene met with the commanders for hours, and then ended up back with us simply because everyone else is terrified or despairing. Were the only ones who seem to be awake and paying attention. Is this what war does to people?

I still cant figure out what time it is. Nobody seems to have taken care of their watches. Its driving me crazy.

The landscape seems to have grown more active in the last day. The higher-ups distributed small amethyst pyramids and told us to use them rather than become converts to Her Glory. Have they given up already? Not a single person here seems to have any hope left except us. Maybe we have to keep the hope alive, for Carmen, for everyone.

But what *time* is it? Why am I being denied this?

---

Unable to sleep due to the constant bombing and mortars going off in the night, Randy left her small tent and wandered over to where Jen was keeping watch over their small corner. Hey.

Sitting on a supply crate while distant explosions lit her hair with a halo of shadow and light, the blonde seemed absolutely lost for a moment. I dont know what to do, Randy.

All those moving pieces suddenly made themselves known again. What do you mean? What do you know that we dont?

We have to get past this, Jen said quietly, her eyes on the ground. We have to get past Her Glory. She looked up with misty eyes as flakes of snow began touching down on her arms. We cant stop. We cant stay here.

Worried, Randy scooted closer. I know its scary, but

To hell with fear, Jen interrupted. Im not afraid. I know Ive made the right choices in my life. But these people have given up. There are a hundred human bases out there in this horrible world, and I know in my heart theyre all filled with terrified men and women who think theyre simply being tortured before the end. It wasnt supposed to be this way.

They watched the shimmering globe around the distant demon citadel. Visible by starlight, it glimmered menacingly, promising a fierce energetic deterrence to any form of attack. By all accounts, that Shield was only growing stronger every hour as Her Glory neared waking. Jen leaned on her shoulder, and Randy sat with her for a time. There really was no way to make it better, but it was relief enough not to be alone.

	<TEXT> Jennifer Pixley held her arm over her face to ward off the icy wind as she worked her way down a rocky moss-covered slope. She expressed only a concerned glare for the weatherthe squad was not making good enough time. There had been too many interruptions, too many delays, and they might soon pay for it in ice.

The creek had mostly frozen over, but water was not her objective. Bits of frost grew along the small herbs even as she bent down to harvest them.

Breathing through her nose to avoid the chilly pain each inhalation brought, she stashed her gloves in her jacket pockets and worked quickly to deposit the necessary plants in a small plastic bag after testing them with colored drops to make sure they were an equivalent species. She did already have pre-natal vitamins hidden in the squads medical supplies, but those would have to remain a last resort. Their presence would incite too many questions.

She rubbed her hands to dust them off, slid her gloves back on, and studied the surrounding forest. Despairing grey clouds raced by unnaturally fast overhead, unloading their cargo of chill and snow with somber resignation. The trees seemed to shiver with each unseasonable gust, and that tense energy lifted her to her feet and set her hiking back toward camp. Her hurried trek stopped just short of the campfirejust out of sight.

Carmen Faulkner awaited her return behind a large boulder, doing pullups on a low tree branch. She dropped down and turned, worry etched along the edges of her eyes. Did you find it?

Jennifer nodded and handed her the bag. Just add the stalks and roots into your rations, like a spice. Its not everything, but itll have to do for now.

Thank you, the older woman said sincerely, studying the clumped plant matter. I really hope itll help. Im worried about riding all the time.

That wont be an issue for several weeks, Jennifer told her, touching her forearm. And thisll all be over by then, one way or another. Have you thought about telling Cheng?

No. Im already regretting telling the girls. Lian

Even at her worst, Lian didnt, Jennifer said, cutting her off. It was important not to let distrust fester. She wouldnt.

Saying nothing, Carmen looked away and pressed her lips together.

Not satisfied, Jennifer hit home the point again. You saw it. Shed be dead now if that gun had been loaded. She meant what she said.

Finally, Carmen nodded, shivered despite her recent exercise, and slipped off to the right without another word.

Jennifer tidied herself up, fixed her hair, grimaced against the cold, and slipped off to the left. Huddled around the fire, her squadmates were none the wiser about where either of them had been.

Somebodys been talking about you, Bill Nash commented from his huddled seat near the flames.

Huh? Jennifer hesitated halfway into her tent.

He laughed, and explained his folk reference. Your nose is bright red!

She gripped it with one gloved hand and smiled. Its the cold.

Brutal stuff, aint it? Bullshit, even.

Shed planned to climb into her tent and try to warm up, but duty called. Bill was very obviously not all right, as evinced by a slight quiver in the timbre of his voice. Instead of seeking privacy, Jennifer walked over and joined the circle of exhausted and chilled faces. Sitting on a makeshift log next to Bill, she gripped his shoulder amicably and spoke quietly. How ya doin, Bill?

His gaze jumped to Lians tent, where the broken girl lay sleeping and recovering from her many recent ordeals. Im alright. His tone belied his words.

Jennifer chose her question carefully, intent on sounding casual. Hows, uh, the whole decades spent in pain thing?

The mans face went pale behind his stubble as he thought about what had been done to him out of spite by that invading little machine. I try not to think about it.

You still having trouble feeling like this is your life? She kept her eyes on his, locking his gaze on her rather than Lians tent.

A little, he admitted, whispering as if ashamed. But its all starting to come back to me. Like Ive been on a long vacation, and Ive come back home to find its all exactly like I left it. It feels surreal.

She squeezed his shoulder. Thatll pass.

He nodded and turned his eyes down on the fire.

She stood, intent on returning to her tent. He was remarkably strong-willed, if his experiences while being electrocuted were true, and she had little doubt that they were. Or, perhaps, Edgar was right, and Bill had some sort of innate mental solidarity that sprung from his stubborn ability to soldier on under any conditions. She somewhat admired that trait, and certainly valued his role in the squad.

Nice, whats that? Bill said, eyeing Carmen as she dashed something on a ration.

The burly woman looked up in surprise. Not being a skilled liar, she simply stated the most basic truth. A spice we found out in the woods.

Tested and all?

Yeah.

The faces around the fire grew animated as the thought of adding actual *flavor* to their rations became a reality. Lian even emerged from her tent, a sickly specter of her former healthy self before the mission began, but recovered enough to come out, sit, and eat.

Jennifer maintained a smile, and even joined the circle and ate with them, but internally she cursed. She would have to sneak out that night and find more, as the bag of plant matter had been reduced to empty in short order by nine hungry mouths. Throughout the meal, she watched Lian carefully. The girls role in the squad was important, but it was hard to emotionally evaluate one so unique. The groups acceptance of her was equally unique, but it seemed that, in this kind of life, much could be forgiven for the sake of survival.

She wondered if that forgiveness would remain if her squadmates were to find out why they were really out here. Her expression fell as a particularly chill breeze made her shiver. Her moment of inner darkness lasted until she climbed into her tent and lay alone.

Two would be on watch this shift. Her turn would come in a few hours. It was dangerous to sneak off and leave part of the camp unguarded, but the vitamins were more important than any other priority. She couldnt sleep, so she used the time to plan her route.

A whisper came from outside. Hey, you up?

It was Randy.

Jennifer pretended to be passed out. Now was not the time.

The redhead eventually slipped away. A few minutes later, Jennifer heard her and Kendrick musing quietly about the days tribulations.

Once the talk stopped, she knew it was about time. Mona came to wake her and switch off, and Jennifer pretended to groggily take her station on the opposite side of the camp from Edgar. Keen, he would be a tough one to fool, but he also held a weird aversion to looking at or talking to her directly. It was possible he might not notice a brief enough absence. If he did, she could make an excuse about going to the bathroom or something, and he would probably buy it.

After an appropriate amount of time spent shivering furiously under a military-issue blanket, she propped the material up to look vaguely like she was still under it, and then crept out into the primordial forest among falling flakes of white set against moon-lit silver.

As she trod across the frosted ground, the crunching slowly became more snow than leaves, and she held her gloved hand over her mouth to stave off the icy pain of breathing. Again, she noted, she needed to get Kendrick to up the pace. Hed recently made caution a prime directive, but moving too slowly was also dangerous.

By moonlight, she found the creek again, and more of those same herbsbut she hesitated as they crackled under her bare fingers.

The plants were frozen solid.

She clenched her fists for a moment, both to ward off numbness and to resist anger. The vitamins would still be present, but this was a very bad sign. She ripped the small plants right out of the frozen mud and packaged them with unfeeling fingers. Halfway through donning her second glove, she heard a single crunch in the snow.

He was dirty. Disheveled, really. Beaten to hell, bruised all over, and thinner than the last time shed seen him. His formerly olive-hued skin had become pale. Where once hed been a decently attractive man, he now looked closer to a prison camp survivor than a soldier.

How did you get through the purple sky reality? she asked, aghastbut a little impressed.

Clint unclenched his jaw, shuddering with pain against some sort of swollen lump beneath his front teeth where he had clearly taken a brutal hit. What purple sky reality?

For the first time, it occurred to her that he might not have been taking the same paths they had. Just go away. You cant be trusted.

Please! He stumbled down the snowy, mossy slope under silver moonlight, joining her on the frozen creek. You dont know what its been like, I

She glared. Oh trust me, its been no picnic. Her fists rose. You want another beating?

He was too desperate to back down this time. He came forward with grasping hands.

A swift tap sent him sprawling on the ice.

She backed up, heading for the camp. She made no attempt to hide her tracks, for the dogged man had the uncanny ability to find them regardless. That was his role, what he had been statistically sought out fora vague sense of where to find specific things he'd interacted with even just once, a sense that he didnt know he possessedbut the actual product had turned out to have been defective.

He ran after her with the strength of a starving man in one last leap for food, but she heard him coming in the snow. A simple sidelong grip allowed her to sling him forward, and he crashed into white powder. A moment later, he was up again, and she decided to get more flashy to drive home her point. You cant win. She jumped in a curling motion, sprang on her hands, and wrapped her legs around his head. A forceful roll curved him into a tree, and he clung to it, gasping and bleeding from his cheek. She bounced back up to a standing position.

Fine, for Gods sake, fine! he panted. If the others dont want me, I understand. How did they vote?

Grasping unexpectedly for a lie, she didnt respond quickly enough.

His eyes narrowed with anguished confusion. You didnt tell them, did you? That Im out here, that Im following? Do they even know Im still alive?

Only she, Kendrick, and Cheng knew the truth, and the two men had no idea shed been secretly reading their journalsor that Clint was still on their trail. She sighed, unable to keep her heart as cold as the biting night air. Clint, you need to find somewhere that can support a single man, and then just *live*. You cant come with us. You cant be trusted, and trust is all we can rely on out here.

Ive *paid* for my mistakes, he gasped, falling to a sitting position against his tree trunk. You cant imagine the nightmares Ive seen. I even ran across people. There was a child His gaze went distant, and a tear rolled down his right cheek, smearing traces of blood down his chin. I tried to help him. I tried to do the right thing! So many childrenthey were deadand their parents, ravenousneon purple eyes

Madness? she asked, unable to turn away.

Lacking the strength of will to speculate, he gave a very slight resigned shrug.

She didnt ask where the child hed tried to protect was now. Instead, she pulled a food ration out from a pocket in her fatigues and threw it to him. Find safety, Clint. Find peace. Inwardly returning to her duties, she tapped the gun on her hip. But find it somewhere else. If you try to reach us again, Ill have to shoot you. You know that, right?

His gaze still a thousand miles away, his only response was a hopeless nod.

She kept her eyes on him as she walked away. He already looked like someone had left a corpse curled up in a sitting position against a tree in the snow-draped woods. The play of moonlight, darkness, and drifting white conspired to make him seem lifeless and timeless, as if he had died centuries ago and simply been frozen in that position for all time.

And she had left him that way. Heart heavy, she trekked back to camp, scanned the area to make sure nothing had gone awry, and crawled back under her blanket to resume watch.

That quiet heaviness remained with her as the squad awoke, packed up the tents and scattered supplies, and began the days ride. Her bike hummed along underneath her, bouncing with the odd bump in the terrain, and she noticed for the first time that the whole thing was beginning to feel a bit lighter. Her gas mileage had been rising bit by bit, tooabout a third of each bikes reserve fuel was gone. That meant a crucial conversation would be happening sooner rather than later. At right around half fuel, important group decisions would need to be made, and she spun her mental gears in preparation for those conversations. She would have to play it simple and direct, as her squadmates had come to see her, and let her purposely mis-aimed points organically allow others to think of her real goal on their own.

A rift passed around her, and she hardly looked up. At least it was growing warmer with each new transition. Shed ridden through so many cracks in reality, they were beginning to become mundane.

The vista beyond was anything but mundane. She broke out of her thoughts as her squadmates radioed surprise. Looking up at what she could see from inside her helmet, she stared. Are we *upside down?*

There was no Sun. That she saw immediately. Diffuse gentle light seemed to radiate from everywhere, perhaps from space itself, and tremendous islands of rock and mist floated all around. There was no actual *sky*, for the floating mountains and plateaus blocked out the entire dome of her vision at varying distances, and at varying levels of obscurity by water vapor. Even those small areas she thought might show onto open sky eventually, after some staring, proved to be simply very distant lands nearly made invisible by mistiness.

As she rode with her squadmates along a flat expanse populated by glimmering grasses, she began to notice that many of the nearby islands held structures that had been carved from the very rock and crystal itself.

Mona radioed the realization first. People live here!

Hell yes, Kendrick responded. Time to make some new allies. Head for the structure at eleven oclock. Form up. He turned his bike, and the rest followed, expanding into their practiced formation in case of unforeseen threats.

Jennifer held up the left end of their wide line as she studied the palatial fortress. If this reality was what she thought it was, it would turn out to be a massive church rather than a secular construction. She could even see the bell in its high glittering spire, now, as the walls approached. Everything here was beautiful, reallythe whole reality, wondrous and unique among the universesbut it should absolutely *not* still have existed. A dark chill ran up her spine despite the warm air flowing past her.

A vaguely transparent enormous wall of rainbow-shimmering crystal met them, and Kendrick called for them to slow down. A wide gate allowed passage inside, and the nine rode further in.

Stay sharp, their Captain murmured, his warning redundant.

Nothing moved.

It was indeed a gigantic church, complete with strange religious iconography that glowed eternally with the diffuse light filtering in through crystal, but dust hinted that nobody had worshipped there in quite some time. Removing their helmets, stepping down from their bikes, and leaving everything under guard by Bill, Cheng, and Lian, six of the squad moved to quietly explore on foot. Jennifer made sure that she was among them.

She carefully watched Edgar as they walked. Of anyone in the group, he would be most likely to remember what this world was. Indeed, he kept his face perpetually screwed up, the realization right on the edge of his thoughts. If he did figure it out, there was a risk that bad decisions would be made.

Coming to a deathly silent study that contained objects made of all sorts of rare materialseverything imaginable except for woodKendrick pointed at a gold-robed body in an ornate chair. The Prelates skin had decayed to a grey color, but their Captain had recognized the dressings.

At the back of the exploring group, Jennifer grimaced.

Kendrick did not lift his handheld radio. Instead, he whispered, We need to figure out what happened here. Just like Amber Two, this place was supposed to have been destroyed.

Carmen studied religious texts that had been carved out of extremely thin beaten gold, her frown compassionate. If we could just let the Yngtaks know their homeworld still exists

A pallor of dismay fell over the group, exactly as Jennifer had feared. She hated to speak up so directly in seeming favor of the ill-fated idea, but it had to be done. How do we find them?

We cant, Mona said, fighting back a miserable unhappiness. All those people, walkingdying. An entire race

Edgars sensible logic turned the conversation toward where Jennifer hoped it would go. We just dont have the time, the resources, or the skills to find them right now. Maybe once weve succeeded and returned home, the military can send out scouts to find them. It would be a worthy cause.

Unhappy nods were slow to come, but inevitable. Fuck! Kendrick muttered, probably thinking back on how he hadnt traded food to those hapless exiles.

Jennifer kept her mouth shut, but her eyes open. Never had she been more thankful that Clint was out. He might actually have been able to find the yellow-skinned wanderers now had he been with the group to interact with them before.

Close beside her, Randy frowned. Dont get sad yet, guys. We dont know what happened here. This place is dead. How do we know its even livable?

That statement simultaneously relieved everyone *and* put them on edge. There was no obvious sign of what had killed the Prelate, but maps printed in beaten and painted gold had been laid out on his crystalline desk. Jennifer stood guard at the door with Randy while the other four studied those schematics.

Hey, the redhead whispered. Whats up?

Jennifer looked down at the shorter girl briefly, her eyes soon returning to the quiet dappled hallways outside. Nothing, why?

Randy shrugged, visibly trying to stay positive. We just havent talked in awhile.

She paused, hoping for an interruption. Like clockwork, one came.

Thought so, Edgar said loudly and happily. See here? The Yngtaks had to have had technology to rival the First Worlds, given their history of conflict. It just doesnt look like ours.

I see it, Mona replied, waving the two others over.

Jennifer led, and Randy followed closely.

Look here, Mona continued, pointing at several large floor designs. Theres nothing here that could be described as a *machine*, but if you were looking for *gemstone* technology

Randys eyes grew wide. Crystalline!

Edgar and Mona nodded in sync with one another. Right here, they both said. They looked at one another, nodding. Control center.

Lets check it out, Kendrick ordered. His gaze lingered on the schematics. I wonder what this guy was trying to plan when he died.

Nobody had answer.

Down windowless crystal halls that glowed with light reflected through expert myriad constructions, the team began coming across more bodies. All had simply fallen where they had stood. No injuries were apparent.

A tremendous security system of pulleys and rainbow vault doors stood in the way at the back of one gigantic hexagonal chamber, but everything was open. An octagonal room lay beyond, filled with glinting artifacts resting on imperious carvingsand one strange creation that shot from the floor to the ceiling a hundred feet above.

I thought you said they didnt have machines like ours? Jennifer asked, hoping to understand the situation sooner than her peers.

Randy stared at the massive pillar of chrome, coils, and wires. Ive seen this. Designs for it, I mean. It looks like a smaller version of one of our Shield generators.

Edgar frowned. What, we just happened to stumble upon this?

No, there could be thousands of these, Mona thought aloud. One in every church. Mass produced stolen technology.

Staring at the incomprehensible pillar of technology, Kendrick asked the obvious question. So they had a bootleg Shield, which likely played a role in this place survivingso why are they all dead?

Randy and Mona exchanged ideas for a moment, eventually coming up with two shrugs and, Maybe because it wasnt perfect?

Edgar, on the other hand, spent his time touching the artifacts. He exclaimed Hah! as a wall of rainbow light appeared and coalesced into something resembling a computer screenif said computer had a purely religious and symbolic operating system. The others gathered around as he painfully learned how to navigate the textless and metaphorical interface.

How about that one? Jennifer said, purposely offering the wrong choice.

Shaking his head, Edgar ignored her. Instead, he systematically pushed his finger through the hologram of each top-level symbol, making sure not to go too deep into any sort of real functionality until he knew what he was doing. Not very user-friendly, he complained.

It wouldnt be, Mona said, watching over his shoulder intently. Just like how monks maintained a religious monopoly in Europes Middle Ages. If youre the only one that knows how to access vital information, youre irreplaceable.

Edgar grunted a surprised agreement. Someone should have given the Yngtaks a printing press, then.

We*they*tried, she said softly. The best intentions

Jennifer remained silent, her focus on an unhappy comparison. First World profit-seekers had tried to harvest diamond farmers and thus started a thousand year stand-off with the Gemstone Hegemony, and First World do-gooders had tried to help the Yngtaks with information technologies, thus igniting centuries of tension with the Prelate Hierarchy. Meddling seemed to have no good consequences.

The only winning move is not to play, Edgar muttered.

She froze, about to ask what he'd meant by mirroring her next thought, but she quickly saw what was on his mind.

He touched nothing on the screen for two minutes, counting out loudand new symbols appeared.

Of course! Mona explained, snapping her fingers. Unauthorized users would press buttons constantly, trying to learn the system in as short a time as possible before they became discovered. Only regular users would be in here enoughand have enough timeto let the system simply idle.

Edgar crowed with triumph. Research notes!

The group crowded around and watched as a presentation began auto-playing. A Yngtak Prelate in pure white robes stood describing certain images. His language was incomprehensible, but the pictures told more than enough of the story.

Layers, Randy breathed, putting the pieces together. A layered Shield

Like skin on a grape, Mona said, turning to face her with wide eyes. The two women began speaking quickly to one another. Edgar followed with an expression of vague understanding.

Kendrick sighed with subtle bemusement. Ladies. Please explain.

Randy nodded over, and Mona faced her squadmates. Its like skin on a grape, sir. A layered Shield isnt necessarily stronger or better than the First Worlds formidable barrier, but it *does* collapse layer by layer no matter how much force is applied, or how quickly its being destroyed.

And?

Jennifer watched her squadmates faces. This information was treading on dangerous territory.

Randy took over, excited. That gives the reality inside a shot, sir.

A shot to do what?

She hesitated, and then understood. No, I mean a *shot*, literally. Fires it off into the multiverse like the bullet from a gun. Imagine the Shield slipping off and imploding infinitesimally close to spacetimea spacetime which then takes off like a bat out of hell because of the pressure. Were no experts, but thats absolutely what this yellow-faced guy is talking about.

Jennifer watched Kendrick process that information, her heart pounding.

The former farmhand began putting two and two together. So that means thats the way Amber Two survived. How they got out here.

Yes.

His words came down like hammers in her ears. So are all of the Amber Worlds still out here somewhere?

Randy and Mona looked at each other, both realizing it at the same moment. The ones that didnt explode before the endyes.

A moment of silence followed as five men and women thought about what they had just discovered. A moment after that, the arguments began.

Does somebody already know about this? Edgar asked, confused and horrified. How have we already run into two realities like this? Who chose our path?

Jennifer said nothing, her pulse reaching a rushing crescendo in her head.

I dont think we can trust anything weve been told about our mission anymore, Kendrick said, staring at the holographic video. Theres just too much weirdness.

Randy and Mona argued about particular details of the event in question, wondering if it would be possible to determine *where* a reality had gone after ejection based on trails it had left behind.

Carmen put her hands up, silencing everyone. This hasnt felt right to me since Amber Two. Everything weve been told is peeling away bit by bit, showing rot underneath. She said the exact words Jennifer had fearedand she'd known Carmen would be the one to say them, considering her situation. We should seriously think about going home.

Nobody knew what to say.

The uncomfortable suggestion would mean the end of their mission, and possibly of their little family. It was sensible, but painful.

Kendrick summoned up a response. I dont know. Maybe the higher-ups have lied to us for a reason. Like that monster that could read our thoughts, and let us go because we *believed* this mission was important. And *food*that they cant lie about, right? They cant feed three hundred and fifty billion people. No way, no how. Not with the ruined planets that the Crushing Fist left us with. He trembled with rising anger. No! I refuse to let anything sway my path. Im out here to blaze a trail against existence for humanity. We deserve *more!* Weve been dealt a shit hand, and *I wont stop!* He bent over without warning, his words fading as small flames erupted from his left arm and shoulder.

Everyone stared in surprise, until Jennifer shook herself out of it and prompted Mona.

In a rush, the group pulled off their jackets and began hitting Kendrick with them, extinguishing the flames trailing down his arm. He groaned against the pain of the fire, but did not pass out.

Summoning up her skills from her first career, Jennifer kneeled down and pulled his already torn-up and poorly-repaired uniform away from the burns.

Mona joined her and tried to assess what was happening. Its not his biomechanical half. Its his natural arm. There are flames spontaneously rising from his skin! What the hell could be causing it?

Horrified, Jennifer just shook her head.

The radio crackled to life, and Bills worried voice reached them all. Guys, somethings wrong with Cheng!

Kendrick fought his way to his feet despite the pain of his burns and grunted out a command. Back to the bikes this might be what killed them

That had already occurred to everyone else, and Jennifer helped Carmen assist Kendrick down the crystalline halls of the corpse-filled megachurch. The others stayed close, eyes on every passing hallway for threats, but they reached the bikes in short order.

Cheng lay on the ground, convulsing.

Mona ran over, pulled out her medical kit from her bikes supplies, and began to study him. Jennifer joined her, and her first touch told her all she needed to knowas confusing as it was. Hes not burning. Hes *cold.*

He was quiet, Bill said behind them. Then he just fell!

Probing patches of ice on the seizing mans arms and chest, Mona gave a report. Theres ice rising from his skin in patterns similar to Kendricks fire.

Jennifer stopped mid-examination for a moment. Of all the people in the squad, she herself had the best understanding of their inner emotions. But would talking about those emotions give away that she had been reading their journals? She pressed her eyes shut briefly, knowing that she had to do whatever she could to save Cheng. I think it has something to do with emotions.

Circled around, the others looked on, while Mona, kneeling beside her, frowned. How so?

Kendrick got angry, Jennifer said, carefully trying to sound a little ditzyonly as much as appropriate for the situation, but enough to hopefully avoid suspicion. Then fire came out of his skin. Chengs the opposite. He feels numb. He feels cold.

How would you know that? Carmen asked, on edge.

I can see it in his face, she lied, hoping the emergency would let her gloss over any further explanation. I dont think these emotional differences are a coincidence. She pulled on information from her past job. Emotions actually cause physical temperatures to deviate in your body due to blood flow changes. If something is enhancing that effect, strong emotions that make you cold or hot could be lethal. In other words, you need to break him out of his numbness. She let those words trail off. There was only one way, and shed walked right into it.

Despite her usual strength, Carmen began crying.

Whats going on? Kendrick asked, oblivious.

Bill Nash, too, looked on in askance.

Oh shit, Edgar breathed, guessing.

Carmen leaned down next to Cheng and held his hand. His convulsions stopped after a few seconds, but the ice continued to spread.

It might be working, Mona whispered to her.

Cheng Yao, Carmen said softly, tears flowing freely. I didnt want this to happen. Not out here, not like this, not at my age, and not after what Ive already lostbut its happening, and I think you of all people might appreciate it the most. Lian wasnt lying when she said you wouldnt be the last Yao. She already knew. All the girls did. She sobbed, and tiny bits of frost began to form in her hair.

Tell him, Jennifer insisted.

Im pregnant, Carmen forced out, before squeezing her eyes shut as hard as she could.

Kendrick and Bill looked at each other with boyish surprise.

The pain seemed to fade from Chengs face, and his eyes became focused again.

Quickly, Mona began pulling ice from his clothes and skin. Jennifer followed suit, adrenaline pushing her near passing out. Too much information, too many suspicionsthere would be a price to pay for all this, and soon. Someone was going to guess why they were really out here, and disaster would soon follow.

Hes stable, Mona said, pulling her away. She addressed the others. Come on, give those two a minute.

Once the seven were apart from the two, the expected questions were asked, and answers were given.

I dont know how I feel about this, Kendrick said. A baby? Out here?

The mission will be over long before it matters, Jennifer told him. No matter what the outcome.

I guess so.

Mona still seemed worried. Whats happening to us, though? Carmen, Kendrick, Chengthats three people affected. I have no doubt its in all of us. Try to avoid strong emotion.

Bill Nash nodded the most to that one, remaining quieter than usual.

This isnt how they died, Kendrick said, looking back at the elegant entrance to the church. I didnt see any signs of burns or ice.

Its us, then, Randy realized. What did our drill sergeant say? The laws of each reality are carried along by their particles. She threw up a hand. Of course! Its something we ate or drank!

Jennifer thought back to the herbs she had collected. They hadnt been poisonous, but that didnt mean they hadnt carried other effects with them. And everybody had some

Shit, Bill said. I shoulda kept my mouth shut. He stared at his arm as frost crept along the elbow of his jacket. Im fine, Im fine, stop!

Itll pass, Mona said urgently. The atoms and molecules are part of us for now, but, eventually, theyll be flushed out.

How long? Lian asked, biting her lip.

Mona hesitated, visibly thinking. Um, every sixteen days about seventy-two percent of you is replaced. Thats the water. Heavy elements can take nearly a year. Lining in stomach and intestine every four days gums, two weeks skin every four weeks but, uh, actually, the surface cells in our digestive system, from our mouths to our large intestines, are replaced every five minutes

So a few days, then? Kendrick asked.

Guess so, Mona said, unsure of herself. Hopefully the molecules will leave us asymptotically, and stop being dangerous once too few remain.

That brought some relief. There was nothing to do but stand apart and wait for Carmen and Cheng to finish smiling, crying, and whispering to each other. She remained kneeling, clasping his hand as he lay on the ground recovering.

Jennifer Pixley watched with hard eyes. Shed felt that connection once, but it had turned sour and horrible. It had taken the coming of the Crushing Fist to free her from that abusive bastard, and hed fully deserved the silver noose that had found him. She didnt regret their relationship anymore, though, nor the hits shed taken. Theyd left her strong inside, and toughenough to volunteer for the loneliest duty possible, enough to pull off her hidden secondary mission alone. But the pain in her heart at that moment was immense, for reasons she couldnt articulate, and she felt a tear forming in her left eye. Was it really possible to do this alone? Was it really possible to *live* alone, even among friends? She glanced over at Lian, who clung tightly to Bill; behind them, Mona leaned against Edgar, while the usually recalcitrant introvert actually relented and put his arm around her.

Past them all, Randy stood alone.

Kendrick, she said, her eyes moving back to the squads first mother- and father-to-be.

Yeah? he asked, noticing that nobody else was in hearing range.

We have to go faster.

Sensing something off in her tone, he made sure to remain nonchalant. What do you mean?

Remember that twenty miles an hour average you wanted? she continued. Remember how it was based on the twenty thousand miles our Brekat commander challenged us to reach?

Yeah He glanced at her, wary.

Theres a reason for that. We need to go faster. She said nothing further.

He said nothing else, either, his expression neutral, but his eyes betraying concern.

A chilly wind blew through the church courtyard, and flakes of snow began touching down on their shoulders.

64% fuel remaining. Were going by fuel instead of dates now, because we dont know exactly what day it is, and the gas we have left is the biggest factor in our lives anyway. That, and food, which is running low again. We lost quite a bit out in the purple reality while wandering and hallucinating.

I think theyre about to start guessing for real. Once they hit upon the truth, itll seem obvious. And once theyve got that, I have a feeling my role will become plain as day. I just hope theyll accept what Ive donewhat I will do and understand why I had to do it. It's worse than Lian. It's worse than being a murderer who can't help herself, because I *chose this role.*

I volunteered to betray them. </TEXT>

Upon his return to the former circle, he saw the divide already beginning. Carmen, Cheng, and Kendrick stood on one side, while Mona, Randy, and Jennifer stood arguing from the other. Between, Bill and Lian waited meekly for their fate to be decided. Edgar had no doubt Bill would go with her either way.

Enough! he shouted. We cant afford to be divided. Recognize that.

The six arguers looked at himand then at his gun.

Whatever it took to survive, Edgar told himself. Recognize it! Shes already a threat, just by being hereshell tear us apart!

That stunned them all into silence.

He held the gun forward. Lian, you said you would kill yourself before hurting one of us.

She nodded. If I feel my control slipping again, Ill kill myself before I hurt any of you.

He took a deep breath before explaining. Youre already hurting us, Lian. Look at the divide youre causing. Were dead if were not united. Hell, we might be dead men walking even if we are. We cant risk even a small amount of infighting.

After long glances to her left and to her right at the worried eyes of her squadmates, she understood. Tears began rushing profusely down her cheeks, and she screwed up her facebut she quickly grabbed the gun from his hand.

Bill dove for it, but missed. Lian, no!

She dodged away from him, lifted the gun to her right temple, and said with a final sob, I love you all.

She pulled the trigger before anyone could stop her.

---

The others will forgive me. I know they will, in time. Im not so sure about Bill. He looks at me like Im a monster. Thats something Ill have to live with.

For now, its enough that we survived, and that well continue on undivided.

There will be no questioning Lian now. Even Im satisfied that shell shoot herself again if it comes to thatand, next time, the gun will be loaded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Edgar Brace ran a hand along his head, feeling his near-buzz-cut. Hed been thinking about growing it longer, but he hadnt had the guts to stick with it just yet. His date would probably like the shorter hair, anyway; her profile had made her sound like a sorority type. She wasnthe knew she was actually a huge nerd who had just been trying not to scare guys awaybut that information flowed through his awareness in a second channel to which his thoughts did not seem to have direct access.

At long last, he logged off of his game and went to get ready in the bathroom down the hall. The walls here were dirty white stucco, and indelibly burned in his sense memories as passing textures during hurried round trips from his computer. The house only had the one bathroom, and he was lucky his roommates werent using it. Still, he cursed as he saw the time: he was late.

It was his curse, really. He was always late.

He threw on a shirt, rubbed some deodorant under his arms, and hurried downstairs. At the front door, he paused.

Somewhere else, a man he respected spoke. We cant keep getting caught off guard like this. In that strange second river, a grim strong-jawed face wavered in the waters of his mind. We cant use running to the next place as a strategy anymore. We just keep stumbling into worse and worse nightmares, and the next of us wont be as lucky as Bill. We have to take each transition seriously. We have to slow down, or were gonna fuck up, and were gonna die.

Edgar touched the door to his apartment lightly, and then made rounds to each window instead. The rundown environs looked clearof what, he wasnt sure. The fading afternoon light lent an edge to his pre-date tension, as if he expected something terrible to descend upon all the world come the setting of the Sun.

Time. There was still time.

He pushed out onto the street, braving the world at large. Cars rolled past, and passersby courteously said hello. One woman was even walking a dog. He stared. Didnt they know? How could they *not know what was coming?* But as he grasped at the particulars of his fears, they eluded him.

The sidewalk scrolled past underneath his feet as he watched the various passing cracks and little rocks. His date had been set for a coffee shop only two blocks awayhe didnt like going too far for things that held little chance of successso he made the most of his rapidly draining time. He kicked a stone repeatedly, seeing how long he could keep it directly ahead of his feet. It skittered into the road, lost, just as he reached the low fence marking the coffee shops patio.

She wasnt stunning, but that made her absolutely gorgeous. If a girl with dazzling movie star looks had sat waiting for him, he might have walked on and pretended not to be himself. He wouldnt assume she was a bitch, not really, but it would definitely be safe to bet that he didnt have the jackass bravado to keep someone like that interested. No, this plain brown-haired girl was just like him, and that stunned him with possibilities.

She saw him and happily waved.

Oh, that was good. That meant she wasnt pretending not to be herself.

He came around the fence and sat with her at one of the small tables. Um, hey. Rachel?

Yeah. She flashed a genuine smile. Ed, right?

Yes. He preferred Edgar, but hed guessed Ed was a cooler moniker. How are you doing?

Great! Its beautiful out today, its Saturday, so I dont have to work. Im feeling good. She didnt look around at the airy blue sky or its growing hint of bruised darkness on the horizon. Her eyes remained only on him.

A distant rumble rolled through his soul; thunder from a storm unseen. He looked away.

Her smile fell. Something wrong?

This doesnt work out, he said quietly, in a tone barely louder than a whisper. I break your heart.

She sat a little taller in her seat, confused.

Somewhere behind him, perhaps in the alley beside the coffee shop, he heard the subtle scraping sound of a knife being drawn from a sheath. Some dark cloud hung behind him; an unknown figure moving down the alley, intent on emerging quietly.

She touched his hand. Youre too fatalistic. How could you possibly know that?

Fatalisticnot the first time youve said that about me. A rushing roar grew in his head as his silent pursuer neared. He looked up at her. Do you trust me?

I dont know why, but I think I do. She narrowed her eyes, trying to understand her own feelings.

Someones trying to kill us, he whispered. Lets go.

He didnt wait for an answer. Instead, he grabbed her hand and pulled her up. Together, they ran out through the patios gate and around the opposite corner just in time to avoid being seen by the slowly stalking shadow that now studied the table where they had been. Edgar couldnt see it directly from his position, but, somehow, he knew it was there.

His flight took them both further away, past long lines of parked cars and trees that calmly swayed in the late afternoon breezes of summer. Two more blocks, several more turns, and he felt that dark presence lose track of them. Finally, he pulled what he remembered as his girlfriend of several years behind two large trash cans and hid, gasping.

Between deep panicked breaths, she asked, What the hell is going on?

Theres at least another year and a half before it happens, he forced out, clutching his chest.  I remember the day we met. I remember. We still had time. He sent feelers out from his awareness, trying to find that second river of knowledge. Brains didnt work that way, though, and he realized he couldnt connect without context. All he hadlike the stories, shows, and movies he so lovedwere the tales.

The tales stood apart, and without context. The tales simply existed. He could not summon any clue as to when he had read them, or in what situations, or with which people, but the tales still hung as silent vivid tapestries in his hall of memories. That was the spirit of his soul. He was a reader; a follower of the exploits of heroes.

Ward Shaw, he breathed, grasping at a powerfully stitched image set in black chaos. We have to find Ward Shaw. If I can warn him, they might be able to do something. We still have at least a year and a half.

Rachels hair danced slowly in a chill wind coming in off the darkening horizon. That calm visual moved in contrast to her fear. What is it? Whats going to happen?

He touched her right temple, in the soft spot level with her eyes, just to make sure. Bad things. Pulling her by the hand, he ran for a busy nearby intersection. Thered been a car accident that day, and he remembered being told about it by his roommates because of its proximity to his home.

The camera crews were still there. Lucky that hed arrived at the right time of day, he told himself, not sure if he actually had. It was still late afternoon, but the skys warm blue light was growing increasingly tainted. Letting go of Rachels hand, he pushed the reporter out of the way and grabbed her microphone before speaking directly into the camera with intent. I know all about the First World, and I need to speak with Brigadier General Ward Shaw. Otherwise, the public *will* be told.

That would be enough. He knew they would hear about what hed done. He knew somebody was monitoring the media. The existence of other realities and the dominance of the First World empire werent purposeful secrets, but many rich men and many large corporations had every incentive to keep the public in the dark. They would

He turned and watched a military truck drop off a squad that hastily rushed over and shut down the camera crew before roughly grabbing him. Rachel shrieked as they seized her, too.

That had been fastterrifyingly fast. Had these men simply been already nearby by chance? He managed to see several men guarding the back of the truck as it picked up speed. Their guns remained pointed at something dark lurking further down the street; his hollow hunter.

It hadnt been chance. Hed been pursued by some dark entity, and *theyd* been pursuing *it.*

Rachel stared at him with concern from across the swaying truck. Whats going on, Ed?

One of their captors shouted. No talking!

Unable to console her, Edgar stared defiantly up at the other man. I need to speak to Ward Shaw

Shut the hell up! Youll get your chance to talk to him. It better be good. Otherwise, youre going in a dark hole somewhere for a long, long time.

He nodded twice, alarmed, and said nothing further.

The ride was interminably long, but startlingly short. A blur of moments passed, faster than Edgar was able to care about or process, until both he and his girlfriend were pulled from the truck and marched between high concrete walls at gunpoint. She was terrified, but not hysterical; she had always been strong like that. He mouthed a silent apology to her as they entered the military compound proper.

He tried to memorize the path. Left, down a hallway; right, past several staging areas; left again, and into a barely furnished office that held little more than a desk and three chairsone of which held a savagely imposing bearded man who maintained an implacable expression of mild curiosity.

The soldiers pushed Edgar and Rachel into the two remaining chairs and departed. Edgar looked after them, but the man behind the desk gave a short laugh. I dont need their protection. Trust me.

Rachel began to apologize for them both. I dont know what hes doing, but

Cutting her off, Edgar glared at their host. Youre not him.

The bearded man raised both eyebrows. Oh?

Ive seen his face, on television, Edgar insisted, trying to remember when and where it had been. For some reason, the only thing that came to mind was a beat-up old television set powered by a makeshift car battery system nestled between tents and a fire. Why he had been camping and watching a battered television set, or when that had been, he couldnt recall. The story, though that remained. Ive seen him on trial.

The man in the chair watched him with an intrigued expression, until an even larger man stepped in from the hallway. Its alright, Nolan. You can go.

Their initial host nodded, stood, and slipped out, while their new one moved around the desk and sat.

Edgar stared. Youre Ward Shaw. Youre the Brigadier General!

This bearded man, initially even more stern than his body double, gave them a smile. Brigadier General? Not yet, no, but I appreciate the flattery. He sat tall in his chair and placed his heavy hands on the desk. Clearly, theres something going on with you. One Edgar Brace, twenty, studying computer science. At risk of failing out of college, he spends almost all his time playing online games to a self-destructive degree. He knows nothing of the truth of existence, and has accessed no such information digitally. Ward leaned further forward, his eyes piercing. So who are *you?* And why are you being hunted by a type of entity weve never seen before? 

Lacking any context for the conversation, Rachel responded to the one point that did make sense to her. She looked over in dismay. You might fail out?

I told you Id break your heart, Edgar whispered back, his heart cold in his chest. There was no way he could explain the bitter pointlessness he saw in existence; had always seen. He fought back old pains and locked eyes with their host. You look exactly the same.

I would, Ward responded cryptically. You seem to have very disconcerting knowledge, and youve said some very strange things about ranks and events that clearly have not happened yet. Tell me this, Edgar Brace. What year do you think it is?

Two-thousand-seven, he said. Twenty-fifteen, he also said, at the same time.

The room briefly shivered around them, warped by two simultaneous answers and two simultaneous voices.

Ward gripped his desk. Well then. He waited until the shaking calmed. Best that we not do that again. Ill try to keep the relevance of my questions limited to just one of you.

Rachel stared, wide-eyed, but Edgar couldnt bring himself to apologize again. Instead, he said, Something terrible is coming.

Ward waited, his eyes expectantand subtly haunted.

Its some sort of force of nature, of the multiverse, he tried to explain, grasping at particular threads in the proper tapestry while said threads did their best to escape his grasp. In a year and a half, it strikes, and it devastates *everything.*

Glancing down at his desk, Ward went somewhere very distant. Its been a long time coming.

His heart racing as bits of knowledge eked their way into his thoughts, he stumbled over the words. And meImwere searching for food, for everyone, and maybe for a new home.

At that, the huge man glanced up, a sharp note in his gaze. You mean the human race survived?

Edgar nodded, desperate to be understood and believed. We were at the very edge of the Devastation. And still, the Shield dropped to like four percent or something. And a whole lot of terrible things started leaking in. Monsters. Nightmares. Fates worse than death. Society fell apart, and thats when we He looked over at Rachel, who watched him with wide and sad eyes. Did she guess? Could she possibly understand? We just thought that there was nothing left to survive for.

Clearly you changed your mind, Ward stated. Seeing that youve traveled back in time to warn us somehow. He sighed. Its amazing that youve done this, but its too bad theres nothing we can do.

Pierced by confused despair, Edgar felt pinned to his seat. What? Why?

What *would* you have us do? the not-yet-Brigadier-General asked with a note of pained regret. We cant fight the beast youre speaking of. We cant even alter its mindless future actions one iota, not with all the technology and weapons at our disposal.  We cant move our realities, and we could never convince the rotted willpower of the First World of the need to venture out into the wild multiverse on one mans word. Perhaps absolute proof would still not be enough. I suspect that they might welcome Death if it were to rain down from the sky tomorrow. Only a very few of us retain the strength to go on. Strength is all that mattersall that remainsand we simply do not have enough.

Chilled to the bone, Edgar recalled the motivations behind the Brigadier Generals downfall. That desperation for strength would be his undoing. He thought of warning the man, of saying something about his fate, butwould that risk the minimal survival the human race *had* achieved? This mans thread was woven right into the Tapestry of Fates, and to unravel even one felt exceedingly dangerous. Painfully saddened, he said nothing.

The question is, Ward mused after a moment, his hand absently stroking his bearded chin as he made calculations. How did you get here? Purposeful time travel to the past, physically, is impossible, so you must have had some sort of mental overlay or union. Ive some experience with that. He leaned forward nearly completely over the desk. Tell me, what were you doing just before you came here?

That was one question, Edgar realized, that he should have asked himself already. Tracing the strange duality in his mind, he began speaking, his eyes often darting over to Rachels worried expression. We had, uh yes, wed just entered a new coastal area when He looked up, stunned. They caught up to us.

Who?

Men from Amber Two, he breathed, fighting down physical panic. Men that thought that letting us leave had been a mistake. Men that thought we might give away their secretthat theyd survived the Devastation. Somewhere out in the Void, theres a gigantic crushed ball of inter-reality dust that germinated around Amber Twos backup Shieldbut, somehow, impossibly, Amber Two is not inside it.

Ward Shaw stared, his expression unreadable. Why would they want to keep that a secret?

Edgar shook his head slowly.

Ill just file that one away, then, Ward said softly. Until its time. They must have a good reason.

They had guns, Edgar whispered, lost in his own swim through strange memories. But so did we. I had to shoot a man in the head He saw the blood spray, all over again, from the mans templewhere he himself should have once been wounded the same way, had he but had the courage. And then then oh God. An amethyst pyramid found us again.

That actually seemed to perturb their large host in a new way. How the hell are you still alive?

Edgar clenched his hands, trying to recall. We ranwe rodethrough another rift, without checking, exactly the way our Captain had just told us not to.

And then? Ward studied his face.

Feeling a high note of tension screeching at the back of his brain, he looked down at his pants. One pair, eight years prior, had no cargo pockets. His current pair, now, did. He reached down and pulled out his journal, recalling his drill sergeants insistent lesson. Flipping through, he found the last page of writing.

---

They didnt follow. Nobody followed. Feel strange. We all feel strange. Thirsty, hungry, at random. Angry, at random. Sad, staring into space. The Sun does not work right here, but its not like Bills beach. The sky

---

A terrible noise snapped him out of his reading. It was as if something huge and metal nearby had suddenly decided to rend and fall. Gunfire followed.

Ward Shaw stood, his hard brow stone grim. The entity thats hunting you*its here.*

Edgar stood, listening. His heart hammered against his ribcage, but his mind was already steps ahead, calculating their next few actions like any one of his games.

Rachel grabbed his hand. Get us out of here.

Nodding, and putting his terror aside, he pulled her into the hallway after Ward, who had already retrieved a handgun and radio to begin coordinating a defense. The giant did not leave them, and instead opted to follow and guard them. He did not correct Edgar on the path back outthere was no need.

Rushing with a sense of success on remembering the entire way, Edgar led his two companions into the open air outside the compound. His euphoria was short-lived, however, as the darkness of the sky above hit home. Half-bruised, it ran with streaming tendrils of dark purple. He stopped in place, gazing up in horror. There was one purple sky in his tales.

Mortars added to the sound of gunfire to their left. Men shouted angrily and ran past in tight formations, automatic weapons readied.

Ward looked down at the two of them. Something the matter, Brace?

Edgar touched around his own eyes and cheeks to make sure they remained uninjured. No, the intensity of the purple sky was still growingit had not yet reached its daily peak, and not yet reached the strength it had once held in a fractured world on the border of the Shield. He almost fell, but Rachel caught him. We had no idea, he forced himself to explain. It was just past dawn. It looked normal. The purple only started making itself apparent once we were too far in to escape.

What is it? Rachel asked, nearly crying. Whats the purple?

He looked to his right.

Noah Fulmer stood leaning against the wall of the compound, returning his gaze over a sea of barren dirt. He gave a single determined nod, and, then, his image vanished.

Edgar let the word fall out of his mouth, his inner hopelessness freed. Insanity.

What does that *mean?* she begged, beginning to fade from view.

He grabbed her wrist, and she solidified. He studied her face, joining her in letting tears flow down his cheeks. It means Im not really here. Its not really eight years ago. And I cant really change anything.

Ward gave a resigned sigh. Thats unfortunate.

I cant save anyone. I cant save you, Edgar choked out. Im probably wandering in the desert under that purple sky, and, soon, Ill start clawing my own eyes out. *We lost.* We fucked up, just like Kendrick said, and were all gonna die. In my case, alone, and tortured by my mistakes.

Rachel just breathed, her wide eyes betraying her understanding of what they would do together as a couple in just a few  years as fates worse than death seeped into the world all around themwhat he had been too scared to go through with after she already had. She knew now what he had done, because he knew what he had done, and she was just a figment of his hallucinations.

Im sorry, he sobbed, stumbling away from both of them. Leave me alone.

I dont feel like a hallucination, Ward murmured, gazing down at his hands as the raging battle grew closer. Dirt from an errant mortar showered him, and he brushed some out of his short hair. I feel like *Im* dreaming, and youre the illusion. What kind of insanity is it that youre caught in?

But Edgar kept running across the barren wastelands ahead, seeking refuge among the rocks and canyons of a place that had never held human life. He might be insane, he knew, but there was still *something out there.* As Rachel and Ward chased him, so too were they chased in turn by an amorphous darkness whose footsteps echoed in his head with the sounds of gravel and sand. The gunfire faded; those soldiers had never been real in the first place.

But they *had* delayed the wastelands evil. How was that possible? If it was, in some fashion, on the same mental plane as the insanity energies here

Looking down at his hands, Edgar summoned up hatred. His hate was for himself, for his broken promise, and for the coming death of his squadmates by self-mutilation, but the source of his hatred did not matter. Only its target mattered, and that target was existence itself, for all the torturous doom it held over life.

He took that hate, molded it with his thoughts, and pressed it into the shape of a sword made of impossibly cold ice.

Ward came around a high rock carrying Rachel. He dodged a surprise slash from that sword of ice, put her down, and peered back. Its coming. It seems to know where you are no matter where you go.

Edgar lowered his weapon, aghast that hed almost sliced his illusionary girlfriend. Are you alright?

She nodded at first, but then shook her head. No, she said, whimpering. Its terrible. The future. And now, to see you here, like this, knowing what youre going to do to yourselfI wish I could be a dreamstealer, like the one from those stories, and come back to the world with you. But I know theres nothing I can do, except forgive you.

His sword of hatred began to melt in his hands. Stunned, he let his mouth hang open before he finally managed to speak. What? But how could you? I

I know, she said quickly, feeling the darkness approaching. I know what you did, and what you constantly blame yourself for. But it doesnt matter. Youve suffered far more than I ever did. I made the choice I did to escape that suffering, and Im alright with that. Youve had to go on, and on, and onalone. Look what youre doing. Look at the mission youre on. Staying alive *was the braver choice.*

The last drops of his hate steamed away, leaving him defenseless.

Ward leapt forward, attempting to grapple with the oncoming dark figure, but he passed right through. From behind, he shouted, Edgar Brace! Your mission is too important. **Do whatever it takes to survive!**

This close, he could finally see the approaching shape. Surrounded by an aura of night, it was humanoid, and vaguely female. Pale skin ran smoothly along a misshapen and hairless body. It was tall, elegant, and utterly without empathy. It stalked forward, unblinking black irises set in bloodshot red focused directly on him.

Whatever it takes, he panted, noting the scant moments before it would reach him. He turned to the once love of his life. RachelI cant accept your forgiveness.

She gulped, her brown eyes full of sadness.

This pain is what keeps me going. Its why Im even out here. The ice reformed in his hand as he clenched his self-loathing tight. Im more sorry than I can ever tell you. The sword took shape, glistening violet under the purple sky, and he stabbed her in the chest. The ice slid through without resistance.

She fell to the ground, lifeless, blood leaking from a bullet hole in her right temple.

Hefting his hate made manifest, he turned to face his pursuer.

As he turned fully around, its pale ivory nose met his.

He was too late.

He was always late. That was his curse.

He stared into its black irises for a long moment, face to faceliterally. This close, its aura of darkness began to enshroud him, chilling his limbs.

Raising his own form of cold, he stabbed with his sword.

The creature dodged aside on spindly legs, leaving the darkness with him.

Slowly losing function in his limbs, he fought desperately, keeping it at bay for as long as his strength would let him. Ward Shaws words echoed in his thoughts: **Do whatever it takes to survive.**

But the creeping chill took him, and he fell next to Rachel, splashing her pooled blood to either side.

Suddenly graceful and calm, the creature crept above him, staring into his eyes once more. It tilted its head, studying him. After a moments deliberation, it began pressing down on his arms and legs.

Furious, angry, and bitter, Edgar struggled fruitlessly to move.

The creature began dragging him.

No prayers, he told himself. God didnt reside out here, if anywhere. No, he had to do this on his own, had to stay sharp, had to escapea maw opened in the cliff face, a cave, a lair. By sheer force of will, screaming in his head, he curled his fingers. Curl, uncurl, curlpushing control back into his limbs.

The caves natural darkness surrounded him, and he knew that he was too late.

But light resided within. Sunlight.

Shooting up from the deepest waters of the mind, he soared into open mental air and gasped for breath. Tied up. He was tied up. Ropesand numbness. The numbness was real. He was doubly restrained; physically, and chemically. That chemical effect, though, was beginning to wear off. He really was being dragged, too. The rough ground hurt his back as it scrolled underneath him.

Feeling his true vision return, he stared up at a bluish-red evening sky alive with sunsets dance. Confused, he looked around. His squadmates lay scattered all around, tied up in ropes just like him. Was this that horrible mind controlling woman in the forest again? Kendrick and Bill had tied him up that night, too.

Forcing his mouth to work, he managed to slur, What happening

But the others were also groggy, and still waking from insanity.

He managed to lift his head just a little bit, and he saw an open rift not twenty feet away. Beyond, a purple sky dominated, fully casting eye-gouging insanity over the world they had somehow left behind. As he watched, a figure approached from the other side, dragging another tied-up body.

The paralyzed person being dragged was blondePixley. It was Jennifer Pixley. He could only see the silhouette of the creature dragging her, but its head *was* smooth, and dimly reflecting the purple sky above.

The creature was real.

Holy shit, the creature was real!

Struggling to overcome his paralysis, he pushed against the ropes that held him tight. Wake up!

He screamed again. Guys, wake up!

Kendrick! *Kendrick!*

But Kendrick was completely out. He would have to have been totally out of it, Edgar realized, or else he could have used his artificial arm to tear his ropes right off. Guessing that, the creature must have given extra powerful paralysis to their Captain. Who else seemed most resistant to mental effects?

Bill! Edgar screamed, squirming with all his might. Bill!

Finally, a response came from somewhere to his right. Uah waoh whats going on? Brace?

I dont know! he screamed. We were in an insanity world, but somethings dragged us out! His hallucinations came back to him all at once, and he thought of someone who was still alive. Mona!

Im here, she gasped, somewhere to his left.

He laughed with relief before groaning in fear. Oh God, what are we gonna do?

Die, I think, she said softly. Play dead!

They all hushed suddenly as the creature came within hearing distance.

Edgar watched through barely open eyes as Pixley was dumped next to him. At that, he finally saw what had saved them, and he almost spoke out.

It was Lian.

Although his body did not shiver, his soul did. There was no creature. Lian had paralyzed each of them with her poisons, tied them up to keep them from hurting themselves, and then dragged them out of the insanity reality one by one*but how?* 

The truth hit him in the gut as he recalled Alek Staleys tale.

Certain threats could make a sane person lose their mind, but those same insanity threats often had an odd habit of making those already insane whole instead. Whether it was a conflict of energies, or a weird consolation prizewhen madness loomed, only madmen could walk with purpose.

Which meant that Lian

Thats everyone, the bald, bandaged, and bruised Chinese girl muttered to herself. She remained on her knees near Jennifer, rocking back and forth. Everyone out, everyone safe. She sobbed. I dont want to go back. I was free. I was free. Its coming back. I feel. I feel. I love you. I love you all. I love you, Bill. Kendrick. Carmen, oh, Carmen. Im sorry about your daughters. Youre such a wonderful woman; I wish thatd never happened to you. Jennifer, Randy, Mona. Ive never had true girl friends before. Cheng, you shouldnt feel bad about your family. You wont be the last Yao. Life goes on. And Edgar, you and Mona are perfect. Why are you so oblivious?

He opened his mouth, surprisedand worriedbut she didnt wait for a response.

I was free. I was alright. But its going away. I dont wanna go back. I felt it. I felt it. I felt what its like to be normal. It was beautiful. Her hands shook, and she began crying openly. So many times back and forth She gazed over at the rift. Im all messed up. Ive lost control. I used to be so in control.

Edgar opened his eyes to watch her more fully.

Lian drew her knife.

The silence ended, and the other awake squad members began shouting in fear and concern.

Lian! Bill yelled, loudest of all. Lian, what the hell are you doing?

She didnt respond. Instead, she crawled over to him and sat on her knees, her knife tracing his chest.

Men and women writhed and fought against their ropes, screaming at her and to each other. Panicked, Edgar strained against his bindings. His dose of poison was already wearing off, and he felt like he might actually escape if he just tried hard enough. Where was his sword of ice when he needed it?

Inside him. It was there, inside him, giving him cold and sharp focus. Strength welled up in his core.

Darkness hung on Lians face, hiding her shame. Her knife sliced Bills collarbone ever so slightly.

Lian, stop, Bill breathed, oddly calm. You dont need to do this. You do have control. I thought there was something dark in you, maybe, after your conversation with that monster in the woods; how you told it about justifying why its not pure evil. I kept thinking: why did it shift into your form? I thought it was because it was what I wanted, but then I thoughtwhat if it was mirroring what *it* wanted?

The knife slid along his ear, not cutting, but anticipating cutting.

It wanted to reflect what you were, he guessed aloud, speaking quickly. If you could live with yourself, so could it. I see that now, as Ive been laying here. And I want you to knowI forgive you.

Edgar did not stop struggling to get out of his ropes, but part of him did take pause. Around him, the moment seemed to slip right by his squadmates; they continued screaming and squirming.

Lian said nothing. Instead, she crawled away from Bill, taking up position on her knees over Carmen.

You dont scare me, the woman said, defiant.

The knife touched mockingly along her tummy.

You fucking bitch, Carmen spat, her demeanor igniting with fury. Dont you dare! Ill kill you! Even if its from beyond the grave, Ill rip your fucking skull from your spine!

I wouldnt, Lian whispered, rocking back and forth for a moment. I wouldnt. She crawled further, resting the point of her knife on Jennifers forehead. The blonde remained unmoving and unconscious.

A strange sort of sadistic evil became apparent in Lians eyes, and that same evil expressed disappointment that her victim was not awake to experience terror. She looked around at the squirming potential victims all around, like a spider surveying her cocooned prey, until one caught her eye. Skittering over, she pressed the edge of her knife gently into brown skin, drawing blood and eliciting a high-pitched scream of terror. Lian turned her head to peer over. Why do you hold back from Mona, Edgar?

He said nothing, instead focusing all his hate into sharpening his mental blade as Mona continued screaming in pain. From that focus, an idea was born. Me first.

The demon in Lian grinned. Oh?

I do care about her! he shouted, desperately hoping he could pull her over. If you have to torture someone, torture *me!* Not her!

Edgar, no! Mona insisted,  but he did not relent.

Lian climbed along her web of victims and put her face against his, just like that creature in his hallucinations. He understood now why he had seen her that way: his animal instincts had known something was off about her. And that, too, was how she had found him in the wastelands: she was an experienced predator.

She traced the knife across his stomach, her eyes alive with anticipation. Will you scream?

He noddedand forced his stomach and arms up against her, catching the knife between his hands. In her struggle to free the blade, his wrists poured forth bloodand the rope around his hands came apart.

Shooting up, he struggled with the smaller girl, hitting her forcefully on the bullet wound on her arm, and then on the autopsy slice in her forehead. Both bandages fell away, leaking crusted gore, and she rolled in the dirt. His legs were still bound, but he climbed on top of her, using his body weight to keep her down. His hands found her slender throat, and visions of her hurting Mona flooded his awareness.

Lian didnt struggle. In fact, she nodded as best she could, urging him on.

Edgar, stop! Youve got her!

It was Mona, asking for him to spare her. Why? Why would she say that?

He saw visions of Rachel lying on the floor of their shared bedroom, blood leaking from her head. The smell of gunsmoke came to his senses, but he couldnt bring himself to pick up the gun from her clenched hand. Outside, on the street, the sound of black spheres drilling into peoples heads echoed. He could either have a bullet in his brainor one of those spheres, piloting his body from inside his skull.

Or he could run. He could run away. There was a chance he might make it.

*Edgar!*

He couldnt hear Rachel anymore. No, Mona. That was her name. But did it matter? They were both just as dead. One death simply hadnt happened yet.

An exceedingly strong force pulled him up and away, throwing him to the barren earth. In a fatigued rush, he tightened his sleeves to stem the bleeding from his wounded wrists. He held his fingers there while fighting off a momentary dizziness; coming back to his senses, he stared up at Kendricks towering form. The strong-jawed man did not look happy, but his furious judgment was focused on Lian. How long?

Gasping for breath, the prone girl sobbed, Always.

Christ, Kendrick muttered, breathing hard. Ignoring her for a moment, he stepped around, untying his squadmates. One by one, each stood.

Edgar waited, crumpled, until Mona came over and helped him up. She gave him a glare, but it was tempered by understanding. He joined the other seven standing members of his squad as they circled around Lian, who remained in a fetal position, sobbing.

Randy was the first to finally break the tense silence. What do we do? 

Kill her, Carmen said immediately, furious. What the hell *was* that? Shes crazy!

Rubbing her arms to push out the numbness, Jennifer offered up a defense. Maybe the purple sky reality messed with her head.

Bill kneeled down on one knee to hold Lians hand. That has to be it. Shes never tried to hurt anyone before.

Cheng seemed to realize something. Shes got poisons on her, poisons she gathered herself. Her story about her time alone on Amber Twowe have no way of knowing what she was really doing in the city.

Lian herself spoke up, even as she moved into a sitting position to confess. I was looking for someone to torture and kill so that I wouldnt take my need out on any of you.

That stunned everyone into silence all over again. Edgar took a step back.

Lian stood, but meekly, her hand still in Bills. She actually seemed relieved. Ive never told anyonebut Im broken. My emotions, my insides, they dont work like yours seem to. Nothing bothers me, nothing mattersuntil I *need* to hurt someone to feel in control again. She lowered her bruised head. But I love you all, in a way I didnt think was possible for me. Im sorry for what Ive done here.

Kendrick studied her sincerity. Whats changing? A few minutes ago, you were pure darkness. Why are you calm now?

She turned her head to look away on the ground. I was just messed up from going back and forth so many times. Im in control again. She paused. Being in there was amazing, though. Ill always remember what it felt like to be normal. Its a treasure Ill keep with me as long as I live.

Im glad for you, Carmen said, her anger lowerbut not much lower. Youre still a threat to this entire squad.

Actually, Mona countered, visibly not liking her own argument. Shes also an asset. If we hit insanity realities, like that one, shell only get more clear-headed. She literally just pulled us out on our asses.

Still on fire with adrenaline, Edgar looked among the faces of his squadmates, wondering if they were really going to have this conversation.

Apparently, they were. She says shes in control again, Bill insisted. Dont kick her out.

This doesnt seem safe, Cheng said softly.

For her part, Randy seemed to reluctantly agree with Mona. She might actually have been chosen to be here specifically to get us through threats like this.

Statistics. That point hit Edgar somewhere deep. Had this team been put together like this on purpose? Had the higher-ups *known* about Lian?

We cant kick her out, Jennifer said, worried. Its *Lian*, guys.

Lians a lie, Carmen told her. She shifted her furious glare. Arent you?

Lian nodded shamefully. I never knew my grandfather. It was only ever just me.

Kendrick raised his hands diplomatically, clearly trying to bring some sense to the discussion. Do you guys actually want some sort of serial killer to stay in our ranks?

Well have to be on guard, Cheng said. Not just from outside threats, but from her.

Lian looked around with wide eyes at each of them. Id kill myself before I hurt any of you.

Overcome by an idea, Edgar frowned. He ran over Ward Shaws words again and again: **do whatever it takes to survive.** The man had been a hallucination, but his image had still been based on his personality in the heroic tales, and hed been absolutely right. Looking around, he saw that Lian had already retrieved their motorcycles and their supplies. Shed disarmed them to keep them from hurting themselves; a smart move. Stalking over to the bikes, Edgar searched for his gun.

	<TEXT> The dense underbrush and tangled trees gave way without warning, and Bill Nash pulled his and Lians machines up short in the beginnings of sand. The world ended abruptly ahead, but he had no eyes for that gorgeous emerald-watered vista. His bald and battered squadmate lay unconscious across the handlebars of her bike.

Emerging from the West Coast jungle a few feet to the right, Merrill quickly scanned the beach, took off his helmet, and affirmed the idea. Thisll have to do.

Quickly but firmly grabbing Lian alongside Brace, Bill helped carry her to the sand, where Wygant was already setting up a blanket and opening up one of the squads medical kits. After laying the unconscious Chinese girl in their makeshift triage area, Bill stood back and fought a pained tension in his jaw. Why would they beat the shit out of her? Cut into her skull like that?

Wygant donned a pair of glasses and shook her head as she probed Lians injuries with careful fingers. Pixley kneeled beside her, laying out bandages and tools in a practiced fashion.

Noticing the aura of intent medical staff, Bill retreated a bit to where the others were standing and watching with worried eyes.

Ellwoods face held a green tint under her red hair, and she fought back visible nausea to speak. If people were like engines, Id fix her right up

Its alright, Merrill told her, his eyes grim. Shes not bleeding too badly.

Brace tied his hair back to keep it from whipping in the strong ocean winds coming in off of the emerald waters. He sighed. Its not the outer bleeding that might get her. From that kind of beating, itll be internal bleeding, or just simple infection.

Yao and Faulkner sat behind Bill on a rock and looked on. It looked like the Hispanic woman was praying silently. Yao watched the triage area with an empty expression, but his hand tightly held hers. Bill noted this and looked away. Part of him wanted to rush over and hold Lians hand, but the man in him resisted. That was not the bond he had with her. Whatever they might have shared, it was all surface level and hollow. Hed assumed he just wasnt good enough to warrant more than that, and hed armored himself yet again against needy thoughts.

Nah. He surreptitiously watched Merrill and Ellwood whispering to each other. Men like Merrill got girls. Ellwood was plain and boyish, but

He turned his gaze away to avoid jealous thoughts. The issues were all around. He could tell that it was going to be a Bad Day.

The ocean ran sleek out to the horizon, and glittered darkly under the morning sun. He narrowed his eyes. What time was it?

Shes stable, Wygant said softly. The bullet isnt in her arm, so stitches and a bandage will have to do.

The bioglue looks like its working, Pixley added, studying Lians forehead wound and its new bubbled line of white goo. What did they do? Take a saw to her head?

And why? Merrill asked.

Wygant shook her head again. Well just have to wait until she wakes up.

We might not have time. Search her while shes out. I dont think theyre after us, but any information will help.

Yes, sir.

As the tension of crisis left the squad, its members became looser and began moving. Seeing this, Bill quickly chopped some wood from the vegetation nearby and brought it to start a fire.

---

10:43 PM 9/30/15: Its strange how growing up dirt poor taught me skills that would one day help me be useful out in the untamed multiverse. I wonder if I might always have been meant for this. Or, like Brace always says, was it just statistics? Did the higher-ups make a list of super-specific attributes and, as he says, *find it in the untold billions of humanity purely by the weight of numbers?*

If Brace is right, have we all been carefully chosen? Was this squad built with great care and cunning? Hah, no. Of course this team was randomthey thought Randy was a man on account of her name!

---

He put his journal and pen into a side pocket on his fatigues and adjusted his sitting position in the sand, his near-realization lost. Insistent sea breezes tore at his anxiety, leaving him floaty and calmbut, as evinced by later journal entries, part of him would still cling to certain suspicions.

Beside him, Lian began to stir. She squeezed her eyes shut hard, and then slowly sat up. What time is it?

He smiled and helped her find a good sitting position. Like two in the morning.

She frowned painfully and blinked. Whys it daytime?

Got me.

I have to make a journal entry... She pulled her journal out of her backpack, which had been placed nearby.

Squads expectin to hear what happened, too, he told her.

She hesitated, pen in hand. After a long moment, she asked, They dont know? She wrote furiously for a few moments, and then reached down by her waist, where her hand stilled.

Missing something? Bill asked, seeing her pause.

A smile arced up along her cheeks. No, not at all.

There it was again, Bill thoughtthat insulting hollowness. There was just something *missing* behind her smile, and he knew it had to be because he just wasnt worth wasting genuine emotion or honesty. Tingling with anger, he smiled back. Im glad youre alright.

She groaned. I feel like I got hit by a

He stood. Welp, Ive got to check the fire.

Brought up short, she looked over, where the rest of the squad sat circled in the sand. You sat with me.

It was his turn to hesitate. Her statement wasnt a question, request, or accusation. Shed simply stated something directly from her inner thoughts without context, and he didnt know how to react. Yeah. He took one step, but then added, Happy to. He took another step, and then turned back again. Also, youre bald now.

Her eyes went wide as she remembered, and her hands shot up to her smooth head. Damnit!

He finally moved toward the fire, confused. Merrill, Pixley, and Wygant passed him on their way to see their newly awakened squadmate, and he watched them talk from his new spot.

They found a hidden pouch full of poisons on her, Brace murmured.

That caused Bill to double-take, and he immediately thought of her hand pausing by her waist. What do you mean? he asked, already knowing half the answer.

Somebodylikely hersewed a hidden pouch into her uniform. It held a bunch of natural poisonous plants and chemicals probably found along the way.

Bill studied the expressions on the fire-lit faces around him. Yao, Faulkner, Brace, Ellwoodall four were deadly serious. What are we thinking that means? he finally asked, trying to stay calm and neutral even as his thoughts spun wildly. He imagined everyone elses thoughts were spinning much the same way.

Brace had no answer.

Bill held still for a moment, fighting a strange sensation coursing along his spine. Itd been happening for quite some time already, making his emotions a bit swingier and his senses slightly dull, but he finally noticed it. Somethings going on.

Yeah, Ellwood replied, throwing a hand toward the quiet interrogation. She might not be

No, he interrupted, standing and fighting a subtle dizziness. We gotta go.

Taking his concern seriously, the redhead stood. She swayed in place ever so gently, and then she knew that he was right. Yao leapt to his feet and pulled Faulkner up by a hand, and Brace staggered up after.

Bill watched them race to their bikes. None had shared a word, but they knew what to do. He turned and shouted at the others, and his voice came out distorted. Gggguuuuyyysss Merrill, Pixley, and Wygant all turned as one to stare at him. A moment later, they each seemed to notice that something was wrong, and they quickly grabbed the gear all around and helped Lian over toward the bikes incredibly quickly.

Moving after them with the feeling of a dream, like moving in slow motion or in sludge, Bill ran at a snails pace. Frustrated, he snarledand a heavy green vine fell across his shoulder. Someone had made a makeshift rope and thrown it from blurs that now danced around the edges of his senses, and he grabbed it tightly.

A tremendous yank pulled him forward, and he slid across gritty sand, suddenly freed.

Come on! No time! *Just run!* Merrill shouted in his face, and Bill got up and dashed to his yellow-trimmed bike under evening twilight. To his left, a sickly rolling fog washed over their former campsite, and the two men raced away from it.

What just happened? he gasped, donning his helmet and kicking up to speed without delay. The others rolled along the wet sand near the dark ocean waters, not sparing more than a look or two back to see that he was alright. They had to keep their eyes ahead.

It was Brace who responded over the radio first. We can only guess you got caught in a bubble of slow time.

Slow time? he asked, already believing the answer. How is that possible?

No clue, but its a good thing you sensed it forming.

Merrill cut in. Top speed, guys. We have to get the hell out of here. Risking death is all well and good, but we cant burn any more time.

So were going north along the beach? Faulkner asked.

Yeah. It doesnt matter which direction we go, really, since its crossing distance and realities that matters. Our going will be quicker on open sand rather than on hills and mountains.

Shaking off the strange after-effects on his senses, Bill commented, Crossing the Rockies is easy when you can just go into another reality whenever you hit a big mountain.

True that, Merrill responded. Ive neverwait, everybody hold up!

As one, they came to a sudden stop, and each of them saw the letters written in the star-lit sand. In apparent dark blue and grey, *OOP* lay carved by some unknown writer.

To their right, from the vegetation, fog began rolling in. The order to keep going came quickly, and they raced away from it without more than idle conjecture. Theyd seen so many strange things on their journey, sudden thick fog was just another fleck of weird on a sea of strange. Without any indication of the intent of the message in the sand, they were forced to continue on.

Bill Nash realized that he still felt a little off. The last few hoursor day? Or however long?had all felt wrong. He seemed to be floating along through events with either sharpened emotions or less than usual, and his senses felt partially detached from him in a way he couldnt describe. Were the others feeling this way? It was like being drunk, but without the fun parts

Only minutes later, they stopped againthis time near motorbike tracks.

Another squad? Faulkner asked.

Merrill stared down. Theyre definitely like ours.

Brace swore. Theres a chance theyre *exactly* like ours.

Time loop? Wygant asked, on edge.

*OOP* in the sand, he responded, clutching his fists. One of us must have written *TIME LOOP* in a previous iteration, and high tide washed part of it away.

Lets not jump to conclusions, Ellwood countered. There *are* other squads out here.

Ive seen all the science fiction, Brace told her. All of it. Well be much better off if we assume were in a time loop immediately.

Merrill kicked the tracks angrily. We dont have time for this shit! How do we get out of it?

Bill cut in. How did you guys get me out the first time?

Ellwood took off her helmet to grin. Built a pulley system and found a heavy vine to yank you out.

Feeling whispers of other and past conversations repeat in his head, he conveyed what a grey-haired but still-fiery Randy had once told himwould someday tell him. Just build another pulley system like that once were out. Or anything that provides an exit. If were looping in time, the exit should already be here, right?

From the trees, that inexplicable fog began rolling in a third time.

It was Faulkner who said it. Our natural instincts are to run away from that, right? We would ride away from it every single time.

Lets do the opposite, Brace said, completing her unspoken idea.

Screw it, Merrill ordered. I dont really understand whats going on, but I trust you guys. Lets ride into that horrible fog.

Nine bikes carved curved trails in the sand, and Bill gripped his handlebars tight as the warm fog grew heavier around him. The weird feeling in his head shifted smoothly from high to low as they progresseduntil they emerged from a wall of mist in forest underbrush. Ahead of them, a grey-haired woman stood and whooped success over a vast array of steam-producing arrays built of wood, fire, water, and converted bikes.

Randy? Merrill asked, shocked, as the squad came to a halt. Can you explain whats going on?

Dont worry about it, dumbass, the old woman cackled.

In an anti-climactic moment of un-noise, she was gone. Her machines and the steam were simply not there the next moment, and the trees subtly changed shape all around.

Merrill seemed exasperated. Can somebody explain this?

Brace shook his helmeted head. We gotta go, sir. Get us to a rift right away.

Feeling woozy, Bill followed, sticking close to Lian by instinct. Trampling bushes and skirting trees, the squad made for the nearest rift, and piled through to the other side, where a wonderfully non-descript clearing awaited.

In one big thud, Bill felt normalcy return, and he pulled off his helmet just in time to puke onto the leaf-covered ground. The others took off their helmets, too, and gathered around to make sure he was alright.

Somebody, Merrill stated flatly. Explain what the hell that was.

Well never know, Brace told him, while Wygant nodded. A reality with fractured time, a naturally occurring localized disruption? Its impossible to say.

We must have gotten very lucky then, the confused former farmhand said. 

No, Ellwood added, her gaze distant. A lifetime of hard work got you out.

Got *us* out.

Yeah

Bill overheard all this while fighting nausea.

Pixley rubbed his back while he remained bent over. How did you sense what was happening?

Ive no idea, he groaned.

How did you know thered be an exit? she asked, her tone concerned as he retched again.

He wiped his mouth and sighed with relief as the dizziness began to fade. Randyum, Ellwood told me. Old Ellwood, that nagging bitch.

The blondes hand hesitated on his upper back. When?

He blinked. The memories faded even as he grasped at them. Thered been a time when hed been old and infirm, but still harassed every day by the obsessed former redhead to pursue building her cockamamie machines. But when had that happened? I dont know

Its not going to make sense, Brace said, coming over to help him back to his bike alongside Pixley. Well never know anything but the first little bit, since the rest happened in enormous branches of possible timelines that looped back in on each other. Evidently, some among us would never give up, not even after decades. He glanced at Ellwood, who remained distant and lost in thought. Of those events that happened in years upon years unknown, we can only guess.

Merrill shouted a curse word loudly. What day is it? What time?

Nobody could be sure. Their watches all read the same day and time, but those clocks had been on their wrists the entire time.

We have to figure out how much time we lost, he grunted, holding back anger and tension. It cant have been too long, right? We only experiencedI dont know

A half-day, maybe a day? Faulkner thought aloud.

Something like that. Merrill scanned the clearing. We can never let our guard down like that again. The Thompson doctrine states that every world has its own form of existential danger happening all the time, slowly or quickly, but present all the same. He breathed out slowly. Well have to hope this one is on the slow side. He stood in place by his bike and looked at Lian. Well, go ahead.

The bald and battered Chinese girl touched her jacket to tighten the zipper by her neck a little further. It was Amber Two.

Eight voices said the same word at once: *What?*

She nodded weakly. That world was Amber Two, and they were willing to go to any length to hide that fact. They wanted us to think they were just a random unaffiliated reality that happened to have humans in it.

After a moment of stunned silence, the group all spoke at once.

Thats impossible, Wygant said, her dark eyes electrified by some hidden thought.

I thought the Amber worlds were all destroyed? Pixley asked.

The reports, Yao told her, for once animated with emotion. I heard the whole story at the camps. Two Amber worlds exploded from Shield generation stress, and the other eight were all crushed and sent into the Void to sweep up the inter-reality dust that caused the Crushing Fist.

How did they survive? Faulkner wondered aloud, clutching her chest. Does that mean other people could have survived?

Brace gripped his forehead. Why would Command lie to us? Or is it possible they dont know that Amber Two escaped destruction?

Is the Crushing Fist still a danger? Ellwood asked herself, coming back from her distant state of mind. It couldnt be, could it?

Bill looked to all of these people, his true concern focused on the other topic that had yet to be broached. Politics and Big Damn Heroes didnt matter to him. People matteredand there was one among them who had a secret; one among them whom he cared about in a conflicted and painful manner.

A single firm statement stopped all the discussions. The poisons, Lian, Merrill stated. His hard gaze did not waver.

Standing there apart from the group, bald, bruised, and bandaged, Lian looked small and vulnerable. Im not a fighter, she said quietly. Ive had to protect myself in the past. Her gaze drifted to the right. And Im well aware of the dangers out here. When they came for me, I took some, trying to kill myself.

Murmurs passed around the circled squad.

It didnt work, she continued, somehow seeming to shrink even further into herself. It just paralyzed me for a timeand I felt everything. The hands of men. I couldnt stop them. And then the beating, the autopsy

Enough, Merrill said, shivering with empathy. Thank you for explaining.

The others touched and hugged Lian, but Bill stood back. Her words had been descriptive enough, but vague in perfect ways. Hed already become sensitive to the hollowness of her smile and conversations with him, but this was the same as those small moments. How could talk of *implied* sexual assault, and of a provable beating and autopsy without specified motiveshow could those words also be subtly hollow? Her motions and stance and tone had all been spot on, but

Something landed on his hand, and he brushed it away. Goddamn mosquitoes, he muttered.

It landed again, and he realized it was bigger than a mosquito. Looking down, he saw a strange articulated insect the color of cherry oak. He hit it away again with vehemence, and looked up.

The one that had touched him floated up and around, joining a swarm coming in over the treetops. The cloud of cherry oak colors flitted in and out of his awareness like he was having trouble seeing them, but his eyes were functioning normally. Guys.

The others kept talking.

Guys, do you see those?!

His squadmates looked around and followed his gaze, but then shook their heads. Only Brace kept lookingat him. Do you see something, Bill?

Yeah, Edgar, and Im having trouble focusing on them or thinking about them.

Them? Brace ran a hand along his tied-back hair, trying to focus himself. His eyes lit up. Perception filter! Damn were a good team, buddy!

Perception filter? somebody asked.

Its hard for us to notice or think about *them,* Brace explained, looking up and finally seeing the approaching cloud. Holy shit!

His alarm tipped the others off, and the squad noticed at the last moment. Donning their helmets and kicking off, they sped into the woods.

Bill climbed on his bike and followed after, swatting away the strange brown insects that had come near him. The more he looked at them, the more his brain perceived, and he was starting to think that they looked a bit *mechanical*. Each cherry oak mechanical insect seemed to flitter and morph about like an otherworldly hummingbird. While racing along between the trees, he reached down and tried to put on his helmet, but one got a bite in on his cheek before he managed to do so.

Screaming in pain at the sudden stabbing sensation, he used one free hand to pull a jagged metal barb from his cheek. He moved to throw it awaybut thought better of it. He slid it into his pocket and put on his helmet as the swarm surrounded him.

They flitted up against him, even landed on him, but no further stings followed. They tapped against his helmet, trying to reach his cheek. Failing that, they took off, and the cloud surged ahead. He took that as a sign. Guys, they only sting your cheek! Make sure your helmets are on, and tight!

Roger that, Pixley said, speaking for those ahead.

Bill, speed up, Merrill added. Were almost to the next rift. Can you see us?

He gazed ahead through the trees. Ive got eyes on Ellwoods bike. He looked down, and saw something in the webbed skin between his thumb and index finger. Um, Ive also got an eye on my hand.

What?

The angry red eye stared back at him from his hand as little crimson chrome veins that looked like wires began growing from it into his skin. Yeah, he radioed, another bout of sickness rising up in him. Im havin a bad day here.

Finding the rift and cycling through it at top speed, he came to an abrupt halt on the other side and fell to the rocky desert ground beyond. The hard-to-perceive swarm of strange insects still clouded on the other side, but did not follow.

Wygant and Pixley laid him on his back and studied his hand.

Oh no, the blonde murmured, seeing the eye in his hand. He wasnt kidding.

Take off his helmet, Wygant told someone, and Yao came over and assisted.

Dizzy, cold, and shaking, Bill tried to hold onto consciousness as spikes of pain shot through his awareness. My cheek, he choked out. It stabbed my cheek.

The two women probed his cheek bone, spoke quietly to each other, and donned grim expressions.

Do you still have the stinger? Wygant asked.

Bill forced himself to nod through paralyzing fuzziness.

Yao quickly searched his pockets and found it.

Staring up, he saw what hed pulled from his cheeka three-inch barbed mechanism that looked like an injector of some kind. 

Get up and kill everyone, Wygant told him.

He frowned through sweaty pain. What?

Pixley responded to his question. She said, get up and kill everyone.

Heart pounding in his chest, he shook his head. What? No!

You should, Yao whispered near his ear. Drag their bodies back over to the others while theyre still warm.

The others? he asked, enormously confused.

Yao looked over toward the rift, where the cloud of mechanical insects still circled. They cant follow, because theyd be out of power range. You need to bring fresh hosts to them.

Are you sure? he asked, completely lost, but willing to trust his squad. Is that the right thing to do?

Of course! Pixley told him, smiling down at him. Then theyll feed all those humans youre worried about.

They will?! he said woozily, smiling back. So we succeeded, then? Those insect thingies will feed everyone if I help them?

Absolutely, Wygant said with a grin. Here, bite down on this. She reached over, took a few wires from Ellwood, and held them forward. Bill traced those wires back to hastily built contraptions attached to the bikes. He lay confused for a moment, and then went to shout in terror, but someone had shoved a stick between his teeth.

Wygants grin widened, and she poked his chest.

Blazing fire seared through every nerve in his body. Sweat forced itself from every pore, his muscles seized wildly, and Bill Nash screamed at the top of his lungs through a reflexively clenched jaw on thick wood.

---

I saw a lot of things in that moment, a lot of things I never shared with my squadmates. The Crushing Fist didnt take anyone from me, because I already had nobody when it came. I buried my mother one day, or what was left of her after a Mimic got her, and that was that. People think life was all fun and games before the Crushing Fist brought in new monsters, but, the truth is, we already had our fair share. And they could never leave, never get out, because the Shield kept them trapped with us. Im sure they got bitter, mocking, even hateful because of that.

I buried her under the Sun. It didnt rain. Didnt even get cloudy. I sat by her grave and fuckin *nothin happened.* The world didnt care at all. The weather didnt reflect the tragedy like it does in movies. It just went about its business.

I told Lian something about feeling alone, that night we shared. I think she relates. She didnt want to talk about her grandfather, though.

Loneliness. That was what that moment held. Whatever eternities Id lived and forgotten earlier that day, the blank where theyd been came back. For decades, I was on fire. Every piece of me, skin, bone, eyes, on fire. Alone.

For decades.

---

He couldnt believe it when the pain finally subsided. Looking around through misty eyes, he saw his squadmates gathered all around. Wygant still held wires, and she poked forward again. He tried to shout, No! No! but the wood between his teeth muffled his words.

---

There are no words for the pain I felt in that second shock. It wasnt just the electricity. That horrible machine-insect put something in me, and it was being burned out of my nervous system, so Wygant tells me.

It didnt want to go easy. It kept me there for an eternity of searing shock agony. Honestly, I gave up all hope after endless years of it screaming at me while I burned alive.

---

His eyes rolled, but he slowly became aware again, and conscious of his situation. He wasnt fast enough to protest, to explain. Metal prongs touched his bare skin.

---



---

He had no words left in his head by the time consciousness found him again. Somebody had put him in his one-man tent and left him. His hand was bandaged up tightly, but he could feel that pieces had been burned and then cut out of him. Stickiness and squishiness moved under that bandage whenever he flexed his fingers, so he stopped flexing his fingers.

He wanted to go home. He had that urge, that need. His spirit had been painfully damaged, and he wanted his mother. He recalled stories of soldiers calling out for their moms as they lay dying. Was he dying? He just needed a word, just one single coherent word.

He remembered: he had no home. Goddamnit.

There was his word. His thoughts sprang back into action, and he clutched his hand and curled up in his tent as he began processing the pain, loneliness, and agony.

You awake? someone asked, from just beside his tent.

He wasnt alone. How was that possible? In a flash, he remembered his squadmates. Hed hung back, but they were there: a possible new family. Did someone else feel that way? Did someone else feel that way about *him?* He looked up at Lian, and repeated what she had told him lifetimes upon lifetimes ago. You sat with me.

Yeah, she said, mirroring his earlier words in kind. Happy to. She paused. Also, youre bald now.

He reacted instinctively, touching his headonly to find his quarter-inch-long hair still intact. He sighed, and relaxed. Those eternities of pain still hovered somewhere, but they had lost their claw-like hold on him. You bitch.

She smiled, and no hollowness hung behind her expression. I owed you one. She ran a hand along her own smooth head and turned away, but remained sitting near him.

He lay back in his tent and just breathed until Merrill found him.

Hows it going, bud? his captain-elect asked.

Ill be fine, he said after a cough, only half-lying. How much time did we lose camping here?

Dont worry about that, Merrill said, trying to cover up his anxious angry tension. It is important that youre alive, and can ride. Also, that youre not wanting to kill us and drag us somewhere.

No promises.

That made the other man laugh. Alright. Well head out in the morning. Just rest and recover. We cant have everyone getting the shit beat out of them all the time like this. Gotta be sharp, and on guard. He got up, then, nodded to Lian, and walked toward the nearby fire. Bill watched his slightly uneven gait, suddenly reminded of the horror that had happened to half of Merrills body. In comparison, having a weird robotic infection try to grow an eye in his hand and then take over his mind was nothing, right?

---

Feel like shit, but getting better. Were wasting too much time on injuries. Merrill wont say it, but I know hes thinking it. We might have to start leaving people behind. Will that start with me, if Im not good enough to ride tomorrow morning?

I dont want to be alone again, but I cant say Id blame them. Too much is on the line.

My hearings funny since the shocks, but I think I can hear somebody whispering. Are they whispering about me?

---

Bill Nash climbed out of his tent to find himself alone. Other tents lay by the fireempty. The whispering kept going, and it was stronger out among the open night beneath the trees, but he couldnt see the source. If he could just hear the words

Stop! For Gods sake, stop! Merrill shouted from somewhere distant.

Stumbling forward into the dark underbrush, Bill followed the sound of his distressed voice. Down a leafy hill and around a large tree, he caught sight of the squad walking blithely forward while their captain pushed at them and pulled at them and screamed for them to stop.

Where are they going? Bill asked, hurrying up despite a powerful fuzziness in his limbs.

No idea, Merrill said urgently, fighting with a blank-eyed Ellwood to keep her from walking deeper into the woods. Whispering started from somewhere, and they all just got up and started following it.

Terror hit him as he realized the situations danger was far deeper than it seemed. Mind control?!

The other man nodded. Go get rope. Help me pull them back and tie them up.

Sure thing. Running back to camp, Bill rooted through supply kits, dumping them to hasten the search. Finally, he found enough small ropes, and he ran much further than the first time to find the group. 

Together, the two men grabbed Ellwood and tied her to a nearby tree. The redhead struggled silently, but couldnt escape.

Wygant next, Merrill said. Medical expertise. We dont know how long we have until the whispering finds us. We might need her.

Right. Bill hesitated as he caught sight of an incredibly beautiful woman approaching between the trees. Dressed in flowing white gowns, she walked effortlessly among the shrubs, her eyes on him. Hey, there are other humans here!

What? Merrill looked around, aghast. No! Shes not real! Ignore her!

The whispers in his ears became stronger, and he finally heard them. *I know you feel lonely, but you dont have to be alone anymore. Ill always take care of you.*

It was exactly what he needed to hear; somehow, exactly what was always secretly gnawing at him. We should hear her out, he said, aware that his voice was quieting.

*Bill! For Gods sake, Bill! Snap out of it! Bill!* 

He heard his own name shouted, and he shook his head. Having already had another voice in his mind earlier that day, he recognized the feeling. Its a trick, isnt it? he asked, wavering in place.

Merrills face came right up against his. Yes, God, yes, it is! I need your help! Shes coming!

Its too much, Kendrick, he whispered, feeling his insides churning and his brain burning. This last assault felt like it was washing away something importantlike his soul was written in letters in sand, and the waters had finally gotten too high. Its too much for one day. I think Im gonna die.

Then die later, buddy, right after you help me with this.

Summoning up all his remaining willpower, he nodded. Alright, bud. Former farmhands unite.

Merrill backed off, breathing hard. Thats the spirit!

Running back and forth, they grabbed each loose member of the squad and tied them to different trees just in time to face the approaching apparition.

Bill eyed Yaos handgun.

Not yet, Merrill whispered as the white-clad woman entered their little clearing proper. Thompson doctrine, remember? Guns are exceedingly likely to be useless. Shes probably an illusion. Shes probably not even approaching from that direction

Bill realized it at the same time as his captain. Together, the two men stood back-to-back, spinning and scanning the dark forest by barest starlight.

A slithering mass of unseen flesh moved between the shrubs opposite the womans approach.

Are you sentient? Merrill shouted out into the chilly night.

The whispering intensified into a spoken female voice. **Now that is an odd question.**

Bill fought down another surge of inclination to submit. He had a true friend and a woman he cared about to protect, and the back pressed against his own kept him in place.

So, yes, Merrill said loudly, hiding the fear in his voice. Were peaceful explorers just scouting for food, and possibly a new home. We are not interested in a conflict.

The horror out in the woods waited, while the glowing white woman circled them and studied their sincerity. **You think your lack of interest in a conflict matters to me?**

Merrill let out a dismayed breath.

Mentally leaping at something, Bill cut in. Yes, of course it does!

The woman kept circling, and her gorgeous blue eyes turned darker as she took on the form of a familiar Chinese girl with long flowing black hair. Behind the image, the real Lian wearily came out of a daze and pushed at her bonds in surprise.

I like her better bald, Bill spat.

The false Lian laughed. **You want me to simply depart?**

Yes! both men said simultaneously.

Coming fully to her senses, the real Lian looked up at her hair-clad reflection. You *will* depart.

**You sound sure of yourself.** The illusion turned and faced her.

You will depart, Lian breathed, laboring against the mental pressure from the horror in the woods. Because youre sentient, as Kendrick asked. And we all share one thing in common, no matter whatwe have to live with ourselves. She pushed up against her ropes. You have to justify yourself, and you do that by letting some live. Not this one, because this one made you feel something. Not that one, because that one simply asked. You dont kill *everyone* you lure in. You let some live. That way, youre not pure evil. Thats your cognitive dissonance; thats how you justify not killing yourself.

The illusionary Lians face went cold. **If youre right, then youre remarkably astute. If youre right, youre also angering me.**

Seeing a small chance, Bill spilled out what his mind was screaming. Our entire tribe, he gasped. Our entire tribe is depending on *us* to find food, and a new home. Three hundred and fifty *billion* people. Im not lying.

**I know youre not lying,** the woman snapped. **How do you think I know your mental languages?**

The three awake members of the squad remained silent, waiting.

Against his back, Bill felt Merrill breathing hard in anticipation of a fight to the death. He could feel it: there was a hidden anger in that man; anger beyond understanding, anger at the utmost of human emotion. It boiled underneath his skin, just waiting to come out. Bill thought about what Merrill had said about his father and brothers dying at the Battle of the Capital Temple, and he wondered if this would be the moment that latent anger would find release. If so, it was likely the situation would not end well for anyonenot even their new enemy.

**Fine,** the illusion finally spat. **Im not going to endanger hundreds of billions. You people need to have less children.** *Hundreds* **of** *billions?* **That would just feel wrong somehow.** She began to vanish from the feet up as the strange writhing mass in the woods slithered off. **With this feeling, I believe you would depart saying: Assholes!**

Her image vanished completely, and the clearing went starlit dark.

*Dont* **be here tomorrow night.**

The grave-chill inside Bills chest faded with the departure of the unseen horror. After a few tense moments of breathing quietly and looking around, the three realized they were actually being left alone.

Surging with adrenaline and relief, Bill hurried over to Lian and began untying her while Merrill headed for the others. How did you know it lets some live? he asked, amazed.

Lian sat sober and restrained, even despite the release of her ropes. Good guess.

Despite the tension, he hugged her.

She hugged back, and hard. Im glad youre not like that man. Heartless, cold.

Man? he asked, letting go. I saw a woman.

Really?

The two found the other members of the squad and compared notes. Bill frowned as it came out that the women had all seen an illusionary man and heard male whispers, and the men had all heard female whispers and seen the woman in the white gown. It made sense that the predator had tailored her mental assault to each gender, but why hadnt Kendrick been affected? Hed seen a woman!

Judging by his journal entries, Bill Nash often had near-realizations that dissipated just before coming together. This was one of those moments, and he fell asleep with his entry on the matter unfinished.

There were no further mentions of that nights specific incident in his entries, because greater events would soon distract him. At that very moment, the tracks the squad had left on the beach that morning had just been found, and there were no active time snarls remaining to ensnare pursuers. Worse, the following day would bring the squad into the deadliest type of reality possible in our base branch. They would no longer number nine after escaping. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello small town mom,
/u/1000wph has great advice about how to approach your own work. On top of that, I would say that you should initiate individual conversations with authors, publishers, and reviewers that you respect. 95% of them might be too busy to talk, but the ones that do talk will be more than glad to answer intense industry-specific questions like these. It's not a competition. Every great author helps every other great author - because it's not author vs author, it's books vs movies vs videogames :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I use [Miller Creative Consulting](http://millercreativeconsulting.com/) for covers. I did my own before that, and, while I think they were alright, getting professional covers done was like leveling up my brand. They're also a pleasure to work with (full disclosure: I have worked alongside them on projects for other clients before).

I would say there are not places where artists will do covers for free. Not quality ones, anyway.

For promoting oneself, you're going to need a web presence. That includes one central location - your blog - with attached mailing lists. Facebook, Twitter, and everything else you can reasonably manage should all be connected back to it. You should also link to it from your books - take advantage of the electronic nature of the medium.

Once you have those inroads in place, just keep on producing quality content, publish it, and send it to reviewers and bloggers (politely). Ideally, anyone who hears of you should be able to directly zoom to your central location and learn more about you. And then buy from you. </TEXT>

If it's the formatting you're looking to tackle rather than the file format itself, I recommend downloading a slew of free e-books and more or less learning from their formatting. Modern trends are surprisingly minimalist, because e-books don't offer a ton of bells and whistles. </TEXT>

Lian Yen needed to kill someone.

*Stay in the background, but not too far in the background. Dont let them know what you are.*

She knew that. Stop lecturing her. She should be focused on penetrating the veils of secrecy the people here had drawn around their guests. The others sensed the layered fabrics of shadows and misdirection with which they had been surrounded, but she was a practiced seamstress. She recognized purposeful craft when she saw it. Most days, she would have picked the threads of those lies until they came apart and revealed the terrible truth beneath, but, today, she was distracted.

There were so many invalids and sufferers here. She sat on a familiar type of generic chair in a familiar hospital hallway environment. It could have been in any First World city, except that this city was in a reality thousands of miles and dozens of worlds distant from there. How had this place survived the multiverse? How had they forged a civilization here, surrounded on all sides by nightmare? These were questions she wanted to ask herself, but she instead stood and wandered to a window in a nearby doorway.

An old man lay on a bed within, watching a high-set television with a pained and resigned look on his face. Men like himmen who could not defend themselves, men who could not play the game, men who might even welcome the endhad done in a pinch. This time, this stress, this urge, though, was too much for a cheat like that. Her legs hurt from riding, her back often twinged fire from long hours spent sitting and bouncing roughly, and literal horrors had pursued and attacked them at random for the last eleven days. None of it bothered her directly. No, her stress flowed past her like warm water, leaving her untouched, and instead pooling in the dark pit that had always been just behind and to the left of her heart.

Her eyes rose to the television in the mans room.

A frowning old nurse suddenly appeared behind the glass, and the blinds descended quickly.

Completely unperturbed by the surprise, and feeling her dark pit fill a little bit more instead, she turned away. She couldnt think about this right now. She couldnt focus on finding that release. It was too dangerous.

*But this might be the last chance youll have.*

She knew that. Stop lecturing her. She didnt want to hurt her squadmates. This world full of human beings was an oasis in the desert. It was her chance to free herself just long enough to get the job done.

Even locked in cycles of urge and thought, her calculating behavior instinctively brought her closer to the door behind which Kendrick and Randy sat talking with a doctor. Halfway through his appointment, Kendrick had asked for Randy specifically, for some reason, and Randy had asked her to go withjust in case. It was a sensible decision.

An older male doctors voice radiated through the doora man who sounded very intelligent and awareand Lian drove a fingernail into her own hand to keep silent and still. And see this x-ray here? Its remarkable. The machines you described seem to have performed incredibly rapid and accurate microsurgery and macrosurgery at the same time.

Randy actually sounded excited. Will I need to use my tools to perform maintenance on his arm and leg?

Im not an engine, Kendrick complained, his voice weak and tired from several hours of tests. You cant tinker with me.

Aww.

Actually, the doctor continued. We have no idea if your tools would even be of any use. This complex biomechanical machinery seems to have been designed to mimic and enhance every single one of his internal tissues, but without any cellular structures. Ive never seen anything like it. Imagine the computers in control of this technology

Now Randy sounded annoyed. Dont even think about it. That place was a nightmare, and it took half of Kendrick faster than you would believe.

Im just saying, even small changes in the laws of physics would allow for computing speeds beyond anything we can understand. That must have been the case where this happened.

Kendrick sighed. Will I be alright? Thats the real question.

The doctor coughed, probably remembering his graces, and then replied with a much more professional tone. The most shocking part of this entire surgery is that your nervous system hasnt been touched. Those are *your* nerves in those biometallic muscles and organic, um, whatever the hell your reactive intelligent bones are made out of.

Kendrick and Randy both reacted simultaneously. *What?*

Judging by the process you told us, it took your hand, ran calculations and designs. Figured some things out. Then it took your arm, your leg and ribs, and built the new limbs around the nerve tissue it took from you before re-attaching it all to your body.

Wow, Randy replied. So theres no risk of it having changed his brain?

Just the opposite. Thats why you could control it immediately. You had nothing to relearn. It custom built the pieces to respond to your existing impulses in exactly the right way. But what it wanted, or why it did this, or even the rest of the surgical processwe can only guess. Its probably good you escaped when you did, but you still need to be sure not to over-exert yourself, or youll basically rip out your own spine.

Silence fell for a moment, and Lian moved away.

The door opened a little after that, and her two squadmates solemnly entered the hallway.

Good news! Randy said half-heartedly. Hes not secretly going to turn on us and kill us all.

Lian nodded, and gave the positive form of smile she had practiced the most. That is good to hear.

Kendrick adjusted his clothes, examined the torn-up portions of his uniform and jacket around his right arm and leg, and sighed. I need new clothes.

*Thats it, your opportunity!*

Surely theyll throw a single uniform on top of the supplies theyre already giving us at the military base, Lian said suddenly.

Kendrick nodded after a moments thought. Yeah. Lets go ask.

Ill do it.

Really? Are you sure? Thats a serious errand, with their bureaucracy. They took hours to talk to us the first time.

Its important. Clothes are not just for show. Lian glanced over at the small flakes of snow falling outside a window at the end of the hallway to emphasize her point. She upped her human act to the next degree, and even dared to touch him. Go back to camp. Get some rest.

Randy touched him, too, on his human arm. Yeah. Come on. Youve done enough for today.

Kendrick sighed, but relented, and the two departed after quick checks that their handheld radios were still working. If theres *any* danger, you just run and radio us, alright? Randy insisted.

Lian nodded, and then finally headed her own way, her pulse racing. This was her chance to quell the darkness growing behind and to the left of her heart.

Outside the hospital, tall buildings towered in the same style as any other human world shed seen. Many of the high windows were broken, and damage still marred the city streets in some areas, but this place had clearly not been subject to the direct forces of the Crushing Fist. Large groups of construction workers toiled at every corner and on every building, restoring life to the city.

And some were watching her. She sensed those eyes upon her, as she always did, but some of them felt different than usual. Some of those gazes were not following her because of the physical shape of her body and face. This unknown might have scared her had she possessed the ability to feel fear. Instead, her dark pit only swelled further, and her hands itched for a prize.

She moved along through the crowds, turned a few corners, and stole a hat with ease. A jacket followed, large enough to cover her own, andjust like thatthe eyes upon her became purely born of innocent lust once more. She adjusted her stance and began walking differently, and smoothly tucked her hair up under her hat.

A few men deviated from the crowds pattern about a block behind her, confirming her instincts.

They did not find her.

She slipped into heavier crowds, and flowed with them into a large supercenter.

The various paralytics shed found along their journey hung by her side in a hidden little pouch shed made for herself. She wandered along what was, by all its mundane details, a typical shopping mall. This was not an ideal hunting ground, but it would have to do. The need to draw out pain in someone grew to an intense drumbeat in her chest.

*How about that one?*

No, she decided. She shouldnt be stupid about it. That teenage boy was surrounded by friends, and young men were the quickest to guess at what she was doing. They understood predation. They lived it, in a less violent but more sexual way. They might assume she was looking to pick one of them upnot too far off the markbut that kind of attention wouldnt do.

This mall would have to produce a good target, though. Most of her felt nothing at all times, but the part of her that felt *too much* emotion cared deeply for her squadmates; the only family shed ever had. They thought shed had a grandfather, but shed just copied that story from Edgar. The squad mattered to her in ways she couldnt process, so she decided they must never know her secret inner torments.

Nobody knew. Her interviews with the psych evaluators during the recruitment process had been harrowing, but shed been approved, so they must not have guessed.

This mall had a bar. That would make things easier. Listening to the phrases and accents in use in the crowd around her, she ditched her hat and adjusted her stance a second time, becoming someone new. The dimmer lighting of the bar washed over Sarah Zhao from Pittsburgh.

*Does this world have a Pittsburgh?*

She wasnt sure that it did. If not, others would assume it was some small town somewhere. Nobody in a bar would care about a beautiful womans hometown.

Sitting at one end of the bar, she sat with a pleasant expression and watched a high-set television. Her prey would come to her. They always did.

Commercials for car repair, lawyers, and sodas danced across the screen. Typical stuff. The military had handled her squad with care and secrecy, including a bevy of believable lies, but that response seemed rational enough. She did want to discover how theyd survived out here, but her personal priority was more important at the moment.

Drink from the gentleman in the corner, the bartender said with a sigh, sliding over a dark brown beer.

Lian took it in hand, and then turned to scan the room. Old men sat drinking alone together and watching television. A couple whispered over a table in the back. Several men stood near the door, talking and laughing. At one table in the middle, alone, an attractive thirty-something male nodded politely at her.

She gave a warm nod and smile back, and then turned to face the television again.

He came over about twenty seconds later. Eager, but not desperate, she knew from experience. He would do quite well.

Hi, Im Ryan.

Nice to meet you, Ryan, she said, turning toward him and shaking his offered hand. Im Sarah.

You sound like youre not from around here, he said.

She didnt change her expression, but her inner hunter frowned with annoyance at her own inability to pull off the accents shed copied from the crowd. Im from Pittsburgh.

Oh, makes sense, he lied, not caring about her hometown. What brings you to the bar during the day like this?

What brings *you* to the bar during the day? she asked, teasing him.

He groaned. Just got out of court, and they upped my child support again. My damn ex-wife

Lian let her expression fall to match her actual attitude. Hed failed to play the game for even a few minutes. There was no way this fool would satisfy what she needed. Are you kidding me right now?

He looked dumbfounded for a moment. I just He sat taller. No, youre right. Im talking to a beautiful woman at a bar. Excuse my blunder, and let me rephrase. Im asking if youre free right now.

Her smile was nearly genuine. He might do after all. Of course, he had no idea he was steering himself toward being murdered rather than getting laid, but the sensations of the game were the same. Nice recovery. And yes, Im free.

He donned a slow grin.

Hers matched his, but for a very different reason.

She continued their banter, her thoughts on judging the best time to slip things into his drink. The first compound was innocuous, and typically benign. It was only when combined with the second compound, often given laterusually back at someones hotel roomthat a man might find himself having trouble moving. That was when the real fun would begin.

He made a decently funny joke.

Thats just like Molly Ringwald in that one movie! she teased, mimicking conversations from her squadmates. In fact, thats exactly like it She realized, as she trailed off, that he must have seen that movie. And that meant

Ryan gulped and looked down for a moment.

The bartender stopped mid-clean, a dirty glass in hand.

The old men at the end of the bar looked over at her once, twice, and then at each othera third time, at her, this time staring.

The couple in the back shrank in their booth.

The men talking near the door began conferring with one another and glancing over.

It all happened in the span of two or three secondsand then everyone resumed their previous behavior. Anyone else might have missed it.

Lian Yen did not miss it. The military had handled her squad with care and distance, keeping them watched and confined to specific areas mostly devoid of people. She had slipped away from that control and entered the population at large, assuming the careful veils of informational denial were purely sensible military decisions. At that moment, the gravity of her error became apparent.

*Theyre* **all** *in on it.*

She kept her practiced smile up while her mental gears turned rapidly. What should she do?

*Get out! Just get out!*

But drawing attention to herself that way would mean the loss of her rapidly fading social protections. People were talking to one another and thinking. She didnt know exactly what blunder she had made, but these ordinary people would put the facts together and move to act soon. That small time would be reduced to nothing if she gave away awareness of her blunder and tried to flee.

She took her suitors drink and downed the second half. You wanna go back to your place?

Ryan froze again, this time visibly weighing his options. She knew that her own nonchalance probably had him confused about her blunder. Perhaps thered been a mistake? Perhaps everything was fine? And he probably really needed this, really needed the touch of a beautiful woman Sure, he whispered, his voice cracking. He sat taller. Yes.

Good, lets go.

He dropped some cash on the bar, accepted her arm, and they walked out of the bar together.

Silent commotion and a swarm of furtive motion erupted in the bar behind them as they began walking away through the mall.

Sarah, he whispered, keeping a smile up and his eyes on passing stores. I dont know who or what you are, but I appreciate you talking to me today. You made me feel better, and I really needed that. He kept his mouth as still as he could, likely to avoid looking like he was talking at all. *Theyre going to kill you.*

Electricity and ice ran along her skin. She clutched his arm tighter as they walked, thinking. She had her radio, but warning her squad would only put them in danger. Theyd been allowed to stay briefly, and even been given supplies. Whatever conspiracy that was happening hereone that involved every single person, even old daydrinkers in barsher squad was safe as long as they moved on as soon as they could.

The murmuring moved through the mall like waves and wind on the ocean. All eyes darted toward her, and then away from her.

*It really is* **everybody.**

She agreed, and the ice on her skin dove inward to stab at her heart. Was this fear? Was this one of the emotions shed been missing her whole life? It did not feel good.

*Theyre going to kill you.*

Her entire existence depended upon blending in. With all gazes following her, she had no defense. She had no control. If she didnt have control, her fate was not her own. If this man thought they were going to kill her, he was probably right. It was nice talking to you, Ryan. For what its worth, I hope your ex-wife burns in hell.

He laughed. Me too, honey. He loosened his arm, understanding the implication of her goodbye.

She took off running toward a side hallway, and burst through those grey doors to momentary solitude just as dozens of screams and shouts erupted in the open spaces behind. Her flight had confirmed what everyone had feared, and the hunt would now be on. 

Bursting forth from a side door into chill open air and light snow, she ran down a rubble-filled alleyway. If she could only ascertain the truth of this world, then she might have a chance. She now knew her blunder was openly realizing that these people were connected to the First World empire somehow. Whatever that connection was, every single person here seemed to be in on the effort to keep it secret, and they were willing to kill her to do soor, at least, report her to someone that would.

Even as she ran through the crowd, phones began buzzing all around her with emergency tones that startled their owners. People looked around in confusion, until faces gradually started turning toward her. Some screamed. Some shouted. Some ran after her.

A high screen atop an intersection had its feed interrupted. In its place, her face appeared, surrounded by warning text.

*Right! Go right!*

She agreed, and she stole another hat from a street vendor before ducking through an open store. Pushing through and out the back door, she lowered her new wide brim, ditched her outer jacket, and began walking perpendicular to her previous path, her stance implying middle age.

A surge of men in police-like uniforms pushed down the street, and she walked straight through their ongoing cloud of movement without incident. If she could just get back to the squad, they could leave, and everything would be just

A woman screamed.

It was her boots that had given her away. They were military issue, and shed gotten too used to them in the last eleven days. Shed completely forgotten shed had them on.

*How often do you really look at someones shoes?*

She bit her lip and ran as the policemen surged back toward her with guns drawn. Her heart thumped in her chest in a way she hadnt felt since her first killeight years old, and suddenly free, through violence. Death had always walked with her, and now it was her turn. Shed sought freedom once more by joining up with the Vanguard, but, she supposed, that small part of her that felt too much had really just wanted someone or something to end the cycle of urges, pain, and torture.

Turning down another alley, she pulled out her second poison. Shed already drunk the first in the remains of Ryans beer. She hastily dashed an excess dose onto her tongue and swallowed it. There was no telling what these people would do to her, and her squadher surprise familyhad each quietly promised each other to take death as their fate if needed, in order to avoid worse.

It began acting quickly. This was her last chance to use the radio. Would the squad stay and look for her if she didnt come back? No, the mission was too important. She couldnt warn them, or theyd be in danger, too.

She dropped the radio.

*Why are you doing that? Call them! They might be able to save you!*

No.

*You cant let this happen!*

She could.

*Stop it! Nothing else matters but survival!*

She was done listening. She lunged at the first policeman, purposely hitting him where it would hurt terribly, but not impede his ability to fight. He dropped his gun and swung a fist.

Her cheek exploded in pain, but she kept fighting.

Two more men joined the fistfight almost immediately, and another punch sent stars through her vision. A kick to the stomach took one man out, but the other two pummeled her. It was over in just a few more angry strikes.
	
She fell to the ground.

A crowd of uniformed men stood above her, staring down at her limp form and open eyes.

We just punched her, one commented, aghast.

Head injury can do that, another said, leaning down to check her pulse. Finding nothing, he stood and gripped his colleagues arm. Look, they were just going to kill her anyway. At least, this way, it was quick.

What do we do?

Shit, I dont even know. Call the coroner. Tell the military shes dead, give them her description. If shes one of those interlopers theyre keeping outside of town, theyll make something up to make sure they go on their way.

And if shes not one of them?

Then weve got a huge problem, dont we?

Their conversation moved out of earshot as the police cordoned off the area. Several minutes later, a medical vehicle came to pick her up, and she lay in the back, trapped in her own pain-filled body. Was this what her victims had always felt? Shed expected the dose to kill her, but it seemed she was just fully paralyzed instead. No, wait. She'd only taken half a dose of the first compound!

And they were bringing her to a morgue. She railed against her unmoving body in her thoughts, but none of her limbs responded.

Lay her over there, a white-coated man with a mask on said. Whoever she is, we have to figure out if shes human, and we have to be quick about it.

Firm hands carried her over to a metal operating table and set her down.

Thanks, guys. Wait outside in case we need you.

Really?

If shes not human, we have no idea if she can regenerate or something.

Alright.

Her lungs kept moving, but so slowly and so minimally that it was all she could do to stay alive and conscious. She waited, literally breathless, as the doctor and his assistant did pre-autopsy checks and procedures.

September the thirtieth, the doctor said loud enough to be recorded. Five fifty-one PM. Autopsy on potential extradimensional invader. Twenty-something female Asian, probably Chinese lineage. Appears human, may be a facsimile. Well begin with the brain to determine if shes a dreamstealer or other mentally possessed entity, as the military has put the highest priority on detecting those. Witnesses said she spoke about forbidden topics, and then seemed to realize who we really are, so if shes a dreamstealer, she didnt possess one of our citizens. Her body is from elsewhere. He tested a rotating saw, which whirred loudly and viciously.

*Get up!*

She was trying. Trust her. All she had was some breathand a left pinky. Was the poison fading? If so, it wasnt fading fast enough. It was short acting, but shed taken quite a bit.

You want your usual pop? the assistant asked.

The doctor paused the recording. Yeah, sure.

Alright, be right back. A door swung open somewhere, and Lian listened to the sounds of the assistant fumbling with his change. She tried to will the disappearance of his coins.

Hey, got a nickel?

One of the cops outside sighed. Yeah, hold on. The sounds of pockets being searched reached her ears.

She lifted her left ring finger, her thoughts aflame with alarm.

Thanks.

The sound of a soda falling in a machine followed.

The assistant returned and closed the door behind him. Here you go.

The doctor popped open the drink, took two large gulps, and sighed. Thats the stuff. He put the can down on a nearby table. Ready to get to work?

Lets open her up.

The doctor picked up his saw tool. Can you get that hair off?

Lian raged silently as the assistant creamed up her hair and began shaving it off. That hair was a key strategic resource! But, remembering the doctors words to the police guards, she stopped trying to move. The poison would either wear off in time, or it wouldnt. Moving would only get her shot to make *sure* she was dead.

She lay unmoving as cool clinical air chilled her bare head. This long without blinking, her vision was blurry beyond usefulness, but she was still quite aware of the saw as the doctor brought it down to her forehead.

The first whirring slicing feeling tore away the nerves directly underneath, leaving her with an odd line of numbness just above her left eye. She was lucky her parasympathetic nervous system was in sole control of her lungs, or she might have screamed. As it was, the pure agony simply bounced and echoed inside her mind.

When the whirring changed and the vibrations took on a deeper rumble, she knew the saw had hit bone. It was time to act.

Her left hand found a scalpel, and her scalpel found purchase in the doctors left temple purely through the experience and skill of the murderer wielding it. The saw jumped away and skidded across the floor before safety mechanisms turned it off; the assistant turned around, and his throat met with bloody metal.

Falling to the floor, Lian dragged herself forward weakly with her left arm and leg. The assistant was alive, but unable to scream for help, so his death had to be first priority.

Hed fallen in pain, and now clutched at the scalpel in his throat carefully, trying to understand what had happened to him. He saw her approach and kicked her viciously in the face.

She took that kick, and two more, finally clutching his leg to both avoid kicks and climb her way up his body. Gripping the scalpel, she tore it out, and then stabbed at himfirst through his hands, which he brought up to defend himself, and then through his eye with a lucky shot.

He went limp.

Taking care not to be tricked, she loosed one of his veins. He grasped his neck, but soon expired.

Her forehead was both numb and on fire, and her extremities tingled and burned painfully with the slow passing of the poison. Her bruises from the fights and falls ached something mean, and she felt her awareness shrinking as unconsciousness threatened to take her.

Taking the scalpel, she crawled to the door, and then knocked over a pan.

A policeman entered, gun drawn, and she took out his Achilles tendon with a skilled slice. Unfortunately for her, a second officer followed right behind him, and his painful shot sent blood and gore flying from her arm. Unfortunately for *him*, it was her still-paralyzed arm, and her other found his partners gun and aimed it at the soft flesh underneath his chin. From the floor, she fired, and he fell.

A second shot ended the first mans squirming, and she lay there for a moment, breathing hard. Her ears rang near to deafness, her entire body was bruised, cut, and in pain, andnow she had two guns. There was a chance.

Tears ran down her face, both an automatic reaction to clear her blurred and dusty eyes, and a purposeful one at the mess she was causing. Shed been careful her whole life, and kept things tight and restrained, but this was too much. There was no way she could hide this, and her squad was very likely to find out. Even if she did survive this, she would find herself without a family once more; back to the cold and darkness.

The morgues walls were thick and sturdy, likely to keep in the cold and assist in maintaining a clean environment, and she guessed that no one had heard the shots. Crawling along the icy floor, crying and broken, she pulled her way through endless dim hallways and lonely intersections. Was this a basement? Where were the windows? Just one window would change everything.

*God doesnt listen to people like us.*

No, he doesnt, she agreed. Prayers would be useless. She would have to do this on her own.

Pushing a brighter door slightly open, she saw a hallway filled with military, police, and doctors moving back and forth.

Crawling away desperately, she began feeling a tell-tale tingling in the toes of her right foot. Using that foot, now that it could move somewhat, she pushed around a corner and out of sight of that deadly door. If even a single one of those men or women came back here

The idea came to her as she studied her environs. This area, this ramped pseudo-basement, was built from stone. The area out there had been more conventional. And here, she had access to the buildings inner workings.

Crawling into a utility area and reaching up with a pipe to smash things, she made sure as much disgusting water as possible was flooding the concrete floor, and then crawled back to the morgue area. Certain chemicals could be used to start a fire, she knew, if existence would just give her enough time.

Her right leg started to work more fully, and she pulled herself to her feet and stumbled back toward the front with her chemicals and a stolen bottle and rag. It was just simple chemistry, and then a lighter taken from the assistant

*Dont you know smokingll kill you?*

and she opened that door and threw her makeshift bomb into the busy hallway.

A choir of shouts erupted, and screams followed as individuals caught on fire. Others realized that the fire suppression system was not coming on, and she listened as an evacuation took place.

Waiting as long as she could, she stumbled out into the now-empty hallway and stepped over several still-burning corpses. Flames surged across the walls and ceiling, and she covered her mouth with her shirt as best she could with one working hand, but her many layers of injuries were too much. She stumbled and fell in the heat.

Small hands pulled her up, and she found herself being helped along by a twenty-something blonde girl in a patients gown. You okay? the girl shouted.

Lian nodded, and stumbled along with her until they made it out into the chill evening air and drifting snow. Hordes of people milled around outside in confusion and terror, and bright fire trucks were pulling up even as she and the girl moved past. 

Finding a moments peace around back of one firetruck, Lian fell against the red metal and nearly collapsed. Her movement pulled at a decal of the citys sigil, and the fresh sticker came off, revealing different symbols beneath. In a flash, she understood where she was, and true horror set in like frozen cement in her chest.

Hey, her helper said. Arent you

Lian whirled around, bringing the scalpel out in a quick stab. Tears flowed forth from her eyes for reasons she had lost track ofbut the blonde girl held her wrist safely back. The stab had missed.

Dont worry, I wont tell. The girl squeezed her wrist until the scalpel fell, but the motion was not unkind. Everyone knows about your people. *Everyone.* Theyre that way.

Not understanding, but no longer possessing the will to understand, Lian nodded numbly and staggered off into high unkempt grasses. Behind her, as the fire raged, she realized that the hospital was on the corner of the military base near where theyd been camping. Clawing her way over ditches and barren land, she aimed for what she hoped was safety.

She fought like a wild animal when thick arms closed around her, but it took her a moment to realize it was just Bill Nash. Strangely, that was the person shed most wanted to find safety with, even though their night together had beenon her partan act designed to fit in with the group. Whats goin on, Lian? Jesus Christ, you're bald! He paused. "And you've been shot!"

A high-pitched whine rose in the distance, like an alarm for the entire city, and a great rumbling approached. Family surrounded her, but caring comments and concerns faded in favor of shouts of danger.

Are those *tanks?* Kendrick asked. Were moving out!

Lian, can you ride? Bill asked, holding her tight.

She nodded weakly.

The first artillery fire soared overhead. 

*What are they doing?*

She didnt know. She lacked the focus, through her pain and numbness, to understand why these people were so scared of them that they would actually bring artillery and tanks out to destroy them. Ornoit wasnt them, not anymore.

Riding her bike had become a second instinct after eleven days straight. Bill put her on it, and she clung to the bars, following her squad in a daze as the others screamed and shouted for more speed. The next rift wasnt too far awaypart of Kendricks decision to accept a camp hereand good that it was close. She spared a dizzy look back to see artillery fire exploding around a gigantic amethyst inverted pyramid in the sky.

---
2:12 AM. 10.1.15. Lian doesnt know how to tell the others what she saw. If she explains what she saw, she might have to explain where she was, and what she was doing. They would never forgive her.

The lies are far greater than they know. But how can she tell them that they were all just camped at Amber Two? </TEXT>

Carmen Faulkner tried to glance over surreptitiously, but her helmet exaggerated the motion.

From her left, Mona murmured a message on a direct private channel. Terrains getting rough. Might want to keep focused.

Turning forward with pained acknowledgement, Carmen said nothing. Cheng continued to ride a quarter-mile distant from the squad, taking a lonely parallel path. Hed been quiet beforeat least in publicbut he hadnt said a word since his somber return from the training fields. His retrieved tactical nuclear weapon had successfully destroyed the pursuing living rift, but hed come away with heavy white streaks in his hair and a deepened silent pain. She wasnt sure what was gnawing away at him, but some in the group had speculated that it had something to do with what hed seen back at the place theyd trained, and not what he had seen in the rift. The thought sent chills down her neck. How bad could the situation be back home?

Around her, seventeen other motorcycles seemed to hover motionless while flat brown dirt raced by beneath their rotating wheels. Trails of dust shot up from spinning black tires, floating rapidly back into the distance. Above, the pure blue sky and burning sun held the aspect of a still life painting. She fought the worrying feeling that they werent actually making any progress. As much as she might want it, this wasnt a dream. This was life now. That house, that family, those struggles, that new city that had slowly become homenone of that mattered anymore, no matter how much it kept popping up in her thoughts.

---

9-26-15. 11:08 pm. Weve been out here for a week already. Time is flying, since theres nothing but desolation, but I keep trying to hold on to every moment. Five more weeks like this one, and the children back home will start to die. How can that possibly be fair? We have so much less time than I thought.

I guess thats always true.

Theres only one squad left with us. The others have all parted ways, going off in their chosen directions. Were camped outside the last split now: one rift looks out on more generic rocky terrain, and the otherabout three miles northwest of herethey say goes somewhere rather volcanic. I like the other squads captain, Bouldin. He and Kendrick went to flip for it, but then Bouldin caught the coin and said, No, wait. Screw chance. Luck has been against us from day one. Lets keep it uninvolved in our lives as much as possible. I *choose* the other rift.

Kendrick accepted his words, and so did we. Good words to live by. Chance has been nothing but cruel.

---

She dropped her journal, rolled out of her cramped tent, and slipped further from the rowdy campfire area. Out in the star-lit darkness, Cheng sat on the flat dirt outside of his solitary tent, gazing off into the distance. The white streaks in his hair were visible even by starlight.

She didnt ask what hed seen. Hed already wordlessly refused to answer that question twice. Instead, she just sat down beside him and crossed her legs.

Finally, he spoke. McMinns gone. How can they be alright? he asked, referring to the other squad. That was why there were only eighteen of them: Clint had been sent off on an unknown special mission, and McMinn had been consumed by the living rift while Cheng had been riding to retrieve the bomb.

Carmen touched his forearm. The evil closet She hesitated. As terrifying as that thing had been, it still felt ridiculous to say aloud. got a few people. We just have to carry on. There was nothing we could do.

Closing his eyes, Cheng spoke with a tone of guilty admission. Not true. While McMinn was being pulled into Hell, I was asleep.

Asleep?

He shied away from her touch. I fell from my bike and slept. I couldnt stay awake. There was nothing to be done about the othersbut McMinn is being tortured even now because I failed.

You cant help sleep! You need sleep! Carmen insisted, trying not to think about how her daughters had never wanted to take naps. And besides, McMinn isnt in Hell.

What? Cheng sat up a little straighter.

She took a deep breath before elaborating. The others might not talk about it, but the truth is, Bouldin managed to get a shot off with his handgun.

That assuaged the pain in his voice almost immediately. So McMinns?

Yes. The best shooters among the legion managed to kill all the victims but one. Frey.

Ah, Frey, Cheng whispered. Carmen wasnt sure if hed directly met the woman, but there was nothing to be said either way. Nobody deserved such a fate, but there was nothing they could do about it.

Sharing the silence, they sat under the stars for a while longer.

The next morning, goodbyes were stark and few. The various squads had been splitting off almost constantly, and, although this was the last, most had little left to say. As the first hints of morning grey began tracing the sky, Carmen climbed onto her motorcycle, kicked the stand back, and rode into the jagged purple crack in space that had towered over their camp throughout the night. Behind Kendrick and Randy, but ahead of the others, she kept her eyes forward. Cheng was no longer riding apart, and that was enough to steel her for the trials ahead.

Those trials came sooner than she expected. Very quickly, the annoyingly bumpy landscape looked odd in ways she couldnt quite pin down, but it was only after the morning light reached distant peaks that she understood. Everyone else had been staying focused on the irregular ground, so she was the first to raise a hand and point. Its crystal!

Kendrick ordered a wary stop, and the nine brought their bikes to a halt while all eyes took in the true nature of what they had stumbled upon.

This shouldnt be here, Randy said over the comms.

Mona shook her helmeted head. The Devastation rearranged everything. Weve gotten lucky so far, but

No talk of luck, Kendrick interrupted. So weve hit upon a Gemstone world. We can do this. He brought out his rift compass again. Weve got a few potential exits. Lets employ the formation they taught us. Thisll be a good place for a first real run.

A range of helmets nodded in response, and then each rider went his or her own way.

Heart pounding in her chest, Carmen fanned out with the rest, taking up the rightmost position in the formation. As scary as it was to separate, she tried to reassure herself that everything would be fine. Theyd been taught this wide triangle formation for a reasonscout and avoid, theyd said, over and over.

She kept distancing herself from Bill Nashs yellow-trimmed bike to her left until he was just a blip near the horizon. Reaching that point, she joined in the choir of voices reporting reaching their proper distance.

Alright, Kendrick radioed. Remember, keep your eyes on everything ahead. See something, say something, and then compress and go around it.

The voices of her squadmates were in her ears, but Carmen still felt like she was riding across crystal plains alone. The suns light now sent chaotic glints across a sapphire and ruby valleyhopefully, none of it sentientand she worked her way along what looked like the flattest parts.

The Gemstone Hegemony had been silent since the end of the Crushing Fist, and many speculated the Council knew where those collective species had gone, but she still shuddered as she rode by the crystalline spires where the tiger-eye slave gems had been said to dwell. Nothing moved in those natural towers. Nothing moved anywhere, as far as she could tell.

 She started to relax and enjoy the beauty. It was like riding along the inside of a geode, in many ways.

Position Seven! Randy shouted, one to the left of Bill Nash. Diamond farmer!

Kendrick responded instantly. Left or right?

Rightno, left! Randy reiterated her judgment. Left!

Got it, Bill Nash responded. Carmen?

Got it, she said, veering hard left to race after the yellow-trimmed dot that was even now riding up a sapphire hill in the distance. She could see Bill, and he could see Randy, so all she had to do was trust and follow.

Her wheels found that transparent blue slope quicker than shed expected, and her stomach leapt as she topped the hill. She re-oriented on Billand Randy far ahead of himand gunned it. To her right, ahead of their formation, an enormous clear white jellyfish-like creature floated above carefully cut emerald fields. It was not farming diamond; no, it was *made* of diamond, or at least something like it, and its sparkling piezoelectric tentacles waved in agitation as it noticed the non-crystalline intruders.

It had good reason to fear, she knew. Centuries of tension between the First World empire and the Gemstone Hegemony had resulted from corporate attempts to mine creatures made of diamonds. Those first greedy idiots had never stopped to wonder whether the diamond jellyfishes were sentientor whether they had bigger, smarter, and angrier siblings.

But no method of communication had ever been established. The two types of life were simply too different. Remembering this from the true histories made public after the destruction of the First World, Carmen pushed her speed across the emerald fields harder than she might otherwise have dared. There was no way to tell the diamond farmer that they meant it no harm. There was no choice but to avoid it and hope that it understood.

Racing past well out of range, she nearly caught up to Bill Nash and Randy, and the three of them gave a wide berth to the agitated creature.

Randy sighed with wonder. How do you think they float like that?

Magnets? Bill Nash responded.

Inside her helmet, Carmen narrowed her eyes. Theyd studied this in class, albeit briefly. Cant be, since they can levitate anywhere.

Just ahead of them, Mona cut in. Remember, realities can have their own laws, and those laws are inherent in your matter. Atoms, molecules, and so onand crystalline bodies like theirs are extremely cohesive.

Speaking for the first time that morning, Lian added her thoughts from the opposite and unseen side of the formation. So they would lose their ability to fly eventually?

Edgar and Mona responded at the same time, almost word for word. Yes, it would just take a very long time. Oh, sorry. No, go ahead. Thousands Yeah, thousands of years for decay and replacement

Keep this channel clear! Kendrick barked.

Silence fell, interspersed with small bits of muffled laughter. It would not have been inaccurate to say that the squad was generally sweet on Edgar and Mona.

The humor passed, though, as more emerald farms and diamond farmers came up ahead. Carmen found herself pushed to the right as part of what felt like an accordion; the squad, like birds, veered right, veered left, and raced ahead at top speed to quickly avoid a variety of situations that might have been threats otherwise. A clumped-up squad heading one direction together saw very little and had few options, their pepper-haired sergeant had said, but a spread-out squad saw everything and had every route available. That was the magic of communication and speed.

Crap! Pixley yelled. Amethyst pyramid coming up behind us, sir!

Bouncing painfully over rocky sapphire at speed, Carmen risked a look back.

A gigantic inverted transparent purple pyramid had appeared, and was growing larger in the sky behind them. She held her breath to keep the rising animal panic in her chest from taking over.

Its not ideal, but weve got to veer for the closest rift, Kendrick reasoned quickly. The readings are a bit strange, but theres no choice.

Cutting across wide, flat emerald, the squad compressed its formation and shot for top speed. Holding the throttle down, Carmen gripped her handlebars and tried not to think about the pyramid-shaped shadow catching up to them.

Riding up alongside her, Cheng matched her pace.

She calmed enough to stay focused even as purple-tinted shade blanketed the entire squad.

Randy was the first to shout. It has us dead to rights! Whats it doing?

Faster! Kendrick shouted back. Just go faster!

Theyre not like us, Edgar yelled. You cant assume anything about its behavior!

Were sure as hell not *stopping.*

Hell no, sir!

After me Kendricks words cut off as he raced through a dark grey rift between the bases of two massive crystal spires.

There *was* a moment of adrenaline-fueled terror, but the clinging grey weirdness shifted into unexpected sensations without direct danger. The vibration of riding on metal struck her awareness directly, and she found herself speeding along what seemed to be a metal-coated tunnel. Beneath her wheels, grating rumbled, and strange white lights shone overhead, illuminating passing pipes, massive gears, and brief glimpses into untold distances filled with moving machinery.

Theres a rift dead ahead a few miles, Kendrick murmured, his tone filled with caution and unhappiness.

Does this metal road-thing go toward it? Mona asked.

Yeah.

Randys helmet swung back and forth. Could that have been an artificial rift? Could this whole thing be artificial?

Kendrick had no answer for that. I dont like this at all. Lets keep moving. Dont slow down.

Nobody could disagree. With each new glimpse of the world beyond their chrome path and surrounding pipes and gears, it became clear that nothing normal was out there. No stars, no sun, no earthsomething that looked like the Moon was out among void black, but that celestial orb, too, crawled with machinery.

Void black Its an artificial reality! Carmen radioed. Just like the one holding the Capital Temple!

Thought so, Kendrick muttered. We need to get the hell out of

Ahead, even as he spoke, a long metal arm slid down into the tunnel with them. Its base, originating from somewhere unseen, deftly avoided the pipes and gears whizzing by on either side. Keeping pace with the squad even at nearly fifty miles an hour, the arm opened a hand-like array of pincers, blades, saws, and tubes.

In a movement too quick to follow, it grabbed Kendricks right hand.

Carmen stared for a moment. To his credit, the former farmhand managed to keep his wobbling bike from flying out from under him. Keeping his ride steady with his left hand, he tried to fight the thing off with his right.

Shouts echoed in the radio as the squad began to react, and Carmen rode up as close as she dared to see if she could help.

Dont slow down! Kendrick ordered again, the pain obvious in his voice. Leave me if you have to

No sir! Pixley and Randy both shot back, bringing their bikes dangerously close in order to grapple one-handed with the metal arm.

The two women managed to pull it free, and the arm slid back out of sight in a blur of motion. They both slid back a bit, giving him space.

Kendrick kept his head low, his left hand guiding his bike. He breathed heavily, not bothering to turn off his radio. After several seconds, Carmen noticed what had happened.

The sleeve of his jacket did not end at a stump, but his hand whipped in the passing wind like an empty glove. How? How was that even possible? *The machine had taken the inner contents of his hand and left the skin.*

Go Kendrick gasped, his bike wobbling slightly. Keep going

In the position to help, Carmen locked speeds with him and held out her right hand, keeping his bike steady with hers. Jesus Almighty, why did it do that?

She couldnt see his face for his helmet, but he just shook his head. Doesnt matter. We just have to get out of here, in case

But his fear had already come true. The arm sliced back into the tunnel, faster than before, and pulled wildly at his right arm in a blur of cutting and sawing motions.

Holding his bike up, Carmen couldnt see exactly what was going on, but she did see the others pull out their guns and try to aim them without slowing down. It was a dangerous affair, trying to aim guns while moving fifty miles an hour in a tunnel filled with incomprehensible machinery. She waved them off, and Kendrick agreed with a pained grunt even as the horrific claw departed again.

The handling of his bike grew worse, and Carmen dared to move right up against it, practically locking her machine to his.

Slumping over further, Kendrick let go of his handlebars and gripped his side. His entire right arm had been removed, leaving only sliced up skin and jacket to flap violently in the wind.

A small bit of grey light came into view aheadthe exit rift! Trying not to think about the horror of what had just happened, Carmen desperately held her friend and leader up. Almost there, she said, not sure if he could still hear her. The squad was shouting behind her in confusion and anger, but she couldnt think about anything but refusing to lose even one more person. Thered been too much of that.

The artificial rift came fully in sight, and she manipulated what she could reach of Kendricks limbs to speed up both of their bikes. What was it, thirty seconds away? Twenty? They just needed to

Multiple arms blurred into the tunnel at speeds too high to comprehend. Each attacked a different part of the unconscious mans right side, employing all manner of cutting and impacts. She even thought she saw blips of laser use involved, each aimed at his torso.  She screamed at the machinery to go away, but it ignored herand, moments from the escape rift, tears escaped her eyes as Kendrick woke up to scream in agony. Most of the damage had been dealt too quickly to see, but she watched as several of his right ribs were pulled up and away. Was that a taunt? A trophy? She watched those curved bones get pulled quietly away into the universe of gearsand then the clinging grey surrounded her once again.

She brought the two bikes to a slow and mournful halt on grey dirt. Effulgent green fog surrounded her and her slumped friend, casting everything in strange shades that were at once bright and dark. The shadows were sharper, the colors were all jade, and she knew their leader was dead.

The others caught up and circled to a halt, looking on with dismay and confusion.

What the hell *was* that? Randy demanded, her voice a mix of sadness and anger. Why did it do that? *What did it want?*

Next to her, Pixley removed her helmet and shook her head.

Bill Nash looked on in disgust. That was messed up, man.

The others remained silent out of respect.

Carefully, Carmen lifted the unconscious man from his bike. Strangely, he was heavier than before. Wouldnt losing so much muscle and bone make him lighter? Laying him on the ground in the eerie bright-dark green, she steeled her stomach against the nausea and kneeled to examine the missing half of his body.

It was still there.

His jacket and loose undershirt had been mauled, and his skin looked scarred from complex surgery, but his chest cavity, shoulder, arm, and hand were filled out. Functional, even. She watched as his right hand curled slowly.

What happened? he groaned, stirring. My He gasped and sat up, feeling his rib cage, clearly remembering it being torn out by rapid unwanted surgery.

The hell? Bill Nash said, stepping back in fear.

Something strange had happened. That much she understood. The others recoiled, but Carmen stayed. Kendrick?

He looked around, confused, until settling his gaze on her. Yeah?

Are you you?

He squeezed his right hand open and shut a few times, testing it. I feel like me.

Mona gulped, and then offered something. It didnt get to his head. Whatever it was trying to do, it might have been interrupted by our escape.

Edgar came a little closer. Hey, friend. Do you remember what I told you when we first met?

Kendrick spat some bloodwhich pooled black under the eerie green lightand then frowned sadly. That we were all gonna die out here.

A distant growl of anger and hunger rolled across the area from somewhere deep in the jade fog, punctuating his sullen words.

Carmen looked up and around at her squad in defiance. Hes him. He has to be. Well get his insides checked out first chance, alright? But hes still alive, and hes still our leader.

Hesitant nods became more enthusiastic as her insistence made them realize that theyd actually managed to save Kendrick from a terrible unknown fate.

After a moment, he stood. Testing out his right leg, he spat blood againless this time. Bastards did something alright. My right side is heavier, arm, ribs, leg and all. He rolled his foot. But only slightly heavier. And it seems to work like normal. And the burning pain is fading.

Thatd be your nerves adjusting to reattachment, Mona said quietly.

Carmen looked to her. Do you have a guess for what happened?

The other woman chose not to elaborate.

---

9-27-15. 8:13 pm. Nothings attacked us out of this horrible glowing green fog, but the sounds out there never let up.

But I think thats less scary than what happened today. I cant escape the image of Kendricks ribs being torn out.

You know, Ive always taken pride in staying fit. I work out. I gave him a run for his money during training, wrestled him down hand-to-hand. Hes stronger now, though. We tested out his limbs. His right arm and leg are definitely stronger, to the point where he can hurt himself along his spine if he uses too much strength. That scares me. Live, die, fate worse than death, surebut being *changed?* Not being myself anymore? That scares me. No one said anything about being changed by the horrors out here.

I dont want to forget my girls. I dont want to lose the love I still hold for them. My minds made upif anything like that comes for me, if anything tries to change my memories, Ill use my gun. Id rather die as myself than live as someone or some *thing* else.

Cheng agrees. He promised me hed take care of it, if it came to that.

All the same, all eyes are on Kendrick. Ill have to defend him, I know this. I was right there next to him. I know it didnt get to his head. It didnt do anything to his brain. I had my hand on him the whole time.

I miss Barcelona. I was a teenager when my family took me to the Olympics. I told Kendrick that lots of those athletes would have killed for the free upgrade he got. He smiled at that, but I dont think anything will truly humor him until he knows for sure there isnt something creeping through him and changing him. My mother used to say: a giant moon rises over lost souls. I never knew what that meant until I saw the look on his face, staring at his own hand when he thought nobody was watching. Its loneliness, even in a crowd, and nobody can help you but the world itself if it so chooses. All you can do is hope.

---

After her turn guarding the little camp from whatever lurked out in that bright green darkness, she slept fitfully.

The next few realities appeared relatively normal. Seeing their own food rations near depleted, the squad stopped only to survey in grim silence. Bill Nash shot a deer, tested it with a kit full of different liquids in droppers that would change colors in the presence of known poisons, and then showed them how to prepare and wrap the meat. In this, Kendrick helped with small comments, but his manner was more reserved and worried than usual.

Each person had a similar small testing kit to Bills, but they didnt dare split up and search for food until it was absolutely necessary. The deer meat would last for a small while.

It was water that was the killer. Carmen up-ended her canteen on a dusty stop in a burned-out forest, hoping to tap one more drop down into her mouth, but nothing slipped out. Scanning the charred remains of trees all around, she sighed. There were a great many Earth-like planets out there, but most were untamed wilderness. That was the point of their entire expedition: the human race didnt have time to go someplace new and start farming for three hundred and fifty billion people.

Thing is, the Councils analysts and scientists had said that civilization was an inevitability, not a rarity. All sentient life progressed forward over time into societies and structure. That was simply what intelligence sought: mastery of the natural world, tools extended and improved endlessly. Somewhere out in endless shifting realities, full of armageddons and apocalypses and horrible fates, there had to be some good worlds, too. That, or a place where the laws of reality were different in just the right ways to save people. *Youll know it when you see it*, the white-haired and wizened old woman had said at the end of her speech, given near the end of the recruitment process.

Carmen wasnt sure which success she should hope for. There *were* other multi-reality civilizations out there, like the Hegemony, but there was no guarantee they were friendly. But say they found a reality where the laws of physics were such that people simply didnt need to eat to survive. How might something like that change the human race over time? She shivered unhappily.

There was a third option, too, one whispered of between training soldiers in hushed tones: the real goal was to find an anomalous location or artifact that might hold the necessary use or power. Something had duplicated that one guy over two thousand times, she knew, but whatever it was had been destroyed during the Crushing Fist. If they could find something else like that, something that could duplicate foodthat would change everything.

Distracted by thoughts of water and food, she didnt see them until they were all around her.

They moved silently. Their white robes, darkened by foot travel, swished back and forth without noise. These were a people that valued solemnity and spirituality. She remained tense, though, for she had also heard how wild-eyed and fanatical they could be if their Prelates deemed a jihad necessary. From under dirt-stained hoods, grim yellow faces took note of her presence, but none stopped their ritual hand motions to speak to her.

Very respectfully, she walked her bike back a bit, meeting with the others of her squad that had gathered together against the tide of Yngtak mourners. Valley-wide, they moved among the ashen trees, walking on to places unknown. Some might have called it a pilgrimagea long journey to someplace new now that their home was gonebut Carmen had the distinct sense these people did not expect to find a home. As one, the tide of yellow faces and white hoods prayed, but those that fell unmoving were not helped to their feet.

How many are there? Pixley whispered.

Beside her, Randy just shook her head and fought a quiver in her chin.

Lian Yen, standing behind them, filled in the thought. Our people are going to be like that, soon.

A much larger Yngtak male in flowing gold robes noticed them, and turned to approach. A knot of his followers kept him surrounded. His hairless brows arched as he studied the squad. It was clear, from the decisions going on behind his eyes, that he would have preferred not to entreat with them because of past enmities. We have water. Do you have food? We seek a trade.

Several of the team began to speak, but Carmen subtly indicated the lead to Kendrick.

The younger man fought physical discomfort to stand taller despite his thirst. No.

To their credit, the others made no facial expression that might give away the lie. But why lie? Carmen hoped

The Prelate sighed and turned away.

Kendrick gave a silent order with a tilt of his head, and the squad began walking their bikes opposite the flow of robed mourners. It took nearly two hours to emerge from the tail end of the sea of pilgrims, but, when they finally did, he ordered them onto their bikes.

No words were exchanged. This was a moment of truth, Carmen guessed, for Kendricks continued ability to lead. Why had he refused the trade?

The river was only three hills beyond the end of the Yngtak pilgrimage, and protected from the natural fires that had charred the earlier forest. Kendrick held a hand up to keep them back, and brought out his small testing kit. Little dabs into the water on his hand showed no danger, and he carefully put his kit awaythen dove in face-first, gulping thirstily.

The others rushed forward and drank their fill. Carmen dunked her canteen into the icy waters and watched with a soft smile. Kendricks hunch made sense. If the starving Yngtaks had water, then they had to have found it recently, and their path was straight. She looked across a small inlet to where Cheng sat quietly. He nodded, giving her support in her support of Kendrick.

She almost broke down, then, but she held strong for the memory of her daughtersand all the daughters still alive back home. Things were going to be fine, at least for today. For today, the pain and horrors would wait.

Pixley tried to splash people, but she only managed to engage Randy and Bill Nash in a freezing water fight for a few moments before Lian ended it with a devastating tidal strike that somehow soaked all three from ten feet away in one swift motion. The Chinese girl smiled fiercely, daring further challenge.

Alright, Kendrick said, staggering to his feet. Lets get a move on.

---

9-29-15. 12:52 am. They didnt take our arms or equipment. Very confused about the nature of this place. We came across a reality filled with humans. Theres even a city here, though it looks pretty beat-up from some recent trouble.

Were setting up camp on the outskirts of a small military base, with their blessings.

Kendricks getting looked at by doctors. I dont trust them, but we have no choice. Why are humans out here? I didnt *really* think the First World empire encompassed the entirety of all humans everywhere, but these people will tell us nothing about who they are or how they got here. I *saw* recognition, however brief and hidden, when I said the words *the Crushing Fist.* These people are so far out into the unknown lands. How do they know about that, especially when weve never heard of *them?*

I keep thinking about the odometer on my bike. We set it to zero at the outset, and its at 3,226 miles now. Ten days. Has it really been a week and a half already? We arent averaging the twenty miles an hour Kendrick hopes for, but the distance is still mind-boggling compared to what I remember. There were so many empty plains, forests, and valleys interspersed with moments of terror and danger. *Those* I remember.

So these people, these human beings with cities, are over three thousand miles away by landacross quite a number of realities, to bootand theyve somehow heard of the Crushing Fist. What are they hiding?

Carmen Faulkner put away her journal and rolled onto her side in her one-person tent. There was no wind outside, but the night was surprisingly chilly nevertheless. She fell asleep while watching flakes of snow melt upon her tent.

Later, her journal entry would prove to be only the third out of the entire Vanguard expeditionin all their varied directions and dangersto question the truth of the situation at large. </TEXT>

Cheng pushed his speed a little further than should have been acceptable. Riding alone through the night and shooting ahead of the main legion to help set up a trap should have brought out at least a small sum of fear in his heart.

Still curving back and forth around monolithic trees and gaining significant air from every small hillock, he directed his bike with one hand and unfastened his helmet with the other. Slipping it off and locking it to the side of his bike, he rode unprotected in the chill night air. It held the sting of late fall come too early in the season, but perhaps that was simply the way of the weather here in this brooding ancient forest. He even closed his eyes for a moment, enjoying the bite that hinted at freedom, but his animal hands still directed his course and kept him from smashing headlong into the veritable walls of wood whipping by all around.

There was no fear, he realized. Not even alone, at night, in a forest in which humans had never tread. Not even at breakneck speeds, helmet-less, and blind. Hed volunteered for this most dangerous of missions for reasons he hadnt been able to voice to himself, and now he knew: hed been seeking fear. Hed been seeking vitality, terror, and anything of that human being inside him that now stared out of his quiet eyes with no hunger whatsoever.

He might have laughed at the thought of his old teacher in Hanoi. An odd one, he had beenpacifist, Buddhist, and a mish mash of other randomly mixed alternative beliefs that made others roll their eyesbut now the student had found what the master had sought all his life. Cheng felt within himself no wants, no desires, and no pain. This was the pure state that the Buddhist masters sought, was it not? This was supposed to be enlightenmentbut the search to escape it, to feel something again, had consumed him.

Perhaps the cost of such enlightenment had been too high.

He curved roughly and brought his bike to a halt in a wide mossy clearing. The legion might pass this way at top speed, and the trap would have to be ready. Rooting around in his survival bag, he pulled out a small hand axe and began hacking at brush by the light of a single headlamp. The darkness did not bother him. There would be more than enough light soon.

The undergrowth was crackly and dry, lending itself well to the building of a wide ring of kindling around the clearing. It didnt have to be thick; their enemy could not run and jump, as far as anyone could guess. It just had to generate the firelight the strange animated door seemed to abhor. Elsewhere in the vast forest, individuals from other squads were setting up similar traps. There was no way to know which squads the door might follow, so every path had to be covered.

Just as he finished placing his wide swaths of kindling, he heard a growing roar in the distance. It was faint at first, but soon grew into awe-inspiring thunder. He stepped back behind a tree as ten squads rolled through, a tidal wave of sound and motion. He saw members of his own squad, and then remembered his radio. Pulling the detachable device from his bike, he confirmed his trap was ready.

Good, came Kendrick Merrills voice. Was worried something happened to you out there.

Cheng paused. It hadnt occurred to him that others might be worried about him. Some part of him had thought that such a thing had passed from existence with the rest of the Yao family. Motivated to action, he brought out his tinder and lit a particularly dry branch, holding it over the curved lines of kindling he had doused liberally with several donated allotments of kerosene.

And there it was, quite suddenly, with no motion or sound.

Somebody barked an order over the radio, and the squads circled about in the clearing.

Cheng touched his improvised torch down, and fire leapt up ahead of him. Darting to the side, he touched the other lines of kindling. In moments, angry flames surrounded the mossy clearing, illuminating dozens of helmeted bikers and a very out of place closet door.

Immediately, a groan swelled out, drowning the roar of the assembled engines. It was as if the earth beneath them all had suddenly grown angry. The white-painted door blinked from spot to spot within a very small radius, apparently coming up short against the dancing firelight surrounding it.

But no injury was coming to it. Seized by an idea, Cheng rushed forward with his torch and a tin of kerosene. His radio crackled to life, shouting for him to stop and stay back, but he ignored it. As he came close, the door faced him. It did not move; it simply suddenly *was* facing him. He slung the tin left to right, throwing kerosene upon that white-painted wood.

The brass handle began to turn.

His thrown torch was too slow. Something clicked, and the door flung open. The torch sailed into and beyond that vast maw rather than setting the door alight. Later, Chengs journal entry would read:

---

From my vantage point, I was the only one that could see inside. The others saw only effulgent purple lightthe rear of that ingress to Diyu itself. From where I stood, a nightmarish maze lay beyond, of which I saw far more than my eyes should have taken in. A many-tiered landscape ran before me for distances beyond comprehension; Earths and Moons and blood stars floated among these planes of torture. Human beings lay scattered within, screaming for a release that would never come.

But it would be wrong to say that there were planets, or land, or ground. Of these, none were comprised of earth or water or mire. They were *organs*. This was no subterranean hellscape, as I had heard in the legends. This was a *beast*, swimming through the oceans of the multiverse, itself a reality. Somehow, through that open door, I could feel its ire. It wasnt hungry: it simply hated me. It wanted to pull me in and cause me pain for all time. It would only, finally, at long last let me die once nothing of the human I was remained. It told me all this in a deafening grinning groan, and I now have streaks of white in my hair to attest to my understanding of that message.

---

For a long moment, Cheng stood stunned by that hellish blast and noise. Thenthe flow reversed. A growing whirlpool of air began to pull inwards rather than blast outwards.

---

I would have been lost to the numbing blast of that Beasts mental onslaught had I not had a secret advantage: I was already numb. Nothing of the man I had been remained, already. The part of me that had been frozen by that gift of absolute eternal terror was not the part that now operated my body each day.

---

Turning and running away in an instant, Cheng escaped the initial grip of that inhaling vortex. Furthermore, he saw the chaos in the other squadsfor the moment, safely ensconced *behind* the galeand his training kicked in. He lifted his radio as he dashed over mossy rock and grasses. Its a living rift! Processing the fact that the sight had been down a glimmering tunnel, he also realized: And it still has inter-reality dust within. That is how it can change its appearance to look like a closet door!

Where does it go? a random squad leader asked.

*Hell* Cheng said this last word as he leapt toward the firelines he had set.

Of course it does! someone else added, a hint of panic present in their tone.

Kendrick broke in. Keep it together, people. I dont like the wind its generating. Lets ride out and hope it loses us because of the fires.

That was the only plan the fearful soldiers could mount. The long stream of men and women curled around and rode out at top speed, hoping to achieve as much distance as possible while the fires still burned.

Listening to radio chatter reporting that the door had followed them, and intel on what it was, Cheng reached his own bike and took off after the others without donning his helmet. As he pulled out of the clearing, the trees had begun shaking violently in that evil galethe door faced him as he went, continually turning. He understood, then, that it was going to try to put out the fires with the force of the breath it usually used to inhale victims. Time was much shorter than those ahead of him suspected.

When the attack came, it was from an unexpected angle. As he slowed to turn between two lichen-covered boulders, a helmeted figure stepped out from the woods and pushed him over. By dim indirect lamplight, Cheng struggled with his unknown attacker, getting a good punch to the mans gutfor it was a man, by his strength, and by the furious energy behind his movements. The unknown man was either very angry or very desperate. Cheng pushed away and staggered further into darkness after a left hook sent stars across his vision.

Now he regretted his foolishness in not wearing his helmet, but, still, no fear welled up around his heart. Calmly, emptily, he put up his fists and faced his assailant. There was no opportunity for further fighting, however. Both men turned and looked as that angry groan swelled around them. The door had found them.

They both ran as the handle began to turn, but the other man was not running from the door. Instead, he tackled Cheng, who found himself being pushed toward the opening door. 

It became clear to him that his attackers motive was probably important. Furiously grappling one arm down, Cheng used a free hand to pull the mans helmet off. His shock almost cost him his advantage. Clint?!

By the hellish light from the raging rift, Clints eyes were wild. *It wont stop!*

Their struggle drifted toward the door itself, where Cheng braced his back against the frame itself and bit and kicked with all his might against the terrified man and that vicious vacuum gale.

Help came from the side, where strong hands pulled them both away. What the hell are you doing? Kendrick shouted as he dragged them both away.

The door turned to face them, and its whine and pull grew stronger.

It wont stop! Clint screamed, trying to fight them both off. Itll take onejust oneand itll leave! Its the only way!

Sensing that something deeper than that was wrong, Cheng punched the hysterical man in the cheek once. Itll leave, you say. *For how long?*

Studying their interaction, Kendrick pushed them both forward. Get your bikes and go. We have to get out of here. He gave Clint a kick in the back as the wiry smaller man ran. You fucking coward. I knew there was something up with you.

Lifting his motorcycle and donning his helmet, Cheng took off. His heart thumped in his chest, but, stillhe felt nothing but intent and anger. These were simply events, and simple responses had been made. Beside him, a headlamp beam grew stronger as Kendrick caught up on his own bike, but Clints light was nowhere to be seen. A signal indicated a switch in radio channels.

Clint, Kendrick said over the comm. It followed *you* here, didnt it?

No response came.

Theyll kill you when they find out what you tried to do to Cheng, Kendrick said after a moment, deadly serious. Im ordering you to head off on your own. I dont care where you go. Just get far away from us, or I might do it myself. And while youre still in radio range, youre going to tell me everything you know.

Clints sorrow and terror were evident in his reply. It came He gave two sobs. It came to my town in the middle days of the Crushing Fist. There were threats everywhere outside, so we couldnt leave. It took one personand then vanished.

Cheng cut in. Then what?

Six hours later, it came back. 

It was already obvious which dark avenues the mans tale were headed toward.

It just kept getting stronger and more destructive the longer it went without a sacrifice, Clint choked out. As a community, we had to decide. And we did decide. Four times a day.

Christ, Kendrick muttered.

We started with nearly seven hundred people. Order reigned for a while, then chaos, then a new far more violent order. Gangs formed to force their enemies as sacrifices. I just tried to keep my family safe through it all.

Nobody with surviving families had been allowed to join the expedition. That much was obvious. For the first time in months, something vile did touch Chengs heart. The thought of his own family Tell us you didnt. At the end, when no one else was left, tell us you didnt!

No response followed. Whether it was out of shame, or crossing out of radio range, neither man knew.

After several minutes of silence, Kendrick finally spoke. Tell nobody about this. I sent Clint off on a special mission, thats all. We cant have the truth of this hit us so early. Morale would never recover. People would start suspecting each other, rather than trusting.

Understood. Cheng felt his heart harden again as that brief disgust passed. The mission was far more important than any individual drama. In obscure and difficult to feel ways, he did trust his squad, and Carmen the most. She was his own age, and, together, they were the oldest two in the group. She held the haunting pain of a mother who had lost her daughters, and, in terms of lost family, they had an unspoken bond. Still, even that connection was strongest in his sense memories of her warm skin and drunken smile. Emotions were still somewhere out of his reach.

Hed been betrayed and almost sucked into a terrifying hell, too, and couldnt really seem to care.

Kendrick said one last thing on their private channel: At least the door will follow Clint, and not us. We have to get far away from here.

*Before it gets him*, Cheng thought, mentally finishing the sentence.

They finally caught up to the other squads only to find a widely devastated area where the monolithic trees had been torn down and smashed across scree slopes that had been scraped clean by tremendous winds.

The door had not followed Clint. It had gone ahead to those less knowledgeable about it.

The squads were in disarray, and heated arguments passed back and forth over the main channel. Kendrick joined the chaos, repeating his information until the panic calmed. Nowwho did it take?

Despite his numbness, Cheng felt oddly relieved that the woman who had been sucked into the living rift had not been from his squad. Was it inhuman to think such a thing so coldly? He couldnt dwell on it. The door would be back in six hours.

The squad leaders met and discussed the issue. There was no sense in continuing their mission while losing a soldier every six hours. That ghastly entity would hunt them down to zero one by one, and internal friction would tear apart the squads. In this discussion, Clint was not named, and the energy was too tense for anyone to connect his absence to the situation.

The decision was finally made with grim certainty that they would lose one man or woman per six hours that the plan required. Kendrick came over with a pained expression.

Still standing alone with his bikenone of his squad were concerned, for none knew what had happenedCheng listened and nodded. He was the natural choice for this mission, given that he and he alone knew the true back story and extent of the threat.

While the rest of the squads continued ahead on their mission, he turned and went the other way, heading back.

This time, he wore his helmet, for he had to ride as fast as possible. Arcing and flying over the mossy rocks and tangled shrubs, he pushed his speed as high as he daredafter all, every six hours meant one more life, and they were a days ride out. One day there, one day back, eight lives in the balanceunless he could make better time than the much larger legion had.

There was no time for sleep. He stared straight ahead, working his way out of the thinning forest, until he hit the open plains and managed to reach fifty miles per hour in the wide tracts the legion had previously trampled. The sun rose slowly, lighting his way, and he considered using his limited supply of burst speed. After a few minutes of consideration, he realized that the temporary extra speed wouldnt change anything. He would expend his boost capability, not have it later, and save only a small bit of time.

The first six hours elapsed, and he reset his watch with a heaviness weighing on his chest.

His head began feeling fuzzy, but he clenched every muscle in his legs to stay awake. He rolled back through that first rift at top speed just as his watch went off again. A second life had been lost, but he had unmade the previous days travel in only twelve hours. 

Struggling to stay awake, he rode his bike right up to the fields where they had assembled the week before.

A massive array of triage tents had been set up. Scores of wounded and dying were everywhere. Now starkly awake, he stared around in numb horror. How had this happened? The million-strong vanguard had only been sent out a day and a half ago! Some tremendous percentage of them had already hit upon disaster and been cast back in shambles.

He caught sight of his sergeant among the storm of doctors and supply trains. The older man saw him, too, and hurried over. Tell me theyre not all dead!

No, were fine, Cheng said, hoping it was true. We just need a nuclear bomb.

Oh good. The sergeant did a double-take. You what now?

After describing the threat, Cheng laid out the plan. It was fairly simple, really, as most plans involving nuclear weapons probably were.

Sober-faced, the sergeant listened, and then pulled him along toward a supply area across the field. On the way, he stuck close, and whispered low, Keep this to yourself, but guns and machines arent the only thing humanity, in its peculiar kind of madness, over-produced. The second wave of soldiers we send out is going to be armed with the knowledge your expedition producesthat, and something a little stronger.

The sergeant slipped into a heavily guarded area behind high fences, and returned ten minutes later with a non-descript brown briefcase. Its deceptively light, but itll do the job. The controls are here, and the code is on this separate piece of paper. He grinned, then. Good to hear you kids are keeping sensible. Give this gift to that evil door with my regards.

Cheng nodded. His skin tingled with apprehension as he accepted the briefcase. He understood the power of the bomb inside, and it directly prickled his spine to think that the detonation of such a small device could wipe out a square mile or more.

Off you go, boy, the sergeant said, his humor gone. Every minute might be another life.

Sir. Cheng kicked on his engine and rode away, his stomach churning.

---

Now I had a nuclear bomb with me, and that was disturbing enough, but the extent of the wounded and dead already returning home had shaken something deep inside me. The higher-ups had been very clear that only a small handful out of the entire expedition would survive; seeing that process in action was, at a base level, disturbing.

And I was caught up in that process. Every six hours meant another lifebut exhaustion bore down on my head and neck with increasing vehemence. The stiffness approached pure torture. There was no way I would make it back without sleeping, but sleeping meant at least one more person would die. Somewhere outside the thick numbness in my core, anguish struggled with necessity. If I slept, one more would die than absolutely necessary. What if it was Carmen?

I shook constantly, purposely trying to keep myself awake as I rode across the grassy plains. I passed through the first rift again, and set out along the legions path. The greatest enemy here was actually the terrain itself; not out of difficulty, but lack of it. The plains were simply boring, and the monotony drilled into my awareness at every moment.

I did reach the beginnings of the forest. There, the first lumpy hillocks caught me up, and I tumbled horribly and painfully from my bike. The machine itself kept going for a time before toppling over harmlessly, but I could not reach it. Lying in the dirt under those trees, the warm sun dappling the earth, I fell asleep. Part of me was screaming at that, but I had no choice. For a brief few moments, my numbness was gone, and I cried for the life I was wasting by giving in to my bodybut it passed, and I woke with a start somewhere near evening.

Up in an instant, I ran to my bike and continued riding on into the evening and subsequent night. I no longer cared to look at my watch. The news it held could only be terrible.

Morning grey was returning by the time I reached the spot where I had split from the legion. I realized with a pang that I was not nearly done yetthey had headed on for as long as I had ridden. The only saving grace was that their trampled path through the forest was obvious. Eventually, the trees gave way, and I drove out onto open plains once more.

I was again on the verge of passing out from exhaustion when I finally heard the wonderful roar of those scores of engines. Adrenaline lifted my fatigue, and I announced on the radio that I had returned.

Its on our trail! Kendrick shouted to me. Do you have our ace?

I do. I pushed my speed, even using a small bit of my precious boost fuel to catch up. The Sun was rising, and I guessed the door might soon retreat to shadows and lay in wait for us instead of brazenly giving chase. I sighted it blinking quickly after the squads, and I rode up alongside it. Remember me?

It turned to face me as it blinked along, gave a sadistic grinning groan, and followed me as I turned away from the legion. It was important to get away from the others, because there was no telling how the explosion might play out.

And, if I have to admit it to myself, I was ready to die. I had been since the moment I found myself alone among the bodies of my extended family. I was the last of our particular Yaos, and the world wouldnt know or miss me, but I found our dealt hand to be cruel. Existence had given me nothing, so I decided to give it nothing in return. Perhaps that was the source of my numbness.

Im laughing. Why am I laughing? Such exuberance makes it hard to write. Im hiding now in bright sunlight, alone and distant from the rest of the legion. How strange is it that the best place to hide is in an open plain in broad daylight? The door still lurks. This I know. I can hear that groan from a distant copse of trees, or from roving shade cast by particularly thick clouds. It will be time quite soon. And this, my duty, this log entry. Will it be my last? I shall leave it behind with a radio tag and ride on to a great distance. Our sergeant certainly drilled into us how important this information will be. The second wave will find this and learn. Good luck to you all.

---

Kendrick rode in the middle of his seven other remaining squadmates, his heart tense. It was only a matter of time

The light reached them first.

Everyone down!

As one, the legion of squads ground to a halt and jumped to the earth behind any rocks or in any gullies they could find. The blast was not overwhelming, but still fearsome. On the horizon, an eastward spike of flame shot up at an angle into the sky, a lance of pure energy that marked the death of that stalking living rift.

Or, so he hoped, as he hid among the high grasses with his heart hammering painfully between his ribs. If a nuclear bomb didnt destroy the animated door, they were more than screwed. It was clear, from the strange directional focus of the explosion, that the bomb had gone off deep inside it. If that didnt wreck the rift inside, nothing would.

Something did return later that day, but it was not the door.

---

10:36 PM. 9/21/2015. Now certain that we are free of the evil that stalked us. Tomorrow, the legion will begin to split more deeply, and we will head out into the true unknown, where the boys back home can no longer help us. Although the door claimed some over the last two days, spirits are high. The quiet bastard pulled it off. A little scorched, but still riding hard, Cheng survived. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The connection made when Cristina realized she always had the book from orthogonal and didn't randomly pick it up makes me wonder just how far ahead of the story you think of these things. I love how that connection between the beginning of Portal in the Forest and the end of Final Acts exists. So do you pretty much have the entire multiverse mapped out already?

I have more than anyone can guess mapped out in some areas, and much less than you might expect in others. Half the fun is seeing comments and engaging you guys, but the other half is letting the characters get into trouble and (hopefully) get themselves out of it :) For this particular example, I did know where Cristina was just before the Portal in the Forest began, and that she had the book right from the start. In the rest of the series, while so much else gets explained, there's a pretty consistent 'gap' just before tPitF begins for exactly this reason. She doesn't remember, and nobody else knows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Id fallen asleep watching television. My glasses were still on. Movement in those glasses was what first woke meI thought one of my roommates was pulling intermittently at the rim. For several moments, I was aware of it, but not fully awake. As my senses started returning, I thought it was really strange that whoever it was also had their hand on my forehead.

I shot up in terror when it first occurred to me that the sharp little pressure points on my forehead were not human fingers. The first terrible images in my mind were of rats or raccoons, but the thing that fell past my face as I sat up felt too small and light. I stared at the floor by the dim light of the television, but the changing shadows seemed messy and chaotic. Where the hell had it gone? Thered been something the size of a *hand* on my head, and it had fallen forward onto our wooden floor but all I saw was a small weird distortion.

Pulling my glasses off and examining them, I realized that something had *taken a bite out of them.* What the hell?

I leapt up on top of the couch and hurriedly put my glasses back on when I realized that something the size of my hand had crawled on my face while I was asleep and tried to bite meand when it had missed, it had instead bitten right through the frame of my glasses. The missing portion was smooth around the edge rather than jagged, but I didnt know what that meant for the shape of the things jaws.

It was time to call in help, masculinity be damned. Gavin! Tony!

I was surprised that Tony came running; he was usually gaming with headphones on and completely oblivious. This time, though, he was down the stairs in a flash. What is it, man?

Theres something *in here*, I shouted. Something big, and crawly. It bit my glasses.

He looked at the mangled frame around my eyes. Something did that with a bite?

Yes! And its somewhere on the floor.

He leapt back onto the first step and stared at the gloom-shadowed floor. The movement spooked something to my right, and I saw a blur skitter forward.

Tony slammed his foot down, crushing it.

You got it! I came down from the couch, amazed.

But he wasnt relieved. He tensed up completely and remained unmoving. Hey he whispered, pained. Get Gavin.

I frownedand then noticed the widening dark pool underneath his foot.

I pulled out my phone and called Gavin while trying to turn the lights on. The switch did nothing.

In fact, many of our lights were out. I finally helped Tony sit on the couch and bandaged up his foot as best I could with a moderately clean sock. Upon my third call, our other roommate, Gavin, finally answered.

Whats up?

Are you home? I asked him quickly.

Yeah, Im just getting some work done. Can you guys keep it down?

Gavin was pre-med, and sometimes a snob, but the situation was too dire to get annoyed. Can you come down here? Tonys bleeding badly.

What, really? Okay.

A few seconds later, I heard his footsteps upstairs, and then he came down rapidly with materials in hand. He took stock of the situation, stepped around the pool of blood, and approached with a medical eye. He removed the bloody sock. Turn on the lights.

I cant. They wont come on.

The hells going on down here? he asked with a frown. Whatever, use the light on your phone.

Right. Holding up my phone, I lit Tonys foot.

By that strong illumination, he studied the damage. Jagged bits of bloody material poked out and *through* Tonys foot. With practiced precision, Gavin slowly extracted the pieces one by one before stitching wounds and wrapping salvaged areas. You really need to get health insurance.

I dont have that kind of money, Tony complained, his face strained and bright red against the pain. What is that stuff? What jabbed me?

Gavin pulled the last and largest piece out. He wiped the blood away and held it up to the light. Looks like glass. Did you stomp on a cup or something?

Tony just looked at me, confused. Wed both seen something dart across the floor. There was no way it had just been a rolling drinking glass, right? Or had we just been confused by the low light conditions?

The only glass in the room was a big beer stein still on the table to my right. Id had some beer earlier, but it was empty now, and certainly not broken. In fact

I saw the skittering motion and acted before the thought even registered in my brain. I brought the giant beer stein to the floor, upside-down.

Id caught it.

Gavin tightened the bandage on Tonys foot, and then turned around. He froze as he saw what Id done. What *is* that?

I shined my light on it. There was no mistaking that it was some sort of horrible spider, and the mere sight made me shudder. It was as big as Id imagined; about the size of a fist. It was oddly hard to see, but I chalked that up to it cowering away from my phones light.

Grabbing a thick paper from our coffee table, Gavin slid it under the beer stein and lifted the whole thing. Carrying it far from his body out of fear and disgust, he moved past the couch and plopped the entire trap on the kitchen table. He leaned over it, studying the strange spider within. Get some light for Christs sake!

I ran down into the basement and checked the breakers, but they were all on. Charging back upstairs, I shined my light at the ceiling in the living room. The bulbs were gone.

Tony, are you seeing this?

Holding his bandaged foot tightly and grimacing, he looked up. Whered the lights go?

I frowned. Id had a bit too much beer earlier, but I was still starting to sense certain connections.

Guys! Gavin called. Come look at this!

I helped Tony stagger over.

By the light of his phone, he illuminated the fist-sized spider from behind. I thought it looked weirdits *transparent.*

Up close to the trap, we stared.

As we watched, a small glimmer appeared inside the spiders midsection.

Something going on in its cephalothorax, Gavin whispered.

The glimmer turned into a glow, and then what looked like a small circular candle flame. I had the distinct impression that the transparent spiders stomach was a tiny furnace.

My smooth-edged glasses were still distracting in my sight. There was that, and the missing light bulbs, and the fact that the spider had crawled on my face to pull at my glasses. Guys I think this spider eats glass.

Gavin frowned. Dont be ridiculous.

Tony limped further into the kitchen while I pointed out what Id seen.

As Gavin and I argued, the glow from the spider reached white-hot. We both stopped and stared as it leapt against the inside of the glass beer steinand melted its way right through. We both screamed and leapt back as it charged out.

Returning at that moment, Tony brought down a metal frying pan, crushing it.

The sound of pressurized shattering glass boomed through my ears. Spikes of pain shot up my arm, and I screamed once before shining my phone light on a series of small clear shards sticking from my skin. Trembling and pulling them out in a cautious panic, I said what I was thinking: They dont just eat glass. Theyre *made* of glass!

Gavin shook his head. No way. Spiders made of glass? Thats impossible.

You saw it making heat in its stomach! I protested, picking out the last couple spikes from my arm. It melted its way out. It melted my glasses! And the light bulbs are all gone.

Tony lifted his metal pan defensively. Do you think there are more?

How did they get in? I asked aloud, treading carefully toward the front of the house. Our parking was out back, so we almost never used the front door, but that didnt mean something else couldnt have. My light ran across the mostly-wooden door, finding nothing out of the ordinary, but the front windows

The front windows are gone!

It was a hot, still night, and we hadnt noticed the missing glass. How could we have? The panes were already clear! But that meant the glass spider or spiders had crawled in, at most, a few hours before.

Tony said what I was thinking. Lets get the hell out of here. This is messed up.

Gavin shook his head. We have to catch one. Trust me. Its a big deal. Well get famous.

Easy for you to say, I complained. You havent gotten sliced or jabbed.

Do *you* want to pay for the missing windows? he asked. I bet theyre eating Tonys gaming monitor even now.

No! Tony shouted, limping for the stairs. I dont have money for another one!

Angry that Gavin had so obviously manipulated him, I grabbed a frying pan from the kitchen and ran after Tony. Wait!

But he didnt wait. By the time I reached the top of the stairs, he was nowhere to be seen or heard. I flicked the light switch.

Nothing happened.

Creeping forward, my pan at the ready, I tried to listen for that tell-tale clinking glass skitter. I heard some movement somewhere around me, but they could have been in any room. I tried to think of all the important objects I owned that were made of, or contained, glass. Should I be rushing to my own room to defend my valuables?

I heard a crunch, and another high-pitched and chaotic little explosion. Tony doubled over in pain as I entered his room. He had his monitor under one arm, and his pan in the other.

Drop it, man, lets just go! I told him, scanning the dark room for blurry motion.

No, he groaned, staggering forward despite little bits of glass leaking blood down his jeans.

Fine! I shouted, too filled with adrenaline to argue effectively. Instead, I kept my pan ready, and my eyes on the floor as we moved back down the hallway. It was dark, but distant streetlights gave us sight by pale lurid orange.

When Tony screamed in terror, I realized that spiders didnt necessarily need to use the floor. Whirling around, I saw three glowing little furnaces moving around the monitor under his arm. Were they pissed off enough to attack him directly, or were they just after the glass? If I swung, theyd fracture, and completely wreck his arm.

But he wasnt thinking about that. He swatted at them.

To his credit, he did get them all. Three for three. Even in the dark, he truly had a gamers hand-eye coordination.

After the initial physical shock of the loud shrapnel bursts faded, I left his monitor on the hallway floor and carried him the rest of the way, fighting tears of sheer horror. By the faintest streetlight orange still reaching us, I could see gobs of his flesh falling from his mangled limb and torso. The metallic stench of blood flooded my senses, and warm stickiness ran down my hands and made it hard to hold him.

Pulling his limp body down the stairs, I shouted for Gavin.

He made no move to come help.

Call an ambulance! I screamed.

He stood at the kitchen table, his phone lighting several wire cages. I recognized them as the cages one of our previous roommates had used for a hamster; theyd been left behind after the move. Yeah, I recognized the cages. I didnt recognize Gavin. Behind his light, his eyes seemed sharp and intent. Well do no such thing.

What? I screamed, pulling Tony toward the couch. Hes seriously hurt!

If we call an ambulance, Gavin reasoned coldly. Well have to tell them what happened. Our discovery will be taken from us, and credit will go elsewhere. No, our one shot at fame and fortune lies in studying these impossible glass spiders.

I clenched my fists. Were gonna die here, you idiot!

Nonsense. Theyre harmless. They only eat glass. He bent down near one of the cagesand I realized that each one held a trapped spider. Jesus! Just how many *were* there? He put his face near furnace-capable pincer jaws, but the glass arachnid within cowered away. See?

I was frustrated, but I had no argument. I didnt know what to say. I couldnt think. Instead, I forced myself to say: Help Tony. Hes going to bleed out.

Gavin approached, stood over the couch with an icy and calculating gaze, and then returned to his pets. I dont have the tools to save him. Hes as good as dead.

Thats why we need to *call an ambulance!*

And I already told you why we cant.

I pulled out my phone.

Gavin suddenly turned and brandished what looked like a leg from one of the bigger spiders. Dont be a fool. We can share in this. Escalating this will just force violence.

Why do you even need money? I screamed at him. Why dont you just *be a doctor?*

He wavered in place, his eyes distant. Do you have any idea how much debt Ive taken on just to go to med school?

After three heartbeats of silence, I understood. You failed out didnt you?

One more heartbeat of silence passed.

He rushed me with a wild look in his eyes. I shined my phone at his face, blinding him, but his stab still struck me in the left shoulder. Falling backwards, I screamed again, hoping some neighbor, *any* neighbor, would hear and call the police.

They never had beforenot even for gunshotsbut I still hoped.

That arachnid leg-dagger came down again, and I turned away on the floor. Slicing pain slashed warm heat straight across my back, and I kicked reflexively. My flailing shoes landed with heavy impact in what felt like his stomach.

Forget it, he rasped. Call an ambulance. There wont be any evidence for you. Staggering to the kitchen table, he stabbed into the cages, smashing all but one spider.

Up on my feet by then, I opened the front door. The humid and still night beyond waited quietly, offering me escape. Except I couldnt leave. It wouldnt help.

I stumbled around the other side of the kitchen table, avoiding Gavin, and grabbed a heavy knife from a drawer. I took up a position at the back door, blocking his access to the cars while I dialed emergency services. Youre not walking away with that spider. I held the knife in one hand while I lifted the phone to my ear. The police need to understand what happened here.

No! Gavin shouted. Wild-eyed, he took the last cage and ran the other way. He had just enough space in the living room to reach full speed as he went out the front door.

The police did have questions. The EMTs had questions, too. I heard later that Tony died on the way to the hospital. By then, I felt nothing but numbness. I guess I purposely didnt speak for a time. I needed to put my story together.

After two hours of pretending to be in shock, I finally told them that the construct in the front door had been an ill-conceived art project. That was a lie, of course, but there was no evidence of the nightmarish arachnids that had invaded our house. I needed a way to make the violence seemed accidental, and it turned out my art major was finally good for something.

There was no need to search for Gavin. Hed failed to think through the entirety of the threat. Our arachnid invaders had been made of glass, certainly, but theyd still been spidersand spiders make webs. Apparently, theyd chosen the unused front door for their main web, and it had been weaved completely out of glass spun finer than razors. Id looked out the front door and seen nothing; it had been almost invisible.

It had turned out to be far stronger than that invisibility belied.

At full speed, Gavin had run right through it and fallen onto the sidewalk in front of the house. Id seen the whole thing, and he hadnt even slowed downwhile running, hed just kind of slid forward, and apart. The cops had shown up to find about three dozen chunks of him splattered onto the cement and grass outside. </TEXT>

Kendrick leapt up in response to fearful shouts.

---

10:12 PM. 9/19/2015. Our first threat, and nobody knows what to make of it. What can only be a closet door has appeared in the dark area between three campfiresours and two others. The door comes complete with a freestanding frame attached to nothing. White paint, white door, common brass handle. A couple dozen men standing watch, guns ready. This is the last thing I expected t 

10:22 PM. 9/19/2015. Possibly hostile closet door sent our camps into a frenzy by emitting a long, deep groaning noise. Edgar says it sounds like it is longing or calling for something. I say its confusing us as preamble to an attack. Im going to suggest all units ride for another half an hour. We cant sleep with this godforsaken thing in our midst, can we?

11:54 PM. 9/19/2015. The door has reappeared despite our campsite move.

I stood with the other squad leaders. We had some choices to make. The first suggestion was that our squads go different ways, but stay close to communicate. We could then see which squad the door was actually following.

That surprised me. Id simply thought all of us were in danger. Someone had the suspicion it was after a specific target, but for reasons unknown. Perhaps hunger, or something else.

I didnt want to split anyone up. I suggested we deal with it as a group while we still had manpower.

After some discussion, the others agreed.

Right now, were putting our trap into motion... will continue log after.

That finally made the smaller man leap up. I wanna take off. I do. I wanna run for it. Who wouldnt? He breathed hard, his eyes reflecting the campfire. But I wont. Goddamnit. I was going to. I was gonna get that bike and just head off into whatever hills, never to be seen again.

You pathetic piece of

Hey now, I said I wasnt going to run.

Kendrick focused his remaining willpower on fighting the boiling rage inside. It wanted an outlet, but this was not the proper target. Why not?

Clint just shook his head and sat back down.

After several heartbeats, Kendrick also sat. A couple minutes of awkward silence passed with nothing but the crackle of the dying fire to stimulate their ears. As time wore on, there was another concern, too; one that made him embarrassed enough to ask. I dont suppose youre?

No, sorry. Clint didnt seem angered by the question, though, unlike most back home might have been. For that, he was relieved.

Together, they sat in silence until the others slowly filtered in one by one and went to sleep in their respective tents. There was no time or emotion spared for bonding or promises. They were all well aware that this was their last night as civilized men and women, and possibly one of their last nights alive.

Sobering up, Kendrick slipped into his tent and lay alone in the dark, all sorts of conflicting heats burning up his cheeks. For as messy and disorganized as humans were, they were startlingly good at collectively making a man feel apart and alone without realizing it.

His journal entry for that night had only two lines: *Gonna murder whatever evils we run into out there. Bare hands.*

He did not come out of his silent boil until the next morning.

*This is not the end of the human species,* their black-eyed leader said, addressing them all one final time. *You are two packs now. Those that remain in the homelands will have their own struggles. If you fail in this mission, it only means the death of this pack. If that is how it must be, we must accept that. Even complete failure and a loss of all lives is still a victory. Those that remain behind in the other pack will eat. They will live with strength and with discipline, because of our absence.*

Had she just said *our* absence? He swallowed a lump and tried to flex the nights chill out of his bones. So this Brekat did have some identity, and did think of herself as part of the pack. That was reassuring for reasons he couldnt quite put together. It was easy to hate the faceless and the nameless. It was quite another thing to hate a family member, no matter how distant the relation.

The great ranks broke, and the squad headed back to their campsite. Geared up, helmeted, and ready to go, Kendrick tested his engine and studied his squadmates. Invisible tendencies reinforced the same pairs from the previous night. Maybe those in command had known, because that now set him apart as squad leader. The position had been fairly obvious from the beginning, but now their drill sergeant stood back and watched them from afar with a tearful salute, and there was no one else.

Kendrick returned the older mans salute. Ill keep em safe.

See that you do, he shouted back over the roaring engines.

He nodded one last time, pulled his visor down, and headed out into the high grasses. Nine men and women followed him, and he marveled at the strange feeling of heading into the unknown. There was literally anything and everything out there, and they were going to simply ride motor bikes out into it.

That, and these people were going to follow *his* lead. He had to play it safe.

Radio check. Roll call.

Edgar here.

Billy Nash, ridin out!

Im here, Randy said, cheerful.

Wygant here.

Faulkner, sir, Carmen said.

Kendrick laughed. Im not your superior, Carmen. Im not even entirely sure the New Exodus vanguard is a military organization. Guess we never had a chance in our three day boot camp to go over that kind of thing. No need for sirs and maams out there, anyway.

Yes, sir, she replied.

Goddamnit.

Pixley, here, *SIR!*

Lian present, sir.

Cheng present, sir.

Im here, Clint said over the comm, rounding out the roll call. He sighed. Sir.

So it had been decided for him by the squad. He, in turn, decided not to fight it.

To their left and right, other squads flitted past the tall bladed stalks. A hundred thousand other ten-man squads were spreading out in a circle, and that circle would soon become a sphere as they each went their different ways. For now, there were a huge number of nearby soldiers riding alongside, and they would be in relatively known lands. It was a good time for an equipment check.

Everyone got their canteens?

Ten *ayes* followed.

Rift compasses?

Ten *ayes* followed.

Everyone got fifty gallons of gas?

Ten *ayes* followed. That much, at least, was unmistakable. A hundred and eighty nine liters of high octane gasoline rode in special bloated compression tanks on either side of the bikes backthree hundred pounds of weight, give or take. As a squad, their collective miles per gallon were going to start out in the shitter, but every gallon of gas burned would be that much less weight to carry. If these bikes got a hundred miles to the gallon fully loaded as they were now, their last few refills would go a very long way. All told, their Brekat commander had challenged them to travel fifteen to twenty thousand miles.

And twenty thousand miles was doable in the time allotted before humanity starved as long as they averaged twenty miles an hour, time for surveying and sleeping included. Fifteen miles an hour at the absolute worst. Anything less than that, and there would be nobody left when they returned.

That was fine, Kendrick told himself. Only about seven times as long as North America from coast to coast. Seven rides across a continent, and through realities insane and unknown, with no civilization, no support, and no backup. He took a deep breath. Remember, guys, out of all hundred thousand scout teams, only one squad needs to succeed.

They heard him and reassured each other, but none had any words to shore up his spirits. The memory of his church choir singing at his mothers funeral all those years ago came to him unbidden. They sounded alarmed, sad, and regretful, and he couldnt say he felt otherwise himself. Fighting off crippling doubt and fear, he let the whine of his squads engines fill his senses.

And that whine was augmented by the drumbeat of human intent. Breaking out into low open grasses, the sight of the true fleet of squads kindled his hope. A great wall of helmet-clad riders extended to the horizon on either side; thousands of squads rolling together into the unknown. As the morning sun rose higher in the sky, whole legions veered away, heading for their own rifts, but the feeling of unified action remained.

The remaining legion naturally shifted into a long line as their target rift approached. Far back from the front, Kendrick kept his eyes peeled for that telltale purple. During the Crushing Fist, the rifts had cleaved apart from each other internally, filled with miring inter-reality dust that had been smashed down into the cracks between worlds, but the transition was usually smooth now that the crisis was over.

And so it was.

---

Our first day out was a strong one. The sun is warm, the land is alive, and spirits are high. Were camped with many other squads who are still on the same path for the moment. Fraternization is nonexistent; nobody is foolish enough to think we are safe. That ended with the first rift we took. I do still have the one bottle of liquor Sarge gave us, but I suppose well save that for return celebrations after weve found food.

Because thats the one thing we dont have. Each of us has a couple days rations, and nothing more. The human worlds had plenty of guns, machines, and gas, but, somehow, with all our technology and achievements, the need for food is still the final word in our affairs.

I wonder how many of the men and women in the squads camped around us are going to die before this mission is through.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The initial numbers were huge, but the statistics, level by level, would have a devastating impact. Of the three hundred and fifty billion human beings that were to partake in the New Exodus, a bitter third had been chosen by random lottery, so none could blame them for refusing to help further. Of the two thirds that had actually volunteered to leave the worlds of humanity, seventy percent were old, sick, or injured, and were not able to contribute beyond simple survival. Among the remaining able-bodied, a full eighty-five percent had volunteered out of hope rather than fatalism, and had thus brought at least one husband, wife, father, mother, son, or daughter. Familial relations beyond one level deep were not considered grounds for disqualification; nevertheless, an additional thirteen percent chose not to apply in order to take care of grandparents, cousins, and step-children, bringing the total exclusion for family bonds to ninety-eight percent. Among the population of able-bodied men and women without strong family ties, the rate of volunteerism for the mission at handtruthfully characterized as suicidal and possibly hopelessonly barely topped three percent.

Of those volunteers, only eleven percent approached even a lowered standard of military fitness; of that group, only forty percent were deemed mentally capable of handling what they would be asked to do. Lastly, another third were expected to wash out of the three-day super-intensive training for various personal reasons.

All in all, the Conglomerate Council expected to be able to deploy only about one million men and women for the first mission to be carried out by the New Exodus vanguard. Despite all training and precautions, survival rates over the coming four-week period were estimated to be somewhere between two and four tenths of a percent. That meant, of those million volunteers, only two to five thousand would eventually return alive.

It was truly impossible to predict how many of those survivors would find a reality with the proper bounty and safety for humanity out in the multiversal wildsbut, despite the devastating statistics, in the end, only one needed to succeed.

A former farmhand with a wide jaw and an intent gaze sat in the back of a moving pickup truck, nursing his constant anger silently among ten other close-packed men. His name was Kendrick, and he mentally repeated those statistics in the voice of the female Commandant that had given their pre-training speech. She had hammered that point into the assembled crowd with fiery eyes and brutal barks: yes, the task was grim, but just one success would be enough. Kendrick was aware of the statistics, but he was still determined to be that one. The fury boiling beneath his heart would accept no other resolution.

His opposite clung to the other edge of the truck bed. This man was everything Kendrick was notuntrained arms unlike his natural strength, soft hands unlike his calloused fingers, longer brown hair unlike his short blonde buzz cut. How had he qualified for this mission? Did he even qualify as a man?

The brunet glanced sidelong with awareness. Edgar.

Taken aback, the stronger man sat a little taller after a particularly heavy bump in the road rearranged their cramped pile of legs. Kendrick. He sensed an unexpected sharpness in that intent gaze, and hed long ago learned to afford men with that kind of sight a certain deep but narrow respect. Whaddya see?

Edgar rolled his face away from the winds of travel to get the hair out of his eyes. Nothing about the motion diminished the contrast between the serious calm in his eyes and the white-knuckled grip he maintained on the edge of the truck. Were all going to die.

Fighting down a sudden boiling surge from his heart to his fists, Kendrick shook his head. Not all of us.

Want me to walk you through it?

Please do.

The multiverse isnt flat, Edgar said, looking up at the sky. Theyre gonna have to send us out in an expanding sphere formation. What it didnt outright destroy, the Devastation rearranged, so we have no idea what the realities out there look like now. The farther we go in a sphere shape, the farther well be from help, and from each other. Were not going to make it a week before were each basically aloneand being alone means well be dead the moment we step into the wrong reality.

Not me, Kendrick shot back, his knuckles white for a very different reason. Im not gonna let that happen. Ill choke everything that crosses me with my bare hands if I have to.

Edgar narrowed his eyes. How are you going to choke a ruby cube?

Those are all gone.

Fine then. How are you going to choke a reality where oxygen doesnt exist? Or where the Sun has gone red giant and swallowed up the Earth?

Kendrick relaxed his fist. Wed have to go mighty far to find a shift in base spectrum that big. Far as well ever reach, the realities are all from the same super old branch. A tree trunk, really.

Edgar, too, relaxed. Smarter than you look, huh?

Maybe. Or I just listen well when people tell me Im gonna die if I dont.

A good strategy. After a nervous exhalation, Edgar freed his hand from its death grip on the side of the truck and held it out. Kendrick shook it with sincerity.

The two men exchanged no other words. Under the circumstances, wishing each other good luck would have seemed like an empty gesture.

The truck finally rolled to a stop just before noon and took up a slot among long rows of other vehicles. Clouds of men erupted from each like disturbed flies from a piece of meat. Too jumpy to stay in place, but too afraid to go very far, they buzzed around until an organized offensive of drill sergeants swatted them into proper lines. The lines were then marched across the vast open plains toward the staging area where the women had already arrived and assembled. Each gender had been evaluated by doctors separately while back in civilization, but such differences, as soldiers, would no longer matter out here.

To that end, the female ranks had all been positioned at intervals. The drill sergeants swiftly dropped the men into those dotted lines, mixing the two indelibly. Kendrick glanced past the short redhead to his left to catch sight of Edgar, but the smaller mans intellect was wholly engaged on some distant concern.

After a few moments of field-wide silence, a fearful shudder ran down the rows.

Kendrick tensed, and the boiling heat under his heart circled in his chest without direction. Everyone knew that those *things* were somehow allies now, but he couldnt bring himself to forget what theyd done. Hed gone into the fight at the Capital Temple with a hundred other friends and neighbors; only two had come back alive, and only one had come back with both arms. Had the statistics of that battle been the same as what they were about to face? He clamped down all his muscles to keep from striking out at the creature as it passed, while Edgar just watched it in fascination.

It was human, by most measures. From many angles, it was simply a startlingly physically fit woman in uniform. An astute observer, like Edgar, might have noticed subtle darkness running along prominent veins. It was only when the creature turned to face the ranks that its most inhuman feature became undeniable. Pure black eyes, without iris or emotion of any kind, evaluated each of the new recruits.

Is that a Brekat? the redhead to Kendricks left whispered.

That was their new name, as given by their allies, but Kendrick made no move to affirm her question. The black-eyed lieutenant immediately fixated on the two of them. His skin crawled with disgust and angerbut that chill gaze soon passed.

Lacking a proper name, or even complete individuality in many cases, the black-eyed soldiers had no name for themselves. *Brekat* was simply something someone had come up with at random, and it had stuck. Whether the black-eyeds liked or disliked it, they had never commented. Their existence was one of battle, hunting, and animal tribalism, yet the soldiers they had once been remained somewhere within. That calculating discipline, above and beyond any other strengths, had made them more fearsome than any animal.

Her voice rang out across the deathly silent field; a chill hiss under the noon sun. *Death is a given. You already have death. That is where you begin. You may only win life through the most brutal of struggles. If you cannot accept that, walk away now.*

Uncomfortable shifting flowed down the lines, but the drill sergeants made no move to stop it. Somewhere far to the right, a large man stepped out.

The black-eyed lieutenant stalked over and stood before the quitter. *All of you must understand. If you choose to walk away, you must fight for that right. Life is earned, not given.*

Despite his best efforts at self-control, Kendrick turned his head to watch. The million-odd men and women behind him and to his left did the same.

The large man held up his fists.

The Brekat woman faced him in a similar stance. Her veins darkened, and her muscles bulged as if trying to bristle animal fur she did not have. Her black eyes did not waver.

His first punch hit empty air, and she slid up underneath him and brought his entire bulk to the ground with an audible impact.

She stood over him, but faced the onlookers. *Fight me and die without worth. Fight out there and die so that others may live. A simple choice.*

The would-be quitter remained on the ground, groaning, as she returned to the front.

*For three days, you will train with the necessary equipment. You will train in foraging, surveying, and hand-to-hand combat. You will have exactly eight hours sleep each night. There will be no deviation from this schedule. As of an hour ago, all food supplies for the three hundred and fifty billion humans engaged in the New Exodus have been exhausted.*

Murmurs ran through the soldiers.

*Three days is all that can be afforded for your training. It will not be enough, but it is more than nothing. Each day you spend here is a day that every member of your vast tribe is not eating. In three days, they will be hungry. In three weeks, they will start to die. As it is with nature, the weak will perish first. Children, the old, the injured. In six weeks, few will remain. In eight, none will.* She paused. *That is assuming they lack the will to begin eating each other.*

For a moment, the rage within Kendrick was quiet. The chill of those shadow-laden words slid ice around his heart. To his left, he saw a tear run down the short redheads right cheek. Beyond her, Edgar nodded absently, his expression deadly serious. He had clearly already been considering that timeline.

She had one more word for the assembled listeners: *Go.*

The sergeants began corralling groups into squads, and Kendrick found himself pulled along toward a distant corner of the fields. Five times, the stream of men and women were split into tenths, until he and nine others reached a certain privacy away from the endless mass of squads that had scattered from horizon to horizon among the high untrampled grasses.

A grizzled veteran with a peppered beard and dark hair eyed down his ten recruits. Behind his uniform, he was older, but still strong. Over his shoulder, a strap led down to a tremendous backpack. Roll call. He looked to each of them in turn.

Kendricks acquaintance was first. Edgar Brace.

Sir, the older man shot back.

Edgar Brace, sir!

Good. Now you.

Mona Wygant, sir!

Bill Nash, sir.

Kendrick tensed as hard eyes fell on him. Kendrick Merrill, sir!

Carmen Faulkner, sir!

C.J., sir, said a wiry brown-haired young man with a grim look about him.

C.J.? Im not calling you that. Whats it stand for?

Clint.

Youre no Clint Eastwood, son.

Who?

Nevermind. Clint it is. Next?

Jennifer Pixley! The tall blonde hesitated. Um, sir! 

Cheng Yao, sir.

Lian Yen. Sir.

Last was the short redhead that had stood to his left at the initial inspection. She was small, but her loud voice belied her size. Randy Ellwood, sir!

The sergeant frowned. I thought I had six men. Your names Randy?

Yes yes sir. She gulped, and tried to stand taller.

Alright, whatever. He slung his pack down and began throwing a leather-bound journal to each of them. First up. Learning to make entries.

Edgar meekly raised a hand.

The sergeant glared. I know you know how to write. Im talkin *entries.* Youll have radios, but you *will* be out of contact at times. Command estimates well learn most of your stories by finding your log on or nearby your corpse. Grim shit, I know, but we gotta have that intel. He sighed. Other thing, we have no idea whats out there. When you go into other realities, youre still you.  Your body, your gear, your molecules and what not. Theyll still have our He trailed off, searching for the word.

Mona, a bookish dark-skinned brunette with shoulder-length hair and a demeanor serious enough to match Edgars, spoke up without hesitation. Our laws of physics, sir?

Yeah, he replied, raising one eyebrow. But everything you eat, everything you breathe, everything you touch, will take a bit of those molecules and replace them with new ones. Now we dont know what the hell youre going to find out there, so you have to write down every single thing you see, every single thing you feel, and every single thing you do. The log will be your first sign of trouble, and the last way to get that info back to us when we follow in your footsteps. He took a few steps around the group, evaluating each. A reality where everything is on fire, or a reality with blood oceansthatll be easy to spot through the rifts. No, its the ones that affect your mind thatll be the hardest to spot. Use the journal. The journal is life.

Kendrick turned the leather-bound half-inch thick book in his calloused hands. Hed expected violence and pain, but *writing?*

And it wouldnt leave him alone. After every training exercise that day, the sergeant ordered another journal entry. While exhausted, while beat up, while tired, he was expected to make an entry detailing what had just happened. Practice surveying for water? Make an entry. Practice using a chip compass to locate natural rifts between realities? Make an entry. Visit the outhouse? Make an entry. 

He was sitting apart from the squads crackling campfire, journal open, pen in hand, when a single flake of snow landed with a barely perceptible wetness at the upper base of his thumb. It melted in an instant, but it had fallen directly where hed already been looking, and the spirit of hated journal entries had overtaken him just moments prior.

*10:12 PM. 9/16/2015. Snow flake fell on upper base of thumb.*

He looked up at the night sky.

*No clouds. Unseasonably early in the year for a snow flake, now that I think about it. May report this crisis to the sergeant.*

His annoyance at having to write temporarily quelled by his sarcastic act of rebellion, he closed his journal, clambered up onto exhausted legs, and went to see about his squadmates. He had no idea that, out of all the copious logs that the New Exodus would produce, he had just penned the first record of snow.

Closer to the fire, the rest of his squadmates sat in somber exhaustion, tins full of water in hand.

Carmen, a burly olive-skinned woman in her thirties whose strength had surprised him earlier in hand-to-hand training, offered her opinion to something that had just been said before his arrival. Its a good movie. Thats all there is to it.

Kendrick joined the circle around the fire, his expression woeful. Still talkin about Molly Ringwald?

Edgar paused his water tin just before his mouth. Its only natural people will discuss common points of reference. You dont find it odd that the career of one specific actress is the same in all our realities? All the same movies and shows with different dialogue and different actorsexcept for her?

He frowned. All our Earths were grown from the First World reality, right?

Yeah, but that was nearly a thousand years ago. Edgar lowered his tin without taking a drink. Even the Amber Worlds, cut off for centuries, had an actress named Molly Ringwald star in the same movies and shows over the last thirty years. How is that possible?

Mona spoke up. Planets are huge and complex systems. We were bound to find similarities somewhere. Why this one fact rather than another? Its random.

Cheng, a quiet fellow from one of the Asian countries Kendrick couldnt tell apart, just watched and listened in confusion. He had never seen any of her movies.

Beside him, Clint, or C.J., chose to remain wary and silent. Kendrick watched him for a moment, subtly put off by him for the third time that day.

Lian, a lovely Chinese girl with a hidden vicious streak, wondered aloud whether anyone had any pictures of said actress.

Carmen raised a finger. Thats a good point. What if its not even the same person, just the same name? Maybe someone from the First World made up the name because it sounds nice for an actress. That could be how it got to all our worlds.

I *like* Molly Ringwald, Pixley stated defiantly, offering support against an attack that had not been made.

Randy, the redheaded girl with a boys name, screwed up her face. This chick isnt even here and shes still stealing my thunder.

Bill Nash, a fellow buzzed-cut former farmhand, returned from an outhouse trip just in time to offer his two cents. He zipped up the fly of his fatigues and said, You know shes not a natural redhead, right?

The circle erupted into a chaos of unheard points and shouted arguments.

The sergeant slammed down his water. Christ, end it! Bad enough I had to put up with this crap from the other trainers.

They all fell silent.

Go to sleep. Youve got seven hours til wakeup call.

Fueled by irritation, Kendrick was the first to stand, and the first to get his cramped one-man tent set up. It was little more than a triangular coffin of fabric, but it could be turned inside out to match either green and brown foliage or tan and grey barrens. He wondered if a time would come when he would rather sleep outside of it to keep watch for horrors unknown.

His head had hardly hit his small lumpy pillow when daylight hit and the sergeant woke him up with a shout. The older man flipped through his journal. Not good enough. Not detailed enough. The journal is life, Kendrick Merrill! You will write these entries until they are a step-by-step guide to your every goddamn thought and action down to each individual fart!

He groaned and pulled his way out of the tent under full assault by shouted orders to shape up.

He then made log entries detailing those shouts to shape up.

After stalking over to their new training area, he calmed down, his torture forgotten. He even smiled.

Ten glorious machines awaited the astonished eyes of his squadmates. They were either large dirt bikes or small motorcycles; not at all the hogs of professional bikers, but, rather, lightweight bikes similar to ones he had used to off-road with his father and brothers back when theyd still beenhe caught himself before the rage boiled up around his heart again.

The sergeant gleamed almost as brightly as the shinier parts of the bikes. Check out the backbone of your mission. One-twenty-five cee-cee engine, fifty miles per hour top speed, and a hundred miles to the gallon at full load.

Whoops and shouts filled the air, echoing nearby squads, but Randy was the first to dive toward one and examine it with almost manic eyes. A hundred miles to the gallon, even weighted down?

Thats what I said.

She pulled a few small tools out from somewhere within her clothes. 

Kendrick followed the rest of his squadmates forward. Each eagerly picked the bike color and design that suited them best. The red-trimmed one fell to him as if by destiny, and he accepted the implicit promise of blood that came with it. Hed never mentioned his burning desire for vengeant violence to the military psychologists. They didnt know.

He paused, his hands on sleek red and chrome. Was it possible that others had done the same and lied to the psychological evaluators? He glanced covertly at Clint.

The grim-faced smaller man already sat atop his grey-trimmed bike, his fingers trembling on the handlebars as if he was eager to take off and make a break for it.

First World tech for sure, Randy exclaimed, dropping part of a casing on the ground. 

Pixley stood above her, examining the exposed machinery. Is that a secondary injection assembly?

Yeah, Randy replied, eyes alight. From the label here, its not nitrous oxide, but something like it. Turbo speed if we need it. Very limited uses, though.

Kendrick turned away from their conversation. So, Pixley only *seemed* like a ditz. It was safe to assume anyone that had been vetted this far into the process had far more capability than they might otherwise let on. His eyes fell on Edgar atop his blue bike. His first acquaintance had his eyes on the horizon. There was no telling what was on his mind.

Hey, put that back on! the sergeant barked. This hogs your life, as much as your journal. Dont damage it.

Panicking, Randy screwed the casing back on, stood tall, and saluted.

The sergeant grumbled, and then turned to the rest of them. Todays our first ride. He pulled out a traditional compass. Lets see gotta avoid a hundred thousand other squads ok, that way. Helmets on. Radios are built in. Youve also got a backup handheld radio that can detach.

Kendrick waited a moment, red helmet in hand. There were always newbies.

Randy and Pixley held their own. Clint sat in place on his bike. The rest circled awkwardly, testing out their machines. A few minutes advice got them set up right, and Kendrick thanked his lucky stars the bikes werent any larger or heavier. If any of them really needed to, they could simply use their feet to stay up.

After that, they were off. At speed, handling the bikes became much easier. Kendrick took the lead behind the sergeant and Randy, helping to trample high grass for the others behind. They werent even breaking twenty miles an hour, but that wasnt really an option on this terrain. At times, he looked back at Clint, but the jumpy man always returned his helmet-clad gaze with steady fierceness.

Whatever, Kendrick decided. If the guy was going to make a run for it, so be it. The thrill of riding immediately bonded the squad in imperceptible ways, and the roar of the engines faded behind the ongoing radio chatter. In the lead, the sergeant stayed silent, letting them talk.

They rode through the fields, up into distant hills, and finally along rough terrain between high ancient trees. Here, the sergeant had them practice the squad formation and tactics that, just like their journal and bike, would keep them alive. He had them run through it over fifty times, hammering home what they were supposed to do, and

Back at camp, Kendrick shouted at the sky in rage as he worked his way through detailing all fifty formation runs. There were many he couldnt specifically remember at first, but the sergeant stood above him, shouting over and over.

Eventually, somehow, amazinglydisturbinglyhe found he indeed had details in his head of all fifty runs.

Just needed enough motivation, the sergeant shouted. Now drop and give me fiftypushups!

Kendrick groaned and got down in the dirt.

While he was sweating, grunting, and pushing himself up and down to counting barks, he stared at two white flakes among the crushed grasses.

Those two flakes remained on his mind while he collapsed near the fire that night, but he had no words or energy to process the image further. The rest of his squad lay strewn about nearby, equally exhausted by the days ride and subsequent physical training theyd each been subjected to in sequence.

The ten of them lay immobile around the campfire, staring up at the crazily speckled night sky. In this reality, out on the edge of the once-protected lands, there were no city lights. There were, in fact, no cities.

With only one day of training left, the reality of what they were about to do was sinking in despite no prior mention of what was on everyones minds.

My grandfather died early on during the Crushing Fist, Edgar volunteered out of nowhere.

Carmen sobbed. My girls. It took my girls.

The campfire popped for a few moments.

Chengs voice rose up among the smoke. My family was wiped out.

Kendrick turned his head in the grass, but then went back to looking straight up. He wasnt ready.

Mine, too, Lian said. Though it was just my grandfather and I.

I was engaged to be married, Pixley added, her tone giving no need for elaboration.

Randys voice trembled. Yeah, what of it, guys? Were all here because we have nothing and nobody. Thats our demographic. Thats who we are.

Shut up, Pixley countered, sniffling. If I wanna bond with you, I will.

Fine.

Silence fell again, heavier this time.

The words fell out of his mouth before he even realized what he was doing. Im just glad my ma wasnt around to suffer any of this. My pa, and my brothersthey died in the Fight. They never even saw the last days of the Crushing Fist.

Jesus, Edgar breathed from somewhere near his right arm. And our chief instructor is a Brekat

Yeah. Kendricks pulse raced dangerously in every corner of his body, but he felt somehow better for having gotten his fury out. And now theyre our allies, so I cant even have my revenge.

Bill Nash grumbled angry agreement somewhere near his left arm. Take it out on whatever bastards we come across in the shit.

I plan to. He hesitated. No. We were a farming family. If Im the one that finds the food, thatll be enough for me.

You mean *we*, Mona said. Were going to find the food together.

No more words were said that night. Exhaustion and introspection reigned.

Later, crawling to his cramped tent, Kendrick realized Clint had never shared like the rest. There was going to be trouble with that man, he guessed. One day left to figure out his story before it became a danger to the squad.

He awoke to the sergeant standing above his tent, open journal in hand.

He braced for a shout.

Good work, the sergeant said, dropping his journal back into his tent. Compared to what you came here with, youre a goddamned Rhodes Scholar after only two days.

A what?

Damnit! the sergeant stomped off. Nevermind.

The third and final day of training started off with a bangliterally. Kendrick staggered over to the gun range, fighting his tired legs. Even compared to farm work, the constant running, riding, fighting, and surveying had been tiring. Now, bodily and mentally exhausted, they were supposed to learn how to shoot guns? He already knew how to shoot rifles, but these were handguns, delivered by the truckload.

Out in the high grasses and aiming at nearby hay bales, Edgar lifted his protective ear gear. Elsewhere, a hundred thousand random shots echoed across the plains.

Whats up, Brace? Kendrick asked, noting his expression.

Are you familiar with the Thompson doctrine?

I mean, some of it. Which part?

Guns dont help, Edgar said quietly. Cristina Thompson saved and destroyed whole planets without a single firearm.

Kendrick looked around, watching the rest of his squadmates practice their aim. Would one day of training really be useful for anything? Not that this was a vicious offensive, but still. Whats your point?

These guns, Edgar said, practically whispering. Theyre not for enemies. Theyre for *us.*

Kendrick felt a distant note of doom, as if a bell tower somewhere was ringing for their squad. Us?

Fates worse than death. Think about itfriend.

And, indeed, as the others practiced their aim, Kendrick could not deny the truth. Guns were only useful against other peopleor oneself. Lets hope it doesnt come to that. It was all he could say, even as he realized that those in command had the capability to be less than truthful to the men and women they were sending out into the untamed multiverse. This misdirection had been intended to keep morale up in a very important fashion, but what else might they have deemed necessary to lie about?

He kept his concerns to himself, but still wrote them in his journal.

The second half of the day came with a sudden cessation of all training. It was time to rest and recover according to the sergeant, and learning to do that was as important as any other tactic. Relieved, but also growing increasingly tense the closer the time for departure came, the ten squadmates pushed their various small tents close together and talked to one another from spaces protected from roving insects.

No more mosquito bites, Edgar groaned. Seriously, Christ.

Bill Nash laughed. Youll get used to em.

Sporadic chatter marked the afternoon, but most were tired to their core in every muscle and neuron, and respite was a numbing drug that kept them quiet until evening.

It was only when they all crawled out of their tents that they saw the final shipment. Someone had delivered a pallet about a mile away, and the sergeant had personally carried four very important bottles back to the squad. Gazing into the twilit distance, the older man grinned at them. This might just be the biggest party of all time. A million of us, ladies and gentlemen, drinking on our last night together. He handed out two bottles of fine liquor. Two for you all, one for me. He laughed. And one for the whole squad when you hit the road.

Bill grinned. You think two bottles of liquor is gonna get *all of us* drunk?

Dont get drunk, private. You dont want a hangover tomorrow. The sergeant sat at the far end of the fire, his bottle in hand. Just drink enough to make bad decisions. Think of it as your last team bonding exercise.

Mona held back a laugh, which involuntarily turned into a snort. Edgar burned bright red, even by the light of the fire. Evidently, the smartest two of the group had noticed the equal balance of men and womenand nobody had missed the fact that the million soldiers on the training fields were all decently good-looking. The sick, the unfit, the old, and the infirm had all been statistically culled away from this group.

His heart suddenly thumping in his chest, Kendrick fought a wash of feelings he hadnt had to face since grade school. A farmers life was hardly a social one, but he was no fool. He already instinctively knew what was what and who was who, and he could feel Pixleys stare on the side of his head. His thoughts churned alongside his stomach as he tried to figure a way out of his unexpected duties.

Talk loosened with each round of shots, and the conversations delved into serious explorations of past decisions and their new-found feeling of family.

Breaking his three-day streak alternating taciturn silence and feigned outrage, the sergeant finally spoke from his heart. Yeah, I got a girl back home. Earth Fifty-two. She was one of Alek Staleys people, and brought in comatose. After the alliance, the shadow that ate er came round and gave her somethin back. Woke up at the hospital I was stationed to guard. He smiled wistfully. Girl was ravenous for life after being out so long, if you get what Im saying. Groans rounded the campfire circle. Just sayin Shes got one black eye for all time, too, so if we ever get in a fight, well, Ive got one free hit before I get in trouble with the law. 

The men laughed. Several tufts of grass thrown by the women hit the Sarge in the face. I kid, I kid! He added his liquor to the rounds, and the three bottles began approaching empty. Seemingly out of nowhere, dancing took up existence around the campfire.

Hotfaced, Kendrick artfully tried to avoid Pixley as she swayed toward where he was sitting, but his very different kind of dance grew more difficult as his squadmates began to disappear. Surprisingly, Cheng and Carmen were the first to vanish into the high grass, and then only Kendrick noticed when Edgar and Mona were suddenly no longer present. Bill Nash and Lian went off to check out some flimsy excuse and never came back. Only Clint, Pixley, and Randy remained, and the other man was lost in his own brooding thoughts by the fire. Desperately, Kendrick tried to keep up an interesting conversation between himself and the drunk blonde and redhead.

Pixley had him cornered, arm tight around his shoulder as she laughed about something that had been said, and he was fearing that there was really no other way to tell heruntil Randy sobered up for a moment, noticed his distress, and gave him a knowing nod. If the engine isnt working like it should, some of the parts must be the wrong fit, she said, leading the drunk blonde off into the high grasses.

He sighed with relief and slumped by the fire.

Clint had come out of his brooding long enough to watch his final interactions. Its not a big deal on my Earth.

So the odd man out had finally chosen to speak. He sat taller. It isnt?

No. You can do whatever you want, or be whoever you are.

Kendrick relaxed somewhat. Sounds like a nice place.

It was. Clint turned his gaze back to the fire and seemed about to shut down again.

Glancing at the passed-out sergeant, Kendrick prompted his opposite while nobody was around to spook him. So whats your story, C.J.?

Same as everyone else. Just running from demons, Merrill.

They were on a last-name basis, were they? Well thenwait, what was Clints last name? More than a little drunk, Kendrick got up on his feet. You know were only as strong as our weakest animal. So says the Baket.

The Brekat?

Yeah, that. Those black-eyed bastards.

Clint did not stand. Youre drunk. Go sleep it off.

His face burned red with anger rather than embarrassment. I came here to fight. Did you?

	<TITLE> The Hungry Invader </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-03 00:01:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Id been aware of the chill in the air for quite some time, but Id never expected such a brutal omen. Id stopped pulling the tiller just moments before, and had stood still to recover my strength for a moment. My limbs were weak from working the fields all day, and I was actually about to thank the cold for keeping me from overheating when the first flake fell.

Snow.

It was snowing. 

We were supposed to have had another two months, and barely enough time for another growing season. I hadnt even planted this round yet, and it was already snowing. My digestive system tightened as if consciously anticipating the approaching hunger. I dropped my farming equipment and ran for home.

A narrow spike of trees separated our field from a view of home, and I darted between them with a sense of confused pain. The trees still had all their leaves. How was this happening? Was God punishing us for something? I stopped at the small creek that marked the halfway point through the trees. Something was amiss.

The quiet burbling sounds of the brook mixed with the song of shifting leaves overhead. I should have been surrounded by the solitude of nature - but, instead, I felt accompanied. My gaze fell on the thick wall of bushes and undergrowth that marked the beginning of deeper woods. Stalks gently waved in the chill breeze flowing between the trees, and I stared between them, slowly zooming my sight in closer and closer.

Something large jumped up and scrambled away.

I responded in kind, running as fast as I could out from among the trees.

Dancing curtains of snow greeted me as I rushed out into the open air. I wasnt sure what Id seen, not exactly, but it had certainly been nothing native. Reaching the small hillocks we called home, I ducked into my dugout.

The neighboring farmers were already there, discussing the snow.

What do we do?

We were depending upon another harvest!

Well have to cut rations again. We can survive this.

Not all of us.

Dont talk like that, fool. None of us will survive if we dont stay unified.

I looked to each of them in turn, my skin colored by exertion and fear. They each took notice in turn, growing silent one by one. Once all eyes were on me, I spoke. Theres something out there

Something other than snow? our eldest neighbor asked, taking my agitation seriously.

Trying to calm down and explain myself, I elaborated. It had four limbs, and ran on two. Its hide was ragged, flappy dirty. We locked eyes for a second. That thing was *not* just an animal.

The other farmers seemed skeptical, but the eldest seemed perturbed. We have to deal with the snow crisis, but take someone and make some rounds. Check the fences, and such.

I knew when to hold back. I wanted to shout that fences would do no good against an intelligent creature that could obviously climb over things, but Id gotten *some* traction. Taking my closest neighbor, who was also a decent friend, I headed back out into the snow.

Whipping white whorled around us, dampening visibility, but we did our best to check all the fences around our habitats. We found nothing - until we came to the wide hillock that served as our collective storehouse. The lock had been broken, and the door slammed open and shut in the wind as we approached.

Was that *thing* inside? Cautiously, my neighbor and I crept underground.

Long rows and shelves of cured meats, carefully packaged vegetables, and other foodstuffs sat within. These stores were all we had to survive the coming winter, and something had broken in. I moved down one of the aisles to the left, and my neighbor took one on the right. I crept along, listening and watching, but no threat lurked within.

We took stock, eventually finding that only one small bit was missing from each type of food.

We didnt lose much, my neighbor said as we moved back out into the chilly blizzard. At least thats good.

I wasnt so sure we were safe. Examining the door-post, I found a small design that had been made out of jagged scratches. It marked the food stores.

Why?

No idea. I gazed out into streaming white, trying to guess at the creatures intentions.

We didnt know what it wanted, but the break-in was enough proof to convince the others that something was truly out there. A few of us hastily built defenses around the food stores, and we stood watch that night as the snow began sticking instead of melting.

It was my shift just around dawn. The snow hadnt stopped, and an inch or two glinted under the growing morning light emanating from behind the thick clouds. Just as I started to relax, a tremendous boom rolled out across the atmosphere.

My neighbor awoke and cast off his soggy blanket. Was that thunder? He stood and listened to another rumble. This is no natural storm.

Nature answered by thickening the falling snow, and another roll of thunder accentuated the response. Shouts followed, and we ran back to the home hillocks proper.

During the night, something had broken into the empty dugouts and rooted around. Others were thinking it, but I was the one to say it. We cant just sit here and wait for that thing. We have to go hunt it down.

Full of anger, we headed out under crackling thunder and into blasting snow. I led the way, gripping a scythe. I wasnt sure exactly what I intended to do, but, if this thing ate our food, we would all starve. If it came down to it, I promised myself I wouldnt hesitate. Some of the neighbors had children, and I couldnt let starvation find them.

The wind was less brutal among the trees, but the thunder was no less tempestuous. Someone motioned.

Tracks. The snow had fallen irregularly here among the trunks, but the creature had left oblique prints in what little there was.

No toes, someone commented, vaguely horrified. Did it have hands? Fingers?

I never got a good look at it, I told them quietly.

We continued on.

I saw it first. There!

It bolted up from behind a bush, and we chased after. It was fast, and agile. Leaping away through the woods on two legs, it bolted out of sight, its hide flapping with each motion. One of our neighbors chased after it in a rage.

I shouted. Wait!

But the creature reappeared at the same time, quickly striking its foolish pursuer before fleeing another direction.

We ran to our comrade and propped him up, but it was clear that he wasnt going to make it. Blood gushed from his sliced-open midsection.

What the hell *is* that thing? my friend asked.

I had no answer. The others murmured hymns to God for our fallen neighbor. We left two with the downed farmer, and hurried on while we still had the scent. Now, beyond any promise, I *knew* I wouldnt hesitate. That savage invader -

We stopped in place, stunned.

A small bowl-shaped depression in the creek here formed a hollow in the rock under a small cliff. On the other side, set between the boles of two ancient trees, floated a purple gash in the air itself. Id thought the creature an invader, and now we understood how true that was. Creeping forward, scythe at the ready, I peered through the rift.

A tight and boulder-filled canyon curved off into the distance beyond. There were no other clues as to what kind of existence our invader was from. I turned around to report my findings - and saw it on the top of the hollow. My shout was, yet again, too late, and it cast a hand forward with a horrible short roar that echoed through the woods.

Another farmer fell, gashed in the head. How had it even done that? Had it propelled some sort of claw or talon faster than the eye could see? I yelled in anger and charged up around the hill toward the top of the shallow cliff while the others flanked the creature.

It blocked the first swing of my scythe with the single long talon it had used to kill the first of us, and its other limb - the distance killer - came around toward my midsection. I hit it away with one of my legs in desperation, and the creature gave that same short roar as something impacted a tree behind me. The sound had been loud enough to momentarily deafen, and, as the feeling of blood rushing in my head threatened to grow to an overwhelming roar, I fought it in keening silence.

Scythe met talon thrice, and its distance-killing limb took another farmer between strikes. Only my friend and two others remained, and those two fell to talon slashes before we managed to knock the creature from its desperate perch.

It fell into the bowl of the creek, impacting the water with a splash and the rocks underneath with a crash. I leapt down after it, approaching it with my scythe while it crawled away on its back using positions and muscle angles I found inherently disgusting and alien. I lifted my weapon in rage.

I froze.

The creature had managed to crawl back beyond the boles of the ancient trees, where a makeshift shelter had been set up to protect two smaller versions of it.

Children.

God was testing us, indeed.

My friend rushed up beside me, blade at the ready, but I stopped him.

I paid for my mistake in blood. The two child-creatures charged at us with talons of their own, stabbing my friend through the midsection and myself in one leg.

God had not been testing us. These were the spawn of his opposite.

Pained to my core, I slashed both of their heads off with one strike.

The larger creature roared with rage and sliced at another one of my legs. I fell to the snowy ground under a clap of thunder, but not before I finally ended its life.

I lay sobbing for a time, but the icy cold and falling snow provoked me to motion. I had a hunch about what was happening, and I limped over to the purple rift on my two remaining uninjured legs. Just on the other side of that rift in space, a mark similar to the one Id seen on the food stores had been made on the canyon rock.

This thing - creature, being, whatever it was - was not alone. It had made the marks for someone else.

Numbed by fear and specific need, I entered the rift. The first step through brought warmth and heat from a new sky, and I skittered along the canyon until it opened on the wider plains of an entirely different world.

I knew, then, that we were doomed. A throng - an army - an *ocean* of kin to that creature moved across the plains, a sea of dirty hunger flowing my way. Our food had been tested and marked. They would swarm across our lands and consume every single thing they found.

Running back to the rift, I studied the symbol on the rocks. If I could guess what change would indicate danger, then I might trick them into avoiding our world. A few pieces of chalky substance sat beneath, having been left there after use. Which colors meant warning, and which colors meant food? I didnt even have the same eyes. How could I know for sure?

I picked one and made my mark, praying to God that green meant danger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If I had to critique one thing, it's that your titles frankly aren't very attractive. While I don't particularly care for obvious click-bait titles, I pretty much didn't read any of your works until Conn's story; I had to go back through the Wiki and find the other (excellent) stories that I'd overlooked, because the titles simply didn't catch my eye.

Yep, I blame NoSleep's format for that. If you look further back in my post history (in the first year or two) I tried to choose real titles. After a few years of that I noticed the only thing that ever gets to the top of NoSleep are extraordinarily long click-baity titles. Can't beat 'em, join 'em. Here's one I just thought of off the top of my head that sounds straight from #1:

"For years I was an ice truck driver in Alaska that had to drive 60+ hours a run where no humans lived for thousands of miles while the sun didn't come up for months. This is the story of an impossible hitchhiker I once picked up out there in the middle of nowhere"

Intriguing concept, sure, but the title requirements make me sad. I think it's because people want the whole story minus the twist purely in the title, and only then will they click and read the expanded version.

 I feel it is safe to say that you are one of only a handful of (ex-)Nosleep authors who consistently puts out fresh, well-written works.

Thanks! I do hope to continue writing on there, but I'm starting to see the same content mill to the top over and over, and I don't think I'm the kind of author that can do blatant re-hashes well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is there a way to get physical descriptions of the characters or are they all left up to interpretation? I never know what the characters look like when im reading.

Some of the characters have been described by other characters, but the original NoSleep format definitely made it difficult. First-person stories don't often involve 'self description'. I might have to do a direct separate write-up for those interested. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wracked by fire, I fell to the ground palms first. An involuntary choke splattered white spray, red specks, and black globs onto damaged earth. I'd felt ultimate pain once before - and this was close. Reaching back in agony, I dug my fingers into the flesh near my spine, and pulled the purple biostone the rest of the way out.

A twitching knot of ice and fire belied muscles, nerves, and skin regenerating. The physical pain passed within five long breaths, but the mental anguish had just begun.

Ward Shaw. That was my name. It hadn't changed, but it was new again all the same. I was free. God almighty, after so many years - I was free!

Had I been able to feel emotions while enslaved, I would have been consumed by hopelessness and despair. That much I'd known, in the logical spaces of my mind, and that had been the extent of my personal existence. The person I was had only been present in hypotheticals and would-bes; never actually there, never in control. The control had been *hers.*

Hunched low as I was, in that moment, I couldn't do anything but hate her. I didn't care what she might or might not have done in defense of the human race. I wasn't even technically human anymore, and, had I not been mentally controlled, my core and allegiance would have been to my pack.

My pack! Letting the black course through my veins, I leapt up and ran.

This land had once been a thriving forest. Now, it lay in organic ruin. The trees had been spread out in an ocean of toppled trunks, the leaves had all been stripped away, and the scrub life that had once held a host of trails and smells and prey had been scattered into oblivion. Leaping and bounding along the maze of trunks with my shadowsight to guide me, I headed for the horizon I knew held my kin.

The trunk-ocean ended over the course of a long gradient of organic debris, slowly giving way to churned fields that had once served as farmland. Set in void, the Sun was a dark green blur above; I paused my run and drew the black away from my eyes for a moment. Brightness seared my sight, but I was desperate for warmth and open air as a free man. Holding my arms up, I thanked the life-giving yellow Sun for surviving the devastation. I had absolutely nothing - no world, no family, no possessions, no place - but that silent ongoing combustion in space warmed me just the same as anyone else.

Keeping my human sight active, I began walking. I could have pulled rage close. I could have chewed on bitterness. Instead, I let peace and resignation armor me. Some part of me had learned calm during my years of absolute enslavement, and I chose to keep that part alive.

My walk took me across messy earth and flattened stalks. Rocks and detritus stabbed my feet briefly, but the black within me hardened the skin of my soles in response. It was odd to be free and to embrace my dual nature for the first time, and it was quietly despairing to have two former homes that might no longer be welcoming. I sighted the first signs of people ahead, and only then did I realize that I had no clothes on. The tremendous grey flood had torn my uniform away, and had not deigned to return it upon evaporation.

It was a strange hurdle, to be sure, but I decided to remain at peace and expend the necessary time looking for clothes. I finally found muddy jeans and a loose shirt in a crushed backpack, and, though they split and tore slightly as I put them on, they otherwise sufficed.

The first stragglers stared as I stalked between their haggard groups. A young woman with a broken arm helped an old man with a bleeding forehead inch along. A teenager stepped among the devastated stalks, picking out potentially edible bits and piling them into a box he held under one arm. A baby sat by itself, crying.

I stood over the small child, shading it. It looked up with wide reddened eyes, its crying halted out of fear. The shadowblood within me urged me to strike down such a pathetically weak being, and one that was especially deserving for being from another tribe. I shook my head, pulling my human perspective forward. In some small way, it was another gift the purple biostone and that devil woman had given me: I had never been fully infested by the shadows. I could be one or the other, or a mix between. Cristina Thompson had promised me strength and power, and, in a way, she *had* delivered - the cost had just been far higher than I'd been promised.

The baby calmed as I picked it up. Looking around, I saw none from the scattered stragglers that seemed eager to claim it. I briefly brought blackness forth in my eyes, studying the creature for similarities in structure, appearance, or smell to any around, but there was no evident trail. In response to my suddenly dark eyes, the baby giggled and pulled my beard with a stubby little hand. Anger flared within at its impudence, but I slid back to humanity and sighed.

The density of wandering people increased as I proceeded further toward where headquarters had once stood. Out of the felled forests and fields, the cooling pools of extruded magma were more evident here, and I carefully avoided them. I'd last seen them under storm by sickly green lightning, and they looked far less menacing under airy and refreshing blue. The planet was healing now, rather than dying.

The building that had served as headquarters was, in its entirety, gone. A shallow mud pit was all that hinted at its former existence - that, and a thick crowd of various peoples discussing what to do. I sensed some of my kin among them, along with brownshirts, shambling corpse-things, normal humans, and a few of our shadowy parents. I handed the baby human to a passing startled woman and moved closer.

The ongoing conversation in that wide circle stopped as I appeared and looked down at each of the parties in turn.

His name was Danny. I knew him, and I felt no ill will toward him. Despite the fear that I could smell on him, he stepped forward and glared up at me. "Are you yourself?"

I knew what he was really asking. "She no longer has control over me."

Several nearby humans took a reflexive step back.

"What do you plan to do now?" their unlikely leader asked.

I was at peace, and I preferred it that way after so long spent dominated and enacting violence. "I have no plans."

He visibly relaxed. "So you're not -"

From out of the crowd, one of my kin leapt forward. I blocked his blade with my arm, grunting against the pain as metal cut down to bone. Black surged forward in my veins and in my vision, and I raised my other hand to stop his second blade. A two-handed push sent him flying to the ground, and he leapt up - straight into my firmly placed fist. His skull shattered from the impact, and he fell into mud with a crumpled face.

The entire exchange had taken only six seconds, and nobody else had been given adequate time to react. They all stared in surprise.

I took his blades and slid them between the loopholes of my found jeans. "He'll be fine. Excuse me while I deal with this internal issue." I turned to face a knot of my black-eyed kin. They had to have seen the broadcast trial on the First World, or simply saw me as an outsider now after my long absence. "If you view me as a traitor, or as an exile, speak now. We will deal with it as we always have."

None spoke.

The one I'd brutalized climbed to his feet, his face newly regenerated, and he slunk back to his fellows. As a group, they gave the slightest drop in stance. It was the most they would acknowledge while in the presence of those not of our kind. I moved to them, stood at their front, and turned my back to them.

Danny watched me warily for a beat, and then started his conversation back up. "Infrastructure's been heavily damaged, but we've still got Heath, basic communication, and portal hub facilities. Most of the underground bunkers and structures survived the flood. The real problem now is food."

While he continued the situation briefing, I turned my head and sighted Thomas among the brownshirts. His swarm of children were with him, too. While assigned to guard them, I'd learned all of their names and stories. I shouldn't have cared, but I did, in some vague esoteric manner. I would not kill them simply to exact revenge on Cristina Thompson. After all that had happened, that seemed unnecessary.

A corpse-thing burbled blood and then spoke. "What of the inter-reality dust? Will the problem repeat itself?"

A shadow answered. *Eight heavy spheres now float through our void, pulling and collecting ashes of the physical spaces that used to exist there.*

"So Cristina's plan didn't just pull it from our worlds," Danny realized, as a fresh breeze blew dirty hair out of his surprised face.

A white-haired brownshirt male nodded. "Her legacy - eight crushed realities, now the seeds of purification. A strategy to clean up future voids and future contaminations."

Another human spoke up. I think I'd caught his name as Alek once or twice before. "Can you ever put the Shield back up?"

"If we manage to rebuild it somehow, maybe someday," Danny replied, looking to the brownshirts.

Their white-haired leader sighed. "We're a shadow of our former selves. No insult intended."

*No insult taken,* the lead shadow replied.

Danny closed one fist. "So we're open to the multiverse for the time being, and possibly indefinitely. What do we do?" He looked at me. "What will your black-eyed soldiers do?"

I knew what they wanted, because I was them, and they were me. We were the same - pack animals - and there were less than two hundred of us left. "We'll run the borders. We'll hunt, and defend." I sensed my kin bowing to that instruction behind me.

The burbling corpse-thing spoke up. "I can help defend against physical threats as well, provided you give me my own reality from among those remaining."

Danny looked to several of his human allies, and then agreed.

*We will eat anything that threatens from the mental plane,* the shadow added. *But not because we like you. Don't get an ego about it. We just like to torture and eat things. And you happen to be somewhat within our void anyway. And we still get all your minds when you die. Can't very well let a source of fun experiences get wiped out.*

Suppressing a smile, Danny agreed to that as well.

"And we'll try to keep *them* honest," the white-haired brownshirt offered. "If your protection is still offered, as we all agreed. Perhaps we can work on the protective and transportive technologies of old as well. Too, we consider our original alliance with humanity still in effect."

Many hands were shaken, as much as hands could be shaken among entities undead, mental, and physical. I alternated sights often, evaluating the participants. This was going to be life, if indeed life was going to continue - a mishmash of unlikely allies circling the wagons against the unknown terrors of the multiverse. But what resources still remained to support rebuilding here?

As the talks finished and the crowd dispersed, I stayed close to Danny as he talked about the true threat: food.

"We have to get everything repaired or set up as fast as possible," he told a man with shoulder-length hair. "We've got teams trying to fix and rebuild the farming systems here, but we've got six hundred and fifty billion people to feed and next to no food. It's going to get very bad before it gets better."

The man nodded.

Danny looked to me. "Ward, will you help Jay and his men return home? Their world is right near the border, and possibly very dangerous. They could use your help."

I regarded them both. It was a soldier's task, and none were better suited. "Yes. In fact, take three of my men with every team. These tasks are too important to go unprotected."

"Thank you," Danny offered, still visibly unsure how to treat me.

Instead of bothering with his uncertainty, I picked two trustworthy lieutenants from my remaining black-eyed followers, and we set out alongside a large group that was comprised fully of humans all from the same destination world. On our way out, someone offered the three of us each a set of emerald armor and a sapphire rifle, and we gladly took weapons we recognized as extremely powerful. We'd stolen one of each long ago for Cristina, but I was unsure how these people had acquired so many more. I supposed it didn't matter.

We walked along flattened fields through until sunset, taking advantage of the slowly healing cracks in space while they lasted. Our going was slow, for we had a number of women and children along for the trek. I didn't think it was a good idea to bring families along, but it was their risk to take. Jay, the human in charge, had one woman and two female children with him. That was dangerously distracting for a leader, and I ordered one of my lieutenants to specifically guard them.

What was I supposed to feel about all this? I was free now, but immediately settling back into the role of soldier and guardian. I could only assume the woman I hated was dead, given that the purple biostone had more or less shut off and ejected itself from my spine. The brother my human half had once had was long dead on a world that no longer existed, and the tribe I'd become a part of was now just a handful of survivors. Lacking any sense of triumph or motivation, I simply let myself enjoy the physicalities of the hike.

Most of the farm realities we walked through under the evening sunset had been leveled, and were filled with hungry people looking for bits and pieces to eat. Danny had been correct: this was going to get very bad before it had any chance to get better.

We stopped for the night in a grove of still-standing willow trees in a vast plain empty of people or movement. By shadowsight, I studied the horizons, but nothing was alive out there. The Shield was down, our defenders had not yet taken their positions, and absolutely anything could show up at any time - but existence seemed to be giving us a rare break.

"No fires," I ordered, gently tapping my slung sapphire rifle for effect.

Jay's mate glared, but complied. The forty-odd men, women, and children huddled in extremely makeshift tents and shelters they'd brought with them while my two men and I stood out in the chilly night breezes unconcerned. The seasons were changing, and the summer was ending. How lucky had the humans gotten in having this crisis happen during the spring and summer? If it had been winter, hundreds of billions would have frozen or starved far faster. Such a mundane and easily overlooked detail - but it would become extremely relevant soon.

He'd been hovering around my awareness since the start of the trek. Now, he crept from the tents and stood alongside me in the windy darkness. He said nothing.

His smell was very similar, but subtly different. "You're not him."

"Who?"

"The one that looked like you. The one we black-eyeds tortured, brainwashed, and employed as a spy, and the one who accompanied myself and others on the First World. He was with us through the trial and our escape under the white hole."

"Ah, that would be Noah Two. I'm just Noah." He paused as he briefly considered all that we had put his duplicate through. "Fulmer."

I'd seen more than my share of strangeness, but this was definitely up there. I'd never had any idea there was a duplicate of the man we'd tortured, although I'd heard the tribe had tried to brainwash and interrogate him again after I'd been separated from them. "How are there more than one of you?"

"A natural quantum duplication rift in my home reality," he offered, raising an arm to scratch his own back briefly. "Sounds insane, but it exists. There's like, a thousand versions of Noah Two running around now."

I turned and finally looked at him. Through shadowsight, I studied the various blotchy greens and oranges in his face. He didn't appear to be lying, though I could only guess. "Could you use that rift to duplicate food?"

He lowered his voice to a whisper. "That's the true intent of this mission."

I had nothing else to say to him. "Understood."

He lingered for several minutes, gazing out at the smooth plains by starlight.

I kept my eyes on the horizon, scanning my third of the land out there for movement. I was actually itching for something to happen, because I wanted to feel the thrill of firing that devastating sapphire weapon again.

He spoke, revealing his true reason for approaching me. "Are you going to keep the secret?"

A bit of anger swelled in my chest, only to conflict with the peace I was trying to keep there. "I haven't decided yet."

"Well, decide soon, and firmly. Someone might use the book on you someday -"

I laughed. "That didn't go well for the last one who tried it."

"Still, they might." He held up the device. By normal eyes, it was a large book dimly outlined by the light of distant stars. By shadowsight, it was painful to behold. "You have to commit to your decision, or your soul will spill the beans."

"They trusted you with that device?" I asked.

He lowered it to his side. "For many reasons. One being the importance of finding that canyon and duplicating food. I told them I might need it for information. Another reason - I'm the one who will write down all of our stories."

I narrowed my eyes. "When?"

"Soon. Every time I wake up, I have the memories of thousands of Noah Twos in my head, and they're all out there - interviewing people, getting their experiences, trying to understand the full extent of what happened here through the words of the people that lived it. Every single one of us played a part in this crisis, and every single one of us will play a part in what comes next."

Even through my darkly glittering emerald armor, I felt a chill inherited from the ice my dark parents had instilled in every cell in my body. His duplicate had been useful for his emotion-sensing abilities, but I now understood where they'd come from. "You're our gwellion"

"I've been called that before, yes."

"How do you care about anything?" I asked, wondering if his insight would help me fight my ennui and deep inner pain born of total loss. "How do you feel things for people?"

He shook his head. "I don't know. I've always had a sense that the purpose of my existence, somehow, some way, was to be a finder and observer of bad things. That's the funny thing about stories - every tremendous disaster has a witness. Otherwise, there is no story at all. By the very act of hearing a story, you're guaranteeing someone survived to witness it and tell it later."

My pulse began quickening. "But how did you step in? How did you bring yourself to interfere?"

"Maybe we're not just the roles we've been given," he said quietly, looking up at the stars. "It took a great deal of suffering and self-exploration - literally - to find the ability to care within myself. What have you learned from your experiences?"

"Nothing," I responded, distant. "All I ever did was lose things. My brother, my humanity, my tribe. It's like a palpable despair that follows me everywhere I go. Not too long ago, I briefly had my mental freedom when someone tried to use that book on me. In the grip of that despair and mocking hatred, all I wanted was to take down the Shield and end this ridiculous series of travesties that claims to be my life."

The silhouette of his head tilted down. "Wow. That's dark."

I clenched one fist. "All of you have purpose. An observer that interferes. A kid who commands. A brain in a vat that wants to help. A loner that leads. A soldier that never won a fight in his life, but loves harder than anyone else. A teacher that destroys some worlds to save others. What am I, among all that?"

Noah had no answer but the only one possible. "That's something you have to figure out for yourself. I wouldn't say those people define themselves the way you do, though. I bet you probably hate Cristina Thompson, and focus on the billions she killed to save a trillion - but this book has been with us every step of the way, and she found it only through absolute despair. In a way, her daughter's death and subsequent theft by the Preacher gave us all a path forward. She and her family are gone now, but they produced the opportunity to use this book with their lives, and this book changed everything." He studied it by starlight. "It's strange, isn't it? It's just an information tool, but it was always there, bouncing among the threads of history."

He walked away, lost in thought.

I remained at my post, my heart heavy, and my thoughts spinning. A glow radiated out along the sky, and blue returned. The Sun crested the horizon, and the small camp began stirring to life. I waited, still thinking, until they'd packed up. I tightened the strap on my sapphire rifle and began walking again without a word.

Leaving the farmland realities, we began encountering more haphazardly colonized worlds. The Crushing Fist had not been kind to the cities here, and a great number of buildings lay collapsed or strewn along for miles. These were the worlds of man in ruins, and, although the human race existed for the moment, I could not see how life could continue among nothing but wreckage.

Around mid-day, we slid through a rift and emerged under a blue sky with strange fading patches of other colors among it.

"Is it healing?" Jay shouted, arms up in excitement. He turned to his group. "The damage from Jonathan Cortin's nearby world must be fading now that the pressure is gone!"

I moved alongside, observing with icy calm as the group happily ran down the mountainside. I couldn't afford to get distracted. My eyes searched the forest. How was it still standing? My two lieutenants remained on guard, also concerned.

Through the woods, the group emerged at the edge of a city that seemed rather untouched. The buildings had been lightly ravaged by multiversal threats, but the grey flood had apparently not descended here.

We walked down the streets of a suburb, and Jay stopped in front of one moderately trashed house. He kicked at a pile of debris in the yard, judging the extent of the damage, and then came back to grab his family and cry tears of happiness with them. I watched them, feeling empty.

Noah nodded me away, and he and I pretended to go on patrol. The hike was short - or maybe it was long - but I had no thoughts and no feelings. These people had come home, and home had been waiting for them. Where was *my* home? The calm land and sky seemed alive with notes of some distant metaphorical violin, playing a song of nostalgic happiness for the human race, but not for me.

We came to a stop on a forested hill near a cliff. A huge number of people had recently been here, as evidenced by footprints, trampling, and leftover tools. Had that been the Noah Twos? 

"No!" he shouted, running up to the cliff face where quakes had dropped a mountain of rubble. "It's gone"

I studied the rocks. "What if we clear it?"

He kicked one in rage. "I can feel it. It's not here anymore."

My question was simple. "What now?"

"We go back to headquarters. Tell them what we found. That's all we can do."

He and I slipped away without returning to that group back in the city. My lieutenants would guard them, and there was a great deal of rebuilding to be done. We didn't need to distract them.

The hike back through the realities was quicker with just the two of us. Noah didn't speak a word on the way, and I had nothing to say to anyone. By evening, we found ourselves on a dirt road that cut through long flattened fields. A sea of humans had begun preparing to sleep.

As darkness fell, the two of us reached the tents that signified headquarters. By two bright lights, Danny studied reports that had been brought to him on paper.

Noah clearly sensed more than I saw. "What's going on?"

Danny shook his head. "Heath's gone."

"Gone?"

"He said goodbye after I told him about the alliance. Said humans had to make good on their deals, or something. Haven't heard from him since."

Noah offered the book.

Danny refused it. "No. He's at peace now. That's what I want to believe."

"I think that's the case," Noah told him, his tone quiet, as if he was somehow responsible, in part, for Heath's fate. "He was a good man. His torment is over. He's free now."

I guessed I would never know what happened between them. Instead, I reported on what we'd found, and Danny put a hand to his forehead.

"We can only feed two hundred billion people at the moment," he said. "Another hundred billion in a few months."

"Do you have a plan?" Noah asked.

Danny looked past him, at a great deal of movement and preparation by firelight. "Alek's people and the First Worlders are already leaving, for various reasons. Alek's people don't feel like they belong here, and they want to find a new home. The First Worlders pissed people off mightily by refusing to help with the Fight, and they think it's best to move on, too."

I started calculating in my head. "How many people are leaving as a result?"

"Not enough."

That was my answer. I suddenly understood. "Send out a call for volunteers."

"Volunteers?" Danny asked. "For what?"

"For leaving," I told him. "We saw the strength of humanity as hundreds of millions poured into the Fight to die for the cause. The Fight's not over - it's just changed. Tell them you need three hundred and fifty billion volunteers to go with Alek's people and the First Worlders. Tell them the black-eyed army is going with them. Tell them we'll find a home, because that's what we'll do. We'll set off on the greatest pilgrimage mankind has ever known, and we'll find a home or we'll die, because we have to."

Danny gulped, but the men around him were already stepping forward.

Noah handed me the book with a calm glance of support. "Seems the threads of history are taking a path away from here. I think you'll need this."

That was my answer. I didn't have a place here. Who was I? I was a man in search of a home. I'd run wild in the multiverse for years; I'd seen it all, and I had the strength and skills to guard those who hadn't. I suddenly understood my role. I would go, and take whatever black-eyed tribe members wanted to follow. We would guide and protect the new Exodus.

We would have a chance to survive - and that would have to be enough.

Fantastic work on all that :) sometimes I go there and read through it all with a sense of wonder. 

 One more chapter to go in this story, and I'm seriously hoping it isn't the last...

I was actually thinking about doing something I'm not sure other authors have done - have a sort of vote of what people want to see. I have no problem continuing the stories of these characters and the places involved on an ongoing basis (since quite a bit more happens after this). The current crisis is definitely solved, wrapping the 'series', but a new tale could begin if people want more. Life isn't going to simply be fun and candy now. </TEXT>

As I swam toward it, almost completely exhausted, it closed with a snap. The pressure had sealed it shut.

Ok, what else was there?

Nothing.

I waded in the storm, feeling myself grow heavier.

I couldn't help but laugh. Conn and I had held a little re-marriage ceremony in the woods while the Noahs had duplicated themselves. He'd said it was probably goodbye, that this was probably a one-way trip. He'd been smarter than me. At least I would see him soon. I hoped, too, that Thomas was safe, wherever he was. I knew the kids would take care of him.

Above, I saw stars flare, and galaxies race forward in the sky. They grew huge, and then sailed past, as the universe started collapsing. Incredible gravitational shifts sent me flying up in the air and then back down into the water to wade some more.

To my right, above the roiling foam, a portal began to open. I saw, through it, a large group of brownshirts using their collective will to force their way through Amber One's shield - and the growing weight upon it.

It was a nice effort, and my heart leapt in my chest for a moment - but the portal quickly went white as the Regret Demon appeared yet again, with malice. It'd been hounding me ever since I'd royally pissed it off on the First World. I hated to say it, but my interactions with it had cost us Orthogonal Control's safety, and now my only escape. I definitely regretted doing business with it.

"Bastard!" I shouted, just as the world imploded.

---

I looked up from the book. All of my friends and a ton of refugees stood around me on the grassy plains, waiting to hear the fate of the woman that had saved us all.

"Did she make it?" Danny asked.

I didn't respond.

"Thomas, *did she make it?*"

I could only shake my head. The other kids rushed in to hug me, but I only felt numb. </TEXT>

I stood in the waist-high heavy grey waters as they began evacuating. "You too," I told the Noahs.

Three and Four went, but Noah Two lingered.

"If you die," I asked him, eyes on my consoles. "Do you think your memories will go to the other Noahs?"

"I think they will," he responded, grim.

"So you can't really die, can you? Not the same way as everyone else."

"If all the other Noahs die, I would go away forever," he responded. "But I don't think having ones memory transferred is the same thing as still being alive."

I nodded, my heart dark. "Go."

"Good luck," he said softly, before splashing to the elevator to ride up with his duplicates.

Just like that, I found myself alone in a bunker, my computers connected to seven other worlds and the main Shield generator's now-empty dome. The portal there closed as I watched, indicating that Danny had gotten to safety.

**Aww, that's no fun. Why'd you send them away? Hearing all of you scream together is exquisite.**

I paused the expansion of the network of backup shield generators, keeping them stable. "Heath, what do you see?"

"The pressure's acceleration has leveled off we're still going to collapse in less than ten minutes, though."

I nodded bitterly. "Whatever the Crushing Fist is, it can probably outpace us. We can try to put all the power we have into the Shield generators and pray the Fist tops out before we do, or we can try another plan."

Heath seemed hopeful. "What's the other plan?"

"I've got nothing." I leaned over the consoles, feeling hopeless, but still trying to think through the problem. I turned my head to the dusty bunker air. "What do *you* think we should do?"

**Why would I help you?** the voice laughed. **I can show you something, though.**

I stood tall, anger rising in my chest. "Yeah? What?"

The world suddenly expanded, and my consciousness rose free as a phoenix of fire surging into infinite depths. If I'd had a mouth, I would have screamed.

**Behold the true meaning of infinity,** the voice explained, deadly serious now.

==========



My blazing awareness soared over a sea in which all the flecks of foam were universes. We sailed across that ocean at limitless speeds, diving deep to find a golden jewel in the currents. It was a Shielded sphere of worlds, the same as ours, and seven hundred billion years in the past.

**Time has no meaning in the multiverse. Infinite possibility gives rise to infinite complexity. Order arises briefly from chaos in predictable patterns.**

We zoomed in on that Sphere being slowly crushed near a wide canyon of missing realities. The specificity increased, driving me further down - to a series of farm realities being flooded by grey compressed space. Billions of people ran in terror only to be swept away. One of those hapless people looked like me.

**Do you see?**

We leapt to another golden bubble in another ocean a trillion years before that. Here, the Amber Worlds began to explode one by one until none were left, and the woman that looked like me went out with the final blast, still thinking she could succeed if she pushed the generators hard enough.

The voice drew my awareness from golden trinket to golden trinket, showing me our situation repeated a hundred times down through time without limit. The seas of the multiverse roiled and changed in constant motion, producing worlds like ours every so often.

With a shock, I returned to my body.

Mocking laughter hit my senses for a fourth time. **You** *cannot* **win. You have done this and died so many times - asking me for help is nothing but hilarious. You never learn your lesson.**

My lesson? I began wading as the rising grey waters topped the computers. They'd been built waterproof by expert engineers long ago, but I would not survive much longer down here. The concrete ceiling grew closer as the water level rose. I wanted to ask that voice if it was behind the Crushing Fist, but, somehow, I knew that question would only make it laugh more. Why would that be funny, though? What lesson did I need to learn?

"What's going on, Cristina?" Heath cried. "I estimate four, maybe five minutes. What do we do?"

Come on, think it through. Wasn't that what I always told my students? What lesson wasn't I heeding? And now, the enemy that was possibly causing the Crushing Fist -

An enemy.

Was it an enemy?

Had it shown me the truth to instill despair?

Or

I'd learned once before that seeing enemies where none existed could lead to disaster. It had only been through the children that I'd been able to see without the filter of hatred over my eyes.

What if -

"Heath, *what if we're not under attack?*" I shouted.

"How can we not be under attack?" he asked, his voice strained with terror and despair. "Why would anyone do this if they're not trying to destroy us?"

**The** *vwaal* **one doesn't see it**

I knew that word. I knew who and what the voice was - the embodiment of sadism, torture, and mocking delight. Where the shadow creatures were mere expressions, limbs, or aspects, this was the core voice of Hunger itself; a limitless concept that had always existed and always would exist. It was only speaking to me now at the prospect of a trillion screaming sacrifices - and because we had allied with some small part of it.

It was trying to help in the only way it knew how.

"Nobody would do this without meaning to destroy us," I shouted to Heath as my forehead touched cold shaking concrete and the waters began pushing up past my arms. "That much is true - but *what if nobody is behind it at all?*"

"Then it's got to be -"

"The tar," I said, jumping to what the Noahs had always seen in the raving inbetweens, and something Danny had said Alek's people had seen on their trek to our worlds. "Not stardust universe dust. Reality dust. The remains of all those destroyed realities, attracted by the polarization of the Shield itself!"

"And the more it piles up, and the stronger we make the Shield, the more it's attracted to us," Heath said, aghast. "The Shield *is* the problem."

"We have to turn it off," I realized, my heart sinking. "And let the ravages of the multiverse have free reign in our realities and we can't just shut it off, either. All that weight is still out there." I angled my head up as I waded as high as I could, breathing from an inch between grey waters and concrete. "Wait! We can still do this! Heath, use the main generator controls to *eject all the Amber Worlds.*"

"Why?!"

"We shoot the Amber Worlds off into the multiverse, and power up their Shields to pull the gathered dust off of the main Shield before turning it off!"

He sounded horrified. "What about all those people on the Amber Worlds?"

"Those deaths are on me," I told him, my open lips against concrete. "I'm sorry. Set up the procedure, and then leave the activation to me."

He said nothing further, except: "It's done."

A single red button glowed on the consoles under the frothing grey water. Taking a deep breath as the heavy water slid fully above my head, I dove down, swam for it, and hit the red button with my hand.

Immediately, the grey around me began trembling, and I turned to swim toward the elevator. Three strokes brought me to them as my lungs started burning, and I braced my legs and pulled them apart.

Another stroke took me into the shaft beyond, and I squeezed up past the grated elevator into the shaft proper. Emergency lights in the shaft showed a long way up, and I was already half-desperate for air. Kicking and clawing my way up, I used the extreme buoyancy of the heavy water to shoot up at a rapid pace.

A heavy blanket of fuzziness glimmered around my awareness as I pulled open the top doors, swam forward, and burst up into open air with a scream and a gasp.

Where only two hours ago there had been verdant fields and distant hills, there was now only a rushing grey ocean. This reality was already in the process of ejection from the main Shield, and that meant I had to get out quickly. I couldn't possibly swim back to the original rift, could I? Would it even be there?

The clear blue sky began imploding above. Grey waters poured in from nowhere.

What was there to do? Where was there to go?

Hastily, I reached down into grey and pulled my compass chip from my pocket. A few clicks showed a remaining natural rift maybe a quarter-mile away - I wasn't sure where it would deposit me if this reality was sailing through the multiverse, but anywhere was better than here. I swam for it even as vast whirlwind spouts of compressed space began tearing apart reality itself all around.

I saw it ahead, glowing a strange shade of purple.

	<TEXT> "Cristina, we'll have to find another way in!"

Swimming as hard as I could toward the rift, I fought the rushing heavy water. The grey liquid wasn't wet, but it was certainly dense, and the surging force ran near overwhelming. "No time!" As I splashed forward, I turned my head up to catch a breath, and caught sight of a radio tower whose sturdy base had allowed it to remain standing. "Noah-18, can you climb that and wait for Conn to catch up?"

Noah-18 let one of the currents take him back toward it, and he was out of earshot in moments. The other hundred and eighty five Noahs we had left pushed on. Noah Two was right behind me, half swimming against the flood and half pulling himself along using random jutting rocks. "We can feel it," he said between ragged breaths, his eyes haunted.

The rift was so close - I pushed off from a rock and tried to dive for it, but I missed. Noahs Two and Five leapt out, grabbed my outstretched legs, and pulled me back. I was forced to acknowledge what he had said. I was already sure of the answer. "Feel what?"

"Pain, anguish, and terror like we've never sensed before," he shouted through the crashing spray. "A trillion people being crushed, drowning, dying."

I took a deep breath to shout back in return. "How long?" 

Noah Five answered for him. A sea of similar grim faces watched me from their various perches in the rapids beyond, their expressions framed by dim emerald armor and strapped sapphire rifles. "Now. And getting worse, over maybe the next two hours."

So, I couldn't wait for Conn. I'd have to try to do it alone - no, the task wasn't the problem. It was the thought of having to go through the end by myself that hurt me. I couldn't sense near-future emotions like the Noahs, but I had an icy inkling that I wasn't going to make it through this alive. During one of our nights camped out by that duplicating canyon, Noah Two had said that people like me didn't get happy endings.

But people like Conn and Thomas did, I'd told him. That thought had kept me going, and still motivated me now. Leaping forward with all my strength, I dove headfirst under the grey waves, going out of reach and deeper into the torrents.

The currents were brutal between the bases of the rocks, but I kept my eyes open despite the pressure and pain and pulled myself along with my hands. Forward to the left, pull with all my strength, forward to the right, pull with all my strength, lungs burning - with the last of my breath, I shot straight up and reached out blindly.

My arms closed around the soft bottom edge of the rift.

I willed the fiery and exhausted muscles in my arms to tense, and their meager force slowly pulled me up and in. Falling onto a cramped surface I perceived as desert sand, I turned and held out my arms to pull a desperately swimming Noah up from the water. One by one, we formed a chain and dragged our entire remaining squad into the raving inbetweens. The hundred and eighty six of us could hardly fit in the rift, and I spilled out the other end first.

Soft green grass awaited my tired hands. Clambering weakly to my feet, I scanned my sight across lush grasslands, a healthy little creek, and a clear sky. Even while aware of every passing second, I couldn't help but stare. This place was completely untouched, as if the Crushing Fist had never been anything but a dream. The verdant landscape here was a far cry from the illusory desert sands I'd just stumbled across in the raving inbetweens; that terrain had been very different from Conn's perceived white hospital floor, and I hadn't had the heart to tell him that, where he saw the place we'd lost our daughter, I saw only the place where I'd lost *myself*.

A bookish man with brown-rimmed glasses leapt up from a tech station that had been established near the back end of a clean white pickup truck. "Hello?!"

Sweet breezes blew my ragged hair out of my face, and I reflexively grabbed something and tied it back as the lanky scientist-type approached. I could already guess that he was an engineer or techie, and that he'd come here to investigate the rift that had opened in space. It was one of only three cracks in Amber One's individual Shield, and I'd banked on it having drawn attention. "Name and role?" I called out.

He stopped about ten feet away, suddenly awkward. "Ahhm Russell sir?" He seemed unfamiliar with military protocol. "Fritz Russell. I'm a maintenance technician."

"Civilian?" I asked, as a stream of gemstone-clad duplicates began climbing out of the rift behind me.

"Yeah" Russell pushed his glasses up on his nose and stared past me. "Is that Hegemony tech? Awesome! Can I get a look at it?"

"No."

"Oh. That's fine. You guys from the First World? I wondered if somebody would be showing up. I don't like the stats on our Shield, not one bit. I thought something might be going on."

He had no idea. "The generator controls near here?"

"Oh, not at all," he replied, his eyes widening as more and more Noahs piled out onto green grass. "But we can use a secondary access station back at my facility."

I decided not to clarify my role or intent. He seemed the type to latch onto specifics and use them against me, while vague unknowns would leave him uncomfortable. "Let's go. Immediately."

"Okay it's not too far."

As we approached his white pickup truck, two little boys and a woman looked up from a spread of food that had been laid out on a baby blue blanket. A picnic? These people were having picnics with ultimate destruction two hours away? I tried not to scowl, and purposely forgot their names the moment they introduced themselves. I couldn't afford to get distracted.

I rode in the cab, and Russell's family rode in the back with Noahs Two through Six. The rest began walking down the road after us, minus two who waited behind for Conn to catch up.

As Russell drove hurriedly along a smooth dirt road, I glanced over. Contact with the Amber Worlds had always been extremely rare. "How many people are there on this Earth?"

He grinned with pride. "We're up to seven billion now. All descendants of the original work crew of fifty thousand."

"Making the best of being trapped?" I asked, studying his face.

"I wouldn't call it being trapped," he said, his expression calm and peaceful. "Our ancestors knew what they were volunteering for. And it's not so bad here. I don't know what life is like out there for you guys, other than the depressing updates we get every decade or so, but I think we do pretty well for ourselves. No crime, no war. Plenty for everybody."

The gorgeous landscape passing by the window lent support to his claims. A few homesteads dotted the horizons, but I saw no evidence of cities or heavy traffic. The crew that had volunteered to come here a thousand years before had been the best of the best, and they'd been more or less sealed off since, out of reach of humanity's greed and decay. I would be sorry to see that peace torn asunder. I couldn't tell Russell that my plan involved expanding his Shield to include the full range of human hope and poison. All of the Amber Worlds would suddenly find themselves thrust back into the thick of things.

"Here we are," he said, pulling over in a gravel parking lot outside a rather humble metal and brick facility. Seeing my expression, he added, "It's mostly underground."

That made sense. The Noahs piled out, followed by Russell's family, and we trekked across gravel toward the humble structure. As we walked, I watched the two little boys stick out their tongues at their glittering escorts. The two were twins, so they thought nothing of the surrounding men having the same faces. Their mother, though, was visibly concerned, and urged her boys to remain well-behaved.

Noahs Five and Six remained up top with Russell's family while the rest of us took a long elevator down into the metal-framed earth. How much time was all this taking? I tried not to look outwardly agitated as I counted off the minutes and seconds in my head. We'd already lost half an hour just getting here.

A subtle tremor shook the elevator shaft, and Russell gripped a handlebar. "Whoah, that was weird."

Without his family present, and nearing our destination, I decided it was time to tell him. "It's going to get worse."

He looked down, and his glasses glinted under the elevator's harsh artificial light. "I know. I didn't want to tell Elise and the boys, but a rift like that one up the valley is way more than just ominous. How bad is it out there?"

Pleasantly surprised by his aptitude, I told him the truth. "Ninety minutes."

"Til what?" he asked, gripping the elevator's handlebar tighter.

I think he already suspected, but he deserved to know for sure. "The crushing collapse of the entire First World empire."

He went pale, and said nothing further.

The elevator came to a sudden stop, and he lifted the main bar out of the way before leading us forward down a narrow hallway whose style and construction immediately reminded me of so many installations back home - a home that no longer existed.

The underground bunker hummed to life as we entered. It was exactly as Conn had guessed; a wide ring of consoles, computers, and monitors that hooked into the global Shield systems. I couldn't help but smile. He would definitely have nothing to do when he got here but stand around and fret.

Looking rather sick, Russell darted to the nearest chair, knocked away some dust, and sat. "We wouldn't be able to communicate out for a couple years, yet, but the cracks have changed things." He typed a few commands, and two of the fourteen large monitors in the concrete walls lit up. "Yeah, we've got a signal."

A distant mocking laugh reached my ears. I turned. Noahs Two through Four stood behind me, watching the monitors intently.

The data finished loading, and one of the monitors began displaying a real-time representation of our tremendously squished and distorted sphere of realities, many of which were blinking red. Russell put a hand over his mouth and stared.

I couldn't spare the time to fully update him. Moving to the communication console, I tried to make sense of the ancient controls. They were very similar to modern First World tech, so - there! "Heath, are you out there?" A deep tremor shook my chair, while the lights flickered and dust drifted down around us.

After a burst of static, his despairing voice finally came through. "Cristina! It's everywhere! So many people are -"

"I know," I interrupted compassionately. "We have to focus now. We're gonna get through this. Are you in contact with any other Noah teams?"

"Yes, actually," he replied, suppressing his fear and concern in favor of hope. "They told me what you're trying to do, and I've been keeping in contact for the last few hours while they wait for you."

That was good news, but our plan wouldn't work unless we had at least eight backup generators working together. "How many teams have checked in?"

"Including you, all ten."

I laughed out loud, and turned briefly to Noah Two. "Good on you guys."

The three Noahs nodded with determined relief.

"Amber Five's team has Alek at the helm," Heath added.

"*That* Alek?" I asked, wary.

"Yes."

I'd never met the man from the outer lands, but I was well aware he'd been the deciding vote to exile me. "Can you connect all our feeds? We all need to work together."

"Sure thing. Hold on."

One by one, the monitors in the walls began displaying other bunkers that were very similar to our own. In each, a large group of Noahs manned the controls. The seventh monitor from the left showed different exhausted faces, including one unshaven and beleaguered young man with determined eyes. "Alek?" I asked.

He nodded. "You must be her."

I snorted. "Yeah, I'm her."

"I hope you know why I voted -"

I held up a hand. "It doesn't matter. Time is too short to worry about it."

"Understood."

One of the Noahs at Amber Two spoke up. "What's the plan?"

"We expand each backup Shield at the same time, overlapping our bubbles until they push out as one. Basically, we're going to create a new outer Shield sourced from ten different weaker locations at once, instead of from one massive generator at the center."

Russell turned in his chair, aware now of my plan, but also aware of the need. "What's wrong with the main generator?"

"It won't last much longer," I told him. "For a lot of reasons, none of which we can do anything about. Speaking of -" I turned. "Heath, can you get Danny on the line as well?"

The second to last monitor on the right blinked on. That young man I'd taught in the forest the year before gazed back at me, now older and stronger in perceptible and imperceptible ways. Above him, a white and gold domed space vibrated and dropped dust. Behind him, I saw a startling crew of motley new allies.

On his end, he leaned over his console with a wide grin. "I knew you'd show up at the last minute to save us all yet again."

"Don't jinx it," I replied, smiling despite myself. "You've done well. Shaw told me about the alliance you've forged. Rather incredible, if I do say so myself."

"I thought you'd like it. I tried to do what I thought you would do."

I shook my head. "No, you did far better. I -" I hesitated, aware of my own greatest flaw. "I see enemies everywhere, in everything and everyone, and it almost cost me everything a second time. It was only through you, Thomas, and the kids that I could see things differently. I would never have been able to see the opportunity you saw, let alone capitalize on it."

He gulped and looked away for a moment, fighting brimming tears. "That means a lot to me."

"Of course," I said. "Let's get this done."

"Right!" He turned and shouted an order. In the background, I saw the brownshirts open a portal and begin evacuating the entire mix of strange allies.

"Keep a few brownshirts behind," I suggested. "We might need portals."

He nodded.

"Alright," I said to all of our teams. "Let's start scaling up the power. It's alright if the individual Shields get weaker as you spread them out; it's the combined overlap that'll shore things up. Be prepared: it's going to get worse where you are before it gets better."

A long row of monitor-framed nods came in response. Hands worked consoles, and, beside me, Russell followed suit. A new tremble radiated through the very Earth itself, but this one was hopeful.

"It'll take a couple minutes to bring the extra capacities online," he said, controlling his breathing to keep from vomiting. "Do we have anybody at Orthogonal Control?"

The four of us present in the room looked at him with puzzled expressions.

He realized we didn't know what he meant, and he went into scientist explanation mode. "There's an extra artificial reality they created alongside the Shields and the Amber Worlds. It isn't part of the multiverse proper - it goes off into another type of existence completely. It's probably safe from what's going on out there, and it's got tech repositories full of weird stuff from the multiverse they didn't know what to do with back then. Might be something useful there." Typing quickly, he brought up specific electronic documents. "Yeah, see here. I knew I remembered it right."

I stared at him for nearly ten seconds, processing what he was saying. I'd heard about it before, as a children's bed-time tale, but we'd lost so much over the last ten centuries of social change and growing apathy "How do we get there?"

"I dunno," he responded, looking to the Noahs and me in turn. "It's secret and hidden for a reason. Kind of a last ditch refuge in case of emergency, or something like that." He turned back to his console, peering at the data. "Definitely says the location is highly classified."

"Heath," I called out. "Can you run a search for this Orthogonal Control?"

"Already on it," he replied. "Not finding anything."

"Not even an ancient diary entry or something?" I asked, frustrated.

"You wouldn't," Russell explained, reading further. "The human mind can't retain memories from that mode of existence. If you leave it, you can't remember ever having been there."

A weird sensation coursed all over my bare skin. That missing piece had haunted me ever since my first encounter with the Regret Demon. Was it possible that *I had already been there once before?* Something about the notion felt eerily right. "Danny, do you still have that shoe I gave you?"

"It's back at headquarters somewhere," he shouted over a rather nasty little quake. Turning around, he explained something to a white-haired brownshirt man. In turn, that man opened a portal - into rushing grey. The portal closed a moment later, and Danny turned to us with a shocked expression. "Headquarters is gone"

What else? What else did we have? If I couldn't remember - what options did we have? "The book! Where's the book?"

"It was there, too," he said, his voice trembling.

Then there was only one other choice. "Do you trust those shadow creatures?"

Danny looked warily up past his console at something off-screen. "Mostly."

The thought made my stomach churn, but it was the only choice we had time for. "I need you to ask one to come here and enter my mind. I think I've been to Orthogonal Control before, and it might be able to recover some portion of my memories."

A mocking laugh reached my ears for a second time, and I looked around sharply. Was one of the shadow creatures already here?

"It heard you," Danny stated with concern.

The air darkened behind the Noahs, and they turned in surprise, sensing the creature's sudden arrival. Russell's eyes went wide.

*Hello.* The dark patch floated there awkwardly. I could tell it wasn't sure how to behave when it wasn't torturing or teasing. *Memories?*

"Yes," I said aloud, my heart pounding.

*The Great Barrier prevents me from entering your mind fully*, it whispered. *You will have to purposely let me consume you.*

"Consume me?" I shook my head. "Don't damage my mind."

It paused before agreeing. *Understood.*

I felt it poking around my awareness, and, against all animal instinct, I lowered my guard.

All my senses fell away as ice and shadow descended.

I stood among scrubs and snow in an endless arctic tundra. I'd wrapped a cloth around my face, but the cold was still biting and horrible against my exposed eyes. It was all I could do to press forward, especially with my weaker teenage body.

A nebulous ball of darkness floated alongside me as I pushed through the snow. *Let us look for those elements of your memory that stand out.*

"It's got to be later than this," I told it, manipulating my stolen chip to open a natural rift located somewhere above the snow. "I'm sneaking out of the First World for the first time because my parents are apathetic cowards and my neighborhood is full of terrified do-nothings. I don't wanna live forever. Not if it means I end up like *them.*"

The snow-filled tundra shook under my feet.

*Best hurry,* the shadow whispered. *Your physical modes of existence are disintegrating.*

I stepped through the rift, full of fear and hope at the incredible range of unknowns I would find out in the worlds at large.

I'd been walking and running for three days. I didn't know how much longer I could keep going. The Louisiana marshes had slowly begun turning into rolling hills as I fled north, but I was running out of willpower and strength. The gas creature on my heels moved at four miles an hour no matter what; never tiring, never slowing, never losing interest. This was how it hunted, and a fool sixteen year-old was no match for a predator like that. In that endless moment of my life, I understood what death and inevitability truly meant.

*Is it now?* the shadow asked, curiously probing my hazy recollection of the gas creature.

"No," I grunted. "I don't get out of this for another entire day, when a once-in-a-decade hurricane hits and erases my trail."

*Forward, then.*

Another rift opened ahead, and I slogged through it.

I was suddenly years older, and hungry. I'd tried the city life, but the streets had proven no place for a lone teenage girl. I'd stabbed a man for getting violently handsy, and been forced to run back to the Kansan plains where I could steal food from unsuspecting farmsteads. If I picked up too much heat from the local sheriff, I just moved on to the next reality. Same shit, different day.

But not that day. I hid among the high stalks of wheat, watching a group of soldiers stalking something unseen in the fields. Certain changes had come over me in the last two years, and, while hiding in that field, I found myself suddenly aware of my dirty fingernails, messy hair, and worn out clothes. Those soldiers, let me tell you - they were some hot stuff.

*I recommend against distraction.*

"Right," I said aloud, shaking off the surprisingly powerful influence of teenage hormones. "They're all gonna die, though. I've seen those un-purple-eyed things before, and they're great at laying traps. Call out in voices 'n shit." I crept forward to help, but another rift came up to meet me.

"You're like, the most badass chick I've ever met," Conn laughed, handing me another beer as we sat around the fire with his buddies. He was much younger than I was used to, and the image startled me. "Is there anything else around here we should watch out for?"

To the delighted laughter of his squadmates, I chugged his beer and crushed it in my hand in one breath. "Yup."

He grinned. "Like what?"

"Indigenous shit. Creatures, ghosts, entities, whatever was always here before."

"Before what?"

I shut my yap and just smiled drunkenly instead. Poor country hicks didn't know a damn thing about the way of the worlds. I'd left behind more wealth than they would ever see. Living on the fringe of societies, I'd also run into every horror and threat the various North Americas had to offer. Unlike most everyone else, I hadn't disappeared without a trace after any given run-in. I'd survived them all.

You know, it was kind of the perfect excuse to get this hot guy to come see me again. "You know, if you run into anything else weird, I'll still be around these parts for the season. Maybe drop by."

His grin faded into a subtle caring smile. "I will."

It was wonderful to relive those nearly-forgotten moments, but I stood up and walked into a purple rift among the wheat while they watched.

What was I, twenty by then? Twenty-one? "I'm fuckin' pregnant!" I shouted at him as we waded as fast as we could away from the marsh reavers. They pounded along behind, thumping and splashing as they swarmed after us through the murky waters of the Florida Everglades.

"You're *what?*" Conn shouted back, eyes wide.

I darted left into another rift.

A blackboard didn't really seem my style. My plain clothes fit oddly around my large belly, and I wasn't sure I would be a good teacher for a bunch of kids. I'd spent my younger years wandering around homeless and doing whatever the hell I wanted. What life skills could I possibly give to these children?

Still, it was a job, and it would pay the bills.

To my right, Conn from the swamps emerged from the same mental rift I'd just used. He looked around in confusion, first at my desk and blackboard, and then at my belly. "What's going on?"

*Now that's odd,* the shadow whispered in my ear.

Time was short. I couldn't delay. I got up and ran, turning a corner past a metal set of drawers and into another mental crack.

Little Laura plodded forward on stubby legs, taking her first real steps.

I sat beside Conn. I was happy, but brooding. "There's something I need to tell you about where I'm really from."

He looked back at me with confusion.

The Conn from the swamps appeared, having followed me again. He stared at the two of us, and then at Laura, and then at me. "Wait!"

I ran again.

My parents watched us with broad smiles. They were just happy that their daughter was finally home, even if it was only for a little while. Too, they got to see and hang out with their newly teenage grand-daughter. Laura had seemed ecstatic to meet her grandparents, and I was starting to think that coming back to visit might not be such a bad idea.

I stood alongside Conn as they prepared to slide him into the massive coffin-like machine that would forever lock him at his current age. "It's alright - I just did it myself. This is so we'll always be around for Laura."

He gripped my hand hard. "It still feels weird, but I'll do it. For her."

As he went in, a grey-haired man in a military uniform appeared at the end of the hallway. I hadn't known what he'd wanted, not then, but I didn't want to think about his job offer now. I wished I'd chosen another path. I wished I'd said no.

The Conn from the swamps darted in, and everyone stared at him in wonder. He wasted no time in continuing to chase me down through my first few years as a military consultant.

I took off into another rift. It was a hospital again, years later, but for a very different reason than before.

"Not this one," I said to my observing shadow, fighting back tears. "Not this one!"

The next rift came immediately, and I darted into church grounds full of destroyed and unearthed graves. It had been my decision to bury her out here where Conn and I worked, far from the First World, and something despicable had crept in and stolen her body and soul.

Fury was a meager description for what I felt.

The next rift brought me to a sea of desert sands.

Soldiers surrounded me. None were Conn. None mattered. They were all simply tools. That bastard abomination had to be destroyed, and nothing else held any weight for me. My life had always been one of bitter survival and battle. I told myself that this was no different. What else was there but rage and hate?

The Conn from the swamps ran out onto the sand. "Cristina! Stop!"

"I can't see this again," I told the shadow, burning with a thousand different painful emotions. "Further. Skip further!"

I stumbled out into forested wilderness. My back felt tight and odd from a dozen still-healing stab wounds. I'd set off on my own after recovering moderate health at the rebel camp, and now I was wandering the multiverse like I was sixteen again. So many years, so much happiness and pain. I'd lost Laura, I'd lost Conn, I'd lost everything. How had it come back to this?

Somewhere out there, Ward Shaw was leading the unholy remnants of our brigade in pursuit of mysteries I couldn't bring myself to care about. I'd had the vague goal of searching out information on the entities that had helped build the Shield, but leads had been sparse. It felt like I'd just been wandering in a grey fog of despair for years.

The forested landscape shivered, and I remembered that time was running out.

I sat on a rock, unable to go any further.

I brought out the faithful compass chip that had served me for so many years. How long had it even been? Everything had started to blur together. Two, three decades? I -

Pink electricity arced out from it, riding up my arm and hitting me in the face.

I'd instinctually noticed something wrong with the neighborhood for several days before my brooding focus lifted long enough for me to truly grow curious.

Standing and walking out from the porch where I'd been sitting, I approached three children that were huddled around some sort of object.

"What do you have there?"

Immediately, the children dropped their object of interest and bolted.

I scanned the street, but nobody else was around at this time of day. Their copy of the Tale of Two Cities sat on the sidewalk, flipping gently in the breeze.

I reached down to pick it up and dust it off, but I found that I already had something in my left hand. It was an odd device made of tubes, gears, and serrated blades that defied comprehension. Even as I stared, it transformed and moved up harmlessly around my forearm to free my hands. "I already had the book," I realized aloud, mind reeling. "*I already had the book when I tracked down Thomas.*" I'd thought I'd found it at random in that first other world, but it had already been with me, in that curious perception-altering way that it had. That meant"That was it! The timeskip! Go back!"

My lurking shadow companion reeled back the tape, and I found myself sitting on that rock in the wilderness again. Quiet and desperate winds flowed across my face as we entered the last hour of our existence.

What had I done, exactly? I'd messed with the chip, and then -

Pink electricity arced out from it, riding up my arm and hitting me in the face. This time, the shadow shot a dark limb forward and gripped my head. A screeching series of stabs pieced my memories back together.

A bubble of matter had come with me. A half-sphere of dirt, the accompanying air, the rock I'd been sitting on, and even parts of trees all plopped to the smooth and featureless pink surface that formed the ground. All around me, tremendous human-built structures towered into the empty cyan sky. "This is it"

*Do you have a way to determine its location?*

I stood and walked, following the path of my memories. I'd guessed what this place was, based on the childhood tale, and I walked in search of those lost repositories. There was no walking, per se, but movement by pure thought, and I came to numerous ancient vaults.

As I stood outside their massive grated entrances, thick clear rain began to fall. Something about this place, something about that chip, had sensed my absolute despair. Was it an accident that I had been brought here? Or was that part of the nature of a mode of existence built to offer a last resort?

I investigated much of the ancient junk in the vaults by reading their accompanying documents. The papers didn't contain text as much as they contained pure ideas. One of the devices that had been found out in the multiverse was a strange book that was supposed to have the capability to read souls it sat apart from the other tools and weapons, presented on a square pedestal, as if it had been left out for some unknown visitor. It would be very useful, I knew.

I took it and wandered further, finding a control station that monitored most of the worlds of man. The idea came to me as obvious, and I changed the scanning parameters.

There was one - just one - of the entities that had helped build the Shield. It had been permitted to portal inside thanks to the lingering privileged status of his people in the computers, and it now resided on the east coast of a specific North America.

It was what I'd been looking for the last five years. How had this happened? What had brought me here?

The Conn from the swamps burst around a corner and grabbed me by the arms. "Don't go. I have to tell you something!"

"What's that?" I asked, wholly confused.

He gaze into my eyes with concern. "I just wanted to say goodbye."

I nodded, not sure I understood. I was starting to cry, though I didn't know the reason. "Why? Why would you say that?"

"You have to go," he told me, looking up at the cyan sky warily. His gaze turned back to me. "Just remember that I love you."

My memories continued running like a reel of film, and he was gone.

I returned to that bubble of matter that I'd brought with me, and stood in the dirt. A surrounding circle of odd pink shapes formed a kind of portal device, and I willed it to send me where I needed to go.

The stabbing hit again as the shadow creature's efforts linked the end of my erased memories to my consciousness. The ice and darkness let me go.

I awoke to find myself still standing in that bunker, while shouts and coordinated efforts rang out.

"Cristina's awake," one of the Noahs announced.

Worlds away, Alek leaned close to his console. "Did you find it?"

"I was there," I told him, feeling strange. "Heath, has Conn checked in recently?"

"No, but he did say to tell you that something was done. He said you'd understand. I haven't heard from him since. He was on that world you visited, with the man in the bunker eleven thousand feet underground. He finally did it - all the nuclear bombs went off."

My lips parted to speak, but no words came out. I'd left that man there, on account of the billions of human lives on the surface of that world, and, in trade, only one life had been taken.

There in the middle of that bunker, I sat down.

I crossed my legs, like I'd often sat as a teenager, and put my head in my hands.

*I can sense it,* the shadow whispered. *I can't reach it or touch it, but I can sense it out there. It is an odd bump alongside your physical existence. I would never have noticed it before.*

Danny heard that over the comms. "Can you come here and help a brownshirt open a portal to it?"

*It may be possible.*

The chill in the air vanished as the shadow departed.

If I'd done anything differently, anything at all, Conn

Noah Two ignored the ongoing shouts and tremors and came to sit next to me. "You alright? It felt like you were on a pretty crazy rollercoaster."

I sent out a thought. *Ward, are you there?*

"Yes," he responded, his deep voice clear even in pure thought.

*How are Thomas and the kids doing?*

"Unknown."

*What do you mean?*

"You ordered me to lead them to a specific hill and then set off on my own, in case you died and I decided to exact revenge on them."

*I what?* Painful flame raced through my every vein. *I didn't order anything like that at all!*

That mocking laugh rang out in my ears again, louder this time. I looked up. "Noah, do you sense that? Is there someone else here?"

Danny's gleeful shout filled the bunker. "We've got it! We've got a portal to Orthogonal Control!" Beyond Noah Two, the monitor displayed a wide oval blue portal to a searing pink and cyan landscape.

Noah Two frowned. "Actually I do feel something"

A soldier and several brownshirts walked up to the portal and looked through. "What are those?"

I saw them first, and I realized, in a flash, what had happened. The Regret Demon had taken my shoe, analyzed the dirt on it, and traded valuable information away to a third party.

The distant cyan sky over Orthogonal Control was alive with dozens of ruby cubes. The pink landscape was crawling with gemstone life of all sorts.

They'd already sought refuge there.

"Close it!" I shouted, climbing back up on my feet. "Close the portal!"

Danny was confused, but gave the order. The portal closed a moment later.

I'd traded away my shoe without any idea what I was giving up. It could have been a refuge for humanity to escape the crisis.

I'd left that man there in that bunker, and he'd let those nuclear bombs go off, and Conn was gone

And I'd trusted Ward Shaw to watch over Thomas and the kids, and someone or something had tricked him and separated them. Where could they possibly be now? Had the grey floods taken them? Had they had to seek shelter on their own?

And my world, my parents - it was all gone. I'd saved most of the First World people by wrecking the whole planet, but I hadn't found my parents among the refugees.

What did I have left? Why was I even doing any of this? I'd come here expecting to die, but hoping for a good way to go out.

What was left to save?

There were almost a trillion human beings out there, sure, but I didn't know any of them personally. Danny could go with the brownshirts, and the rest of humanity be damned

Noah Two gripped my shoulder.

Alek's voice filled the bunker. "The rise in pressure on the Shield it's accelerating!"

"How is that possible?" Danny asked, terrified as he looked at the data. "Our backup shields are overlapping properly."

Russell had the answer. "Something - this Crushing Fist - it's responding to our actions! It's only pressing down harder!"

One of the Noahs on the monitors began to shout something, but a tremendous shaking and flash blanked out his screen.

The signal went out.

"Holy shit," Danny screamed, eyes wide. "The generator at Amber Eight just exploded - looks like the whole planet ruptured in half -" He trailed off, not believing his own eyes.

"Something's here," Noah Two whispered. "It's watching, and it's amused."

Alek kept working his controls. "We have to keep going. This'll still work with just nine generators."

The sound of falling water began splattering down beyond the elevator doors behind us. I knew what that meant - with the expansion of Amber One's shield, the grey waters had begun pouring into the world above. I pulled away from Noah Two and faced Russell. "You should probably go. Thanks for your help. Get your family out of here."

He nodded worriedly, but did not hesitate. The elevator doors spilled out a wash of grey liquid, and he took the elevator up while he still had the chance.

Why was I still here? I had every right to run for it. I could just head off into the multiverse, and to hell with all this. I'd lost *everything*, and had nothing left to protect or fight for.

The two monitors to my left showed the pressure and distortions rising rapidly. Something out there was responding to our attempts to generate more Shielding I moved one of the Noahs and sat down to man the controls myself.

A shout from Amber Four's feed made us all look up just as fire filled the screen.

The feed went dark.

"Amber Four just exploded," Danny breathed. "*The whole planet's gone!*"

**Two down, eight to go.**

The three Noahs and I looked around our bunker in angry confusion.

"Who was that?" Alek yelled at us. "Is there someone there with you?"

Grey water reached my feet and began pooling underneath my chair. Rising tremors made the computer screens flicker.

**It's been so much fun watching you,** the deep and mocking voice continued. **This is always my favorite part.**

If I was anything, I was spite incarnate. I'd had no reason to stay before, but knowing that someone or something was taking glee at our destruction - to hell with them. To hell with existence. Conn had saved Laura's body and soul, and that meant I had no more reason to hold back. "Everyone get out."

The team's shouts stopped. Silence fell. The only sound was the noise of rushing waters seeping into each of our bunkers.

Danny gulped. "What?"

"Get out," I told them calmly and fiercely. "Find safety. Heath and I will figure this out."

"We will?" Heath chimed in, worried.

"You can patch my controls through to all the stations, can't you?" I asked.

"Yes"

"Then do it. Everyone else - get the hell out." They looked scared, so I reiterated my order. "*GO!*"

	<TEXT> Right now I can't discuss more than what's literally written as character knowledge, but Ward Shaw talked about the destruction of a great number of realities which was (probably) by that gigantic multiverse entity, and then he also found that, for some unknown reason, pressure on the Shield after barely surviving that hit was continuing to rise. That conversation occurred about six months after the hit. He knows that gigantic entity doesn't think or care about us, and if it did it would obliterate us instantly - whatever the current problem or attack is, it's unrelated. Many characters have their own guesses and theories, but nobody knows for sure what the Crushing Fist really is. 

The shadow creatures came from the new emptiness where the destroyed realities used to be, and they certainly presented as vicious and mocking threats trying to get in, so Danny's personal guess was that they were somehow responsible. These facts should all be out there, and there's some more about that as well in the new Chapters 4-6 of Alek's story in the Moon Aflame, which is coming out in the next few days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If they have self preservation, then shouldn't they have cared that they were being buried? Or was it that they realized there was no way out? Or just that they fully understood his point and agreed?

On these three points: he cares he's being buried, but he realizes there's no way out. There's no point in crying or screaming over it, because that would just be an act, and because he knows the speaker isn't going to fall for it at all. And he also understands why the speaker is burying him, and empathizes in the inhuman way they both share, so he can't really blame him. </TEXT>
