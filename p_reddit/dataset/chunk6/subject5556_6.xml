	<TEXT> Pasting the top comment on Hacker News about it, from a user named "abalone":

What's really interesting about this is not just that Lattner is brilliant and liked, but that is highlights just how critical *software correctness and reliability* is to autonomous vehicles. Naively one might have expected some machine learning expert to take over the reins at Tesla. But fast-moving Silicon Valley needs a fundamental shift in quality standards when it comes to safety-critical software, and if you look closely, Lattner has been leading this charge at the language and compiler level.

His work has been distinguished by the melding of language *safety, reliability and clarity,* that is, not merely having sophisticated constructs that help the guarantee correctness, but also making code simple, beautiful and easy to read. Ultimately writing safe code depends on the ability of the programmer to comprehend it, so creating a programming environment that's successful on all fronts is a foundational achievement.

A notable example: LLVM enabled ARC, a beautifully simple approach to memory management that removed much (not all) of the need for the developer to implement details in code, while providing high efficiency and, perhaps even more importantly, predictable performance (no garbage collection pauses). These are all essential for safety-critical realtime software.

	<TEXT> But actually the main point of that article is that failure tests a person and strengthens them if they choose to learn from it, and *that* leads them to success, as long as they keep trying and learning, and trying more and learning more, until they reach that success.

3 Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes:

Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.

Training gives us an outlet for suppressed energies created by stress and thus tones the spirit just as exercise conditions the body.

The resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character.

Winners know when to quit: when they win. ;)

I doubt, however, that Ronda Rousey will fight another UFC match. She's already begun an acting career as it is. 

And I really wonder about Facebook's future:

	<TEXT> Here is an interesting list of 15 facts about the number 2017. One fact that I found particularly compelling is that "The sum of all odd primes up to 2017 is a prime number, i.e. 3+5+7+11+...+2017 is a prime number. " I saw the link to this on the computer programmer forum Hacker News, and I have linked to that below as well.

	<TEXT> If you enjoy it, do it. Most people really seem to second-guess themselves and stand hold themselves back, for no good reason. It's about doing what you enjoy, in the mere percentage of time you have that is not spent sleeping, eating, driving, shopping, washing up, waiting for things, and so on. If the only people permitted to pursue careers in thew field were school teachers and professors, and Fields Medal competitors, there wouldn't be much advancement--or enjoyment--of what math is, and it is nothing without people engaging in the study and practice of it.

	<TEXT> I think that loneliness has been shown to cause OCD as well. All the time alone causes some people's mind to get more and more neurotic, with no other person or circumstances around to stop or control the development of that type of thinking and behavior. Furthermore, I've seen how people with OCD hae gotten even worse in solitude, while others (or the same people) have gotten better when they live with others.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It seems to me that people in general are obsessed with forming social connections.

I think you mean that in the context of social-media "connections" or "friends" (be it on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, even LinkedIn, or wherever), and the emotional pain or unhappiness that comes from wanting more such "friends" and more online attention. Obsessive real-life friend-searchers are extremely few, at least in America; friendships don't form so quickly. You cab quickly have a lot of peers and co-members, like if you're a college student who just joined a fraternity, but is every other member a friend in the standard sense? 

 there are a lot of initiatives to help people who struggle with loneliness but I know of not a single one that helps people who crave solitude but can't get it.

What kind of initiative are there for people who have general loneliness? And, conversely, what type of initiative could there be to help someone who craves solitude by can't get it? If I'm currently unable to move out of my parents' house and have 8 siblings, what could there be for me? Or if I'm unable to move out of this small apartment where I have 6 roommates, what could help me? A cash-raising initiative to help me move out? GoFundMe? :)

	<TEXT> I went through the American public-school system in New York state and never even heard the name "Uzbekistan" once, from kindergarten all the way to my senior year of college. We learn absolutely nothing about those countries, whether you're talking about Kazakhstan or Mongolia or whatever. Virtually no America could locate the countries on a blank world map. I lived in New York City and no one I know would know anything whatsoever about Uzbekistan. I could say it's an area in Afghanistan, or located directly above India. No one would know. 

Even American news completely ignores most of the world all year round. Meanwhile, I see that Obama and/or Trump are on the front page of foreign newspapers every week. Here are today's newspapers (scroll down to the last third of the page for the non-American papers) -

	<TEXT> I don't think it's for show; I think it's definitely a very real expression of competitiveness in the context of an upcoming match. HE not going to be talking to trash to people who have nothing to do with the sport. I mean, let's say he were alone at your restaurant and no one else was around, and you came up to him, introduced yourself as an MMA fan (or fighter) and volunteered some negative critiques of his abilities; I think that regardless of no audience being there, that he'd have some choice words. When his teammates were being taunted by Conor McGregor, he actually got up and shoved McGregor, which I think even his teammates all thought was an insane (and perhaps insanely stupid) move here for various reasons (beginning of this video) -

	<TEXT> So many great athletes, perhaps even most, are boastful and mocking, but another way to view it is as being brash (or grandstanding) and silly (or poking fun at the competitor). Of course in the NFL, NBA, NHL, and so on, virtually all of the trash-talking and shows of disdain are not heard by the live audience or TV audience, but I think that purely humble and deferential pro athletes are few and far between. And in combat sports, the best have done notorious amounts of boasting and mocking in and out of the ring: Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and Conor McGregor. Ronda Rousey too, until last year.
