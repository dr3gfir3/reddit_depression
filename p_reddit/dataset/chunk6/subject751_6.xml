	<TEXT> It reminds me of that [spinning dancer's silhouette](http://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/2n70o7/spinning_dancer_illusion/) optical illusion; some see her spinning one way, and others see her spinning the opposite way. However, if you look at it long enough you can change the way she is spinning and after a while you can do it pretty much freely. </TEXT>
