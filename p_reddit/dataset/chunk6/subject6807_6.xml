	<TEXT> A few films that comes to mind is Welcome to the Dollhouse, True Grit and the Potter franchise.

I may be wrong about some of those, didn't actually look up the actors age.

Anyway, I get why they mostly don't do it for stuff with a predominant cast of high school kids. Makes everything a lot more difficult and complex. It's like that old saying about water, kids and animals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People can watch movies however they want, but I don't think there's any doubt that many stories does not work as well if you already know either the entire story or parts beforehand. 

It's like knowing the punchline to a joke. Of course you can still enjoy it if it's well told, but never in the same way as you would have if you went in blind.

I watched Split recently. Someone in this sub had spoiled it for me. Not to be malicious, at least I don't think so, but they probably thought it didn't matter.

I can say with certainty that it would have been one of the best surprises of my entire movie going life if I hadn't known what I was told. It was still a good film, I enjoyed it, but it didn't kick me like it would have if I didn't knew where it was going.

Another example is the movie Green Room. saw it without knowing anything, checked the trailers afterwards, and if I had seen those it would have fundamentally changed my experience.

There is only one time you can experience something for the first time, but you can always rewatch, so I certainly don't seek out spoilers on purpose. I stay away from most trailers and plenty of pther marketing material as well. 

If I want that different experience knowing what's coming, I just see a film again. </TEXT>

I don't know about any of that, but I certainly felt it's used very well to tell a dramatic engaging story in both Bates Motel, Split and of course Psycho. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't automatically hate reboots, remakes or sequels, but I'm not sure I see the financial point of this.

I don't imagine kids today are waiting with bated breath for the sequel to a film they have likely never heard of.

But hey, I don't care if it's a flop as long as it's good. And if it's not, it'll just disappear like all other lousy attempts to continue older films.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I mean Banshee got weekly recaps on the AV Club and I'm pretty sure The Knick did too.

That's true, but apparently Quarry wasn't classy enough. Doesn't make since Banshee is way more pulpy and trashy (in a great way). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Can you convince me?

Not really. It just isn't a show that's going to appeal to everyone because it doesn't focus much on the things others of its kind does. It's about emotions and it shifts between genres all the time, sometimes it goes straight farce, the overall plot is secondary and it slows down all the time. It's a big messy colorful crazy thing.

But it certainly is positive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want something exactly like Banshee you won't like it much. 

I would say two episodes is enough to say it's not for you. 

Seems like they kind of sold it as a new Banshee. Terrible idea. </TEXT>
