	<TEXT> I recently asked r/whatsthisthing about a spider in my carport that looked deadly. Turns out it's a nice guy and maybe it's reducing the amount of mosquitos around my front porch. 

I also subscribe to r/fanfiction and I'm about to post a chapter on a work that I havent updated in a year. I have a tendency to not complete things, so I think it's a personal goal of mine to see this story through! And reading everyone's comments about posting, getting reviews and feedback inspires me to dust that work off and complete it.  </TEXT>

edit: I've heard You by Caroline Kepnes is going to be a showtime series. I'd read that. The protagonist is a stalker who is pretty haughty (and oddly likable) and has more personality than the girls he targets/likes. It's pretty updated and fresh writing!

	<TEXT> I really loved Edward Hermann's narration of Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand. I felt like I was listening to it live on the radio. 

I recently listened to Swamplandia and SO MANY people hated the narrator who represented Ava. She just sounded so dissociated and bored by the story she was telling. 

I'm currently listening to Klostermann's But What if We're Wrong. And I'd much rather listen to him narrate his own book. But it's this British chick and she's very distracting. 

When the narrator benefits the book, it's wonderful! I really like comedians narrating their own book (like Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Aziz, etc). The audiobook becomes a different experience.

But watching it when you're going through pre-puberty and thinking Tom Cruise was kinda hot but then also not quite realizing why you wanted Darkness and Lily to just try it out for awhile bc they could make it work and then fine I'll do it I'll fix myself I'll just write my own version

	<TEXT> Wasn't a huge fan of the book. I was hoping the movie would be better than the book. (I'm also a huge fan of Eva Green!)

SPOILERS: 

The book starts off great but there's something off about it. I'm trying to figure out what it is exactly, but maybe the book is very adjective heavy or over descriptive when it didnt need to be. And I found myself getting bored while reading the book.  

In the book, the main girl Emma has power over fire. So they changed that for the movie. Plus, Emma really dug the main character's grandfather. But she doesnt age. So they didnt want it to be weird that she's the love interest of the grandfather (when he was younger) and the main guy at the current stage of the story.  I have heard the movie played down Emma and the grandfather's relationship they had in the book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sex does not sell books. Even with romance novels, the key ingredient of a blockbuster book isnt hanky-panky but what the authors call human closeness: the everyday meaningful interactions between human beings that make up a good chunk of every best-seller in every genre. The hugs, the friendly banter and the I love yous are the glue that holds together the murders, car chases and sex scenes of a page-turners plot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **But What if We're Wrong, by Chuck Klosterman, narrated by  Fiona Hardingham**

I loved the other Chuck Klosterman books I've read, but this one is miserable to get through on audiobook. Chuck read the opening and everything was great. Then this chick took over and I dont know if it's her or what, but I feel like she's not delivering the already complicated concepts he's putting out there in an understandable way. Maybe her cadence is off, I dont know. But I hardly know what's happening. There is a lot of "mabye this is true, but maybe the opposite is true" and I have no clue what the book is trying to focus on. Not sure if it's the audiobook format or Klosterman's actual writing. Very frustrating. 

**Before the Fall, by Noah Hawley**

This book is really good so far! A private plane goes down in the water and the only people who come out alive are a painter and the 4 year old kid of some mega-rich, media mogul. This book deals with the post-crash pieces that have to get picked up by the painter (ie. how to handle the "fame", what actually happened? why did he live?). I've heard people are disappointed by the ending. But I'm really digging the book so far. The writer wrote for Bones and Fargo (the tv series).

	<TEXT> I dont have any suggestions but I herniated an L4 disc in the beginning of Jan. And I just walked and stayed out of the gym. I had a drop foot (like my nerve was messed up and I couldnt flex my foot!). It was very traumatic, not gonna lie. (I also gained like 20 lbs so dont do that!). 

But now might not be a great time to focus on yoga, Maybe it's a time or a "season" to foster other habits. Maybe read more, maybe work on culinary skills, etc. 

Ask the doctors what you *can* do. Maybe they want you to strengthen your core? Maybe you walk. Maybe you swim. I took a restorative yoga class a few times. 

It sucked for me, bc I had a lot of social life going on at the gym. Plus I teach yoga ... and I had to teach by cueing only (which I can do, thank god) and the people I work for were really nice about it and so were the regulars. 

Don't force the issue in a yoga class. I know not all instructors are doctors and they can't know all the nuances of injury.  Forward folds happen with so many poses. Even transitioning from standing to plank is a forward fold. I dont know how you could omit forward folding in most hatha or power yoga classes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I teach at a university. And it's, more often than not, one of the student's first introductions to yoga, so I keep all that stuff light. I focus on them being physically still and just "seeing what happens" when they close their eyes in savasana. I'll close with namaste and say what it means. I'll give them a little bit of guidance, but I try not to talk too much or get into chakras, meditation, etc. I dont om or chant in sanskrit. I mainly call the poses by their american version and then throw in the sanskrit name every now and then. 

But sometimes in tree, I might say something like "where do you need balance in your life?" Or I'll say something generically that might come across as "deep". My focus in teaching beginners is: getting them to engage muscles they'd otherwise ignore, teaching them how to be still, encouraging body awareness, breathing deeper than just the space of their ribs, and just relaxing and stretching them out. I'm fixing planks and having people watch their ego and come out of upward facing dog and hold cobras ... 

I think it really depends on your knowledge and where you teach. If you're teaching more of a fitness class, I'd stay away from getting too deep into the spiritual aspect of it. A guy in my class came up and said the namaste part made him uncomfortable. I've never seen him again! It was just one guy, and I'm glad it's not a trend with the class I teach! 

I know I'm not a "studio" instructor. I really do love teaching beginners. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just scrolled to this comment, but definitely agree. 

For me, I had a pretty good front squat and weak back squat. I herniated my L4. A few people (2 chiros and my neurosurgeon) say that it's probably due to strong anterior and weak posterior. So Im lowering my weights and working on my posterior to decrease the chance of it happening again. :/ 

edit: i was told by one of the chiros the strong anterior, weak posterior/"quad dominant" is classic crossfitter and helps keep him in business.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had to take an Uber home yesterday bc of drinking things. Someone had given me a bag (for me to puke in). And so the car moves and I am like - oh god i feel horrible. And so I puke in the bag. But the bag had no bottom! And so I puke in this guys car. And I wake up to a $75 cleaning fee in addition to my $23 Uber. 

Who gives someone a bag to puke in with no bottom?! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Night Film by Marisha Pessl isnt very prose-y but I did like the idea of the novel. A secretive, director's beautiful daughter commits suicide and a disgraced journalist looks into the whole matter. Loved it! 

I've heard good things about Broken Monsters by Lauren Beukes but I have yet to read it. Kept getting compared to True Detective Season 1 so that's why I have it on my to-read list still. 

Ann Rice has a Mayfair Witches series. 

Deborah Harkness has her All Souls Trilogy (again, witches)

It's just two dudes saying "man" and covering their mouth and trying not to laugh a lot. It's probably horrible and it had no business being in that story.

I also wonder how many coaches out there have liability insurance. Sometimes the waiver really only protects the gym, not the individual coaches. And we're in a litigious society so .... if I was a coach at a crossfit gym, I'd read the waiver and see if youre protected against a lawsuit. You never know who's going to walk into a gym....  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I havent updated my fic coming up on a year now. I have an outline. I know how the story will mostly end. I just stopped writing bc of exercise, work, and teaching yoga. So I had to basically re-read my work. I feel like such an ass because the 70 or so followers are going to get some email about my story being updated. And it's going to be a crap chapter. 

But after reading the work, I found the old file that had the chapter. I had to rewrite it and edit a lot out because it was just filler and not going anywhere. I pushed up an "exciting" scene just to make the chapter worth it to the readers. And now I think I need about two more days of editing it and filling it with more content (its only about 2k words :/ but I write shorter chapters and the length is honestly in line with what i've already posted). The tv show is about to start, so I should get to posting and get pre-premier view bump. 

This chapter is all buildup still. I feel like once my story climaxes, the end will come shortly after. The story focuses on a small ship in a big fandom. And it's a slow burn that fizzles. But I want it to fit in with the canon and make sense. Like it *could* have happened on the show. And I'm not sure if I should just add some more sexiness or keep it more in line to what the characters would actually do when put in a perilous situation? I'm leaning towards the latter. 

Obviously I needed to get this off my chest! I'm glad I FINALLY started focusing on my fanfic again. I just need to write more bc I'm so rusty.  </TEXT>

A Scoutmaster and his troop (kids with diff personalities so you dont mix them up! that's always nice when they're not carbon copies) ... they go onto an isolated island when a mysterious, ill stranger falls upon their campsite. 

It's no Shakespeare but it's fun. I cringed a few times listening to it because things got squirmy and gross.

All I can say is because your body has more options to get into, you have a higher chance of getting into an injurious position. And most people dont have the option to get into positions that might cause harm because their joints just dont move that way or they're so inflexible or muscle-bound, they don't have full ROM in the first place. 

A lot of the cues we give are "dont lock your knee/elbow" or "slight bend in the knee/elbow" ... but that really only helps so far. Especially when you have heavy weights overhead you're trying to "lock out".

I'm always curious of writers' writing processes. Do you have any daily routines that you do when you're writing? I work 9-5 so my day is pretty laid out. I'm wondering if you have a specific location you go to to write, do you turn off social media, do you listen to music, do you aim to write so and so many words a day? etc. 
Thank you!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have two pretty substantial stories in mind. 

1. The Walking Dead - it's the dreaded one where Rick wakes up and "it was all just a dream". So he's walking around with a huge mistrust of Shane. He sees Shane whispering with his wife (but like nothing has happened between them). And Rick is just edgy, but then life starts to go on. Then one day, he pulls over Maggie for speeding. Then he goes and finds Daryl ... Daryl is like WHO R U. Rick is flipping his shit and people are like - you need to chill. Then he settles down again. Third part is when he actually sees a walker. That basically starts the conclusion. And I cant spoil the ending. 

2. The Vampire Diaries - this is actually an original fic I want to write but I'm doing an AU, I guess, to put out the story. Caroline and Elena (or Bonnie I havent decided yet) are not vampires or witches. But they go on a retreat, no cellphones, no internet, no wifi. Turns out this retreat is REAL rugged. They go on hikes, sweat lodges, meditation things, etc. Then the girls find out they can't escape and theyre trapped! I gotta plot this one out a bit ....  </TEXT>

And I know that's in no way what you're going through ... but even that innocuous suggestion started to sway me and my resolve on my plot a little bit! 

I always think that you - the writer - KNOW the bigger picture. And if all things come to a good conclusion (and that doesnt necessarily mean a happy ending) and the story mechanics work out, I call that a success. And you're doing this for you, so continue on. And if you're crossing into bad taste? I think that's something you would only know because you know where the story is going.  </TEXT>

Just started this one so I'm not sure on the thematic direction of the book. however, I like the concept considering the time period we're currently  in - of blog posts and misinformation that quickly spreads around. This book will probably be "bigger picture". Anyways, I really enjoyed another Klosterman book I read (think it was sex drugs and cocoa puffs?) so I'm excited I'm already enjoying this one as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They each have their pros!

Audiobooks - great while commuting, but they can put me to sleep if I'm at my house. they can also add more personality to the book with a good narrator. audiobooks read by the author are really special. 

ebooks - my preferred reading at night (which is when I do most of my reading) bc i don't have to mess with any lights and the e-ink is easy on my eyes in a dark room. I can also take a hundred books around in my purse. 

I don't have to go anywhere for my ebooks  or audiobooks. I can just download them 

print - I mainly consume my library books this way! The library has got me back into reading paper books again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes I forget how much the tv shows "lock in" the imagery of a book for me. Once you see Maisie Williams as Arya, that is what Arya looks like. The Iron Throne looks like the tv show version (and what ends up on top of people's cakes, etc) ... the one in the link looks a lot grander than what we see! 

I remember another article talking about the scale of the Game of Thrones dragons, and I thought that was fun too. 

edit: From the article

Oh, no. Thats totally not right; thats sort of what HBO did, Groell recalled Martin saying of an early effort by Tammy Patterson. Mine is much bigger and more tangled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed! This is over-generalizing, but my ff.net reviewers tend to be: younger, foreigners (or English is not their first language. I have one girl who straight up comments in Portuguese). And the ao3 people tend to write more in depth, "deeper" reviews (so I assume they're older) but they seem less "fangirl"ish. 

I write m/f pairings (but that's usually a side story, I have other stuff going on). They seem to have a better reception on ff.net. I also don't write smut. And I seem to hear a lot of slash writers do very well on ao3 on this subreddit. But meanwhile I'm just not seeing the same feedback from ao3 (if I get reviews in the first place on ao3). I have maybe 1500 views on ao3 and then like 17k on ff.net for the same story. :/ 

edit:  I have some one-shots that did okay on ao3 compared to ff.net. But it's definitely for a smaller fandom, so I assume it's just fandom related.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, fun read! 

 Earlier this year, there was a round of excited editorials about how print is back, baby after industry reports showed print sales increasing for the second consecutive year. However, the growth was driven almost entirely by non-fiction sales more specifically adult coloring books and YouTube celebrity memoirs. As great as adult coloring books may be, their sales figures tell us nothing about the sales of, say, literary fiction.

I had no clue print sales were increasing ... and I had no clue it was because of coloring books. But I can't say I'm surprised! Out of my circle of friends, I know 3 that have bought their first book in years ... annnnnd it was a coloring book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World, by Andrea Wulf**

Just started this one. Only about two chapters in. But apparently this guy was a friend of Goethe's and an inspiration to Darwin. He pioneered the concept of the "interconnectedness" of nature. Written in laymen's terms so far. I like that bc I don't get overwhelmed! She's good about explaining the prevalent thought at the time, so I really get an understanding of the impact of the Humboldt's concepts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont really read a book for the ending. I read it for the journey it takes me on. So when a book ends with the main character dying or living or getting the girl or not getting the girl ... the way the author chooses to end the book (for the most part) will not affect the way I feel about the whole book. 

I hear people go, "I liked the book and then I got to the ending, and I HATED the ending, therefore I hate the book ...." If you enjoyed the book until the end, does that invalidate the remainder of the book? 

I think I would have enjoyed Rosie Project whether or not he got the girl. I was already invested with the characters by the end, ya know?  </TEXT>

When you're in the actual process of writing, do you have a pretty specific ritual? I work 9-5 at an office, so I know where I'll be and my day is pretty structured. I am always curious how artists and writers manage their time! Do you do social media at a certain time? Do you turn off the internet so you're not distracted? Do you write so and so many words a day or just stop when you feel like it? Do you always have music or coffee at your work station??

1. Audiobook for my commute (currently: Swamplandia)
2. Longer, serious read - this is a book that I read to better myself but it's typically not the first I would grab from a pile. classic, nonfiction, critically received book, etc. (Currently: Invention of Nature - a book about Alexander Humboldt)
3. Fluff piece or whatever else I have from the library. Best sellers, typically.  (Currently: Fates and Furies - library)

And I know a guy who works in comic books so whatever he decides to get me! Is that like half a book? Paper Girls, Swamp Thing, The Alcoholic, The Crow .... If you can, you should know a comic book guy! 

edit: And I like having the option of 2 books to read when I'm not going the audiobook route. Typically they're different enough that I have a preference for one or the other. I dont have problems picking books back up after not having reading them for a week.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my fandom's show is premiering soon. I havent updated this goddamn fic in over a year. But I see the views spiking (bc its Walking Dead, a big fandom). 

2 days ago: I did a BIG edit and got the idea of my next chapter. 

Last night: I filled in the holes

today and probably another day: I'll need to make it presentable ... I still have a huge chunk of something missing so I'll need to write more or edit something out. 


BIG BREATH. 

Its such a fucking dumb filler chapter but I can see cute stuff in there that people will want to read. And I love where the story is going and how it's all going to tie together, so I gotta do this.  And the other part of me would like to get back into updating this work frequently bc the show is starting again and the timing is right ...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's something like that ... I typically will put what episode I started writing the fic in the summary. This helps put things into context for most people. I was writing a Walking Dead and they killed off my character. So in the summary, I have that the events of my fic took place before so and so season. 

I'd also like to mention that if a show goes in a different direction than what most reasonable people would expect, fans of the show got hooked on the show (or series or whatever) before the "big change". So I would not change the direction of the original fic personally. Maybe you have a nostalgic fandom ... pining for the world before the writers of the show derailed the universe.  </TEXT>

Because I will either copy what's already out there (bc I'll be like ... well my fic isnt like these fics AT ALL and I start getting nervous - insert raven simone chewing gum gif) or I'll think it's not up to par or I'll see they have more comments and followers and I get wrapped up in things that really have zero effect on my story. So I think it's best just to be me going into my WIPs. 

edit: and the person who "reamed" me was actually really respectful! And I realize that my original comment came across like fanfic writers arent very good and I would rather read "real" books.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you tag your work with "major character death"? I feel like that's so spoiler-y ... especially if it happens later in the fic. Because you're probably going to focus on the person about to die for most of the fic ... and then the reader will know who is prob going to die.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! It definitely does for me. 

The more visibility you have, it's like you have more responsibility to not be a dick or post what may be considered offensive things ... It kind of white-washes what I want to write. You're just open to so much more criticism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I like that ROMWOD can be done with (almost) zero equipment and (personally) wouldn't keep up with a program that required much

That's really the nice thing about romwod! I feel like I'm more likely to do it at my house. I just need a little bit of floor space and maybe a towel and I'm g2g. 

You're not supposed to do it right after a workout, so I'm less likely to be at a gym where I'd have time to do the romwod (and the open space and mats at my gym are more conducive to handstands etc). So I like to do it around lunch time or in the morning. If I have shorts, I'll change into them at work and do the romwod in my office (door shut, obv).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a yogi friend (female) that diligently stretched about 4-5 days a week and got into splits in 2-3 months (right leg, not the left one). After she "got it", she stopped doing the stretches and lost it quickly after! She was like 28 at the time. 

I know a guy that can just get into them and I don't know of him actively working on this stretch ever. Past martial artist, he's in his 40s. 

Everyone else I know just shows off in a "look what I can do" way but I don't know anyone currently working towards this goal. 

Romwod will not get you into splits. You can look at stretches for splits on youtube and practice a few times a week if that's your goal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I teach yoga. And I do the romwods. You wont be able to get into the splits, but romwod (as I see the workouts now) could help definitely help out most people's hamstrings and ankle ROM quite a bit.  

I personally think he overemphasizes the back part of the body. It'd be nice to have more poses to open the front of the body. Even work on the wrists and such, maybe some twists ... But that's just me.  I wouldnt want to see handstands and the show-off yoga poses bc then it's skill work and you're not really working on your ROM so much anymore. 

RANT: My BIGGEST gripe is that he has blocks and everything there, but the 2 or 3 people doing the pose are all doing the same thing. I tweeted at the romwod people (and they're good with social media and responsive) but I got back a "We're working on it".  I just don't understand why they can't SHOW all levels of the pose! Especially if he's already verbalizing it. There's got to be some musclebound dudes that cant sit on their heels all that easily. And I just know from teaching yoga that if you say people can do a modification but they don't visually see the modification, then no one will do the modification. "Use a block". I have never seen anyone use the block. What does that mean? You have the block there, and no one is using it. It's a prop at this point. And I'm sure more people would buy the fucking "romwod(TM) block" if someone actually touched it during the romwod. 

That's obv a pet peeve of mine! Rant over. 

At the end of the day, it's what? $13 a month? Less than what I spend on coffee a week. I don't think it's bad for a daily chill yoga practice. The little stretches do add up. 

From my personal experience with yoga, I know a 50 year old woman just wanted to be able to hug her knees into her chest (she couldnt do that) and after a year of yoga, she pulled me aside and showed me that she could finally hug her knees into her chest. It was a very powerful moment to her. 

Whether or not ROMWOD will show you "gainz" in your flexibility or not really depends on your current flexibility. If you try it out, I'd  suggest doing it no less than 3x a week. I do romwod and yoga and it just really helps me with my back. I tend to wake up with a stiff back.  </TEXT>
