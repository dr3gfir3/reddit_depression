	<TEXT> Title says it. First thing that happened was that I couldn't start the game because it crashed on launch, fixed that by running steam in admin mode. Then after 2-3 minutes of the game launching, it crashes. Only message I get is that. Can barely get through the cutscene. :(

Here's my setup: http://i.imgur.com/ZLg4Wgl.png

	<TEXT> That could easily be explained though, just let Columbia be hinted at through a after credit scene then let the third and final movie explain the rifts and the connection with the cities with the Luteces or something </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that, the most perfect way they could introduce this franchise to movie watchers would be adapting the novel. The first movie could be a straight adaptation of the book and show how the world of Rapture works, all the goods and bads, how it came to be. The second movie could focus more on the aftermath of the fall. The first movie could focus more on the bright possibilities that  Rapture presents, and what it would mean in the long run. While the second movie could show the more, dark version that we see in the games. A lost and destroyed underwater city with crazy people killing eachother. A perfect adaptation for that one would be following the story of [Mark Meltzer](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Mark_Meltzer), and the movie could end with him being a big daddy walking around with his daughter in the dark and gritty rapture. Basically a dark ending, with a after credits easter egg which could show Columbia through one of the rifts throughout the city and hype everything up for a third and final movie. How that one would be adapted I have no idea.. Perhaps a straight adaptation could work with that one in some way since Booker is the first protagonist to actually SPEAK.. I do have some casting ideas for the movies though.

	<TEXT> I don't think basing a movie from the game would be smart, at all. Being a silent OP protagonist only works in the game franchise tbh. Although, the book "Bioshock Rapture" would be PERFECT, and I mean PERFECT, for a movie if it was done right. I remember reading it and just imagining scenes that could be in the movie. It could introduce all or most of the characters from rapture and just show how it all started since we only get to read about it or see a fraction of it from short cutscenes or dlc's. Then after that, the second movie could pick up after the fall of rapture, with a guy looking for his daughter in rapture.

Also when I read the book each time I read about Andrew Ryan or Sofia lamb I always pictured Benedict Cumberbatch as Ryan and Cate Blanchett as Sofia Lamb. Both are great actors and I seriously think they could pull of those characters perfectly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finished the series a couple of months ago for the 3rd or the 4th time, and I also wanted a movie set in this universe. Although I think if a movie ever got made they should do the same thing they're doing with the AC movie. Don't base it off the characters from the game but have a own story with characters made for the movie.

I remember in Bioshock 2 there was audiofiles you could pick up and listen to, specifically the guy who went down into rapture to find his little girl. I think that if they made a movie, it should have a similiar arch as that character. Make the movie have a dark tone, follow a character that has lost his daughter. Let the story have the same fate as the one in the games, aka, being turned into a big daddy to finally be with his little girl. The next movies could either follow the same characters or introduce more, and somehow bring in the connection between Rapture and Columbia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the movie suffered allot by having too much story in it. The movie felt like it randomly changed halfway, like after the peter/harry fight there must've been a huge time gap between then and the end since Harry's injuries are literally completely healed up. Same could've been said about Venom in the movie, if they had shown Eddie and what Peter did to him in the 3rd movie and then continue with the church scene in the 4th movie it would've made a much bigger impact. And the fact that Harry joins Peter so fast after a little chat with the butler annoys me. The entire movie should've been split up into 2 parts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats why I **bolded** the word *finest*, Tywin wouldn't get the blacksmith that may risk destroying the sword. He would get the best one he could find which happened to be the one from Volantis. Sure it would be the easiest/cheapest but Tywin wouldn't choose that. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [EVERYTHING] Gendry knows how to re-work Valyrian steel. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-11 15:29:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For a little while I've come up with this theory about Gendry, and that he might be able to re-work Valyrian steel. I don't have any proof that says "Gendry just knows how" but I figured out a couple of things that could perhaps prove it.

First off, in [Season 4 Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCItXEFnen0) we see Tywin Lannister reforging Ned Starks sword Ice. Which is made into the swords Oathkeeper and Hearteater/Widows Wail. In the episode Jaime says "No ones made a Valyrian steel sword since the doom of Valyria". Which Tywin answers with that there are only three living smiths who knows how to re-work Valyrian steel and that the **finest** of them was in Volantis. This is where my theory comes in, that one of the three smiths that could re-work Valyrian steel was [this](http://imgur.com/a/VYPSV) guy. Gendrys teacher.

The theory is that Gendrys teacher knew how to re-work the material and teached Gendry how. We already know that he is a skilled blacksmith (horned helmet) and can learn how to forge things pretty fast. From [S03E06](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=5m50s).

I think that if he knows how to re-forge the steel he would be really useful in the upcoming seasons, we know Valyrian steel could kill a white walker so maybe he could help out in some way. Please tell me if it's a believable theory and if not, why doesn't it work.

EDIT: Thanks to /u/jordanmp16 we know who Gendrys master is, apparently his name is [Tobho Mott](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tobho_Mott), he is a master armorer and is one of the few smiths who knows how to re-forge Valyrian steel. This makes my theory much, much more believable and able to be revealed in the upcoming seasons/books. </TEXT>
