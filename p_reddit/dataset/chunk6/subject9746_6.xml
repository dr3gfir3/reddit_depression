	<TEXT> Alrighty OP, I'm gonna jump in on this one because I had a very similar situation happen to me when I was dating my ex a few years back. Yes, your suspicions are valid and, yes, these are alarming red flags. My ex was hanging out with guys behind my back that she considered her "friends" but had no idea she had a boyfriend. All it took was a random mutual friend connection with an acquaintance of mine to let the truth slip out that she was cheating on me. Your girlfriend clearly does not consider your feelings as important. I would recommend getting out of that relationship before you're strung along, which seems to be a common activity for her since she's keeping her exes in her back pocket just in case. It appears like you had a mature conversation about what made you comfortable/uncomfortable and she did not care to respect that. To me, that is something that does not change over time. Sorry this is happening to you, OP. Hope everything works out for the better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agree with this^. I gave my ex the exact same decision: "If you don't want this, we can end it right now and start moving on." She said she wanted to work on it but continued to treat me like shit and hang out with other guys behind my back and then broke up with me two weeks later (after we exchanged Christmas gifts). Sometimes an individual knows they want out but don't want to commit to the possibility of being alone. Pretty sure my ex just strung me along until she found someone else. Do yourself a favor and end it sooner rather than later, OP. It just sounds like she's just stuck in limbo between those two decisions. Sorry to hear about this, OP. Hoping for the best.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One that I find myself always going back to for a quick read is Perks of Being a Wallflower. But some others:

Harry Potter Series

A Song of Ice and Fire Series

The Opposite of Loneliness 

The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao 

The Interestings 

I'm sure I forgot a few but those are some that come to mind.
