	<TEXT> I understand people not liking him or find him annoying, but some of the stuff I read on here made it seem like he was some kind of monster. So going into it made me love the book even more cause I was laughing at his cynical thoughts and realized pretty early that he was just a struggling teenager. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Name some books that you expected to be difficult to get through based on its subject matter, length, writing, or other factors that turned out to be preconceived. 

For me it would be *The Count of Monte Cristo* by Alexandre Dumas because my lack of knowledge about it going in lead me to judge the book by its length and French origin. The book ended up being fast paced and easy to follow.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have only been a reader for about 7 months now and have been catching up on mostly modern classics. So in no order, here are the best i've read in this time:

- **11/22/63** - single handedly rekindled my love for reading. It took me to another place, another time, and made me feel like I was living in the 60's and hanging out with the characters. It started my newly found addiction.

- **East of Eden** - For the first time I couldn't fathom how one person sitting down to write could come up with a story so beautiful and tragic. I think I called all members of my family right after. 

- **Watership Down** - The first time I felt like I was on an adventure. The rabbits came to life, and there are these 2 chapters near the end that blew my mind. 

- **The Count of Monte Cristo** - although I got a taste of this with 11.22.63, this most certainly conquered my fear of long books. I now love the journey of longer books because so much time is spent in its world that you feel awful and satifisfied at the same time after you finish. Dantes is the most badass character I know. 

- **To Kill a Mockingbird** - A book that made me feel nostalgic in the best way possible, not for the time period, but for my own childhood. Playing silly games outside with friends and suspecting certain adults are these scary monsters. Also just helped reinforce in my mind that everyone is born a human being, how we look at each other is taught and not some genetic disposition. 

- **The Catcher in the Rye** - First time I went from laughing out loud at a character, to loving a character, to hating a character, and then feeling sorry for a character back and forth in a just a matter of pages. It will stick with me forever.

- **Animal Farm** - My first experience loving animal characters in a book, before I read Watership. First time I laughed out loud and nearly cried during a book as well. And it's not even about animals after all. 

- **Of Mice and Men** - A book that made me love the beauty of the written word. It made me feel like I was in the fields or in the barns with the characters. It just gave me this cozy feeling reading it that I can't explain. And then it shit all over that cozy feeling. 

- **Flowers for Algernon** - The first book that just crushed me and made me think about what I can do to better myself. How I can treat people around me better.

- **And Then There Were None** - One of the first books I didn't want to put down and couldn't wait to get back to. I felt a comrodery with the people stranded at that mansion and wanted them to find out the mystery so bad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm finally reading Catcher in the Rye for the first time and I'm impressed with how well Holden's character is written. On the surface he seems to be just a judgmental and annoying teenager but he has so many subtle qualities that are redeemable. I'm really not suprised many people don't see this. 

I'm going to check out the other's on your list now, thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice. I'm definitely going to read the book eventually, likely once the series is over I guess. I still haven't met anyone who has both read and watched it that could tell me if I would be safe reading the book. Something tells me the show is much different judging that the book isn't very long. Still, I don't want to risk knowing the ending yet.  </TEXT>
