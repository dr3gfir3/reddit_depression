"Rotten, wretched son of a bitch," I muttered as I got to my feet, kicking off the fucking heels they always insist I wear.

Heels. In the middle of the fucking woods.

I spat. Blood, but no teeth. My goddamn head was pounding though and I could feel the fresh welt without even touching it. And the heat... the fire outside must've reached the roof.

Below me, the cabin floor was a vacant, smoldering hole. That black shit that always falls off of It was caked into the broken wooden slats, though no blood other than what I had just spit up. Not a good sign. The bastard probably got away.

I exited the cabin as the flames indeed engulfed the roof, the low hanging branches handing the fire over like a pitcher pouring water. Outside, all three dogs were gone, though their bloody prints remained. I doubt any of my soldiers survived either. That bastard probably slipped away while they were being eaten alive.

"Routine," I said. I couldn't help but smile.

It's a word that gets thrown around far too much for my liking, especially in my line of work. If this were Hollywood, they'd probably call me a "Professional" or a "Cleaner." I preferred nothing more than businesswoman myself, but I guess it doesn't quite have the same effect.

Of course, my business is certainly unique and appearances are everything. You can't meet with a small town mayor dressed in fatigues or a lab coat, it sends the wrong message. And I always tried to look my best on the job (heels or not), though I've always felt a little silly wearing a business-casual suit to... what?... maintain a monster? Sure, it sounds a little silly. But I often fumble to find a better noun to describe that goddamn Thing.

That Thing...

Fuck, I hate It. Don't even like thinking about It. The first time I saw It, It was pretending to be a log. A goddamn log, just lying around in the middle of that godforsaken nothing Town.

One of the tracking dogs started sniffing It. Before the poor creature could even bark, the Thing opened up like a fucking bear trap, split right in half. Even after it closed again, I could still hear the animal's choked, gurgled whimper.

And the gnashing and the chewing and the slithery slurp as It... digested...

I spat again just thinking about It. That was a very long time ago, but I still remember those faces. "The Townspeople." Cult was more fucking like it. Falling and bowing, some of them were even weeping. Sobbing their goddamn eyes out while a fucking log fucking ate a fucking dog.

Surreal doesn't even begin to describe it.

And now here I was, nearly 100 miles from The Town. A hundred miles and an impossible amount of years later and I still shudder when I think about that first encounter. But business was business, what are you going to do?

Funny, this wasn't even the first time the damn Thing got this far out, It even came to the same place (near enough anyway). Two of our earliest finds, a local principal and a teacher. In the 70's, they tried to conjure the fucking Thing with rituals and orgies. It worked alright.

Some of the families still don't know the truth about what happened to the victims. Bradfield, the teacher... total crony. He took the fall, actually believed the damn Thing was a god. Thought Smith was too... Smith, the principal. We faked his death, sent him to The Town. 

We had to. We had to figure out exactly how he managed to call It to him... boy, that fucking weird pervert. I've been around for a long time. Too long. But it still makes me shudder, looking into those black eyes of his.

And now here we were again. My team had begun to circle the cabin, weapons ready. When we first arrived, we could see the moron through the window, clutching his walkie, looked like he had just seen a goddamn ghost. I didn't bother knocking, just walked right in. If the intel was correct, that fucking Thing was just around the corner.

The guy was younger, barely 30. There was a second guy too and a family. They would be dealt with as well. The cops knew enough to keep their mouth shut. What did the file say? "Bear attack"? Real original, guys.

"Who the hell are you?" he demanded, choking on his own frightened words. I think he may have even been crying. He looked at me, then back to the walkie in his hand, panic shaking his entire frame. I didn't blame his demeanor, who knows what that fucking Thing said to him.

"Relax, Samuel, try to relax," I cooed to him. "I'm a doctor. And I know what you're going through right now and I just wish to help."

From outside the closest window, the darkness lit up as the first of our jarhead patrol laid down a swath of liquid fire from one of the 'throwers. Great timing, fellas.

Sam yelped and then jumped, his fragile state shaken even further. This time I actually reached out, lowering the walkie in his sweaty grip as I laid a reassuring hand upon his shoulder.

"It's okay, it's going to be okay," I whispered as the needle tip touched his side.

Maybe I'm getting too old or maybe too comfortable or maybe, deep down, I just don't want to do this goddamn job anymore. But the motherfucker got the jump on me. Bounced back the second he felt the needle, giving me a hard shove at the same time.

As I fumbled backwards, three more flamethrowers ignited. And I could hear barking too... followed by the inevitable screaming.

You know, I've seen this Thing in action more than I would ever care to think about, especially in a wooded setting. That's where the flamethrowers come in. It's supposed to be a controlled burn, something to spook It back where we want It. The new Pocket Protector's work well enough too, but only in close range (for now anyway).

Though if it were up to me, we'd definitely be doing things differently. Much louder for one if you catch my drift. Unfortunately, the upper brass has frowned upon the whole "Shock   Awe" routine ever since '62, but I couldn't disagree more. The ground troops never, ever work out. 

But of course... maybe that's the point. 

After all, never squander the opportunity to see your weapon in action. We may have not made the damn Thing (well, not completely), but rest assured: It's as lethal as they come. It could also explain why I'm usually the only one to get a Protector during these missions.

But I digress. Muted gunshots joined in with the burning hot mayhem outside. Though the barks and shouting alike would eventually succumb to whimpering and crying and begging, even in the span of half a minute. 

The usual routine.

"The fuck is that Thing? How did it sound like... what is It?" Samuel shouted over the outside commotion, holding the walkie up in the air. He kept sputtering out nonsense even as I pulled out my sidearm, taking aim without hesitation.

Something loud and wet struck the cabin window, leaving a sticky crimson residue as it slid out of view. Sam jumped again, almost dropping the walkie. I took the opportunity to regain control.

"Listen goddamnit!" I shouted, pointing my pussy 9-mil around like I owned the place. "We could've done this the easy way, but I see that's not going to happen! Now I can explain every-"

I was cut off as the walkie exploded across my fucking forehead. I couldn't believe it! The guy had flung it at me, he didn't even give me a chance to monologue... they always wanted to hear the Bond villain monologue that answered everything! Hell, I sort of began to relish it over the years. The building could (in this case literally) be on fire and they still wanted answers. Always. This was definitely a first.

I almost respected it. Almost. 

As I hit the floor, there was a low rumble and the entire cabin began to shake. Before I could even gather my thoughts, the floor between us exploded into dust and splinters and smoke. My vision began to blur as I just made out one of the growths. It snaked It's impossible, ugly form skyward, rising through the fiery smoke, looming menacingly over the entirety of the cabin.

On cue, my Pocket Protector whirred to life, sending out the frequency that keeps It at bay. I heard It squeal in agony as the form rescinded. Samuel didn't waste any time. He grabbed my gun off the floor, getting ready to leave. I grasped his arm weakly and he actually stopped. For a moment, I thought he might actually save me.

Instead, he reached into my jacket and snagged my car keys and cell. The bastard. I passed out immediately afterwards.

I was out for 10 minutes, couldn't have been any longer. But it was morning now, hours later. The guy was long gone. Funny, I thought as the sun began to rise over the smoldering remains of the former cabin. I probably saved the poor chump's life.

Before I could even smile at the thought, I heard the usual trail of black vans behind me as they began to pull up. A caravan of fire trucks brought up the rear. The van doors opened in unison as they came to a stop, the occupants of the closest vehicle rushing to my aid. One of the grunts even grabbed my elbow.

"Dr. Rabinovitch, are you alri-"

"Sir, goddamnit," I cut him off as I brushed away his touch. A cheap looking cigarillo was hanging from his ear. I snagged it.

"Oh, um... any sign of the... It, ma'am... sir?" he stammered uncomfortably, pulling at his collar in the heat. Always cracked me up, these giant braindead thugs we hired, stuffed into a three piece.

 "Took off," I said, tapping my Protector. "Where's my fucking car?"

"Once we realized there was something wrong, we backtracked the GPS," the grunt started as he handed me a light. "He stuck around town for a little bit, but eventually he went... well... sir..."

I took a quick drag, but spat for the third time that morning as the moron trailed off. The smoke tasted like shit and my head began to throb again.

"I know where he went, damn it," I blurted as I stomped out the cig as my jarheads filed towards the cabin remains.

There was more than enough evidence in the glove compartment alone. Enough evidence to point him in the right direction. And if he was as sharp as he seemed, there's no way he ran off to the authorities. Hell, we are The Authority as far as the authorities were concerned.

And as for the media, well... you probably don't even want to know.

But what I really can't stop thinking about is that look on his face as he clutched that walkie. That desperate combination of fear and sadness and incredulous disregard for danger. I had seen it before. Many times. Too many goddamn times.

Whatever he heard on the other side of that radio, whatever that damn Thing was trying to sound like... he'd go looking for It.

"I know where he went," I found myself repeating, my words disappearing into the cold, smokey morning air. I began to gather my underlings, pulling them towards the lineup of cars.

"Leave the cabin for the townies," I said. "We're heading back to [Centralia](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/60zd51/everyone_in_pennsylvania_knows_about_centralia/)." </TEXT>

[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/68oyzl/centralia_pennsylvania/?st=J26NIWT0 sh=929a897d)

When we were kids, my parents would take us on day trips to Centralia. It's a little town in central Pennsylvania. It'd be just like any of the dozens of other secluded towns in central PA except for the fact that it's mostly abandoned. Some kind of underground fire that forced everyone to flee.

Mostly everyone anyway. If all of this sounds kind of familiar, it's because they made a movie about it a few years ago. Well it was a movie based on a video game, but for the film's script, they took elements from Centralia's history.

I bring this up because the success of the film turned the town into sort of a tourist trap, though the locals certainly don't think so. One glance at their Facebook page and you'll see dozens of complaints and angry rants focused on the usual "teens and hooligans" that keep trespassing, looking for a thrill. I guess I can't say I blame them.

Like I said, my parents used to take our sister and I there from time to time. This was before the film came out, so the place was just an interesting, mostly empty footnote in PA's history. My parents found it peaceful I think. They'd tell us to explore to our heart's content for an hour or two while they went looking for some alone time. We'd do our thing, though we always left in a total hurry. Weird, sure, but as a kid I didn't think much of it.

Anyway, I hadn't thought about the place in a long time. That is until a few years ago, the guy who wrote the movie came to my film school in Pitt. Nice enough guy, though he was involved in a fatal hit and run that landed him in prison. Part of a lessened sentence was coming to our school and telling a bunch of wannabe filmmakers how to get into the business. Community service I guess, though I didn't know they handed down that type of thing for manslaughter.

But I digress. The Q   A was going great  (Tarantino's a dick? Who'd a thunk it!) until somebody brought up his Centralia film. The guy smiled, kind of, before he started to wax nostalgic, telling us how his father had told him stories growing up about Centralia and how it eventually formed the outline for his script. In fact, he told us being in PA brought the old feelings back. At that point, he started getting a little glassy eyed and cut the Q   A short.

It was a little weird, sure. But things got even stranger when I ran into the guy in the bathroom. I guess the cop stationed outside the door should have been a clue. He was leaning over the sink, watching himself in the mirror when I caught his eye. Water was dripping from his face, sliding down his cheap suit and pants.

"Everything... ok?" I hesitantly asked after an awkward minute, not sure what else to say.

"Yeah," he faked a smile. "Just a long day is all."

I smiled back as he snorted and rubbed his eyes, trying to regain his composure.

"It's funny," I said, trying to keep the convo going, "you mentioning Centralia. When I was a kid, my parents used to take my sister and I there."

The faux grin left his face, a gray shadow enveloping his eyes. I stammered something, unable to properly speak. I had never seen a transformation like that before, somebody tearing off their societal mask in a flash, revealing the saddened, bloated underbelly beneath the facade.

"You would go there?" he asked slowly. "When you were a child? Your parents would take you there?"

"Yeah... to hang out I guess," I sort of laughed. "They'd go off on their own, leave us out there to explore-"

"And what did you see?"

"Um... nothing."

"Good. Good."

His voice trailed off as he took my hand, his grasp still a clammy, wet mess.

"Your parents," he started. "They're not around anymore, are they?"

"No," I answered finding it more and more difficult to meet his glance. "They died in a car accident... maybe five years ago."

"Your sister too?"

"Yeah... yes. Same thing a year later. Same highway even. Right near..."

I paused, my glance turning sideways. Suddenly a horrible coincidence that had shadowed the last six years of my life seemed like a small part in a lavish plot. I couldn't explain it then and I certainly can't explain it now. But somehow, I just knew. I always knew.

"They leave one alive," he said bluntly. "Every time." 

Before I could say anything, he continued, his grip tightening, "You know, the night of my accident, It tried to look like my dead mother."

"What?"

"I was drunk, I never denied that," he said ignoring my question. "But I swerved to try to hit It. I didn't even think twice when I saw her... It. I tried to run It over the moment I saw It on the side of the road." He paused for a moment, rubbing his temples, stifling a manic laugh. "I missed. I guess."

He released his grasp and began to head towards the paper towel dispenser, leaving me with a soaking wet hand and too many questions.

"Ever thought about going back?" he asked without even turning around.

"No," I answered carefully. "Never. Never thought there was a reason too."

"Good," he said. "And don't. That Thing they worship. It's always hungry, It always wants more." He turned around finally, looking me dead in the eye. "It never stops."

"It?"

"It," he repeated as he opened the bathroom door and prepared to exit. Before taking his leave, however, he turned around to face me one last time. But I had had enough.

"Listen dude, I don't know where you get off telling me-"

He cut me off. Smiled even.

"I understand you're angry. I was too. But if you ever do go back, well..." he trailed off. For a brief moment I thought he was just going to walk out without another word. 

"I don't know what they call It now," he finally continued, "but back then, in Centralia, everyone called It the [Crick It](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zv4li/everyone_in_valley_forge_knows_about_the_crick_it/?ref=search_posts)." </TEXT>

It's a regional term, crick is anyway. It's just a creek. A Pennsylvania thing apparently. No idea why. But that's just the way it is:

"Don't get too close to the crick."

"A crick runs through it."

"Don't go near the crick at night."

That last one, that's the kicker. But I guess I should start with a little history.

If you've never been, Valley Forge as a park is a little different than what you might be thinking. Last year Jim Breuer came to the casino in town and started his set by saying he thought of VF as like The Alamo, some kind of fortress. The opposite couldn't be more true. Wide open fields clashing with thick patches of deep forest. There's some cabins strewn about too. Fake of course, meant to look like the ones Washington and the boys lived in (starved in?). Some fat guy in the 70's built them after he decided the park needed more authenticity. Irony I guess. Anyway, in the day time, the park is all peaceful bike rides, laughing children and picnicking families.

At night it's a little different.

I've worked in VF for almost 12 years now, since I graduated high school. I'm sort of a ranger but without a gun or cuffs or any real authority whatsoever.  They call my position an official park explorer. I guess it's the same thing as calling a mall cop a store detective. Just sounds better. Reynolds, a fellow "explorer," even made us fake business cards with a magnifying glass and a fucking tree on it. Very funny.

Reynolds was a good egg. Older fellow than me, he joined us two summer's ago after his wife passed away. Just quit his office job and joined the park. Nice enough fellow, though for a guy who lost his wife at 45, he seemed way too jovial all the time, even when he first joined us. Then again, that might just be the cynic in me talking.

Anyway, things used to be nice and quiet but a few months ago we began hearing of these stories going around amongst the local school kids. Urban legends, I guess, some of them even started asking questions about it during the school field trips.

Basically, there's a monster in the park and it only comes out at night. It blends in, weaves its way through the trees and the grass, sometimes on all fours, sometimes standing straight up and the size of a house.

The Crick It they call it. As in "It came from the crick!" or some B movie nonsense. It became kind of a joke at first amongst us old heads. "Don't go near the crick at night!" was the usual staticky cat call coming through the walkie talkies when we went on our rounds. And when newbies asked what we meant we always said the same thing:

"Oh, EVERYONE in Valley Forge knows about the Crick It!"

We'd rattle off some bullshit story about VF's very own Bigfoot that lived by the crick. It was workplace funny of course. Reynolds and I would crack up, sort of, but it wasn't exactly something you'd recite to your actual friends expecting a laugh. The real funny thing is that The Forge didn't need a monster, it was plenty weird at night as it was.

Last year a new guy quit after his first overnight, said he saw a hunched over thin man, covered in blood, wrapped in bandages. It would appear in the doorway of every cabin he passed. Crying softly and whimpering for help. Thought for sure we were pulling something on him. Not the case. He arrived back before dawn, missing his hat and talkie, said the thing started to look like his dead father, but not quite. He bailed, dropping his gear as he ran.

Looked like him, but not quite... that always kind of got me. 

There's plenty more stories like that, weird noises, weird sights. Of course, I figure that's any wooded area at night. Semi-supernatural nonsense, but nothing that ever really bites back.

'Til yesterday anyway.

Little girl and her brother went missing during the day. Parents were LIVID. As if I have some kind of sonar in my pocket.

"It's 2017," they practically said in unison towards Reynolds. "It's impossible to get lost in 2017," the mom finished looking in my direction, almost smiling.

The smile faded I imagine when she saw the look on my face. It's not that I didn't care, it's just the truth of the matter was something any park ranger (or goddamn park explorer) worth their salt could tell you: it's VERY easy to get lost in 2017 just like it's been VERY easy to get lost in the woods since man first decided to hunt. Lost and killed.

Unfortunately, I thought as I looked into the sunken eyes of the two parents before me, I knew exactly how they felt.

Well, they were in luck... sort of. Reynolds and I found the daughter the next morning. The cops arrived the night before and we ended up searching until dawn. The whole night, bumbling around, finding nothing. Just as we're about to take a little break, Reynolds and I round a corner and there she was, the sun beaming down on her through the glistening leaves. She was pale as a ghost, but otherwise seemed unharmed.

Now if you're from the area, you probably recall the story: kids were dragged off by a bear, taken alive and pulled into a cave. The boy didn't make the night but the girl escaped in the morning.

Couple problems of course: 1.) I'm twelve years into this job and I never once saw a bear in the park. Ever. I think we're just too damn close to the burbs. 2.) A bear attacked two kids and... what?... kidnapped them? Took them back to its cave to hang out?

Not likely.

See, I know what really happened... well, what the little girl claims anyway before the real officials arrived.

We got her into the administration cabin while I radioed the police on the other side of the park. Reynolds managed to find her a blanket and a juice box left over from the day camp. 

And that's when it all came pouring out, we didn't even have to prod her:

Says one second her brother was there, the next he was enveloped by the ground. She told us the dirt "became a man... but not quite," stood straight up and wrapped the boy in its arms. Told us its head was fairly normal except for the mouth. Managed to wrap its entire jaw around the boy from the waist up like a snake. She was pretty sure her brother screamed the whole time he was devoured, but was completely muffled.

We asked why she didn't run or scream herself. She told us it had her around the leg like a tentacle made of flesh and dirt and leaves. Said the whole time she felt hypnotized, she couldn't even recall how her and brother got so deep into the woods in the first place. After its meal, it began to drag her through the woods. Said it attempted to hum some Kings of Leon song her dad had been humming just a minute before they wandered away. But the pitch was all wrong. "Like air escaping a balloon," she managed to mumble before her eyes went wide, the juice box fell to the floor and she began to scream. And I mean SCREAM.

"CRICK IT! CRICK IT!" 

She was pointing at the window the whole time. The parents and I tried to calm her, grabbing her shoulders. Reynolds turned around to look at the window. I heard him gag on his own words as he stumbled backwards, almost tripping over the little girl, grabbing my shoulder and pointing too.

I looked of course. Nothing there. Only the trees.

The girl kept screaming, over and over. Cops took her away still wailing, I'm surprised they didn't try to gag her. Reynolds just sat there, clutching his hat on the front stoop of the cabin.

"You okay?" I asked as the cops pulled away.

"I just need some time off," he practically whispered. "I think it's finally... I think I just need some time off."

He actually quit the next day.

Why bring this all up? Well, in twelve years I've seen a lot of nonsense in this park.  A LOT. So when something this intense happens, yeah sure, it bugs me for a little bit. But eventually it drifts away. It has to otherwise we'd all go mad.

Go mad.

That's the feeling I can't escape as I sit here now, my usual Thursday overnight. Except this time, no Reynolds. Just me and the talkie.

A talkie that just crackled to life.

"EveryONE in VALLEY forge KNOWS aBOUT the CRICK it," a voice squealed from the other side. A voice that sounded like air escaping from a balloon. </TEXT>
