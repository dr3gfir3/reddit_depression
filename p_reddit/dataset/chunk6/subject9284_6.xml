	<TEXT> I was thinking about this today.

For example a dude was using dioxsis grenade in a walker assault (graveyard of giants) and . . . Obv it was dumb.

But what if dioxsis somehow did more damage inside than outside.  

What if other star cards were also modified based on environmental factors.  Say Hoth (excess cold) makes Vehicles more susceptible to damage.

Basically chance the validity of a package so it's not all the same, depending on what map you are on and whether it's cold, windy, enclosed, ventilated, sunny, rainy, etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Three robbers break into a bank, but when they open the safe, they find only boxes. 

One robber opens a box and finds cups full of yogurt.

"We didn't find any money, but we got something to eat," he tells his partners. 

They eat their fill and leave.

The next morning's newspaper headline reads:

 "World's Largest Sperm Bank Robbed." </TEXT>
