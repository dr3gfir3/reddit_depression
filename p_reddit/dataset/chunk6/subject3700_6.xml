	<TEXT> Of course he would've, he is a true believer, and like Carter, he would've failed. 

That is what you centrists don't get though, you have to fail sometimes to win, being timid in politics capitulates the narrative to the other side, and there is always an *other* side.  The House GOP mindlessly voted against Obamacare, lost all of those votes, and now they just won re-election from lowbrow political theater.    

Sometimes you gotta fight to win -- even if it is a paper tiger, and that also means sometimes getting right on back up and talking the same shit to the motherfucker who just socked ya in your jaw.

	<TEXT> Of course they want to move forward, but no one was ever going to help them.  Maybe Sanders, but really no other politician cares about these people, even their own Reps and Senators sell them out.  

Think about this, who has more money defense firms or rural health clinics?  Defense firms, and that is whose ear people like Mitch McConnell care about.  Mitch loathes being in Kentucky, he spends 95% of his life in DC now.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think the loathing for Hoover can be underestimated. Hoover's unpopularity deintellectualized the GOP party until the Rockefeller Republicans came along 20 years later, literally everyone with a brain was a Democrat during WWII and the immediate post-war era.  

Trump might have doomed the GOP to something like that.   </TEXT>
