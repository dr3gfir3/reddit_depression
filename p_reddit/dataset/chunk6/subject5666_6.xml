	<TEXT> McMaster concluded his study by stating that the Vietnam war was based on deception, and it was lost in Washington, D.C., even before Americans assumed sole responsibility for the fighting in 1965 and before they realized the country was at war; indeed, even before the first American units were deployed.






That McMaster is acutely aware of deceptions role in starting wars is one thing, but that he devoted years to exposing it is a great reflection on McMasters character and worldview presuppositions.






This is very encouraging  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's look at the evidence:




Paul Manafort was an operative working in Ukraine to install a pro-Russian government.
You worked closely with Paul Manafort for years and own a lobbying firm with him in DC. 

Paul Manafort went missing for several weeks in 2010 (and 2014). This is the same year that the opposition research/dossier claims that Trump began to be cultivated by Moscow. You openly joked that Paul Manafort was kidnapped by the Russians. (See previous links)




Donald Trump began his birtherism allegation in 2011.
Russia hacked Podesta's email account on March 19, 2016.




General Michael Flynn (~Summer 2016) and Carter Page (~March 2016) join the campaign. Both of them have ties to Russia.




Cory Lewandowski was fired from Trumps campaign. Paul Manafort took over. (June 20, 2016)




Trumps position on Russia changed, particularly as it relates to Ukraine. (~ July 18, 2016)




It is discovered that Paul Manafort received an off-the-books 12 million dollar payment from Ukraine. (~August 2016 it is discovered. Payments from 2007-2012.)




The DNC emails hacked by Russia are leaked by WikiLeaks. (July 22, 2016)




Trump invites Russia to hack Hillary Clintons emails. (July 27, 2016) Video proof.




Trump hires Steve Bannon. You and Steve Bannon had a prior relationship. (August 17, 2016) 




Paul Manaforts ties were discovered and he resigned. He continues to live in Trump Tower and advise Donald Trump. (August 19, 2016) 




You tweeted in a way to suggest you had knowledge of the Podesta leaks BEFORE any information about it was released. (August 21, 2016)




Podesta emails hacked by Russia are leaked by WikiLeaks. (October 7, 2016) The leak occurred within a few hours after the Access Hollywood video surfaced.





The United States Intelligence Community formally accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and John Podesta. (October 7, 2016) Trump denies it. Source 2 





Trump won the election. (November 8, 2016) He continued to be soft on Russia.





Trump nominates Rex Tillerson to become the Secretary of State. (December 13, 2016) Tillerson is pro-Russia for business purposes.






The Intelligence Community formally declares that the highest levels of the Kremlin were behind the hacking. (December 2016)





President Obama imposes sanctions on Russia and kicks out 35 Russians diplomats. (December 2016) Putin decides not to immediately retaliate and will wait to see what Donald Trump does after assuming office. (December 2016) Source 2






Declassified Intelligence Report is released with the conclusions of the Intelligence Community.





Buzzfeed publishes 35 page dossier. (January 9, 2017) The dossier was prepared by respected former MI6 spy, Christopher Steele. Before this, Mr. Steele was most popularly known for investigating the corruption at FIFA. He was so frustrated with the FBI's disinterest that he worked for free following the election. He has since gone into hiding. Source 2 Source 3






Trump was briefed on the 35 page dossier by FBI Director Comey.







Trump mocked (and continues to mock) the various Intelligence Agencies in the United States. He sides with Russias response to the dossier. He also praised Wikileaks and Julian Assange. See also Donald Trump's tweets and his January press conference.






Trump finally admits Russia was at fault for hacking, but promises to better relations with Russia. He also indicates that Putin will not hack the US again with Trump as President. Source 2







There is evidence that Michael Flynn called Russias ambassador to the United States on the same day that President Obama announced sanctions and expelled Russian officials. He insists it was unrelated to sanctions. Source 2








I could speculate on Rosneft, but I won't.
These are only some of the reasons that I have to say, respectfully, I don't believe you.

	<TEXT> I agree with that, she was a horrible candidate. But Cambridge analytics was considered a huge success and will be used more going forward. They are honing in there data and it's going to be even more effective in the future. 


All the models had Hillary Clinton winning the presidency, and to date, there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why those models were wrong. A report from the Swiss publication Das Magazin and adapted by Motherboard has a fascinating story about how it might have happened, thanks to Facebook quizzes and a small company called Cambridge Analytica  the same company that worked on the online campaign for Brexit.
The story starts with Michal Kosinski, a psychologist with the Psychometrics Centre at Cambrige University. In 2008, Kosinski and a fellow researcher  both students at the time  were experimenting with Facebook quizzes that zeroed in on what psychologists call The Big Five personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, or OCEAN. The quiz-takers could opt in to sharing their data with the researchers, and to the researchers' surprise, millions did.
Kosinski began correlating this personality data with a person's "likes." From Motherboard:
PLAY DIRTY



DISCOVER
In 2012, Kosinski proved that on the basis of an average of 68 Facebook likes by a user, it was possible to predict their skin color (with 95 percent accuracy) their sexual orientation (88 percent accuracy), and their affiliation to the Democratic or Republican party (85 percent). But it didnt stop there. Intelligence, religion, as well as alcohol, cigarette and drug use, could all be determined. From the data it was even possible to deduce whether deduce whether someone's parents were divorced.
Liking Wu-Tang Clan is one of the best indicators for heterosexuality, Kosinski found, while "liking" Lady Gaga correlated highly with extroversion. Eventually, Facebook made "like" data private, but researchers could still collect it by asking users to opt in. (If you want to try it, you can head over to Kosinskis website applymagicsauce.com.)
So what does all this have to do with elections? In 2014, a young assistant professor named Aleksandr Kogan requested access to Kosinski's database on behalf of an election management agency based in London called Strategic Communications Laboratories. Kosinski turned Kogan down, but Kogan went ahead and registered a company under SCL's umbrella called Cambridge Analytica  an homage, he said, to the university's work in the field. Cambridge Analytica, under CEO Alexander Nix, went on to work for the pro-Brexit campaign, Senator Ted Cruz's presidential nomination bid, and then on Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
On the day of the third presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, Trumps team tested 175,000 different ad variations for his arguments
According to a presentation given by Nix and described by the reporters, Cambridge Analytica took Facebook targeting to a new level.
Up to now, explains Nix, election campaigns have been organized based on demographic concepts. A really ridiculous idea. The idea that all women should receive the same message because of their genderor all African Americans because of their race. What Nix meant is that while other campaigners so far have relied on demographics, Cambridge Analytica was using psychometrics.
Cambridge Analytica used Big Five traits to develop personality-specific messaging, Nix said in the presentation:
For a highly neurotic and conscientious audience the threat of a burglaryand the insurance policy of a gun. An image on the left shows the hand of an intruder smashing a window. The right side shows a man and a child standing in a field at sunset, both holding guns, clearly shooting ducks: Conversely, for a closed and agreeable audience. People who care about tradition, and habits, and family.
Nix also spoke to the reporters:
...Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven, Alexander Nix remembers. On the day of the third presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, Trumps team tested 175,000 different ad variations for his arguments, in order to find the right versions above all via Facebook. The messages differed for the most part only in microscopic details, in order to target the recipients in the optimal psychological way: different headings, colors, captions, with a photo or video. This fine-tuning reaches all the way down to the smallest groups, Nix explained in an interview with us. We can address villages or apartment blocks in a targeted way. Even individuals.
This approach was also used to discourage potential Clinton voters, according to the reporters, and was also used by door-to-door canvassers:
From July 2016, Trump canvassers were provided with an app with which they could identify the political views and personality types of the inhabitants of a house. It was the same app provider used by Brexit campaigners. Trumps people only rang at the doors of houses that the app rated as receptive to his messages. The canvassers came prepared with guidelines for conversations tailored to the personality type of the resident. In turn, the canvassers fed the reactions into the app, and the new data flowed back to the dashboards of the Trump Campaign.
The decision to focus on Michigan and Wisconsin in the final weeks of the campaign was made on the basis of data analysis
This data is what made Trump hone in on specific swing counties, according to the reporters:
The Democrats did similar things, but there is no evidence that they relied on psychometric profiling. Cambridge Analytica, however, divided the US population into 32 personality types, and focused on just 17 states. And just as Kosinski had established that men who like MAC cosmetics are slightly more likely to be gay, the company discovered that a preference for cars made in the US was a great indication of a potential Trump voter. Among other things, these findings now showed Trump which messages worked best and where. The decision to focus on Michigan and Wisconsin in the final weeks of the campaign was made on the basis of data analysis. The candidate became the instrument for implementing a big data model.
After the original German publication of this story, Cambridge Analytica denied that it uses data from Facebook  which contradicts previous statements made by the company  or that it adapted Kosinski's approach.
The power and accuracy of big data tends to be overhyped. When members of Outline staff  admittedly, not a crew that likes a lot of stuff on Facebook  tried Kosinski's site, the results were mixed.
The story, which is worth reading in full, is also inconclusive. It's difficult to tell exactly what impact Cambridge Analytica had on the election, and how much of it was due to Facebook personality targeting. However, the unexpected rise of Cruz during the primaries and his win in Iowa; coupled with Trump's unexpected win and the failure of polls to predict it, supports that conclusion. Either way, we're starting to realize the consequences of giving up so much personal information to Facebook for free. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Russian Defense Ministry has formalized its information-warfare efforts with a dedicated propaganda division, Russian state-run media said on Wednesday, the Associated Press reports.








"Propaganda needs to be clever, smart and efficient," said Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in reference to the new unit.






But Russia has long been accused of spreading propaganda in the West. Business Insider's Barbara Tasch detailed one case where Russian outlets spread a false story of a Russian-born 13-year-old being raped in Germany by a group of three refugees.








Russia's use of propaganda as an element of "hybrid warfare" proved instrumental during the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the later insurgency in Ukraine.

Since you seem sane compared to others I've interacted with on here maybe you'll read this article about the establishment and trump. Trump has surrounded himself with the dream team of the establishment, they use advanced AI on social media to control the narrative. Google Cambridge analytics if you want to read how effective that is.

The Republicans don't want to be associated with him because of all the crazy shit he says but he's doing everything they could possibly want, they will vote his bills thru and won't investigate anything he does. The Republicans are now the powers that be. 

I was a bernie guy that didn't vote for Hillary for the same reason you didn't but just by paying attention to what trump is doing is unsettling. And the media doesn't talk about issues like this article talks about, they hammer home bullshit distraction stories. I think that is by design so we're not paying attention.

	<TEXT> Good article, haven't really looked at from this angle. Some interesting observations... 


Trumps crack team of money monsters is clearly not planning on acting in the interests of American workersthey will instead do what they know best: use the considerable power of the American state to break down as many regulatory constraints on global banking finance as possible, with a special view to privilege US banks and corporations.


Mike Pompeo is the icing on the cake. As Trumps CIA director, this Republican Congressman has no obvious experience relevant to running a national intelligence agency, except perhaps for one thing: as Jane Mayer writes in her book Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right (Doubleday 2015), Pompeo is so closely entwined with the climate-change denying Koch brothers that he was known as the congressman from Koch.
The Koch brothers, who made their fortune investing in fossil fuels, now have a direct line to Americas premiere national intelligence agency. Now thats what you call a coup.



The Murdoch connection has other alarming ramifications. Since 2010, Murdoch has been an equity-holding board member of the American energy firm, Genie Oil   Gas. He had teamed up with Lord Jacob Rothschild, chairman of Rothschild Investment Trust (RIT) Capital Partners, to buy a 5.5% stake in the corporation then worth $11 million.
Murdoch and Rothschild also serve on Genies strategic advisory board. Joining them on the board are Larry Summers, former Director of President Obamas National Economic Council; former Trump senior advisor James Woolsey; Dick Cheney, former Vice-President under George W. Bush; and Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy under Clinton and Governor of New Mexico.


Kissingers critical role in developing Trumps eastward facing strategy was revealed by the German tabloid, Bild, which obtained a document from the Trump transition team. The document confirmed Kissingers role as the key mastermind brought in to craft a way to rebuild relationships with Russia. Kissingers plan would include lifting US economic sanctionspaving the way for a potentially lucrative partnership between American and Russian oil and gas companiesand recognizing Russias ownership of the Crimea.



Perhaps the most powerful takeaway from this examination of who the Trump administration actually is, is that the Trump regime is not external to the Deep State. On the contrary, the people who hold senior posts in his administration, both formal and otherwise, are key nodes that represent whole layers of social and institutional networks within and across the wider US Deep State.
If this is not immediately obvious, its because there is much misunderstanding of what the Deep State actually is. The Deep State is not simply the intelligence community. When a more accurate understanding of the American Deep State and its symbiotic embeddedness in a transnational Deep System is adopted, the role of the Trump faction can be properly discerned.



These motherfuckers are the dream team of corruption and the "deep state" we are in for a bumpy ass ride. I hope people start waking up to what's really going on. 

I also wonder how long his hard liners will make excuses for him and ignore what's actuality going on.

Here are a few sources that I've seen about Putin. He does stand to make 500 billion dollars if the sanctions are lifted so the motivation is there.

	<TEXT> The difference is I'm not denying that corporate shills are working these threads. I find it troubling that people like yourself are parroting Kremlin talking points and denying that Russian shills are on here at all. 

How could you flat out deny that Putin's army of shills would slide these type of topics? Do you know Putin stands to gain 500 billion dollars if sanctions are lifted? You don't think that's enough motivation to change public opinion on the US about Russia? Cmon man, where is your common sense? 

Oh and by the way, insinuating that I'm a shill is exactly how shills work  </TEXT>
