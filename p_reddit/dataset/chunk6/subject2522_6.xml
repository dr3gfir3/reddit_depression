	<TEXT> Hillary created the broken system.

Damn son. Clinton did not create the system. She just worked her way through it. If you are going to use the argument: 

Exploiting a broken system to your benefit is different than creating a broken system to your benefit.

then you cannot give Clinton flack for SuperPACs. The SCOTUS decision of Citizens United, which created SuperPACs, was about a smear campaign against Hillary Clinton. It was about what did and did not amount to political campaigning activity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ecause he was moved 1 month after his birth. His father left to Kenya shortly there after. He then moves to live in Indonesia for 4 years. All of this in the 60's where record keeping wasn't nearly what it is today, makes people wonder if those claims are actually true, and would like to have proof. I'm not sure why that sounds so crazy.

His mother is American. He could have been born anywhere in the world and still been considered a natural-born citizen. 

Normally your religion is on your birth certificate.

No it is never on the birth certificate. I don't know where you came up with this, but if you can prove me wrong, then I'll accept that point. 

Do you have the same issues with the circumstances of McCain's and Cruz's birth?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, your lack of explanation leaves much to be desired, but whatever.

Wew nice ad hominem.

Probably my favorite deflection from the typical armchair philosopher of reddit. But you know, you be you.

TPP, TTIP and TISA are far more than Trade deals

Yeah, of course they are. They are an attempt to secure the status quo and US global hegemony. The liberal world order relies on open borders and transparent rules to operate and bring prosperity to the world. 1 billion people have been pulled out of extreme poverty by this system over the past 20 years. These deals are not the boogeyman you are making them out to be. These are the same scare tactics used to get the people of Britain to vote to leave the EU. 

So the sweatshops in Africa and East Asia are just something I was dreaming about

These trade deals (though not with Africa) would create a regulatory framework similar to the one in the US. Sweatshops would become illegal with more mechanisms for enforcement. Binding other nations to this framework will pinch corruption a little harder and make trade a little easier. Sure, this means low-skilled jobs will move out of the US to regions with lower costs of labor, but why would this be a bad thing? Do we need unskilled labor in this country? Why don't we focus more on helping those left behind by globalization and the uneven economic prosperity it brings? Trying to reverse the trend of globalization will only hurt the American and world economies and it will not help anyone. 

Are these deals perfect? No. Can we do better? Most definitely. But progress is made piecemeal through compromise. You will never get anything done if you only act when things are perfect. If the forefathers of our nation did that, we would not have a United States of America.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is insufferable. However, it does make sense when you put it in the context of their experiences. Frequently, these men are white and have lived a life of privilege, never having to engage with someone typifying them because of what they are, and never really thinking about their identity on a day to day basis. This gets dangerous when coupled with high intelligence because more often than not, smart people don't like to think of others as less capable. They think everyone has the capacity to think through problems like they do. Unfortunately, that is just not true, but leads to the Libertarian mindset that everyone can handle all of these tasks and still be productive members of society.  </TEXT>

(R) or (L) lifetime voter here. Hillary's a career criminal who won't win another vote between now and election night, but will continue to lose them in big numbers every time she's accidentally put on TV. Being a legitimately repugnant human being running against a decent fellow is a dead end for her. And the attacks haven't even started.

Bernie's a solid human who, despite not lining up with a lot of us on politics, isn't a complete grifter. Put him up and I'll probably pick him over any of those (R) clowns. I'm in the minority of (R) for saying that, but we're a big enough minority to deliver the election to the other side. Heck, my wife and I are visiting your primaries this year to help him, even.

As far as I can see, the only screw up in the (D) side is not being 100% behind Bernie, the only real chance to pull any of the (R) you'll need to counter the Trump wave.

Signed, (R) maybe for Bernie. Maybe. Probably. If Hillary doesn't cost him my vote between now and then.

	<TEXT> You would definitely be on the political fringe if you support those ideologies, though it is interesting because some of them are complete opposites. Can you explain what it is you like about each one?

Pure capitalism is now called libertarianism. This is not the world we live in anymore. We have regulations because it is understood people are shitty and illogical. The system is not about people being morally good, it is about people generally making good decisions when it comes to making money. Regulations exist to prevent the excesses of that system and reduce the economic swings inherent to it. 

One of the big tenets of anarchism is that the government should not have a monopoly on the use of force. When that happens you get warlords just like you have in Somalia. It may not have achieved the system on purpose, but it is an anarchist state now. 

Spain was pretty terrible before Franco took over. If you are trying to use it as a positive example, could you elaborate more? </TEXT>

The president is stuck with it because of Bush. Look what happened when we pulled out of Iraq too quickly. We got ISIS. We can't just walk away from our obligations and think the problems will just go away or get better. Syria would be less of a murderfest if we got involved like we did in Libya. Libya is awful, but not worse off than Syria and there are fewer casualties in Libya. 

tax cuts for the rich

I think you are confusing platforms here. Trump and the Republican party still ascribe to trickle down economics and tax cuts for the rich. [Hillary's plan specifically raises taxes on people with income greater than $1 million](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals/full).

hand outs to big corporations

Come on their is a reason the Koch brothers hate the Dems so much. This is exactly the opposite of the Dem platform. 

sending jobs overseas

The president doesn't send jobs anywhere. Low-skilled jobs are just disappearing from a combination of globalization and automation. Would you rather pay more for your things? [Most Americans don't want to](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0ahUKEwjdydiZz5bOAhWC2yYKHRiPCUQQFgghMAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ftimworstall%2F2016%2F03%2F30%2Famericans-dont-want-american-goods-they-prefer-imports%2F usg=AFQjCNGrHnK8lrLYnKNkHqq4gA2NxWLxWA sig2=rNj73DgAWm3qeMKIewxBTQ) but that is exactly what Trump is promoting.

Any time civil rights move forward conservative white people feel scared of all the change and inclusion because now they have to share and don't always get their way.

	<TEXT> Western influence can't truly affect the dynamic in the region, not in the long term. The best we can hope for is risk mitigation and containment. That is a big reason why there is such international support for defeating ISIS. There can be no stability in Syria as long as ISIS holds Syrian territory. The number of refugees would decrease dramatically if Assad regain control over all Syrian territory. Assad's return to power is the only stable option left. It's uncertain how this will affect lone wolf terrorist attacks. All of these issues short-term however. Post-invasion, the US has very little credibility in the Middle East beyond military and security support. That gives the US very little influence to support its interests.  </TEXT>

It doesn't matter how he blatantly twists crime statistics to make the country look less safe than it actually is even though violent crime is near the same levels as the 1950s. He strikes fear in our allies around the world as he espouses imperialism. His protectionist views on our trade agreements show a complete and utter lack of understanding. He can't maintain a coherent policy point in the least. He is against the 1st, 5th, and 14th amendment. Has Clinton said she is against any of our Constitution? Even if you think she wants to take your guns she at least has never directly said she doesn't like the 2nd amendment. 

The list of real reasons could go on forever, but I have never met a Trump supporter willing to engage. I've only encountered white supremacists and people calling me a cuck. So really, I have good cause for my distaste of Trump supporters.  </TEXT>
