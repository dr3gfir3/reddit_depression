	<TEXT> When getting the blueprints for the Jetpack Booster Sigma, I thought that I might build them since I had what I needed.

I did and a few minutes later this little box showed up. 

I thought to myself "Ok, well maybe it didn't register that I crafted it before and went a loop around itself.".

But it won't go away, no matter what I do. I can craft 10 Carite Sheets and craft the mod, but nothing happens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as I agree with what Bill Sherrill, I don't agree with the "it's anti capitalistic". The reason why it still is as it is, is because of gigantic companies like AB InBev that has the huge amount of money that they can spend on making sure that they are the ones making the most money, not the little ones. Anti entrepreneur, yes. Anti capitalist? No, not really.

	<TEXT> Well, to be honest - more than two thirds of adult american are considered overweight to obese, a third of the adult american population is considered obese and one in every 20 adult person in america is considered "extremely obese". When talking about children one in every three kid is considered overweight and one in every six is considered obese. So assuming that americans are fat isn't really "uneducated".

But then again, this is, as you pointed out, not an average body. It's hot as hell.

	<TEXT> I worked at a store that sold espresso machines, spare parts, accessories for the machines and so on. It's a small store with a loyal group of customers, so I recognize our regulars.

One day, an old man walks into the store. I say hello and ask if I can help him.


Customer: "Yes! I am looking for a part for my machine!"

Me: "Alright! What machine is it?"

C: "It's a **brand** and I need a **part**

M: "Hmm, I don't think we have any of those parts. Let me check.

I check the cupboards behind the counter and find nothing.

M: "Let me just ask my manager."

I go back, ask him about and get the answer that we do not sell them anymore.

M: "I'm sorry, sir, but we don't sell those anymore."

C: "What do you mean 'you don't sell them anymore'?"

M: "Well, it means we don't sell them anymore. We can order the spare part for you if you want, but we don't have it in stock."

C: "That can't be possible! You've always had it in stock! I but it here all the time!"

M: "When was the last time you bought it, sir?"

C: "Three years ago!" </TEXT>
