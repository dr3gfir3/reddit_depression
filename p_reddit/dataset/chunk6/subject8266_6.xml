There's a lot of pushback and a lot of superior-sounding "I only read quality books race and gender don't factor for me."

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm always engaging in longer term reading list. Last few years, I've been trying to read the [Booker Longlists](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/102225.Man_Booker_2016_Longlist_) before the awards are announced. Now, I'm going back and trying to read all the books from all the longslits since they started announcing them in 2007. Same for the [National Book Awards](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/103864.2016_National_Book_Award_for_Fiction_Longlist), but they've only done it since 2013. There's also the [Pulitzer Finalists](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/91326.Pulitzer_Prize_Nominees_for_Fiction_2010), but I've only gone as far back as 2010. I don't like this as much since they don't announce the list until *after* it's awarded...takes the participatory nature out of it.
