	<TEXT> Don't believe I said it was. Very well aware of Aechemenid and Sassanian history.

My point is that there seem to be historically lots of Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians there - even now. 

How do you explain that if they were forced to convert?

How did he have any lands to conquer or people to convert if this is how Islam spread?

He was 1100 years too late!

	<TEXT> No, I don't think Shah really 'did' academia lol. Though he was a graduate of Oxford. 

I did Islamic Studies to postgrad and had access to a lot of source material. I would say that the Sufi stories (as opposed to his talks and lectures say) are exactly the same and original. 

Some academics claim he just stole them but he didn't claim to write them - he just translated them. So if they criticise Shah's output in that regard they are criticising Sufi tradition in a way.

Books like "The Sufis" they don't like because it makes claims they think can't be proved - Witches and Sufism, Zen and Sufism, Freemasonry etc. 

But I would just read them (the stories) they've been passed down for 1000s of years and, in a way, Shah's status is irrelevant if you accept the Sufis had wisdom. 

As the Sufis say: The canal brings water but does not itself drink. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  By killing those that don't convert and kidnapping their children to brainwash them. If you don't understand that perhaps a talk with some native americans will change that.

I've chatted to some - they seem to mention this thing called 'Genocide' - I don't recall any of them being enthusiastic Christians though. Which is good because the reason for my chats was about their own religion which they still seemed to practice.

I'd probably pretend, yes. And more then likely future generations would do more then pretend.

Holy mother of fuck. Maybe you should get some principles? You know, like the Christians getting slaughtered right now... don't see them pretending. 

You have less reason to than them in your own view - you think you have 'The Truth' and they don't. What happened to preserving **THAT**? 

Who the fuck said that? Please don't put words in my mouth,.

Not putting anything in your mouth. If I did there's a prefix **"IF"** so it would be a quite safe practice.

I know for you there is no "IF" but it revolves just the same. 

Peace treaties with tributes and taxes forced upon penalty of death.

So to paraphrase: your explanation of why there are still Christians and Jews when you claim they all converted and should be none is taxes. 

Who is levying the taxes now? 

Right. Atheist logic lol.

**Everyone was forced to convert to Islam**

*Err, I can see large groups of Jews, Christians and others who've survived for 1000s of years*

**They had to pay taxes and made peace treaties**

*Err.... so they WEREN'T forced to convert then?*

Also btw, the Qur'an and specifically Muhammad's Medina Charter (first ever written Constitution btw) forbid forced conversion - so there's that.

	<TEXT> **Quick question:** How is it possible to 'spread by the sword'? 

If someone came up to you with a sword and told you to convert you'd do it?

Do we have to worry about you in case ISIS make it this far? You're going to convert when they tell you?

And THEN you're going to join all the others who do the same and jet off converting others?

Yikes... not sure what's more scary, this fact (if it is one) about how people are or the ideas you have about history (if it's false).

**Bonus question:** how do you explain the existence of the other religions in Islamic cultures if 'the sword' was used to convert them all?

I am referring to the Christians throughout the Middle East even today (you might remember ISIS has started killing them so that kind of proves they exist), Jews in Iran etc.

Were the swordsmen just, like, *really bad with swords?* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a student. I know where that rumour came from (at least the MI5 thing) and who initiated it. 

Interestingly, this rumour was not initially about Shah but about another individual (whom I knew very well) who had been a personal student of Gurdjieff and who may well have been Shah's teacher (imo) and at the very least was not a student but a partner of Shah's. 

The PsyOp thing is said about everything these days. I'm at the point where I think the *claims* of PsyOps are more like to PsyOps - trust me, those who have the 'Intel/Govt' mindset are far, far less awake in general than the average guy in the street.

I know many of the people who contributed to the Wiki. At least one is clinically mentally ill. The academics (James Moore, if you can call him that, and Elwell-Sutton) who opposed Shah hated him for a very specific reason which is really quite trivial.  </TEXT>

I hope. I believe in the old days (lol) there was a more enlightened spirit of debate... no less passionate, maybe more, but certainly both sides respected each other more. Or was it just respecting themselves more?

I'd definitely be more generous than that.

Maybe. Depends what demographic you mix with. I am told I'm a heretic and have 'left Islam' by some Muslims as much as I'm called a retard by some atheists.

	<TEXT> So is atheism the problem or is it "New Atheism"?

Neither... thought the title was pretty clear no? What does it say? I'll repost it:

**Reductionist Literalism and not Religion or Atheism is the Problem.**

You get it?

Plenty of atheists are perfectly capable of understanding nuance and are willing to accept that Islam, like other religions, has some good ideas.

Yep, met one or two in this thread. I really appreciate them. amazing guys and hope to talk more. I don't decry them though when we look at what percentage they constitute.... is less than 1 isn't it? 

Why is that?

You could say that in Islam it's less than 1. You may be right even. But in the main most don't value that 1% of Muslims. I REALLY value the 1% of atheists that are rational and cool guys.

You'll find us less willing to have that conversation if you insist there are no bad ideas in Islam though, since there obviously are.

Wouldn't know about that as I didn't - and wouldn't - say any such thing. I guess you're confusing me with someone else so can't really comment on that.  </TEXT>

After all the debates, all the arguments, all the philosophising - thousands of years of trying to work it all out and all the rationalist humanist tradition... all the claims to great thought and logic which you so obscenely lay claim to, all the rational analysis - all that did it in the end was the penetrating pinnacle of human intellectual achievement:

*I have lost my atheism! Allahu Ackbar! PBUH! PBUHHHHH!!!*

My only regret is that Socrates, Nietzsche, Voltaire and Descartes weren't here to witness your triumph and pay you homage. 

You truly are a collossus among men - there won't be a Muslim, Christian and Jew left believing by the time this hits the internets.

You won. You did it. For us all. If I wasn't a newly minted atheist I'd go as far as to say you're our very own personal Saviour Jesus.

	<TEXT> I can't really explain to you the academic arguments if you're not interested enough to keep up with ongoing debates in a field you claim to be interested in.

It would be a waste of my time. But look on the bright-side - you get to be insulting and claim there *ARE* no such debates between atheist academics and Religious Studies departments in this very area.

I guess my mistake was in assuming that atheists would - by default - know of the latest research and discussions.

I think I was disabused of that notion by around Reply #5. 

But as I say, just claim there is not such thing happening - "stop lying" usually works - and we're all good.

Then along come atheists who not only *ALSO* believe that WE believe it (hilarious!) but they claim to be rational while doing it (hysterical!) and then don't listen when you logically point out their error! Then they keep repeating it!

We're laughing all right! At **YOU**!

	<TEXT> I don't believe in magic yet here you are saying you do. People clearly believe in irrational things

The only difference between me and you is that you feel entitled to feel superior and downgrade what I believe while I accept your belief is valid for you. Works better for me.. but it is significant nonetheless. 

So why is it hard to fathom that suicide bombers that blow up with smiles on their faces are doing so out of their belief?

Did not say it was hard to fathom. I just don't believe it is the case. 

Would you say that Western troops - say - on a mission from which they will not return are doing so out of belief? I'd think you'd be wrong. I'd think there would be something you are blind to. I'd think you don't understand the power of a cause or what one feels, rightly or wrongly, is a 'just war'.

Even kamikazes would die for their nation because they believed it was for a good cause.

Exactly. I think you just kamikazied your own foot. 

EDIT: Actually maybe it is because you believe in magic you struggle to see how irrational beliefs can hurt people. 

Or maybe it is because you are blind to the magical elements of life you despise those that are not so vehemently and why you fight so strongly to assert you 'rightness'. Perhaps you are like the guy who never really went on the Gold Rush but is so eaten with the possibility that they might be made to look a fool by someone striking it rich that all they can ever think of or do is to 'prove' no gold exists to all the others who were too lazy, scared or 'rational' to set out on such quest to risk it all..... endless talking with all the other life-deniers, **TO** all the other life-deniers, vainly bolstering each other and giving each other succour before the grim hand of death blows the whistle on what you - and only you and your kind -are so convinced is all you have..... all you will ever have. 

I certainly hope you never promised someone you'd help them or cure them by waving a "magic" wand.

Lol.... careful, I might despatch something far more entertaining than a magic wand (come in Dr Freud) your way if I feel impish enough, ;)

	<TEXT> Now sadly this effects society as a whole. Which is why I don't encourage it. But people will put their beliefs in front of reality which is why we have sick things like suicide bombing.

Do you think it's that simplistic though? I know there's a trope about 72 virgins (not true btw) but no Muslim I ever met thinks that is what awaits us... and I have had thousands of discussions just on that topic alone.

When a kid believes in Santa Claus is 'proof' part of the equation? I think not. Perhaps you could argue 'trust' (in the parents) is and clearly for some a religious leader might be an analogue. But I think people mostly believe something because they *want* it to be true. That's just how they want to live. 

You might call it 'magical thinking'. But maybe that's just me... I could be an exception as I really do believe in magic although I no longer really practice it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the natural state of things is not believing until one has proof. 

This is getting kind of fruitless. I accept this is natural FOR YOU. You seem unable to accept that I don't work like that. I don't need proof to believe. It never crosses my mind. If it wasn't for debates with atheists I would never even consider anything remotely like it. 

As if I claim there is an invisible ghost goat stalking you all the time you will not say well I have no proof but until I can prove it wrong I'll believe it. 

I would say no such thing. For one thing, I am open to the possibility that ghosts (or other beings - not necessarily spirits of the dead) follow people round. If you told me this was so in my case I would not in the least ask for proof. I would assess you personally as to whether you were the sort of person who would be able to discern such a thing. 

Of course if it was **You** as you are now (ie an atheist) I would know you could not discern it so I would not believe. But there are people who I would believe it from and again, proof would not enter into the equation. 

Yet here you are with nothing but a claim, no proof believing there is a God. So why do you make an exception with in the case of a God believe?

Let's try this: do you accept that there are people who are so stupid (in your view) or so irrational (ditto) that their beliefs are not arrived at by logic? 

If you can grant that then perhaps - if it helps - you might envisage these people just 'feeling' something from some sort of emotional stance, trauma or just peer-pressure or whatever. 

If you can grant **THAT** then just assume I am one of them. 

Sorted! </TEXT>

I believe it is possible for you to be right that there is no God and me to be right that there is a God.

Does that clear it up?

Edit: re 'proof' - I don't feel any need to prove this nor do I have (necessarily) anybody having 'proved' it to me and caused that belief. It's not derived (again necessarily) from Qur'an as such but, obviously, I see no contradiction or I could not hold contradictory beliefs.

	<TEXT> No no, youre totally right. ISIS members arent true Muslims. You are though. Definitely.

Or maybe they are. Let's assume they are. You like to ask statements to be backed up by proof so show me how to do it.

ISIS are Wahabi which - you obviously know this, knowing all about Islam - arose as a sect in the 18th century.

The first question I suppose is - if they are the real Muslims as you claim - how does this work?

1200 years after Muhammad we get the true Muslims?

All the Muslims before that were following false Islam (including Muhammad) ok, but how does it work? How did they follow this false Islam till the truth of Wahabism turned up 1200 years later?

What's your take? Muhammad, Qur'an and all the previous teachings were false until 1800? Proof? Evidence?

Also what about now? There's 1.7 Billion Muslims. Probably less than a million are Wahabi. How does that work? 

Will the true Wahabi Islam eradicate the false 1.7 Billion? That's what ISIS believe and clearly you do too but they have no evidence at all... do you?

Everyone I know. 

Admittedly that might be WHY I know them and why I chose not to mix with people who don't.

I am quite prepared for example to admit that ISIS Head Command might not have the same view and they may give a fuck. To the extent they'd want to do some balance redressing... but then we're in the same boat there. They'd behead me way before you.

And in any case, I don't hold them to be religious in the least. You do presumably.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For epistemology, making a claim doesn't mean literally saying it out to others. It means having a proposition about the world you hold true. If they believe it is true, they are making a claim as to the state and nature of reality.

Why? I'm not. I've always seen things as a progression of positions I hold... I was brought up Christian - believed it. Then that evolved into a Nietzschean world-view for a while and on to Islam. 

May well be there's another stage down the line. None of them are a rejection of the previous one. Most people I know are the same.

In addition, saying 'you don't care' if others believe doesn't matter and generally isn't true.

It's not true for people who've over-invested in their chosen ideology but it's true for a lot of people. More than you think.

You have beliefs related to or conditional on your religious beliefs, which means that if you espouse and advocate those, people have good reason to question your core tenets. 

well, they feel like questioning them. It's all cool, they can... why not? Happens all the time. I don't mind. It just does not impact me or my belief at all. No connection. 

Claiming that you don't care what people believe and your religious belief doesn't impact your claims doesn't really fly given your arguments in a debate religion forum.

You don't know what my reasons are. In fact I only have one and if it gets fulfilled I'll be gone. 

I like talking philosophy but I limit myself here to redressing disinfo and misinfo re Islam and atheist misconceptions of religion generally.

My position is not to defend religion but to say rather: you are not attacking what religionists believe. You are attacking what you THINK they believe.

Once you start attacking what we actually believe and it's all rational and reasoned then I'll not be here. I have other things to do.

	<TEXT> What do you believe your religion teaches about the nature of reality and what evidence is available to confirm it?

Big question. 

I suppose it depends what you mean by Reality - Islam teaches about this in two specific regards:

1) The Natural world - ie observable phenomena... basically Science

2) The Spiritual world - ie Man's 'Inner Life' as a form of proto-psychology writ large as a system of ethics and primarily an answer to the question 'how should I live'? Basically Islamic philosophy.

We can summarise both briefly and pick up on any points arising:

1) I don't personally believe there is anything in Islam which conflicts with science of any time or place. The evidence I have for this is the long list of Scientific advances by individual muslims. 

As Muslims invented The Scientific Method (al-Haytham was the first to use experiment and observation as the basis of science - 10th century CE - also founded experimental psychology, and phenomenology) and employed it across the board then this should be the answer to this question of #1.

2) Is more tricky. I would make a distinction between 'what does the Qur'an teach' and 'what do Muslims believe'. In another sense, many 'Islamic traditions' come from elsewhere and can be proved to do so.

Veiling for example is an adoption from Christian nuns in the Middle East region. Stoning as a punishment is mentioned nowhere in Qur'an etc. 

Much of what passes for Islam today in the mind of the average Westerner is essentially Wahabism. Which is, more or less, the expression of a Saudi sect which is less than 1% of belief and which emerged around 200 years ago. It would have remained a small cult were it not for the discovery of oil on the region they occupied. Before that they were virtually unknown and very small tribal schismatic group. 

All verifiable. So we need to differentiate between that (ie the belief of the Sauds, Taleban, Daesh etc) and what is more normative mainstream belief. 

Of course it boils down to this: God is unknowable. In fact He is the only thing that really exists. Everything else will pass away - He will not. The thing that will not pass away when all else has we call 'God'.

This 'God' sends Revelations to various people at various times. They are meant to be understood sometimes literally and sometimes metaphorically. 

This God and this way of living do not require anything to be proved to anyone. If you choose to disbelieve it on any grounds - whether because of lack of 'proof' or any other reason - you are free to do so and it's all cool.

	<TEXT> Thanks man, I appreciate the support. The most annoying thing about this issue is that it kind of forces you to be the person you don't want to be: a prostletyser for a religion.

That's the last thing I am or want to be in any sense - to me, I believe we all have our own Truth for ourselves and our only duty is to find it, could be atheism for one guy, Buddhism for another - but when something is not factually correct you need to point it out. That's the point at which you run into the issue... you get forced into a box you're not in.

It seems that many people can't extend things that they agree do and should apply to their group (context, wide range of opinions, non-generalisations etc) to their nominal opponents. 

If you're not on one side or the other you get stuck in the middle being shot at by both sides. I've had exactly the same criticisms - exactly the same minus the atheist context - shot at me by hardcore conservative Muslims. 

Still... there's always hope right? 

As an aside: I think the internet has a lot to do with this trend... it's kind of empowered laziness of thought.

	<TEXT>  What I'm saying is that whether or not their behaviour is unislamic in your opinion doesn't mean that it actually is.

No, and likewise whether or not their behaviour is Islamic in your opinion doesn't mean that it actually isn't.

But surely a Muslim who has studied Islam in depth for decades is more likely to be correct in this context than an atheist who hasn't studied it at all. Don't you think? Wait... no, don't answer that, we'll call it rhetorical. 

No, because atheism holds no tenets on which you can base that plan. Unlike Islam.

This is what I'm talking about. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. You're very, very wrong. 

Q: What makes someone a Muslim?

A: Subscribing to the *Shahada* - that's it. Nothing else. Believe that and you're a Muslim period. Regardless of whatever else you may or may not believe. 

Q: what is *Shahada*?

A: "There is no God........... except God. And Muhammad is a Prophet of God"

Here btw, God can also mean 'Reality' or even 'Truth'.

So... no tenets. 

Just as your atheist comparison, this one doesn't hold up. Vegetarianism is a single stance on a single issue. It's not open to interpretation. Unlike Islam. One can find justification for pretty much anything in the Qu'ran.

Well we just knocked down your above fallacy so this kind of falls on its own. Actually this is really a bit embarrassing... 

*It's not open to interpretation.*

It's **TOTALLY** open to interpretation!!!!!! That's why you can have ISIS in one corner and RUMI on the other both reading *the exact same thing*!!!

And worse (for you) Qur'an ITSELF States it is a matter of interpretation and has many levels of meaning! It states it is metaphor in many places which you have to INTERPET!!

Your opinion on what is and isn't Islamic is of equal value to the opinion of someone who disagrees with you.

No, it is of no value to you but you are - no disrespect - not significant in as much as you have no real interest in the issue... it is just a by-product of your agenda which your agenda dictates you address. 

I am an academic in this field and debate with people who disagree on all these matters continually. Sometimes they are even right and I concede the points and learn something. The difference between you and them though is that they know the subject inside out and don't make silly rookie mistakes. 

I know nothing of evolutionary biology but the same thing would happen to me if I tried to take on Dawkins in that area just because I want to oppose atheism. 

It also doesn't help that those you disagree with can often explain their ideas and actions by pointing at verses in the Qu'ran.

Well again, a bit silly. If I was to show now the famous Sam Harris texts about torture and the right to kill you would no doubt cite 'context'. Let me know if you wouldn't because I'd love that. 

If I asked you why the British are commanded to fight Germans on beaches and showed you Churchill quotes to prove it then you would not concede the point. The question is more properly "What mechanism allows you to claim context in every situation, even modern ones, but not in historical documents over 1000 years old?"

What Islam is is what it's adherents make of it.

Wait... so it IS subject to interpretation now??? Earlier you said this:

*It's not open to interpretation.*

????

Yeah, let's grab the facts, let's see how the numbers actually stack up.

1.6 Billion Muslims

Number of extremist Islamist groups in Iraq/Syria: around 100

Number of confirmed Muslims *from Europe* who have gone to fight with one of these 100 factions in last 15 years: 5000

Number of confirmed Muslims *from US* who have gone to fight with one of these 100 factions in last 15 years: 12 (FBI) 

There have been around 140,000 terror attacks committed worldwide since 1970. Assuming - for argument's sake - 100% of these attacks were by Muslims. That works out at  0.00009% of Muslim population. 

No. There's no such thing as 'true Islam', it's all opinions.

So you've shifted your argument from "Islam is ISIS" to "Islam is nothing.. just many opinions". But none of them are valid. Ok... got that. It's the old "I don't know what it is but I don't need to because it's crap" line. Ok. 

But just as you're probably not interested in hearing why Islam is bullshit, I really don't care about the opinions of Muslims on what is and isn't Islamic. 

Lol, I really honestly wrote my last comment to your quote **BEFORE** I read this!!!! I am just too good sometimes. Or you're too predictable... I think that's more likely. Lol.

Would love to hear your response if I said "Atheism is what I say it is... I am not interested in what an atheist says it is!". 

Thanks for the laugh at the end... it was all getting a bit philosophical I agree!

I have no shortage of articles to read about Islam from all other angles - I'm an academic in a related field so that's not the issue. Just wondered if you knew of any atheist-specific ones as I don't.

So we seem to be at the point where there are no articles of that nature by atheists - or at least I don't know any and you can't point me to any - but I'm not allowed to say so as it would be generalising.

	<TEXT>  The point of bringing that up is to show you maybe you can change your thinking on the question. I look at the existence of god the same way I look at the existence of dragons. Seems like I'm being consistent.

Actually seems like you're being irrational. A dragon - if it were to exist - would be of the order of 'existent things' and therefore, were GOD to exist alongside the dragon, in your argument God would be a 'created thing'. 

Which is nothing to do with anything as no religion ever believed God is a 'created thing' - He would be the creator of the dragons and therefore or a different order of things. 

What you are saying is that both dragons and God are of the same order of things - which to you they are, ie you think they are both 'made up', that's why you compare them... so this is circular reasoning.

Yes, that was my point, just as there is a 'New Atheism' there are equivalent 'New Islamisms' and Christianity. And then there's the Alt-Right. 

yet people that subscribe to the more hardline anti-theistic/anti-religious 'New Atheism' (another horrible term) is not really that big.

Yes, I agree. We have the same problem if you set aside the religious context: the most rabid and vocal element will, if they claim to be the 'true voice', be assumed to be so by those not involved in the wider group or knowledgeable about it.

	<TEXT> Reductionist, reductionist, reductionist...

Question for you. Do you think things exist in the abstract? I mean is there such a thing as a 'dog'? Or would someone be reductionist in identifying a being and applying that label?

How about with ideological positions? Is there such a thing as a 'Muslim'? A 'racist'? A 'Republican'?

If someone says - for example - 'I believe in God' can we then call them a believer? Or do we have to not say that as it's reductionist and say instead "Mr X claims to believe in God"?

Because that could get kind of tedious. This is probably the only time in my life I've actually **HOPED** someone's just trying to win a cheap point.

I'd say that evidence of this is lacking. 

Yes, in your terms definitely. Non-existent even. It must be so. 

Thus far, I don't think that you've really given an analysis of anything, you've just presented a bunch of your reductionist views as if they were facts.

Is there a playbook for this or is it just coincidence that every time someone posts (say) on 'Subject X' then the more militant opposers accuse that person of suffering from 'Subject X'.

When they post on 'Subject Y' - even tangentially - then the counter is 'typical response of Y'. 

I find that odd. And also highly suggestive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But seriously, you saying ISIS and Wahabism being 'unislamic' has the same worth of them calling you 'unislamic'. Essentially nothing.

If I wanted to stop any reasonable debate I could just play that card too re your reply and move on. Luckily for you (or maybe not) I don't think your post is 'essentially nothing'. Not that this will change anything but I continue...

It's all about what they claim to support. If they claim Islam, and do horrible things in the name of Islam (which is in fact supported by the Qu'ran. And before you ask, yes, I have read it, and yes, it was in Arabic.) then it is meaningless to say what they do is 'unislamic'.

So if I start an 'atheist militia' and start chopping people's heads off for being religious it's going to mean you need to start answering some tough questions right? 

I don't think so - very surprised you would. In my view it would have *nothing to do with you* because, as they say, "that's not how it works". I can call myself a vegetarian and stuff BigMacs 24/7. It matters not. Labels still mean *SOMETHING*

But thanks for bringing this up - I mean that - as I was going to touch on this in my OP but thought I'd waffled enough.... the related concept of "REBRANDING* things - not only to be their opposite (always a good one) but also to instil the view that the label is the definition and not the actuality. It used to be that the 'thing itself' was the benchmark of what it is... now that doesn't matter at all... it's just the concensus of *what it is needed to be seen as* by whoever's agenda is in play.

If it looks like a duck, feels like a duck and also claims to be a duck, I'm going to accept it's a duck. Even if a lot of other birds are telling me it's quacking is 'unducklike'.

That's my point. You're not. Not remotely. With a duck you know what a duck is. With Islam you know what the consensus in your peer-group SAY Islam is. 

So:

*If it looks like what my position needs Islam to be, feels like what my position needs Islam to be, I'm going to it's Islam. Even if every Muslim on earth tells me its total negation of everything they ever believed or taught is 'unIslamic'.*

In short: there are probably less than 0.0001% of Muslims who hold Islamist or extremist views and a vast majority of the remainder who oppose them. 

Whenever you encounter one of these vast majority - and we can actually break this down with figures if you want - you insist, without knowing what the majority think re Islamism/Extremism, that this 0.0001% is in fact the 'correct version' and the millions and millions of Muslims who oppose them are wrong.

How they *could* be wrong - and wrong for 1400 years till Daesh turned up with the TRUE ISLAM - does not interest you in the least apparently.

	<TEXT> My view is that at the end of the day we are all humans and we must strive to become better humans. Let`s take time out from debating each other to unite under the banner of humanity which I believe is crucial for healthy coexistence.

My take exactly. Unfortunately we have a lot of work to do to find the method of doing that while allowing people to hold opposing beliefs. 

I tend to suspect the problem is not in the beliefs (or non-beliefs or lack of beliefs I need to also add here for our atheists friends) but the degree to which the individual is *identified* with the belief (or lack of) in terms of their own self-ideation. The more identification and the less detachment the more likely they are to be hyper-sensitive regarding their position and be pre-disposed to see any debate as a personal attack. 

Stage 1 is to get to the point where we can all be in the same room together. We're decades off that at the very least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure I understand this argument, if the atheist sees something they can't explain, they investigate it, or say they don't know what happened. You'd only ask for evidence if someone else is making a claim about something and you can't investigate it yourself.

In theory but my point is they don't ever consider options which are out of current knowledge do they? 

Parapsychology is a scientific field which DOES try to do this but it is also under attack by materialists who downcry it. I would have thought they would support it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I respect your post and appreciate the time you've taken to answer sincerely I think there's a slight problem in the use of the term 'delusions' here. 

It's ok to think that someone is deluded - I think it about atheists a lot lol - but if debate is the goal then it kind of gets things off on the wrong foot. Not for me, I don't personally care or get offended by it, I'm just saying. Religionists do it too all the time.

But to your main point as that's just in passing: I think the thing about 'the Book' being the 'bad' thing in the mix is the exact opposite for me. Cat Stevens was in hospital after a crash and it so happened all he had to read was the Qur'an. So he read it and that's why he converted. He later said that he had never met a Muslim at that point and if he had known the ones he later met before reading Qur'an he never would have converted. That's exactly how I feel. It seems the opposite of your position in a way.

I think this is also a lot of the problem - people judge Qur'an almost exclusively from a highly conditioned context (currently that would be Islamophobic, Right-wing and Fundie Christian propaganda) and not from what it actually is. And they don't even see their conditioned bias.

I grew up in a Fundie Xian environment and know very many of the 'movers and shakers' even now. You'd better believe they are political and have propaganda outlets you probably aren't remotely aware of. 

My point in saying that is, because of this, I am able to trace a lot of the memes against Islam - which range from falsities to misunderstandings to outright lies - to this source. It seems odd to see atheists (not you) employing them as ammo sometimes because:

a) they are Christian propaganda and

b) they are so transparently erroneous in many cases that it is embarrassing. 

One of the great things atheist and humanist thought (and there are many great things) has at its core which I wish religion would also adopt more, is the commitment to rigorous analysis and a search for truth and facts Unfortunately (and this was the theme of my OP) it seems often to be mere lip-service these days. Where IS the rigorous dissection?

Many humanists often say they agree with the ideal "I disagree with you but will defend your right to say it" but I think allegiance to *facts* is far more important.

I would love to see atheist articles taking down lies and disinfo about Islam - not because they want to support Islam but because they are wedded to Truth and the principles of Research.

All too often though it's more a case of: 'this is good ammo - that will make a big bang!' regardless of facts.

	<TEXT>  I have never seen a miracle, I HAVE seen people witness something they don't understand and call it a miracle.

Exactly my position. 

Of course my categories would be broader than yours I expect: I would say this to someone who had seen a ghost for example. I would expect you would just say 'ghosts don't exist'. 

The difference appears to be that when religionists see 'something they don't understand' which probably utilises as yet undiscovered laws, they shout **"it's a miracle!"** because they can't say *"well we don't know what this is yet but there it is"*.

When atheists see 'something they don't understand' which probably utilises as yet undiscovered laws, they shout **"show me the evidence or it didn't happen!"** because they can't say *"well we don't know what this is yet but there it is"*.

I guess neither side are comfortable not knowing. Even just for now.

	<TITLE> Reductionist Literalism and not Religion or Atheism is the Problem. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-12 11:50:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's my theory: Over the course of this century and in the run up to the Millennium, we have entered a cyclic period where everything is reduced to a paradigm of either/or and black/white reductionist 'thought'. Literalism is a side effect of this and it is a cancer that has infected Humanist thought and religious thought equally. 

I would cite the rise of Islamic 'fundamentalism' (the wrong word because a true fundamentalist would be a very different beast but more of that later) as a *by-product* of this (ie not a cause) just as much as I would US Exceptionalist policies as a similar by-product. 

Perhaps Bush's "You're with us or against us" meme is the key leitmotif here. 

Here's some pertinent examples: I argue myself often against irrationality and I target my own chosen belief-system more than anything else both here and elsewhere. I can point out the errors of Daesh and Wahabism till the cows come home. Nothing gives me greater pleasure (almost lol) than to stick it to these idiots.

But, here's the kicker: when I do that with an atheist they are generally so wedded to the idea of "Islam bad" (substitute 'religion' or 'Abrahamic' here if you need to) that they seem to interpret my defence of Islam in showing that (say) Daesh are unIslamic as an attack on their own position. 

In other words they cannot join with me in attacking certain Islamic views because in doing so I am necessarily showing they are NOT really Islamic views. I am not attacking Islam to refute Islam but attacking Daesh for not upholding Islam. So in a way to agree with me (to them) means supporting a religious view.

This is reductionist thought.

But there's more. An unavoidable concomitant of this 'thought' process is to fail to discern what Islam (or religion in the abstract) really is. It's 'bad' so it can all go in the 'Bad Corner' - we don't need to know in what ways the 'badness' manifests. We would only need to do that if we were open to there not being 'bad' involved or we were looking for something 'good'. Which of course we're not. 

I can virtually guarantee that this post will be treated in the same way. 

It's no coincidence that the 'New Atheism' is nothing like the Old School and contains bigots like Sam Harris who, were they to arise in any other context, would be classed as a fundie nutter. It's reactionary and has nothing to do with a search for truth. If it did I might be tempted to even hitch a ride as a fellow traveller but alas, 'tis impossible. 

Tl;dr atheists have in theory common cause with many progressive believers and those believers are disposed to work with atheists on many issues but it's not happening and I think we know why. Because atheists have more in common as a demographic with the conservative religionists the progressive believers are fighting.

Exactly. Every monotheistic tradition has its own inner mystical core which simultaneously IS the religion.

Christianity certainly does and Islam has Sufism (which is believed to have heavily influenced the development of Zen btw) which is very similar in many respects.

Of course there IS a deviated fundie Islam too, we know that. But you'd think that people could use logic and see past it. Seems not.

Atheism is really missing the boat as to what it could be on another note. It could really serve as an antidote to all sorts of BS in the world but it doesn't seem able to actually find the leaders who could do that. When you boil it down it's subject to exactly the same biases, prejudices and misogony as everything else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> because in the West we currently see them as the only ones being so radicalized.

We SEE that but it's not what's happening.

Islamic Extremism is (currently) feeding off US wars and foreign-policy giving rise to terrorist groupings - some of whom are funded by the West. And so the cycle goes.

As these groups commit more and more atrocities - and as the West creates the conditions for their growth more - then the boot will be on the other foot - ie just as the terror groups are a reaction in part against the West's actions so will there arise Western groups in response to Islamist actions.

We're seeing it already but they have not yet had their 9/11. When they do it will be full circle. 

Remember before 9/11 there was years of Islamist groups under the radar. I think we're maybe a year off some Western militia doing something somewhere. But they do not have any State funding as Daesh and Taleban have occasionally had from the West and Saudi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, many Muslims don't believe in evolution but there are many literalists out there. Qur'an kind of suggests it also imo.

Here's one Muslim thinker Al-Jahiz (781-869 CE) in 'The Book of Animals':

"Animals engage in a struggle for existence; for resources, to avoid being eaten and to breed. Environmental factors influence organisms to develop new characteristics to ensure survival, thus transforming into new species. Animals that survive to breed can pass on their successful characteristics to offspring."

Ibn Khaldun - 'The Muqadimmah' (1377 CE)

"One should then take a look at the world of creation. It started out from the minerals and progressed, in an ingenious, gradual manner, to plants and animals. The last stage of minerals is connected with the first stage of plants, such as herbs and seedless plants. The last stage of plants, such as palms and vines, is connected with the first stage of animals, such as snails and shellfish. The animal world then widens, its species become numerous, and, in a gradual process of creation, it finally leads to man, who is able to think and reflect. The higher stage of man is reached from the world of monkeys, in which both sagacity and perception are found..."

The poet Rumi also has a poem about it - along the same lines.

In some way it doesn't matter does it? I mean it's a moot point because if the archetype of the 'holy man' or Jesus-figure exists (and it does) then it doesn't matter WHO they project it on to does it?

If it wasn't Jesus it would be someone else. 

The concept is an archetype and is far older than Christianity. I'd see far more mileage in arguing that it was just morphed on to a historical figure... claiming he did not exist runs into far more problems. </TEXT>

I shall content myself with some quotes - I won't attribute them because that's more fun for me - and that is in short supply on this sub:

The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that what is impenetrable for us really exists and manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are intelligible to our poor faculties  this knowledge, this feeling . . . that is the core of the true religious sentiment. In this sense, and in this sense alone, I rank myself among profoundly religious men.

Atheism is so senseless   odious to mankind that it never had many professors."

Nirvana is a state of pure blissful knowledge It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two Is are identical namely when one disregards all special contents  their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier........

The MU hypothesis - along with large areas of Quantum Physics - are intrinsically 'mystical'. I am not saying supernatural but it is a nearer step to some sort of overlap.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you accept the good ones then?

In theory. Much atheist response seems polemical to me. Which is fine, nothing wrong with that but there's a hell of a lot of special-pleading to wade through and in general I don't often run into an atheist with the same detachment that I have re their world-view.

For example, I can think right now of about 3 pretty hard to counter arguments against Islam. I have never yet heard one of them advanced by an atheist. I think that's because they don't feel it necessary to go far enough into a study of Islam to know what they are, in part anyway.

So that's problem #1.

These issues ARE discussed by muslim thinkers and there's lots of debate and dissension - has been for centuries. I enjoy that. But we never really get that deep.... and then the arguments are that we don't have to! 

So that's problem #2. 

If an atheist - who would probably have to be an ex-muslim I guess (though often these guys are even more literalist and that's what they think Islam is and what they are rejecting) - were to start discussing them in an objective manner I'd be up for it. 

I don't see a similar open attitude in most atheists. That would be problem #3 and that's way enough.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think so. This is a common misconception that religious people have.

It's not one that I have. I'm not referring to leaders or religious thought. Just that someone you regard now as 'rational' - something which you also lay claim to - could suddenly start acting, based on the same history of reasoning, as 'irrational'.

If tomorrow, it came out that the Prophet was shown to have been insane, it would make some question whether the Quran was truly divinely inspired.

Would it? Long tradition of the mad having a direct link to God in Islam and also in Eastern Christianity. Rasputin and the 'Holy Fools' are examples of this. Diogenes was another one now I come to think of it.

But there is no 'authority' in atheism.

Funny, there is no 'authority' in Islam either. This bit: "There are prominent thinkers, but they are no more an authority than I am." could be a purely Islamic concept. Actually it is.

 It is a presentation of evidence, and that evidence would still exist even if Dawkins was shown to be insane. 

 It is a presentation of evidence, and that evidence would still exist even if Dawkins was shown to be insane. 

Strange, I have read his books and see no evidence presented. It's basically all polemic. 

 In much the same way that Isaac Newton spending his last years trying to turn lead into gold using mystic techniques doesn't take away from his work on physics

Kind of adds to it to me! Lol! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What you or I believe about reality isn't relevant whatsoever to actual reality.

Good. I like that. But why then - given that my view of reality is different - to anti-religionists bring it up all the time as an argument?

Whatever way you wrap it you ARE saying your view on reality is correct.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Then they aren't miracles.

I think what are called 'miracles' and even magic utilise currently unknown natural laws. So yes, miracles as such don't exist in that sense.

Strangely, whenever I say this I get opposed in exactly the same way as if I had said I DO believe in the Supernatural explanation. Odd.

	<TEXT> If my not accepting the existence of Jesus as established fact is too big of a hurdle for you then, yeah, it's a waste of time.

Well, it might be a way of passing time for you, granted. But, in an academic context with money and actual facts at stake, yeah, it's a waste of time. 

Why don't you just declare that your god exists and that that can't be discussed and you can go retire victorious.

I do declare that. I rarely discuss my views on God. I prefer to focus on other's arguments against it that don't quite make the grade.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really is.  And worse, it is indicative of a massive failure of imagination. 

You could dispose of every religion ever conceived of and prove them all false and you still would not have made the slightest impact on the question of whether or not God exists. 

In fact, the constant Aunt-Sally attacks on religion can really (in this context) be only one of two things:

1) based on an assumption that to disprove a given religion is to disprove God (God I hope not... please don't let it be this)

2) a diversion from addressing the main issue of God and pretending that you've got somewhere by proving some moronic religionists wrong (I call this the "Real Madrid vs Under-10 Boy Scouts C team match-up" with the added shameful disgrace that not only do RM score 100 goals they claim that this proves they've won the Champions League)
