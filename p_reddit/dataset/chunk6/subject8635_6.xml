	<TEXT> Leah did this weird thing today  she made lunch.  Thats twice in one week now, and I really think she might be poisoning me.  Stronger coffee, saltier quiche  fuck, I didnt know anything about poison, and I didnt know what it tasted like either!  

She makes these sandwiches where she toasts the bread, and then on the bread?  Cold slices, bacon, avocado, feta cheese, mozzarella, pickles, cucumbers  The whole thing was supposed to make me feel better after my pitbull died.  Mary didnt say anything about Spot, and I ended up burying Spot in the backyard.  My dogs throat had been slit  her white fur was matted around her neck.  I heaved when I picked her stiff body up, my heart broke.

Mary is talking to me again.  The fact that I had accused Leah of animal murder was a bit much.  But but I didnt know anymore.  Leah kept appearing out of nowhere.  The first night in the hallway, last night outside.  And she wasnt even wearing the same clothes!

What whats happening to me?  I was told not eat Leahs food, and I didnt.  But good lord, how that turned out!

Daddy always does this! Leah sobbed in the kitchen to her mother. I cant get angry when he makes his stupid, fucking jokes!  I am not allowed to get angry!

Honey, calm down, maybe hes just not in the mood Mary tried, she always tried to keep the peace between Mary and me.

Well I dont care! Leah screamed, and I felt her glare on me.  She stalked to me, and the image I saw was identical to the one Id seen when shed told me that she hated her father. YOU!  You get mad at every little thing.  You get mad at me putting a towel on the door handle, because you think that I think you are a fucking pervert.  And now you refuse to eat my food?

Tears were glinting in her eyes.  

You know what?  I am DONE.  I wont protect your precious little feelings anymore.  Im leaving.

Where will you go? Mary demanded, suddenly furious, What will you do?

Anywhere is better than here.

She stormed out.  Not long after I heard her car start and she left.  Mary looked at me, her eyes closed in frustration.

Why didnt you just eat the food? She sighed and left me alone.  I sat there  I had no idea what to do.

I followed Mary to our bedroom. Why are you blaming me for this?

Are you serious right now? Mary barked at me, I know Spots death is sad.  But why did you say Leah did it?  Why did you say shes acting strange?  And why did you refuse to eat the food?

I had no answers.  Instead I just lied down on the bed and closed my eyes.  What else could I do?

I dreamt.  That was what I did.  It wasnt just a normal dream  it was a dream of my stepdaughter, Leah.

The dream was full of sweat, screams and begging.  

Please, daddy, Leah begged when I was shaking her again, Daddy, daddy, daddy stop!  

I didnt stop.  I just kept shaking her.  Her head fell off, a bloody neck all remaining.  Her arms were shaken off too, and then she fell apart, piece by piece until all I was holding was two upper arms.  Then it wasnt her arms anymore, but it was Spots head.

I jerked awake.  It was dark.  Id probably slept through the day.  I rolled around, expecting to see Mary.  She wasnt there.  Neither was Boy.

Youre all alone. A voice said softly.  I nearly pissed myself. Sucks, doesnt it?  I recognized the voice as Leahs, but it was her angry voice.  Calm, collected  and terrifying. 

Why are you doing this to me? I demanded into the darkness. 

What am I doing?

Torturing me. It was the only word I could find to describe what she, or it, was doing to me. 

Im simply returning the favour, daddy, Her voice was sweet as she said this, You tortured me for years.  Since I was ten  you tortured me daily.  And I didnt know it was wrong.  And I didnt know how much how much you hurt me.  Until now.

Her voice took a turn for the dark as this was uttered.  I swallowed thickly.  What was going on with my daughter?

And, daddy, The voice came again, Wheres mummy?

I bolted upright.  I switched on the light and looked around.  Leah wasnt there.

Oh, you wont find me, daddy.  Her disembodied voice said. Now  go find mummy.  Times ticking.

I surged upright, my heavy stomach protesting at the sudden movement, and I walked as fast as I could on gout-ridden feet through the house.

Mary?  I started softly.  When she didnt answer, I panicked. MARY!

She wasnt in the guest room just outside our bedroom.  She wasnt in Leahs old bedroom.  She wasnt in the living room, kitchen or crafts room.  My heart pounded loudly in my ears, and I heard nothing.  All I was aware of was the loud thump, thump, thump of my heart that overrode all of my senses.

I bolted into the other guest room, the one that we didnt use except when Leahs elder brother came to visit, and I found her.

I sighed in relief.

Mary, you wont believe what I-

But she didnt move when I turned the light on.  She was lying on her stomach  and Mary hated sleeping on her stomach.  Boy was licking her face, small yowls escaping his mouth.  I rolled her over on her back and put my ear next to her mouth.  She was breathing, but only just.  On the bedside table stood a bottle of half-emptied pills.  I swiped the bottle and looked at it.  Sleeping pills.

I called an ambulance.  I tried to get a hold of Leah too.  She didnt answer.  I called from her mothers phone in the hopes that her mother would get her to pick up, but it didnt help either.  Finally I called Joe  Leahs boyfriend  and he answered.

Hello?

Joe, yes, Im looking for Leah.

Oh, its you. Joe said icily.  What do you want?

Its Mary, shes going to the hospital.

Mumll be fine. I heard Leah growl into the phone before she ended the call.  Was she honestly so angry with me that she would ignore her own mothers attempted suicide?
