	<TEXT> I had to google psychopath to see if I am one! No, definitely not. While I do suffer from a lack of empathy, I don't consider myself amoral. I have a moral code - I consider myself chaotic good. 

Psychotic depression doesn't have to do with amorality or empathy, it has to do with hallucinations and other psychoses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, DO I have a sex life.
**Friend here. I can vouch for this. ;)**

No, really. When I was younger I was fucking because of my psychosis, I was... converting? through sex. That's a good way to put it. At this point I fuck because of and in spite of my crazy. I can only get interested in someone sexually if they're at least somewhat neurotic. Mental illness is sexy.

Also I love "psycho-sex". I'm going to use that in the future. </TEXT>
