	<TEXT> Don Sweeney is the new GM of the Boston Bruins. Aside from him making Claude Julien wait while he decided his future he has made quite a bit of bone-headed moves in the last 48 hours.

First off he traded Dougie Hamilton (considered the future of the Bruins defense and one of the best young d-men in the league) to Calgary their 1st rd and two 2nd rd picks of this year. Why? Dougie wanted too much money.

Next he resigned Andy McQuaid to an extension with an AAV I believe of around $2.5mil.

Then he traded Milan Lucic to LA for Martin Jones, a prospect d-man and this years 1st rd pick. Noteworthy to add the Bruins retained salary on Lucic. 

Adding this together makes it questionable why the Bruins would trade Dougie and then re-sign a different defenseman and retain salary on Lucic. There was also a rumor floating around that Dougie only wanted $5.5mil per year, but not sure how reliable that is.

Onto the draft. With Boston having 3 consecutive first rd picks (13, 14, 15) there was speculation that they would use those in a trade with Arizona to move to 3rd and grab Noah Hanifin. That did not happen, and there was another rumor that the package Sweeney was offering Arizona had none of those picks in it, again not sure how reliable. With the three picks, Boston choose to keep all three and proceed to draft 3 players that were not even Top 20 in rankings, and I believe one was ranked low as 40th. These choices of course angered fans everywhere and turned the Bruins into the butt of the joke. Also something about a goalie in the 3rd round they could of easily gotten in the 6th or something.

That is basically it. I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd put Jarry over Murray. Jarry was talked about as a future NHL starter, while Murray was rarely noticed until he blew up this year. Murray had an incredible and historic run, but that was also behind arguably the best defense in the AHL.

I think they will both become great goalies but I'd still over Jarry over Murray, at least for right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So there was this kid that used to come to the gym about a year or two ago. I never saw him since then but he just returned yesterday. The thing is this kid has a fake leg right below the knee. 

Now when he used to come he only really did upper body, and maybe some single-leg calf raises. So I'm sitting on the bench and he comes in and walks straight over to the squat rack, does some warm-ups, then puts on 185lbs and fucking bangs them out. Few more sets, finishes up and just walks away like it was another day at the office. You could even see is friend try and talk him into using light weight. I was in awe and just watched these magical gains unfold.

I've been feeling shitty lately about my progress cause I've been stalling but fuck that, if this kid can do that with one leg, then I can get my ass out of bed and go to the gym as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm currently on week 5 of a cut. I've been still trying to figure out my diet and decide to try a IIFYM calculator to help me. It helped in terms of how many calories I need to consume (~2460 maintence and ~1900 for a cut) but in terms of nutrient it said to consume 240g of carbs, 150g of protein and 45g of fat. I understand the protein and fat, but the carbs amount just seems very high. Yesterday was my first day trying it, and even with eating complex carbs with every meal, I was only at 210g with about 200 calories left.

Should I decrease my carb intake and up my protein intake to help balance the diet more, or leave it at that?

I'm new to all of this so any help would be great! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Video: https://youtu.be/tldPKY0Ys8I

Each of these exercises I completed for 3 sets of 5 reps. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**Squat:**

Questions: 

* It looks as though I hit parallel everytime, but should I be going lower if I can?
* My elbows are jutting out, obviously and is that a bad thing? I did my last two sets with my elbows tucked in, but it felt uncomfortable and put a strain on my shoulders.

**Deadlift:**

To me it looks like my overall form was shit. I never was properly taught how to deadlift so have been watching youtube videos to learn. The one that really helped me was Alan Thrall's video, which is what I used as a basis. It looks as though I'm using my back too much and not enough of my legs. Also I kept rocking back when I got all the way up, how can I stop that? The weight was relatively easy, but should I use a lighter weight just until I can get proper form? </TEXT>

If you like ICF then do ICF. You are obviously still hurting so it is good to be doing a workout you enjoy so it makes the gym as fun as possible!

As far as nutrition I would look at the wiki and search bar as they can both answer questions you may have. Also look up youtube videos to help with tips and proper form on exercises.

Make sure to set your goals and stick by them. You got this dude! </TEXT>

Someone was curling in the squat rack! Can finally cross that off on the gym bucket list.

But real story time, so does anyone feel like they are that unliked or outcast regular? I've been going to my gym for about 2 years now and know pretty much the regulars. The thing is is that they all talk and interact with each other, except for me. Plus someone them give me dirty looks, especially this one trainer who just stares at me while I do my workout. I mean maybe it's just me, but I feel like I'm disconnected from the others cause I'm one of the only young people who use my gym. I don't mind it to much though cause I pretty much keep to myself but just something I thought I'd share. </TEXT>
