	<TEXT> I understand the sentiment, but that's exactly what they're banking on. 

So many dumpster fires you can't possibly focus on one, and this attitude absolutely proves that their strategy is working.

The casual acceptance of open corruption, nepotism, and incompetence is the lasting effect that Trump will have.

It's also the greatest threat to the future of this country as we know it because the effects will be present regardless which party is in control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course they are. No one is holding them accountable for telling lies, and it's successfully served as a distraction.

People just need to ignore it or start holding them accountable (and that's not going to happen, esp. by fellow Republicans). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah Fox news is still very much in the tank for Trump and trying to discredit all of the Russian connection stories. 

Watched Fox for a minute last night and they had some "Russian expert" guest on. Both he and Tucker kept talking about how there's no real consensus that the email hack was done by the Russians and that Clapper cleared Trump of any involvement (neither are true).

He also laughably tried to assert that his expertise in studying Putin only confirmed how none of the of stories being published are true...because he knows how Putin operates and none of this is in character (LOL).

For people who only get their news from Fox...I wouldn't be surprised if they think that Trump was actually vindicated this week...thats pretty much how Fox is trying to portray the last week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't forget about Guilianni...he's also a cyber security expert.

He'll run some Norton Antivirus on it and get to the bottom of the problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting...the_comrades have posted a Brietbart article that claims she's one of the main leakers in the WH and was forced out.

Won't give them a click so I didn't read anything but the headline and a few comments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every Republican now realizes that Trump desperately needs their support to obstruct justice.

Ryan is going to use Nunes to pressure Trump into doing exactly what he wants.

The healthcare bill was just the start of this...Republicans dont care about treason if it helps their agenda. </TEXT>
