	<TEXT> If I haven't drawn down the attention of established institutions upon myself by the time I'm 47, I'd say my shit is pretty well together.  And what is 'normal'?  What everyone else is that I'm not? Thank God.  We would first have to establish a baseline foundation upon which to define 'normal'.

I'll roll with having no criminal history, no medical history whatsoever (on paper).  No one in my environment has decided that it's time to arrest me or to intervene upon me; so I guess if they have a problem with my problem, it is actually a 'personal problem' they are experiencing.  That's just me being arrogant.  

And I'm not 'showing' myself to anyone who doesn't already see me.  Why on earth would anyone do that?  "Hey!! Statistician taking note of society's scourge!  You skipped me, I wouldn't want your findings to be wildly inaccurate."  The people that lend their face to being the scourge are not the 'normal' , but rather the extreme.  There are many, many more standing amongst the normal crowd watching the circus.

	<TEXT> (I'm not all too concerned w/ what society thinks of me, but what the hell) I was attracted to drugs because of a couple of reasons....major reason being my anxiety disorder, or whatever you want to call it, ruled my life in the sense of a constant nagging upset stomach.  To the point it was crippling (the stomach ailment, not the anxiety) The only reprieve I have ever known was through drug use. That, and I grew up in a functional drug environment, I thought all adults did drugs when I was really young.  The stigma of it all didn't become apparent to me until I was in my teen years.  And that was when I began using.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the very early '90's, immediately following my divorce (I was 21) I wore a Sinead O'Connor head for about a year and a half to two years.  I loved it.  I am intimidating anyway, whether I mean to be or not...and I was in a very bad mood.  I felt this mood was going to last for a while.  It took care of the "beautiful young lady' bullshit which I had never subscribed to.  The few men brave enough to approach me either thought it was mega-cool, or they had balls.  That worked for me.  Everyone wanted to rub my head.  (punk rock bar patrons)

My main regret is not having documented this in a photograph.  I have been looking for one for 25 years, to no avail. (looking amongst friends and circle I hung with) </TEXT>

To some degree, I agree with this, given chaos being present in each and every event would have a differing set of variables. Some predictable, some quite unpredictable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A friend of mine, tripping on acid, listening to his walkman (The Doors, LA Woman) went running full speed through a very old cemetery, the kind that normally don't take new interments....except once in a blue moon, so to speak.  His dumb ass fell into a fresh dug, never been used yet grave, upon where he was stuck for a LONG time.  Like until sunrise.  This was evening, 5-6pm.  

He was trippin'. </TEXT>
