	<TEXT> Animal Farm is so different than 1984 it's hard to do a better/worse comparison.  Animal Farm has a lot of the same kinds of messages but the humor he uses to communicate them, the allegory, while not subtle, made it a little easier for me to be emotionally removed from the story.  It's still pretty disturbing but it comes off as somewhat less menacing than 1984, at least to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're pretty varied - sci-fi, biography and a murder mystery so I don't have that problem with this set.  That has happened on occasion and then I have to go back and start one of them all over again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuzzy Nation by John Scalzi, Shooting Victoria by Paul Murphy and Real Murders by Charlaine Harris.  I have a hard time sticking with one start to finish so I tend to read a few at the same time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is one of my very favorite books.  I feel that books are like friends - you have a few that are always there waiting to help you if you're having a bad day and P P is one of those for me.  Glad you're enjoying it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This makes me think of American Gods by Neil Gaiman...

I'd also recommend A Game of Universe by Eric Nylund - it's out of print in hard copy but it's available on the Kindle at least.

If you don't mind books created for a younger crowd, Rick Riordan's The Kane Chronicles might fit the bill. </TEXT>
