	<TEXT> I had a friend, weird kid, who did this once. I was out to eat at a restaurant with him and a few other people and I had to take a shit, apparently so did he. We went into the bathroom together, me in one stall him in the other. In between the two stalls there was a tiny grate in case water overflowed. I noticed his legs werent facing the correct way, they were facing away from me. He shits right on top of the grate, then takes toilet paper and smushed it through there. I was honestly shocked. I yelled "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?! SOMEONE HAS TO CLEAN THAT UP?!?!" Proceeded to wipe, wash my hands, and storm out of the bathroom. I went to our table and left a 20 even though I got one drink, told the table, "James just fucking shit on the floor and mashed it into the grate." Told the server as well and left. No idea what happened and I never talked to the kid again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If by largest you mean area, then the British Empire at its height was the largest overseas empire in history, where as the Mongol Empire was the largest contiguous empire.

Though, I'd argue that the Roman Empire was the largest, as its second after the Mongols and is considered a perfect empire because unlike the Mongols, the Romans were able to control and sustain their land. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Islam Is Not EviSure, 9/11 was terrible. It was an awful thing to do. Those people are terrorists. But they were disobeying the law of the Quran. Which is to never murder the innocent. Osama Bin Laden is not perfect. In fact, I am ashamed to call him a Muslim, because he isn't. He's disobeying the law of the Holy book. Please stop terrorizing and stereotyping Muslims because of so many evil people who claim to be Muslim.

The Qur'an only says to kill in the state of a war. Those evil "Muslims" raping and bombing down buildings of those who aren't Muslims are ignorant and deserve to rot in hell. Islam teaches to respect and be kind to your neighbours. It teaches cleanliness and so many more common things that they teach in other religions such as Christianity and Judaism. 

Girls in Islam cover their hair so they don't get raped or so they don't cheat on their husbands. Is that evil or oppressed? Muslim girls should have the right to wear the hijab or not.

Also, the first thing anybody thinks of when I say terrorists are Muslims. When really the meaning has nothing to do with Islam. But I admit 9/11 and all those other attacks by dumb, careless Muslims have created this false stereotype. 

And this is all written by an 11 year old girl. Call me dumb and immature but this is the truth. I have never stereotyped Christians or Jews or been offensive to any other religion. I have chosen not to wear hijab because IT'S MY CHOICE. And any other caring parents should give their daughter that choice. I will wear it soon. And heck, my best friends are Christians and other religions and if they can accept Islam, so can the rest of you.l Islam is  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Twenty-five is a unique age. For many people at this stage of life, there's been a straightforward path up until this point. High school led to college; college led to a first job in the real world. And then all of a sudden, there's no obvious direction.

The options are overwhelming, and it's hard to know which path to choose. The thought that life could go so many different ways can be paralyzing.

I just turned 25, and I'm trying to figure out how to claim this age. I spoke with Leslie Bell, a psychotherapist in Berkeley, California, to learn more about the science behind this period of life. </TEXT>
