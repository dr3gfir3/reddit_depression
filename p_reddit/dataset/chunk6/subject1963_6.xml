	<TEXT> Agreed with this math, and also chiming in with my own pay - I work 30 per week, 10 hours each for 3 days. I make 15 an hour but most of the day, the two older kids are in school and I hang out with the toddler. 

I make 450/wk. I feel that's about right since I'm mainly only with one kid, but still on the lower end. I think you could reasonably ask for $450 (plus an additional hourly rate for anything over 35 hours or so) with the understanding that you can reassess in six months or so.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like your skin did what my skin did. I tried several different routines and products, hated how it looked, considered going on Accutane, and then... it cleared up. Now I barely wash my face, maybe once or twice a week, just moisturize most days. I used to have tons of those closed comedones and the cysts in the same places - jaw and chin. 

My skin sort of miraculously cleared up. I am also 25 (getting older) and my diet has changed a little so maybe that's helping. No clue. I did try Curology for a few months but now haven't used it in two months and it's still gone. Every time I see myself in the mirror I expect to see acne and redness and peeling and scars but my skin is nice. I still have no idea what happened. Maybe magic. I'm okay with that. Your skin looks so good! I'm so happy for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Srs as someone with natural freckles I don't understand the crazy amount of hate that fake freckles get. If someone wants to dot on some fake freckles because they like the look, what's the big deal? This whole "I like your makeup but I HATE FAKE FRECKLES AHGGAKXNE" thing feels a little like telling someone "I HATE push up bras/fake boobs, they're awful and they need to die because I DONT LIKE THEM but your dress looks nice I guess." What. 

Makeup is supposed to be FUN, including fake freckles and fake lashes and foundation and contour and shimmering highlights you can see from spaaaaace and purple mother fuckin' lipstick. FUN. FUUUUN. LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!!! /rant  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My completely natural freckles are in a similar position to these. Over the nose, apples of my cheeks, a few stragglers on my cheekbones. Not everyone with freckles has a full face of them. I've been accused of faking my freckles a few times when I wear sheer foundations or nothing on my face. 

Everyone gets poked fun of for their features. Some people get teased about freckles, or hair, or boobs! But people fake freckles and people dye their hair and people get fake boobs or reductions or whatever all the damn time. Why get mad?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to do this all the time. I didn't realize how bad it was until later, but I still stand by the idea that it wasn't a "bad" thing to do. Mostly, when I said things like that, it's just because I was trying to relate. I always always had older friends, 2-10 years older, so when someone would tell me about something cool they had done/gotten, I would return with something similar that happened because I wanted them to realize I was "on their level" or that I was mature enough/experienced enough to deserve to be there. It's a compensation thing. Self-worth. They're looking for praise. 

Confrontation doesn't help this situation much, and neither would sarcastic comments like another poster said - it'll really just hurt her feelings and further that need to belong. If it's overt, like someone got a big promotion and she has something to say, just deflect it a bit - say "cool", ask a question, and go back to talking about the other person. Or if you really want to talk to her about it, be supportive. Let her know that you all value her friendship so much but that when she does that, you feel like she's not being supportive of or happy for your other friends, and that it makes that person feel less than in their big moment or makes them feel like she doesn't care about them. Relating it to how she is probably feeling is going to be a more successful strategy than sarcasm.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My family is also kind of like this. Generous, fair, super fun. I have three kiddos with them, the two big kids are in elementary school during the day but the LO is 3, we have lunch with my fianc all the time because he works close by and when he comes to pick me up at night, she always runs out to say bye to him. The parents default to any decisions I've made during the day. We're truly a TEAM. And the $500 holiday bonus doesn't hurt. I read so many negative posts on this sub and I cringe. I feel bad.

	<TEXT> I had a lab/Shepherd/Rhodesian Ridgeback mix dog growing up. She was the dumbest, most playful dog I have ever met. She thought she was a lap dog. But ooh, man, did she protect our house. That mailman was not a fan. He couldn't even bribe her with treats, she'd crouch and wait until he got alllll the way up to the door, started putting the mail in, and THEN she'd jump up and scare him off. 

Also, seconding the self defense idea. I am also disabled and have taken an adaptive class just to help me in case I ever need to get myself out of a situation. I'm no pro boxer but if someone tried to grab me or attack me, they're going to land on their ass. Most self defense isn't about being stronger than your opponent, just knowing the right moves to disable them or get yourself free and get out of there. I have a spinal condition and degenerative muscle issues but I could take down a large grown man even if he attacked my weak side. None of what I learned was super specific to a certain discipline, either, so I'm sure any place near you that teaches SD can help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, technically nobody really "deserves" a bonus, the reward you get for putting in hard work is the paycheck you receive... that's the point of a job. 

But it is much appreciated when one IS received. Usually depends on the financial situation of the parents and whether or not they've given bonuses to prior nannies, if they have had any. Last year I was very surprised to get a bonus of several hundred dollars from my current NF, who I had only been with for a few months at the time. But they've had plenty of professional nannies in the past and they're financially pretty comfortable so this is just the norm for them. I had no expectations of receiving one. I admit I'm curious if I'll receive the same this year but I'm not counting on it in any way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Must be nice to have a gaggle of rich girlfriends. Or just... girlfriends. 

Money does not equal love and support. Love and support make someone your best friend. If a bridesmaid is butt hurt about not being called a bride's "best friend" because of money and time spent, what kind of friend is she? And for that matter, who is paying for this wedding? Does the person with the biggest check become the default Bride's Bestest Friend? Why compete? Why take away from what her wedding is about - which is her marriage to her husband and their love? "No! I'm more important than the groom because I willingly spent my precious time and money to be here for YOU!" Yuck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agreed. I have an ex that I just could not fix my problems for. Nothing against him - he's sort my one that got away. Incredible partner. But I was young and reckless and couldn't commit and kind of an idiot and a flake. 

I have an ex who couldn't commit to ME, years later, my last before my now fianc. That ex couldn't stop showing up late, not calling when he said he would, the whole deal. Made me realize what I'd done to the first guy. 

And now I'm getting married and I see both of those guys happy and it STILL hurts, 7 and 5 years later. What if I'd changed for Kevin? What if Matt had changed for me? What was different about these other partners? 

Ah, well, I fixed most of my issues a while ago, and now I am getting married to someone after I got smart and got older. Kevin's girlfriend is a lucky girl if she's still got him. Matt's girlfriend... actually, Matt turned into an asshole, so I don't know how she puts up with him, but he committed, so who knows what was different about her.  </TEXT>

It's not a ton of money, and if you'd like to take the least aggressive approach, mentioning it while still letting her know that you're letting it slide this time will do the job.

	<TEXT> Yeah fuck anyone who says anything about the dress you pick. Your body. Your wedding. I went and tried on dresses last Sunday with my mom, future MIL, future SIL, and my grandmother. Everyone wanted me to get this poofy A-line deal that had weird butt wings - I don't know how else to describe it - there was weird layering of lace in the back and the lace flipped up near my butt. I had butt wings. Newer Hayley Paige so I can't find a picture. Butt. Wings. The top was super flattering and pretty but the bottom looked like someone awkwardly stapled lace drapes on a dress but only around the butt wings. 

I'm a true hourglass but a size 12 top and bottom, measurements for a 6/8 in the middle. A-lines look good on me, typically! But I wanted something easier and more comfortable than that, not a lot of poof, so when I found a relatively straight cut dress (Catherine Deane - Genevieve, found at BHLDN, zero poof!) I fell in love. Everyone kept saying the Hayley Paige dress (which was more than twice as much, and again - BUTT WINGS) was the best and was totally my dress. Everyone kept muttering that the other dress was more flattering. But fuck that. I'm not really here so other people can decide my waist and shoulders look better in this or that. 

My dress is going to look bomb, your dress looks bomb, everyone else can just get. out.  </TEXT>

First time poster and on the dumb mobile app, so plz excuse the dumb link and not a real formatted one. I promise I'll figure out links in comments one day. 

25F, wearing this dress in Plum for Engagement photos tomorrow at Disneyland. I wanted to feel a little festive and cute without going either red or white. I have a pair of taupe strappy/cut out flat ankle boots I'm thinking of wearing with it because I don't have many pairs of cute shoes. I am a size 12 and fairly self-conscious about my shape so I don't typically dress up much except for special occasions. 

What would be best to accessorize? I've never had pictures taken like this. I am admittedly bad at anything fashion related. And does anyone have ideas for hair or makeup? I'm going to get my hair and makeup professionally done because while I'm good at doing my own makeup, I wouldn't want to risk it (or even attempt to tame my hair) with something so important. Definitely false lashes. I am not afraid to go dramatic with makeup but don't know if it would be too much to do a dark lip, which is sort of my standard. 

Thanks in advance! 

Edit: I bought sheer tights as one option but not sure about those either, especially with cutout boots. Would this look weird?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going camping for just a couple of days before a music festival in Chandler for NYE. I've done plenty of winter camping in Southern California but haven't camped at all in AZ. Anyone have any favorite spots? I have looked into a few sites but it's so hard to tell unless you've been there and many are closed for the winter. I'm partially disabled but can do short hikes (4 or 5 miles RT) and would maybe want to do one while we're there. Something with a great view would be awesome, and hopefully not too busy but we're willing to brave a few crowds for the right spot. Tent camping, we've got all our own gear but not enough to go full wilderness camping, etc. We're hoping to not go too far East, anything on the West side of the state is ideal. Thanks!

	<TEXT> If I had just read the post and not any of your follow-up comments, I'd say give it a shot. "Once a cheater always a cheater" is bullshit. I heavily cheated on two of my exes because I was 18/19 and they didn't make me happy but I didn't have the confidence to leave them. But I have never cheated on and will never cheat on my SO, who I am marrying in a year. Some people do change and mature. 

But your guy's lack of explanation and evasive statements would make me turn and run. He can't even be honest and remorseful, he's just trying to make his ex look crazy so you don't believe it. Don't waste your time.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Planning a wedding three hours from home. A last minute dream bridal salon opening while already on the way to a vendor meeting. Just feeling a bit of unplanned wedding planning serendipity going on. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There's a bridal salon (The Dress Theory, San Diego CA) that I've been fangirling over for as long as I can remember. I never thought I'd actually be able to make an appointment there - lots of family to cart around and plenty of shops near where I live in LA. So I said it was okay, maybe some time, but sort of gave up. I had ideations of going by myself because my family is fairly opinionated. I actually have two appointments on Sunday with six people each. I could not have said no to any of them. 

Today my fianc is taking a half day off work (my off day) to come to a florist meeting. Yeah, we have to drive like three hours every time we want to meet with a vendor, but it's fine. We have family in SD we like to see anyway. 

But I wake up this morning after he leaves and The Dress Theory pops into mind. I think, what the hell, they're busy people, but maaayybe they have an opening today. I just felt like it was supposed to happen. Today was the day. And I was previously someone who didn't want my fianc to see me in anything remotely bridal before the wedding day, but he's my best friend and I really trust his opinion when it comes to what looks good. So, you know, it could be fun if they had an opening. 

Well, they didn't. But that was okay. I was going to make an appointment for another day. It was fine, only mildly disappointing, but I often get excited over weird shit so it was no biggie. I got in the car, we started driving down, and then I get another email - they just had a cancellation! For this afternoon! After my florist meeting! I immediately start squealing in the car and I'm so stinkin' happy. We also just found the perfect caterer this past weekend, so it's all falling into place all at once! Ah! And we get to see one of my favorite members of my fiance's family today! 

I'll update ya after my swim in tulle, magic is real, bye!!!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Strong lip/eye looks without foundation. Thoughts? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-24 22:27:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi! So this is a thing I haven't played around with much before. I used to have acne that ranged from mild to moderate and TONS of hormonal redness and flaking. I hated my skin and would only buy super full coverage foundations. Because of this (and my love for smoky eyes) I think it just became a weird rule in my head - I couldn't wear eyeshadow unless I had full foundation on. Obviously most people scale coverage in foundation and intensity in eye looks fairly equally, but I could not figure out what was so weird about it for me for soooo long. 

Over the last four months or so I've been doing new stuff with my skin. My acne has COMPLETELY cleared up and I have almost no redness. I still have some healing spots (dark pinkish but small) and some permanent small scarring. (You can see a picture of this and my progress in my post history, I posted my bare face to SCA! Something I thought I would never do!) But I feel okay going out with makeup now, where I used to hate being bare-faced. 

Today I did a full smoky purple/cranberry eye. A little blush and bronzer. Highlight. Full brows. But no foundation. A touch of concealer under my eyes. That's it. I grabbed the foundation bottle and I am doing my makeup in the car so I didn't want to deal with the work of putting on foundation in the car. 

I love it! I get to let my skin breathe and it looks natural. I don't have to spend my whole holiday blotting and reapplying and touching up. But if you saw someone on the street with a full eye look and no foundation, would you think it looks weird? I don't see if often and wonder if there's some unspoken rule about following that scale - dark eye needs foundation.

I remember seeing a post here ages ago actually with a girl who did this with a dark lip (maybe it was blue? Maybe!) and I loved it. She's actually been sort of my inspiration for this whole love-my-skin, let-it-breathe movement. Ah! 

I'll still wear it for any time I want to look really nice and even out my scarring, but I may stick to this from now on. 

Thoughts?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad and stepmom tried to get me to get my dress MADE by their "seamstress friend" in downtown LA. They used two examples (my step moms wedding dress and my stepsisters quinceanera dress) both of which were laser pure white "reproductions" of designer dresses. Not only did these dresses look almost nothing like the originals, part of my step moms dress tore in the middle of their ceremony. But they were like "she's a pro! She'll give you a really good deal! She can exactly remake any dress you want for $500!" 

No thanks, Dad. Ends up that was the only way he was willing to contribute to my wedding. If I let him buy my wedding dress and if it was through this seamstress. Forget the fact that my family has a tradition - women have their dresses bought by their maternal grandmothers. It's gone on for a few generations now. It's what we do. Post-divorce my dad decided the only way he'd help with my wedding was if I broke this tradition. Nope. 

Between that and other problems, my dad is lucky he's being INVITED to my wedding. Why do parents insist on doing crazy shit like this?! Ugh.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Rant/advice needed: A florist screwed us over and double booked after asking for a deposit BEFORE sending a contract. I left a bad review, she's disputing it, but she's lying. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-22 19:19:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, this is annoying and I have had no bad wedding planning things happen up to this point (besides my dream caterer being 2x my budget and me having to turn them down) so this is really rubbing me the wrong way. I figure you guys might have some advice or wisdom on the situation. 

I am getting married next September in San Diego county, about two and a half hours south of where I live. Vendors are expensive in CA in general but San Diego in particular seems to be a financial drain. We have had a sort of tricky time finding people to meet our budget and our vision, but nothing too bad. We started looking into florists a little over a month ago. 

I immediately found one I liked. She had a rough pricing outline on her site that fit well within our conservative budget and allowed for some play room. Her work was beautiful. I sent her and three other florists messages for quotes, and she was the ONLY one still available. Apparently affordable florists book up fast 'round these parts. 

We started going over a customized quote. We talked to her over several weeks, once or twice on the phone. She totally got our vision and was initially a dream to work with. On a Tuesday, I asked her how a contract and deposit worked for her, and she replied Wednesday night letting me know that a deposit of $250 had to be made via a paypal link on her site BEFORE she'd send over a contract. Red flag. It was already late into Wednesday evening by the time I got the email, so I figured I'd email her Thursday morning. 

Thursday morning I receive a very curt email from her stating only "Just wanted to inform you that another couple has booked with me on your same date and I'm no longer available. Good luck!" 

This, less than 36 hours after I told her I wanted to book with her. I didn't even get a chance to express my concern over putting in a deposit before the contract was sent over. 

I replied expressing my frustration since we'd been working together for weeks and now she'd apparently booked someone else in less than 18 hours after she'd told me how to pay. 36 hours since I'd asked to book with her. I was now much farther behind on booking a florist in a high-demand region. I let her know that I thought her handling of the situation was unprofessional and that I'd be writing a negative review on a few sites to reflect that. 

THAT'S WHAT THESE THINGS ARE FOR. To express delight or concern with a vendor. 

That's when her attitude changed - she was sooooo sorry it happened, she didn't mean to upset me and it was never her intention to upset anyone. This other bride apparently just booked her via the paypal link on her site without ever talking to her. She claimed she'd never spoken to this bride before and that the lady had just sent her $250 so she had to book with them first over me. 

First of all, the paypal link thing? Doesn't seem right. If it's someone you've already been talking to and that's your preferred payment method, fine. But booking a florist without even talking to them? Plus it's not like paypal lists her available dates. This person would have sent over $250 without even knowing if she was free for their date. It doesn't seem right to me. But that's almost beside the point. 

I left a short review about how I felt the handling of the situation was unprofessional and how she really only tried to remedy the situation after I mentioned writing a negative review. She said negative reviews affected her livelihood and asked me to remove it or edit it. I told her I might remove it, because I'd been angry, but that I wasn't happy with how she handled it and that she should make changes to how she does her booking so she doesn't screw anyone else over like this. 

She swore she'd change the way she did it - she hasn't. Her website is unchanged, link still up. 

Still, I emailed The Knot about editing or removing my review because I had been upset when I left it. They seemed to bounce me around for a few days between departments but this morning it finally came out - she's disputing the review and claiming that I lied about her asking for the deposit before the contract. They highlighted the section in my review where I mentioned that that was a red flag for me, and stated that she'd told them it was just a miscommunication and that she'd provided some sort of evidence that she hadn't said that. 

Well, I took a screen shot of the email where she'd asked me to do exactly that. The wording isn't vague. She says "The contract will be sent to you after placing your reservation fee of $250." AFTER. She stated explicitly that she'd send the contract AFTER we paid the fee. She even attached a sample contract stating that it would look "similar" to ours, and that she'd write the contract after receiving payment.  

So I emailed The Knot back with that screen shot attached to let them know that I'd like the review to remain up now, it all it's glory. She only half-assed tried to remedy the situation after I told her about reviews, and then she tried to have it removed anyway even though it was all 100% true. 

Am I right to want to leave it up? This has all been a huge headache. If deleting the review would make this go away it would almost be worth it, but I don't want someone else to get disappointed the way I did and her handling of the situation, boiling down to accusing me of lying, is absurd. 

I feel like The Knot is handling this the best they can. But they did ask me to edit or remove that section. I replied with the screen shot so I'm hoping they see I'm not lying. I'm not taking that part down. That's the part that was the big red flag to begin with. And to be honest, she's lucky I only left the review on The Knot and didn't go to every freaking website I know to leave one. This is just tacky. She handled it unprofessionally and now she's saying I'm lying. 

She also won't stop emailing me! I told her to leave me alone, that I'd find a new florist on my own and didn't want her help. She has emailed me every day, sometimes multiple times a day, for the last week. I haven't responded to her at all after telling her I would do things on my own. I feel like I can't get away from this woman. After SHE messed up. 

I let The Knot know she was lying, but if they come to me with any more doubts I'm showing them every pestering email she's sent me since this happened. 

AHHHHHHHHH.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I scraped as much out of the bottle - with the tube on the end of the pump - as I possibly could. I thought about getting one of those little spatula things but I would really only use it for this. 

Regular usage since June of this year. Probably not every day, maybe 5/7 days a week for the first half then every day for the last half. 

This is my holy grail moisturizer. My skin can be pretty sensitive/VERY prone to breakouts and gets oily midday around my t-zone and my cheeks. This has improved the texture of my skin so much, even before I changed anything else about my routine. And it feels so refreshing! Not heavy or slick at all. 

I tried to buy the lotion instead. Sephora was out of the gel in the size I liked, so I tried the lotion. Nope. Nooooope. Back to the mall immediately. Exchanged for the gel two days later.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MAC has their new Spellbinder shadows - the shade Retrograde is a gorgeous sapphire blue that applies well with a brush and would be a great mid-lid color on like a gray/sapphire/black smoky eye. 

Another pretty blue is the MUFE artist shadow in Sapphire - same deal. A nice lid color that could be augmented with gray and black. 

Alternately, you could do a basic gray/cool smoky eye with a metallic blue inner corner highlight. I like to take my inner corner shadows a little farther on the lids when I do this to really make it stand out. Then it's not a heavy heavy blue but it's a very noticeable pop.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, this is my first time really planning anything of this magnitude and I'm not super sure about any of this. But it was my impression that you always signed a contract before sending a deposit. Is this true? Are there cases where you'd deposit before signing a contract? I know my photographer did it at the same time, as did my venue. But my florist is requesting $250 be sent over before she writes up the contract. This strikes me as off. I don't know if she's new (she seems to be a small scale florist, I've seen examples of her work but she's very affordable and she is on the major wedding sites) or if this is just a thing with smaller vendors? 

Has anyone done this before? My brain is just uncomfortable with sending this woman money over PayPal without any kind of contract written up, but it's a good deal and she's willing to come to our venue up a mountain. Agh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "These four years have been mostly good." I'm gonna stop you there and tell you a story. 

When I was like 17 I had this boyfriend who really liked going down on me. He was pretty freaking good at it so I never minded. I was on weird birth control that made me really irregular. I think you n is where this is going. 

One day he went down south and came up with a confused look and a mouth full of blood. I was so embarrassed, apologized profusely, reiterated that my BC made me start randomly (I used to, no joke, start on Tuesdays first thing when I woke up. Exactly every four weeks, when I woke up.) and that I was so so sorry and he didn't have to do that until I was off my BC in case it happened again. 

He just shrugged, cleaned his face off, got me stuff to clean up, and said it wasn't my fault. 

If a fucking 17 year old guy can get over period blood face, your grown ass adult boyfriend should be able to handle a little surprise blood. And for that matter, any man who pressures a woman about her body is just gross. 

Don't waste your time with a dude that's freaking out about your tummy and your period. Don't waste your time on a relationship that you only described as "mostly good." If he's not actually amazing and this isn't just a weird out of character reaction, he's super immature. What is this guy going to react like if you ever have children? Or if you ever have to just be around children? Or if, god forbid, you have another surprise period? Agh.

	<TEXT> The best thing that has helped my marks has actually just been a heavy, heavy amount of hydration. I've found that using an exfoliant or any kind of thing that's supposed to fade marks just irritates my skin. I stopped trying for a while. The thing that finally started helping fade my marks was kind of odd. My skin was dehydrated and took forever to heal. On my times where I take a few days break from Curology (I only use it probably twice or three times a week right now) I like using Sephora brand sleep masks. There's an "Ultra Moisturizing and Brightening" one that I'm obsessed with. Forgot to mention it in my routine. It's like $4 for a tiny little thing, but I can get three uses out of it if I can seal the rest of it in something airtight. I used to use the corner of a ziplock and squeeze the air out, but eventually bought a few tiny screw top plastic containers. Worth it.

I know it sounds like a weird thing to heal scarring and redness but I will swear by it. I slather that crap on my face like it's going out of style, sleep on it, and presto. Whatever "brightening" magic is in there has helped with marks. It's a very very gentle sort of way to work on marks without drying out or irritating skin. Just what worked for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that calling it anything different has any effect on what I'm doing. I've been consistently making healthier choices for a while now. I don't think that using a four letter word is going to make me go all self-destructive. A diet is a diet - the basic meaning of the word diet is simpler than what most people use it as. Dietitians create diet plans. You adopt a healthier or less healthy diet depending on environmental and emotional factors. Calling something a diet does not necessarily mean that it is an unhealthy crash diet or that it is a temporary change. A change in diet is a fundamental change in the nutrition that you are putting into your body. Some people adopt a vegan diet. Some people go Keto or Atkins or any number of diets. Yes, some people go on crash diets and follow weird rules and then gain it all back. That's exactly what I said I had done before, and wasn't doing this time. 

It's sort of rude to imply on someone's celebratory post that they're going to fail because they used the D word that you don't like. I do realize that this sub has a bit of a stigma surrounding the word diet, but is it impossible to be happy for someone without criticizing? Nowhere in my post did I say I was going to go back to my old diet after losing my weight. Why imply that? 

I don't mean to sound like a jerk, I'm just curious and yes, a little offended. It's not a "lifestyle change" for everyone. Personally, I love seeing when people make total overhauls and improve their lives, but calling what I'm doing a lifestyle change is laughable. Nothing else about my lifestyle changed. I'm still lazy and I don't drink quite enough water and I don't see anything or do anything THAT much differently. I just cut portions and got smart about numbers. I can use whichever term works for ME. Why imply that someone is going to fail because their terminology isn't what you would choose to use? 

Again, I don't mean to sound like a jerk. Just curious. Might be a good topic for discussion at one point - the de-stigmatization of the D word. I feel like the worlds of health foods and diet culture and fitness and popular diets have changed dramatically since even the mid-to-late-2000's, when everyone and their mother was on a fad "diet" and wondering why it wasn't working for them. I've always been fascinated with the cultural ideas behind diet and nutrition and how the internet (and with it, the influx of fitness and health bloggers) has changed that, with more easily available access to the simple truth - eat less, weight less.  </TEXT>

Uh? I thought I was in a derm's office, not my gyno. And even my gyno never tried to pull that crap on me. Also, trying more than one pill a month? Did this guy not understand BC?

	<TEXT> Hey! I just updated my routine in my comment I just made, but my current formula for Curology looks like this: 8% Azelaic Acid, 1% Clindamycin, .25% Zinc Pyrithione. My last formulation had something else I can't remember as the third ingredient and only 4% Azelaic Acid, and I feel like that's the standard formulation that most new users get. It worked really well for me but my second one works even better. Waiting to hear back on my third formulation now. The process is really easy with adjusting it, even if you're not out of your stock yet, so don't be afraid to shoot them a message often and let them know any concerns or victories!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, SCA! 

So, I wanted to thank those of you who have posted about Curology on here before - somehow, I trust this sub more than a google search (go figure!) and since I didn't have insurance at the time, I worked out that Curology was more cost-efficient at the time than paying out of pocket to see a derm. 

I'm 25, had normal/slightly sensitive skin all through my high school years. I really didn't develop much acne until I turned 21 or so, and then it just snowballed. A few pimples now and then turned into red, angry clusters of bumps on my cheeks and chin, pimples that would pop easily and scar for months. I started developing cystic acne, just one or two at a time but bad enough that it hurt to talk if they were near my lower half of my face or hurt to use facial expressions if they were up top. I used to wear makeup almost every day, so I cut that out, but even after that, I continued to get worse. 

When I started Curology four months ago, my face looked like the picture on the left. I fully admit the before and after isn't the best because the first picture is flipped (technology is hard) and the pictures are in different lighting - the first taken at night with overhead lighting, the second in daylight. But either way - I mean, zoom in. There's a very clear difference. 

I am someone who is hypercritical of my appearance and my skin. It is a terrible habit and one I'm trying to break as I'm trying to actually care for my skin instead of just "fix" it. If it's healthy, it will do the right things. 

Curology is just one part of my updated routine. I dropped harsh face washes and pore strips. I never used to use toner or moisturize. I hardly washed my face every day and would layer on Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid in hopes that one of them would make my face stop breaking out. It just made it worse, honestly, and I know that now. 

Here's what my old routine looks like compared to my new routine, thanks to SCA and a little side research:

1. Face wash. Went from scrubby Clean and Clear type stuff to CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. Honestly, I don't think I was sold for the first week or so. But at the end of that first week, my skin started calming down a bit so I kept it up. 

2. Toner. Went from No Toner to Thayer's Toner with Rose Petal. I think using something that smells nice (I love rose scents!) and was gentle on my skin kept me going because I felt like it was time to pamper my poor face. 

3. Treatment. Went from layers of BP or SA to Curology. I had noticed some change in my skin already when I switched cleansers, but WOW. Curology made a dramatic difference in my skin so so fast. The person who I was assigned to deal with is a little curt and sometimes seems robotic but both new formulations have been spot on. I have been to real in-office dorms before and been given a tube of Adapalene. When that didn't work, I had two derms scratch their heads and tell me to go on birth control despite telling them I have hormonal issues that keep me from using it. My Curology person tried one basic formulation, then when I addressed concerns a few weeks later, she reformulated it with a few tweaks and again, a dramatic difference. I'm betting my next one will be even better. I have total faith in this company so far and have heard amazing things about their customer service. 

4. Moisturizer. Went from... whatever was cheap and on hand, to Clinique. I have had good luck with Clinique being nice to my face in the past (the Superbalanced foundation or whatever it is used to be my HG for not killing my skin) so I was using the gel during summer, but just ran out and switched to the lotion for the drier months. Not 100% sold on it yet as it's a very different texture but my skin probably needs it. 

Also: I drink TONS of water now. And my skin feels so much different. I also just feel better in general. Go figure. This should have been an easy one but I'm either really stupid or really lazy, because it took getting to 25 to start drinking enough water. I also started changing my pillowcases more often and using dedicated face towels for drying and for rinsing off. 

I don't use Curology every day - maybe a few times a week. I don't even wash my face every day either, which I know sounds counterintuitive but has been working well for me. I don't think I realized before how sensitive my skin was. I sometimes just wipe it down with a warm wet washcloth in the morning and slap on moisturizer.

I have gone from someone who hated walking in public without makeup to someone who is comfortable going totally bare-faced or just putting on mascara. I still have a ways to go but the difference in my face is awesome. Honestly I'd almost forgotten how bumpy my cheeks were until I decided to check out Curology's B A feature. 

Thanks for the Curology referrals, product recs, and awesome community. You guys are the best.

	<TEXT> Alright, so my fianc recently started playing Assassin's Creed: Black Flag over for like the ninth time since we recently moved and he rediscovered console gaming. He's predominately a PC gamer and spends a lot of time at his computer. Problem is, his current chair is a $20 target POS and needs a replacement. 

Two questions: 

1) can any of you get me a picture of the front of this chair? I snagged one of the back while he wasn't looking, but can't figure out the front. Can't find it online. I think you see the front just when you first walk up to it in the beginning, but I'm not 100% sure. 

2. What's a mid-range desk chair that might already have red accents that I can fix up a little? Not looking for anything over $150-200, since I'll have to put other work into customization. I know pretty much nothing about chairs but I figure you guys probably have an idea. 

The most important thing is the picture of the front. Chair stuff I can probably figure out but I don't know how else to get a picture of the front. I want to surprise him. I've been joking about getting him a new chair since his old one died out like two years ago. 

Help!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I painted 10YO B's fingernails a few weeks ago. We usually play "nail salon" with his sisters - 3 and 7 - and he usually just watches or aims a hairdryer at their nails. This time he wanted to take part, with glitter. And why not? 

Then two weeks later, DB had the kids alone for a weekend while MB was out. DB is an engineer and a funny guy and let his girls put his hair in hair ties and take pictures. He drew the line at lip gloss. 

I love seeing parents that are more open. My dad was always very liberal in that aspect - he was a pink fairy for Halloween one year, I'll spare you the gory details - and is a lover of Hello Kitty and pink. 

I hope my future kids don't get sucked in by that blue/pink divide.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesus, this hit home. My FH and I have been engaged almost a year, getting married next September. We're a little behind on planning and I'm so stressed out by little details. I feel like I've mostly let go of the "Pinterest Perfect" wedding thing but sometimes I still feel myself getting that creeping feeling of total insecurity. Will it be pretty enough? Am I going to regret picking these colors or spending this much on these tables? 

Thanks for putting things back into perspective. It's not about the wedding. Ah!

	<TITLE> My uncle died. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-03 19:16:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My drug-addicted, homeless, thieving uncle died on October 29th. 

And here's the thing nobody wants to talk about: it's disgusting. 

I am old enough to remember who he was before the hard drugs. I am old enough to remember my Uncle Mike, a funny if a little troubled guy that was six years older than my mom, four years older than my other uncle. I remember being very young, he came to my grandparent's house for holidays and barbecues in those days, I'm pretty sure he actually had somewhere to live then. 

Then he stopped showing up. Mom told me a few months in that he was in jail. I don't remember what the first time was for, but it was the first of many. Theft, possession, loitering, resisting arrest. He wasn't a good man anymore. And the terrible thing is that it's not like the decks were stacked against him - he had a family that loved him very much and desperately wanted him to come home, to get better. He seemed like he wanted to, too, at least for a little while. 

My grandpa had this old fishing boat that my uncle stayed on for a while. He had this cat that he brought with him, simply named "Kitty", who was essentially feral but adored my uncle Mike. He stayed on that boat for months, and he was only allowed inside when my grandparents were home. For good reason. I think I only said hi to him once or twice. He was all but a stranger to me at that point, he'd been gone for years and my memories of him were mottled by stories of his latest arrests. 

And then he stole from them. He broke into my grandparent's house - my grandparents, who are a little secluded by choice and who just want the best for everyone around them, who let me live with them briefly when my mom was off her bipolar meds and kicking me out every other week, who would sneak a crisp twenty dollar bill into your hand because they just knew you needed it. He broke into their house and stole my grandma's jewelry - stuff that probably didn't net him much, it was all sentimental stuff, her wedding set from the 50's, some family jewelry. That kind of stuff. No diamonds or flashy jewels. Just enough gold for him to pawn off to get some drug money. And he was gone again. 

I saw him once or twice after that - one crossing the road in front of my mom and I's car, just weeks after he'd robbed my grandparents, in their neighborhood. We didn't know if he was casing the place or what. My grandma said they hadn't talked to him. She didn't want to press charges. My grandpa did - my previously gentle grandpa, who spent a lot of time in his room watching old westerns, who himself dealt with depression and the fight to get back to normal, to enjoying life, he wanted to go after Mike with the full extent of the law. Grandma stopped him. I wish she hadn't. Maybe if they'd locked him up again things would have changed. Probably not, though. 

The last time, several years ago. I was in my mom's car, again, passenger seat, texting someone before I went into my grandparent's house. We were parked right in front and he walked right out from behind the house and waved. I just looked back down at my phone. It was too soon after he'd stolen from them, I was old enough to understand that he wasn't going to change. 

Then I get a call last night, while I'm dealing with my own feelings about a police-involved shooting in my old neighborhood, while I'm trying to run a handful of events for a program I volunteer for, while I'm stressed about my job and trying to diet and planning my wedding. 

He overdosed, right on the beach. He always loved the beach. Couldn't stand to be away from it. No wonder he'd basically lived there for the last decade and a half. Lived and died there, right on the sand. 

And my grandparents, who tried to give their eldest son everything they could, one of whom tried to help him even when he'd stolen from them and betrayed their trust in the deepest of ways... my grandparents get to collect his body and his measly possessions. A final thud. It's not a surprise. 

I cried for three minutes. And then I told my fiance I wanted ice cream. So we went to the store, and we got ice cream, and we watched a movie. And we went to bed, and he left for work this morning. I have today off anyway. I feel like I should be miserable, like I should be crying or upset in any way. I'm not. I don't want to talk about it with family. I can't. I'm afraid it'll all come spilling out. I'm still mad at a dead guy. At least I don't have to be ashamed of him anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A woman was shot by police in my old neighborhood. So many people are outraged, but I am siding with police. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-02 22:12:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yesterday a woman was shot by multiple officers at once in my old neighborhood. Hearing "police shooting" immediately riles people up lately, and for good reason - police brutality is a real problem in this country. She was struggling with Bipolar Disorder, something a handful of people in my own family have suffered through. But I don't blame police for what happened at all in this case and I can't talk to anyone about it. 

But this was different. The woman was driving erratically, they were attempting to pull her over and bring her into custody. She had already been in an accident earlier in this incident - there was significant damage to her car, airbags were deployed, she was weaving in and out of traffic on the wrong side of the road. 

Police maneuvered themselves in a way that they partially boxed in her car. They told her to get out.
Instead, she floored it and rammed into a cruiser with people near it. Officers were injured. Understandably, they opened fire. She died from her injuries at the hospital. 

She may have been having a major psychiatric episode, but so many people are saying this could have been handled "better". How? They attempted to pull her over peacefully even after she'd done a hit and run somewhere else. She instead tried to harm more people with her car. She had no regard for her own life or for those surrounding her. What were they supposed to do, keep saying "pretty please" until she stopped having an episode? And at what cost? They had to shoot her to keep her from injuring even more people. Bipolar or not, a threat to other human lives is a threat. Does she get a pass from endangering others because of her diagnosis? No. 

I'm not someone who stands on the "police know best" side of the line but this incident, in my home town, is rubbing me the wrong way. They hear "police shooting" and it's an explosion. What would you have done differently? What else could they have done? I can't even say anything. People are spitting vitriolic anti-cop crap on every post. But really. What was their other option? Let her continue hurting and possibly killing other people?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> And it's still a disappointment. But hey, that's because I know my programming. I typically stay at a midnight kickoff until well after 5AM, then write for a few more hours the next day. I like to end Day One with 12k+, or whenever the little countdown on the word count calendar says "At this rate you will finish on November 5th". 

I know I do a ton the first day, then spend several days not wanting to write and also catching up with emails, errands, and NaNo messages (I'm an ML, though this year I've gotten a surprisingly low number of messages, which I'm okay with). 

I do this on and off until I put things off so badly that I have to write something like 15k in the last few days. I'm going to try not to do that this year, but I have no self control and I just got a new electric kettle, so I keep getting up to make tea or have a snack or check on one thing or another. 

Ideally I'd like to finish by the 15th - there's a name for it but I can't remember what it is. But that's what I want to try to do. I have a different work schedule this year where I work three ten-hour shifts a week, so with uninterrupted weekday time I might be able to get things done!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh awesome! We basically only checked out two venues before we checked out Bailey's, and both were just kind of... lacking the really natural feel, you know? We really like all the cabins on the property and we know we've got some extended family that will probably be staying in one of the two big VRBO rentals on the mountain, so if you've got any tips about those, let me know. How was the weather for your weekend? I'm totally paranoid that it's going to be too warm (anything over like 75 degrees I start whining about how I'm actually legitimately going to melt, I do not like hot weather) but the resort owners insist it's not bad in September. 

Would you mind PMing me your budget breakdown? We have different group sizes but I'm interested to see how it all breaks down for group meals so I can start doing the math.  

Congrats! Your pictures look beautiful!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It will be extremely difficult. You already know this. But think of how much harder it would be if you stayed miserable in this marriage. It's toxic. This is better for them. It allows you and your soon-to-be-ex to shape whatever life for your children that you want. You and your wife could get along fine in a few years. You could both be very happy without each other. It's much better for children to have HAPPY parents than parents that stick together out of some duty to "staying together for the kids." 

Side note: don't say a single negative thing about their mom until they're much older. Seriously. It seems like easy common sense stuff but it is actually really really hard. My parents split and then couldn't stop talking shit about each other for years. They still do. They're both much happier and healthier without each other. It's just petty and it doesn't endear your children to you when they start to understand the gravity of the situation. 

This is a healthy choice. It still sucks and feels awful but you'll look back and know you made the right move here. Just protect yourself and your kids and make sure they're supported and loved. But don't forget to take care of yourself, too. Eat. Sleep. Make sure you take some time to recharge and just breathe and keep yourself healthy. I wish you the best of luck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously you've already realized that you need to not leave the house for a while and that you need to lawyer up. I'd supplement with this: 

1. Make note of when the guy was at your house, that whole situation. You specifically asked her not to bring other men into your home and she tried to sneak behind your back and do it anyway. She brought someone you don't know into your home when you weren't home, endangering herself and possibly you/your family/your home in the process. 

2. Prepare for her to fight you on every little thing, because it sounds like she will. But as far as communications go, let her know that you'll continue to communicate day-to-day needs with her, but that anything surrounding the legal proceedings of your divorce will have to go through your lawyer. 

3. Keep your kids #1 in this - take a little extra time every day to remind them how much you love them and are there for them. A messy divorce is devastating to younger kids and they need to know they're your priority.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wedding Weekend Brides (or just helpful people): What are your biggest tips/tricks/what do you wish you'd done differently? I'm planning my four day wedding weekend and panicking! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-27 01:24:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi! Title says most of it, but basically I am 10.5 months away from my wedding weekend and having a hard time finding balance. My FH and I always knew we wanted something that was more than just a single day rental, but now that it's actually booked, we're having a hard time figuring out how this whole thing will work. 

We have a decent budget ($30k). Our venue cost $6k for all four days plus lodging for 20 for all of that, plus help with day of coordination stuff from the owner's wife. Our photographer is $4.5k, which I know sounds steep BUT that includes the engagement session, and he's coming up for the whole weekend to get 4+ hours of rehearsal dinner coverage, 10+ hours day of the wedding, a few hours for a farewell brunch the next morning, and a really nice leather-bound album that he does an amazing job on. Altogether it's something like 20 hours total just of photography and COUNTLESS  hours of editing. And he shot my uncle's wedding so I know he does amazing work. Those were two of our most important things. The other is food. 

How the heck does this work? Our list is 90% family - parents and sibs, aunts/uncles/cousins. That's it. And maybe a dozen friends, most of which all know each other. We're getting married at a mountaintop "resort" - think rustic cabins, dirt roads, the property has been around since the late 19th century. It's a beautiful natural area with tons of cabins on property and a big main house with two kitchens. Each of the cabins have their own kitchen, at the very least a stove, oven, microwave, fridge, and some counter space. 

FH and I are thinking of doing it this way: 

Thursday: everyone drives up early afternoon. Lunch on the way up. We pick up a few half kegs from our favorite brewery on the way up. 
Dinner: potluck. Everyone brings an app/side/dessert to share and my stepdad barbecues. This is mostly just immediate family. 

Friday: remaining weekend guests arrive. Rehearsal dinner. 
Breakfast: we provide coffee, juice, and pastries. Anything extra people have to bring up for themselves. 
Lunch: everyone brings their own. Lots of people will arrive around lunch or later so it isn't really possible to plan this when I can't know when everyone will be arriving.
Dinner: we provide a catered dinner, BBQ or something easy. 

Saturday: wedding! 
Breakfast: we provide coffee, juice, and pastries. 
Lunch: everyone has their own. We're planning on making it a picnic-type thing on the big front lawn of the main house. 
Dinner: we cater reception dinner and desserts 

Sunday: goodbye! Checkout is noon. 
Brunch: we provide coffee, juice, pastries. Family provides eggs/bacon/pancake type stuff for the group. 

That's it! So really, immediate family is covering their lunches and potluck on Thursday. Family coming up Friday is just covering Saturday lunch. Does this seem reasonable? I feel like it is and people are telling me it is, but I feel bad inviting people for a full weekend and making them drag food up a mountain - though I guess this wedding IS very family reunion-esque, and people pay for their own food on vacations. I just want to at least offer to do a little easy breakfast kind of thing to get people out and together in the mornings. 

And what about things to do? I know the property is big and really pretty. I'm hoping we can rent a projector and a big screen and watch a movie on the lawn the night of the rehearsal dinner. I don't know. What's too much? I don't want everyone feeling bored but I don't want anything feeling rushed, either. 

What have I gotten myself into??  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! As a fellow fair-skinned person with "separation anxiety, what finally worked for me was the method I set my makeup. I used to use a big fluffy brush to swipe powder on, then used a setting spray, and ended up with foundation separating within an hour. Ugh. I switched to this: Ester Lauder double wear foundation, let it sit a few minutes. Use RCMA no color powder and use a puff to press the powder into the skin. Add my blush/bronzer on top of that to keep things smooth, more patting motions instead of brushing. I use a brush but I do short lil patting presses instead of big long swipes, which disturbed my makeup. Then once it's all finished, MAC Fix +, then either UD all nighter or Skindinavia Bridal finish spray. 

My foundation never ever separates now. Also, I stopped exfoliating as much and went with a gentler skincare routine, which changed how oily I got. Better base makes for better makeup. I just use cera ve foaming cleanser, not even every day! And just water splashing other days. Thayer's rose petal toner then Clinique moisturizing gel. I had okay skin, acne prone and kind of bumpy, so I was SURE a simple routine wouldn't work for me. Instead, my skin has totally cleared up and my oil production is way way down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My fianc did the same thing - I technically wrote "I love you" in a Valentine's Day surprise card which I gave him and then sent him away while I lit some candles in his room. He came back a few minutes later and he sat next to me and he told me the story of this one time a month or two into our relationship - I was working at Disneyland and he was picking me up after my shift. I was late coming out by like 20 minutes because I went to go get him beignets to surprise him. He told me he got really worried that something had happened to me because I was so late getting out, and then I showed up with food and coffee. He was like "that's when I... well, I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you too."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seconding Stridex - a chemical exfoliant is going to be better for your bumps than a physical scrubby exfoliant because scrubs like that can further irritate the skin. I stopped using scratchy scrubs and my KP disappeared completely! Also, what kind of body lotion/moisturizer are you using? Use fragrance-free potions and stuff for the least irritating option. I use Lubriderm Advanced Healing and it's magical.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been using this on a client: Salmon tone corrector, Tarte Maracuja Creaseless concealer, set with RCMA no color powder, top with a light layer of powder foundation in her skin tone for a little extra coverage. That's the closest I've gotten. I like the it cosmetics concealer in general but I feel like while it covers a wide undereye area well, I can never get it to cover those fine-point, super dark areas.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the best luck with Mac prep and prime under the EL foundation. I've also been setting my face differently (pressing with RCMA no color powder now, used to brush on Laura mercier) which made a HUGE difference in the appearance and longevity of my makeup. Recently I've been mixing in a little of either Maybelline Master Prime illuminating primer or the Cover FX enhancing drops - I use celestial - and I feel all glowy and not cakey at all. 

Also, I sort of switched up my technique with my blush/bronzer, I do more of a dabbing motion with my brush with short blending strokes instead of long sweeping strokes. I noticed my bronzer went on patchy when I used longer strokes because it stuck to all my bumps and textured areas.
