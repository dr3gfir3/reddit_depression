	<TEXT> Hi guys, by definition irrational numbers are real numbers which cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers. I wanted to know is there a theorem which states that not all irrational numbers can be expressed as a rational power of rational numbers. Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys, I just saw the movie Dredd and was wondering which other actresses in Hollywood can pull off an evil villain like our queen Cersie can. I am in awe of this lady. When I think of lady villains Kathy Bates (Misery) comes to mind, maybe Meryl Streep (Devil Wears) Michelle Pfeiffer (Stardust). What other actresses do you think have the charisma and the ability to be a central evil figure in a movie ? </TEXT>

100 units of G  = 997 -32 = 965 units of F

1 unit of G = 9.65 times unit scale of F

so, (G-0)*9.65 = F-32

so, G = (F-32)/9.65 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way you are trying is much better for understanding, this might be a bit algorithmic :

1) It is good enough to prove prove LHS-RHS0, so lets say we have a function y= x^2 - 2x + 2

2) The minima of this function is at x  =1

3) y(1) =1, hence y = 1 for all x, in our case y = 0 will suffice

4) coshx  x^2 /2 + 1 from expansion series hence coshX  x </TEXT>

I would also like to add that the heat also had a very important part in the riot, i.e. racial tension is not a result of plain hatred but poverty, illiteracy for which the current generation is not entirely responsible. The movie is a critique on mob mentality, I can't remember any other movie which shows mob in action like this one. I worked in a factory where trade unions were very powerful and during strikes this is  very close to the way mob behaved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bit of a cliche but to me this is hope, beauty, magic and simplicity:

Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.
"After all this time?"
"Always," said Snape.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only thing that drives Tywin is 'family name', Tywin was always into prostitution (there is a hint in the book that he actually had a tunnel made from the red keep to Chataya's when he was the hand of the king), he just did it in a way that no one knew. So the lesson for Tyrion was hide your secrets to death, Tywin literally proved it. Ofcourse he is a evil hypocritical sob, but he is also everything that a survivor of that cut-throat medieval world should be. Also, he was mad at Tyrion for all the reasons that Tyrion claims in season 4, keeping him from away from girls was just another way to inflict pain on him, it had nothing to do with morality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just saw this movie, recommend to anyone who wants to see a gritty/dark western. It is a story of Irish outlaws set in the beautiful Australian desert but also subtly handles the themes of colonialism and justice. Tight screenplay and beautiful soundtrack. Just trying to bring into light one of those quiet and unassuming movies. Comments/opinions/questions are welcome ! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 8mm, a perfect movie in its genre. The movie starts on a sunny beach in Miami but the background score is so melancholy that I knew this is going to be sth special and it really was. Yeah and if your cast includes Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare, Chris Bauer what could possibly go wrong with the god already on your side ! </TEXT>
