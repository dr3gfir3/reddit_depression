	<TEXT> Fun brings people in from out side temporarily, and brings young people here for college or even shorter periods of time, then they leave, this is not how a city is built unless of course you're Vegas ;). We are not...


A study from the Manhattan Institute says otherwise.

See this article: http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2015/08/manhattan_institute_study_laud.html


"Brain Gain in America's Shrinking Cities," a new report by Aaron Renn, released today by the institute, lists Cleveland as one of 28 metro areas that experienced a double-digit percentage increase in residents with a bachelor's degree or higher between 2000 and 2013.


One reason for the solid performance by the Cleveland metro area is an increase in young, highly educated workers. Renn found that between 2000 and 2013, Cleveland-Elyria gained 7,650 adults between the ages of 25 and 34 with college degrees or higher, an 8.9 percent increase.


Cleveland is not only keeping young people with college degrees; it is gaining them. </TEXT>
