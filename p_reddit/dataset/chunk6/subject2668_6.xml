	<TEXT> I've rewatched it and even after all this time I think about  it daily. Yes this is the greatest match of all time, both of those guys told there body's fuck you I'm going to do this. I worry for okada because his neck might not be a problem now but a couple years down the line it's going to become an issue, I just hope it looked a lot worse than it really is.  But this match was truly the closest we have ever seen to a perfect match. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that is has been one of the biggest changes in the games outcome, there's so many players that this would have screwed over in years past. Tom westman comes to mind, if they change tribes this much in Palau then tom westman does not win, even though he had a strong relationship with Stephanie I think he would have been a huge target in a tribe swap.  </TEXT>
