	<TEXT> 99% sure. It's the cause of 99% of the crashes since launch. In the new patch notes wrote a fix for it :

*"Fixed a client crash that could previously have been avoided by turning off multithreading. If you disabled multithreading, it can now be enabled again."*

So till that time disable it and you'll be fine :-) Worked for me too </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 34, 35 in 3 weeks. I do feel the same when it comes to 16 y/o kids (no offense to the actual 16 y/o but trust me on this, you're not the same person as you're gonna be 20 years from now. And yeah, you're a kid, not a grown-up) and the way they communicate (or they ignite all of a sudden) BUT I don't put people on my ignore list if they want to pay in mixed currency. Can't blame 'm for asking. If they keep pestering you, sure, then the ignore list is fine.

But all in all, people should chill out more. It's a game ya know </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahaha there is a fix if your GF broke up, just get another one, it's even easier than OP's problem ;-)

But on a side note, 95% of the crashes that happen in PoE right now is the multithreading issue, which can be turned off in the options screen </TEXT>
