	<TEXT>  Virgin birth, resurrection, healing the blind, Jonah surviving inside of a "giant fish" for 3 days, Noah's ark, Adam and Eve, the world created in 6 days - all 

With things like the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, and Jesus's miraculous healings, I think Sir George Gabriel Stokes is helpful: 

*"Now we know very well that a man may in general act uniformly according to a certain rule, and yet for a special reason may on a particular occasion act quite differently. We cannot refuse to admit the possibility of something analogous taking place as regards the action of the Supreme Being. If we think of the laws of nature as self-existent and uncaused, then we cannot admit any deviation from them. But if we think of them as designed by a Supreme Will, then we must allow the possibility of their being on some particular occasion suspended."*

Now, if this is the case then why is Sidney Miller's [classic cartoon](http://www.readingreality.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sidney-Harris-Miracle.jpg) still funny?

I think the answer here is that it's very easy to see how a miracle can be a contrived or abitrary explanation. However, this is not the same thing as to say that miracles are *intrinsically incompatible* with science. </TEXT>

Yes, and people often commit grave evils and it actually *is* their fault, too.

 to me "almighty" means that nothing is impossible.

As far as I am aware, virtually every serious Christian thinker throughout history has held that omnipotence cannot extend to the logically impossible, because statements like "could God make a married bachelor?" are ultimately incoherent statements. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, hell has traditionally been taken to primarily consist of the lack of the vision of God, an end which is utterly disproportionate to our natural state, and which requires God's grace dwelling in us to attain.

So I don't think that it's the case that God just arbitrarily wills for a person who stubbornly refuses to worship God to go to a place called hell, even though they would have otherwise inherited eternal life: it's that it's literally impossible for anybody to inherit eternal life, having cast out God's grace from their heart.

Secondly, any other penalties that are experienced in hell would be proportional to one's sins, so I don't think God can be faulted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Christopher Hitchens once said, along the same lines as your objection

*I used to wonder when I was a kid, what would it be like praising God and thanking him all day and all night? Well, now I know because North Korea is a completely worshipful state. It's set up only to do that, for adoration and its only one short of a trinity. They have a father and the son, as you know, the Dear Leader and the Great Leader."*

He goes on to ask Who would really want this?

I think we can unpack this objection by asking: why is the self-aggrandisement of the North Korean leaders so bad, anyway?

Let me submit that it is because there is an incongruency between the way they are presented and the way they really are:

To ascribe to Kim Jong Il that, for example, he is the true source of all good things in North Korea seems wrong because it is ultimately, an untruth: he is but a sinful fellow creature.

That is, it's so absurd precisely because he is **not God.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In this context, the word "mutation" refer to a change in the sequence of nucleotide bases which composes an organism's genome.

Biologists speak of mutations being "random" and by this, it is not meant that every base has an equal probability of 
mutation: rather it refers to the probability of a mutation occuring at any given base not being affected by whether the mutation will confer selective advantage or disadvantage in its current environment.

"Selection" refers to sequences which confer a selective advantage increasing in frequency in a population. For example, a mutation which confers a resistance to an antibiotic will increase in frequency in a population of bacteria exposed to an antibiotic. That is, those individuals which possess the trait will be "selected" by the set of environmental conditions.

Another type of selection which operates is "kin selection". Consider a sequence which confers the trait "help closely related individuals". By the fact that closely related individuals are more likely to carry the altruism-promoting sequence, that sequence is able to increase in frequency in a population.

As far as I am aware, it remains controversial among  biologists whether selection operates on higher levels (e.g. group or species selection) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   they are all post facto. Of course rocks are found in layers. Of course genes are similar in different organisms

On the topic of post facto predictions, I agree that predictions which are "risky" and made before the fact are certainly *more* valuable, but to make predictions in the sense of being able to point out how your theory might explain certain observations after they have been observed is also valuable too in science, isn't it?

For example, Ernst Mayr claimed in 1963 that,

*"Much that has been learned about gene physiology makes it evident that the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives."*

However, as molecular biology progressed in the 20th century, it then became apparent that this search was manifestly *not futile*.

Surely you would agree that it's not fair to say "Mayr got it wrong, therefore this is a "failed prediction of evolution" because there are at least two possible stances one could take on this as a proponent of evolution:

1. Evolution happened, and works in a manner such that sequence similarity is unlikely between two organisms which aren't very closely related

2. Evolution happened, and works in a manner such that sequence similarity is not unlikely between two organisms which aren't very closely related </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One can't define something into existence.

I agree, and I'm not trying to do that. What I'm trying to do is to address an objection which purports to show the incoherence of Christianity. 

In Scripture, humans are exhorted to worship God.

Some claim that any being which exhorted humans to worship Him would be unworthy of worship, and thus Christianity is incoherent.

I fully acknowledge that, if I have addressed this objection, then that doesn't prove that God exists: all it does is address a potential objection to Christianity.

How is this "trying to define God into existence"? </TEXT>

1. To glorify God.

2. By God's grace, when we persevere and worship Him, we are sowing seeds that will be reaped in eternity. It is fitting for us and to our own benefit that we worship God. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems to me that this objection stems from looking at something like the self-aggrandisement of the North Korean leaders, which seems so incongruous, and then saying "Why isn't it just a bigger version of that?"

I think that this incongruency arises because there is a disconnect between the way these people are presented and the way they really are:

To ascribe to Kim Jong Il that, for example, he is the true source of all good things in North Korea seems wrong because it is ultimately, an untruth: he is but a sinful fellow creature.

That is, it's so absurd precisely because worship is only due to God and they are not God. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> selling land (Lev 25:23

The land that is being prohibited from being sold there is the land of Israel, and the intent of that passage is clearly that Israel, having being rescued from destruction in Egypt and given that land by God, was to dwell in that region to fulfill His covenant purposes. It was not some blanket ban on anybody selling land, ever. 

This isn't some fundamentalist dodge: I can guarantee that this would be the answer that you would get from any mainstream biblical scholar, whether they be Christian, Jewish, irreligious or otherwise.

I implore you to consider that this topic might be worth investigating in further detail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a frequent occurence on a forum like reddit, to see somebody pipe up saying something like "Hi, expert here. I went to Catholic school for [x] years and I know it's all bunk." and then they will go on to give some woeful objection. 

To be sure, there are more challenging critics out there, but plenty of irreligious Westerners (especially in Europe and Australia, in my view) seem to have an overinflated sense of their "exposure" to Christian thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   the result is obvious.

I realise that "nobody could possibly be anything but irreligious unless they were indoctrinated in childhood" is one of those tropes that educated Westerners are now expected to nod sagely at, but it really seems to be more like a mantra which has seeped through popular culture than anything. Frankly, it always seems to be accompanied by "nobody could believe in [crude uninformed parody] unless they were indoctrinated as a child." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A major road was closed for a running race, and it was closed for longer than expected, so many in the congregation were late or absent. Unfortunately, this included the organist booked for the day. I was all set to cantor the Communion setting, and play a piece on trumpet during communion, but this wasn't possible. We switch to a Communion setting that is entirely congregational. We sang the first couple of hymns a cappella, with somebody starting us off with a note from a piano app on their phone. Thankfully, another organist turned up halfway through the service, but it was still frustrating.

Nevertheless, God was honored through our worship and the Eucharist was celebrated.

Our last hymn was "He Who Would Valiant Be" which is the only hymn I know of to include a reference to hobgoblins.

An interesting thing: three boys (aged 8-12 or so) turned up at church. They were from local public housing, and were unaccompanied by adult guardians. I think they had been hanging around the church's grounds on Saturday, and our Youth Minister had said that they were welcome to come to Sunday School. 

Our rector and youth minister went off elsewhere in the afternoon so I was sitting in the parish office by myself, and these three young fellows, who had decided to hang around the church grounds, turned up. I made them a cup of tea, and tried to make a bit of conversation. 

It will be interesting to see whether they return.

In the evening, our choir performed the Faure Requiem in its liturgical setting, which went well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  We do see it as worthwhile by definition, because life forms that don't act out of self interest (in a broad sense and on various levels: the gene, the organism, the group, the species,...) will disappear off the face of the earth. It's a biological mechanism.

Let's take the case of a rock with a smiley face painted on. When a person says "it's cruel to heat that rock" we reply to them "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked by the smiley face into thinking that the rock is qualitatively different from other physical systems."

What I'm trying to get at is that, when a naturalist thinks that they have encountered a genuine instance of empathy (i.e. one with a real human, not a rock with a disguise) which provides a justification for treating them differently to an inanimate object, naturalism inescapably leads to the conclusion: "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked into thinking that the human being is qualitatively different from other physical systems which it is clearly **not** cruel to treat in this way (blocks of marble, clouds of helium gas, pools of tar, and so on).

As prominent philosopher of biology Michael Ruse put it: *"If everyone recognized the illusory nature of morality (and could escape from their biology sufficiently to take advantage of this recognition), then very soon people would start to cheat and the whole social system would collapse. Altruism would go and with it would go altruism. Hence, our biology leads us to objectify morality. Ethical skepticism may be the correct philosophy; but our genes are working flat out to make such a conclusion counter-intuitive.*"

To extend the analogy, imagine you asked the person "What is your intellectual justification for saying "don't be
cruel to this rock"? Surely you could see how if they answered "It's so glaringly obvious: I experience a feeling of empathy toward it, and I think that this feeling arises in me because of the evolutionary history of my ancestors"", all they have done is **described** certain experiences they have: they
haven't actually provided any justification. </TEXT>
