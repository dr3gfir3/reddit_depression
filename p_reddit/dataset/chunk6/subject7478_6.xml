	<TEXT> I started a channel where I play music on my face. Like this https://youtu.be/74cST8xUZYg.

Was thinking about tackling the First Contact theme song for tomorrow if there is any interest. Primarily I am doing video game music. But Star Trek is something I would break tradition for! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me it was when Zach was talking. and she says "But my mom's sick. And I get scared sometimes to be at home with her at night. Because I'm scared she can't make it. And I'm worried that if she goes" then pauses... and continues "...when she goes"

I went and watched it again today. What they thought was the Dragonzord was actually Goldar. The green flash appears to be when Rita leaves Goldar's chest to attack the Ranger thats in the dream sequence. I also think that the fly over at the beginning is actually Zordon's ship crashing into Earth. Could be wrong about that though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder if, in this new PR universe, that Rita ripped the Zeo crystal out of Mars before the other Rangers could stop her, and they made their last stand on Earth. Would be interesting to see a prequel showing how she became bad, and what other damage she did before she was ultimately stopped. </TEXT>
