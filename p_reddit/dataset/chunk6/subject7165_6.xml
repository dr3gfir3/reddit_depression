	<TEXT>  In Tennessee a bill is currently under consideration by the state Senate which would give civil immunity for the driver of an automobile who injures a protester who is blocking traffic in a public right-of-way if the driver was exercising due care.

This one seems particularly ridiculous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the article noted, these bills, if passed, would most likely be unconstitutional.  

If any of these bills become law (which the article says that some have), I would be more than happy to personally "test" the laws, get arrested, then be party to any lawsuit on constitutional grounds.  Who is with me? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Are films becoming more visual and cinematic in the 2010s? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-07 19:31:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> More visually laden, long silences, and not as dependent on plot and dialog?

More contemplative, more scenery?

What would you say this would be more distinct from films of the first decade of the century? How would you say film has evolved since 2001?

Such as the films of Nicolas W. Refn.

And Under the Skin (2014), Enemy (2013).

Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Fox and Friends now have the ear of a feeble minded and easily influenced President of the United States. So while the network may not succeed in brainwashing many, they are extremely influential and are currently helping to shape US domestic and foreign policy.

This is something we have to keep an eye on, for sure.  (It's still unclear, however, how much personal influence Trump has on actually crafting policy.)  Respectfully speaking, and I do appreciate your thoughts, this does go a bit beyond the scope of the OP, which concerned the electorate, not state policy.  But yeah, I agree with you, with the caveat that the President seems to watch all manner of cable news, not just Fox.  Didn't Elijah Cummings get the President to contact him based on an MSNBC "shout out"? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  As for today's influence, I don't believe their intent is to win over new votes as much; It was to create and now to reinforce a mindset in their viewers which demands party affiliated purity over reason, debate, and compromise on policy.

I totally agree with you here.  (In my opinion) Fox's influence is manifest on *internal* Republican affairs, particularly in heavily gerrymandered districts. </TEXT>
