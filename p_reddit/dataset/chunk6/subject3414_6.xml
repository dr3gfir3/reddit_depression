	<TEXT> My mother is disabled, she has a walking stick, but when she has a 'bad day', she will use a walking frame. She gets dirty looks all the time. My mum puts a lot of effort into her appearance, it will take her 3 hours to get ready of a daily basis because of her disease, she has to take a lot of breaks, hence the long time. People see her and think shes looks fine, why does she get disabled parking, and why does she have a walking stick. 
It was hard for me to grow up with people constantly giving her dirty looks and so on, I am a person who does not put up with peoples shit, so if someone gave/gives her a look, the only thing I do is give them a dirty look, as my mother taught me to not let they get to me. 
There has been a few times where I have let loose on people. 
The worst time was when I was younger, around 16yrs old and acting out, a boy (roughly 16yr old) was with his mother, saw my mum and went up to her,  he kicked the walking stick out from my mum, she fell, and they ran away laughing. I ran over, pushed one of the kids down, and kicked him in the nuts, I walked up to his mother and told her I hope her kids balls drop of so he doesn't reproduce another pathetic asshole like himself. One of the staff members ran to my mums help, while I kicked the kid. Everytime we go to the that store, man who helped my mum, still helps her today. Its good to know some people out there really do care about others. 
So thats my side of it. 
On the other hand for my dad, its hard for him. He gets embarrassed by mum having to use a walking stick, and wheelchair/walking frame. 
He wants to live life to the fullest before he gets old, but is unable to because of mum. So its hard of him. Also he is the main provider for the family as my mum is unable to work. He has a job but is on casual employment due to the wages being better, which is good and bad. Wages are better, but it means if he gets sick and doesnt get a full weeks work of shifts, there are days without pay. 
My brother and I pitch in with bills and what not, but our parents hate it when we do, as they feel they cant provide a good life for us. 
Its hard on all of us. 

Good luck with it all, I hope your SO gets better soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there!
I am living in Australia and looking at traveling abroad for a year. 
Given we are both Australians, I thought you might be a better person to talk to this about. I have a few questions to ask, I hope you dont mind.
I dont have much money saved at all, how much money did you have saved up before you went overseas? Were you able to work overseas to make a bit of extra cash? Where abouts did you go? Did you stay in mostly hostels, if so, what were they like? Would you recommend anywhere in particular to go? Did you ever find yourself worried or lost in a place where it was unsafe? Did you go alone, if so, how was it, would you have preferred for someone to go with you?   </TEXT>

I remember her from my high school days, she has no idea who I am, but she has always been this way.

	<TEXT> I know the problem!! 
I have long, thick, wavey/bird nesty hair, and I use to loose a lot of hair every day! 
Brushing my hair was the worst, I wouldn't have knots but it still took a lot of strans out. And washing my hair was horrible, I would just get my fingers tangled as I was scrubbing. My mum was having to vacuum the bathroom everyday because there was so my hair everywhere. 
Now I loose basically nothing. 
What stopped it? Super greens and essitial vitamins! 
My hair doesn't come out, only when I get the occasional few strands but that's it :) 
Also it makes my nails nice and strong and grow fast too!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Berry Blast Sorbet Thingy!! 
So quick, so easy! 
I've never done actual measurements, I go buy what I like, but this is what I use: 

1kg Greek Yoghurt 
1kg frozen mixed berries 
3 table spoons of raw extracted honey 
2 table spoons of water 

I put all the above amounts in the processor and evenly distribute in a few containers. So depending on what portions you want, you'll use different ingredient quantities. 

I do this in the morning and let set in the freeze all day until later on in the night! Take out and eat! So simple!! 

You can also take it out early and eat like ice cream as well!  </TEXT>

If a man is very arrogant about his looks, unless the girl is extremely attractive and confident with herself, most people wont go near them.
