	<TEXT> Thanks for responding.  I simply look at the data in this series, and it does speak for itself.  Obviously I can't cover everything, and a story has to be told...the result is what I ended up with.

I appreciate your comments and feedback, however.  Hard to please everyone on Youtube but I'm glad you left me your opinion </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem very hostile at the fact that the video does not cater to your own disposition.  Not only, but your response to my critique is completely hypocritical as your talking points are but a select fraction that serve to amplify your position....which is hypocritical because you accused me of that very thing.

Obviously due to time constraints, not every single piece of data can be looked at.

I will refrain from this conversation thread with you given your very aggressive attitude.  Obviously many people are enjoying the video and the stance at which the data is evaluated.  

In the future, as a person, I recommend you be less toxic in your responses as authors, unlike myself, may attack your word choices.

Best of luck to you. </TEXT>

It failed with a mix reception and declining player and viewer counts.  Currently, there are around 8000 concurrent daily players and around less than 1000 viewers on Twitch.  The most popular Twitch stream when recording had 60 viewers.

	<TEXT> As someone who makes Youtube content myself, I want to say your video is very well done in terms of presentation.  Nice edits and motion graphics.  Your voice is pleasant, however I'd like to recommend working on your intonation.  It can come across as monotone (something I've had to work on).

Otherwise, nicely done. </TEXT>
