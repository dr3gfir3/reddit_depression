	<TEXT> It really depends. I will say that I wouldn't go over 300k on your combined income. I'm not sure what area you're looking in, but in most suburbs 250-275k can go a really really long way. We didn't get everything we wanted right off the bat (I wanted a basement for instance) but at 215k we got enough that if we ran into financial hardship we could still live there 20 years without having to upsize.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It if helps, my wife and I are both engineers with a combined take home of about 150k. We do not have student loans. We purchased a house for $215k, on a 20 year mortgage. We could have afforded more, but it is extremely wise to live below your means. You really never know when you could lose your job, it can happen to anyone at any time. Our situation allows us to save money for our future and our future family while maintaining a safety net that if one of us were to lose our job, we wouldn't be in a position to worry about being foreclosed on.  </TEXT>
