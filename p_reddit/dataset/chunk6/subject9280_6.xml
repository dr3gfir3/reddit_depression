	<TEXT> Thanks man you're gonna make me cry man. It just hurts fucking to the core of your soul to know more than half your life has been experienced in pain. I wish I was tougher, because the past 13 years have only really consisted of hundreds upon hundreds of lost friends, several failed attempts at trying to go to college, and days upon days of doing nothing but dying slowly inside my room. At this point it might not be too late to make friends and finish college, but that's only if I can be healthy. 

I've tried doing all these things while living severely depressed and anxious and with terrible ADD and over 13 years I was never tough enough or strong enough to keep up the fight against my mental
health, and so my life fell apart. And now I'm almost 24 and still don't have an answer to get healthy, and truly now I believe it's likely too late to make good friends or finish college </TEXT>

It hurts to feel so alone and desperate and stuck during such difficult and lonely times, especially as I don't see an end in sight. With this pain going on 13 years strong it's been hard to still see an end in sight year after year, while things continue to only get worse. I want it to get better more than anything, because if not I will end up dead  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Taking Kratom while on T-Cypionate Injections? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-15 13:58:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 23 almost 24, just started weekly Testosterone-Cypionate injections two days ago after finding out I had low T months back. 

I suffer from pretty much almost every symptom of low T, the most difficult being depression and anxiety and I take kratom during really bad times to help me get through. 

I was wondering if anyone here takes or has taken kratom while also on TRT and if it will interfere or not with the TRT doing its job. I've heard before that kratom lowers testosterone but I wasn't sure if that was true or not, so I'm just curious about what people here know regarding these two interacting. Thanks guys, I want the best for all of you ! </TEXT>

What medicine did you try before almost doing ECT, and did it help? I just found out recently my testosterone is low and started Testosterone replacement therapy two days ago but I doubt it will help. I doubt anything will help at all anymore. Everything in my life is completely fucked. </TEXT>

However, I would tell anyone that can sell anything to try it its worth it if this many people are entering remission after each infusion, just make sure you can afford monthly maintenance infusions.

I hope all those suffering from severe treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, ADD, etc. like myself can get help and get better.

We all deserve a second chance, a true hope at redemption and an opportunity to experience life from an existence of peace and love, and not extreme constant fear.  I love you all reddit ! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How would the guy with economically viable clothes have paid as much or more than the people who are wearing more expensive clothes? Are you saying that in reference to a claim that the majority of console players pay as much or more than PC gamers? Because that is just completely untrue. Yes there are tons of console players who buy every game and pay for online. But a majority chunk of console players don't buy online services and buy two games or less a year.  On the other spectrum there's a ton of PC gamers who buy AAA games several times a year and also upgrade their parts, mouse and keyboard, monitors, and more.  Not to mention that a good PC can range from $600-$1000.  Your argument that my analogy is false is not true </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I said has nothing to do with monthly online subscriptions or overpriced games. Don't bring up something completely different from the basis of the argument. I understand console gamers pay for things that are a waste of money. My point though has nothing to do with that. My point is only that the PCMR sub unnecessarily shits on console gamers calling them "peasants" and mocking their "arrogance" when console gamers don't give a fuck about who's better and just want to play games. It's textbook elitism. 

In fact, the ultimate irony is that the guy who coined the term PCMR said it as a dig at the PC gamers who are elitists in a comparison to Nazi Germany's claim of their "master race", and ironically enough the largest PC gaming community, PCMR, took this as their name and wave it proud and high. It started as joke but the entire subreddit doesn't treat it as a joke at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly.  It's absurd how much the people on that subreddit are obsessed with trying to justify their $1500-$2000+ purchases.

I think deep down they're never satisfied and there's a deep jealousy within them of how simple console gamers just seem to be happy with what they have.

I've never met a PC gamer who wasn't constantly thinking about upgrading the parts instead of just playing the fucking games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sub pcmasterrace is originally what got me into PC gaming, and I loved my PC for the last year I've owned it. Now I need to get into my other hobbies more seriously and decided to sell my PC as serious gaming isn't for me, which is okay, to each his own. 

However, that subreddit which I thought was just about the love of high graphics, framerates, and such turned out to be a subreddit just filled with too many angry dudes who keep shitting on console owners who they claim are saying "console is better than PC." 

I've never met one console owner who goes on about how his console is superior to a PC in terms of gaming. When I meet console owners the only thing they tell me is "what game do you wanna play?" or "check out this new game I got." 

Yet, every PC owner I meet just goes on about the PC's expensive GPU and CPU and about how much RAM and how many fans it has.

The dudes on PC master race are obsessed with creating this faux war so they can make themselves feel good about something. They're obsessed with making this faux war larger and larger so they can feel like supreme winners about something in their life. In reality 99% of console owners have no awareness of this "war" and just continue playing their games and going on with life. 

I understand that PC owners want to make people aware that they are often getting jipped by the corporations and that there's a way to play that exists with better graphics and such. Still, in every industry there's people who are getting better and often more expensive products than others, but aren't taking the time to shit on those who have lesser, shittier products.

For example, I've never seen a group of dudes with nicer clothes come together and circle jerk about a guy with a lower budget wearing clothes from a more economically viable retailer. I've never seen a BMW owner go on to a dude with a low budget Honda about how he needs to install "cool-air intake" and a "body kit" onto his Accord.

PC Gaming is cool. The masterrace subreddit is cool at times. But the incessant angry dudes need to chill the F out.

	<TEXT> So sorry for your predicament, from a fellow N64 fan to a fellow human brother, I'm sorry you're in this fucked up situation.  I'm hoping it all works out.  And know I've been there before too and there's almost always a way for it to work out.  

If you don't find luck selling here but them up on eBay and they'll always be a buyer.  It might not sell for the best price if you have to sell quicker, but it will sell 100% </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I say it will be everyone that's ever been on the podcast.  It'll be a giant auditorium and they'll all sit in a circle.

Unfortunately hundreds of arguments will break out, particularly when Alex Jones tells Amy Schumer that she's a product of the Hollywood psychic vampire paedaphiles, and Ronda Rousey tries to take on Eddie Bravo but Eddie unleashes chemtrails from his ass and destroys her, all while James Hetfield lets out a resounding "YEEAHHH!".  

Meanwhile Jamie's fingers will be bleeding by an hour in after having "pulled up" a record 6,000 videos, and the livestream will have over 100,000 continuous viewers.

Joe will rake in the dough and ONNIT will sell out of Alpha Brain within minutes of the usual "...and thats O-N-N-I-T..."

You know, just your usual JRE podcast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too have had depression, anxiety, ADD, and severe anhedonia since childhood.  Over the last many years I've tried about 12 or so antidepressants, talk therapy, TMS therapy, ketamine infusions, ADD medicines, different supplements, exercise, occasional meditation, and lifestyle changes.  I've never gotten better, only progressively worse.

I'm currently 23 almost 24 and every single way you described life is how I too experience it day in day out.  I'm so sorry you're suffering and have been suffering for a long time through the same torturous hell.  Mentally I want to do everything, I want to eat foods, I want to socialize, and play sports, and my guitar, and have sex, and explore the amazing things life has, but 24/7 365 I physically in my body feel no real appetite, no desire to do any hobbies, socialize, have sex, or anything.  Everything I do provides me the same joy as if I've been staring at a rock for hours.  It's the most underratedly worst hell and way of being alive.  Every moment of my life feels as if I'm sitting in a waiting room with no form of entertainment or anything and just the wall to stare at while I wait, in this case for eternity.

I'm hoping to get testosterone replacement therapy because I just found out my T is low, but the issue is docs won't give me TRT because the system is very screwed up so I found a clinic which might treat me but I'm not sure yet.  Moreover, even though the T is important I believe it won't help my anhedonia and depression significantly because I've lost hope in anything doing that.  And I'm really in the same situation you are, in that I've tried almost everything, so now what?  I also heard psilocybin can help and I'm definitely gonna try that, but tbh I was told the same thing for a long time about ketamine infusions and they didn't help me at all, so I don't have any hope anything will help.

Living this way is truly terrible and I really haven't been surviving.  If I don't find something that helps soon I won't stick around much longer.  Life is not worth living like this.  Not one day is filled with joy.  Only deep dark lonely pain.  The only thing thats ever gotten me through has been that I believed something would work for me and get me healthy, but now I don't believe that anymore.  

I hope things go okay with you and I'll pm you my phone number in case you want a digital pen pal to message with because its so hard going this alone. I'm here for you

	<TITLE> My Top 5 Metallica songs </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-02 05:27:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In no particular order because they're all so perfect in different ways it's so hard to compare songs which fit different categories. In my opinion these five songs are all written perfectly and deserve five out of five stars each for what they manage to achieve in the sound/vibe they're going after.  In parentheses I explain in my opinion what each song is best at in their catalog. I would love to hear your guys' opinions and what your top songs are and why:

Fade to Black (their most emotionally gut-wrenching and saddest song, plus the most melodic Metallica solo ever imo with the opening Kirk solo)

Master of Puppets (imo it's their most epic thrash masterpiece and truly the best classic-themed thrash song ever made)

Creeping Death (such a fucking intense and rapid thrash experience, and imo the best written Metallica solo and metal solo of all time)

Nothing Else Matters (their song which reaches your heart and breaks through all bullshit that could possibly exist and makes you remember who you are. this song could motivate a person to face any and every fear they could possibly encounter, to destroy anybody or anything that tries to get in the way of what's important to them, and personally this song pumps adrenaline into my veins and makes me feel alive and completely unafraid of anything when I hear it)

One (without a doubt their most intense, grittiest, darkest, and overall rage filled track that they ever wrote. The first half is an amazing lead up, and when the song begins to shift and the guitars go fucking epic playing those intense machine gun chords I literally lose my mind. That stuff showcases Metallica's most fucking intense and angriest music ever. Imo, this song was the pinnacle of Metallica's ascendence into harder and grittier music. They began with punk style thrash in Kill Em' All and transitioned to harder music with each progressive album, culminating in ...And Justice For All being their hardest and most intense album. So intense and gritty that I think it was just natural that The Black Album was them lowering back down to earth after producing their most intense album previously)

	<TEXT> u/blindcolumn you're extremely lucky you're anhedonia has subsided and I'm so pleased to hear another soul isn't suffering.  It truly is hell

/u/Pongpianskul I've been going for about 13 years now of suffering severe anhedonia, and 7-8 years of it being extremely severe.  I've tried legit almost everything under the sun for treatment with no success.  It is truly the worst hell I've ever endured and I don't think it will ever end.  

If any of you are familiar with the song ["One"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT6vqeL-ysI) by Metallica, it's about a man who loses all his limbs, his hearing, and his vision from a landmine in a war.  He can't do or really experience anything anymore, but his mind is fully conscious and awake and he is only suffering with silence and never-ending emptiness.  Still, he can't kill himself or communicate for someone to kill him because he has no limbs and cannot speak or see.  He is stuck living in hell and cannot escape.  This is how I feel every moment of my life, because I can't kill myself but all I experience is never-ending emptiness.  This song helps a bit, but then again, nothing ever truly helps rid this emptiness... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't be sad! They should hopefully work! I just want to let you know because many people fall into a trap where they find one that's working and then think the medicine will never poop out, but it happens very often unfortunately.  Again I'm not trying to put you down, I'm just saying so you can line up more antidepressant treatment options ahead of time in case this one ever stops working.

Doctors neglect to tell you these things and its very unfortunate because when the medicine stops working people have no idea what's going on and they waste so much time feeling shitty when it really could just be time to up the dose or switch to a new medicine. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Questions about 2015 Macbook 12" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-27 23:53:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I currently have a 2011 11" Macbook Air and the trackpad is having tiny issues that I don't like and the fan gets so loud from basic things and I'm likely going to sell it on eBay.  I bought it last year for very very cheap on eBay and can probably sell it and break even from what I originally paid.

For my next computing device I don't want a tablet or windows laptop because I very much like MacOS and how smooth my experience with it has always been for years including with apps like Pages, Mail, TextEdit, and so many other things.  I also can't use a mobile architecture like on iOS or an iPad because I need basic file creation and Finder as a must.

I mainly use my laptop for web browsing, Youtube, Netflix, listening to music on iTunes and spotify, studying with flashcards with Anki, word processing, and small things like rosetta stone and Mail.  I love having a lightweight and small computer and I think the Macbook 12" 2015 model is perfect and I found some on eBay for $700 in good condition.

**I just have a couple questions for anyone who has owned one:**

1. I know it's fanless and therefore silent, but does it still overheat regularly and from common things like the Macbook 11" does?
1. Is the battery life good? On my Macbook 11" I usually only get about three hours
1. Is the different style keyboard better or worse? and can you get used to it easily?
1. What do you do in a scenario where you need the charger to be plugged in so you can also backup to an external harddrive, even though you only have one USB port?

Thanks guys. Would love to hear any other experiences, comments, or good and bad things about this device and whether you recommend I get it.

	<TEXT> thank you, that's definitely true, I did read that 24/25 is the peak age.  My doctors truly are failing me.  I can't believe how much when I was younger I believed that doctor's words were cannon and that they couldn't be ignorant or wrong.  WOW do I know that's not true now after all these years of being led down the wrong treatment paths.

I will try to get a second opinion, I just have concerns that either the doctors will to be too expensive or won't prescribe me TRT to begin with </TEXT>
