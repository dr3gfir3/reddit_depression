	<TITLE> Small tax return: Am I Using it Optimally? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-23 16:29:04 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone.

I have read the "Read this First: How to Handle $" information but I just wanted to double check that I'm making the best use of my little tax return.  I am using You Need a Budget as well (new one, I'm new to all this).

I'm getting $1470 back.  I have $250 in chequing, $430 on my credit card, and the $500 I had for emergency fund I just invested in retirement savings (canadian), which I had never had before.

My thoughts for splitting this up:
- pay off credit card first
- put $500 in emergency fund (and build from there)
- put the rest into chequing and give those dollars jobs like home maintenance or auto maintenance, creating a bit of a buffer and insulating me against any minor expenses that might come up.

With all this YNAB and Personal Finance research I've done I've realized I was drastically overspending each month and have barely enough to work with after obligations.

Anyway, I know this is super small beans compared to a lot of posts here, but I just wanted to know if I'm doing this right or I should be doing something totally different.  Thanks. </TEXT>
