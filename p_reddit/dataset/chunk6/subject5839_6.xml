	<TEXT> hm... thanks for the suggestion but I think I'll pass..
Any expansion would work for me really. Even if it is Vanilla (might be fun). 

But if there is NO instant PVP that is good atm, what is the best server you would recommend "dawsondaddy"? like people are actually investing their time HEAVILY on pvp.. 3 (TBC server would be so fucking neat though :'o ) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> fuck, all I want is some pvp in my blood. so that's really my only option?

Hawkes mentioned Lordaeron, how about it?
And there's some pvp servers that is on top-list websites such as "wow-circle" or "pvp-tournament"  or "retro wow"
are these any good?
thanks btw

	<TEXT> oh. so these are actually the only one's?
But is Lordaeron a strictly PVP?

By blackrock, you mean it is Warmane's blackrock? The population is only about 700 atm though.. so there's no server that was as big as arena tournament I guess? </TEXT>
