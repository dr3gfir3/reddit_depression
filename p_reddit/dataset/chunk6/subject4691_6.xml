	<TEXT> Yea, I have an appointment coming up in a few weeks and I am going to go over how I am feeling. Tonight I took my dose right before bed and now I am up at 3:00 am and I am never up at this time. I like the energy it gives me but I think I need to find a time where taking it will work for me. When do you take yours? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on Wellbutrin 100 mg. for about two months and yes it helped sexually but it deffenitly gave me more anxiety. I don't want to discourage you to try it though because it might be right for you. I just started Viibryd so I hope it works because I am sick of the roller coaster of changing meds. Ugh!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I am so happy you took the time to respond! I recently started a new non-dairy diet and there is little to no protein in it.  I think that might be what is contributing to my joint pain and muscle weekness.  I stopped meditating last week and that has also contributed to my anxiety. I am getting back to taking care of my body like you said. Thanks again and I hope you have a awesome day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This year I found out I may or may not have familial Amyloidosis. I have not been tested yet because the test is 600.00.  Ever since I found out that I have a 50% chance of having this my Hypochondria has gotten a LOT worse and so has my anxiety. I  currently on 3 meds: 100 mg Wellbutrin, 5 mg Lexapro, and 3x daily Buspar.  To make this post short I have been having muscle weakness and joint pain. I am guessing its from stress but I am completely unsure. Does anyone else have these symptoms from stress or from a side effect of any of the drugs I am taking? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been SLOWLY working my way through a RA Salvatore book that is pretty new. I have read ALL of his other books. I've read some Dean Koontz (sorry if its spelled wrong) I haven't been reading much because of Netflix, Youtube, REDDIT :) I also have not been doing much art and I know reading helps get my creative juices flowing. So I guess what I am asking is of a book that will captivate me from the beginning and get me out of this funk I'm in. I would love something exciting but it does not need to be fantasy. Any ideas out there? I have a library right down the road so it shouldn't be a problem to get ahold of something. </TEXT>
