	<TEXT> I kinda agree with you but not in the way you said. EU, US, and China arent a direct threat to Russia like Russian propaganda makes them out to be. 

Rather they are threat to Russia because they have succeeded where Russia failed, and it raises the question to normal questions *why arent we successful like them*. The answer of course is their own leadership. However, their leadership distracts them by making these countries seem actively out to get Russia and blaming them for their own failures. The thing is I think the Russian leadership actually believes this idea, they have always been paranoid so they go out of their way to try and make everywhere else like Russia. If EU, US, etc. were just as bad as Russia than maybe things arent so bad in Russia. 

Unfortunately GOP want US to be like Russia.  </TEXT>

I never supported HRC, she is just long gone and reminiscing about how much you hate her is the only way you can come to term with Trump's failures and how he let you down. 

It is sad to watch. For your sake you better hope Trump isnt 8 years, because the shortcoming of Trumpet lives will only get worse. Trump is basically what he accused HRC of being. You basically voted for a demented male version of HRC, and your only coping mechanism is remembering HRC. #sad </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the decline in Russia is not from US or EU. It is rotting internally. The economy never recovered from the collapse of USSR and the only reason Russia looked to be improving was the high price of gas. Now that it collapsed Russia is declining again. Russia lost its influence in CIS because it really has nothing to offer other than bribes, cheap gas, or weapons or military support. It has little cultural, economic, or technological capital like more advanced countries because it lacks the climate to generate these things. 

The issue is the Russian leadership has never acknowledged the rot in Russia is from Russian oligarchs and elite class, and not from outside forces so they spend all their energy and wealth to make trouble abroad while russia collapses internally. Russia is really good at makijg havoc in other countries but it doesnt solve the problems of Russia so Russia finds itself in chaos too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Russia did do this, but the real culprit is the GOP for weakening democracy. Russia didnt create this rabid anti-intellectualism and low information voters or partisanship. The GOP did. 

Russia just exploited how weakened our democracy was from the GOP and the stupidity of GOP voters. 

Honestly, Russia is really doing us a favor here. Our democracy has become a joke, and this is due mostly to the GOP who has became undemocratic, racist, theocratic, and authoritarian decades ago. It is time people realized the system doesnt work.  </TEXT>

I honestly think he did us a favor in the long run. The fact that the GOP is the way it is, the EC system, and such shows how bad our democracy has gotten. It was never perfect but this is probably the lowest its ever been, the fact that they could so easily exploit the GOP shows how much the GOP has corrupted democracy. 

Russia had bad intentions but it could end up improving our democracy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ? 

Not sure what you are saying. 

My guess is you meant to say that most Americans agree more with democrats on economic issues, which is true since Republican economic policy is just tax cuts for the rich. 

THe GOP is out of touch with 99% of Americans since its policies are just geared toward the insanely rich or theocratic evangelist, and it uses racism to get people to support a party they agree 99% against. So yes I agree with you here. 

On most issues 99% of the people would agree more with the Democrats, except the racial issues which is all the GOP has to give tax cuts to the rich. It isnt even really a party anymore since tax cuts for less than 1% of the population is not an ideology.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The book would have been OK had she not repeated the same 3 scenerios  over and over 400 times. 

Basically all her characters fall into 4 categories,  a good category and 3 bad and the whole book is the good category talking with the bad ones one at a type over and over. The lesson and point is the same just the situation changes. 

I can ignore her insane philisophy and just focus on the literature and if the book was half its length than it would be ok. This is ignoring her stupid worldview which is insane. 

So to summarize. The philisophy behind the book is pretty bad. The book is pretty bad as a book. I don't et the hype.  </TEXT>

Your logic is flawed.

	<TEXT> Not at all. Your earlier statement is refuted. Bush didn't have an abnormal amount of fillibusters. 

It isn't good or bad it is just Republicans like to put more extremist in power and they get fillibustered  more. 

It is based I guess if you want judges to rule based off religion belief, racial identity, or ideology and not law. That is the point of fillibuster to make it so a minority can block a extremist judge and they can compromise on a moderate judge they both can agree upon. The only ones that have a problem with this are Republicans  </TEXT>

So even felons or children who can't vote have their vote given to whoever wins. If 51% of the population voted for one candidate and 49% for the other than EC will treat 100% as having voted for that candidate. It encourages people not to vote in nonswing  states.  </TEXT>

not everyone is as scummy as the gop. It is sad because the party did have some dignity in the past but it is just awful in almost every way. Corrupy, racist, hateful, greedy, ignorant, and undemocratic trying to stop actual democracy and voting. And they aren't even antigovernment. They love big government when it is to force you to follow their extremist religion positions, giving money to the rich, etc. They just don't want government helping normal people.  </TEXT>

Let's say California got its fair share of votes and a candidate wins California with 70% of the vote. EC would treat California as if 100% of the population voted for this candidate. 

It should just be popular vote.  </TEXT>
