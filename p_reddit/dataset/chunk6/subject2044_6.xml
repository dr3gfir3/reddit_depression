	<TEXT> The scenes where they investigate LV426, they could be spliced into a modern film and no-one would know (if they hadn't seen Alien of course). Weirdly, I think Prometheus will date much faster than Alien. The only other film that I feel is as timeless is Deliverance. Apart from a few small things, the natural setting, photography, story and dialogue haven't dated at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the UK Odeon do this thing called ScreenUnseen where you see mystery previews for 5, weeks ahead of general release. They've shown stuff like Revenant, Nightcrawler, Demolition, Arrival, Manchester By The Sea, Moonlight and Get Out. One of my favourites was It Follows. The experience is so unique and fun because you really don't know much about the movie you're going to see, and you share the novelty with the rest of the audience who's up for a bit of random entertainment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the point is that he barely knows Kevin. He didn't really know him then, and much less so now - he just *imagines* a connection because of what happened. That's why its tragic to watch unfold. Its misplaced and naive - but thats because by then Chiron is so sexually immature and inexperienced.  

He becomes frail and vulnerable because hes anchored back to that moment as a kid. He hasn't learned to deal with or accept his own sexuality, so the moment he goes there, he regresses back to that moment. Anyone who builds a facade like that will have moments of regression where they're anchored back to their more vulnerable self - its a mistake to think this is caused by *love* and in my opinion an overly simplistic interpretation of the scene.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting, I agree with you. I read before seeing that it was a film about growing up, being a man, finding yourself, accepting yourself, and was expecting something within Chiron to stand forth and take ownership of his trajectory. But that never happened.   

So after his lack of a caring parent and acceptance growing up (although he still *had* moments of raw acceptance, which not everyone does), he never develops the confidence to remotely embrace or explore his sexuality, against all his instincts, and despite finding confidence in other areas, until *years* later. Then he selfishly reaches out to someone on the back of some misunderstood clumsy moment masquerading as affection, despite that persons own development and life stability. It felt like a very cynical exploration of the human condition, basically telling us that life circumstances can trap a person beyond their power to see beyond it. Thats great, and probably true, but I'm not sure its the message that people need who might be in that situation. It offers no causal power of its own to influence people in a positive way.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure the film was trying to say that at all, and certainly not hinting at anything resembling "love". "Deep and affectionate love" are you kidding me? Kevin wanked him off on a beach with no real affection at all, then joins in bullying and sending Chiron's life on a trajectory. Chiron reaching out to Kevin isn't really anything to do with love, but a desperate need for (misplaced) connection. Kevin really doesn't care by this point, he pities Chiron and has his own life sorted out. I saw it more about how people end up unwittingly using each other for selfish gratification, and the complex consequences of that.  

I saw a great film recently called Disconnect (2012) with a subplot that touched similar themes. Two school kids connect with another online they're trying to bully, and it has grave consequences. Weaved within though is a lot of subtext about one of the bully's own vulnerability and causality, who secretly empathises and admires his victim. It actually moved me far more than Moonlight, it was subtle but explored the ideas in the context of a much bigger exploration of connection, selfishness, the fragility of love etc. For me, Moonlight in contrast felt much *lesser* than the sum of its parts, but I'm glad you got a lot out of it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. The build up was so well paced and subtle in how it gradually upped the ante, I didn't realise how much my emotions had built up until that moment smashed them. As well as the tech colliding with humanity theme, I loved the exploration of what affects intimacy. Some of the relationship trajectories (e.g. Boyd father realising he doesn't know his son, how consequences of losing a wife or son affect relationships) felt so refreshingly well drawn and real, without forcing the audience to take sides. Such a great film.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This film was amazing. It felt like an extended Black Mirror episode with the structure of Crash (2004), but more about a theme of how distant, anonymous connections collide with intimate, familial ones (kind of). The acting, characters, writing, editing and directing were all excellent. It deserved a best picture nominee, and is certainly a lot better than Crash. There's a plot strand that I found far more moving and honest than the whole of Moonlight. 

Edit: [IMDB link](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433811/) (scored 7.6).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would love to have seen a version that was more like the original Westworld. I find all the characters in JP cartooney and unrealistic - Richard Attenborough's pompous scientist acting like his Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th St, Laura Dern looking at dinosaur shit like fairies were dancing on it, the annoying kids. All those glances between Sam and Laura with Laura smiling about the kids - its vomit inducing. The guy trying to steal the eggs, ugh. Weirdly Sam Jackson feels like the more grounded character of the bunch and I would never normally say that about a film with Sam Jackson. If it had more mature, grounded characters across the board, some wealthy older investors who visit the park, and then darkness and rain falls and they get chased/maimed/eaten and find their pretentious wealth douchiness gets stripped away as they survive and struggle through mud and blood, I'd have much preferred it. I want it looking like the gorier moments of The Descent, having the suspense and excitement of Aliens, and the survivalist elements of the last section of Predator.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My problem here is that too many films are being released where scripts are serving some existing structure, be it a sequel, universe or whatever, rather than *telling a story that's worth telling*. I would never enjoy a film purely because it belonged to some universe, and only would if it told a *good story worth telling*. Split kind of did the opposite in telling a story and then shoe-horning it into an existing universe, which I feel mixed about. Its cute, but its not necessary to the story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always noticed that. Also, his rock is enough to crack the pipe, but how the hell does he create a big enough hole for his body to get through? If the pipe goes so easily to the outside (and by that, I mean in a straight line), why has a reverse situation never happened where someone crawls *in*, uses tool to create a hole in the pipe, chips away at the wall to break someone out? Why was his chipped away hole so flippin' big and circular, why not just what was necessary to crawl out? Why wasn't a draft blowing from the outside through the hole and the loose poster? How did Andy know there would be a lightning storm the night he wore the governer's shoes out and took his accounts? Wasn't it a bit of a risk to take the shoes anyway, Red's thing of "when do you ever notice a guys shoes" isn't exactly realistic when the warden's ears are used to hearing a non-cloppy prison-issue shoe? How did Andy know his cell was next to a room with a man-size sewer pipe that led directly (and in a straight line) to the outside? What if he spent decades building that hole then they switched his cell?  

All is forgiven though for that bit where the governer holds his hammer-concealing bible and says "redemption lies within". Classy.      </TEXT>

I was quite into films then (I was proud of my Kubrick collection, Westworld and Blood Simple ex-rentals), and was expecting Jurassic Park to be far more grittier and sinister like Westworld. I hated the shiny self-consciousness and those stupid bratty kids. Even Sam Neill and Goldblum just felt like self-conscious actors in a sure-fire blockbuster. I've watched it a few times since and really wanted to love it as everyone else does, but it always feels too forced and childish.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Conversation is such a great film. You will probably like The Lives of Others, a german film about stasi surveillance in the Eastern bloc. Its excellently written, suspenseful and really soulful. Also, Darren Aronofsky's Pi fits your paranoid character remit, and definitely Jacob's Ladder which is a superbly paranoid horror/thriller that works on multiple levels.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hated it on first viewing and almost left the cinema out of boredom. Now its one of my favourite films. I find all Coen films are such "worlds" that you need to gently explore them over time to fully appreciate them. Fargo and No Country are also very much like this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to have the IPD as wide as it would go (my eyes are normal btw), then the focus set so the lenses were fairly close. I had it like that for a whole year, before discovering that I could set the IPD to be closer, but the lenses further away. The difference in having the IPD closer is that you get more overlap of a 3D area, but less width overall. I much prefer it this way for using the Cmoar cinema app.  </TEXT>

I wanted to know what you guys (anyone, not just cult members) think about Ted Patrick (deprogrammers) defense in court regarding kidnapping cult members to help them, that their constitutional right to freedom no longer applies because they've been dehumanised? He argued that once someone has been brainwashed and had their ability to think for themselves is removed, they're no longer human, and his job was to help regain their humanity. He felt justified in kidnapping them to that end.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I absolutely LOVE about the Coen's is their use of language and words. Almost all of their films have a world of interesting use of language. Millers Crossing in particular is rammed with weird little phrases that you can't help but start using after seeing it. Even the word "mezzanine" from Hudsucker, or Bruce Campbell saying "what gives?"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another bad example would be Terminator Salvation - but look how terrible his forced performance was in that. And it appeared that he took that *very* seriously from his on-set outbursts. With The Big Short, I loved Carrel's performance, but still found Bale stuck out as a kind of self-conscious actor. I can't put my finger on it, but the way he does his American accent, forces these little nuances etc, it just jars with me subconsciously in the same way as a CGI effect. I just can't buy into it. I haven't seen the Malick films to offer an opinion on unfortunately but glad to hear his performance is raised a bar in those.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's absolutely not true. Hoffman's performance was very consistent, and once he nailed his impression of an autistic guy there really isn't much more to it. Cruise's character evolves and changes, recognises a reservoir of repressed emotions within himself. I really think you're coming from what you remember and imagine the film to be, not how it actually is.  
Edit: left a word out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the films aspects were based on truth, and sometimes real life IS cliched and full of standard tropes. Not every big film needs to be all original though - for me it was refreshing in how unashamed it was to be a solid genre film in an old fashioned way, like a fable. Im honestly surprised how many people bitch and whine about all these pedantic aspects without just appreciating the amazing story of Desmond Doss and how solidly Gibson brought it to the screen.  </TEXT>

When watching it though, I thought "oh, becoming a kind of vigilante detective to get back some homely thing that was stolen, that reminds me of Big Lebowski". Then when Eli Wood's character is gung-ho military, I thought "ha, that reminds me of Walter from Big Lebowski". Then the scene where she wrecks something out the front of a surburban house... etc. It just felt like a few too many "inspired" aspects.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. The most frustrating thing about it was that all this set-up and context hinted at what *could* have been an amazing film. I hate it when a film takes an interesting concept and just drives it hard into the ground. The second half felt like it was being written as it went, with no real overall point, theme or sense of purpose. The forced climax which I can barely even remember, something about fixing a drive or something, was like something you'd get in one of the more boring episodes of a kids cartoon.  </TEXT>
