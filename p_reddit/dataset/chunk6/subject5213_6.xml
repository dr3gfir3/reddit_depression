	<TITLE> Thanksgiving advice this year </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I've been cooking at home for awhile now, but I've only recently been given the task of cooking holiday feasts for 20+ people.

This Thanksgiving my sister in law is hosting at their house and I'll be coming over that morning and staying all day to prepare the side dishes.  The problem is, she has a smaller kitchen and limited stove/oven space.  I was wanting to maybe cook some things early in the morning at home before I left -- like mashed potatoes and green beans.  My only concern is that I'm not sure how they would hold up after 8+ hours.  Can you safely keep food hot for that long?  And will the texture/flavors be compromised?  Has anyone had success using a slow cooker to keep potatoes warm?  

I was thinking mashed potatoes aren't time consuming to make, it's the peeling and cutting that takes me awhile.  Maybe I could prep them at home, then boil and finish them at SIL's?

I am doing the cranberry sauce and dessert the night before at home and then the dressing and dinner rolls at SIL's house so they don't dry out.  Would appreciate any advice, especially from Thanksgiving vets!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time a girl I started to be friends with found out I was gay, and she got all excited and wanted me to "say funny things". Like there were lines she thought would be funny if I said it in a "gay" way.  I was so confused, I wasn't sure what she wanted.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know I'm late but Hey Arnold! Is a show I enjoyed just as much as an adult.  Watching it gave me a new perspective on Helga who had to deal with a dysfunctional family, from her workaholic dad, to mom who's alcoholism is inferred all throughout the series.  Her mom is always a dazed and depressed, "smoothie" addict.  At one point it's hinted that she's had at least one DUI, when Helga asks her "when did you get your license back?".  And Bob mentions her having to start community service in one episode.  Also, you could sometimes hear the sound of ice from her cup of coffee.  

The whole series deserves a rewatch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol damnit, I wasn't planning on taking a pic until after I plated.  Plus I hate doing dishes, so if I'm already dirtying a sink full of pots and pans I'll use disposable plates.  Costco sells really durable ones that won't bend like cheaper ones.   </TEXT>
