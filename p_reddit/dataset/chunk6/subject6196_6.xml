	<TEXT> Yeah those two (10 and 7) are tough since stray shots go into each-others' fairway. Too many people bring too much club there, when you should be playing them like a double par 3. So you get these crazy slicing drives.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's always when I hit my best drives: when we're eyeing the group in front of us and I say, "Yeah, they're close to 300 out, there's no way I can get to them." Boom, nut the drive and get every bit of it.

There's probably a lesson there about how it's best to swing smooth instead of hard.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Iron Horse golf club in Ft Worth, TX. Par-3 14th hole. My dad blades his shot 50 yards to the right of the hole into the trees. Hits a thick trunk, rainbows into the air, and lands on the green. Barely misses a hole in one and lands 3 feet from the hole. 

Would have been the most ridiculous hole-in-one ever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Screw over people? I think you've got it backwards. 

The baseline scenario is no obstruction. Ideally, there are no obstructions on a golf course, but of course you have to have a rake *somewhere.* Putting the rake toward the fairway is intentionally creating a barrier to negate a percentage of the bunker. "Always replace it where it would help someone (aka keep them out)" is a ridiculous thing to do. You're intentionally altering the conditions of the course.

[Golf Digest](http://www.golfdigest.com/story/does-anyone-know-where-bunker-rakes-should-go) says the following:

 Though theres not a specific rule about where to put rakes, there is a decision that deals with the issue. It explains that **the biggest concern is the rake getting in the way of play**. So, dont leave them inside the bunker along a steep bank, because it could catch someones ball. Dont toss rakes into the middle of bunkers, because youre just a jerk if you do that. **And dont lay them in front of bunkers, because it could stop someones ball from going into the bunker.**

I don't want a piece of equipment affecting my play, even if it helps me. If I go in the bunker, then I go in the bunker and need to fight my way out. That's golf. You're not giving "common courtesy" by intentionally creating an obstruction that changes the course conditions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done that by accident on a Par 5 once. Second shot, was something like 270 out, so I used my hybrid (which I normally hit around 200-220) just to get it close. I hit it smooth and perfectly straight, it takes a cartoonish bounce off a sprinkler head, and rolls all the way through the green and out the back. The guys on the green put their hands in the air like, "WTF?" 

I immediately drove up to the green to apologize to the guys, and thankfully they had a sense of humor about it when they heard what happened. They said it probably would have been an albatross if the flag was in. 

I ended up blading the chip, then three-putting for a 7.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played Stadium Links at the Rangers stadium last November. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/5e431t/stadium_golf_at_the_ballpark_in_arlington_fun_way/) a post I made about it back then. It was a lot of fun, though kind of a gimmick.

Your normal entry fee gets you one ball per hole, but you can pay extra and get two balls. There's no putting; your score is determined by how close to the hole you hit it. On the green is par, within the circle around the hole is a birdie, off the green is a bogey. That sort of thing. The holes were between 110-180 yards, though the distances posted were *way* off compared to what our laser-scope said. So bring one if you have it.

Beyond that, they had chipping and putting skills areas setup for you to play before or after your round, but they cost extra money, and the prizes weren't great. 

Overall it was a fun experience with my brothers and dad, but I wouldn't do it again.  </TEXT>

Again, I'm totally against it and think they're fucktards for it all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, the thing most people don't understand is that the US is [China's largest trade partner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_China). Countries with that much trade just *can't* go to war without crippling their economies.

It's one of the largest benefits of free trade agreements: they make war almost infeasible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right, but TV media and internet media are invariably linked. CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News all have websites that get as much--if not more--viewership than their television coverage, and the article click-rate factors into what gets airtime on TV. 

So avoiding clickbaity articles about bombs does affect the content of television coverage, even if you don't have a Nielsen box.  </TEXT>
