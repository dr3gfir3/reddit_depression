	<TEXT> I thought you guys might get a kick out of this tweet I found: https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/804432339640037376

Basically, the US government is moving towards an anti-science, climate change is a myth ethos. The House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology tweeted a Breitbart link that climate change was a lie. 

Government tweet: ".@BreitbartNews: Global Temperatures Plunge. Icy Silence from Climate Alarmists"

Bernie response: "Where'd you get your PhD? Trump University?"

Bernie has received more than 11,000 retweets so far. Proof that Twitter isn't all marketing. It's also now a public stage for American politics, where news is created (and then retweeted).  </TEXT>

Then do some math: averages for follower growth rate and engagement rate are usually a good place to start. Follower growth rate is really important for defending your KPIs. If your boss wants you to double your followers in a month, you can show that even your top-performing competitor only grows about 20% a month.

	<TEXT> A huge part of marketing is knowing how to use good news like this. 

You need to capture all the people who are seeing this somehow, and the surge to your website. I hope that you've updated your site and all your social media channels with the news that you're featured on google play - celebrate it as a major win with all your followers and your existing customers. Two blog posts on your site and on Medium would be a good idea - one, celebrating the feature, the second, with 'how' you got the feature with a unique twist. Celebrate your long-time customers in a big way: the ones who first downloaded and tried your game. This is their win, too. Customers love to be part of their company's success, and it builds brand loyalty. 

Do you get customers emails when they download your app? It would be awesome to capture them on your site. Play our app? Sign up here for more tips, insights, whatever. Then have a simple sign up form where you get their first name, email, and favourite game of all time etc (with social signup options as well). I assume that you want to build more games in the future - getting info about what your current customers like to build more games would be huge. A mailing list is very valuable, even more so if you have their social handles along with it. 

I'd also suggest doing an AMA in a bigger subreddit. 

Could also be a good time for a PR push. Start by emailing a big list of smaller blogs (customized for each journalist), wait a couple of days and hopefully get a few features, and then reach out to bigger sites. Ask if they want to learn more about how the app was made (your unique, special story) or if they want to be the first to test your next game.

	<TEXT> Paid fan acquisition campaigns aren't my area of expertise. You might ask over at /r/adtech as well.

A targeted like campaign using a third party application might be your best bet. Like the posts of people who use a specific combination of hashtags, or who follow your competitors. There are tools available so you can do likes when someone matches the filters you've set. Instagress is good for this.

I wouldn't recommend a follow/unfollow campaign. Having really high following numbers will undermine your brands' legitimacy.

	<TEXT> Developing a good social media strategy will probably take reading a few books and case studies about best in class brands. It depends on how much time/effort you want to invest.

First, answer these questions to form the basis of your strategy:

Who is your audience? How old? What gender? What interests? What cities? What devices? 

What content does your audience like?

What platforms are your audience on?

Why do they go to those platforms? What are they looking for?

What communities are they involved in, or crowdculture movements? (veganism, pop culture feminism, goth, whatever). What platforms are those communities on? How can you get involved in them/leverage them in an authentic way?

What is your goal for a social media presence? What does "exposure" mean?

What is your brand voice / tone / story?

What do best-in-class DJs do to be successful on social?

Once you've got that sorted, you can develop a content strategy, content themes, and a schedule.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump has tweeted that he doesn't believe in climate change for years, since at least 2012. It's not a new belief that he picked up to appeal to the alt-right and get elected. 

He's elected a climate change denier as head of the EPA, so we have to assume that those beliefs are sincere.

	<TEXT> Hillary was the second most voted for candidate in American history, though. She lost the election overall, but it's not like people didn't come out and vote for her. She won the popular vote by more than 1 million.

All these conversations about how she lost and how no one likes her confuse me for that reason.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before you do a massive follow/unfollow campaign, ask your friends and family to follow the account and try to get to 100 followers. 

Then, focus on your big picture strategy. Making a social media strategy is basically answering a few key questions. Why do you have this account? What do you hope to achieve? Who is your audience? What do they want? What do best in class artists on Instagram do? 

Once you've answered those questions, you should be golden. You can make a content strategy, develop your content themes, create the content itself, and make a schedule. 

After you've started posting, build your community on the communities of others - shout outs to influencers in your space, sincere compliments on their work, linking to their Instagram accounts from your other social pages, etc. This is the best way to get organic followers - join and help build a real community (aka crowdculture marketing).  </TEXT>

Your work is very professional looking. It looks corporate and clean, and it's stuff that clients would pay for. It sounds like you've built a solid foundation of skills. Keep going: really learn how to use Photoshop and Illustrator. Time spent learning them will save you even more whenever you design something (plus save you a lot of frustration). 

Given your age, I'd use your skills to be experimental and try out the bleeding edge trends in the art world. Go wild with your designs and see what you come up with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Background**
Can social media predict the next president? In December of last year, Crowdbabble launched a series of case studies to find out.

Traditional polls are conducted by phone, with samples sizes in the thousands. With user bases in the hundreds of millions, social media networks provide a much broader reading of public opinion  with unpredictable and often inaccurate results. Do Donald Trumps frenzied fans and followers indicate that hell steal the election? Or do they follow and engage only for the candidates entertainment value?

Here are Donald Trump and Hillary Clintons final positions on social media before election day.

**Final Totals**

The aggregate social data Crowdbabble collected for the election is staggering. From January 1 to November 6, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton amassed a total following of 48,986,921 across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. On those three networks, Trump and Clintons posts attracted 495,120,770 engagements. Half a billion likes, comments, shares, retweets, and reactions. And most of them went to Trump.

Graphs and data by social network here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/in-the-final-hours-of-the-election-who-is-winning-on-social-media/

The biggest engagement gap between the candidates is on Twitter, where Trumps stream of consciousness rage is expressed 140 characters at a time. Throughout his campaign Trump has maintained personal control of his Twitter handle, up until this week. **Trump closed his campaign with 12.9 million Twitter followers; Hillary, with 10.2 million.**

Trump tweets to comment on, or even create, many of his campaign scandals. His first-person, forceful tweets fire up his followers.

On Twitter, Trump stayed ahead with **89,459,006 total engagements to Hillarys 41,572,396**.

Which candidate won the election on social media? Trump and Clintons total followings are 24.3% apart. As of November 6, Donald Trump has 27,902,237 fans across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to Hillary Clintons 21,084,684.

Donald Trump is further ahead in total engagement, or the number of times people interacted with or endorsed his content on social. In total, from January 1 to November 6, Trump garnered 351 million engagements on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Hillary Clinton attracted less than half Trumps total: 145 million.

**Predicting the Next President**

Crowdbabble collects data for more than 400 metrics on each social platform. Which ones can help predict election outcomes? Based on engagement rate, we incorrectly predicted that Bernie Sanders would become the Democratic nominee. In a later case study, we found a stronger correlation between share of followers and polling percentages for the two.

Total follower share predicted Hillary Clinton's win in the primaries. For Clinton and Trump, social media audience share and the polls share similar parallels. Both are both split. As of November 6, Hillary has 43% of the total audience across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and will take 50% of the popular vote, according to Monmouth University. But Trump has 47% of total audience share and in the same poll is predicted to win 44% of the popular vote. Trump's stronghold on social media is invisible to Hillary supporters, and vice versa. On Facebook and Instagram, you see more of what you like in your feed  there are no equal time laws on social media.

More than 200 million engagements and 6 million fans and followers ahead, catching up to Donald Trump on social media is impossible.  If the general election follows the same pattern as the primaries, the social media data collected indicates that Donald Trump be the next President. Trump's larger audience share on social media could be an indicator of a potential win, as it was for Hillary in the primaries. Hillarys current position  lower engagement, with an eleventh hour surge  follows Bernies pattern before he lost the nomination. Trump seized the Republican nomination with a similar social media lead and unpromising polling numbers behind him. But the general election hasn't followed the pattern of the primaries to date; counting on parallels between them will lead to inaccurate predictions.

Donald Trump has won the election on social media. Will that win put him in the White House? We'll know for sure in less than 24 hours.

Donald Trump has won the election on social media. Will that win put him in the White House? We'll know for sure in less than 24 hours.

...

Do you guys think social media numbers can help predict election outcomes?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So exciting! Congrats on the new role. 

I'd definitely set up analytics for your company so you can automate tracking and really monitor your performance. Crowdbabble has Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and with its competitive reports you could stack yourself against local competition. You'll also need a scheduling tool, so you don't lose your mind having to post every single day. 

That's the next thing: look at what your competitors are doing. Twitter is usually not a great choice for retail, but Instagram seems like it could help a lot - particularly if you use local hashtags and get involved in local communities. I wouldn't axe Instagram. 

What are your competitors doing? Before you write any posts, you'll need a brand identity and then a content strategy that comes from that. Look at your competitors and your customer demographics before you start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Crowdbabble is working on YouTube analytics now and they won't be ready until spring, so I can't help you there. It does have the other three plus LinkedIn.

If you only want to track that one metric, I might suggest just doing it manually. Seems crazy to pay a monthly fee that includes hundreds of metrics if you just want the one.

Keep in mind that analytics services can only track your follower growth going forward, due to API limits. Once you sign on, they will begin to count your followers going forward. But getting historical info is tough.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Collaborate with local clubs to offer discounts. Work with the on campus green/eco groups and offer a discount for coffee in a thermos - that will bring a lot of students on board right away. You can also try giving an 'exclusive' discount to whatever coffee clubs are on campus. Make agreements with local roasters to carry their beans - you will get discounts if you buy in bulk. Plus street cred with people who know their coffee. You might also consider a special discount for a particular tier - like faculty, or seniors. 

From there, Instagram and the right hashtags should help you attract students. I'm not sure if a Facebook Page or a Twitter profile will be worth it for you. If someone Instagrams their coffee and shares it with you, they should get something free. Like an extra punch in a loyalty card. 

In terms of the cart construction, definitely don't just wing it. Follow health department codes to the letter and look at how other carts are built.  </TEXT>
