	<TEXT> I looked around for some more info since this hasn't really ever crossed my mind. The one exception appears to be Meizu, since they have launched some phones with Exynos processors. However, it may not have been a big deal to Qualcomm considering Meizu's main market is China and apparently [90% of their devices](https://gearburn.com/2017/03/meizu-qualcomm-phones/) utilize MediaTek. 

Moving forward, it'll be interesting to see how Exynos plays a role in Meizu's lineup since in late December it was [announced that Meizu agreed to pay Qualcomm licensing fees](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-30/qualcomm-to-gain-fees-from-china-s-meizu-in-lawsuit-settlement-ixbd1ikq) and because the first article I linked to mentioned the following:

 However, it cites sources from the upstream supply chain as saying that Snapdragon chips will account for 30% of all Meizu smartphone shipments in 2017 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm enjoying it, though I still prefer Android. In regards to other flagships, the main thing I like about the iPhone is the consistent battery life. Unlike with some other phones, I've never had a day where the battery life unexpectedly took a dive. The camera is great, but the same can be said for many of the flagships from 2016. In comparison to other dual camera phones, I slightly prefer the wide angle lens incorporated into the V20 rather than the telephoto lens in the 7 Plus. Moving onto the screen, I prefer Samsung's amoled panels, but the iPhone's display is still great to look at. I'm not a pixel peeper so having it be a FHD panel rather than a QHD doesn't bother me. 

I'll stop there because this could get longer if I keep on going. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. 

Just to add: I never owned the Pixel/Pixel XL, but out of the 2016 flagships I've had, my favorite still has to be the Note 7. </TEXT>

#Potential good news: 
On the back of the box it states A3LSMG955U. As reported by [Droid Life](http://www.droid-life.com/2017/03/08/unlocked-galaxy-s8-plus-s8-fcc-smg950-smg955/), this is the unlocked U.S. version. If this is being sold with a Verizon box, it could mean the U.S. could just see one model instead of the typical carrier variants.

With the first setting, you just drag your finger around to manipulate the shape of the face. The movements are pretty limited, but the result is evident in the second photo. The next three settings are just sliders that you adjust to your liking. I went to the extreme with all three just to show it in action. I'm not proud of the end result :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  **Immersive full screen for PWAs**

When Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are launched from the Android Home screen, they launch in a standalone app-like mode that hides the omnibox. This helps create an engaging user experience, and frees up screen space for content. However, for even more immersive experiences like games, video players, or other rich content, other mobile UI elements such as the system bars can still be a distraction.
 Now PWAs can provide a fully immersive experience by setting display: fullscreen in their web app manifest, which hides non-app UI when the site is launched from the home screen.

	<TEXT> Seeing as how Samsung marketed the S7 Edge more last year, I guess it's something that warranted an article. 

Sammobile also stated the following:

 Last year, the company focused more on the Galaxy S7 edge, thanks to its larger and curved display. However, the companys strategy might be different this time around. </TEXT>

Reading more, it definitely seems like they created it to make the phone easier to use for some people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It pretty much comes down to how much you value your privacy. Some want to be as secure as possible and prefer not to be tracked online for certain reasons. For them, it doesn't matter if they're simply browsing, torrenting, or doing confidential stuff. Others, like yourself, prefer the convenience VPNs offer by being able to access certain sites blocked by some countries. In that situation, you're not really concerned about privacy.

However, keep in mind that the following is mentioned in the article:

 But a shady or poorly configured service could compromise your traffic, either by design or by accident, or could even piggyback on your encrypted connection for nefarious purposes.

 "Your data could be intercepted or decrypted," said Mat Gangwer, chief technology officer with Rook Security in Indianapolis. "Bad guys could be using your connection for shady activities or to cover their tracks."

You may not be doing confidential things, like online banking, but a compromised VPN could still have a negative impact. It won't always happen, but the possibility is there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What happened here sounds bizarre, but it's actually all of the individual pieces of this charging system working as designed. The battery backup charged my phone until it was drained, and then started pulling power back from the phone because it was drained. USB-C is designed to allow simple power sharing, so anything can charge anything else. In theory it's amazing, and has seriously come in handy when I needed 20 more minutes of juice on my Chromebook for work and only had a phone nearby. In this situation, though, it didn't work out the way I wanted it to.

This has never crossed my mind since I rarely let my battery packs fall below 50%. I'd definitely be upset if I woke up to something like this. </TEXT>

In the initial search UI, in the "similar apps" and "you might like" area beneath each full listing, in developers' individual pages, and in more specialized area, the elements that used to "float" over a background on the Z axis with specific boxes are now all on the same plane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, and I wouldn't be surprised if the mods remove it for that reason, but it still has the ability to benefit mobile users as mentioned below (emphasis mine):

 It is our hope that webmasters and graphic designers will find Guetzli useful and apply it to their photographic content, making users experience smoother on image-heavy websites **in addition to reducing load times and bandwidth costs for mobile users.** Last, we hope that the new explicitly psychovisual approach in Guetzli will inspire further image and video compression research.

Ultimately, there could be benefits to Android in the form of incorporating the feature into the OS as it gets further developed. In addition to the above-mentioned benefits, it could reduce the size of pictures and videos taken by our phones without negatively impacting quality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This is no more the regulation of the internet than the First Amendment is the regulation of free speech, Wheeler told WIRED in an exclusive interview.

 Its not a perfect analogythe order applies to the private sector, while the First Amendment enjoins government censorship. But the comparison is still apt. **Just as the First Amendment guarantees a set of rights for US citizens, the Open Internet Order outlines a set of rights for internet users.**

	<TEXT> The following is stated in the Family Link FAQ:

 When your kid turns 13, they have the option to graduate to a normal Google Account. Before a kid turns 13, parents will get an email letting them know their kid will be eligible to take charge of their account on their birthday, so you can no longer manage their account. On the day they turn 13, kids can choose whether they want to manage their own Google Account or continue to have their parent manage it for them.

If they choose to stay after 13, it seems like the same parental controls are carried over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always end up preferring a wired charging connection, but there are those that state it's a must have feature for them due to the convenience of just placing the phone down and having it instantly begin to charge. Seeing as how LG is only bringing wireless charging to the U.S. G6, it must be a much more popular selling point here than in other markets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Samsung's case, I believe they went the glass route starting with the S6 for wireless charging compatibility. Wireless charging through a metal back isn't yet a thing, even though [Qualcomm announced such a thing back in 2015](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2015/07/28/qualcomm-becomes-first-company-enable-wireless-charging-mobile-devices). However, nobody has used that tech yet. LG recently introduced wireless charging for the US version of the G6. Glass is also the main material there.  </TEXT>

 According to this quick pic of some Verizon internal materials, pre-orders start Friday, March 17 for the LG G6. It appears that everyone who pre-orders gets the free Google Home LG is offering, while folks upgrading on an existing plan will also get a $200 trade-in for select devices. If you're coming to Verizon as a new customer (or opening a new line) they have a sweet 43-inch LG TV for you, too. These promos also stack with Verizon's $650 Switcher offer if you're coming from another carrier and the FIOS $500 bundle promo for new customers. </TEXT>
