	<TEXT> You get why he overreacted to a 7 year old child littering? A 7 year old child who was subsequently CHOKED by a grown man for littering?! 

People like you are absolutely terrifying. You see children as adults if they're male and of color. You think brute force is okay for things like LITTERING, as long as the person is of color. And in Trump's America, you all feel free to espouse your hate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> La La Land is terribly overrated. It's not at all a bad film, but I do not understand how it has been deemed worthy of the best film nomination. I mean, look at the rest of the films on the list! La La Land is shallow and garish by comparison! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a troll. The only thing that has changed since I posted my other posts is I've gotten off of Benzodiazepines once again. I was secretly addicted to them, for the second time, for the last year. And I've just emerged from a month long withdrawal. About 5 days into withdrawal, I started feeling like 'what the FUCK am I doing here?!' I started feeling actual feelings again and I stopped believing in whatever bullshit I somehow found myself espousing before. I can't explain it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have tried convincing him that we should leave Saudi, go back to the states (where I'm from) or the U.K. (Where he's from) but he says he doesn't want to be in the west. For him, The KSA is an amazing place. He loves it. And he loves Islam. I love him very much, but I don't love religion and I don't love living in a theocracy.  </TEXT>
