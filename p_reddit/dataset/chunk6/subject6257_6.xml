	<TITLE> Questions about season 2 and other stuff </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Is season 2 coming out soon? Or do they still need to announce it?

Other stuff:
1: Does bell get to know that he has that fast growth skill later on? 
2: When you get to a certain level can you become a god/godess (like if bell reached the ultimate level(highest level possible?) - bell possibly becoming a god??
3: The knife gets stronger while bell also does right? Wouldn't it be epic if the knife becomes a sword after a certain power/level, like if someone else touches it the power goes away and it becomes a knife again. Like only bell can make it a sword again, they said in the anime if anyone else other than bell uses the knife it becomes a useless knife right? That's how i came up with the sword theory huehue ^_^
4: (question for light novel readers) is it further explained how the knife exactly works with bell? Like a better explanation than the anime? (I mean exactly how it works, maybe after the anime in a new volume they explained how it works, additionall information about the knife (Hestia knife)
5: does bell get stronger than everyone later on in the LN
Last question 6: which volume does the anime end at in the Light Novel?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i know i know. I just wanted to know is there a difference, because it's downscaled (right?) so the quality would almost the same lol but people are sayin just use 1080 so i'll do. (I got no worries about connection, i got 50 down, 5 up stable in my house) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the default setting is 720p for the video settings on kissanime, been using that for a long time. BUT I NEVER EVER thought about make it 1080p standard..is 1080p worth it doe? (I'm using a iphone 6s) but can you see a significantly big of a difference or is it downscaled or whatever? Should i use 1080p or is it a waste of battery consumption? People say you almost cant see a difference in animes with 720/1080p...?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it's getting really annoying to use tbh, some fucking chapters have like 7-8 pages with the "tap to reload" bug/error. I tried using Mangahere, the source mangahere doesn't have that "Tap to reload" problem, but there is one big problem with mangahere doe...it takes 1-3 minutes to load a chapter, like the source has a problem, i don't have any internet issues (stable 50 down, 5 up) the other sources load chapters in an instant but mangahere doesn't....oh well, the app makers should update the app or find a fix for this...ffs lol. </TEXT>
