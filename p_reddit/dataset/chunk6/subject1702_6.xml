	<TEXT> Bill O'Reilly laughs at 'bizarre' United Airlines incident where a passenger was dragged off of a flight

*ox News host Bill O'Reilly took to his show on Monday to weigh in on an incident involving a passenger that has rocked United Airlines.*

*After playing the clip of a male passenger being forcibly removed by aviation police officers Sunday from United flight 3411, O'Reilly chuckled as he said to Fox News correspondent Rob Schmitt, "I shouldn't be laughing, but it's just so bizarre."*

*"They had to get some United Airlines personnel from Chicago to Louisville ... they had to get them there and so they asked for volunteers, and obviously, this guy didn't volunteer," continued O'Reilly as he laughed.*

*Toward the end of the segment, O'Reilly seemed to take a more serious tone. "Can't have this kind of stuff, it looks like a police state," he said.*

"Judge Kristine Baker, who was appointed to U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by President Barack Obama, ruled in 2014 that Arkansas' gay marriage ban was unconstitutional. A year later, she blocked an Arkansas law that would have restricted the use of abortion pills."

"Arkansas, which hasn't executed anyone since 2005, is preparing to execute seven inmates before its supply of midazolam expires at the end of the month. Baker is considering the legality of that plan this week."

**Baker must rule whether the state's plan to execute seven prisoners from April 17 through April 27 would violate their rights to meaningful counsel and access to the courts.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Neil Gorsuchs confirmation to the Supreme Court was made possible in part by the Judicial Crisis Network, which spent $17 million lobbying to keep Merrick Garland off the benchand to get Gorsuch on it. Where did all that money come from? We dont know, because it was almost entirely dark money, funneled through a Koch-allied conduit that keeps its donors secret. But the JCN isnt entirely anonymous: It has a public face in Carrie Severino, the groups chief counsel and policy director. Severino essentially served as Gorsuchs lobbyist, throwing money around to ensure his confirmation. Like many lobbyists, she enjoys the access to power that her job affords her. Indeed, Severino attended Gorsuchs swearing-in ceremony at the White House Rose Garden on Monday morning.* </TEXT>

micah: So is it helpful for Democrats to look for a scapegoat? Or, more generously, to spend a lot of time sifting through the causes of Clintons loss?

clare.malone: Causes of loss, of course.

Let us state for the record here  history has proved that scapegoating feels good in the short term, but will screw you up in the long term.

**and** you are naive if you think Jill Stein would/should/could get no votes or that people that voted for her woulda/shoulda/coulda have all voted for Hillary. Duh, more people should have voted Hillary, period, duh.

The number of people who did not vote is way more important than blaming **Fuck Gorsuch** on third parties. And we aren't talking election, we talking **Fuck Gorsuch** </TEXT>

Republicans birthed and molded this ideological conservative court, and lied and conned their way to **Justice Fuck Gorsuch**. Jill Stein or whoever will get more votes next time so it ain't about those votes. 

And, Yes Senators matter; fuck Gorsuch, fuck Republicans, fuck conservatism. . </TEXT>

"Though the state provides funding for such projects at secular institutions, it denied Trinity Lutheran a grant because it is a religious entity."

"During a conference Thursday, the justices will decide whether to hear a religious liberty challenge involving a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, as well as a case concerning the right of gun-owners to carry firearms outside the home....a Second Amendment controversy arising from California, would be the biggest gun-rights decision in several years...**Should the justices take the case and side with the activists, they could announce a constitutionally-protected right to bear firearms outside the home for the first time in American history.**" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor and legal correspondent for Slate, talks with Rachel Maddow about the future of Supreme Court nominations now that Republicans have set a precedent of blocking a nominee because of the nominating president's party. Duration: 6:41*


**Dahlia Lithwick:** "I think this happens now forever, I mean, I think something fundamental broke...and what we learned, and we learned when Mitch McConnell said that *obstructing Merrick Garland was one of his proudest moments of his career*, that this is about power now, it's not about putting up a "mainstream" or "centrist Judge" that Senate can agree on, and it's not about senate norms that say Supreme Court Justices are different, now it's just about power, it's about winning elections, it's about putting the most extreme person you can put up, knowing you just need 51 votes to confirm them, I don't see this unrolling."



**Dahlia:** "The center of the court is now Anthony Kennedy, one of the most conservative jurists in Supreme Court history."


**Rachel:** "Do you subscribe to the commen view now, that he, Judge Gorsuch, will be to the right of every Justice on the court?"


**Dahlia:** "Whether he's to the right of Alito or Thomas, I think those are the questions we're asking, I think he is pretty consistently(*moves hand to far right*) where Scalia, Thomas, Alito are, he is certainly not to the left of any of them." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This video better addresses yesterday's tweet story:

**Trump administration told Russia about its war plans before they told the U.S. Congress.**


I did not care for language of that tweet yesterday and replied thus(and a reply to my reply):

*Again fun tweet but more important questions are:*

*Why did Trump not ask Congress before strike?*

*Did Trump contact Putin or did U.S. contact Russia with a broader agreement about attack opposed to just a warning to avoid casualties?*


*Did they give a fair warning to the people that were killed? And who was killed?*

*Did the ground troops and base deserve a fair warning?*

/u/DiscoConspiracy:

*And was the strike effective? Did it accomplish a goal beyond just destroying/damaging the airfield, and is the effectiveness of that goal being followed up*


I believe this 15 minute video appropriately covers the point of the tweet and the additional questions needed to be asked.

So I responded with an additional point that what he was describing was Fox News. And I directly responded simply by saying this video is not making conclusions like Fox News or other unqualified reports, it is questioning like honest journalist do. And you are continuing like Sneezel to bring in nonsense, and you are not engaging in my defense that this is titled **Wag the Dog?** not **Wag the dog** no question mark.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "**The Ryan bill took a diabolical new tack, going after insurers instead of clinics or providers.** Under the now-dead plan, women enrolled in any insurance plan that covers abortion would not have been eligible for the federal tax credits designed to shave premium costs. A final version did make an exception in cases of rape or incest, or if the abortion is needed to save the womans life. But if enacted, the measure would have effectively eliminated private insurance coverage of abortion, further limiting the procedure to women wealthy enough to pay for it out of pocket."



"With that approach dead for now, and since Trump seems to have ruled out prosecuting women, physicians could well be the target of anti-abortion lawmakers."


"Criminalizing the procedure will saddle individual doctors, whether in private practice or prestigious university teaching hospitals, with a miserable dilemma  serve their frantic patients or risk their professional livelihood. Violating the law would be hard under any circumstances; for younger doctors still paying off steep medical school loans, the financial consequences could be ruinous."

"Older doctors, particularly those who trained in the pre-Roe years, say they still shudder recalling women who were mutilated or died following back-alley or self-induced abortions, and they are determined to continue providing care. As these older practitioners retire, younger ob-gyns have taken up the challenge of training new abortion providers." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well he is insanely compulsive no matter how calculated he may be. Hummmmm...it's like, the at least doesn't flow, I guess if the collusion was more Trump using Putin and Putin using Trump rather than a team player effort and now he's screwing over Putin. If it is a distraction it just leads me to a larger conspiracy which is too conspiratorial for me, but the Susan Rice insanity is so wild and fake particularly post-campaign, it's hard to believe anything isn't a set-up </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ezra Klein,Vox Editor in Chief:

"The problem with Neil Gorsuchs nomination for the Supreme Court is not Neil Gorsuch. He is, by all accounts, a brilliant jurist and a kind man. But he is an extremely conservative judge at a moment when an extremely conservative judge makes a mockery of the popular will. For the good of the country and the Court, this moment demands a compromise nominee, and Gorsuch is not that." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The National Rifle Association ran campaign-style ads in the past week questioning Donnelly's pro-gun stance if he wasn't willing to support Gorsuch, which he did on Thursday, joining three other Democrats who voted to end his party's filibuster. Two Republican U.S. House members, Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, have signaled they may challenge Donnelly for his seat next year." </TEXT>
