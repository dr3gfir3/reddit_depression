	<TEXT> Can you cite a source on this? What I found in the link posted by u/zbucklyo was this:

 A landlord may use the SHST only if the **total amount paid during the year** for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar expenses for a building does not exceed the lesser of $10,000 or 2% of the unadjusted basis of the building.

Looks like it's cumulative. Unless I'm misunderstanding it. Which is very possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get the Caesar Salad most days of the week. For about $5, it's a pretty big salad with a decent amount of toppings. I skip the croutons because it makes me feel like im being healthy.

Sometimes I'll get the pizza. It's good if you eat it fresh. If I have 
to take it to-go it gets gross.

[The Lucky Peach](http://luckypeach.com/guides/the-official-costco-food-court-power-rankings/) did an awesome guide for the food court offerings at Costco. I think it's rather accurate.

I looked up the Safe Harbor rule and I would qualify but I think I've spent too much(by about the cost of the water heater). But this is good to know. If I keep improvements below a certain threshold I can deduct it all. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do I use StubHub tickets? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'll be going to yankee stadium for the first time this year on the 1st. I bought 3 tickets on stubhub so they won't be available until 48 hours before the game. My plan is to bring my phone with the stubhub app but how do I use the other 2 tickets? Do I just pass my phone back through the gate? I'm sure someone has done this...

EDIT: Has anyone used a stubhub ticket THIS YEAR? The rules changed this season. As I understand it, no paper tickets are accepted. I wouldn't think stubhub would allow selling of digital tickets that couldn't be used. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Minor improvements and maintenance on a Live-in Rental Property </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-19 03:12:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello r/Tax!
I tried using the IRS site to help me clear this up but I'm hoping someone can provide a straightforward answer.
I currently live in a house that I rent the basement out to two tenants. 
This past year I've had the following expenses that I'm not sure if the count as "expenses" or if they "add value":

* Replacement Water Heater due to old one exploding(no damage) - $3200
* Put in a new driveway(not replaced, brand new), included replacing front concrete steps that were falling apart - $4900
* Roof exhaust vent/fan - $500
* Awning over back door/private entrance for tenants - $700
* Landscaping for both aesthetics and to help with drainage - $700
* Installation of storm door - $400

Some of these things could be seen as purely maintenance, some might add value to the house. But no single expense was over $5000. Can I expense it all? Do I need to depreciate the driveway or water heater?
While my tenants rent the basement, the whole house(kitchen, living room, laundry room) is shared. I'd say about a 3rd of the house is truly "mine" (my bedroom and my office). 
I also pay all utils(about $300/month) and $30 every other week for lawn care.
I have a full time job and I withhold the maximum amount so I've never owed money but obviously I'd like to expense as much as possible. This year I'll have brought in about $10,000 in rent. 

Little help? If I broke the rules, I'm sorry. I read them and think I'm in the clear?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was applying for grad school and there was a mix up at the admissions office. I had to call in to set up an appointment to come in(had to be done in person) and prove that I was in-state. I was already pissed, i had lived in the same state all my life and went(and graduated from a year prior) to the same school as an undergrad.

I called and left a message but the voicemail was hard to understand so I wasn't sure if I had left a message for the right person. I ended the message with something like, "oh and by the way I really hope this is *Ms. Whomever fixes this fuck-up* because I couldn't understand the voicemail. If you're going to have a voicemail you should make it clear who it is otherwise there could be mistakes made."
I got a call back telling me the time/date of my appointment and that the woman I was making an appointment with has a speech impediment.
Boy, did I feel bad when I showed up for that appointment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went in for a cutco interview once. It was weird that there were 20 or so people in this room when I got there. But hey, i needed a job. I thought they'd call us into the back for interviews, but then did a "group interview" which again, set off alarms. It was a presentation about the cutco product and company. I started asking questions and stopped taking notes on everything the presenter said. At various times throughout the interview she would ask people to leave or go into the office for an interview. It seemed like they tried making a competition out of it. If you were paying attention and taking notes, you got to go for an office interview. If you stop taking notes you're labeled as "not cutco material" and are asked to leave. The first few people who got kicked out were pretty dim. Asked really stupid questions. Then I asked about the commission and some other details. She looked at me dead in the eye and said, "I don't think you're cutco material. Please collect your things and leave." and I responded, in a stern and rather loud tone, "Thank you."   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember freshman year all the frats would invite us out for Rush events. Free food and booze. And sometimes they'd go all out. Shrimp, crab, imported beer, etc. Each time, after about 20 min of chilling and eating they'd launch into their pitch for the frat. We'd nod and then leave, on to the next Rush event. It felt like they wanted us to join a cult but we felt like we outsmarted them.

Somehow I felt this story was relevant to yours... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in Atlantic City about 10 years ago standing in line to cash in my $300 worth of chips after playing poker. I was with my family and they had been blowing up my phone about meeting them for dinner and I could tell they were pissed. The line for the cage was super long. Some guy came up to me in line and offered to buy my chips because he wanted to jump on a table. He handed me some bills, a couple of 50s and such. I hand him my rack of chips, he disappears in the crowd, and I head towards the buffet. As I'm walking I start to count the money. It's only $120. I start freaking out. I run back to the poker room and try to find the guy but asking for a short asian guy in a sea of people just gets you dirty looks.

I felt quite the fool. And I'll never not change out at the cage again. It could have been counterfeit for all I knew.

Also once I got kicked out of a group Cutco "interview" for asking too many questions. So I'm not all stupid. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Locking in a rate for Natural Gas </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Frugal!
I recently got an offer from my gas company to have my rate locked in for the next year at 0.495 per Therm. The letter states that prices fluctuate throughout the year and this would protect me if prices went up. I've looked through my old bills for the past year and it looks like I never paid more that 0.479 per Therm on any given month. I'm inclined to decline but would love to hear some opinions on this.

Thanks, </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, since yo offered...

Roller Coasters/rides would be a priority. Food/drink is up there. I don't think anyone in this group cares to go to the princess tea party. I've suggested we do a day in Hollywood for the rides and a day in Epcot for the food/experience. Haven't heard back but I think it's a good start. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bachelor Party in Disney World </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Looking for any and all advice on planning a bachelor party for 5-10 people in Orlando for a long weekend. We're looking to have a good time on a budget($300ish/person not including airfare) and not do the standard "bachelor party" experience(we like our jiggling done on a roller coaster). I assumed staying in the park would be the most bang for the buck but I'm curious what others think. Should we do an Air BnB just outside the park? Should we focus on a specific park? Are there packages we should look out for? I'm hoping we can go mid to late january, hopefully it's not too late. I'm also hoping this isn't the first time anyone has done this. Someone must have planned a bachelor/bachelorette part at Disney at some point. Tips and tricks welcome!


Edit: $300/person sorry i wasn't clear. And I'm gonna bump it up to $500 cause estimating can be hard sometimes.

Thanks!

	<TEXT> This is great!
We haven't decided if we'll try out Universal. 
I assume we'll want to do more roller coaster stuff so we'll probably stick to the ark formerly known as MGM and Epcot.

Would it be smart to call Disney and see if they have suggestions? I always heard they rock at planning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a)don't throw them in the toilet. Even the "flushable" ones will clog plumbing. I keep a plastic grocery bag to throw them in.

b)don't use them often. I try to keep it down to once a week on a fear of developing a rash. Through anecdotal evidence (3 or 4 friends) using them regularly will cause a rash even if you use the ones that say they won't.

Good Luck! </TEXT>
