	<TEXT> Me and my friends wanted to go to waterpark in Prnu which is 100km away from my hometown. Told my mom I was going to a friends house as the lie. So we got there, everything was fun and good until I went for the last jump from the tower, 3m from the pool. One dude was before me, he jumped and i waited for him to swim towards the ladder and i jumped. But for some reason he swam back to the landing point and I fell almost on top of him. My right hand hit his shoulders. Huge pain was felt. Went to emergency, 2 finger bones broken and my hand was put in a cast. Went home with it, mom was angry as fuck that I lied, cant go out anymore. Im 14. </TEXT>

Here I am right now, 14 and loving the other Reggae aswell. I am still a big fan of Marley, but I dislike his ,,wannabe-fans'' 'cause they think that every Reggae piece is by Bob Marley. Some examples: Sweat (Inner Circle), Red Red Wine (UB40), Legalize It (Peter Tosh). They don't even have Bob's voice, yet people think ye it's reggae, so it must be done by Bob Marley, cause he is the most famous one, right? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIFU by not knowing that yellow raspberries exist my whole life </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So let's start off by saying that I love raspberries. They are my favorite berry by far. At home my mom grows like 3 bushes of them, aunt grows like 30, grandma grows like 30 aswell and uncle grows like 500 (uncle sells them for living along with other things he gets from his garden).  
Well, I am at my aunt's place right now and she needed some help outside for carrying 2 poles to another location, got my gloves and went to help her. We get the pole and walk to the destination and there are tons of raspberries at the buses we walked by. I said that ,,holy shit, so many perfectly red raspberries", she said that that is true. We get the pole on the ground and go back for another one. Suddenly she says that look how many yellow ones are ready aswell. I was like wtf there are yellow raspberries growing? She said ye ofcourse, feel free to take them, they are as sweet as the normal red ones. I was mindblowed. YELLOW RASPBERRIES?!?!?! I ate them and they were delicious. Sad thing that I realised after that they have been growing there for 14 years and I thought that they are raw since raw raspberries are kinda greenish yellowish.  
TL;DR: didnt know yellow raspberries exist for 14 years, turned out they do and they are delicious </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I threw a bucket of water with sheep shit in the water at my friend, the dude starded chasing me with a bat and I ended up running thorugh a glass door because of the frightment. 5 wounds, longest wound was like 7cm, and the other time is that i threw my buddy with a bottle and he didnt do anything. After that I went to the kitchen to get some food and I come back to the room and it's empty. Thought that maybe he went to take a shit and went to drop down to my bed when suddenly a hand grabs my foot. He was  under my fucking bed trying to scare me and I hit my head so hard against a corner that I had to get 2 stitches on the head. 2 fucking AM. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once throw a bottle at my roommates face. He was a bit mad but i didn't expect anything. Anyway, later I went to the kitchen to bring some food and I went to the room and it was empty at my first sight. I went to kinda fall in my bed when suddenly a fucking hand grabs my legs and laughing is heard. He was under the fucking bed, waiting for me to scare me. But instead of just jump-scaring me, because of him I hit my head against the corner quite hard and it made a nice normal sized wound. I ended up getting 4 stitches there. It happened at 2AM.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love it! It is a relaxing piece of music that from time to time has a message in it aswell ;)  
I was like 11 when I first started to love Reggae and now  I absolutely love it, prefer it to every other genre of music.  Mm.. it's instead of albums I would just give you some reggae songs that I started to love reggae through. Gotta be honest, nowadays, reggae isn't that good that it was in the Bob Marley, Inner Circle and UB40. Yet, there are some artists that do some good stuff, but for a disliker of reggae I would recommend:  
[Bob Marley - Stir It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3UqvWk8-uw)  
[Bob Marley - Three Little Birds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LanCLS_hIo4)  
[UB40 - Rde Red Wine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXt56MB-3vc)  
[Bob Marley - Kaya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JUm_Y0R6Og)  
These were the first few reggae songs I heared and from there on I listened more and I started to like it. Lots of B.Marley, cause to be honest, he is the best reggae artist of all time. I'm actually quite lucky though, that in Estonia, this nation that consists of 1.3 people, have an awesome reggae band called Bombillaz. You can check them out if you want to, but you won't understand anything unless you are an estonian, what makes it ever harder to understand them is that they use lots of estonian slang and speak quite fast.  
But yeah, I hope that my little-little comment here helps you a bit surviving to listening to reggae ;)  
EDIT: Feel free to listen to Bob Marley's children music. Ziggy has some great vibes aswell!  </TEXT>
