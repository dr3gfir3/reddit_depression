	<TEXT> Yes but here's a secret... you can dust it out. Not only that, you can monitor the temperature of your components and have email alerts so you know when to dust it out! My servers recently alerted me of such.

I'm not the one that talked about solder "breaking down", collinsl02 did.

As for the cyclic heating, that's a possibility, but I've seen no tangible evidence of this actually happening to CPUs. Since they are the typically the highest heat generating part in a computer, the other parts in such a regard are irrelevant. When I say no evidence, I mean I've seen no studies or reports about it, and I've not seen it happen in servers that have been running for decades. There are literally servers that have been running for upwards of 30+ years, so if this were ACTUALLY a thing, it would have happened by now and been readily visible. But it doesn't, and it isn't.

Not dusting out a computer, well that's just stupid and of course will lead to failure, but that's regular maintenance and very easy to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dust! Oh no! What ever shall we do! The parts that actually heat up enough aren't even close to solder, and even still the melting point of solder lead is 188oc which CPUs either shut down before they reach that, or thermal-throttle themselves, which starts about 100oc.

Face it dude, you're wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's just a perception from various things around us being faster, but the hardware isn't actually any slower at all. In fact if you properly re-purpose hardware they can still be very competitive with modern hardware! depending on the workload of course. BIOS' init faster, HDDs run faster, but silicon doesn't actually slow down. If you're running lots of lightweight tasks, like email servers, websites, or other things, such hardware can last way longer than most realise.

I still have harder that still works after well over 10 years of use! Just need to build appropriately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

BTN is ratioless, and clearly very successful. So when we see new trackers like RED/PTH, etc, turn up with ratios, it kind of blows my mind that we're still using an antiquated method like that.

Ratios generally require a zero-sum reality, and life just isn't like that. Not only that ratio trackers make the users feel less interested in trying new things because of the "cost" of such things, and then they need to do a return-on-investment consideration. "If I download this, will I ever get ratio back for it?". Chances are, if it's a low popularity item, you will never get ratio back for it.

This all seems very counter-productive to the whole sharing culture we've built for ourselves here.

I think ratioless is the way to go. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If that person on that computer searched for a topic along the lines of how to throw, the websites that come up, and the google searches, could use several different mechanisms to identify that computer and browser.

1. A cookie/cookies could be delivered to the computer as a fingerprint.
2. The session of the browser/ip/resolution/other identifiers can be uniquely generated to identify. The extent this method can go is very deep.

Next, once identification has been assessed, this can cross multiple sites if the same advertising agents that generate the identifying marks, are the same ones presenting the ads on other sites. So when they go to youtube (OH SHIT GOOGLE OWNS THAT TOO), it's possible for the ads to pick up on the above identifiers and deliver ads relevant to their past behavior. In this case, related to the search for "throwing".

This is used all over the internet and has been for years now, it's a modern technique to try to improve the quality of ads people see so they are more likely to interact with them. This is just a comical side effect.

Also, these mechanisms are a particular concern for people who care about their privacy. Long-term data can be collected in such ways to develop profiles of people and sometimes this can become invasive and overreaching. Hence why browsers have things like "incognito" mode, which helps quite a bit, but not completely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're talking about having one VM technically operate across more than 1 bare-metal computer at the same time, you're talking more along the lines of an application/beowulf cluster. This is technically possible, but most hypervisors don't do this. While I can't direct you in how to do this, I know it has been achievable for over a decade. I'm not sure what software does it, but you're probably in for some very complicated elements.

Perhaps consider, is there anything you want to do that actually would benefit from such a structure? If yes, then look into it. If no, then consider it might not be worth the effort. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

We're looking to get some help with developing our website, and possibly future tools for our events.

To be clear, this is a volunteer position. We understand this isn't for everyone, and that's fine. But if you're interested in contributing, working with us can grant some great experience, and help develop the future of gaming in our part of the world.

You wouldn't be alone, we already have staff contributing to such work, but we are working to increase the number of contributors so that we can roll out awesome stuff faster, without overloading people.

Are you possibly interested? We're looking for 1 to 2 individuals who are familiar with the LAMP stack. Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL, PHP. Also, we're hoping to get help with both the front-end and back-end development.

If you're interested, don't be intimidated, apply today! If you have a resume, send that to us. If not, just tell us what experience you do have, what things you've worked on/with, and just do your best to "sell" yourself on how you can help us. Competitive experience is nice too, so if you have any of that, do let us know! (even if it's not-gaming related). Also, if you have any programming experience, whatever the language, please include that too. Again, there's plenty of room for learning here, and we recognise that there are transferable skills too!

To apply, please email bloodyiron _at lanified dot_ com </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Using POL to install battle.net, then for WoW: Legion, 64-bit </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-17 05:15:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I'm trying to get World of Warcraft: Legion to work in a 64-bit version of WINE, and so far it's working rather well. Considering there are people who get tripped up getting battle.net setup, I figured I would share what I had to do to get battle.net alone going in such an environment. This is using the Play On Linux tool version 4.2.10

1. Install Wine 2.0-rc6-staging 64-bit (2.0-staging and/or 2.1-staging probably works fine too, but the one I know works is 2.0-rc6-staging)
2. Turn CSMT on
3. In the libraries section of the WINE configuration, set the following values (copy exactly between the quotes, including asterisks):

* "*winhttp" native/builtin
* "*wininet" native/builtin
* "api-ms-win-crt-conio-l1-1-0" native
* "api-ms-win-crt-heap-l1-1-0" native
* "api-ms-win-crt-locale-l1-1-0" native
* "api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0" native/builtin
* "api-ms-win-crt-stdio-l1-1-0" native/builtin
* "d3d11" disabled
* "msvcp140" native/builtin
* "ucrtbase" native
* "vcruntime140" native/builtin
4. Add the following components:
* Microsoft Core Fonts
* vcrun2010
* vcrun2012
* d3dx9
* winhttp

5. Install winetricks in your parent Linux install (as in, not within POL), and use it to install vcrun2015. You will need to point winetricks to the prefix that POL created for this. To find the exact commands, check out : https://www.playonlinux.com/en/issue-5291.html . This will also install a bunch of other stuff along with it, which I didn't find to be a problem.
6. INSTALL Battle.net and run.

I had to re-install it for some reason at some point (crashed over night), however I didn't have to modify this prefix otherwise. Battle.net is launching for me, I installed WoW:Legion successfully with it, and I was able to launch WoW:Legion through the client too.

**IMPORTANT, DISABLE SOUND NOTIFICATIONS FOR FRIEND MESSAGES WITHIN THE CLIENT. IF YOU DON'T BATTLE.NET WILL CRASH WHEN YOU RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM A FRIEND EACH TIME**

Hope this helps! :D

Specs:

* Ubuntu 16.10 64-bit
* Intel i7-980x
* nVidia GTX 960, driver 367.57
* 3x monitors
* Ur mom lololol

p.s. I fucking hate markdown </TEXT>

Then I should get my ass in gear and make more maps. I've gone from 11 stars to 32, and with any luck maybe I can hit 50 and unlock 10 more sweet upload slots and really do some cool stuff! Thanks for all this dude, and hope we can keep this going :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The maps like Woosh are very very early maps for me, there's maps that I've made that I've removed that were made after that! So some of the techniques I've stopped doing (baddies in blocks).

I want to make larger levels, but the lack of people playing my maps was like a big boulder dragging me down. After you and some others playing my maps, giving feedback, I think I'm invigorated to make more! Longer! Better! :D

I'm thoroughly enjoying your maps too! I think, in my opinion, they are too long for 100xMario challenge. If I saw them in the 100x I would skip them, as they would take me too many lives to complete. Not because they are beyond me, but because of silly mistakes. I don't have Super Expert unlocked just yet, but with that mode you have 100x lives, but less levels, so you can put more effort in per level! I think it would help if Expert were more like this, instead of identical to Normal, but higher difficulty.

Either way, I'm playing through more of your levels, I'll favourite you, and hope you check out my future maps too! :D </TEXT>

Pretty sure I am setup correctly, gonna jump through your maps  now :)

Okay, so the first level I played of yours "airship of backtracking". Really neat premise, but I got stuck and couldn't figure out how to get to the first flag. The autoscroll compounds the difficulty for me too as it feels pretty panicky. I think I got close a few times, but I'm stopping that one as it's just frustrating me, did quite a bunch of tries, even explored other areas. Moving onto another map of yours now :D

Sure looks like my maps are a lot more simplistic than yours D: sorry in-advance.

oh, my, god, I just realized I've been playing /u/oledakaajel 's levels this whole time and thinking they were yours! I'm going to fix this, play yours and give feedback :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I think I'm going to look into the daily exchange thing. Sounds like a good idea. I think I'm going to avoid the twitch idea though as I think it might get me more attention than my maps reasonably warrant. While I think it's a helpful idea, I want my maps to be successful primarily because of their quality/merits, not just because a magnifying lens suddenly is pointed at it (so to say).

Thanks for the help tho! :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the last few months, I think I've had 2 or 3 deleted, and those levels were up for over a month. Them being deleted seemed pretty reasonable as they weren't taking off at all.

I know the deck is stacked against me, but I've also seen other people who are low scale, posting new maps, doing better than me (getting more plays/stars). So, there must be a way I can improve this.

I suppose sharing might be required to overcome this, but I'm really hoping to make progress based on the quality of my maps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like this proposal, and I'm willing to reciprocate. How about this though. I'm not sure how to "bridge the gap" between my Wii U profile and the "greater internet" profile. I know that there's a page on the internet with my Mario levels, but I'm not sure how to find it. Can you point me the relevant nintendo page so I can get my profile page for you?

When you say Bookmark profile, do I need to bookmark all my maps for you to see them? Or will my profile just show all the maps I have currently uploaded to people who view my profile?

As for reciprocation, how about this. I would love you to play all my levels, but I also would love to hear all your feedback. If you want to give any stars, please do so if you think they warrant it, I don't want to earn any stars if they aren't deserved. I'd love to hear your feedback so I can use it for better map making too! Pour it on me, even the small things!

Since you say you have only 12 uploaded, we're kind of on the same scope here. So, in return, link me to your profile, I'll figure out how to play them (if I get stuck I might need some help). Then I'll give you as much feedback as I can on each one, and star where I feel appropriate. Is there going to be a way for me also to view your profile on my Wii U? So far I've only found the ability to search for single map codes, not user profiles. How would I do that?

I want to make awesome maps, and I think giving back to those who help me seems very fair too! :D Thanks for your offer, let's make it happen? :) </TEXT>

I'm doing SMM primarily because I want to make awesome maps that people enjoy, with my own twist. I try to consider more and more as I do it, even small things that irritate people. For example, it seems like a lot of people don't like hammer bros, so I try to only use them in certain ways that aren't "punishing".

But yeah, daily level exchange, sounds like a solid idea! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I don't really know how the system works for presenting maps to players. I've seen lots of new and old maps, even unpopular ones, presented to me in 100 Mario Challenge, hence why I'm also confused.

What I've been doing is letting some maps sit and collect plays, but also reviewing the ones that aren't successful, removing them, either re-doing or adjusting them, and re-uploading. I don't re-upload a modified version of every one I've made, as I also work on new designs too. So, I think I'm making progress from a quality perspective, but I still feel a bit stuck.

As for posting for people here to play, I'm not against that, but I have been trying to have my maps become successful on their own merit. Since I'm now trying to reach out for help, maybe sharing is going to help a lot. I don't think sharing on here is cheating, but I also want to be rewarded fair and square for my hard work. Make sense? :)

So, it sounds like maybe I'm on the right track, but some points you make could help too. Yes? :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

Okay, before posting this, I read the rules as best as I could (sideboard is what I saw, I didn't see a rules page). Also tried a bit to see if there were any sort of FAQ stickies or something, but I didn't really find much, so I'm sorry if I'm talking about stuff that many others commonly ask/talk about too.

I got Super Mario Maker for the Wii U a few months ago, well after the massive hype it had.

I've been making and uploading levels periodically, each time analysing how people play the level. I try to identify what works, what doesn't and continually try to do a better job. I've been getting a bit more plays and a bit more stars than before, but not much.

I'm sitting on 11 stars, and reaching the 50 star first target seems very painful to me, since my my most popular level has 28 unique players and 2 stars. Yet at times it seems SMM just stops presenting my maps to players.

I'm trying to progress in the SMM world legitimately, not by gaming the system. But I'm having a hard time figuring out how to improve the number of people playing my levels naturally.

I can link to my maps if you guys really want to see them, but I'd love to hear some advice as to what can make a real difference in getting the maps to be more played.

I try to make maps that are fun, have interesting puzzles to them, and aren't super punishing hard. Right now aiming for more "Normal"/"Hard" (not quite Expert) difficulty. I'm not making maps that just award free wins to the players, hell I even put a fair bit of effort into hidden secrets too!

So, can you guys help me out here? What more could I be doing?

Thanks :D

edit: if you want to check my levels out, here's my profile : https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/profile/bl00dyiron?type=posted if you want to star/comment, that'd be appreciated, but only if they deserve it! :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Propaganda? Dude, I've been working with, and implementing computing technology since before there even was an ATX standard. What I'm saying is my professional experience, not formed by any sort of "propaganda" spouted by others. Relax, I'm very familiar with ATX, and many other formfactors.
2. While I agree with you about batteries, that doesn't mean it's going to happen. The players in the market have no interest in such thing at this time, even though it would benefit all of them.
3. When it comes to laptops and phones, standards of similar nature to ATX just won't fly. The industry changes way too much, and you need to remember there are so many details defining ATX, that they would prevent innovation in the laptop and phone sector.

If you take a look at the internals of a P4 laptop vs an early i5 laptop, vs even newer ones, it's very clear that motherboard designs alone drastically change between generations, manufacturers, and scopes of products. There are manufacturers that have taken it upon themselves to at least have their own unification of certain parts (Lenovo/IBM, Dell, etc). But standards like ATX speak about internal dimensions to such a specific degree, such things just would prevent laptops from being able to be an innovative sector. We wouldn't see motherboards shrink in size like we have seen, and batteries grow in-turn.

Phones, yes there are some directions that seem rather silly, like how thin they are. But if you reflect upon how phones have changed over the years internally, again you will find that if constraints were put in-place similar to the ATX standard, it would drastically limit innovation in the sector.

That being said, I think if there is going to be a standard for laptops similar to ATX, and/or a standard for phones in similar vein, we are probably the closest we could be to actually being able to intelligently design such a thing.

Technology has moved so fast, and not everything works everywhere as a result. ATX has achieved a tonne, but even now we see it's not enough. There's mATX, mini-ITX, EATX, and more. Hell, even though I've been working in the industry for so long, there's form factor's even now that I'm learning about! (notably in embedded systems). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People ship BILLIONS of dollars worth of goods all the time. Trusting a company to move something valuable to you because you don't have the resources is plenty reasonable, and is done by thousands of businesses and individuals every day. Them trusting another company to provide an important service isn't them not taking responsibility for their stuff, it's not about that.

A several thousand dollar computer, or rocket parts, or whatever the fuck it is, all of them have plenty of perfectly acceptable reason to be shipped by a company that's business model is safely moving things around. So, if you still can't see that as reasonable, then you are seriously detached from the rest of society.

	<TEXT> Computers, as in, the majority of the industry as we know it, became popular because of the ATX formfactor. This industry standard (and it is an ACTUAL standard, documented by Engineers and such), enabled people to repair computers, manufacturers to make parts that are interchangeable, OEMs to sell entire computers from parts made by others, and so much more. Computers were pretty strong before ATX, but the ATX standard was _SO GOOD_, it caused the industry to EXPLODE into the scale we see today.

This is why you can put ANY ATX motherboard in ANY ATX case, use ANY ATX PSU, and it is EXPECTED to work (assuming the parts actually are functional of course).

This has not been a feasible task to apply to Laptop design or phones, so you can't really compare the two.

However, I do agree that right to repair legislature is really required here with the direction phones have been going (Apple is just the best example of this fuckery). </TEXT>

You will probably never notice the difference in your workflow between a good SATA SSD and an NVMe device. Yes, it is faster, but you WILL NOT notice.

Plus, CPUs are a right pig to upgrade after the fact for laptops, and many laptops don't even let you do that. The NVMe upgrade probably can be done later if you somehow actually need it.

	<TEXT> No it's not. You can see plenty of benefits in dropping thermal temps without having to overclock. For starters, your CPU is likely to last longer. Then you're also wasting less power because the CPU is probably spending less power to operate. Also, you're spewing less heat into your work/living space, reducing how much cooling you need to do (stuff like this is important in areas like Nevada). And, your HSF is going to have to work less to be able to cool your CPU, which means you can drastically reduce the noise level of your HSF.

Again, dropping temps, does not, whatsoever, imply that overclocking is going to happen. That's like saying anyone who dusts out their HSF to drop temps must be doing it to overclock their CPU/compie. It's silly. </TEXT>
