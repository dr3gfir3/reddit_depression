	<TEXT> It's really frustrating when you're watching someone you care about making a mistake, and they don't seem to want to do anything about it, or they kind of dismiss it like it's doing to get better on its own. It's kind of like wanting to get hold of them and shake them up to say COME ON! Wake UP! Etc. Sadly that's not really how stuff goes cos there usually a bunch of circumstances that prevent things being that simple. Unfortunately it sounds like the only way he will learn, is the hard way. It's good that you care enough to get angry about this, so I hope you can still be mates even if it's at a distance etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's time to let him go. The thing is, him being ill inside is undignified for animals when they know they're supposed to do it outside, but can't because they're ill. When they get sick like this, they also decline mentally and they start forgetting who people are, they end up afraid and anxious and no amount of cuddles can settle them. It's not likely to get better because he's an old soul, and he already survived the odds. It's heartbreaking, I had to let my beloved bulldog go a couple of years ago because he was riddled with cancer. It was the hardest decision I had to make, but I didn't want him to suffer and lose his dignity because he was so sick and lost control of everything. I lost my heart that day. 

Ask your vet to come to your home and do it, so your doggo can be surrounded by familiarity and people who love him. It's time to let him go.  </TEXT>

Blokes use them if they're not very well endowed, and also might be made to use them so they can give pleasure, but not feel an awful lot. The latter seems to be a thing with kink couples where pleasure is only granted to the dominant side of a couple for headfuck reasons etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to upset you mate - I'm in forensic psychology, I happen to know a fair amount about masculine behaviour. Right now you're having a mantrum because you're outraged about something that hasn't even happened yet. The ideology of subscribing to a pecking order whereby one party is cuckolded at the hands of another, is indicative of the way hegemonic masculinity works, and is in fact perpetuated when testosterone fuelled men beat their chests and rage, rather than stopping to think like a reasonable human being. But sure, keep on fuelling those flames, it'll be dead helpful honest.  </TEXT>

And if the OP does indeed come back to say he got fucked over, then that would be horrible and unfortunate as fuck, but see here's the thing, *asking mr ripped what he's after and telling him to back off* will likely give him the info and/or confirmation he needs to read folks the riot act for being shit. Or you know, everyone could just carry on assuming without actually figuring out the extent of any bullshit involved. Cos if she's got plans to be unfaithful, wouldn't you rather know beforehand so you could keep some dignity and tell all concerned to go forth and multiply? 

Or maybe just listen to a few blokes who clearly haven't evolved past knuckle dragging stage. Gee.  </TEXT>

Really I think this has blown out of proportion, and maybe a conversation with all three people at the same time time would clear stuff up, and soon before it ends up eating a hole into things moreso than it already has.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She might be naive, but who's to say she would act on anything if he actively pursued her in that way? I mean okay if she DID, then yes absolutely it's out of order and the OP would be well within their rights to read them the riot act. However, if Casanova decides he's going to try his luck, he's the one to be angry with. If she wants to play for real, I would think some more secretive behaviour would be on the cards. Obviously let's hope nothing happens, because that would suck royally for the OP.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No - it's not her fault that a bloke decided to send ripped photos of himself to her. Weirdly enough, men like to do that along with other more southern parts of their anatomy, which he hasn't done. Again they have an open phone/password policy which is how this came to light. Cheaters cover tracks etc. If anything, the OP might want to get in contact with the guy to ask him what his motivations are. It's not really fair to blame her for the behaviour of someone else putting topless photos into view. 

It probably wouldn't hurt for a conversation with everyone involved to happen, so as to allay any fears. If he's got ideas about her, then it's the perfect time to say hey okay, that's really not on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Men wander about shirtless all the time, especially in gym and fitness environments. It's not like she sent a shirtless photo back. I don't think she's the problem here, she hasn't really done anything wrong. We're only seeing one side. She's allowed to have friends to ping pong messages with, otherwise it just seems insecure and potentially controlling.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think sharing memes and superficial conversation equates to an emotional affair. I have three super close friends I converse with on a daily basis, along with a few other friends and my partner. Some days I talk to my best friend more than my partner because we have more to talk about for whatever reason. My partner could be super busy at work, or he might be tired. Sometimes I go a couple of days between texting friends and then we will text frequently on others. These things vary. The point is that my friends and my partner are all aware I love them and they have value for their own reasons. Sharing memes and such really shouldn't be an issue, especially when they have an open phone/password policy with one another. If something were going on, it would be way more than it is now.  </TEXT>
