Optimizing network attacks by artificial bee colony
Manuel LozanoCarlos Garca-MartnezFrancisco J. RodrguezHumberto M. Trujillo

Abstract

 Over the past few years, the task of conceiving effective attacks to complex networks has arisen as an optimization problem. Attacks are modelled as the process of removing a number k of vertices, from the graph that represents the network, and the goal is to maximise or minimise the value of a predefined metric over the graph. In this work, we present an optimization problem that concerns the selection of nodes to be removed to minimise the maximum betweenness centrality value of the residual graph. This metric evaluates the participation of the nodes in the communications through the shortest paths of the network.

 To address the problem we propose an artificial bee colony algorithm, which is a swarm intelligence approach inspired in the foraging behaviour of honeybees. In this framework, bees produce new candidate solutions for the problem by exploring the vicinity of previous ones, called food sources. The proposed method exploits useful problem knowledge in this neighbourhood exploration by considering the partial destruction and heuristic reconstruction of selected solutions. The performance of the method, with respect to other models from the literature that can be adapted to face this problem, such as sequential centrality-based attacks, module-based attacks, a genetic algorithm, a simulated annealing approach, and a variable neighbourhood search, is empirically shown. </TEXT>

Disparities in Health Care Utilization and Functional Limitations Among Adults With Serious Psychological Distress, 20062014

DOI: 10.1176/appi.ps.201600260

Abstract:

 Objective:
 This study compared health care access, utilization, and functional indicators among adults with and without serious psychological distress (SPD) in the years surrounding implementation of the Patient Portable and Affordable Care Act (ACA).

 Methods:
 Adults ages 18 to 64 from the 20062014 National Health Interview Survey (N=207, 853) were examined on 11 access, utilization, and functional indicators: health insurance coverage (health coverage), insufficient money for medications, delay in health care (delay in care), insufficient money for health care, visiting a doctor ten or more times in the past 12 months, change in place of health care, change in place of health care due to insurance, limitations in ability to work, limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs), insufficient money for mental health care, and having seen a mental health care provider.

 Results:
 Multivariate models that were adjusted for health coverage and sociodemographic characteristics indicated that compared with adults without SPD, adults with SPD had greater odds of lacking money for medications (AOR=10.0) and health care (AOR=3.1), experiencing delays in care (AOR=2.7), visiting a doctor ten or more times in the past 12 months (AOR=3.2), changing usual place of health care (AOR=1.5), changing usual place of health care because of insurance (AOR=1.5), and experiencing limitations in ADLs (AOR=3.6) and ability to work (AOR=1.8). The proportions of adults with SPD who lacked health coverage and money to buy prescriptions increased during the study period. Although this trend reversed in 2014, the proportion with SPD experiencing barriers remained above 2006 levels.

 Conclusions:
 Health care patterns among adults with SPD require greater attention. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oops that's my fault as the OP for trusting the article text. The list was a direct cut and paste from the article itself. The actual article in the last paragraph had the 3 states repeated and all I did was cut and paste the list! Very sorry everybody!!! Mods, let me know if I should remove and repost. 

Although it raises the question for me - that leaves only 8 states. Where did the 11 come from then? It's looking more like the journalist made a mistake with his count. Should be 8 states, not 11.  </TEXT>
