	<TEXT> I answered pretty much like u/thebeeknee . I checked off all the boxes because all these things can be/are part of TTC but I also explained that it would be up to the mod to identify herself as not currently TTC or not in the "right" mindset to continue moderating, and that's fine, but to me having active mods is important. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same here!
My thermometer is by my bed and it's now second nature to temp the second I wake up. Not a drag for me at all, plus I love seeing the data on my chart haha.

As for OPKs, well I've taken close to 50 by now (first cycle I only did a few, second cycle took one every day for a month because fuck my long cycles), and I never got anything close to a positive... So my relationship with OPKs is not the best. I'ma  big drinker and I hate feeling dehydrated too, so I also find a 4-hour hold to be crappy. But seeing as how I never have CM to rely on either, I trudge on with OPK use, like a good TTC soldier haha! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both ways are used to take BBT. I also had assumed that it *had* to be vag. but oral is fine too (although temps can have a bigger variation orally), even with the variation it's possible to see a clear temp rise when you ovulate. </TEXT>

Been off HBC since August and had only 2 completed cycles: 105 days anovulatory, and 56 days with O at CD41. So... my plan now is to take OPKs almost every day and try to have sex every 2 days (3 maximum) until I see a temp shift.. -_- Not much more to do except try not to obsess! </TEXT>

Do you usually have long or anovulatory cycles or is this unusual for you?
Just letting you know I O'ed at CD41 last cycle, so there is still hope yet! But the cycle before that lasted 105 days with no O :(

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey u/SquidFarts , I usually manage to stay out of it too... But I feel a little bit in-between, with some TFAB posts from first-time BFPs can come off as irritating I agree, but also I've been lurking on stilltrying for a few weeks and have seen quite a few comments like the one above, which to me comes off as a bit hurtful (because I feel like I'd be judged for posting on stilltrying being only 6 months in) and intimidating. 

I totally agree that there definitely can be a lack of perspective from those only a few cycles in, but that's something I think we only realize once we're further down the road and we *do* have that perspective of having tried for a while and realizing that it's not that easy.

I just think that it's better when there's more support and less belittling. And I doubly agree that it's really hard to put into words, I always wonder if I'm getting across clearly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it normal to have such a huge temp difference in my pre-O temps? I've been between 96.2 and 97.2, I find that one whole degree is a lot :/
[Chart!](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/subject1257)

I temp orally and at pretty much the same time every day. I don't normally mouth-breathe either, and the 2 discarded temps from this weekend were because of wine the night before (2 glasses is enough to mess it up for me).

	<TEXT>  Those who have been trying for four months shouldn't get so upset and jealous of others getting pregnant right away.

I agree they *shouldn't*, but TTC is an emotional journey right from the start, and things get intense and emotional right from the start. I don't want to start a heated debate or anything, but just because someone has been trying for a few months vs. over a year does not mean they are not allowed to have negative feelings about not getting pregnant quickly...

I just hate when things turn into a *us vs. those who get pregnant quickly* debate...

And yes, my flair says cycle 3, it's not a mistake. I've **only** been trying for 6 months, but seeing as how I've ovulated just once, I know I'll be trying for a long while yet and am trying to gear up for that and to give and get support from the ladies on here and TFAB. Just my two cents about this.. </TEXT>

I've found that temping really helps me see what's going on, and it definitely doesn't feel like a big chore. After 5 months temping (6 months TTC), it's just automatic for me. I hope you fell the same way when you start temping! Good luck :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a link between high TSH and periods that are super lights and short? I'm trying to gather all the info I can, because I suspect my thyroid is not optimal for TTC

Stopped HBC in August (had 3 days withdrawal bleed), cycle 1: 105 days, anovulatory. 2.5 day period, then cycle 2 lasted 55 days (ovulated on CD41). My last period only lasted 1.5 days and was very light.

TSH was 3.7 in November

Hands and feet always frickin cold no matter how warmly dressed I am

I sleep 11-hours on weekends, and about 7 hours#night during the week, am always tired.

I haven't really gained weight though so this makes me doubt a bit (gained 5 pounds), but my mom has Hashimoto's and has always been super skinny even when she was in hypothyroid...

Could that be my problem? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the support. No meds for depression or anxiety thus far. I've been running on empty for too long and it's just hitting now.. I have to maintain my courage to bring it up to my doctor next week and we'll see what she says... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never properly welcomed you, so welcome! I hope your stay here is short :)

And I don't have endo but ouch, that sounds painful (I also had very painful intercourse for much of my life so, I know it sucks). :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do they tell you haven't ovulated strong enough, with CD21 blood tests to see progesterone?
I never got a positive OPK last cycle but I did ovulate (as per my temp rise), however that was my one and only ovulation since stopping HBC in August, so I'm worried lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aww that sucks, I hope you feel better soon. Sometimes it helps to just accept the day will not be productive, it just makes it twice as worse to feel guilty about it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man, Pumpkin you've got me teary-eyed in my cubicle hahaha....
Thank you for your kind words... I feel like I've been fending this off for a long time already and my energy reserves have run out. I think I'm at the point where I have to plough through the shame and tell my doctor that I'm not doing so well...

But that brings on another set of problems, like why the hell am I TTC if I'm not doing ok for myself? How do I think I'll be able to care for a baby if taking care of myself right now feels like a chore? I'm afraid my doctor will judge me for wanting a baby now even through this. Anyway, thank you for your comment, every shred of encouragement is taken and will help me... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it might depend, if your PCOS gets under control quite well you may not need another med for thyroid :)
I'm seeing my doctor next week so will have more news then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, that still doesn't sound like much fun :/
You take the Letrozole for 7 days?

I hope that that's enough to make your 7DPO levels ok, keep us updated on those! I'll be looking out for the rest of your story, as I'm afraid I'm not ovulating strong enough either! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow that's great news Aesuan, things are moving along! :) I'm happy you feel comfortable with your new doctor!

Your news on the TSH has got me a bit worried, mine was at 3.7 in November and I've got all kinds of symptoms of long cycles, anovulation, etc so I was thinking that might be the cause... I'll still ask my doctor about it though! </TEXT>
