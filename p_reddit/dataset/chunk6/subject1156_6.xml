	<TEXT> A reporter asked if Putin and Tillerson discussed Russia's meddling in the US election  as well as other cyberattacks. Tillerson didn't directly say that the two talked about Russia's role in the election hacking, but rather they "touched on" the broader issue of cyberattacks.

Lavrov, in turn, gave a similar answer, saying he doesn't want Russian citizens to become victims of cybercrime.

Putin has said that the claims that Russia meddled in US election are "lies." However, the FBI and intelligence committees from both the House and Senate in the US investigate the alleged interference in the US election, including possible ties between Russian officials and members of Trump's campaign team. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This remark: This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance, Page said in an interview Tuesday. I have nothing to hide. He compared surveillance of him to the eavesdropping that the FBI and Justice Department conducted against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr." convinced me that Carter Page did not have a Plebe Year in Annapolis. He definitely skated his way through and did not pay attention to what he was supposed to be learning about leadership and responsibility. 
 
He needs to go back to Memorial Hall in Annapolis and take another look at the names of the graduates who died in combat and in the line of duty. His actions, and denials, have failed those USNA graduates who made the ultimate sacrifice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Donny barely knows how to find the remote and get the TV on the right channel for Fox   Friends. So it's easy for me to believe that when his underlings negotiated the Russia deals, it was only about election rigging and Ukraine-related sanctions, and Donny never thought about Syria. I mean, he probably didn't know where it was, then. 
 
Now Assad tests him, and the Joint Chiefs tell Donny he has to bomb or he'll look weak compared to Obama .... that's still the most plausible scenario to me. You could get Donny to do ANYTHING if you told him not doing it would make Obama look good. </TEXT>

Russian President Vladimir Putin, in excerpts of an interview to be broadcast in full on Russian television later Wednesday, argued that there is no proof Assads forces carried out the attack and called the U.S. strikes a breach of international law.

Putin also said that confidence in an improvement in U.S.-Russian relations was lower now than it had been under the Obama administration </TEXT>

	<TEXT> putin said in an interview with state-run MIR television earlier Wednesday that relations with the US had deteriorated.
"The working level of confidence in Russian-American relations, especially at the military level, under the administration of Donald Trump, has not improved, but rather worsened."
A White House memo to the press last week mentioned a meeting between Putin and Tillerson had been scheduled, but the Kremlin appeared to have rolled back on the talks as the Syria rift worsened.
Putin has traditionally met with the US Secretary of State on their visits to Moscow. And Tillerson and Putin are no strangers -- Putin in 2013 awarded the Order of Friendship to Tillerson when he was CEO of ExxonMobil, the highest honor Russia gives to foreigners. </TEXT>

On Monday night, the White House hosted a kosher Seder dinner for staff members. Trump did not attend but tweeted: Happy Passover to everyone celebrating in the United States of America, Israel, and around the world. #ChagSameach.

After the briefing, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum tweeted a video showing footage taken when U.S. forces liberated a concentration camp in Germany in April 1945. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "..coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trumps favor." 
The cunning of Trump and the Trumpettes is that the only real evidence that can be held against their campaign is recorded phone conversations, emails   other electronic means. It seems that they knew that conversations are 'mere hearsay'.  
 
Since the FBI was investigating various people, well before Comey revealed a renewed investigation resulting from Weiner's computer, it's rather obvious that that revelation was to allay the rebels in the FBI who wanted Trump. 
It's also obvious that paid Russian regime internet activity, aimed at destroying Clinton, gained a lot of traction because of Comey's political gambit. 
Since Trump is a minority president it's always going to be a wonder by how much more he would have lost the popular vote, and perhaps the electoral college, if there was no paid, Russian government lies and obfuscation. 
It's now a delicate matter of the FBI wanting to deal with this embarrassing situation. I wonder how many discussions people there will be having about how to limit their culpability.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Swedish police have brought in seven people for questioning over an apparent terror attack in which a hijacked delivery truck mowed down pedestrians in Stockholm, killing four people, authorities said on Sunday.

A 39-year-old Uzbek man was arrested earlier as the suspected driver of the truck that rammed into crowds in the Swedish capital on Friday. The man had been known to Swedish security services but had no clear links to militant groups.

A further 15 people were injured when the beer delivery truck barrelled down a busy shopping street before crashing into a department store and catching fire.

"Seven people have been brought in for questioning as a result of these events," Jonas Hysing, national head of police operations, told public broadcaster SVT, after several raids on addresses around Stockholm over the weekend.

Hysing declined to give further information about the raids, but said "the evidence looks very strong" that the Uzbek man was the driver of the hijacked truck.

Vehicles have also been used as weapons in Nice and Berlin in the past year in attacks claimed by Islamic State militants.

Stockholm was returning to normality on a bright Sunday morning with police barricades taken down along the Drottninggatan street where the attack took place.

Hundreds of flower bouquets covered steps leading down to the square next to where the truck ploughed into the Ahlens department store, with more piled up under boarded-up windows. </TEXT>

A Reuters reporter described a loud bang shortly after Oslo's bomb squad arrived with a remote-controlled robot once the area was cordoned off by police late on Saturday night.

"The noise from the blast was louder than our explosives themselves would cause," a police spokesman said, adding that further investigation was needed to find out if the device had contained explosives.

The device, about 30 cm (1 ft) across, had appeared to be capable of causing only a limited amount of damage. Forensics experts will examine fragments to figure out what it was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one from the administration has yet articulated what they want the end game to be. Just last week, Tillerson said the Syrian people would decide the fate of Assad. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said removing Assad from power was no longer a priority. White House press secretary Sean Spicer earlier this week defended that position by saying its necessary to accept the political reality on the ground.  
 
At his briefing last night (after the attack), Tillerson confusingly warned against reading too much into the bombings. This clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for, the secretary said. I would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or posture relative to our military activities in Syria today. There has been no change in that status. What exactly does he mean by that? Is it still not a U.S. priority to take out Assad? Spicer cut off questioning before anyone could follow up.  
 
Nothing has changed! 
 
There is no follow up policy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Forget going on break: Pelosi wants Congress to talk about Syria now
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called on the House to return from its two-week break in order to debate whether to authorize military action against Syria.

The Presidents action and any response demands that we immediately do our duty. Congress must live up to its Constitutional responsibility to debate an Authorization of the Use of Military Force against a sovereign nation, Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, Friday, just 12 hours after US forces launched a missile strike on a Syrian airbase.
Here's the letter in full:

"Rather than meet violence with violence in an ever-escalating descent into chaos, the U.S. will respond to the chemical attack on Syrian civilians by immediately inviting the refugees already vetted into our country and making preparations to increase the number of refugees we admit tenfold. We also will make a major increase in our support of humanitarian work within Syria and Turkey and Jordan to support the hundreds of thousands of innocent people who have been displaced by this senseless civil war. This is how a 'great' nation stands with the victims of an illegal attack by an illegitimate regime on the citizens of its own country."

	<TEXT> Dog and pony show. This is just a coordinated distraction. Everybody knew. The Russian were notified. Syria knew well in advance the strike was coming (wonder how they knew) and they removed all sensitive and vital information plus people. Pointless waste of money and all it will do is escalate the situation.  
 
Now it should be pointed out that this illegal airstrike was not authorized by congress and republicans AGAIN are giving cover to Duh Con. When President Obama "REQUESTED AUTHORIZATION" to do this the REPUBLICAN Congress of "NO" said, NO. Why? Because they are WPOS! Now those same morons say this: 
-Trump: The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not! Duh Con didn't get approval.  
-Paul Ryan: gave Trump approval for Thursday nights airstrikes, in 2013 he said that Obamas proposed military strike cannot achieve its stated objectives and could make things worse. 
-Marco Rubio: Rubio has been blanketing the airwaves praising Trumps airstrikes, in 2013 he said that I have long argued forcefully for engagement in empowering the Syrian people, I have never supported the use of U.S. military force in the conflict. 
-Jason Chaffetz: sent out a tweet that read, God bless the USA! But in 2013, he said he would oppose the use of force in Syria on the grounds that he saw no clear and present danger to the United States that would justify using force. 
 
However it's jake with Duh Con. Anything to help distract from Trump/Russia Gate. 
Also, whatever Duh Con does is alright because he's all white. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before further unilateral military action from Trump, we have to know: Did Trump just happen to risk war or terrorist attacks against the US in order to create a yuge distraction from the news that Sunny Boy Jared did not disclose on his national security clearance form his multiple meetings with Russians during the transition, before being cleared for access to top-secret info on foreign countries? Jared's lawyer now says not reporting these multiple meetings were an "oversight" - this so Jared is not declared a felon and end up where his daddy is. Is this timing really just a coincidence, or did the master showman figure that the best way to cover Jared's lies was to make a big show of attacking the friend of his friend Putin? Remember, Russia was informed of the attack before it occurred. I can just hear the conversation--Trump will attack Syria (whose refugees Trump won't allow into the US), but not destroy Assad's chemical weapons, as a show that he can stand up to Bully Assad and Bully Putin, as a cover to prove that he and his favored son-in-law are not really in bed with the Russians. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Limited access to sites in Syria often makes proving or debunking claims difficult. However, autopsies conducted by Turkish doctors on Thursday have confirmed that chemical weapons were used in the attack. The autopsies were conducted under the supervision of the World Health Organization. Doctors Without Borders have said that the victims showed symptoms that were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent.

Any other president at any other time might have been able to ignore the false flag narrative  Trump, like his predecessors, has at his disposal an entire intelligence community that can offer expertise and context. He doesn't need to listen to obscure online voices if he doesn't want to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the mouth of Rachel Maddow over at DNCTV after Reid nuked the Senate in 2013 
 
Wonder how she will "report" the events of today??? 
 
And you know what? Democrats just decided they had had enough. After years of fighting about this and pleading and promising and fuming and plotting and threatening over and over and over again, that they would do something about this if Republicans kept it up, today, Democrats finally actually did something. You could have knocked me over with a feather. They called for an appeal of a parliamentary ruling on the floor of the Senate by a majority vote, they overturned the parliamentarian`s ruling. It seemed like kind of a quiet exchange, but in doing that, they changed the rules of the United States Senate, so Republicans cant just block judges anymore. Judges can be blocked on an up or down vote, on a majority vote, like always, but they cannot be blocked anymore with just a minority of votes. Republicans cannot force that anymore. And I know, as Im hearing myself saying it, I know that it sounds like its not that much of a change, but this is a huge freaking deal. This is like 3-inch headlines. This is like people who dont even care about politics really ought to care about this.
