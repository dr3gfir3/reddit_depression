	<TEXT> So I've been hearing from a lot of people on the battlefield one subreddit that the recent AA nerf is another example in a long line over multiple battlefields of dice favoring pilots. I can understand since they are nerfing the best counter plane tactic in the game, but not nerfing the truly OP trench fighter. 

My question is; dice how can you let pilots get the scores they get (usually in operations) and decide to nerf AA guns but not trench fighters? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take down planes all the time, I have over 200 kills with the AA gun. Feel free to look up my stats as I just looked up yours. I'm not sniping in the back of the map, considering my SPM is higher than yours. Look up stats before you talk shit. I also see you've gotten a third of your kills in planes, letting me know exactly why you're biased in this way.

The problem is there isn't anything other than the AA gun worth a shit at taking planes down and they are nerfing them. Nevermind that they don't respawn in operations. </TEXT>

I'd like lots of good guns please.  </TEXT>

Make more good guns, not more bad ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They already made the 10-A kinda bad with their last nerf. Used to be one of my favorites, now in the "nerfed by dice" bin. Assaults are supposed to be wrecking houses up close, and that means more explosives and grenades. they have no great medium range capabilities, so are very powerful up close. And you think we should essentially take away their best gadget because you are tired of dying to it.

Things are balanced, if Dice listened to players like you there wouldn't be any guns or gadgets worth using.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been seeing pilots post around here like the AA nerf is a good thing while they go 50-0 or 100-1. One even had the audacity to post a thread about how to counter planes, which essentially told us to hide. Pilots always use the same word when they describe the things that counter them, "annoying" which perfectly explains the problem. The counter measures in the game don't kill them, or disable them, they annoy them. 

Pilots fess up to the fact that if you're remotely decent with a plane you're guaranteed lots of kills and there isn't much the enemy team can do to take you down. The current strategy of acting like the AA nerf is warranted and its soooo hard to be a pilot just make me and others, I'm sure, dislike you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My suggestion is things are fine   balanced and you are whining because you don't like dying to AT greanades. The assault class gets powerful grenades partly because their guns are peashooters at any kind of range. It is a balancing thing. 

But you didn't think of that, you thought "I'm sick of dying to AT grenades, dice plz nerf"  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are a lot of guns in this game that don't have much of a purpose when compared to their peers. The 12g shotgun is one example. I've heard that dice starts nerfing things when too high of a percentage of players are using that thing. I propose instead of making our good guns bad, just buff the bad ones and make more guns good. Players are much more excited when something gets buffed than when the hellreigal takes yet another nerf </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They will probably nerf it a 5th and 6th time too since their little "player statistics" say too many people use it. 

Dice just wants us all to use 12g shotguns along with the other useless weapons  </TEXT>

Whats wrong with discussion questions? Why won't the mods let them stay up? if they are bad they will get downvoted. I miss the way the sub was 3 years ago when you could talk about what you wanted. Now you can talk about what the mods approve of. </TEXT>
