	<TEXT> Yes you do need to watch the movie - just because it's awesome! There is indeed lots of glass, and it does indeed serve in the manner outlined above. For me it's also used to fracture the reality of the world the film creates. Scenes are sometimes filmed in part as reflections in glass - so two or even three perspectives can be layered into the image at once. The reality of the film, as well as reality as the characters in the film experience it, is hard to pin down - illusive. The use of glass at once comments on the experience of the characters, and at the same time exposes a meta-narrative, meaning that the director wants us to question the reality of what we are witnessing, and thereby question the *meaning* of what we are witnessing. He doesn't want us to stop thinking. In this way too the glass reminds us of the lens - of the glass that exists in the lens of the camera. This in turn references the strong narrative thread in the movie (to which both the children are connected) that is about cinema itself. This is indeed a 'post modern' film in that among its myriad functions it is in part concerned with deconstructing and discussing film itself. Yi Yi is an extraordinary work of art! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What a deeply thought out interpretation of this film. I'm especially taken with the economic context you have described - something I hadn't considered before. But there seems to be an overwhelmingly pessimistic tone to your interpretation I recognise only in part from the film (if I understand your post correctly - I confess some of it is beyond me!). For me *Yi Yi* is a film that touches on the idea of transcendence through a kind of giving in - an abandonment of striving and of questioning - a submission. This is perhaps neither a good nor a bad thing - neither pessimistic nor optimistic. It is what it is, and in a way requires that the audience submit in a similar way to the characters in the film. On a spiritual level it's very beautiful. But in such a film many many interpretations can and do exist at once - this is what makes it a great work of art. Thanks for your post.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People of askculinary. I can make a hollandaise sauce with my eyes shut. With one eye open I can make it foaming. I can slow roast a haunch of venison to pink perfection and my puff pastry is the talk of the neighbourhood. **But** -  I CAN NOT peel a hard boiled egg. I can't do it, and every attempt ends in a big boiled egg mess in my worktop and language that would make a sailor's eye's water. I *need* your helpful hints and tips.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really expect anything from Reddit - it is what it is. Having expectations of the internet is a losers game! I started looking at this sub in the hope that it might lead me to some great movies I hadn't seen. This hasn't really happened - I'm not boasting when I say I've seen all the great movies - I'm sad about it and also it's an indication of how old I am! Having said that I have over the past few years seen three or four excellent films I didn't know about because they were mentioned on this site and I'm grateful for that. 

Personally I find that often armchair cineasts have very fixed ideas about film, and many posts are an opportunity for them to tell the world what they think about a certain film or director (and i totally include myself in this group). If I agree I agree - if I don't I don't - but because of this many posts seem to be conversation stoppers rather than starters! What I really respond to are posts that ask a question about a particular aspect of film making (e.g. photography - editing - music - acting styles etc) using maybe two or three films as examples, rather than posts about one specific film. 

I wouldn't try and change anything about Truefilm - as another comment suggests, the only way to raise the bar here is to make some good posts of your own. 

(One last grumble - there are far too many posts about Kubrick and Christopher Nolan!)

	<TEXT> Hi folks
A few months back they had lovely looking quince (quinc*es*?) at the market, so I bought a dozen and bottled them in sweet syrup with star anise, cinammon and vanilla. How would you fit these into a meal? I'm not sure if I should go savoury or sweet. I've got a pheasant and a few partridges in the freezer, and I've got an idea the quince might work with game....? Or should i just eat them with icecream? Any thoughts appreciated :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen *The Conformist* twice. My memory of it is always preoccupied with style - obviously it's an incredibly stylish film. But what is it *about*? I'm pretty handy at deconstructing movies, but I wouldn't be able to help you out with *The Conformist*. I'd need to see the movie again and really focus on meaning and subtext. Sometimes I do this without really intending to, but there's something about Bertolucci that simply does not invite this kind of analysis for me. My favourite Bertolucci by far is *Last Tango*, and I've seen that film many times, but still I don't think I could sit down and tell you what it's *about*. I find watching his films a bit like watching Opera. He has the ability to create these beautiful set pieces (a bit like arias) that you just want to sit back and drink in. It's self indulgent sure, but good God - the beauty of what he can do! Such beauty can't be wrong! But what does it *mean*? I don't know! </TEXT>

Edit - OK, *last time* I promise - you simply must add *Spirit Of The Beehive* - essential!

Edit: I feel like I could keep making suggestions for *Eternity And A Day*. But I won't. Certainly not for *Eternity And A Day*. You will have to wait for *Eternity And A Day* to hear from me again that's for sure.

	<TEXT> Your foreign director's list is *amazing*. You are going on an incredible journey there - I am jealous. If I could compel you to make a couple of additions (I apologise if these are films you have already seen): 

Additional Dardenne brothers: *L'enfant* and *Rosetta*  

Additional Kiarostami: *10*  

Additional Varda: *Vagabond* (essential)

And you have *no* Pialat on your list - Sacr Bleu! Add *Nous Ne Vieillirons Pas Ensemble*, *La Gueule Ouverte*, *Loulou*, *A Nos Amours* (essential), and *Van Gogh*. 

I'm also not seeing Blier's *Les Valseuses*. 

Have you seen Truffaut's *Les Quatre Cent Coups*? Add that too. 

But wow - even without my suggestions you're in for quite an experience with that list! Tell us how it goes!

Edit: Personally I would also add Desplechim's *Rois Et Rien* - but that's a very personal choice there! (Also *Tuesday, After Christmas* - OK I'm going to stop now)

(And *Les Enfants Du Paradis*...  I can't stop!)

I don't see *Kes* :-( </TEXT>

	<TITLE> No-puff pastry fail </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-04 17:59:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello wise and helpful kitchen elves. 

Puff pastry fail. I make my own puff pastry and have had no problems with it.... up until last night when I made a venison wellington for a dinner party. Major fail. The pastry totally failed to puff and I had to sit through that grimmest of social trials where polite guests feel they must eat a layers of sweaty looking grey dough and go 'mmmmmm lovely pastry' or else witness you attempting to slash you wrists with a carving knife. I can think of a few reasons this might have gone so wrong - but I could use a second opinion. Here's the facts:

-I was not cooking in my own home with my own oven. 

-The pastry had been in the freezer for about three weeks and I removed it probably two hours before using it. I did not defrost in the fridge but at room temperature. 

-I struggled with the host's rolling pin, which is much lighter and thinner than my own, and I remember wondering at the time if I was rolling the life out of my pastry. 

-On removing the wellington from the fridge I remember thinking the pastry seemed somewhat damp and sticky - this didn't feel right. 

-The oven was gas, unlike mine which is electric, but I did have an oven thermometer with me and the wellington went in at 200C (390F). 

So was it the rolling? The temperature (too warm)? The unfamiliar oven? I'm thinking it was a rolling problem, and also maybe I left the dough to get too warm before hand. Anyone else?

	<TEXT> Reposting this as it failed to appear on the main page - no idea why - 

I enjoy listening to the Slovenian Cultural theorist and film critic Slavoj Zizek. I recently heard him state the three best films ever made were The Fountainhead (USA 1949), Opfergang (Germany 1944), and Ivan The Terrible (USSR 1944). I don't know if Zizek is being sincere about this - he enjoys a joke after all, and I know these films are all works of propaganda for either far right views (Zizek is a socialist) or totalitarian regimes. I have seen none of the films and they are difficult for me to get hold of without spending a lot of money on DVDs. I was wondering if any truefilmers had an opinion on any of these three films. Is Zizek pulling my leg, or are these great works of art? Any comments welcome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your reply - but just to be clear, this is maybe one almond in twenty that tastes absolutely disgusting. The other 19 taste great. I've read online that these odd almonds are those where the oils have oxidised. I read that even the almond producers are at present unable to detect which almonds have become rancid. They're working on new technology all the time to try and tackle the problem. That's just what I read. :-) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Everybody. I've been using almonds a lot recently and am very much bothered by the rogue 'bad almond' in the bag. This evil little nut infiltrates almond dishes and gives them a background note of nasty chemical bitter taste. The bad nut looks *exactly the same* as all the others! Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution? I'm (apparently) very sensitive to bitter and the bad almond taste puts me off a dish completely. Today I opened a treasured jar of apricots and almonds in amaretto I bottled back in July, only to detect that familiar unwelcome bitter note! Gah! The swines have tainted my much anticipated apricots! Help! (FYI: I buy organic whole almonds from the health food store). 

Edit one day later: Just to clear this up, I've found out that 'bitter almonds' are a different variety of almond that contain a higher amount of cyanide. My problem bad-tasting almonds are (I'm assuming) regular sweet almonds that have gone bad. Thanks for all your replies so far! :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to pick *Wild Strawberries*. I have a sense that it's a little looked down upon among Bergman's films - not quite up there with *Seventh Seal* for example (which I find kind of a struggle). Perhaps this is because *Wild Strawberries* is so easy to watch, or perhaps Bergman's character study is considered a little by-the-book or too easy. But for me the film comes close to communicating a real human experience and a real human mind, complete with all of its mysterious poetry. Dreams, memory, accident - everything tumbles together to guide the central character towards love. This happens in life, and inadequate though it is, it's perhaps the best evidence we can have of the presence of God. The idea that Bergman captured it in this movie and presents it with such artistry and care is something I find very moving. I come back to *Wild Strawberries* every few years and each time it means more to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi icecreamers!
How exciting to find a sub dedicated to ice cream - surely the food of the Gods. 
I have a dinner party coming up next weekend and for dessert I'd like to make an ice cream. I have in my store cupboard a jar of cherries preserved in brandy and also a jar of apricots and almonds in amaretto. I'd like to use one of the jars for an ice cream. I could of course just make a batch of delicious vanilla and spoon the fruit over that, but I'd like to go fancy. My idea so far is to make an almond/choc chip/cherry ice cream and maybe reduce the alcohol syrup from the jar to make a sauce. Anyone have a delicious alternative? </TEXT>
