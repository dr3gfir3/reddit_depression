	<TEXT> Simpson's Lawyer Hints Slayings Were Mistake by Drug Dealers

Published: March 9, 1995

LOS ANGELES, March 8 The chief defense lawyer and the chief police investigator in the O. J. Simpson case continued their seemingly endless fencing match today, delving into topics lik ethe rate at which ice cream melts and the murder methods used by Colombian drug lords.

The lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., elaborated on his assertion that Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were not the victims of a jealous former husband but of irate drug dealers who had set out last June to kill one of Mrs. Simpson's friends -- one of their customers -- instead.

Continuing his effort to offer some plausible alternative to the prosecution's case, Mr. Cochran suggested that the very brutality of the killings indicated that the perpetrators were drug dealers out to collect a debt, and that the real target was Faye Resnick, who was living with Mrs. Simpson, and taking drugs, around the same time.

In yet another round of questions for the detective, Tom Lange, Mr. Cochran implied that the police had turned a "blind eye" to any theories that would have cleared Mr. Simpson of the crimes. He also hinted that Mr. Lange implicated Mr. Simpson last June because Marcia Clark, the chief prosecutor in the case, already had.

Mr. Cochran's most graphic questions, concerning the brutal techniques used by Colombian drug lords, were intended to challenge an assertion by Mr. Lange that most drug-related killings do not involve knives. It was one of many reasons Mr. Lange offered for his conclusion that drugs had nothing to do with the crimes.

Mr. Cochran asked Mr. Lange whether he had ever heard of two ways drug dealers disposed of drug users in arrears: a "Colombian necklace," slang for murder by slashed throat, and a "Colombian necktie," a variation in which the victim's tongue is pulled through the slit.

In a series of thinly veiled "hypothetical" questions, he then asked the detective whether his views would have changed had it turned out that Ms. Resnick had lived briefly with Mrs. Simpson shortly before the killings, had been "freebasing cocaine on a daily basis" while there and had been too broke to pay for her habit.

"If I felt this was a drug-related murder, certainly," Mr. Lange said. "But that wasn't the evidence that I had and that wasn't the path that I pursued. I had nothing to lead me in that direction."

Mr. Cochran then asked why, if the investigation is ongoing, Mr. Lange had still not pursued the matter. "You don't turn a blind eye on evidence just because it might point toward Mr. Simpson's innocence, do you?" he asked.

The detective replied: "The fact that a victim's friend uses drugs is of very little consequence to me. The fact that every bit of evidence that I have in this case points towards the defendant has a lot more to do with it."

Mr. Cochran asked him whether Mr. Lange was speaking for himself or, really, for Ms. Clark.

"My theory has always been there was only one murderer," Mr. Lange said. "I don't know what her theory is. I believe her theory is the same as mine."

Questioned by prosecutors earlier, Mr. Lange testified that the very savagery of the slayings pointed to a different breed of killer. Drug-related killings, he said, are cleaner and more efficient, carried out with guns. "This appeared to me to be an overkill or a rage killing," he testified.

Mr. Lange will return to the stand on Thursday, two weeks after he first sat there.

Judge Ito made little effort today to rein in the defense lawyer, even when his questions were repetitious or beyond the scope of Ms. Clark's direct examination. At the current pace, Ms. Clark warned Judge Ito at the bench on Tuesday, "this case is going to go on for the next century."

Once Mr. Lange steps down -- and after a brief appearance by Patty Goldman, Mr. Goldman's stepmother -- the stage will finally be set for the much-anticipated testimony of Detective Mark Fuhrman, the man who found behind Mr. Simpson's house a bloody glove matching one found at the crime scene. Defense lawyers say Mr. Fuhrman is a racist who may have placed the glove there to frame Mr. Simpson; for months they have dropped his name ominously at every opportunity.

At a news conference this afternoon Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles District Attorney, called assertions that Mr. Fuhrman was "a make or break witness" for the prosecution "hype on the media's part." Mr. Garcetti would not say whether prosecutors would bring up Mr. Fuhrman's racial attitudes themselves in an effort to defuse the issue.

After the defense allegations surfaced, police officials questioned the 14 officers in the Simpson case about Mr. Fuhrman's conduct. Today, Judge Ito ordered that those interviews be furnished to the defense. And, as Mr. Simpson's lawyers had also requested, he directed the relevant police officers to tell the defense anything Mr. Fuhrman might have told them about Mrs. Simpson's "breast augmentation" -- a manifestation, Mr. Simpson's lawyers have hinted, of his obsession with her.

But he denied a defense request for information regarding what it said was "a swastika or other Nazi-like insignia" Mr. Fuhrman may have kept at the station house, saying it was "irrelevant."

In her turn with Mr. Lange, Ms. Clark played a video of police officers closing -- or, in law-enforcement lingo, "breaking down" -- the crime scene. It showed one officer taking down and crumpling up yellow police tape and another picking up the bloody sheet that had covered Mrs. Simpson while, in a Fellini-like touch, a young boy on roller skates careened by.

The defense had used a frame from that video, without saying when it was taken, to suggest that the police had traipsed willy-nilly through the crime scene; Ms. Clark hoped to show that the picture was clearly taken after care was no longer needed.

Then it was Mr. Cochran's turn. Usually glib and silver-tongued, he had a hostile, impatient edge as he questioned Mr. Lange. Some questions were prefaced with an incredulous "You're the lead investigator in this case and you've never . . . ?" Others were sarcastic, like one posed after Mr. Lange testified that Mrs. Simpson's family, and not the police, had ascertained the flavor of the ice cream found at her home after the killings.

"The Brown family, they're not members of the L.A.P.D., are they?" he asked sharply.

Mr. Cochran contends that had the melting rate of the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream been tested, it would have revealed a time of death too late for Mr. Simpson to have committed the crimes. That ice cream was ordered by Mr. Simpson's young son; but Mr. Cochran faulted Mr. Lange for failing to test the melting rate of rainforest crunch, the flavor Mrs. Simpson had ordered and apparently finished eating.

Mr. Cochran tried to extract mea culpas from Mr. Lange for various investigative mistakes. He asked Mr. Lange whether he had learned in the police academy to carry potentially important evidence under his arm rather than in a box.

Told that a coroner's assistant had failed to preserve the blood on Mrs. Simpson's back, as Mr. Lange had requested, Mr. Cochran asked whether the two had conversed in English.

Mr. Lange did his best to repress his annoyance, answering with a straight face questions like whether he had ever read any books about the need to place the hands of crime victims in plastic bags. Sometimes, however, he managed to say more.

He brushed aside suggestions that he had not sufficiently considered the degree to which Mrs. Simpson's blood had settled in ascertaining the time of death.

"He was cooperative to the extent that he sat down and spoke with us," Mr. Lange said. "I don't believe he was cooperative in being entirely forthcoming with us."

	<TEXT> **Mary Anne Gerchas**: Reported that she saw four men fleeing the crime scene. One Caucasian, two Hispanic. None was O.J. Simpson. The Prosecution claimed she was not even in the area that night. She pleaded guilty for fraud unrelated to the Simpson matter.

**Lief Tilden**: Stated that he saw four men at Bundy.

**Frank Chiuchiolo**: Claimed to be near the crime scene, casing a house for burglary. Saw Caucasian and Latino men at the Crime Scene about the time of the murders. The Defense decided not to call the convicted felon to testify.

Moore films are my favorite because those were the ones I grew up watching, but I can guarantee you'll The Spy Who Loved Me. :) To me, they're all great  the only one I really think was eh was A View To A Kill, but you can't deny it had an awesome theme song!'

You know, even crappy Bond films are STILL good (with the exception of some of those Brosnan flicks). lol Enjoy!

	<TITLE> "The only good n_____ is a dead n_____."  Mark Fuhrman </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-09 19:19:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> On August 31, Judge Ito ruled that evidence could be introduced to prove that Fuhrman had lied about use of the word "nigger", but that claims of violence and police misconduct were inadmissible.[28] On September 5, the defense produced multiple witnesses and audiotape to establish that Fuhrman had used the word "nigger" within the last ten years.[5] The audiotape eventually resulted in a perjury conviction for Fuhrman.

First, Laura Hart McKinny took the stand. Between 1985 and 1994, Fuhrman gave taped interviews to McKinny, a writer working on a screenplay about female police officers. Fuhrman was working as a consultant for McKinny, under the understanding that he would be paid $10,000 if a movie were produced. The recordings contain forty-one instances of the word "nigger" used as recently as 1988,[32] including references in which he claimed to have perpetrated violence against African-Americans.[29] In the recordings, Fuhrman also describes how, as a police officer, he thought lying was sometimes necessary and claims that he has provided testimony regarding events that he did not actually witness.[29]

After McKinny, witness Kathleen Bell testified. She met Fuhrman at a Marine recruiting station in 1985 or 1986,[32] where he expressed animus against interracial couples and stated, "If I had my way, all the niggers would be gathered together and burned."[32][2][33] Then, witness Natalie Singerwhose roommate had dated Fuhrman around 1987testified that Fuhrman had told her, "The only good nigger is a dead nigger."[2][32] On the television show Leeza, Singer would later state that Fuhrman had also claimed, "Yeah we work with niggers and gangs. You can take one of these niggers, drag 'em into the alley and beat the shit out of them and kick them. You can see them twitch. It really relieves your tension."[34] However, Judge Ito restricted her from giving her complete statement during the trial.[35] Roderic Hodge then testified that while he was in police custody in 1987, Fuhrman had said to him, "I told you we would get you, Nigger."[36][37]

Ultimately, the jury was only allowed to hear two excerpts from the Fuhrman tapes, which did not include the inflammatory violent content or material related to potential misconduct. Jurors heard Fuhrman say, "We have no niggers where I grew up," and, "That's where niggers live."[28] With the jury absent on September 6, the defense asked Fuhrman whether he had ever falsified police reports or if he had planted or manufactured evidence in the Simpson case. Although he had earlier responded "no" when asked this question, this time he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination on his lawyer's advice.[38]

During his closing argument, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran referred to Fuhrman as "a lying, perjuring, genocidal racist"[39] and he analogized Fuhrman to Hitler.[40] He argued that Fuhrman had planted the bloody glove on O.J. Simpson's estate as part of a racially motivated plot against Simpson, which could be traced back to his first meeting with the interracial couple in 1985.[39] Although there was no evidence to suggest that Fuhrman had planted the glove, his perjury regarding use of the word "nigger" was widely seen as severely damaging the prosecution's credibility in front of the mostly black jury (especially in the wake of the Rodney King trial[41]), and it has been cited as one of the key reasons that Simpson was acquitted.[3]

	<TEXT> Great questions. I'll try my best to answer...

**Why does OJ run?**

He never "ran". It was the media who called it a "chase". He just lost his ex-life, his image, and was heavily sedated/depressed. And he knew that from this point on, he'd be a victim of character assassination and his career would be over. Remember, he had already been accused (even put in handcuffs), and he had been told his blood was "found" at the scene. There was no way out. He knew he'd be stuck with being tagged a "murderer" whether he did it or not  and that's exactly what happened. My thinking is that he wanted to see his family (in addition to the above) one more time before being put behind bars for months  as he knew he'd be tried. But remember, this wasn't a chase. If it were a chase, they'd be going faster than 40 mph (and AC wouldn't be assisting him, especially in another high-profile, white Bronco). 

**Why did OJ have a disguise in his car and money?**

The disguise he had in his bag before he was even arrested (Kardashian questioned him about it, when he saw it in his bags on his way back from Chicago... ). As he states "What am I going to do with a beard? I'd still look like OJ Simpson without it" or something like that. The money, from what I remember, was to be given to Al Collings, because OJ knew he'd be heading to jail, so he wanted to give some cash to certain family members while he'd be locked away for what might be days/months. A lot of people relied on OJ's income at this time, including the Browns, even after his break up/divorce with Nicole.

**Why did OJ fail a lie detector test?** 

Simpson told Rob Kardashian he had flunked the test because he was very emotional. Legal professionals agree that this is a common problem with lie detector tests. The American Psychological Association has even claimed that the science behind polygraphs can be "controversial." Innocent people can sometimes respond like guilty people, depending on how they react under stress and the types of questions asked. Likewise, it is supposedly possible to "beat" lie detector tests if you know how to control your answers and reactions. 

**Why did OJ not know how he cut his finger?**

There have been times when I have gotten cuts, scrapes and bruises where I didn't know they came from. It is a proven fact that broken glass was found in his Chicago room (there's photos of it), which happened after he went nuts upon hearing about Nicole's murder. When someone dies, especially family, your mind is all over the place. When being questioned by the two cops, his mind was most likely going 10,000 MPH. It was only later, when calmed down, that he realized how he cut it.

Remember, one cut doesn't leave a trail of blood from one place, to another. To me, it makes more sense that the blood was taken from the vile of OJ's sample (Taken from the two cops). They even proved that the vile was missing blood! (let's not forget about the blood that appeared on the gates three weeks later). There are photos to prove this.And those drips look pretty precise (as if it were dropped with care). 

**Why did Cato tell investigators that before the murders OJ told him he was going to get burgers and needed money then Cato tagged along and OJ used his own money for the burgers and not the money Cato gave him.**

Not sure about this. But here's a fact: Cato had stated that during their hamburger trip, OJ was in sports attire, including his shoes, which were Nike/Reebok-type running shoes. The shoe prints that were found at the murder scene were Bruno Magli "dress" shoes (if you want to get really technical, those particular shoes had soles, which were attached to over 50 different shoe brands, but that's another story...) If you look at the time line (the McDonalds visit is around this time spectrum....the last thing anyone saw OJ do before the murder took place), why the heck would OJ dress up in dress shoes then go on a killing spree? (it would be the other way around, right?) Also, when you're in a "jealous" rage (immediate nature of rage that occurs before deliberation), would you really be wanting to go for a quick meal, let alone dress up, wear gloves, a knit cap? They were divorced, broken up for months. OJ had a hotter gf and was happy.There are letters of Nicole wanting to get back with OJ. I don't buy the jealous/rage theory. The prosecution and the media planted this in our heads, because it makes good ratings/a good way to give the guy a motive when they never had one. 

**My deal...**

I'm not saying OJ did it. I'm not saying he didn't do it. But the correct answer for everyone should be "I don't know..." Nobody has the right to say anything else. I think there's something hidden deep in this OJ murder thing that'll sadly, never be explained.

One thing I really dislike about the public is they don't look at the facts before speaking. They usually jump to a conclusion after watching Dr. Phil or something. That's what's wrong with society. Everyone hitches the bandwagon instead of actually "thinking" for themselves.

The defense received a bad rap for playing the race card (especially Johnnie's "Hitler" analogy), but when you have a proven racist (the guy even collects Nazi memorabilia "because of its craftsmanship") who found the most damning evidence, race is a factor. In this case, race/fact came into play. 

The jury were no idiots. If I were on the stand, I would have set him free as well (again, I'm Filipino, not black...)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Shortly after Simpson was found not guilty of the murder of Brown and her friend Ron Goldman, longtime Simpson friend Rob Kardashian told ABC's 20/20 that he was shocked to learn that his friend had taken, and failed, a polygraph test. He said at the time that Simpson told him he had flunked the test because he was very emotional.

	<TITLE> Media's misleading statement: Ron Goldman was a "good samaritan" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-03 10:37:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One misleading statement that was repeated a thousand times in the media was that Ron Goldman was a "good samaritan." Here's the truth: Ron Goldman was a drug dealer and became a confidential informant while he was Nicole's boyfriend (or at least one of her boyfriends). 

On the night of the murders, Ron was bringing misplaced sunglasses to his girlfriend. This is how one book describes their relationship: "They exercised and attended dance clubs together, and often met for coffee and meals." Ron was noted as playing with Nicole's kids and walking the dog with her as well. As Nicole's neighbor Beverly Newman put it: "I thought they were married."

Also, on the night of the murders, Nicole had lit candles, drew a bath, put on music and made sure she was scantily clad in dark nglige when Ron arrived. In other words, they were boyfriend and girlfriend (not that there's anything wrong with that  but the media won't tell you that). 

Calling Ron a "good Samaritan" suggested that he was just being nice and had no other reason for being there. This was carefully worded to drive home the lie that Nicole was the target. Saying Ron was "in the wrong place at the wrong time" is a statement that already suggest OJ's guilt (Because if Nicole is a target, that puts OJ at the top of the suspect list). 

The reality is much more likely to be that Ron was followed home to be butchered and that Nicole was in the wrong relationship at the wrong time. How can I say such a thing? For multiple reasons, but let's center on motive, something the prosecution just couldn't get over: the fact that OJ had no motive for these murders. 

OJ was wealthy, dated underwear models, had a good relationship with his ex-wife prior to marrying Nicole. They had both signed a prenuptial agreement that left him relatively unscathed by the divorce. He had an incredibly high "Q" rating and was flying around the country on business trips for Hertz and other lucrative ventures. In other words: it was good to be the "Juice" back then. 

Through the whole trial, the prosecution could never put a coherent motive on the table, not to mention that his own children were upstairs  and we are to believe he left a pool of blood for them to come down and see?  I don't buy it. 


But who would have motive to kill Ron Goldman? (maybe someone who knew he was a confidential informant!?).
