	<TEXT> It's totally not one of the Street Fighter movies. 
Way more recent than those.

Sonny Chiba was not in the one I'm thinking of.

And if I remember correctly Street Fighter was a tad on the gorey side?
This was more like non lethal fighting. Kind of like Tokyo Raiders in the light heartedness.
If that makes any sense.

Thanks for the reply though! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not sure exactly when this Asian movie was made. Mid 90's early 2000's. But I think the absolute latest it could have been released would have been 2004.

 nbsp;

I think the English name of the movie was 2 words long.

 nbsp;

I "think" I had it on an **English dubbed VCD** (don't think I was ever able to track down a non-dubbed version).

Probably from ACF.

 nbsp;

I think the main character was a cop who was undercover.
I remember the main character being a little stocky.

 nbsp;

The one scene I remember was during the rain with a parked car. You could see the **rain hit the windshield in slow motion.** Possibly a kid was in the car? Some sort of **outside sidewalk steps** were in the background? Maybe there was a fight involving an umbrella? The scene had some sort of song playing while it happened. Fit very well in the scene.


Another scene later involved a fight at a warehouse. Possibly the last scene of the movie?

 nbsp;

I've spent hours reviewing movies and actors on Wikipedia, IMDB, loveKFFilm, HKMDB and yesasia and I'm unable to find out what it's called.

 nbsp;

Full Asian cast. Not a Hollywood movie.

 nbsp;

Actor's **NOT** in the movie:

Jet Li

Jackie Chan

Sammo Hung

Takeshi Kitano

Stephen Chow


I really want to say Chow Yun-fat is not in it. But when I browsed his Wikipedia page he was wearing a 
baseball hat. Which reminded me that the lead may have wore one and might have slightly looked like Chow Yun-fat. Reviewing his filmography nothing jumps out at me. And the time table of when the movie was probably made he was to big of a star to be in this.
**Is there a chubby/stocky actor that resembles Chow Yun-fat?**

 nbsp;

I don't remember guns being used. Maybe a baseball bat?
I think the movie was kind of humorous. Not Stephen Chow funny. But way less serious than Infernal Affairs.

 nbsp;

I think the lead wore **overalls** in one scene? Maybe the final one in a warehouse? And had a baseball bat, hat and a silly grin?
Maybe even the lead may have wore **overalls** the entire film?

 nbsp;

I wouldn't be surprised if this movie did not have an English Wikipedia page. Why? I've spent hours reviewing Asian actors/directors Wikipedia filmography pages and can't seem to find it. And it was far from a blockbuster budget film.

 nbsp;

It is **NOT** a sports movie.

It is **NOT** a Takashi Miike film

 nbsp;

The movie is **NOT:**

City on Fire

Infernal Affairs

Tiger On The Beat

Street Fighter (from the 70's)

 nbsp;

	<TEXT> You could use a HDMI splitter and have 1 Roku provide service for 2 (or more) TV's.

So whatever you have on TV 1 would be the same thing that is on TV 2.

I do that between my living room and my kitchen. That way if I get up to make a drink or grab a snack I don't have to pause the movie.

Probably won't work in larger households where multiple people want to watch different things. Just an idea though. </TEXT>

You could add the Unwatched filter before you create the playlist to limit down to episodes you've not watched.

Why do you only want X amount of episodes in your playlist?

If you want more manual control instead of a doing step 13 of my guide you could pick the episodes and add them individually to a playlist. You would do that by mousing over each episode. Select the 3 dots ... and then select Add to Playlist... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been a Netflix subscriber for years. Back before instant was even available. Then when instant came out you got both for free. Canceled the disk subscription part when they split instant off effectively doubling the price of what I was paying. Plus they were throttling mailing disks out if you mailed them back to fast.

It is still a great value to get them mailed to you. Especially since it's rare to even come across a video store nowadays. But instant has more than I need now.

You might also want to check out your local library. You might be surprised at how many Blu-rays they have to rent. Maybe even free.

FYI

Rule 3 of this subreddit:

This subreddit is for Netflix instant watch only (All regions instant watch is available are welcome to post. Just make sure you use the correct regional tag in the title.). Please redirect items only available for disc to/r/netflix.

If you're looking for some good movies to get mailed out you might want to subscribe to that subreddit as well. </TEXT>
