	<TEXT> I have a e46 325 so I'm sure there are engine calibrations/valve adjustments type things I am not aware of that the M requires, but do inspect all suspension components (bushings, tie rods, strut mounts etc) The car looks lowered, do you know what suspension is currently used? Also once the car is warmed up, stop the car facing up hill and try to take off a little aggressive to note any clutch slip. The car should have had at least one clutch replacement..if not its due! </TEXT>
