	<TEXT> I got married at 20 which is younger than a lot of people have said but it was the best thing ever for us. We'd already lived together for a year, and we'd done long distance before that and we just work together. I'd say if you know that you always have each others backs and are ready to commit to each other for life then age isn't really an issue. My grandma was 18 when she got married and her and my grandad are still totally in love 50 years later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We found ours on pets4homes online, he's a chihuahua and he came from a family in burton. Families with puppies also post on gumtree a lot, I know there's a lot of controversy but I'd definitely say visit the puppy at home before you pay a deposit or commit to buying. Often owners are really picky about who has their puppies which is a good sign! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see how, I'm not an expert on gun control, I doubt many of us are but I don't think that weapons designed to kill humans have any place in everyday life. Knives, axes - most other things used as a weapon have another purpose (cooking, chopping wood). Guns don't (apart from killing animals which I also don't agree with). And the number of massacres, murders and suicides associated with guns in America could possibly prevented by not having guns - I'm sure there are exceptions but the idea of going to the supermarket to buy a deadly weapon isn't going to help. I just don't see any valid reason for them.  </TEXT>
