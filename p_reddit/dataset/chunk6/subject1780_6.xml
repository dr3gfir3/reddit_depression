	<TEXT> To say that I didn't love her would be massively incorrect. I loved her more than any other person could fathom. It's just...she slowly started treating me just like the others. That's why she had to die. Before you judge and hate me for that, allow me to explain myself. Please?

Heather and I met on April 2nd, 2013. It was a cold day, 42 degrees. Snow was still on the ground and eleven schools in the city had closed that day. I was outside smoking a Marlboro 27, watching the world operate. A grumpy, older man was shoveling his driveway so his wife's Prius could make it up the apron. He hated her. They screamed at each other almost every night except for weekends, when he would to Woody's Tavern and fuck the house hooker. It caught up to him at 7:51am when he collapsed at the base of his driveway. No clutching. No visible pain. I heard Heather running across the street from her porch less than eight seconds after. She yelled for someone to call 911. No one else was outside.

It took the EMS exactly one minute to arrive. During the sixty seconds leading up to that, I had run to be by Heather's side and assist in the situation. She didn't understand how the human body works like I do. He was still breathing, albeit shallow. He had a low pulse, also. After the 12:02 the paramedics took to secure the grumpy man and leave with him, I hung back to comfort Heather. She was clearly overwhelmed by the situation. As it turned out, she never saw a man go down like that before. 

The rest is history. 

We became engaged one year and eight days after that incident. I proposed in front of her fireplace while we played Scrabble. I didn't win, but I did. 

Our plan was to move in together *after* officially tying the knot as to keep a modicum of tradition alive. Well, that was her plan, at least. I disagreed, but since we lived only 977 feet away from each other I was able to make due with the arrangement. I must admit, it did heighten my paranoia. Heather was so perfect and trustworthy that I didn't act on it like I had in the past. Besides, I was able to see into her living room from my attic as long as she didn't close the blinds - which she never did. 

Honestly, the only thing that really irked me about her was her unwillingness to do anything with me on the weekends. She was always busy with work. Alternating schedules, you see. I worked forty hours, Monday through Friday as a consultant at a tech firm. She typically worked retail hours randomly throughout the week, and then late shifts on the weekends at Denny's. I don't like not seeing someone I care about.

When she told me she was pregnant though, my prayers were answered. Over the course of eight months, two weeks, and four days, Heather slowly began working less and less - aside from her weekend job. She actually picked up a few more hours at Denny's but I was fine with it since she was always home during the week. Balance. 

I wasn't home when she went into labor at 3:16pm on March 8th. The wife to the grumpy old man saw Heather writhing in contraction pain on her porch and rushed to her aide. They made their way to the hospital as I hurried home to grab the baby bag we had prepared. 

The grumpy old man stopped me as I was leaving.

"Get a test done!" He yelled as he waddled across the street. "You'll regret it if you don't!" 

I stopped. Out of anger mostly, but also curiosity. It's not everyday someone tells you take a paternity test as your child is being born. 

"Woody's," he panted, "every weekend. She's popular." He didn't need to explain any further. I stared at him silently.

"I've been there. Anyone at the bar can prove it." 

That was enough for me. There had been four rumors before, but nothing substantial. I saved this man's life before, and I didn't see a reason for him to lie to me. I got in my car, but before I pulled out he knocked on my window. 

"Sorry. My wife...she isn't the best." He apologized as he motioned to his house.

"I'll deal with it." I sped off to the hospital. 

Heather didn't immediately go into labor - her cervix wasn't dilated enough - they had her staged in the room ready for the moment, however. She was too doped up to notice I was next to her. The problem with hospitals is that things often go wrong. Pumps malfunction and can disperse too many milligrams of a certain medication. Plugs can be tripped on in a panic, causing machines with alarms to cease making noise. When things like that happen, people fall into a bad place that's hard to recover from. When things like that happen to pregnant women, doctors might have to perform an emergency C-Section to save the baby's life before the mother dies. Usually only one can be saved. Usually the child. 

6:31pm, he was harvested from Heather's lifeless husk. 7 lbs. 7 oz. 21 inches long. I took comfort that he was dark-skinned since we lived in a city that was 88% white, and lived in an all-white development. I decided on the name Noah - Heather always loved that name. 

I was investigated and found guilty of some bullshit negligence charge causing my wife to perish. My lawyer was damn good, though. I served no time due to my clean record. 180 days of probation were all I had to serve. I was okay with that. 

Now that that's all settled, I need to find you.

You're next.

	<TEXT> "It isn't that I don't love you. I truly do with all of my heart. You're the chocolate cake to my fat stomach. I've realized that I'm simply not good enough for you - that's all. You can do better. I've been continually dragging you down for over a year now, and you don't deserve to deal with that any longer.

Honestly, I'm more of a burden to everyone and everything than I am a help. I'm a foul creature. Everything about me is false, frail, and ready to collapse. When was the last time I did something truly good to benefit anyone? I'm a pity party. I can't function alone. Hell, if it wasn't for you I might not be here today. I'm a waste.

Tell my boy I love him."

What helps me is writing in different subs. I'll dabble in some of the subs that have shorter word count requirements specifically. I find that even churning out a short 100-500 words is enough to help me bounce back creatively. 

I also have this problem where I get very bored doing the same thing repeatedly. So YMMV. Variety is worth a try! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Carving objects out of wood has always been a hobby of mine. Okay, not *always* - I picked it up after I started therapy. The sweet lady recommended that I find something creative that could keep my hands busy. 

*"Idle hands are the Devil's playthings."*

That was definitely one way to look at it. Regardless, it worked fine for a while. I would spend hours a day carving little spoons, people, and other cute objects. Fun. 

I got cocky, though, and stopped wearing my gloves. Of course I slipped and sliced the tip of my finger off. Hurt like a son-of-a-bitch. I don't like being in pain. It...irritates me. I went to that sweet lady's house and blamed her for my injury as my blood poured all over her carpets. She cried and tried to cradle me in an effort to calm my irritations but it wasn't enough. After all of the years of the same technique I had built up an immunity. I took my carving knife and cleanly sliced off her fingertip to replace my own. No effort - those blades are mighty sharp. Very...sharp. Sharp enough to carve ivory, I realized. 

I sell my carvings now. Ivory fetches a high price. More than wood ever could have.

Sorry, mama. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sunday, the first one of May. I got a phone call from the hospital around ten in the morning - my daughter had a severe seizure. Her roommate found her unconscious less than thirty minutes later, luckily. 

She wasn't epileptic, but has had a history of episodes starting not long after she starting dating that Kevin boy. He's had a history of seizures as well. I don't believe he's epileptic either. I doubt it's contagious.

The doctor told me that the only reason she didn't die was the memory foam bath mat that her head landed on, preventing it from cracking. </TEXT>

But since there's only one of him (not counting his new robot counterpart), you might want to try a different route.

-Post regularly, but focus on quality over quantity. 

-Don't write a series unless you intend on finishing it.

-Get involved with us here in the OOC and you'll learn stuff.

-Don't be a dick unless it's funny.

-Utilize /r/nosleepworkshops if you have doubts in your material.

-Message the mods with questions. I do it from time to time and they're always super helpful. 

-**Read the rules, wiki, and everything else. Thorough, Lee. Memorize it. Or just refer to it often. Rules, rules, rules.**

-Avoid cliches/tropes/overly big smiles with far too many teeth.../u/vainercupidOOC ;) or use them in a fresh, exciting way.

-Be /u/iia.

-There isn't a such thing as "the best time to post."

	<TITLE> I Wrote This With One Hand </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-01 16:33:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My father was tough. Strong. A manly man playing into the stereotype. Six-foot-five and built like an athlete, he protected all of his children from the invaders with ease. We all loved him dearly, and he loved us. Not just because of his protection. He showed us more kindness and compassion than any of our parents ever had. He wasn't willing to let us go.

That's how I imagined him being, at least. The truth is, I never met my dad. My mom was drugged and raped at a seedy downtown bar by a man with red hair. She woke up alone the next morning in a motel room in some town almost a hundred miles away from home. On the pillow next to her was a note that read:

*"I'm always watching. Waiting. Don't talk or I'll take everything."*

Understandably, she didn't go to the police. I can't exactly blame her for that. She was still loopy from the drugs and in an area that she had never been before with no idea how to get home. All she knew was that there was a death threat sitting next to her. No inclination as to how serious it was. 

She didn't talk. She didn't even go home. My mom ran away from it all and moved to Chicago. There, she tried to escape her problems and create a new life for herself surrounded by new people and new experiences. Nothing to remind her of what happened that night downtown. Aside from the occasional phone call home, my mom didn't exist in Ohio anymore.

After a couple of months, she began getting sick. Violently sick. To the point where she had no choice but to return home and get help. She hadn't managed to establish the life she wanted with her part-time server job at Denny's. My grandparents...they weren't exactly warm when they picked her up from the bus station. According to my mom, the word "disowned" was tossed around more than a few times. Knowing my grandparents they probably would have done it too - if she wasn't pregnant with me. 

By all accounts, the nine months she carried me were the one of the worst pregnancies anyone - including doctors - had ever seen. So bad, in fact, that every medical professional and even my *grandparents* shoved the option of abortion down my mom's throat. They all said she would die if she didn't get rid of me....obviously, that wasn't the case. I've been here for twenty-five years and my mom, twice as long. 

The doctors blamed every single mishap I had on my mom's decision to keep me. 

Lead poisoning? Bad kidney filtering. A normal kid could deal with the lead paint levels in our apartment. 

Asthma? Weak lungs. Genetics wouldn't affect my predisposition.

Night terrors? Poor brain development. I should have been able to rationalize that there wasn't a monster in my closet or under my bed.

Whatever I went through, if it wasn't perfect, it was my mom's fault for having me. It hurt. Even as a kid. I wanted nothing more than to make my mom proud. That's why I didn't tell anyone about the black man until I was almost fourteen. She didn't need to deal with any more of my "faults."

Deep down, part of me actually believed that my brain didn't work properly and that I was imagining it all. Logically, I felt like it didn't make any sense that a man could be living in my room. How could he eat? I wasn't allowed to bring food into my room. It never smelled - he had to go to the bathroom somehow, and wash himself. It didn't help that every time my mom would come check on me that he would vanish instantly in a plume of black mist. A real person couldn't do that. No one in the world was quick enough to go from my bedside to my closet that fast. I *had* to be making it up. 

Even deeper, though, fear kept me silent. Once my mom went to bed, black mist would pour through the keyhole in my closet door, filling my bedroom floor until it rose to a point next to my bed. The black man would sit on the edge of my bed, stroke my hair, and speak to me every night, for as long as I could remember. He was sincere in his grungy voice.

*"I'm just here to see you. Don't talk. I won't hurt, as long as you don't talk."*

He used the same opening statement every night as he sat down. Then he would sing lullabies just above a whisper. The classics. It was...soothing, in a way. My mom was always too tired to do things like that for me. It was always scary - even after hundreds of times. The black man just made me feel uneasy. I couldn't explain why. 

It was a few nights before my fourteenth birthday when I finally spoke up. I didn't mean to! I never thought anyone would believe me anyways. My mom was asking me what I wanted for my birthday and I asked for a camera for ghost hunting. She got a rise out of it, but when I told her I thought our house was haunted she went pale. She knew right away. 

After a long conversation about what I had been going through, my mom left the room and came back with a heavy, black leather book that had a silver inscription on it:

**Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?**

It didn't click until she explained to me what really happened the night I was conceived. 

My mom was raped. That part was true. It was the customary way in which a new Vessel was impregnated. The act had to be done with consent of the female and her parents, at an undetermined time during her twenty-fifth year...by force. This process allowed the seed to be planted with hatred and evil, so the chosen child would come from the womb ready to be groomed into the Recipient. This tradition originated centuries ago and has been unchanged since. My mom tried to run away from it, and my family - to give me a chance, but the black man found her and punished her, forcing her to come home. That's when I finally understood. 

**schwarzen Mann...**

**Schwarz...Mann**

**Schwarzman** - my last name. The Black Man.

I was too discombobulated to freak out about the new information. My mom was in tears but I must have been in shock. I didn't know what else to do. I went to my room and locked myself in. 

Hours passed as I sat in my room writing my last name over and over again. I didn't notice that night had come until I heard a gunshot downstairs. I ran to my door to check on my mom but it wouldn't budge. I screamed and pounded on it, hoping my mom would come to the door like all of those nights she checked on me...nothing. 

The black mist began filling my floor as I kept thrashing against my door. I felt a hand grab my wrist and I was pulled down to the floor. The mist swarmed around, covering me like a blanket as the Black Man pulled me under my bed. I tried pulling back. I wanted to fight. The best I was able to do was slow my inevitable descent into the darkness. 

The Black Man's face appeared in front of me - wispy blackness and piercing white eyes. He roared every time I pulled away from him, making the mist burn my skin at each tug. The lullabies he used to sing to me were blaring inside of my head. I didn't hear my door break down. My mom grabbed my legs and pulled on me using her body weight as leverage. I became a rope in a tug-of-war game. The mist around me formed into a hand with sharp fingers and the Black Man sunk his claws into my arm. It didn't cause me pain. He wasn't trying to hurt me, he was trying to infect me. My skin started turned gray and then black and flashes of white started eclipsing my sight. He wasn't willing to let me go. My mom didn't give up. She continued pulling my legs harder and harder...and harder. A pain unlike anything I had felt before radiated through my entire body from my shoulder as I went flying back into my mom's lap. Raspy, angry, whispers overtook the air as the Black Man formed in front of us from the mist. 

"I told you not to talk." Was all I could hear as he stood in front of us, staring into our souls with his empty white eyes. I couldn't move from the pain...my arm was torn clean off of my body and little by little I lost my ability to keep my eyes open. My mom, somehow, flicked on my bedroom light and everything vanished. It was done. My last clear memory is wishing she did that before.

It's been just over ten years. My mom is still alive and kicking, as am I. The Black Man hasn't come to bother me since that night, but according to the book my turn comes on my 29th birthday. 

He'llbe back.

	<TEXT> My father was tough. Strong. A manly man playing into the stereotype. Six-foot-five and built like an athlete, he protected all of his children from the invaders with ease. We all loved him dearly, and he loved us. Not just because of his protection. He showed us more kindness and compassion than any of our parents ever had. He wasn't willing to let us go.

That's how I imagined him being, at least. The truth is, I never met my dad. My mom was drugged and raped at a seedy downtown bar by a man with red hair. She woke up alone the next morning in a motel room in some town almost a hundred miles away from home. On the pillow next to her was a note that read:

*"I'm always watching. Waiting. Don't talk or I'll take everything."*

Understandably, she didn't go to the police. I can't exactly blame her for that. She was still loopy from the drugs and in an area that she had never been before with no idea how to get home. All she knew was that there was a death threat sitting next to her. No inclination as to how serious it was. 

She didn't talk. She didn't even go home. My mom ran away from it all and moved to Chicago. There, she tried to escape her problems and create a new life for herself surrounded by new people and new experiences. Nothing to remind her of what happened that night downtown. Aside from the occasional phone call home, my mom didn't exist in Ohio anymore.

After a couple of months, she began getting sick. Violently sick. To the point where she had no choice but to return home and get help. She hadn't managed to establish the life she wanted with her part-time server job at Denny's. My grandparents...they weren't exactly warm when they picked her up from the bus station. According to my mom, the word "disowned" was tossed around more than a few times. Knowing my grandparents they probably would have done it too - if she wasn't pregnant with me. 

By all accounts, the nine months she carried me were the one of the worst pregnancies anyone - including doctors - had ever seen. So bad, in fact, that every medical professional and even my *grandparents* shoved the option of abortion down my mom's throat. They all said she would die if she didn't get rid of me....obviously, that wasn't the case. I've been here for twenty-five years and my mom, twice as long.

	<TITLE> Chocoholic </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-29 19:15:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I spent almost four months looking for Otto.

He went missing shortly after the old chocolate factory began operating again. Allegedly - according to the reports, at least - there was an "incident" during a tour of the factory he went on. He fell into a stream of highly viscous chocolate, and was taken down to a separate part of the factory by the undertow. That was when my first bit of suspicion arose. It's a common misconception that a rip current can drag someone under water and down a stream. It doesn't work that way. 

Otto was retrieved by some factory workers in a separate room from where the incident occurred. Besides being covered in liquid gold, he appeared to be in perfect health. His mother verified this, as did the medical centre she took him to immediately after. Aside from being shaken up, Otto reportedly continued on with life as normal - even eating chocolate on a daily basis as he did prior to the tour.

My investigation wasn't into the incident, however. His mother squared that away with the CEO of the company not long after it happened. My involvement in the situation came after Otto went missing a month later.

His mother phoned the police first, who didn't take her claims seriously. Her reasoning that something was wrong was based on the lack of chocolate bar wrappers in his bed. I'll admit, when she came pounding on my office door yelling, "Help! There's no wrappers! My boy!" I also had a hard time taking her seriously. Money is money, though, so I let her into my office.

After an eternity of sobbing and giving unopened chocolate bars to me to examine, she was finally able to tell me all of the details of the incident and his behaviour since the occurrence, leading up to his disappearance.

According to Otto's mother, he began acting strange about a week after returning home from the tour of the factory. His chocolate intake almost tripled, and Otto needed chocolate bar every time of day. He would wake up in the middle of the night, sweating and screaming that he needed a chocolate bar immediately. Why she didn't see this as strange I never fully understood. He started skipping school roughly one week before he disappeared, but was always found behind the local candy shop scavenging through the waste bins looking for discarded chocolate bits. Again, I'll never understand why she didn't take him to a doctor. Part of me feels that she would let him eat so she didn't have to deal with tantrums. Opinions don't solve investigations, however.

I took the job. Mostly out of curiosity, although I won't deny that the hefty reward she was offering for an easy case swayed me a tad. While she might have been unable to accept it, at that time it was obvious to me that Otto had to be attempting to return to the factory. The job was only a matter of finding him along the way. It didn't sound difficult. They lived one country over and shared a land border with the city the factory was in. For a child of nine, the task wasn't exactly an impossibility. It was a day trip by train, two or three by car, and probably not much more by hitchhiking.

1.800 up front. 2.200 upon retrieval. And all I had to do was track his scent like a hound.

I should correct myself here, before I get too far. 

I did not spend almost four months looking for Otto. I found him within two week's time. The remainder of that period was spent attempting to infiltrate the factory to find him and rescue him. 

According to my sources, Otto made it to the factory approximately six days after he left home. They never attempted to contact his mother. 

Until a few days ago, I was unable to confirm visuals - it was all conjecture. The factory is highly guarded. It's probably closer to a castle than an actual factory. There's a gargantuan wrought-iron gate that surrounds the entire premises - easily taller than two men. Brown German Shepherds that freely roam the grounds. Guards that cover every one hundred feet, standing stoic as if they were members of the Queen's Guard. It took me the brunt of the past few months surveying the grounds every day to formulate a plan of action. The place is a goddamn fortress. One might think it's the vacation home to royalty. 

Getting inside wasn't the most honorable of tasks, but it needed to be done. The guards *never* changed shifts. The dogs *never* went indoors. I...I hate to admit this, but I have to: I went through...the septic tank. It was left unguarded underground, with about half of it exposed to the sewers. Yes, it was disgusting. I don't think the smell will ever cease to haunt me. There were no other options. I crawled through those pipes, almost getting stuck a few times along the way. Luckily, no flushes happened. I came through a large manhole in the floor under what appeared to be a series of tubes that chocolate was flowing through. The area was small, but just big enough for me to crawl through on my hands and knees - had I been a little person there's a chance that I could have walked, I guess.

I crawled under the tubes for quite some time, until they rose up and a ledge leading down to a cold, stone hallway appeared. I checked for guards - nothing. It was deserted, and I was in luck. After a minute of walking down that hallway I came to a heavily beaten door that read:

**Aut....rized P..rso....el**   
**W..nki..es Only**

Jackpot. At least, I hoped it was.

I jimmied the lock in the handle and slowly cracked open the door. A smell overtook me. Worse than the filthy waste water covering my body. It was flesh, rotting flesh and...chocolate. Not the pleasant chocolate smell I was used to. This was spoiled milk, with cacao mixed into it. My entire body began convulsing as I gagged. I didn't want to go in. I pondered it as I heaved. Was the 4.000 worth whatever I was going to witness? 

Yes. Yes, it was. 

I opened the door wide enough to squeeze my body through. It was dark, but not entirely blacked out. It was akin to a bedroom with a nightlight. I had to wrap my dirty shirt around my face to be able to stand the smell. There were spotless metal tables lining the walls of the room, along with shelves full of tools and empty cages. Along a huge, empty wall was a table filled with computers and paperwork. I went there first to search for answers. 

`Supply Chain Four`   
`Status: Low`   
`Action Required: Fill`   
`Please press "Enter" to initiate replenishment sequence`

Those were the only words on the screen, with "Enter" blinking in bold, blue letters. I could toggle out of the screen, nor cancel the status inquiry. So I did what I had to do and initiated the replenishment.

The wall behind the computers illuminated in a blinding fluorescent white light as the turning of gears and machinery overtook the room. The first thing I noticed was the crane moving down an overhead track carrying a net full of blue and green striped spherical fruits. They weren't anything I had ever seen before. As I followed the crane with my eyes it led to an area that was sectioned off by fencing with barbed wire across its top. Bursting out of that fencing was Otto...or something that resembled him. It was a lumpy blob of white skin, covered in purple stretch marks and deep red cracks. The was some sort of mouth on top of the flesh mound that was being kept in a gaping open position by some sort of forceps. As the crane lowered itself into position just over the creature's mouth, it grunted repeatedly in approval over the meal it was about to be given - like a baby bird when it's mother returns with a worm. The fencing began shaking violently, and a bunch of little men ran into the area from panels in the walls, stabbing the blob with some sort of electrical rods. It stopped moving.

The crane released the net, and dozens of those strange coloured fruits fell into it's mouth. The ones that fell were tossed up and into it's mouth by some of the smaller men without electric rods. A machine wheeled into the the area and a tube emerged from the front of it, facing the front of the fenced area. The men opened the side of the fence and the machine extended the tube straight into a fold in the blob's center. It let out a cry of pain as a brown sludge sloshed it's way down the pipe to the machine.

"Otto. He loves chocolate so much, he was eager to take a job here." A voice pierced through the drone of machinery. I jumped and looked behind me, but there was no one in the room. I ran for it. Back through the door. Up the ledge. Back through the manhole cover and out to the sewers. I made it back to my hotel faster than any taxi could have gotten me there.

I have no idea how to inform his mother of what's happened to her son. I don't really know what to do myself, honestly. Every morning there's a delicious chocolate bar sitting on my pillow. They know what I've done. They know where I am. I know I shouldn't be eating the chocolate. I know it's a message. It's just so good. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Chocoholic </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I spent almost four months looking for Otto.

He went missing shortly after the old chocolate factory began operating again. Allegedly - according to the reports, at least - there was an "incident" during a tour of the factory he went on. He fell into a stream of highly viscous chocolate, and was taken down to a separate part of the factory by the undertow. That was when my first bit of suspicion arose. It's a common misconception that a rip current can drag someone under water and down a stream. It doesn't work that way. 

Otto was retrieved by some factory workers in a separate room from where the incident occurred. Besides being covered in liquid gold, he appeared to be in perfect health. His mother verified this, as did the medical centre she took him to immediately after. Aside from being shaken up, Otto reportedly continued on with life as normal - even eating chocolate on a daily basis as he did prior to the tour.

My investigation wasn't into the incident, however. His mother squared that away with the CEO of the company not long after it happened. My involvement in the situation came after Otto went missing a month later.

His mother phoned the police first, who didn't take her claims seriously. Her reasoning that something was wrong was based on the lack of chocolate bar wrappers in his bed. I'll admit, when she came pounding on my office door yelling, "Help! There's no wrappers! My boy!" I also had a hard time taking her seriously. Money is money, though, so I let her into my office.

After an eternity of sobbing and giving unopened chocolate bars to me to examine, she was finally able to tell me all of the details of the incident and his behaviour since the occurrence, leading up to his disappearance.

According to Otto's mother, he began acting strange about a week after returning home from the tour of the factory. His chocolate intake almost tripled, and Otto needed chocolate bar every time of day. He would wake up in the middle of the night, sweating and screaming that he needed a chocolate bar immediately. Why she didn't see this as strange I never fully understood. He started skipping school roughly one week before he disappeared, but was always found behind the local candy shop scavenging through the waste bins looking for discarded chocolate bits. Again, I'll never understand why she didn't take him to a doctor. Part of me feels that she would let him eat so she didn't have to deal with tantrums. Opinions don't solve investigations, however.

I took the job. Mostly out of curiosity, although I won't deny that the hefty reward she was offering for an easy case swayed me a tad. While she might have been unable to accept it, at that time it was obvious to me that Otto had to be attempting to return to the factory. The job was only a matter of finding him along the way. It didn't sound difficult. They lived one country over and shared a land border with the city the factory was in. For a child of nine, the task wasn't exactly an impossibility. It was a day trip by train, two or three by car, and probably not much more by hitchhiking.

1.800 up front. 2.200 upon retrieval. And all I had to do was track his scent like a hound.

I should correct myself here, before I get too far. 

I did not spend almost four months looking for Otto. I found him within two week's time. The remainder of that period was spent attempting to infiltrate the factory to find him and rescue him. 

According to my sources, Otto made it to the factory approximately six days after he left home. They never attempted to contact his mother. 

Until a few days ago, I was unable to confirm visuals - it was all conjecture. The factory is highly guarded. It's probably closer to a castle than an actual factory. There's a gargantuan wrought-iron gate that surrounds the entire premises - easily taller than two men. Brown German Shepherds that freely roam the grounds. Guards that cover every one hundred feet, standing stoic as if they were members of the Queen's Guard. It took me the brunt of the past few months surveying the grounds every day to formulate a plan of action. The place is a goddamn fortress. One might think it's the vacation home to royalty. 

Getting inside wasn't the most honorable of tasks, but it needed to be done. The guards *never* changed shifts. The dogs *never* went indoors. I...I hate to admit this, but I have to: I went through...the septic tank. It was left unguarded underground, with about half of it exposed to the sewers. Yes, it was disgusting. I don't think the smell will ever cease to haunt me. There were no other options. I crawled through those pipes, almost getting stuck a few times along the way. Luckily, no flushes happened. I came through a large manhole in the floor under what appeared to be a series of tubes that chocolate was flowing through. The area was small, but just big enough for me to crawl through on my hands and knees - had I been a little person there's a chance that I could have walked, I guess.

	<TEXT> Here to help!

First things first: your story is a tad bit shy of the /r/nosleep word requirements. You must have at least 500 words to a story, and I have you at 493. But that won't matter by the end of this ;)

I have very little time left, and I know it. I have been getting... visited, so to speak, from my son every single night. He's five, so you might be thinking this is a sweet story, but you would be wrong. It started when he was around 3. My wife heard this strange clicking noise in the middle of the night, and she sent me to investigate as anyone would do in her position. She was a mother, and she had raised three children... she needed her sleep, and I was ever willing to provide her with this one simple luxury. I was the one who got up in the middle of the night now whenever anyone needed help. It shouldn't have been this way. A boy needs his mother, and it should have been her. The clicking noise was mine to investigate, though, so there I was searching the house for the source. It took a few minutes to realize the sound was coming from his room.

**Good way to establish a setting in a shorter story. No need for unnecessary build-up or background. Simply "this is who am I and this is happening." Personally, saying a child needs their mother as opposed to any parent rubbed me the wrong way, but I understand the logic and that I'm probably an outlier. Anyways. Short and sweet. It can work.**

I found him standing up, motionless. The clicking noise was coming from his mouth. He was chewing something. I walked up to him slowly and gently, so as not to frighten him. I got down on my left knee and began to reach over to touch his shoulder when it hit me. When I walked into the room I had focused directly on this child in the corner, but now that I was closer, there was someone in the bed. Someone small. It was my son... I just knew it.

**I would begin this paragraph with some adjectives to establish the scenery. Describe the room. Were you nervous? Also, state that he was in the corner early on. I didn't understand it in my first reading. I had assumed you went to his bed/crib. To end it, maybe you can say that you picked him up to put him in bed and saw a child already in his bed. Or something. I think you can understand my point.**

I must be dreaming, I thought... obviously this can't be real. I got the sudden sensation that I should not take my eyes off this other one. Why was I here again? The clicking noise. Jesus that noise... what is he chewing?
I put my hand on this other boy who is also my son, and he turned to me with a face that destroyed me. I have never seen someone smile like that. This was my son alright... he was a smiley happy kid, but this was different. It's what was IN his mouth that destroyed me. He was chewing a finger... his own finger. The clicking noise was the sound of his own bones breaking as he gnawed on them.

**Tense is a little odd to me in the first sentence. Maybe try "I thought I was dreaming. This obviously wasn't real." Avoid the word "sudden" and just say what you felt. Also, when you're telling a story in past tense you don't want to interject your thoughts as if you were experiencing them in the present. It throws the flow off.**

Now I looked at the boy in the bed. THIS was my son... but the bed was bloody, right near his finger. I scream and then I'm waking up in bed to my son crying hysterically next to me. He's screaming more than anything... he had a nightmare about a boy biting him.

**I mean. Solid, basically. Just tensing issues.**

Every night has been this way. Every night my wife wakes me up and I go into his room and find the boy chewing a new body part. Every night, my son comes into my room to tell me about the nightmare.
For the past week, though, he no longer wakes me up screaming. He just stands there counting my fingers.

**"Every night has been this way since then."**

Overall, solid premise and creepy idea. If you're aiming for a short, creepy story I believe this is all you would need to nail it. If you wanted to expand this into a longer, terrifying story it might take a lot more in terms of building suspense and describing scenes. I think it's best as it is though, minus the few things I pointed out.

	<TEXT> My Aunt Rose was such a drag. Honestly! I always despised going to her house for holidays. Her attitude towards us "kids" (the youngest being 17 years, 3 months, and 18 days old at the time of the events detailed in this letter) was nothing short of condescending, and she made a point to be judgmental of the adults. None of us liked going there, but our family was stuck in a unique position - Aunt Rose was well-off due to her $216,884.13 annual salary, making her the only one capable of hosting a holiday. We all had no choice but to grin and bear it or risk not having a proper holiday. 

Now, don't get me wrong. While my Aunt Rose was the single ugliest, most detestable creature on the inside, her beauty could not be argued...post-divorce. When my Uncle Mark left her on November 3rd, 2006 for a significantly more pleasant woman named Angelica, my aunt went off of the deep end. 

Thomas Carlyle once said: "the greatest of faults is to be conscious of none." Aunt Rose suffered from the greatest of faults. She managed to avoid the realization that being around her for more than twenty-four minutes could drive a Navy Seal to madness. No. She became obsessed with vanity - blaming Angelica being young and beautiful as the reason Uncle Mark left her. She scheduled her first surgery for May 11th, 2007 - exactly one month before the divorce was to be finalized. 

It began with facial reconstruction. Then lip implants. Nip, tuck. Nip, tuck. Liposuction. Aunt Rose always had rather large, 32D breasts but she wasted no time getting them "perked-up" as well.

$86,010.00 accompanied by two years, one month, and six days and Aunt Rose was a new woman. A "young" woman, with a body that could rival any aging pornstar...and she knew it. 

It was the Thanksgiving of 2011 that ended my family's disdain for holiday gatherings. 

Aunt Rose - since her surgeries - didn't attempt to hide her promiscuity. She also became a master of introductions. My aunt brought a new date to every gathering she hosted or attended. In 2011, unfortunately, it was Charles. 

When we arrived on the early evening of Thanksgiving, Charles was posted at the door ready to greet us and take our coats, bags, and food trays. He was a handsome, older man (54.5) - clean shaven with salt and peppered hair and piercing blue eyes. He donned a stunning brown bespoke suit and a sharp blue tie that almost matched his eyes. Much to my family's surprise, Charles seemed like a good catch for Aunt Rose. He was pleasant, well-spoken, and appeared to match my aunt's lifestyle in every possible way.

It took one hour and twelve minutes after my sister and I arrived for dinner to be served. A little longer than the usual wait time from previous years because Aunt Rose wanted to show-off her new boy toy. As the cooks brought out the trays for dinner, my sister made the mistake of getting up to go to the restroom, causing one cook to drop a tray full of sweet potatoes that were topped with roasted pecans and brown sugar. It went everywhere. 

"Sit in your place you filthy nigger!" Charles erupted as he leapt up and pointed to the chair my sister was in. 

My father, bless him, damn near flipped the table onto Charles in a fit of rage I hadn't seen since I was a boy. Amidst the screaming and arms swinging, my sister ran off to the bathroom in hysterics. It was 6:18pm. 

At 6:21pm, Aunt Rose ducked away from defending Charles to go check on my sister. For as terrible as she was, my aunt was no stranger to the effects of racism - especially on younger people. I followed suit at 6:22pm after taking an elbow to the neck while holding my dad back from being charged with manslaughter. 

It was now or never. This was inexcusable and needed to end.

My sister was alone when I made it to the bathroom. Still sobbing, but consolable. I assured her I would take care of everything as long as she stayed put. Aunt Rose was in her private bathroom. At 6:29pm, I shut off the main fuse. The house went dark. As my family temporarily contained their anger to look for candles and flashlights, I made my way to the private bathroom. Aunt Rose was sitting on the closed toilet, touching herself by candlelight. When I burst in, instead of shock...she asked me if I would like help. I accepted. She smiled.

I reached into my wallet and removed my plastic safety measures. Carfentanil. One milligram. It's an extremely potent elephant tranquilizer. So strong, in fact, that a flake as small as a grain of salt can kill a human when absorbed through the skin. I started carrying some with me after one person I know was killed, and they linked me as a suspect. It didn't look like an accident like it was supposed to. I was sloppy. This provided me with an easy out if there were any...mistakes.


As Aunt Rose seductively walked up to me and pressed her artificial naked body against my clothes, I grasped her jaw with my left hand and emptied the contents into her mouth with my right. 

"You want to drug me? *Kinky.*" She said as she sat back down and caressed her body. "Come fuck me."

I humored her. As I undid my belt and unbuttoned my shirt, she began gagging uncontrollably. I refastened my buttons and left. My job was done. I returned to my sister at 6:53pm. The light came back on at 6:57pm, when one of the cooks found the fuse box and returned the switches to their original states. When my sister and I returned to the dining room Charles had already excused himself. Dinner was ruined, but morale in the room was so strong you could feel it. My family accomplished something that night. We stood our ground. We didn't lay down because of Aunt Rose and her wealth. We became a new family that night. A unit, that didn't need the depths of a pocketbook to enjoy holidays. We all left and went to an Asian restaurant and feasted on the single best duck I've had in my entire life. 

Aunt Rose was found the next afternoon at 1:07pm by her evening housekeeper at the start of her shift. Apparently her African American cooks were not a fan of Charles and his slurs, and left not long after we did without even bothering with pay. Aunt Rose was purple. I wish she would have been red, just for the irony.

Holidays since that day in 2011 have been nothing short of fantastic. You'll enjoy them with us, I promise.

Our family is renewed.

Be Thankful,

	<TEXT> We take life for granted. Every second, minute, hour, and day goes by on autopilot. We complain about the mundane lifestyles we live. We get upset that we follow the same routines week after week after week. We'll plan vacations - getaways from our normal lives in hopes that it will reignite the spark we once had for spontaneity and enjoyment. Then we'll get home and fall back into the same routines. Nothing changes. Rinse. Repeat. We hate it, yet we relish in the safety of normalcy. If everything stays the same, nothing bad happens. It's predictable. We know the cause and effect, the action and the reaction.

And then you lose someone.

My phone rang while I was at work, a little after returning from my lunch break. It was a number I didn't recognize. Typically, I tend to shy away from answering unknown numbers - old debts and such. This felt...different. I can't explain how. Maybe it was intuition. I answered. 

"Mr. Davis, this is Nurse Thomas from the Cleveland Clinic. There's been an incident with your wife. We require your presence here at the hospital as soon as you can get here."

Nothing can jumpstart a heart rate faster than an unexpected call from a hospital. The nurse assured me that my wife was alive and conscious, but couldn't release any more details until I was at the hospital. Those next few moments are gone from my mind forever. I suffer from semi-regular panic attacks and I'm used to the blind actions adrenaline can cause but...this wasn't typical. I can only assume I started bawling, as my first clear memory after that phone call was sitting on the floor surrounded by my coworkers and some concerned customers. I managed to drive myself twenty minutes to the hospital, although I'm honestly not sure how. 

Intensive Care Unit, Room 2125. 

My wife was laying there on a hospital bed hooked up to more machines and intravenous lines than any one person should be. Her neck was a gradient of purples and reds that was either making its way up to her sweaty, pale-green face or receding from it. It didn't matter to me. I gave her a kiss on the forehead and a whisper of love. 

"Mr. Davis, may I speak with you in private?" Nurse Thomas quietly said to me with a hand on my back. 

"Your wife has a severe systemic infection, caused by a lodged kidney stone. Her kidneys have been failing rapidly and without emergency surgery...it doesn't look promising." 

I've never understood how someone could willingly take on a career that involves informing people that their loved ones are going to die.

"Well perform the surgery! What are you waiting on me for?" I yelled at her, releasing some of my inner angst. She didn't deserve it.

"Your wife needs a new kidney. Today. They have both dipped below 30% functionality. Without a new one, her body won't be able to filter out the infection. We would normally attempt to fully stabilize a patient first but...well, I'm sure you can understand the urgency of the situation."

"How long is the wait on the donor list?" 

"There isn't. We need a live donor." Her sympathy was genuine. I wasn't expecting it from someone in this profession. "Are you willing to be tested as a match for your wife?"

Life paused. 

When I woke up that morning I made myself two pieces of toast with melted butter and strawberry jelly - my go-to breakfast on the days I worked. I ran my Keurig to fill my travel mug with coffee as I took a five minute shower and groomed myself for the work day. I picked out a plain, subtle red tie and tied it into a trinity knot in an attempt to make more of a bold statement at work. Maybe garner some attention from my boss. I mixed my cream and sugar into the coffee. I let the dogs out and fed them breakfast - 3/4 cup dry for one, 1/4 cup with a little water for the other. I set the plates and bowls out on the table for the kids' breakfast, and put two different cereals on the counter for them to choose from. I went to work, but right before I left I turned on the lamp so our youngest wouldn't be afraid of the dark. My wife slept the whole time, as she normally would. 

Was I willing to immediately undergo surgery and give up one of my kidneys to save my wife? Could I live without it? Could I live without her? 

What about the kids? How would they deal without having a mom? What if one of them needed a kidney one day? I certainly wouldn't be able to donate one. 

I imagined my life without my wife there.

I set bowls out on the table for the kids' breakfast, and filled them with cereal. I turned on the lamp so my youngest wouldn't be afraid of the dark. As I tied my shoes, the nanny let herself in and set her things in the coat closet. I went to work.

"Mr. Davis? Mr. Davis is everything okay? Would you like to sit down?" Life unpaused.

"Sorry. It-it's just a lot to take in. Can I think about it for a few?" Her wince answered my question for me. "I...I can't do it. I can't take that risk of anything happening to both of us. We have kids! Dogs! I'm sorry-"

"Sir, if you are a match and you refuse to donate you're signing your wife's death certificate." A doctor interrupted me as he walked to us from down the hall. "That's something you have to live with. It's one thing if you aren't a match, but if you are...well, I believe the results here are clear." 

"I can't do it. Isn't there another option? Maybe her brother or someone?" 

"Mr. Davis, you're here *now* and we need to perform the surgery *now.* We can attempt to find an alternative, hell, one that might even have a better chance of being a match. But we can test you now, while we reach out to relatives. *Time is vital right now,* Mr. Davis. We need to act, and we need to act fast."

"I'm sorry...I just-"

"She will die without a kidney! Do you not understand the situation here?! Dammit!" His anger oozed out of his pores as he threw his clipboard on the floor. "Thomas, get a list of her kin together and make those phone calls. Mr. Davis, I would suggest you have a long talk with your wife." He walked off. I could feel the disgust from the onlookers.

I went to my wife's room where I found her with eyes wide open and some tears streaming down her cheeks. She didn't need to tell me she heard everything. The purples and reds were spreading up her cheeks and her eyes were slightly milky and yellow. She was a victim of poisoning and her body was the assassin.

"I know why-" she forced out between breaths, "you don't want to do it." 

"Babe, what if something happened?" I was shaking, crying on the inside, but I held it together as best I could for her. 

"Don't worry about it. I'll be fine. I love you." 

"I love you too. I do. I do so much." 

She closed her eyes and that was it. Those were the last words I ever exchanged with my wife.

Her brother also refused to donate, although he at least came to get tested. It was his cold feet after finding out he could do it that made him back down. He blamed me for her death. The kids weren't old enough to fully grasp what's going on, but I felt their resentment as well. Life was no longer the same, and it never would be again.

I booked a vacation for the kids and I a couple months after her passing. A nice, little getaway from the shakeup and the reminders of their mother. Nothing spectacular - just a trip down south to Columbus for the weekend. Maybe create a few smiles and laughs before we went back to the gloom and stagnation of real life. 

The first night in the hotel, around 12:30am., is when I heard the first scream. A high-pitched squeal that woke me up. I ran to the kids and they were fast asleep. I searched all of the rooms. Turned on lights. Opened closets. It was just the three of us. I assumed it must have been an issue in a room down the hall and that as long as it didn't come to our door, I wasn't going to stress myself out. I went back to bed.

As I laid there on my back, staring into the eternity of the ceiling, something started moving. Forming, rather. A black, swirling mist was permeating the space above me as food coloring would when dropped into water. It grew. As it kept gaining mass, it slowly solidified into pieces - body parts made from darkness. 

The screaming began again.

"You let me die you fuck!" I recognized the voice immediately.

"Where are my babies?! You took them from me!"

One voice was becoming multiple as the screams grew more intense and vengeful. It wasn't just my wife yelling at me as she often did. 

The pieces came together. My wife was above me, staring down into my being with bloodstained eyes peering out behind her black eyelids. 

"You let me die. You filthy, pathetic excuse for a man. Lieutenant Angle wouldn't have let me die. He *always* took care of me." She snarled. Our marriage wasn't perfect, but I let the affair slide. She was looking to shake things up. She needed excitement. I loved her. I understood.

"Pervert! Pervert! Pervert! Pervert!" She screamed again, pointing towards my groin. "You're going to Hell for that one!" She laughed. I let the affair slide, but I must admit, my wife wasn't the only one who needed a getaway. 

"Stop!" I yelled back on the verge of an emotional breakdown. I closed my eyes and covered my ears, but her screams of "bastard" and "killer" seemed to stem from inside my head. 

Then it all stopped.

I ran and checked on the kids - asleep. Room was still empty. I rushed into the hallway - empty. I sat on the couch and watched the news until the kids woke up in the morning. 

We went to the malls. The Lego Store. All of the fun little eateries and some really great restaurants. 

My wife was the woman in a blue dress in the crowded mall. 

My wife rang us out at the Lego Store. 

My wife served us pizza and sighed when she brought the check, knowing her tip would be small.

I don't know if the kids see her. My little girl has woken up a few times laughing at the darkness. When I've asked her who she's talking to, she just tells me not to worry because Lieutenant Angle will keep her safe. I've petitioned the courts for a paternity test.

	<TEXT> My obsession with being warm started 8.3 years ago, when I was living in a rundown studio apartment. It was a rodent's nest, surrounded by eleven other equally disgusting dens. My neighbors were cretins - all fifteen of them - and the slumlord was no better. 

Lisa was, by all accounts, a whore who only owned my building to have a safe haven to turn tricks. In the thirteen months I resided there the police came nineteen times and arrested exactly *zero* people. Zero. She knew her way around the law, and this apartment complex was her "get out of jail free" card. It's hard to imagine the police weren't keeping tabs on her, waiting to pounce on the slightest slip-up. Too bad she got away.

Personally, I never had any issues or concerns with the apartment building or my fifteen co-inhibitors. They kept to themselves. I kept to myself. Tawnya, the resident dumpster, asked me to sleep with her on eight separate occasions but other than that I was essentially a ghost. Well, a ghost to all but Lisa. I can't imagine what it was, but she was drawn to me by something. A lust created by my mystery and isolation, perhaps?

Lisa would come to the building twice a week - 11:30 a.m. on Tuesdays, and 4:30 p.m. on Fridays. She was never late, like a good business woman. I was always her first stop on Tuesdays and her last stop on Fridays. 

Tuesdays were great. Her usual arrival time - when I would hear the knock on my door - was approximately 11:37 a.m. (11:36 a.m. if we're talking means). She would greet me with a large hug, squeezing me so tightly that I'm surprised her breasts never ruptured. We would chat for between six and eleven minutes about how I'm doing and if I had any fun plans coming up, and she would fill me in on anything I needed to know involving the building. Great. Curt, brief, and professional. 

Fridays, however, defined the word "juxtaposition" for me. The knocking on Fridays varied wildly. I can't confidently confirm any approximate times, which made it hard to plan around her. Some Fridays she would be at my door by 5:05 p.m., whereas other days she would show up as late at 7:44 p.m.. Madness. Her visits lacked all semblance of professionality. Lisa would always wear a tank top with no bra, letting loose her bolted-on nipples regardless of weather conditions. She would caress my door frame while speaking in a rehearsed sensual tone, asking if I "needed anything." I didn't. I would have left if it wasn't for my *lovely* annual income of $21,318.42. 

Given my lack of options, I tolerated the situation for as long as I could. Until my heat stopped working on February 18th. 

Lisa, in her infinite kindness and obsession with me, was more than happy to fix the issue - if I had sex with her. Needless to say, I declined. Her visits stopped, and my apartment grew colder and colder by the day. 

I wasn't willing to give into her. 

I took my issues to the city council, who directed me to the housing board. I was promised on March 4th that they would resolve the matter no later than March 11th. A week was less satisfactory than I had hoped for, but I wasn't in a position to barter. 

March 11th - nothing.

March 12th - nothing.

March 15th - nothing.

My patience was diminishing significantly faster than the temperature. Too many calls unanswered. Too many questions ignored and deflected. Lisa had a hold on me, all because she wanted to hold me. 

March 17th, a Friday. Some know it as St. Patrick's Day. I know it as the holiday that usurps my birthday plans every year. It was also the day I decided to take matters into my own hands. 

Lisa came to the building at her usual 4:30 p.m. time, darting quickly between tenants in order to avoid my notice. *Fault number one*. In her haste, she had neglected to notice that there were chains on the building doors and nails in every single window. I had *a lot* of time to prep, as the junkies I lived with spent most days on street corners and dirty carpeted floors. I worked my way down the stairs in a slight haste, as to not miss my opportunity. That's where I ran into Lisa. *Fault number two.* She didn't notice me in her rush. Had she of taken two seconds to look at me, she might have noticed the two 5.5L kerosene tanks I was carrying with me. 

Once I reached the outside, I made sure to secure the chains and the perimeter - couldn't have any witnesses. Luckily for me, junkies and whores don't operate in the daylight. I poured the kerosene tanks into the vents, drenching the kinder I had already placed in them. A decent amount, approximately four or five fluid ounces spilled on me because of my nervous shaking. I was concerned that I lost too much to finish my plans, but it was too late to turn back.

With the flick of a lighter, the heat was fixed. 

It took four minutes and eighteen seconds before the flame reached a point where Lisa noticed. 

Five minutes and four seconds until I heard her pounding on the main doors, crying for help.

Eight minutes exactly until I saw her in the fourth floor hallway window.

Eight minutes and twenty-four seconds until she dove through the window, landing on her legs and snapping them into pieces. 

After my hands were sufficiently warmed from the flames, I walked over to Lisa to check on her. Apparently bones that tear through skin smell like almonds - who knew? As she laid there, it was clear that she wanted to cry but couldn't, presumably due to the shock and a drug cocktail she no doubt had at some point that day. I'll admit this, although I hate to, but my curiosity *did* get the best of me. I wanted to know if they were real or not. I took my keys and rammed the longest one into her left breast, breaking directly into the skin. I pulled my key down to her nipple and, well, they were real. 

Renters Insurance paid for $3,029.00 of my property lost during the fire. I used most of that for reallocation purposes - I'm sure you can understand. My apartment now is significantly nicer, and I haven't had any issues with heating. My thermostat stays at a constant 85 degrees. The only issue I'm begging to have is in terms of space. Almost every month, I lose a little more room to another body that follows me home. 

It might be time for another insurance claim.

Yours Truly,
