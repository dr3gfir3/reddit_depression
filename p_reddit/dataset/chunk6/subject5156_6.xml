	<TEXT> I don't really see your point. He was charging  $3 for shipping which is basically what it will cost him. People on bricklink are also running businesses for the sole purpose of making profits, not selling a few figs here and there for kicks. 90% of people on here use bricklink to look up prices and are only on here to find better deals than bricklink.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really buy this. I've never seen a member of US special forces in real life, but I've heard of them. They're on the news. A galactic conflict would have gotten a lot of news coverage in a technologically advanced society. There must have been 24 hour news coverage with footage from every battle. I mean, just think about episode III when a massive star ship crashes into Courascant. What about the thousands and thousands of clone troopers who eventually retired from the army and rejoined society? They saw first hand the power of the Jedi. You could say the Empire tried to destroy the memory of the Jedi, but you still have Vader talking about the force and choking people. Why would he do that if their goal was to keep the force secret? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I went to my local wal-mart this weekend looking for Anakin's Custom Jedi Starfighter, 75087. It was listed as in stock, and for only $9.00 on the wal-mart app. I couldn't find it in the store, so I asked someone who worked there. He looked on the shelf and it wasn't there, but he told me I could order it online and have it shipped to the store for free. I asked him if I would get the clearance price of $9.00 and he said yes, it would be the in store price. I've seen a lot of other posts on here about people doing something similar, but I've got proof from an employee that it should work. I looked on brickseek and found a nearby store with a Millennium Falcon for $35 and I used the app to have it shipped to the store for pickup. I'm having a friend pick it up for me, so I'll report back and let everyone know if they gave him any hassle. </TEXT>

You trade:

That's almost a $10 plus in your favor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got all three of these sets for $25! I honestly couldn't believe it.

7679 was about 99% complete with minifigs and instructions. Basically all that was missing were a few antenna.


8039 had instructions but just the two clone minifigs. It was missing close to 50 pieces, mostly some interior stuff like Palpatine's desk, and the escape pod. It had the bomb dropping mechanism and the clone turret thing.

10178 did not have minifigures or instructions. It was missing close to 100 pieces, mostly details on the "head part". The motor still works, and it walks great!


I've spent about $50 on bricklink orders, and they're much closer to complete at this point, just missing a few small pieces here and there. I've also spent about $18 on some of the missing figs. So all told, I'm into these three sets for about $95...not too bad at all! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been out of the Yu-Gi-Oh card game for a long time, but I have about 300 cards I would like to get rid of individually, or as many as people would like to buy at once. Not really sure how many of them are rare or valuable, but willing to sell all of them.

I have a trade cards online [profile here](http://www.tradecardsonline.com/im/editCollection/collection_type/1/target_user_id/354778/game_id/14) which you can use to browse my cards. I can provide any pictures requested. Most cards are in mint condition, I mostly collected and did not play with them.

I tried to read the rules as closely as possible, but if any part of this post is not allowed, mods, please delete. Thanks for browsing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Clone Turbo Tank, Republic Gunship and Jango's Salve I are definitely worth some money. That Mace Windu figure alone can go for $15-$20. And if you have Jango Fett, that figure can go for $40. You can check prices on bricklink.com or look at sold listings on ebay to get an idea. There's also /r/legomarket. I'd be interested in the Arc 170 if you wanted to sell.

edit: just noticed you have the green scout trooper from the turbo tank too. That guy is also worth $15-$20 on his own. </TEXT>
