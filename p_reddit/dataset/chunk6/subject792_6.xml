 Sissoko played well, but he completely ruined pogba and Griezmanns game, something you wouldn't notice or care about if there was an end product but because there wasn't, i wouldve subbed him off on at least 70 mins.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, i'm a little confused at how i should feel with the king in da norf speech. Sure it was rousing, but we know Jons not neds son. We know hes a targ. Maybe, littlefinger knows too. But it felt like the people in the room were accepting him mainly because he was neds son. Do you think it would it matter to any of them when its revealed that hes not? 

They didn't seem to care he was a bastard, but would they care that hes a targaryen? If littlefinger knows, then maybe thats his way in.

	<TEXT> I don't read any book series really, so i can't say. Sharpe, from way back in the day, was great. I love Gomorrah, but haven't read the book to base it off. I think the walking dead is terrible, but very enjoyable to casually watch at the same time. 

Just to be clear, i love watching game of thrones (most of the time). The first few seasons, maybe up to 4, were great. I wasn't bothered about the changes so much, because the in show logic stayed pretty true. But the last couple of seasons they have very clearly shifted direction, and target audience. They are much happier to produce 1 or 2 visually impressive episodes, than to spends time with characters. Its been dumbed down basically. 
They're quick to respond to any criticism with budget, or time or whatever, but i think its just cuz theyve changed from making a great show, to making the biggest show they possibly can. They go searching for the hashtags and the memes now. They use shock value to entertain the audience, rather than the audience being entertained by a 'shock'. It just seems like they don't care about it anymore. Certain directors bring episodes to life, but they can't undo the mad plot points and inconsistant logic. 

I try and enjoy it as popcorn now, but certain things still rattle me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah some people get personally offended when people criticise the show, when clearly, theres plenty wrong with it. I can like the show and praise parts of it, aswell as shame it for all of its mistakes. You're allowed to do that!

Yes the citadel looked great. To be fair i think Danys scenes have been pretty strong. She gets a lot of abuse, but i think her actings fine. The sheer power of Drogon has been made very clear this season. And the score has been awesome, minus that strange piano thing. Thats my real problem with it tbh, they seem to be happy with just get the cinematics looking great for the 'big scenes' and forget all the important joining up bits. Where its the 'joining up' parts that makes me love the books so much.

I often wonder how show only viewers handle these things, but obviously you don't get many on these boards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ok, so plot 'holes' is probs a stretch tbh. The majority are the long standing plot 'points'. The absence of Ghost. Davos only now finding out what happen to Shireen. Sansa basically fucking over jon by not telling him about the vale army and then Jon not ripping into her about it in this episode. Tommen throwing himself out the window after little or no character build up that would suggest this. The sandsnakes killing the martells off becuase they wouldnt avenge the death of other martells, and then in this episode it turns out theyve just been sitting around in dorne not avenging the death of the martells anyway. The timeline was insane, who knows what happened when and how long inbetween scenes from arya, jaime and varys in particular. After going so slowly all season, this was crazytown. Aryas pies were thrown in like a last minute thought, it had no impact, never mind being implausible.


It had all the pieces here, it just all fell flat for me. I've kinda had enough of it by now, so i find myself becoming super critical of everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When they realise they've actually forgotten to include Jons direwolf! Ghost! 

I thought there was something missing, and it just dawned on me! I know its such a huge show and they are so busy and there was so much going on in this episode with dragons and what not, so i do feel a litle bad for them as its an easy mistake to make. Really someone shoulve pointed it out to them BEFORE it aired, so i think theyll be a little annoyed at the director and the writers for not noticing earlier. But wow what a big mistake by them to forget him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rami plays like the waterboy whos been thrown on in the cup final and doesn't know what he's doing or why he's there.


 A lot of the french players seem to look around them for someone else to take control of the game. Who woulda thought, frenchmen with no conifidence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ah yeah, i like this. It makes sense that the freys would suspect the lannisters and it would be a pretty uneven fight. 


I will be disappointed if Bronn dies in this though, he's done fuck all this season. Wouldve been better if he died in Dorne.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's at the wedding, and looks like hes eating the food drinking the wine, but i don't think he'll die there. And obviously i'm expecting dead freys a plenty. 


I'm kinda predicting/hoping that Arya takes out a few freys and as jaimes out taking a piss or something, sees her, and remembers his promise to cat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hoped the closing shot would be the white raven flying towards winterfell, but shownlies will not get that, so maybe thats the opening scene. 


I really want Jon to be pissed at Sansa, cuz he fucking well should be. 

End shot has to be something that links to the fact that the whites are a coming, so i'm going for tiny little scene from the wall reminding us how loveable ed is, then a 3 blast of the horn. END SCENE. </TEXT>
