	<TEXT> Thank God for hypocrisy -- "the tribute that vice pays to virtue" (La Rochefoucauld).  Israel is a cross that too many Jews feel they have to bear.  I am a Jew by ethnic origin.  I believe that Israel was a forced solution for Jews fleeing from continental Europe.  Everyone who had the power to stop them entering their territory did so.  The historic religious tie of Jews to Palestine made a bad alternative look good.  It might have worked if the rights and interests of Arabs had been respected.  There have always been some Jews in Israel who understood the debt that Israeli Jews owe to Palestinian Arabs. But nationalism has always trumped spiritual and moral concerns.  Thus the endless ongoing tragedy.  It is not too late, however, to change the trajectory.  A secure existence for Jews in Israel depends on the creation of a prosperous democratic society for Palestinians.  That will require more than reparations.  It will require working relations, and building a basis for mutual trust.  Accepting at least a small number of Syrian refugees should be on the agenda for a new Israel-Palestine.  How do we start the long process towards a sane peaceful future?  I would start by supporting HIAS's call for welcoming and resettling some Syrian refugees in the United States.  Drown the hysteria with facts on the ground.  Refugees have always become Americans. That's the ever-renewing source for American resilience.  It has been a model for the world, and that model is worth defending.  It is model that Israel would do well to consider in plotting its own future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Virtually all of Mr. Trumps falsehoods directly bolstered a powerful and self-aggrandizing narrative depicting him as a heroic savior for a nation menaced from every direction. Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, described the practice as creating an unreality bubble that he surrounds himself with.

It's not like Hillary tells the truth.  But most of her lies are complex fabrications, difficult to deconstruct. That's why I'm voting for Jill Stein. But I live in New York, so its a free vote, with no prospect of changing the election outcome. If I lived where the contest is at all close, I would vote for Clinton. Not because I believe her, but because it's possible to engage in rational discussion, organize around real issues, and hope to force her to honor the concessions she made to Bernie Sanders, like opposing TPP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Identity Politics moves us towards wider freedom only when the group (race, religion, gender, ethnicity, etc.) is seeking full inclusion, equality, an end to stigma.  Once the dog has caught the car -- the group has achieved autonomy, a place it can call its own (or, at least, equality, as people in a complex multi-identity society) -- then it is time to reconfigure.  That means taking responsibility for the consequence of our actions on others, but also working with them to make things better for us all.  It's difficult to accept complexity, let alone embrace it.  But freedom is enriched by it.  It's the identity worth fighting for.  At one time the idea of American Exceptionalism was supposed to be about that kind of vision.  Are we too poor in spirit now to keep that complex vision as our goal?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is technically a crime in the US to "knowingly" hire illegals. That "knowingly" loophole helps to explain why a paltry 50 or fewer people a year are convicted of hiring illegal aliens. To create plausible deniability, employers need only view documents establishing legitimacy; the documents themselves need not be legitimate. Employers are under no obligation to spot fakes, even if the forgeries are downright hilarious.

Let's start with a clean-slate and legalize current resident workers and their families.  Then there's a chance to control future systematic evasion by employers with a self-enforcing policy: undocumented workers can be given the incentive to become informers.  Such workers would be given green cards by turning in their employer.  The employer would be penalized with a $15,000 payment to each undocumented employee who comes forward (i.e., minimum wage for one year). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Read what the man has to say, and then ask yourself: What does it mean to be American?  The attempt to turn "American" into an ethnicity is a disaster.  We are Many -- not One.  We are a mongrel lot, and need to be proud of it.  It is reactionary utopianism to think we are better off ("more secure") by turning away from our historic roots as an intentional community of people who choose free interchange under law.  The common bond of shared ideals is why the immigrant North won over the white homogeneous South.

That's what Marines, and all Americans who have served to defend this country, have to understand.  You can't just defend people like your own family and the folks you go to church with.  It doesn't work that way.  It only works when we understand we are different, but defending a common ideal.  And it works better when we try to understand each other -- even those whose tastes and backgrounds are quite different from our own.  You might call that Politically Correct.  But it is the bedrock of an American Exceptionalism that's worth fighting for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry for the oversight.  This legislation, if not stopped, would be the defense of Bad History through the coercive power of the state.

I thought the "bad history" embodied in this law would be obvious.

For me, Bad History is a biased view, usually serving to support an unstated agenda.  But here that agenda is made explicit:

Polands far-right government defends this legislation as an effective legal tool in counteracting assertions that Poland and its people have any responsibility for the crimes of the Holocaust. The law is intended to combat what the government calls lies that are detrimental to Polands image and that the government considers to be found mainly in the foreign media.
It is not our mothers, not our fathers, who are responsible for the crimes of the Holocaust, caused by German and Nazi criminals in occupied [Poland], Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said at an August 16 press conference. Our duty is to defend the truth and dignity of the Polish state, and the Polish nation, but also of our fathers, our mothers, our grandfathers.

So the "defense of the truth and dignity... of our fathers..." requires the suppression of inquiry and evidence that would convince fair-minded people to reach a contrary understanding of the past.

But Pena Nieto just said No anyway, to make it perfectly clear.  At the press conference afterwards, Trump doubled down on cowardice, claiming that the subject had never come up. So Pena Nieto tweeted that Mexico had preemptively rejected Trump's non-proposal.  And then Trump found his courage.  He gave his Phoenix crowd the red meat they craved, bellowing that Mexico will pay for the Wall, but they don't know it yet.   A perfect day for a loud bully with a short stick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is why the private insurance model doesn't work.  ACA helps expand coverage.  But now the sick chickens have come home to roost -- getting care they previously couldn't afford -- and their lives are not profitable to insure.  So private insurers get out, or jack up rates.  Leaving us with a problem:  EITHER throw the sick ones overboard (unless they have the cash to pay their own bills) -- i.e., repeal ACA for Republican "consumer-driven" private health care, OR recognize that we've kicked the can down the road to a dead end, and have to replace the private insurance model with tax-financed health care for all, where we're all in, and the healthy pay up front to cover the current sick, knowing that they will be covered when their turn comes.  That's civilized -- a quaint concept, don't you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contrary to statements made by the Trump campaign during the Republican convention, the city, not Mr. Trump, built the golf course at Ferry Point, for $127 million. Four years ago, in a deal finalized under Mayor Michael R. Bloombergs administration, the Trump Organization came on board to operate the course, assume the expense of upkeep and build a $10 million clubhouse, yet to be erected.... The structure of the deal the city forged with the Trump Organization at Ferry Point does not require it to remit licensing fees to the city until 2019, at which point the company will pay 7 percent of gross revenue... If the entirety of Ferry Point Park, which serves a poor surrounding area, were well kept, then the presence of the golf course, meant for marketing executives in Westchester County and bond traders in TriBeCa, might be easier to tolerate. Sitting on the southeastern shore of the Bronx, Ferry Point is a vast park, bifurcated by the Whitestone Bridge. In addition to the golf course, it encompasses a nine-acre green space and playground bordering a public-housing project, just beyond a fence along the fairway, and a second area, west of the bridge. But despite all the money that went into building the course, the park, created in conjunction with it, still did not have bathrooms last year. This year, the bathrooms are in place, but the park is so poorly shaded that parents in the neighborhood said it continued to be rarely used... None of the money earmarked by the mayor to make the citys parks system more equitable has ever been directed to Ferry Point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a serious and detailed set of proposals, held together by the vision of an American future which has done the job that justice demands -- that succeeds in eliminating racial disparities.  It is a big task, and if some of the proposals seem "unrealistic" that is because systemic racism is a deep part of how this country is organized.  The focus may appear confrontational with existing power.  But the genius of the BLM platform is that it speaks to issues of justice and democracy which extend to all of us.  The process of winning these struggles would require, for example, free or affordable public college for everyone, oversight of law enforcement by all of our communities, etc.  And to make that actually happen, a lot of people have to become public citizens.  A lot of people understanding the need, and taking on civic responsibility is the way we take back communities from despair and violence, and from there we can take on the broader task of building a sustainable future.  The BLM Platform is a serious starting point for the discussion and action ahead.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the article:
 Among the list of grievances in the Declaration is the rarely scrutinized He [referring to the king] has excited domestic insurrections amongst us. This grievance was motivated by Virginia Royal Governor Lord Dunmores November 1775 proclamation stating that any person held as a slave by a colonist in rebellion against England would become free by joining the British forces in subduing the revolt. While 5,000 mainly free Black people from northern colonies joined with the colonists fight for independence, few of our school books teach that tens of thousands more enslaved black people joined with the British, with an even greater number taking advantage of the war to escape the colonies altogether by running to Canada or Florida. They saw they had a better shot at Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness with the British than with their colonial slave masters. General George Washington never matched the British proclamation by offering to free slaves who joined his Continental Army. </TEXT>

Trump did not condemn the publishing of the photos, and even seemed to approve of it.  Melania was one of the most successful models and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines, Trump told the Post. This was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.

Who knew what a tolerant, large-hearted soul Donald would turn out to be?  We now understand his master plan: It is in our shared appreciation of human beauty that we will find our common bond, which will bring us all together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that's what's happening at all.  Instead, I think that Murdoch has smelled blood and decided that the Donald is a loser.  Rather than go down with him, Rupert wants to claim the prize as Trump slayer.  If I'm right, Fox News, with Ailes decapitated, and directly under the control of Rupert, will now show how "fair and balanced" it can be at Trump's expense.  Murdoch was never a true conservative.  If Trump had been credible, Murdoch would have been only too happy to have a downscale right-wing populist in power, making the world safe for Murdoch enterprises.  But Trump is a fool, and Murdoch is not.  And if Trump doesn't defend Melania, what does that make Donald? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is Donald Trump inciting an Assault? Under the rule of [law](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/assault):

Assault

At Common Law, an intentional act by one person that creates an apprehension in another of an imminent harmful or offensive contact.
An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm. It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in either criminal or civil liability. Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and Tort Law. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is Trump certifiable?
Lets allow the man to speak for himself:
After facing predictable attacks by Democrats, the man who calls his opponent Crooked Hillary told an Iowa rally:
I mean, the things that were said about me, I was going to hit a number of those speakers so hard their heads would spin, theyd never recover!

Trump then got specific:
I was going to hit one guy in particular, a very little guy. I was going to hit this guy so hard his head would spin. He wouldnt know what the hell happened.

Who might that little guy be?
Trumps Friday tweet:
Little Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!

Hmm. At a news conference two months before the end of Bloombergs term, Trump turned to him and said: Mike, I have to say, you have been a great mayor.
Tweets a year before praised both Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly for their leadership in bringing down violent crime.

	<TEXT> "Thousands Got Naked and Painted Their Bodies Blue for Climate Change"  So what does it all mean?  It's surely not a rational argument.  It's not to convince anybody.  But it does express a very real human need: to believe that our expressions gain power and meaning when we act with a common purpose as one.  Lift Every Voice and Sing, or lie down together in the street naked.  It doesn't matter.  It feels like the human spirit unleashed.  And it is much more satisfying than cynicism.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The study is based on the limited data that is available, from cities which volunteered to provide data compiled from the reports by the police themselves.  Beyond that reporting bias, it's presented in terms of rates of lethal and (various types of) non-lethal force used, per 10,000 incidents, by race.  This does not tell us how many instances of being stopped by the police any person will encounter over a lifetime.  (For Philando Castile, the number was 52.  Had his life not been cut short, it would have been in the hundreds.)  The study only gives the chance of being subject to some form of physical force when confronted by the police (for blacks, over 20%).  And it says nothing about the proportion of police actions which are directed against innocent people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have always needed immigration. We still do. Immigrants need a welcoming community. Syrians, fleeing an ongoing holocaust, need a home. What do people who are blind to the suffering of others deserve? Pity? Contempt? Or only to remain unnoticed when they themselves are in need.
We know what is right, but Americans increasingly feel that they are in a losing battle as workers. Some get high rewards (especially in the financial sector), but most have lost bargaining power, and work-life is precarious. We have been pitted against each other, against immigrants, and against workers in other countries. In the face of lost futures, we are descending into a war of all-against-all. That's not a choice. That's not a way to live a good life.
The key to welcoming immigrants (especially people whose survival is at stake) is to build an America that meets real needs and is sustainable. That requires conscious choice, purposeful action, and, yes, clear policy choices made by our elected government. There's more than enough work that must be done if we are to achieve that goal. That would make America great again in spirit. But we must (as Bernie Sanders says) think big. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Getting beyond retrograde populism requires recognition that globalization won't go away.  Declining living standards for most people in the old wealthy world will continue, with or without immigration, unless there is a vision for our global future in which we move towards a better life for most people where they already live.  Then immigration would be a matter of personal and cultural choice rather than economic necessity.  Right now the world is increasingly being destabilized by the failure of states to meet the basic needs of their people.  Climate change is a major disruptor that has revved up the chaos, especially in the Middle East and East Africa.  Unless we stop hiding from this reality, it will inexorably overwhelm us.
